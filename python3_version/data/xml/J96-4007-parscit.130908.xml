Intelligent Language Tutors is an edited collection of papers on intelligent computer-
assisted language learning (ICALL), a young discipline that seeks to apply the tech-
nology of natural language processing and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) to enhance
language learning. The result of a 1993 workshop sponsored by the Army Research
Institute, the book may be seen as a parry to Swartz and Yazdani&apos;s (1992) book on in-
telligent tutors for foreign language learning; it therefore takes not an EU perspective
but a North American one.
ICALL is inherently multidisciplinary, and the editors have sought to include pa-
pers with a sound theoretical basis in, for example, linguistics, language pedagogy, and
cognitive psychology. The twenty papers are grouped into four sections according to
the aspect of student knowledge addressed: text-based tutors and learning environ-
ments; dialogue-based tutors and language games; graphics-based tutors and learning
environments; and theoretical issues in language tutor design and assessment. There
is an introductory chapter that looks at why ICALL has a low profile and what makes
it worth doing. In addition, each section is prefaced by a short introduction that head-
lines the systems covered and draws out the main issues that emerge.
Section 1, text-based tutors and learning environments, examines text-based sys-
tems that have a parsing focus and an emphasis on grammar teaching. Systems cov-
ered include BRIDGE, CALLE, ALICE-chan, the McGill language-learning environ-
ment, and the GPARS suite. The BRIDGE tutor makes use of a Government-Binding
parser in a multimedia tutoring system in classroom use, and its NLP component
and authoring components are examined in some detail. In the ALICE-chan system,
students answer questions by typing in Roman character transliterations. The input
is parsed into an LFG-style feature structure by a form of LR-parser before being
matched against both correct and buggy parses. The LFG representation used enables
the system to cope with a variety of student inputs in a restricted domain in an ef-
ficient manner, and the parser is additionally employed to facilitate authoring. The
McGill language-learning environment can be compared to the expertise module of
a traditional ICALL system but instead of emphasizing the grammatical aspects of
language, as many older ICALL systems are wont to do, the system seeks to improve
both generic and more domain-specific discourse skills with a focus on situated, com-
municative learning, subdivided into &amp;quot;modules&amp;quot; which may be used alone or in sets.
Pattern-matching techniques are used to handle input and output. The GPARS suite
Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4
consists of a transition-network parser, which can be used for student error diagnosis,
language development, and competence evaluation.
Issues raised in this section include the compactness and efficiency of the gram-
mars and parsers, the merits of network-based parsers for modeling competence, and
error diagnosis and feedback.
Section 2, dialogue-based language games, covers just two systems: SPION and
Herr Kommissar. The systems have a focus on text, but also include supporting graph-
ics. Both systems are microworlds involving role-playing, and operate within a re-
stricted domain. It is interesting to note that students using SPION found the non-
ICALL version less intimidating, as it did not accept totally free input. Herr Kommissar
employs a parser and discourse model with a case grammar. As the system seeks to
provide students with practice in language production, it eschews a student model
and notions of generative error models in favor of a model of student activity and
the engaging of students in communicative practice. The key issue here is that of the
importance and nature of feedback required for effective language learning.
Section 3, graphics-based language tutors, covers systems that use graphics to
model a physical microworld and, therefore, offer a measure of immersion language
learning. Systems covered include FLUENT, MILT, LINGWORLDS, and the related
Athena language project. Two papers are devoted to each, so that the pedagogic and
computational aspects of each system can be fully covered. FLUENT is a conversa-
tional ICALL system with a large NLP component and principled dialogue manager.
The system employs sophisticated Al techniques, a student model to guide response
production, and a minimalist tutorial component. LINGWORLDS concentrates on au-
ral comprehension, which the student evidences by appropriately manipulating a mi-
croworld in response to speech. The system did not, at the time of writing, contain a
major NLP component, but the writers of the system had engaged in lesson observa-
tion as a motivation for their system; this is still quite unusual in ICALL. In rooting
the system in a formalized language-learning pedagogy, the team was able to con-
cretize and evaluate some of the theoretical ideas employed. The Athena papers look
in more detail at the NLP heart of FLUENT (e.g., the parser, linguistic theory, and er-
ror handling) and the MILT papers look in detail at the NLP component of BRIDGE&apos;s
successor system, underlining the importance of semantics to ICALL. In MILT, seman-
tics are handled by lexical-concept structures, which offer a uniform, primitive-based,
multilingual description of language. While the techniques discussed are ideal for
question-answering systems, the issue of inference still needs to be tackled.
Issues arising from this section include the role of the microworld in constraining
student input and the complexity of the NLP required, the current lack of formalized
theories of language teaching that can be directly employed in ICALL, the extent to
which more behavioral language-teaching theories may still have a role to play, the
role of graphics in overcoming the need for students to produce the foreign language,
and the authorability of intelligent courseware.
The final section, on theoretical issues in language tutor design and assessment,
seeks to assess the contributions made to ICALL research by the systems covered
in the book. The papers cover some basic questions to be answered in ICALL eval-
uation studies, the importance and potential benefits of ICALL research to artificial
intelligence, linguistics and language learning (with interesting discussion of the po-
tential red-herring debate around grammatical or communicative ICALL), the role of
the teacher, and current theories of language learning that ought to be considered in
ICALL design.
Intelligent Language Tutors suffers from the usual coherence problems associated
with collections of papers. Even though there is some cross-referencing, there is little

in the way of introduction to language teaching, ITS, or NLP architectures and termi-
nology, and hence some grounding in ITS as well as Al, NLP, and language teaching
is required; we are still awaiting a Wenger for ICALL (cf. Wenger 1987). This aside, the
book is interesting reading for researchers interested in ICALL, and should provide a
good overview of the North American scene in a single volume and pointers to works
of interest, as well as provoking new thoughts. The book is in many ways a call to
further research.
