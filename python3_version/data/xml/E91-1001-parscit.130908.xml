Towards Reusable Linguistic Resources
Abstract

<listItem confidence="0.987268230769231">
1. The paper will try to identify the various concurrent factors which, in
the last years, have contributed to the increasing attention paid to the
issue of reusable linguistic resources for natural language processing.
The role of various major Organisations (EEC, Council of Europe, DARPA,
NEH, etc.) will be examined, taking into account the reasons which seem
to have stimulated their active participation. The recognition of the need
of reusable linguistic resources by various sectors of &amp;quot;automated
linguistic data processing&amp;quot; will also be considered as a catalyzer for the
recent trend towards the cooperation of various scientific and professional
Associations (ACL, ALLC, ACH, etc.).
2. Various interpretations of the term &amp;quot;reusability&amp;quot; have been proposed. We
shall consider the relationships and differences between:
- the feasibility of the utilization of existing repositories of

linguistic information, as potential sources for the construction
of NLP components;
- the feasibility of constructing new large linguistic knowledge bases,
explicitly designed for multifunctional uses, in various research
frameworks and development activities.
In particular, we shall examine the connections between various core aspects of
the construction of reusable linguistic resources, and
- the general problems of the &amp;quot;evaluation&amp;quot; in the field of natural
language processing, both at the general level of shareability of
the state-of-the-art knowledge, and at the level of specific NLP
systems or linguistic data collection;
- the design of &amp;quot;standards&amp;quot; at the level of representation formalisms
and of the identification of linguistic units and description
categories.

3. Examples will be taken by some of the various international projects
nowadays underway in the field of lexica (ET7, Acquilex, Multilex, Genelex,
The lexical Consortium, etc.), corpora (European Network of Textual
Corpora, British National Corpus, Data Collection Initiative, etc.), and

represent major controversial issues. It is expected that the round table,
which will be held during the Conference with the participation of the
representatives of some of those projects, will discuss these problems and
indicate priorities for research, practicable ways towards their solution,
and possible convergence of efforts.
