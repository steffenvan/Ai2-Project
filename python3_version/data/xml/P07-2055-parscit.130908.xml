In this paper, we present a hybrid method for
word segmentation and POS tagging. The
target languages are those in which word
boundaries are ambiguous, such as Chinese
and Japanese. In the method, word-based
and character-based processing is combined,
and word segmentation and POS tagging are
conducted simultaneously. Experimental re-
sults on multiple corpora show that the inte-

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is an important task
in natural language processing, and is often neces-
sary for other processing such as syntactic parsing.
English POS tagging can be handled as a sequential
labeling problem, and has been extensively studied.
However, in Chinese and Japanese, words are not
separated by spaces, and word boundaries must be
identified before or during POS tagging. Therefore,
POS tagging cannot be conducted without word seg-
mentation, and how to combine these two processing
is an important issue. A large problem in word seg-
mentation and POS tagging is the existence of un-
known words. Unknown words are defined as words
that are not in the system’s word dictionary. It is dif-
ficult to determine the word boundaries and the POS
tags of unknown words, and unknown words often
cause errors in these processing.
In this paper, we study a hybrid method for Chi-
nese and Japanese word segmentation and POS tag-
ging, in which word-based and character-based pro-
cessing is combined, and word segmentation and
POS tagging are conducted simultaneously. In the
method, word-based processing is used to handle
known words, and character-based processing is
used to handle unknown words. Furthermore, infor-
mation of word boundaries and POS tags are used
at the same time with this method. The following
sections describe the hybrid method and results of
experiments on Chinese and Japanese corpora.

2 Hybrid Method for Word Segmentation
and POS Tagging
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887111111111">
Many methods have been studied for Chinese and
Japanese word segmentation, which include word-
based methods and character-based methods. Nak-
agawa (2004) studied a method which combines a
word-based method and a character-based method.
Given an input sentence in the method, a lattice is
constructed first using a word dictionary, which con-
sists of word-level nodes for all the known words in
the sentence. These nodes have POS tags. Then,
character-level nodes for all the characters in the
sentence are added into the lattice (Figure 1). These
nodes have position-of-character (POC) tags which
indicate word-internal positions of the characters
(Xue, 2003). There are four POC tags, B, I, E
and S, each of which respectively indicates the be-
ginning of a word, the middle of a word, the end
of a word, and a single character word. In the
method, the word-level nodes are used to identify
known words, and the character-level nodes are used
to identify unknown words, because generally word-
level information is precise and appropriate for pro-
cessing known words, and character-level informa-
tion is robust and appropriate for processing un-
known words. Extended hidden Markov models are
used to choose the best path among all the possible
candidates in the lattice, and the correct path is indi-
cated by the thick lines in Figure 1. The POS tags
and the POC tags are treated equally in the method.
Thus, the word-level nodes and the character-level
nodes are processed uniformly, and known words
and unknown words are identified simultaneously.
In the method, POS tags of known words as well as
word boundaries are identified, but POS tags of un-
known words are not identified. Therefore, we ex-
tend the method in order to conduct unknown word
POS tagging too:

The method uses subdivided POC-tags in or-
der to identify not only the positions of charac-
ters but also the parts-of-speech of the compos-
ing words (Figure 2, A). In the method, POS
tagging of unknown words is conducted at the
same time as word segmentation and POS tag-

ging of known words, and information of parts-
of-speech of unknown words can be used for
word segmentation.
There are also two other methods capable of con-
ducting unknown word POS tagging (Ng and Low,
2004):

Word-based Post-Processing Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990736842105">
This method receives results of word segmen-
tation and known word POS tagging, and pre-
dicts POS tags of unknown words using words
as units (Figure 2, B). This approach is the
same as the approach widely used in English
POS tagging. In the method, the process of
unknown word POS tagging is separated from
word segmentation and known word POS tag-
ging, and information of parts-of-speech of un-
known words cannot be used for word segmen-
tation. In later experiments, maximum entropy
models were used deterministically to predict
POS tags of unknown words. As features for
predicting the POS tag of an unknown word w,
we used the preceding and the succeeding two
words of w and their POS tags, the prefixes and
the suffixes of up to two characters of w, the
character types contained in w, and the length
of w.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.831353">
Character-based Post-Processing Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976555555556">
This method is similar to the word-based post-
processing method, but in this method, POS
tags of unknown words are predicted using
characters as units (Figure 2, C). In the method,
POS tags of unknown words are predicted us-
ing exactly the same probabilistic models as
the hybrid method, but word boundaries and
POS tags of known words are fixed in the post-
processing step.
Ng and Low (2004) studied Chinese word seg-
mentation and POS tagging. They compared sev-
eral approaches, and showed that character-based
approaches had higher accuracy than word-based
approaches, and that conducting word segmentation
and POS tagging all at once performed better than
conducting these processing separately. Our hy-
brid method is similar to their character-based all-at-
once approach. However, in their experiments, only
word-based and character-based methods were ex-
amined. In our experiments, the combined method
of word-based and character-based processing was
examined. Furthermore, although their experiments
were conducted with only Chinese data, we con-
ducted experiments with Chinese and Japanese data,
and confirmed that the hybrid method performed
well on the Japanese data as well as the Chinese
data.

<bodyText confidence="0.970481916666667">
We used five word-segmented and POS-tagged cor-
pora; the Penn Chinese Treebank corpus 2.0 (CTB),
a part of the PFR corpus (PFR), the EDR cor-
pus (EDR), the Kyoto University corpus version
2 (KUC) and the RWCP corpus (RWC). The first
two were Chinese (C) corpora, and the rest were
Japanese (J) corpora, and they were split into train-
ing and test data. The dictionary distributed with
JUMAN version 3.61 (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998)
was used as a word dictionary in the experiments
with the KUC corpus, and word dictionaries were
constructed from all the words in the training data in
the experiments with other corpora. Table 1 summa-
rizes statistical information of the corpora: the lan-
guage, the number of POS tags, the sizes of training
and test data, and the splitting methods of them1. We
used the following scoring measures to evaluate per-
formance of word segmentation and POS tagging:
R : Recall (The ratio of the number of correctly
segmented/POS-tagged words in system’s out-
put to the number of words in test data),
P : Precision (The ratio of the number of correctly
segmented/POS-tagged words in system’s out-
put to the number of words in system’s output),
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9943005">
1The unknown word rate for word segmentation is not equal
to the unknown word rate for POS tagging in general, since
the word forms of some words in the test data may exist in the
word dictionary but the POS tags of them may not exist. Such
words are regarded as known words in word segmentation, but
as unknown words in POS tagging.

Table 2 shows the results2. In the table, Word-
based Post-Proc., Char.-based Post-Proc. and Hy-
brid Method respectively indicate results obtained
with the word-based post-processing method, the
character-based post-processing method, and the hy-
brid method. Two types of performance were mea-
sured: performance of word segmentation alone,
and performance of both word segmentation and
POS tagging. We first compare performance of
both word segmentation and POS tagging. The
F-measures of the hybrid method were highest on
all the corpora. This result agrees with the ob-
servation by Ng and Low (2004) that higher accu-
racy was obtained by conducting word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging at the same time than by con-
ducting these processing separately. Comparing the
word-based and the character-based post-processing
methods, the F-measures of the latter were higher
on the Chinese corpora as reported by Ng and
Low (2004), but the F-measures of the former were
slightly higher on the Japanese corpora. The same
tendency existed in the recalls for known words;
the recalls of the character-based post-processing
method were highest on the Chinese corpora, but
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.997148333333333">
2The recalls for known words of the word-based and the
character-based post-processing methods differ, though the
POS tags of known words are identified in the first common
step. This is because known words are sometimes identified as
unknown words in the first step and their POS tags are predicted
in the post-processing step.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894375">
those of the word-based method were highest on
the Japanese corpora, except on the EDR corpus.
Thus, the character-based method was not always
better than the word-based method as reported by Ng
and Low (2004) when the methods were used with
the word and character-based combined approach on
Japanese corpora. We next compare performance of
word segmentation alone. The F-measures of the hy-
brid method were again highest in all the corpora,
and the performance of word segmentation was im-
proved by the integrated processing of word seg-
mentation and POS tagging. The precisions of the
hybrid method were highest with statistical signifi-
cance on four of the five corpora. In all the corpora,
the recalls for unknown words of the hybrid method
were highest, but the recalls for known words were
lowest.
Comparing our results with previous work is not
easy since experimental settings are not the same.
It was reported that the original combined method
of word-based and character-based processing had
high overall accuracy (F-measures) in Chinese word
segmentation, compared with the state-of-the-art
methods (Nakagawa, 2004). Kudo et al. (2004) stud-
ied Japanese word segmentation and POS tagging
using conditional random fields (CRFs) and rule-
based unknown word processing. They conducted
experiments with the KUC corpus, and achieved F-
measure of 0.9896 in word segmentation, which is
better than ours (0.9847). Some features we did
not used, such as base forms and conjugated forms
of words, and hierarchical POS tags, were used in

The precisions of the hybrid method were highest with statistical significance on four of the five corpora. In all the corpora, the recalls for unknown words of the hybrid method were highest, but the recalls for known words were lowest. Comparing our results with previous work is not easy since experimental settings are not the same. It was reported that the original combined method of word-based and character-based processing had high overall accuracy (F-measures) in Chinese word segmentation, compared with the state-of-the-art methods (Nakagawa, 2004). Kudo et al. (2004) studied Japanese word segmentation and POS tagging using conditional random fields (CRFs) and rulebased unknown word processing. They conducted experiments with the KUC corpus, and achieved Fmeasure of 0.9896 in word segmentation, which is better than ours (0.9847). Some features we did not used, such as base forms and conjugated forms of words, and hierarchical POS tags, were used in 219 Corpus Number Number of Words (Unknown Word Rate for Segmentation/Tagging) (Lang.) of POS [partition in the corpus] Tags Training Test CTB 34 84,937 7,980 (0.0764 / 0.0939) (C) [sec. 1–27</context>

There are also two other methods capable of conducting unknown word POS tagging (Ng and Low, 2004): Word-based Post-Processing Method This method receives results of word segmentation and known word POS tagging, and predicts POS tags of unknown words using words as units (Figure 2, B). This approach is the same as the approach widely used in English POS tagging. In the method, the process of unknown word POS tagging is separated from word segmentation and known word POS tagging, and information of parts-of-speech of unknown words cannot be used for word segmentation. In later experiments, maximum entropy models were used deterministically to predict POS tags of unknown words. As features f</context>

Character-based Post-Processing Method This method is similar to the word-based postprocessing method, but in this method, POS tags of unknown words are predicted using characters as units (Figure 2, C). In the method, POS tags of unknown words are predicted using exactly the same probabilistic models as the hybrid method, but word boundaries and POS tags of known words are fixed in the postprocessing step. Ng and Low (2004) studied Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging. They compared several approaches, and showed that character-based approaches had higher accuracy than word-based approaches, and that conducting word segmentation and POS tagging all at once performed better than conducting these processing separately. Our hybrid method is similar to their character-based all-atonce approach. However, in their experiments, only word-based and character-based methods were examined. In our experiments, the combined method of word-based and character-based processing was examined. Furthermore, although their exp</context>

In the table, Wordbased Post-Proc., Char.-based Post-Proc. and Hybrid Method respectively indicate results obtained with the word-based post-processing method, the character-based post-processing method, and the hybrid method. Two types of performance were measured: performance of word segmentation alone, and performance of both word segmentation and POS tagging. We first compare performance of both word segmentation and POS tagging. The F-measures of the hybrid method were highest on all the corpora. This result agrees with the observation by Ng and Low (2004) that higher accuracy was obtained by conducting word segmentation and POS tagging at the same time than by conducting these processing separately. Comparing the word-based and the character-based post-processing methods, the F-measures of the latter were higher on the Chinese corpora as reported by Ng and Low (2004), but the F-measures of the former were slightly higher on the Japanese corpora. The same tendency existed in the recalls for known words; the recalls of the character-based post-processing method were highest on the Chinese corpora, but 2The recalls for known words of the word-bas</context>

Nakagawa (2004) studied a method which combines a word-based method and a character-based method. Given an input sentence in the method, a lattice is constructed first using a word dictionary, which consists of word-level nodes for all the known words in the sentence. These nodes have POS tags. Then, character-level nodes for all the characters in the sentence are added into the lattice (Figure 1). These nodes have position-of-character (POC) tags which indicate word-internal positions of the characters (Xue, 2003). There are four POC tags, B, I, E and S, each of which respectively indicates the beginning of a word, the middle of a word, the end of a word, and a single character word. In the method, the word-level nodes are used to identify known words, and the character-level nodes are used to identify unknown words, because generally wordlevel information is precise and appropriate for processing known words, and character-level information is robust and appropriate for processing unknown words. Extended hidden Markov models are used to choose the best path among all the possible candidates in the lat</context>
