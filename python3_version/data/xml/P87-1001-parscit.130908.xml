ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999673363636364">
A semantics of linguistic categories like tense, aspect, and cer-
tain temporal adverbials, and a theory of their use in defining
the temporal relations of events, both require a more complex
structure on the domain underlying the meaning representa-
tions than is commonly assumed. The paper proposes an
ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence,
rather than on purely temporal primitives. We claim that any
manageable logic or other formal system for natural language
temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology,
as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about
events which is to be interrogated using natural language.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950555555555">
It has usually been assumed that the semantics of temporal
expressions is directly related to the linear dimensional con-
ception of time familiar from high-school physics — that is, to
a model based on the number-line. However, there are good
reasons for suspecting that such a conception is not the one
that our linguistic categories are most directly related to.
When-clauses provide an example of the mismatch between
linguistic temporal categories and a semantics based on such
an assumption. Consider the following examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.952535">
(1) When they built the 39th Street bridge...
(a) ...a local architect drew up the plans.
(b) ...they used the best materials.
(c) ...they solved most of their traffic problems.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995289911764706">
To map the temporal relations expressed in these examples
onto linear time, and to try to express the semantics of when in
terms of points or intervals (possibly associated with events),
would appear to imply either that when is multiply ambiguous,
allowing these points or intervals to be temporally related in at
least three different ways, or that the relation expressed
between main and when-clauses is one of &amp;quot;approximate coin-
cidence&amp;quot;. However, neither of these tactics explains the pecu-
liarity of utterances like the following:
(2) #When my car broke down, the sun set.
The oddity of this statement seems to arise because the when-
clause predicates something more than mere temporal coin-
cidence, that is, some contingent relation such as a causal link
between the two events. Of course, our knowledge of the
world does not easily support such a link. This aspect of the
sentence&apos;s meaning must stem from the sense-meaning of
when, because parallel utterances using just after, at approxi-
mately the same time as, and the like, which predicate purely
temporal coincidence, are perfectly felicitous.
We shall claim that the different temporal relations conveyed
in examples (1) do not arise from any sense-ambiguity of
when, or from any &amp;quot;fuzziness&amp;quot; in the relation that it expresses
between the times refered to in the clauses it conjoins, but from
the fact that the meaning of when is not primarily temporal at
all. We shall argue that when has single sense-meaning
reflecting its role of establishing a temporal focus. The
apparent diversity of meanings arises from the nature of this
referent and the organisation of events and states of affairs in
episodic memory under a relation we shall call &amp;quot;contingency&amp;quot;,
a term related to such notions as causality, rather than temporal
sequentiality. This contingent, non-temporal relation also
determines the ontology of the elementary propositions denot-
ing events and states of which episodic memory is composed,
and it is to these that we turn first.

2. Temporal and Aspectual Categories
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932023102564103">
Utterances of English sentences can, following Vendler, be
classified into temporal/aspectual types on the basis of the
tenses, aspects and adverbials with which they can cooccur (cf.
Dowty, 1979). This &amp;quot;aspectual type&amp;quot; refers to the relation to
other happenings in the discourse that a speaker predicates of
the particular happening that their utterance describes. Thus an
utterance of Harry reached the top is usually typical of what
we will call a &amp;quot;culmination&amp;quot; -- informally, an event which the
speaker vicws as accompanied by a transition to a new state of
the world.&apos; This new state we will refer to as the &amp;quot;consequent
state&amp;quot; of the event. Harry hiccupped is not usually viewed by
speakers as leading to any specific change of state. It typifies
what we call &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; expressions, that is punctual events whose
consequences are not at issue.
Similarly, Harry climbed typifies what we will call for obvious
reasons a &amp;quot;process&amp;quot;: such utterances describe an event as
extended in time but not characterised by any particular con-
clusion or culmination. In contrast, Harry climbed to the top
typically describes a state of affairs that also extends in time
but that does have a particular culmination associated with it at
which a change of state takes place. We classify such an utter-
ance as a &amp;quot;culminated process&amp;quot;. Finally, Harry is at the top
typically describes a state.
Thus we can interpret Vendler as saying that a part of the
meaning of any utterance of a sentence is one of a small
number of temporal/aspectual profiles distinguished on a small
number of dimensions. They can be summarized as in Figure
1.
It is important to be clear that this claim concerns sentences
used in a context: sense-meanings of sentences or verbs in iso-
lation are usually compatible with several (or even all possible)
Vencilerian profiles, as Dowty and Verlcuyl have pointed out —
hence the frequent use of the word &amp;quot;typically&amp;quot; above. The
details of this taxonomy and the criteria according to which
utterances can be categorised are therefore less important than
1 Readers familiar with Vendler&apos;s work will realise that we
have changed his terminology. We have done so both for notational
convenience and to avoid the considerable confusion that has arisen
concerning the precise meaning of the old terms.

the observation that each primitive entity of a given type, such
as the culmination-event of Harry&apos;s reaching the top, carries
intimations of other associated events and states, such as the
process by which the culmination was achieved, and the conse-
quent state that followed. What linguistic devices like tenses,
aspects, and temporal/aspectual adverbials appear to do is to
transform entities of one type into these other &amp;quot;contingently&amp;quot;
related entities, or to turn them into composites with those
related entities.
The temporal/aspectual ontology that underlies these
phenomena can be defined in terms of the state-transition net-
work shown in Figure 2. The semantics of tenses, aspectual
auxiliaries and temporal adverbials is defined in terms of func-
tions which map categories onto other categories, and having
the important characteristic of &amp;quot;coercing&amp;quot; their argument to be
of the appropriate type. Both the possibilities for coercing an
input proposition, and the possibilities for the output category,
are defined by the transition net. In addition, the felicity of a
particular transition is conditional on support from knowledge
and context.
Consider, for example, the combination of a culminated pro-
cess expression with afor-adverbial, as in
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.881817">
(3) Sue played the sonata for a few minutes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775">
A for-adverbial coerces its input to be of the process variety.
According to the network in Figure 2, such a transition is feli-
citous if the culmination point associated with the event of
playing the sonata is &amp;quot;stripped off&apos;. As a result, there is no
implication in (3) that Sue finished playing the sonata.
Another route through the network is possible in order to
account for examples with for-adverbials: the culminated pro-
cess, like any other event, can be viewed as an unstructured
&amp;quot;point&amp;quot;. A transition to turn it into a process then results in an
iteration of occurrences at which Sue plays the sonata. This
route through the network seems to be ruled out for
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98414575">
(3) because it finds no support in our knowledge about sonatas
and about how long they typically last. It does result, however,
in a likely interpretation for a sentence like
(4) Sue played the sonata for about eight hours.

Not all aspectual/temporal adverbials expressing a time span
have the same functional type. /n-adverbials, for example,
coerce their input to be a culminated process expression. This
means that combination with a culmination expression requires
the transition to be made to the culminated process node.
According to the aspectual network in Figure 2 this transition
is a felicitous one if the context allows a preparatory process to
be associated with the culmination, as in (5):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.754502">
(5) Laura reached the top in two hours.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998636833333333">
The in-adverbial then defines the length of this preparatory
period.
Since the arcs describe what the world has to be like for transi-
tions to be made felicitously, it is obvious that there are expres-
sions that will resist certain changes. For example, it will be
hard to find a context in which an in-adverbial can be com-
bined with a culmination expression like Harry accidentally
spilled his coffee, since it is hard to imagine a context in which
a preparatory process can be associated with an involuntary
act.
A similar problem arises in connection with the following
example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.79842">
(6) John ran in a few minutes
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997375">
The process expression John ran has to be changed into a cul-
minated process expression before combination with the in-
adverbial is possible. One way in which the network in Figure
2 will permit the change from a process to a culminated pro-
cess is if the context allows a culmination point to be associ-
ated with the process itself. General world knowledge makes
this rather hard for a sentence like John ran, except in the case
where John habitually runs a particular distance, such as a
measured mile. If the in-adverbial had conveyed a specific
duration, such as in four minutes, then the analysis would make
sense, as Dowty has pointed out. However, the unspecific in a
few minutes continues to resist this interpretation.
However, another route is also possible for (6): the process of
John running can be made into an atomic point, and thence
into a culmination in its own right. This culmination can then
acquire a preparatory process of its own -- which we can think
of as preparing to run -- to become the culminated process
which the adverbial requires. This time, there is no conflict
with the content of the adverbial, so this reading is the most
accessible of the two.
Progressive auxiliaries coerce their input to be a process
expression. The result of the application is a progressive state,
which describes the process as being in progress. This means
that, when a culmination expression like reach the top is used
with a progressive, a transition path has to be found from the
culmination node to the process node. According to the transi-
tion network, this involves first adding a preparatory process to
the culmination, and then stripping off the culmination point.
As a result, the progressive sentence only describes the
preparation as ongoing and no longer asserts that the original
culmination even occurred. There would be no contradiction
in continuing

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990197345454546">
As Mows &amp; Steedman (1986) point out, the fact that accord-
ing to the present theory, progressives coerce their input to be a
process, so that any associated culmination is stripped away
and no longer contributes to truth conditions, provides a reso-
lution of the &amp;quot;imperfective paradox&amp;quot; (Dowty 1979), without
appealing to theory-external constructs like &amp;quot;inertia worlds&amp;quot;.
A perfect, as in
(9) Harry has reached the top
refers to the consequent state of the culmination. It requires its
input category to be either a culmination or a culminated pro-
cess, and maps this expression into its consequent state. Infor-
mal evidence that it does so can be obtained by noticing that
perfects are infelicitous if the salient consequences are not in
force. The most obvious of these consequences for (9) is that
Harry still be at the top, although as usual there are other possi-
bilities.
Since the transition network includes loops, it will allow us to
define indefinitely complex temporal/aspectual categories, like
the one evoked by the following sentence:
(10) It took me two days to play the &amp;quot;Minute Waltz&amp;quot;
in less than sixty seconds for more than an hour.
The culminated process expression play the Minute Waltz can
combine straightforwardly with the in-adverbial, indicating
how long it takes to reach the culmination point of finishing
playing the Minute Waltz. Combination with the for-adverbial
requires this expression to be turned into a process - the most
obvious route through the network being that through the point
node. The resulting culminated process expression describes
the iterated process of playing the Minute Waltz in less than
sixty seconds as lasting for more than an hour. The expression
it took me..., finally, is like an in-adverbial in that it is looking
for a culminated process expression to combine with. It finds
one in the expression to play the Minute Waltz in less than
sixty seconds for more than an hour but combination is ham-
pered by the fact that there is a conflict in the length of time the
adverbials describe. In the case of (10), the whole culminated
process is instead viewed as a culmination in its own right (via
the path through the point node). Knowledge concerning such
musical feats then supplies an appropriate preparatory process
which we can think of as practicising. The adverbial it took
me two days then defines the temporal extent of this prepara-
tory process needed to reach the point at which repeatedly
playing that piece of music so fast for such a considerable
length of time became a newly acquired skill.
This basic framework thus allows for a unified semantics of a
wide variety of aspectual adverbials, the progressive, the per-
fect, and iterative expressions in English. It is also used to
explain the effect of bare plurals and certain varieties of nega-
tion on the overall temporal structure of discourse (Moens
forthcoming).
All of the permissible transitions between aspectual categories
illustrated in Figure 2 appear to be related to a single elemen-
tary contingency-based event structure which we call a
&amp;quot;nucleus&amp;quot;. A nucleus is defined as a structure comprising a
culmination, an associated preparatory process, and a conse-

quern state. It can be represented pictorially as in Figure 3.2
preparatory process consequent state
culmination
Figure 3
Any or all of these elements may be compound: the prepara-
tion may consist of a number of discrete steps, for example the
stages of climbing, having lunch or whatever, leading to the
culmination of reaching the top. The consequent state may
also be compound. Most importantly, we shall see that it
includes the further events, if any, that are in the same
sequence of contingently related events as the culmination.
Similarly, the culmination may itself be a complex event —
such as the entire culminated process of climbing a mountain.
(In this case, the associated preparatory process and conse-
quent state will be quite different ones to those internal to the
culminated process itself.) The device is intended to embody
the proposal that when we hear about an event like climbing a
mountain in conjunction with some coercive aspectual
category which forces it to undergo a transition, then the alter-
natives that are available are:
a) to decompose the core event into a nucleus and to make
a transition to one of the components, such as the
preparatory activity of climbing or to the consequent
state of having climbed the mountain; or
b) to treat the entire event as a culmination, to compose it
into a nucleus with whatever preparation and conse-
quences the context provides for the activity of climbing
a mountain, and to make the transition to either one of
those.
We further claim that those are the only alternatives.
The concept of a nucleus not only explains the transitions of
Figure 2, but also provides an answer to the question raised in
the introduction concerning the apparent vagaries in the mean-
ing of when-clauses.

<bodyText confidence="0.998960823529412">
The aspects and temporal/aspectual adverbials considered
above all act to modify or change the aspectual class of the
core proposition, subject to the limits imposed by the network
in Figure 2, which we claim is in turn determined by the organ-
isation of episodic memory. However, tenses and certain
other varieties of adverbial adjuncts have a rather different
character. Tense is widely regarded as an anaphoric category,
requiring a previously established temporal referent. The
referent for a present tense is usually the time of speech, but
the referent for a past tense must be explicitly established.
Such a referent is usually established using a second type of
&amp;quot;temporal&amp;quot; adverbial, such as once upon a time, at five o&apos;clock
last Saturday, while I was cleaning my teeth, or when I woke
up this morning.
Most accounts of the anaphoric nature of tense have invoked
Reichenbach&apos;s (1947) trinity of underlying times, and his con-
cept of the &amp;quot;positional&amp;quot; use of the reference time which he

A similar event structure is proposed by Passonneau (l987).
called &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;. Under these accounts (reviewed in Steedman,
1982), the adjuncts establish a reference time to which the
reference time of a main clause and subsequent same-tensed
clauses may attach or refer, in much the same way that various
species of full noun phrases establish referents for pronouns.
However, in one respect, the past tense does not behave like a
pronoun. Use of a pronoun such as &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; does not change the
referent to which a subsequent use of the same pronoun may
refer, whereas using a past tense may. In the following exam-
ple, the temporal reference point for sentence (b) seems to
have moved on from the time established by the adjunct in (a):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99171">
(11) a. At exactly five o&apos;clock, Harry walked in.
b. He sat down.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984910432432433">
This fact has caused theorists such as Dowty (1986), Hinrichs
(1984) and Partee (1984) to stipulate that the reference time
autonomously advances during a narrative. However, such a
stipulation (besides creating problems for the theory vis-d-vis
those narratives where reference time seems not to advance)
seems to be unnecessary, since the amount by which it
advances still has to be determined by context. The concept of
a nucleus that was invoked above to explain the varieties of
aspectual categories offers us exactly what we need to explain
both the fact of the advance and its extent. We simply need to
assume that a main clause event such as Harry walked in is
interpreted as an entire nucleus, complete with consequent
state, for by definition the consequent state includes whatever
other events were contingent upon Harry walking in, including
whatever he did next. Provided that the context (or the
hearer&apos;s assumptions about the world) supports the idea that a
subsequent main clause identifies this next contingent event,
then it will provide the temporal referent for that main clause.
In its ability to refer to entities that have not been explicitly
mentioned, but whose existence has merely been implied by
the presence of an entity that has been mentioned, tense
appears more like a definite NP like the music in the following
example than like a pronoun, as Webber (1987) points out.
(12) I went to a party last night. The music was wonderful.
A similar move is all that is required to explain the puzzle con-
cerning the apparent ambiguity of when-clauses with which the
paper began. A when-clause behaves rather like one of those
phrases that are used to explicitly change topic, like and your
father in the following example from Isard, (1975):
(13) And your father, how is he?
A when-clause introduces a novel temporal referent into focus
whose unique identifiability in the hearer&apos;s memory is simi-
larly presupposed. However, again the focussed temporal
referent is an entire nucleus, and again an event main clause
can attach itself anywhere within this structure that world
knowledge will allow. For example, consider the example (1)
with which we began (repeated here):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983291">
(14) When they built the 39th Street bridge...
(a) ...a local architect drew up the plans.
(b) ...they used the best materials.
(c) ...they solved most of their traffic problems.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999426">
Once the core event of the when-clause has been identified in
memory, the hearer has the same two alternatives described
before: either it is decomposed into a preparatory process, a
culmination and a consequent state, or the entire event is
treated as itself the culmination of another nucleus. Either
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.993563555555556">
way, once the nucleus is established, the reference time of the
main clause has to be situated somewhere within it - the exact
location being determined by knowledge of the entities
involved and the episode in question. So in example (a) the
entire culminated process of building the bridge becomes a
culmination (via a path in Figure 2 which passes through the
&amp;quot;point&amp;quot; node) which is associated in a nucleus with prepara-
tions for, and consequences of, the entire business, as in Figure
4:

<figureCaption confidence="0.99686">

<bodyText confidence="0.998845222222222">
The drawing up of the plans is then, for reasons to do with
knowledge of the world, situated in the preparatory phase.
In example (b), in contrast, the building of the bridge is
decomposed into a quite different preparatory process of build-
ing, a quite different culmination of completing the bridge and
some consequences which we take to be also subtly distinct
from those in the previous case, as in Figure 5. The use of the
best materials is then, as in (a), situated in the preparatory pro-
cess — but it is a different one this time.

Example (c) is like (a) in giving rise to the nucleus in Figure 4,
but pragmatics demands that the main clause be situated some-
where in the consequent state of building the bridge.
Thus, a main clause event can potentially be situated anywhere
along this nucleus, subject to support from knowledge about
the precise events involved, But example (2) is still strange,
because it is so hard to think of any relation that is supported in
this way:
(15) #When my car broke down, the sun set.
The when-clause defines a nucleus, consisting of whatever pro-
cess we can think of as leading up to the car&apos;s break-down, the
break-down itself and its possible or actual consequences. It is
not clear where along this nucleus the culmination of the sun
set could be situated: it is not easy to imagine that it is a func-
tional part of the preparatory process typically associated with
a break-down, and it is similarly hard to imagine that it can be
a part of the consequent state, so under most imaginable cir-
cumstances, the utterance remains bizarre.
The constraints when places on possible interpretations of the
relation between subordinate and main clause are therefore
quite strong. First, general and specific knowledge about the
event described in the when-clause has to support the associa-
tion of a complete nucleus with it. Secondly, world knowledge
also has to support the contingency relation between the events
in subordinate and main clause. As a result, many constructed
examples sound strange or are considered to be infelicitous,
because too much context has to be imported to make sense of
them.
In all of the cases discussed so far, the main clause has been an
event of some variety. When the main clause is stative, as in
the following examples, the effect is much the same. That is to
say, the when-clause establishes a nucleus, and the stative is
asserted or attached wherever world knowledge permits within
the nucleus. The only difference is that statives are by
definition unbounded with respect to the reference time that
they are predicated of, and outlast it. It follows that they can
usually fit in almost anywhere, and therefore tend not to coerce
the when-clause, or to induce the causal/contingent interpreta-
tions that we claim characterise the corresponding sentences
with events as main clauses:
(16) When they built that bridge
...I was still a young lad.
...my grandfather had been dead for several years.
...my aunt was having an affair with the milkman.
...my father used to play squash.
However, world knowledge may on occasion constrain the
relation of a stative main clause, and force it to attach to or
describe a situation holding over either the preparatory process
or the consequent state of the subordinate clause, as in the fol-
lowing examples (cf. Smith 1983):
(17) When Harry broke Sue&apos;s vase,
...she was in a good mood.
..she was in a bad mood.

4. Towards a Formai Representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980172413793">
We have argued in this paper that a principled and unified
semantics of natural language categories like tense, aspect and
aspectual/temporal adverbials requires an ontology based on
contingency rather than temporality. The notion of &amp;quot;nucleus&amp;quot;
plays a crucial role in this ontology. The process of temporal
reference involves reference to the appropriate part of a
nucleus, where appropriateness is a function of the inherent
meaning of the core expression, of the coercive nature of co-
occurring linguistic expressions, and of particular and general
knowledge about the area of discourse.
The identification of the correct ontology is also a vital prelim-
inary to the construction and management of temporal data-
bases. Effective exchange of information between people and
machines is easier if the data structures that are used to organ-
ise the information in the machine correspond in a natural way
to the conceptual structures people use to organize the same
information. In fact, the penalties for a bad fit between data-
structures and human concepts are usually crippling for any
attempt to provide natural language interfaces for data base
systems. Information extracted from natural language text can
only be stored to the extent that it fits the preconceived for-
mats, usually resulting in loss of information. Conversely,
such data structures cannot easily be queried using natural
language if there is a bad fit between the conceptual structure
implicit in the query and the conceptual structure of the data-
base.
The &amp;quot;contingency-based&amp;quot; ontology that we are advocating here
has a number of implications for the construction and manage-
ment of such temporal databases. Rather than a homogeneous

database of dated points or intervals, we should partition it into
distinct sequences of causally or otherwise contingently related
sequences of events which we will call &amp;quot;episodes&amp;quot;, each lead-
ing to the satisfaction of a particular goal or intention. This
partition will quite incidentally define a partial temporal order-
ing on the events, but the primary purpose of such sequences is
more related to the notion of a plan of action or an explanation
of an event&apos;s occurrence than to anything to do with time itself.
It follows that only events that are contingently related neces-
sarily have well defined temporal relations in memory.
A first attempt to investigate this kind of system was reported
by Steedman (1982), using a program that verified queries
against a database structured according to some of the princi-
ples outlined above. These principles can be described using
Kowalsid&apos;s event-calculus (Kowalski &amp; Sergot 1986). In this
framework, there are primitives called events, the occurrence
of which usually implies the existence of periods of time over
which states hold. In the terms of the present paper, these
&amp;quot;events&amp;quot; are either &amp;quot;points&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;culminations&amp;quot; (depending on
whether they are in fact associated with consequent states —
see section 2). For example, in the world of academic promo-
tions which Kowalski and Sergot take as an example, an event
description like John was promoted from the rank of lecturer
to the rank of professor is a culmination which implies that
there was a period of time, ended by this event, during which
John had the rank of lecturer, and there is a period of time,
started by that same event, during which John had the rank of
professor.
The events in the event calculus are given unique identifiers,
but are not necessarily associated with absolute time. More-
over, they can be partially ordered with respect to each other,
or occur simultaneously. Events themselves may also be
described only partially; later information can be added when
it becomes available. These features, which they share with
the corresponding primitives in a number of other formalisms,
such as those of McDermott (1982), Allen (1984) and Lanslcy
(1986), all constitute an advance over temporal representation
formalisms based on the situation calculus (McCarthy &amp; Hayes
1969),
Although KowaLski&apos;s events are undecomposable points or
culminations, they can be used to describe extended events
such as our processes, in terms of a pair identifying their start-
ing point and to the point at which they stop (in the case of
processes) or their culmination (in the case of culminated
processes). This means that a process expression like John ran
will introduce two events, one indicating the start of the pro-
cess and one indicating the endpoint. Just like the point events
considered by Kowalski and Sergot, these events have certain
properties or states associated with them. The starting-point of
the process referred to by uttering John ran marks the begin-
ning of a progressive state that we refer to when we use a pro-
gressive like John is running, a state which is terminated by
the corresponding endpoint event.
This duality between events and states (which was also
exploited in Steedman, 1982), is very useful for representing
the kind of ontology that we have argued natural language
categories reflect. But one shortcoming of Kowalski&apos;s event
calculus is the absence of other than temporal relations
between the events. The best worked out event-based model
that takes into account causal as well as temporal relations is
Lanslcy&apos;s (1986). The representation she presents is based on
GEM (Lansicy &amp; Ovricki 1983), a tool for the specification and
verification of concurrent programs. GEM reifies events and
explicitly represents both their causal and temporal relations.
It also provides mechanisms for structuring events into so-
called locations of activity&amp;quot;, the boundaries on these locations
being boundaries of causal access - as in our episodes. In Lan-
sky (1986), the GEM tool is used to build event-based
knowledge representations for use in planners. She suggests
the use of three accessibility relations: temporal precedence
(&lt;), causality or contingency (@), and simultaneity ($).
These relations have the following properties:
&lt; : irreflexive, antisymmetric, transitive
@: irrefiexive, antisyrnmetric, intransitive
$ : reflexive, symmetric, transitive
Because we follow Lansky in making the
causality/contingency relation @ intransitive, we avoid certain
notorious problems in the treatment of when-clauses and per-
fects, which arise because the search for possible consequences
of an event has to be restricted to the first event on the chain of
contingencies. Thus, when (18a) and (b) are asserted, it would
be wrong to infer (c):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978418333333333">
(18) (a) When John left, Sue cried
(b) When Sue cried, her mother got upset
(c) When John left, Sue&apos;s mother got upset
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967071428572">
The reason is exactly the same as the reason that it would be
wrong to infer that Sue&apos;s mother got upset because John left,
and has nothing to do with the purely temporal relations of
these events. It should also be noted that the notion of causal-
ity or contingency used here (in line with Lansicy&apos;s proposals)
is weaker than that used in other representation schemes (for
example that of McDermott 1982) in that causality is here
decoupled from eventuality: if an event A stands in a causal
relation to event B, then an occurrence of A will not automati-
cally lead to an occurrence of B: John laying the foundations
of the house is a prerequisite for or enables him to build the
walls and roof but does not &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; it in the more traditional
sense of the word and doe§ not automatically or inevitably lead
to him building the walls.&amp;quot;

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934133333333">
Many of the apparent anomalies and ambiguities that plague
current semantic accounts of temporal expressions in natural
language stem from the assumption that a linear model of time
is the one that our linguistic categories are most directly related
to. A more principled semantics is possible on the assumption
that the temporal categories of tense, aspect, aspectual adverbi-
aLs and of propositions themselves refer to a mental representa-
tion of events that is structured on other than purely temporal
principles, and to which the notion of a nucleus or contingently
related sequence of preparatory process, goal event and conse-
quent state is central.
We see this claim as a logical preliminary to the choice of any
particular formal representation. However, certain properties
of the event-based calculi of Kowalski and Sergot, and of Lan-
sky, seem to offer an appropriate representation for a

<abstract confidence="0.997696083333333">A semantics of linguistic categories like tense, aspect, and certain temporal adverbials, and a theory of their use in defining the temporal relations of events, both require a more complex structure on the domain underlying the meaning representations than is commonly assumed. The paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. We claim that any manageable logic or other formal system for natural language temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.</abstract>

This contingent, non-temporal relation also determines the ontology of the elementary propositions denoting events and states of which episodic memory is composed, and it is to these that we turn first. 2. Temporal and Aspectual Categories Utterances of English sentences can, following Vendler, be classified into temporal/aspectual types on the basis of the tenses, aspects and adverbials with which they can cooccur (cf. Dowty, 1979). This &amp;quot;aspectual type&amp;quot; refers to the relation to other happenings in the discourse that a speaker predicates of the particular happening that their utterance describes. Thus an utterance of Harry reached the top is usually typical of what we will call a &amp;quot;culmination&amp;quot; -- informally, an event which the speaker vicws as accompanied by a transition to a new state of the world.&apos; This new state we will refer to as the &amp;quot;consequent state&amp;quot; of the event. Harry hiccupped is not usually viewed by speakers as leading to any specific change of state. It typifies what we call &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; expressions, that is pu</context>

As a result, the progressive sentence only describes the preparation as ongoing and no longer asserts that the original culmination even occurred. There would be no contradiction in continuing (7) Harry was reaching the top as in (8) Harry was reaching the top but he slipped and fell before he got there. As Mows &amp; Steedman (1986) point out, the fact that according to the present theory, progressives coerce their input to be a process, so that any associated culmination is stripped away and no longer contributes to truth conditions, provides a resolution of the &amp;quot;imperfective paradox&amp;quot; (Dowty 1979), without appealing to theory-external constructs like &amp;quot;inertia worlds&amp;quot;. A perfect, as in (9) Harry has reached the top refers to the consequent state of the culmination. It requires its input category to be either a culmination or a culminated process, and maps this expression into its consequent state. Informal evidence that it does so can be obtained by noticing that perfects are infelicitous if the salient consequences are not in force. The most obvious of these consequences for (9) is that Harry still be at the top, although as usual there are other possibilities. Since the transition net</context>

However, in one respect, the past tense does not behave like a pronoun. Use of a pronoun such as &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; does not change the referent to which a subsequent use of the same pronoun may refer, whereas using a past tense may. In the following example, the temporal reference point for sentence (b) seems to have moved on from the time established by the adjunct in (a): (11) a. At exactly five o&apos;clock, Harry walked in. b. He sat down. This fact has caused theorists such as Dowty (1986), Hinrichs (1984) and Partee (1984) to stipulate that the reference time autonomously advances during a narrative. However, such a stipulation (besides creating problems for the theory vis-d-vis those narratives where reference time seems not to advance) seems to be unnecessary, since the amount by which it advances still has to be determined by context. The concept of a nucleus that was invoked above to explain the varieties of aspectual categories offers us exactly what we need to explain both the fact of the advance and its extent. We simply need to assume that a main clause event such as H</context>

A when-clause behaves rather like one of those phrases that are used to explicitly change topic, like and your father in the following example from Isard, (1975): (13) And your father, how is he? A when-clause introduces a novel temporal referent into focus whose unique identifiability in the hearer&apos;s memory is similarly presupposed. However, again the focussed temporal referent is an entire nucleus, and again an event main clause can attach itself anywhere within this structure that world knowledge will allow.

Thus, when (18a) and (b) are asserted, it would be wrong to infer (c): (18) (a) When John left, Sue cried (b) When Sue cried, her mother got upset (c) When John left, Sue&apos;s mother got upset The reason is exactly the same as the reason that it would be wrong to infer that Sue&apos;s mother got upset because John left, and has nothing to do with the purely temporal relations of these events. It should also be noted that the notion of causality or contingency used here (in line with Lansicy&apos;s proposals) is weaker than that used in other representation schemes (for example that of McDermott 1982) in that causality is here decoupled from eventuality: if an event A stands in a causal relation to event B, then an occurrence of A will not automatically lead to an occurrence of B: John laying the foundations of the house is a prerequisite for or enables him to build the walls and roof but does not &amp;quot;cause&amp;quot; it in the more traditional sense of the word and doe§ not automatically or inevitably lead to him building the walls.&amp;quot; 5.

However, in one respect, the past tense does not behave like a pronoun. Use of a pronoun such as &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; does not change the referent to which a subsequent use of the same pronoun may refer, whereas using a past tense may. In the following example, the temporal reference point for sentence (b) seems to have moved on from the time established by the adjunct in (a): (11) a. At exactly five o&apos;clock, Harry walked in. b. He sat down. This fact has caused theorists such as Dowty (1986), Hinrichs (1984) and Partee (1984) to stipulate that the reference time autonomously advances during a narrative. However, such a stipulation (besides creating problems for the theory vis-d-vis those narratives where reference time seems not to advance) seems to be unnecessary, since the amount by which it advances still has to be determined by context. The concept of a nucleus that was invoked above to explain the varieties of aspectual categories offers us exactly what we need to explain both the fact of the advance and its extent. We simply need to assume that a main clause event such as Harry walked in is interpreted as an</context>

However, world knowledge may on occasion constrain the relation of a stative main clause, and force it to attach to or describe a situation holding over either the preparatory process or the consequent state of the subordinate clause, as in the following examples (cf. Smith 1983): (17) When Harry broke Sue&apos;s vase, ...she was in a good mood. ..she was in a bad mood. 4. Towards a Formai Representation We have argued in this paper that a principled and unified semantics of natural language categories like tense, aspect and aspectual/temporal adverbials requires an ontology based on contingency rather than temporality. The notion of &amp;quot;nucleus&amp;quot; plays a crucial role in this ontology. The process of temporal reference involves reference to the appropriate part of a nucleus, where appropriateness is a function of the inherent meaning of the core expression, of the coercive nat</context>

Such a referent is usually established using a second type of &amp;quot;temporal&amp;quot; adverbial, such as once upon a time, at five o&apos;clock last Saturday, while I was cleaning my teeth, or when I woke up this morning. Most accounts of the anaphoric nature of tense have invoked Reichenbach&apos;s (1947) trinity of underlying times, and his concept of the &amp;quot;positional&amp;quot; use of the reference time which he 2 A similar event structure is proposed by Passonneau (l987). called &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;. Under these accounts (reviewed in Steedman, 1982), the adjuncts establish a reference time to which the reference time of a main clause and subsequent same-tensed clauses may attach or refer, in much the same way that various species of full noun phrases establish referents for pronouns. However, in one respect, the past tense does not behave like a pronoun. Use of a pronoun such as &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; does not change the referent to which a subsequent use of the same pronoun may refer, whereas using a past tense may.

This partition will quite incidentally define a partial temporal ordering on the events, but the primary purpose of such sequences is more related to the notion of a plan of action or an explanation of an event&apos;s occurrence than to anything to do with time itself. It follows that only events that are contingently related necessarily have well defined temporal relations in memory. A first attempt to investigate this kind of system was reported by Steedman (1982), using a program that verified queries against a database structured according to some of the principles outlined above. These principles can be described using Kowalsid&apos;s event-calculus (Kowalski &amp; Sergot 1986). In this framework, there are primitives called events, the occurrence of which usually implies the existence of periods of time over which states hold. In the terms of the present paper, these &amp;quot;events&amp;quot; are either &amp;quot;points&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;culminations&amp;quot; (depending on whether they are in fact associated with consequent states — see section 2). For example, in the world of academic promotions which </context>

This means that a process expression like John ran will introduce two events, one indicating the start of the process and one indicating the endpoint. Just like the point events considered by Kowalski and Sergot, these events have certain properties or states associated with them. The starting-point of the process referred to by uttering John ran marks the beginning of a progressive state that we refer to when we use a progressive like John is running, a state which is terminated by the corresponding endpoint event. This duality between events and states (which was also exploited in Steedman, 1982), is very useful for representing the kind of ontology that we have argued natural language categories reflect. But one shortcoming of Kowalski&apos;s event calculus is the absence of other than temporal relations between the events. The best worked out event-based model that takes into account causal as well as temporal relations is Lanslcy&apos;s (1986). The representation she presents is based on GEM (Lansicy &amp; Ovricki 1983), a tool for the specification and verification of concurrent programs. GEM reifies events and explicitly represents both their causal and temporal relations. It also provides mec</context>

Provided that the context (or the hearer&apos;s assumptions about the world) supports the idea that a subsequent main clause identifies this next contingent event, then it will provide the temporal referent for that main clause. In its ability to refer to entities that have not been explicitly mentioned, but whose existence has merely been implied by the presence of an entity that has been mentioned, tense appears more like a definite NP like the music in the following example than like a pronoun, as Webber (1987) points out. (12) I went to a party last night. The music was wonderful. A similar move is all that is required to explain the puzzle concerning the apparent ambiguity of when-clauses with which the paper began. A when-clause behaves rather like one of those phrases that are used to explicitly change topic, like and your father in the following example from Isard, (1975): (13) And your father, how is he? A when-clause introduces a novel temporal referent into focus whose unique identifiability in the hearer&apos;s memory is similarly presupposed. However, again the focussed temporal referent is an </context>
