Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998416875">
We describe the Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter task, ran as part of SemEval-2014.
It is a continuation of the last year’s task
that ran successfully as part of SemEval-
2013. As in 2013, this was the most popu-
lar SemEval task; a total of 46 teams con-
tributed 27 submissions for subtask A (21
teams) and 50 submissions for subtask B
(44 teams). This year, we introduced three
new test sets: (i) regular tweets, (ii) sarcas-
tic tweets, and (iii) LiveJournal sentences.
We further tested on (iv) 2013 tweets, and
(v) 2013 SMS messages. The highest F1-
score on (i) was achieved by NRC-Canada
at 86.63 for subtask A and by TeamX at
70.96 for subtask B.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983111111111">
In the past decade, new forms of communica-
tion have emerged and have become ubiquitous
through social media. Microblogs (e.g., Twitter),
Weblogs (e.g., LiveJournal) and cell phonemes-
sages (SMS) are often used to share opinions and
sentiments about the surrounding world, and the
availability of social content generated on sites
such as Twitter creates new opportunities to au-
tomatically study public opinion.
Working with these informal text genres
presents new challenges for natural language pro-
cessing beyond those encountered when work-
ing with more traditional text genres such as
newswire. The language in social media is very
informal, with creative spelling and punctuation,
misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-
specific terminology and abbreviations, e.g., RT
for re-tweet and #hashtags1.

Moreover, tweets and SMS messages are short:
a sentence or a headline rather than a document.
How to handle such challenges so as to automat-
ically mine and understand people’s opinions and
sentiments has only recently been the subject of
research (Jansen et al., 2009; Barbosa and Feng,
2010; Bifet et al., 2011; Davidov et al., 2010;
O’Connor et al., 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010;
Tumasjan et al., 2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011).
Several corpora with detailed opinion and sen-
timent annotation have been made freely avail-
able, e.g., the MPQA newswire corpus (Wiebe et
al., 2005), the movie reviews corpus (Pang et al.,
2002), or the restaurant and laptop reviews cor-
pora that are part of this year’s SemEval Task 4
(Pontiki et al., 2014). These corpora have proved
very valuable as resources for learning about the
language of sentiment in general, but they do not
focus on tweets. While some Twitter sentiment
datasets were created prior to SemEval-2013, they
were either small and proprietary, such as the i-
sieve corpus (Kouloumpis et al., 2011) or focused
solely on message-level sentiment.
Thus, the primary goal of our SemEval task is
to promote research that will lead to better un-
derstanding of how sentiment is conveyed in So-
cial Media. Toward that goal, we created the Se-
mEval Tweet corpus as part of our inaugural Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter Task, SemEval-2013
Task 2 (Nakov et al., 2013). It contains tweets
and SMS messages with sentiment expressions an-
notated with contextual phrase-level and message-
level polarity. This year, we extended the corpus
by adding new tweets and LiveJournal sentences.
Another interesting phenomenon that has been
studied in Twitter is the use of the #sarcasm hash-
tag to indicate that a tweet should not be taken lit-
erally (Gonz´alez-Ib´a˜nez et al., 2011; Liebrecht et
al., 2013). In fact, sarcasm indicates that the mes-
sage polarity should be flipped. With this in mind,
this year, we also evaluate on sarcastic tweets.

2 Task Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998458">
As SemEval-2013 Task 2, we included two sub-
tasks: an expression-level subtask and a message-
level subtask. Participants could choose to partici-
pate in either or both. Below we provide short de-
scriptions of the objectives of these two subtasks.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.771416">
Subtask A: Contextual Polarity Disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98432053125">
Given a message containing a marked in-
stance of a word or a phrase, determine
whether that instance is positive, negative or
neutral in that context. The instance bound-
aries were provided: this was a classification
task, not an entity recognition task.
Subtask B: Message Polarity Classification
Given a message, decide whether it is of
positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
For messages conveying both positive and
negative sentiment, the stronger one is to be
chosen.
Each participating team was allowed to submit
results for two different systems per subtask: one
constrained, and one unconstrained. A constrained
system could only use the provided data for train-
ing, but it could also use other resources such as
lexicons obtained elsewhere. An unconstrained
system could use any additional data as part of
the training process; this could be done in a super-
vised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised fashion.
Note that constrained/unconstrained refers to
the data used to train a classifier. For example,
if other data (excluding the test data) was used to
develop a sentiment lexicon, and the lexicon was
used to generate features, the system would still
be constrained. However, if other data (excluding
the test data) was used to develop a sentiment lexi-
con, and this lexicon was used to automatically la-
bel additional Tweet/SMS messages and then used
with the original data to train the classifier, then
such a system would be considered unconstrained.

<bodyText confidence="0.999926769230769">
For training and development, we released the
Twitter train/dev/test datasets from SemEval-2013
task 2, as well as the SMS test set, which uses mes-
sages from the NUS SMS corpus (Chen and Kan,
2013), which we annotated for sentiment in 2013.
We further added a new 2014 Twitter test set,
as well as a small set of tweets that contained
the #sarcasm hashtag to determine how sarcasm
affects the tweet polarity. Finally, we included
sentences from LiveJournal in order to determine
how systems trained on Twitter perform on other
sources. The statistics for each dataset and for
each subtask are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

3.2 Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990866666667">
We annotated the new tweets as in 2013: by iden-
tifying tweets from popular topics that contain
sentiment-bearing words by using SentiWordNet
(Baccianella et al., 2010) as a filter. We altered the
annotation task for the sarcastic tweets, displaying
them to the Mechanical Turk annotators without
the #sarcasm hashtag; the Turkers had to deter-
mine whether the tweet is sarcastic on their own.
Moreover, we asked Turkers to indicate the degree
of sarcasm as (a) definitely sarcastic, (b) probably
sarcastic, and (c) not sarcastic.
As in 2013, we combined the annotations using
intersection, where a word had to appear in 2/3
of the annotations to be accepted. An annotated
example from each source is shown in Table 3.

3.3 Tweets Delivery
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975">
We did not deliver the annotated tweets to the par-
ticipants directly; instead, we released annotation
indexes, a list of corresponding Twitter IDs, and
a download script that extracts the correspond-
ing tweets via the Twitter API.2 We provided the
tweets in this manner in order to ensure that Twit-
ter’s terms of service are not violated. Unfor-
tunately, due to this restriction, the task partici-
pants had access to different number of training
tweets depending on when they did the download-
ing. This varied between a minimum of 5,215
tweets and the full set of 10,882 tweets. On av-
erage the teams were able to collect close to 9,000
tweets; for teams that did not participate in 2013,
this was about 8,500. The difference in training
data size did not seem to have had a major impact.
In fact, the top two teams in subtask B (coooolll
and TeamX) trained on less than 8,500 tweets.

4 Scoring
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9528189">
The participating systems were required to per-
form a three-way classification for both subtasks.
A particular marked phrase (for subtask A) or an
entire message (for subtask B) was to be classi-
fied as positive, negative or objective/neutral. We
scored the systems by computing a score for pre-
dicting positive/negative phrases/messages. For
instance, to compute positive precision, ppos, we
find the number of phrases/messages that a sys-
tem correctly predicted to be positive, and we di-
vide that number by the total number it predicted
to be positive. To compute positive recall, rpos,
we find the number of phrases/messages correctly
predicted to be positive and we divide that number
by the total number of positives in the gold stan-
dard. We then calculate F1-score for the positive
class as follows Fpos = 2(ppos∗rp,,s. We carry
pposos
out a similar computation for Fneg, for the nega-
tive phrases/messages. The overall score is then

F = (Fpos + Fneg)/2.

We used the two test sets from 2013 and the
three from 2014, which we combined into one test
set and we shuffled to make it hard to guess which
set a sentence came from. This guaranteed that
participants would submit predictions for all five
test sets. It also allowed us to test how well sys-
tems trained on standard tweets generalize to sar-
castic tweets and to LiveJournal sentences, with-
out the participants putting extra efforts into this.
The participants were also not informed about the
source the extra test sets come from.
We provided the participants with a scorer that
outputs the overall score F and a confusion matrix
for each of the five test sets.

5 Participants and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956153846154">
The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5, and the
team affiliations are shown in Table 6. Tables 4
and 5 contain results on the two progress test sets
(tweets and SMS messages), which are the official
test sets from the 2013 edition of the task, and on
the three new official 2014 testsets (tweets, tweets
with sarcasm, and LiveJournal). The tables fur-
ther show macro- and micro-averaged results over
the 2014 datasets. There is an index for each re-
sult showing the relative rank of that result within
the respective column. The participating systems
are ranked by their score on the Twitter-2014 test-
set, which is the official ranking for the task; all
remaining rankings are secondary.
As we mentioned above, the participants were
not told that the 2013 test sets would be included
in the big 2014 test set, so that they do not over-
tune their systems on them. However, the 2013
test sets were made available for development, but
it was explicitly forbidden to use them for training.
Still, some participants did not notice this restric-
tion, which resulted in their unusually high scores
on Twitter2013-test; we did our best to identify
all such cases, and we asked the authors to submit
corrected runs. The tables mark such resubmis-
sions accordingly.

Most of the submissions were constrained, with
just a few unconstrained: 7 out of 27 for subtask
A, and 8 out of 50 for subtask B. In any case, the
best systems were constrained. Some teams par-
ticipated with both a constrained and an uncon-
strained system, but the unconstrained system was
not always better than the constrained one: some-
times it was worse, sometimes it performed the
same. Thus, we decided to produce a single rank-
ing, including both constrained and unconstrained
systems, where we mark the latter accordingly.

seven unconstrained submissions: five teams sub-

participating systems outperformed the majority

sions: six teams submitted both a constrained and
an unconstrained run, and two teams submitted an
unconstrained run only. As for subtask A, the best
systems were constrained. Again, all participating
systems outperformed the majority class baseline;
however, some systems were very close to it.

6 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979367647059">
Overall, we observed similar trends as in
SemEval-2013 Task 2. Almost all systems used
supervised learning. Most systems were con-
strained, including the best ones in all categories.
As in 2013, we observed several cases of a team
submitting a constrained and an unconstrained run
and the constrained run performing better.
It is unclear why unconstrained systems did not
outperform constrained ones. It could be because
participants did not use enough external data or
because the data they used was too different from
Twitter or from our annotation method. Or it could
be due to our definition of unconstrained, which
labels as unconstrained systems that use additional
tweets directly, but considers unconstrained those
that use additional tweets to build sentiment lexi-
cons and then use these lexicons.
As in 2013, the most popular classifiers were
SVM, MaxEnt, and Naive Bayes. Moreover, two
submissions used deep learning, coooolll (Harbin
Institute of Technology) and ThinkPositive (IBM
Research, Brazil), which were ranked second and
tenth on subtask B, respectively.
The features used were quite varied, includ-
ing word-based (e.g., word and character n-
grams, word shapes, and lemmata), syntactic, and
Twitter-specific such as emoticons and abbrevia-
tions. The participants still relied heavily on lex-
icons of opinion words, the most popular ones
being the same as in 2013: MPQA, SentiWord-
Net and Bing Liu’s opinion lexicon. Popular this
year was also the NRC lexicon (Mohammad et
al., 2013), created by the best-performing team in
2013, which is top-performing this year as well.
Preprocessing of tweets was still a popular tech-
nique. In addition to standard NLP steps such
as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-
word removal and POS tagging, most teams ap-
plied some kind of Twitter-specific processing
such as substitution/removal of URLs, substitu-
tion of emoticons, word normalization, abbrevi-
ation lookup, and punctuation removal. Finally,
several of the teams used Twitter-tuned NLP tools
such as part of speech and named entity taggers
(Gimpel et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2011).
The similarity of preprocessing techniques,
NLP tools, classifiers and features used in 2013
and this year is probably partially due to many
teams participating in both years. As Table 6
shows, 18 out of the 46 teams are returning teams.
Comparing the results on the progress Twit-
ter test in 2013 and 2014, we can see that NRC-
Canada, the 2013 winner for subtask A, have
now improved their F1 score from 88.93 to 90.14,
which is the 2014 best score. The best score on the
Progress SMS in 2014 of 89.31 belongs to ECNU;
this is a big jump compared to their 2013 score of
76.69, but it is less compared to the 2013 best of
88.37 achieved by GU-MLT-LT. For subtask B, on
the Twitter progress testset, the 2013 winner NRC-
Canada improves their 2013 result from 69.02 to
70.75, which is the second best in 2014; the win-
ner in 2014, TeamX, achieves 72.12. On the SMS
progress test, the 2013 winner NRC-Canada im-
proves its F1 score from 68.46 to 70.28. Overall,
we see consistent improvements on the progress
testset for both subtasks: 0-1 and 2-3 points abso-
lute for subtasks A and B, respectively.

Twitter2013-test), and the ° indicates a system that includes a task co-organizer as a team member. The
systems are sorted by their score on the Twitter2014 test dataset; the rankings on the individual datasets
are indicated with a subscript. The last two columns show macro- and micro-averaged results across the
three 2014 test datasets.
Finally, note that for both subtasks, the best sys-
tems on the Twitter-2014 dataset are those that per-
formed best on the 2013 progress Twitter dataset:
NRC-Canada for subtask A, and TeamX (Fuji Xe-
rox Co., Ltd.) for subtask B.
It is interesting to note that the best results
for Twitter2014-test are lower than those for
Twitter2013-test for both subtask A (86.63 vs.
90.14) and subtask B (70.96 vs 72.12). This is
so despite the baselines for Twitter2014-test be-
ing higher than those for Twitter2013-test: 42.2 vs.
38.1 for subtask A, and 34.6 vs. 29.2 for subtask
B. Most likely, having access to Twitter2013-test
at development time, teams have overfitted on it. It
could be also the case that some of the sentiment
dictionaries that were built in 2013 have become
somewhat outdated by 2014.
Finally, note that while some teams such as
NRC-Canada performed well across all test sets,
other such as TeamX, which used a weighting
scheme tuned specifically for class imbalances in
tweets, were only strong on Twitter datasets.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998065">
We have described the data, the experimental
setup and the results for SemEval-2014 Task 9.
As in 2013, our task was the most popular one at
SemEval-2014, attracting 46 participating teams:
21 in subtask A (27 submissions) and 44 in sub-
task B (50 submissions).
We introduced three new test sets for 2014: an
in-domain Twitter dataset, an out-of-domain Live-
Journal test set, and a dataset of tweets contain-
ing sarcastic content. While the performance on
the LiveJournal test set was mostly comparable
to the in-domain Twitter test set, for most teams
there was a sharp drop in performance for sarcas-
tic tweets, highlighting better handling of sarcas-
tic language as one important direction for future
work in Twitter sentiment analysis.
We plan to run the task again in 2015 with the
inclusion of a new sub-evaluation on detecting sar-
casm with the goal of stimulating research in this
area; we further plan to add one more test domain.

As in 2013, this was the most popular SemEval task; a total of 46 teams contributed 27 submissions for subtask A (21 teams) and 50 submissions for subtask B (44 teams). This year, we introduced three test sets: regular tweets, sarcastweets, and LiveJournal sentences. further tested on 2013 tweets, and 2013 SMS messages.

We altered the annotation task for the sarcastic tweets, displaying them to the Mechanical Turk annotators without the #sarcasm hashtag; the Turkers had to determine whether the tweet is sarcastic on their own. Moreover, we asked Turkers to indicate the degree of sarcasm as (a) definitely sarcastic, (b) probably sarcastic, and (c) not sarcastic. As in 2013, we combined the annotations using intersection, where a word had to appear in 2/3 of the annotations to be accepted.

We further added a new 2014 Twitter test set, as well as a small set of tweets that contained the #sarcasm hashtag to determine how sarcasm affects the tweet polarity.

Moreover, two submissions used deep learning, coooolll (Harbin Institute of Technology) and ThinkPositive (IBM Research, Brazil), which were ranked second and tenth on subtask B, respectively. The features used were quite varied, including word-based (e.g., word and character ngrams, word shapes, and lemmata), syntactic, and Twitter-specific such as emoticons and abbreviations. The participants still relied heavily on lexicons of opinion words, the most popular ones being the same as in 2013: MPQA, SentiWordNet and Bing Liu’s opinion lexicon. Popular this year was also the NRC lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013), created by the best-performing team in 2013, which is top-performing this year as well. Preprocessing of tweets was still a popular technique. In addition to standard NLP steps such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal and POS tagging, most teams applied some kind of Twitter-specific processing such as substitution/removal of URLs, substitution of emoticons, word normalization, abbreviation lookup, and punctuation removal. Finally, several of the teams used Twitter-tuned NLP tools such as part of speech and named entity taggers (Gimpel et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2011)</context>

While some Twitter sentiment datasets were created prior to SemEval-2013, they were either small and proprietary, such as the isieve corpus (Kouloumpis et al., 2011) or focused solely on message-level sentiment. Thus, the primary goal of our SemEval task is to promote research that will lead to better understanding of how sentiment is conveyed in Social Media. Toward that goal, we created the SemEval Tweet corpus as part of our inaugural Sentiment Analysis in Twitter Task, SemEval-2013 Task 2 (Nakov et al., 2013). It contains tweets and SMS messages with sentiment expressions annotated with contextual phrase-level and messagelevel polarity. This year, we extended the corpus by adding new tweets and LiveJournal sentences. Another interesting phenomenon that has been studied in Twitter is the use of the #sarcasm hashtag to indicate that a tweet should not be taken literally (Gonz´alez-Ib´a˜nez et al., 2011; Liebrecht et al., 2013). In fact, sarcasm indicates that the message polarity should be flipped. With this in mind, this year, we also evaluate on sarcastic tweets. 73 Proceedings of the 8th Internat</context>

Preprocessing of tweets was still a popular technique. In addition to standard NLP steps such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal and POS tagging, most teams applied some kind of Twitter-specific processing such as substitution/removal of URLs, substitution of emoticons, word normalization, abbreviation lookup, and punctuation removal. Finally, several of the teams used Twitter-tuned NLP tools such as part of speech and named entity taggers (Gimpel et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2011). The similarity of preprocessing techniques, NLP tools, classifiers and features used in 2013 and this year is probably partially due to many teams participating in both years. As Table 6 shows, 18 out of the 46 teams are returning teams. Comparing the results on the progress Twitter test in 2013 and 2014, we can see that NRCCanada, the 2013 winner for subtask A, have now improved their F1 score from 88.93 to 90.14, which is the 2014 best score. The best score on the Progress SMS in 2014 of 89.31 belongs to ECNU; this is a big jump compared to their 2013 score of 76.69, but it is less compare</context>
