Automatic topic segmentation, separation of
a discourse stream into its constituent sto-
ries or topics, is a necessary preprocessing
step for applications such as information re-
trieval, anaphora resolution, and summariza-
tion. While significant progress has been made
in this area for text sources and for English au-
dio sources, little work has been done in au-
tomatic, acoustic feature-based segmentation
of other languages. In this paper, we focus
on prosody-based topic segmentation of Man-
darin Chinese. As a tone language, Man-
darin presents special challenges for applica-
bility of intonation-based techniques, since the
pitch contour is also used to establish lexical
identity. We demonstrate that intonational cues
such as reduction in pitch and intensity at topic
boundaries and increase in duration and pause
still provide significant contrasts in Mandarin
Chinese. We also build a decision tree classi-
fier that, based only on word and local context
prosodic information without reference to term
similarity, cue phrase, or sentence-level infor-
mation, achieves boundary classification accu-
racy of 89-95.8% on a large standard test set.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999773936170213">
Natural spoken discourse is composed a sequence of ut-
terances, not independently generated or randomly strung
together, but rather organized according to basic struc-
tural principles. This structure in turn guides the inter-
pretation of individual utterances and the discourse as a
whole. Formal written discourse signals a hierarchical,
tree-based discourse structure explicitly by the division
of the text into chapters, sections, paragraphs, and sen-
tences. This structure, in turn, identifies domains for in-
terpretation; many systems for anaphora resolution rely
on some notion of locality (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
Similarly, this structure represents topical organization,
and thus would be useful in information retrieval to se-
lect documents where the primary sections are on-topic,
and, for summarization, to select information covering
the different aspects of the topic.
Unfortunately, spoken discourse does not include the
orthographic conventions that signal structural organiza-
tion in written discourse. Instead, one must infer the hi-
erarchical structure of spoken discourse from other cues.
Prior research (Nakatani et al., 1995; Swerts, 1997) has
shown that human labelers can more sharply, consis-
tently, and confidently identify discourse structure in a
word-level transcription when an original audio record-
ing is available than they can on the basis of the tran-
scribed text alone. This finding indicates that substan-
tial additional information about the structure of the dis-
course is encoded in the acoustic-prosodic features of the
utterance. Given the often errorful transcriptions avail-
able for large speech corpora, we choose to focus here on
fully exploiting the prosodic cues to discourse structure
present in the original speech, rather than on the lexical
cues or term frequencies of the transcription.
In the current set of experiments, we concentrate on se-
quential segmentation of news broadcasts into individual
stories. While a richer hierarchical segmentation is ulti-
mately desirable, sequential story segmentation provides
a natural starting point. This level of segmentation can
also be most reliably performed by human labelers and
thus can be considered most robust, and segmented data
sets are publicly available.
Furthermore, we apply prosodic-based segmentation to
Mandarin Chinese. Not only is the use of prosodic cues
to topic segmentation much less well-studied in general
than is the use of text cues, but the use of prosodic cues
has been largely limited to English and other European
languages.

Most prior research on automatic topic segmentation has
been applied to clean text only and thus used textual fea-
tures. Text-based segmentation approaches have utilized
term-based similarity measures computed across candi-
date segments (Hearst, 1994) and also discourse markers
to identify discourse structure (Marcu, 2000).
The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) evaluations
focused on segmentation of both text and speech sources.
This framework introduced new challenges in dealing
with errorful automatic transcriptions as well as new op-
portunities to exploit cues in the original speech. The
most successful approach (Beeferman et al., 1999) pro-
duced automatic segmentations that yielded retrieval re-
sults comparable to those with manual segmentations, us-
ing text and silence features. (Tur et al., 2001) applied
both a prosody-only and a mixed text-prosody model
to segmentation of TDT English broadcast news, with
the best results combining text and prosodic features.
(Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1998) also examined auto-
matic topic segmentation based on prosodic cues, in the
domain of English broadcast news.
Work in discourse analysis (Nakatani et al., 1995;
Swerts, 1997) in both English and Dutch has identified
features such as changes in pitch range, intensity, and
speaking rate associated with segment boundaries and
with boundaries of different strengths. They also demon-
strated that access to acoustic cues improves the ease and
quality of human labeling.

3 Prosody and Mandarin
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999435615384615">
In this paper we focus on topic segmentation in Mandarin
Chinese broadcast news. Mandarin Chinese is a tone lan-
guage in which lexical identity is determined by a pitch
contour - or tone - associated with each syllable. This
additional use of pitch raises the question of the cross-
linguistic applicability of the prosodic cues, especially
pitch cues, identified for non-tone languages. Specifi-
cally, do we find intonational cues in tone languages? The
fact that emphasis is marked intonationally by expansion
of pitch range even in the presence of Mandarin lexical
tone (Shen, 1989) suggests encouragingly that prosodic,
intonational cues to other aspects of information structure
might also prove robust in tone languages.

4 Prosodic Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987214285714">
We consider four main classes of prosodic features for
our analysis and classification: pitch, intensity, silence
and duration. Pitch, as represented by f0 in Hertz was
computed by the “To pitch” function of the Praat sys-
tem (Boersma, 2001). We selected the highest ranked
pitch candidate value in each voiced region. We then ap-
plied a 5-point median filter to smooth out local instabili-
ties in the signal such as vocal fry or small regions of spu-
rious doubling or halving. Analogously, we computed the
intensity in decibels for each 10ms frame with the Praat
“To intensity” function, followed by similar smoothing.
For consistency and to allow comparability, we com-
pute all figures for word-based units, using the ASR tran-
scriptions provided with the TDT Mandarin data. The
words are used to establish time spans for computing
pitch or intensity mean or maximum values, to enable du-
rational normalization and the pairwise comparisons re-
ported below, and to identify silence duration.
It is well-established (Ross and Ostendorf, 1996) that
for robust analysis pitch and intensity should be nor-
malized by speaker, since, for example, average pitch
is largely incomparable for male and female speak-
ers. In the absence of speaker identification software,
we approximate speaker normalization with story-based
normalization, computed as , assuming one
speaker per topic&apos;. For duration, we consider both abso-
lute and normalized word duration, where average word
duration is used as the mean in the calculation above.

We utilize the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT)
3 (Wayne, 2000) collection Mandarin Chinese broadcast
news audio corpus as our data set. Story segmentation in
Mandarin and English broadcast news and newswire text
was one of the TDT tasks and also an enabling technol-
ogy for other retrieval tasks. We use the segment bound-
aries provided with the corpus as our gold standard label-
ing. Our collection comprises 3014 stories drawn from
approximately 113 hours over three months (October-
December 1998) of news broadcasts from the Voice of
America (VOA) in Mandarin Chinese. The transcriptions
span approximately 740,000 words. The audio is stored
in NIST Sphere format sampled at 16KHz with 16-bit lin-
ear encoding.

6 Prosodic Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996460727272727">
To evaluate the potential applicability of prosodic fea-
tures to story segmentation in Mandarin Chinese, we per-
formed some initial data analysis to determine if words
in story-final position differed from the same words used
throughout the story. This lexical match allows direct
pairwise comparison. We anticipated that since words in
Mandarin varied not only in phoneme sequence but also
in tone sequence, a direct comparison might be particu-
larly important to eliminate sources of variability. Fea-
tures that differed significantly would form the basis of
our classifier feature set.

<figureCaption confidence="0.798239333333333">
&apos;This is an imperfect approximation as some stories include
off-site interviews, but seems a reasonable choice in the absence
of automatic speaker identification.
Figure 1: Differences in duration, normalized pitch, and
normalized intensity between words in segment non-final
and segment-final positions.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845818181818">
We found highly significant differences based on
paired t-test two-tailed, ( ), for
each of the features we considered. Specifically, word
duration, normalized mean pitch, and normalized mean
intensity all differed significantly for words in topic-final
position relative to occurrences throughout the story (Fig-
ure 1). Word duration increased, while both pitch and
intensity decreased. A small side experiment using 15
hours of English broadcast news from the TDT collec-
tion shows similar trends, though the magnitude of the
change in intensity is smaller than that observed for the
Chinese.
These contrasts are consistent with, though in some
cases stronger than, those identified for English (Nakatani
et al., 1995) and Dutch (Swerts, 1997). The relatively
large size of the corpus enhances the salience of these
effects. We find, importantly, that reduction in pitch as
a signal of topic finality is robust across the typological
contrast of tone and non-tone languages. These findings
demonstrate highly significant intonational effects even
in tone languages and suggest that prosodic cues may be
robust across wide ranges of languages.

7.1 Feature Set

<bodyText confidence="0.9999839375">
The results above indicate that duration, pitch, and inten-
sity should be useful for automatic prosody-based iden-
tification of topic boundaries. To facilitate cross-speaker
comparisons, we use normalized representations of aver-
age pitch, average intensity, and word duration. We also
include absolute word duration. These features form a
word-level context-independent feature set.
Since segment boundaries and their cues exist to con-
trastively signal the separation between topics, we aug-
ment these features with local context-dependent mea-
sures. Specifically, we add features that measure the
change between the current word and the next word. 2
This contextualization adds four contextual features:
change in normalized average pitch, change in normal-
ized average intensity, change in normalized word dura-
tion, and duration of following silence.

7.2 Classifier Training and Testing Configuration

We employed Quinlan’s C4.5 (Quinlan, 1992) decision
tree classifier to provide a readily interpretable classifier.
Now, the vast majority of word positions in our collec-
tion are non-topic-final. So, in order to focus training and
test on topic boundary identification, we downsample our
corpus to produce training and test sets with a 50/50 split
of topic-final and non-topic-final words. We trained on
2789 topic-final words 3 and 2789 non-topic-final words,
not matched in any way, drawn randomly from the full
corpus. We tested on a held-out set of 200 topic-final and
non-topic-final words.

<bodyText confidence="0.976243285714286">
The resulting classifier achieved 95.8% accuracy on the
held-out test set, closely approximately pruned tree per-
formance on the training set. This effectiveness is a sub-
stantial improvement over the sample baseline of 50%. 4
A portion of the decision tree is reproduced in Figure 2.
Inspection of the tree indicates the key role of silence as
well as the use of both contextual and purely local fea-
tures of both pitch and intensity. Durational features play
a lesser role in the classifier. The classifier relies on the
theoretically and empirically grounded features of pitch
and intensity and silence, where it has been suggested that
higher pitch and wider range are associated with topic
initiation and lower pitch or narrower range is associated
with topic finality.
We also performed a contrastive experiment where si-
lence features were excluded, to assess the dependence
on these features. 5 The resulting classifier achieved an
accuracy of 89.4% on the heldout balanced test set, rein-
forcing the utility of pitch and intensity features for clas-
sification.
We performed a second set of contrastive experiments
to explore the impact of different lexical tones on classi-
fication accuracy. We grouped words based on the lexical

of finding segment-final words, so the technique incorporates a

in classification with all groups achieving 94-96% accu-

on discourse position is comparable to that based on lex-
ical tone identity, and the overlap between pitch values in
non-final and final positions is relatively small, we obtain
consistent results.

8 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981136363636">
We have demonstrated the applicability of intonational
prosodic features, specifically pitch, intensity, pause and
duration, to the identification of topic boundaries in a tone
language, Mandarin Chinese. We find highly significant
decreases in pitch and intensity at topic final positions,
and significant increases in word duration. Furthermore,
these features in both local and contextualized form pro-
vide the basis for an effective decision tree classifier of
boundary positions that does not use term similarity or
cue phrase information, but only prosodic features. We
also find that analogous to (Tur et al., 2001)’s work on
an English story segmentation task, pause and pitch - both
for the individual word and adjacency pair - play a crucial
role; our findings for Chinese, however, identify a greater
role played by intensity and durational contrasts.
There is still substantial work to be done. We would
like to integrate speaker identification for normalization
and speaker change detection. We also plan to explore
the integration of prosodic and textual features and in-
vestigate the identification of more fine-grained sub-topic
structure, to provide more focused units for information
retrieval, summarization, and anaphora resolution.

Not only is the use of prosodic cues to topic segmentation much less well-studied in general than is the use of text cues, but the use of prosodic cues has been largely limited to English and other European languages. 2 Related Work Most prior research on automatic topic segmentation has been applied to clean text only and thus used textual features. Text-based segmentation approaches have utilized term-based similarity measures computed across candidate segments (Hearst, 1994) and also discourse markers to identify discourse structure (Marcu, 2000). The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) evaluations focused on segmentation of both text and speech sources. This framework introduced new challenges in dealing with errorful automatic transcriptions as well as new opportunities to exploit cues in the original speech. The most successful approach (Beeferman et al., 1999) produced automatic segmentations that yielded retrieval results comparable to those with manual segmentations, using text and silence features.

Similarly, this structure represents topical organization, and thus would be useful in information retrieval to select documents where the primary sections are on-topic, and, for summarization, to select information covering the different aspects of the topic. Unfortunately, spoken discourse does not include the orthographic conventions that signal structural organization in written discourse. Instead, one must infer the hierarchical structure of spoken discourse from other cues. Prior research (Nakatani et al., 1995; Swerts, 1997) has shown that human labelers can more sharply, consistently, and confidently identify discourse structure in a word-level transcription when an original audio recording is available than they can on the basis of the transcribed text alone. This finding indicates that substantial additional information about the structure of the discourse is encoded in the acoustic-prosodic features of the utterance.

Specifically, word duration, normalized mean pitch, and normalized mean intensity all differed significantly for words in topic-final position relative to occurrences throughout the story (Figure 1). Word duration increased, while both pitch and intensity decreased. A small side experiment using 15 hours of English broadcast news from the TDT collection shows similar trends, though the magnitude of the change in intensity is smaller than that observed for the Chinese. These contrasts are consistent with, though in some cases stronger than, those identified for English (Nakatani et al., 1995) and Dutch (Swerts, 1997). The relatively large size of the corpus enhances the salience of these effects. We find, importantly, that reduction in pitch as a signal of topic finality is robust across the typological contrast of tone and non-tone languages. These findings demonstrate highly significant intonational effects even in tone languages and suggest that prosodic cues may be robust across wide ranges of languages. 7 Classification 7.1 Feature Set The results above indicate that duration, pitch, and intensity should be useful for automatic prosody-based identification of topic boundaries</context>

Since segment boundaries and their cues exist to contrastively signal the separation between topics, we augment these features with local context-dependent measures. Specifically, we add features that measure the change between the current word and the next word. 2 This contextualization adds four contextual features: change in normalized average pitch, change in normalized average intensity, change in normalized word duration, and duration of following silence. 7.2 Classifier Training and Testing Configuration We employed Quinlan’s C4.5 (Quinlan, 1992) decision tree classifier to provide a readily interpretable classifier. Now, the vast majority of word positions in our collection are non-topic-final. So, in order to focus training and test on topic boundary identification, we downsample our corpus to produce training and test sets with a 50/50 split of topic-final and non-topic-final words. We trained on 2789 topic-final words 3 and 2789 non-topic-final words, not matched in any way, drawn randomly from the full corpus. We tested on a held-out set of 200 topic-final and non-topic-final words. 7.3 Classifier Evaluation The resulting classif</context>

Analogously, we computed the intensity in decibels for each 10ms frame with the Praat “To intensity” function, followed by similar smoothing. For consistency and to allow comparability, we compute all figures for word-based units, using the ASR transcriptions provided with the TDT Mandarin data. The words are used to establish time spans for computing pitch or intensity mean or maximum values, to enable durational normalization and the pairwise comparisons reported below, and to identify silence duration. It is well-established (Ross and Ostendorf, 1996) that for robust analysis pitch and intensity should be normalized by speaker, since, for example, average pitch is largely incomparable for male and female speakers. In the absence of speaker identification software, we approximate speaker normalization with story-based normalization, computed as , assuming one speaker per topic&apos;.

Mandarin Chinese is a tone language in which lexical identity is determined by a pitch contour - or tone - associated with each syllable. This additional use of pitch raises the question of the crosslinguistic applicability of the prosodic cues, especially pitch cues, identified for non-tone languages. Specifically, do we find intonational cues in tone languages? The fact that emphasis is marked intonationally by expansion of pitch range even in the presence of Mandarin lexical tone (Shen, 1989) suggests encouragingly that prosodic, intonational cues to other aspects of information structure might also prove robust in tone languages. 4 Prosodic Features We consider four main classes of prosodic features for our analysis and classification: pitch, intensity, silence and duration. Pitch, as represented by f0 in Hertz was computed by the “To pitch” function of the Praat system (Boersma, 2001). We selected the highest ranked pitch candidate value in each voiced region. We then applied a 5-point median filter to smooth out local instabilities in the signal such as vocal fry or small regio</context>

We find highly significant decreases in pitch and intensity at topic final positions, and significant increases in word duration. Furthermore, these features in both local and contextualized form provide the basis for an effective decision tree classifier of boundary positions that does not use term similarity or cue phrase information, but only prosodic features. We also find that analogous to (Tur et al., 2001)’s work on an English story segmentation task, pause and pitch - both for the individual word and adjacency pair - play a crucial role; our findings for Chinese, however, identify a greater role played by intensity and durational contrasts. There is still substantial work to be done. We would like to integrate speaker identification for normalization and speaker change detection. We also plan to explore the integration of prosodic and textual features and investigate the identification of more fine-grained sub-topic structure, to provide more focused units for information retrieval, summarizat</context>
