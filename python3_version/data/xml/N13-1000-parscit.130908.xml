Welcome everyone!
It is my pleasure to welcome you all to Atlanta, Georgia, for the 2013 NAACL Human Language
Technologies conference. This is a great opportunity to reconnect with old friends and make new
acquaintances, learn the latest in your own field and become curious about new areas, and also to
experience Atlanta’s warm southern hospitality. That hospitality starts with Priscilla Rasmussen!
Priscilla thinks about everything that we all take for granted: the registration that just took place, the
rooms in which we sit, the refreshments that keep us energized, and the social events that make this
conference so fun, and many other details that you would miss if they weren’t there. Please introduce
yourself and say hi. Priscilla is the backbone of the NAACL organization. Thank you!
This conference started a year ago, when Hal Daumé III and Katrin Kirchhoff graciously agreed to be
program co-chairs. It is no exaggeration to say how much their dedication has shaped this conference
and how grateful I am for their initiative and hard work. Thank you Hal and Katrin, especially for all
the fun discussion that made the work light and the year go by fast! This conference could not have
happened with you.
Thanks go to the entire organizing committee. As I am writing this to be included in the proceedings, I
am grateful for the fantastic detailed and proactive work by Colin Cherry and Matt Post, the publications
chairs. The tutorials chairs, Katrin Erk and Jimmy Lin, selected, and solicited, 6 tutorials to present in
depth material on some of the diverse topics represented in our community. Chris Dyer and Derrick
Higgins considered which projects shine best when shown as a demonstration. The workshops chairs
for NAACL, Sujith Ravi and Luke Zettlemoyer, worked jointly with ACL and EMNLP to select the
workshops to be held at NAACL. They also worked with ICML 2013 to co-host workshops that bridge
the two communities, in addition to the Joint NAACL/ICML symposium.
Posters from the student research workshop are part of the poster and demonstrations session on
Monday night. This is a great opportunity for the students to be recognized in the community and
to benefit from lively discussion of their presentations (attendees take note!) Annie Louis and Richard
Socher are the student research workshop chairs, and Julia Hockenmaier and Eric Ringger generously
share their wisdom as the faculty advisors. The student research workshop itself will be held on the
first day of workshops. There are so many people who contribute their time to the behind-the-scenes
organization of the conference, without which the conference cannot take place. Asking for money is
probably not a natural fit for anyone, but Chris Brew worked on local sponsorship, and Dan Bikel and
Patrick Pantel worked to obtain sponsorship across the ACL conferences this year - thank you! Jacob
Eisenstein had the more fun role of distributing money as the student volunteer coordinator, and we
thank all of the student volunteers who will be helping to run a smooth conference. Kristy Boyer kept
the communication “short and tweet” using a variety of social media (and old-fashioned media too). An
important part of the behind-the-scenes efforts that enable a conference like NAACL to come together
are the sponsors. We thank all of the sponsors for the contributions to the conference , both for the
general funding made available as well as the specific programs that are funded through sponsorship.
You can read more about these sponsors in our conference handbook.
This year there are several initiatives, and if successful, we hope they’ll be part of NAACL conferences
iii
in the future. One is to make the proceedings available prior to the conference; we hope you will benefit
from the extra time to read the papers beforehand. Another is for tutorials and all oral presentations to
be recorded on video and made available post-conference. We are also delighted to host presentations,
in both oral and poster formats, from the new Transactions of the ACL journal, to enhance the impact
these will already have as journal publications. Finally, Matt Post is creating a new digital form of
conference handbook to go with our digital age; thanks also go to Alex Clemmer who has prepared
the paper copy that you may be reading right now. We hope you use the #NAACL2013 tag when you
are tweeting about the conference or papers at the conference; together, we’ll be creating a new social
media corpus to explore.
Once again, we are pleased to be co-located with *SEM conference, and the SemEval workshop. We
are lucky to have ICML 2013 organized so close in time and place. Several researchers who span the
two communities have reconvened the Joint NAACL/ICML symposium on June 15, 2013. In addition,
two workshops that address areas of interest to both NAACL and ICML members have been organized
on June 16th, as part of the ICML conference.
NAACL 2013 has given me a great appreciation for the volunteering that is part of our culture. Besides
the organizing committee itself, we are guided by the NAACL executive board, who think about
questions with a multi-year perspective. I also want to recognize the members who first initiated and
now maintain the ACL Anthology, where all of our published work will be available to all in perpetuity,
a fabulous contribution and one that distinguishes our academic community.
Have a fun conference!

Program Chair Preface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994121258064516">
Welcome to NAACL HLT 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia. We have an exciting program consisting of six
tutorials, 24 sessions of talks (both for long and short papers), an insane poster madness session that
includes posters from the newly revamped student research workshop, ten workshops and two additional
cross-pollination workshops held jointly with ICML (occurring immediately after NAACL HLT, just
one block away). There are a few innovations in the conference this year, the most noticeable of which
is the twitter channel #naacl2013 and the fact that we are the first conference to host papers published
in the Transactions of the ACL journal – there are six such papers in our program, marked as [TACL].
We are very excited about our two invited talks, one on Monday morning and one Wednesday morning.
The first is by Gina Kuperberg, who will talk about “Predicting Meaning: What the Brain tells us about
the Architecture of Language Comprehension.” The second presenter is our own Kathleen KcKeown,
who will talk about “Natural Language Applications from Fact to Fiction.”
The morning session on Tuesday includes the presentation of best paper awards to two worthy
recipients. The award for Best Short Paper goes to Marta Recasens, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe
and Christopher Potts for their paper “The Life and Death of Discourse Entities: Identifying Singleton
Mentions” The award for Best Student Paper goes to the long paper “Automatic Generation of English
Respellings” by Bradley Hauer and Greg Kondrak. We gratefully acknowledge IBM’s support for
the Student Best Paper Award. Finally, many thanks to the Best Paper Committee for selecting these
excellent papers!
The complete program includes 95 long papers (of which six represent presentations from the journal
Transactions of the ACL, a first for any ACL conference!) and 51 short papers. We are excited that the
conference is able to present such a dynamic array of papers, and would like to thank the authors for
their great work. We worked hard to keep the conference to three parallel sessions at any one time to
hopefully maximize a participant’s ability to see everything she wants! This represents an acceptance
rate of 30% for long papers and 37% for short papers. More details about the distribution across areas
and other statistics will be made available in the NAACL HLT Program Chair report on the ACL wiki:
http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Reports
The review process for the conference was double-blind, and included an author response period for
clarifying reviewers’ questions. We were very pleased to have the assistance of 350 reviewers, each
of whom reviewed an average of 3.7 papers, in deciding the program. We are especially thankful
for the reviewers who spent time reading the author responses and engaging other reviewers in the
discussion board. Assigning reviewers would not have been possible without the hard work of Mark
Dredze and his miracle assignment scripts. Furthermore, constructing the program would not have been
possible without 22 excellent area chairs forming the Senior Program Committee: Eugene Agichtein,
Srinivas Bangalore, David Bean, Phil Blunsom, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Marine Carpuat, Joyce Chai,
Vera Demberg, Bill Dolan, Doug Downey, Mark Dredze, Markus Dreyer, Sanda Harabagiu, James
Henderson, Guy Lapalme, Alon Lavie, Percy Liang, Johanna Moore, Ani Nenkova, Joakim Nivre, Bo
Pang, Zak Shafran, David Traum, Peter Turney, and Theresa Wilson. Area chairs were responsible
for managing paper assignments, collating reviewer responses, handling papers for other area chairs
or program chairs who had conflicts of interest, making recommendations for paper acceptance or
rejection, and nominating best papers from their areas. We are very grateful for the time and energy
v
that they have put into the program.
There are a number of other people that we interacted with who deserve a hearty thanks for the success
of the program. Rich Gerber and the START team at Softconf have been invaluable for helping us with
the mechanics of the reviewing process. Matt Post and Colin Cherry, as publications co-chairs, have
been very helpful in assembling the final program and coordinating the publications of the workshop
proceedings. There are several crucial parts of the overall program that were the responsibility of
various contributors, including Annie Louis, Richard Socher, Julia Hockenmaier and Eric Ringger
(Student Research Workshop chairs, who did an amazing job revamping the SRW); Jimmy Lin and
Katrin Erk (Tutorial Chairs); Luke Zettlemoyer and Sujith Ravi (Workshop Chairs); Chris Dyer and
Derrick Higgins (Demo Chairs); Jacob Eisenstein (Student Volunteer Coordinator); Chris Brew (Local
Sponsorship Chair); Patrick Pantel and Dan Bikel (Sponsorship Chairs); and the new-founded Publicity
chair who handled #naacl2013 tweeting among other things, Kristy Boyer.
We would also like to thank Chris Callison-Burch and the NAACL Executive Board for guidance during
the process. Michael Collins was amazingly helpful in getting the inaugural TACL papers into the
NAACL HLT conference. Priscilla Rasmussen deserves, as always, special mention and warmest thanks
as the local arrangements chair and general business manager. Priscilla is amazing and everyone who
sees her at the conference should thank her.
Finally, we would like to thank our General Chair, Lucy Vanderwende, for both her trust and guidance
during this process. She helped turn the less-than-wonderful parts of this job to roses, and her ability to
organize an incredibly complex event is awe inspiring. None of this would have happened without her.
We hope that you enjoy the conference!

<abstract confidence="0.96880732">ISBN 978-1-937284-47-3 ii General Chair Preface Welcome everyone! It is my pleasure to welcome you all to Atlanta, Georgia, for the 2013 NAACL Human Language Technologies conference. This is a great opportunity to reconnect with old friends and make new acquaintances, learn the latest in your own field and become curious about new areas, and also to experience Atlanta’s warm southern hospitality. That hospitality starts with Priscilla Rasmussen! Priscilla thinks about everything that we all take for granted: the registration that just took place, the rooms in which we sit, the refreshments that keep us energized, and the social events that make this conference so fun, and many other details that you would miss if they weren’t there. Please introduce yourself and say hi. Priscilla is the backbone of the NAACL organization. Thank you! This conference started a year ago, when Hal Daumé III and Katrin Kirchhoff graciously agreed to be program co-chairs. It is no exaggeration to say how much their dedication has shaped this conference and how grateful I am for their initiative and hard work. Thank you Hal and Katrin, especially for all the fun discussion that made the work light and the year go by fast! This conference could not have happened with you. Thanks go to the entire organizing committee. As I am writing this to be included in the proceedings, I am grateful for the fantastic detailed and proactive work by Colin Cherry and Matt Post, the publications chairs. The tutorials chairs, Katrin Erk and Jimmy Lin, selected, and solicited, 6 tutorials to present in depth material on some of the diverse topics represented in our community. Chris Dyer and Derrick Higgins considered which projects shine best when shown as a demonstration. The workshops chairs for NAACL, Sujith Ravi and Luke Zettlemoyer, worked jointly with ACL and EMNLP to select the workshops to be held at NAACL. They also worked with ICML 2013 to co-host workshops that bridge the two communities, in addition to the Joint NAACL/ICML symposium. Posters from the student research workshop are part of the poster and demonstrations session on Monday night. This is a great opportunity for the students to be recognized in the community and to benefit from lively discussion of their presentations (attendees take note!) Annie Louis and Richard Socher are the student research workshop chairs, and Julia Hockenmaier and Eric Ringger generously share their wisdom as the faculty advisors. The student research workshop itself will be held on the first day of workshops. There are so many people who contribute their time to the behind-the-scenes organization of the conference, without which the conference cannot take place. Asking for money is probably not a natural fit for anyone, but Chris Brew worked on local sponsorship, and Dan Bikel and Patrick Pantel worked to obtain sponsorship across the ACL conferences this year thank you! Jacob Eisenstein had the more fun role of distributing money as the student volunteer coordinator, and we thank all of the student volunteers who will be helping to run a smooth conference. Kristy Boyer kept the communication “short and tweet” using a variety of social media (and old-fashioned media too). An important part of the behind-the-scenes efforts that enable a conference like NAACL to come together are the sponsors. We thank all of the sponsors for the contributions to the conference , both for the general funding made available as well as the specific programs that are funded through sponsorship. You can read more about these sponsors in our conference handbook. This year there are several initiatives, and if successful, we hope they’ll be part of NAACL conferences iii in the future. One is to make the proceedings available prior to the conference; we hope you will benefit from the extra time to read the papers beforehand. Another is for tutorials and all oral presentations to be recorded on video and made available post-conference. We are also delighted to host presentations, in both oral and poster formats, from the new Transactions of the ACL journal, to enhance the impact these will already have as journal publications. Finally, Matt Post is creating a new digital form of conference handbook to go with our digital age; thanks also go to Alex Clemmer who has prepared the paper copy that you may be reading right now. We hope you use the #NAACL2013 tag when you are tweeting about the conference or papers at the conference; together, we’ll be creating a new social media corpus to explore. Once again, we are pleased to be co-located with *SEM conference, and the SemEval workshop. We are lucky to have ICML 2013 organized so close in time and place. Several researchers who span the two communities have reconvened the Joint NAACL/ICML symposium on June 15, 2013. In addition, two workshops that address areas of interest to both NAACL and ICML members have been organized on June 16th, as part of the ICML conference. NAACL 2013 has given me a great appreciation for the volunteering that is part of our culture. Besides the organizing committee itself, we are guided by the NAACL executive board, who think about questions with a multi-year perspective. I also want to recognize the members who first initiated and now maintain the ACL Anthology, where all of our published work will be available to all in perpetuity, a fabulous contribution and one that distinguishes our academic community. Have a fun conference! Lucy Vanderwende, Microsoft Research NAACL HLT 2013 General Chair iv Program Chair Preface Welcome to NAACL HLT 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia. We have an exciting program consisting of six tutorials, 24 sessions of talks (both for long and short papers), an insane poster madness session that includes posters from the newly revamped student research workshop, ten workshops and two additional cross-pollination workshops held jointly with ICML (occurring immediately after NAACL HLT, just one block away). There are a few innovations in the conference this year, the most noticeable of which is the twitter channel #naacl2013 and the fact that we are the first conference to host papers published in the Transactions of the ACL journal – there are six such papers in our program, marked as [TACL]. We are very excited about our two invited talks, one on Monday morning and one Wednesday morning. The first is by Gina Kuperberg, who will talk about “Predicting Meaning: What the Brain tells us about the Architecture of Language Comprehension.” The second presenter is our own Kathleen KcKeown, who will talk about “Natural Language Applications from Fact to Fiction.” The morning session on Tuesday includes the presentation of best paper awards to two worthy recipients. The award for Best Short Paper goes to Marta Recasens, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe and Christopher Potts for their paper “The Life and Death of Discourse Entities: Identifying Singleton Mentions” The award for Best Student Paper goes to the long paper “Automatic Generation of English Respellings” by Bradley Hauer and Greg Kondrak. We gratefully acknowledge IBM’s support for the Student Best Paper Award. Finally, many thanks to the Best Paper Committee for selecting these excellent papers! The complete program includes 95 long papers (of which six represent presentations from the journal Transactions of the ACL, a first for any ACL conference!) and 51 short papers. We are excited that the conference is able to present such a dynamic array of papers, and would like to thank the authors for their great work. We worked hard to keep the conference to three parallel sessions at any one time to hopefully maximize a participant’s ability to see everything she wants! This represents an acceptance rate of 30% for long papers and 37% for short papers. More details about the distribution across areas and other statistics will be made available in the NAACL HLT Program Chair report on the ACL wiki: http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Reports The review process for the conference was double-blind, and included an author response period for clarifying reviewers’ questions. We were very pleased to have the assistance of 350 reviewers, each of whom reviewed an average of 3.7 papers, in deciding the program. We are especially thankful for the reviewers who spent time reading the author responses and engaging other reviewers in the discussion board. Assigning reviewers would not have been possible without the hard work of Mark Dredze and his miracle assignment scripts. Furthermore, constructing the program would not have been possible without 22 excellent area chairs forming the Senior Program Committee: Eugene Agichtein,</abstract>

Area chairs were responsible</degree>
<abstract confidence="0.90688352">for managing paper assignments, collating reviewer responses, handling papers for other area chairs or program chairs who had conflicts of interest, making recommendations for paper acceptance or rejection, and nominating best papers from their areas. We are very grateful for the time and energy v that they have put into the program. There are a number of other people that we interacted with who deserve a hearty thanks for the success of the program. Rich Gerber and the START team at Softconf have been invaluable for helping us with the mechanics of the reviewing process. Matt Post and Colin Cherry, as publications co-chairs, have been very helpful in assembling the final program and coordinating the publications of the workshop proceedings. There are several crucial parts of the overall program that were the responsibility of various contributors, including Annie Louis, Richard Socher, Julia Hockenmaier and Eric Ringger (Student Research Workshop chairs, who did an amazing job revamping the SRW); Jimmy Lin and Katrin Erk (Tutorial Chairs); Luke Zettlemoyer and Sujith Ravi (Workshop Chairs); Chris Dyer and Derrick Higgins (Demo Chairs); Jacob Eisenstein (Student Volunteer Coordinator); Chris Brew (Local Sponsorship Chair); Patrick Pantel and Dan Bikel (Sponsorship Chairs); and the new-founded Publicity chair who handled #naacl2013 tweeting among other things, Kristy Boyer. We would also like to thank Chris Callison-Burch and the NAACL Executive Board for guidance during the process. Michael Collins was amazingly helpful in getting the inaugural TACL papers into the NAACL HLT conference. Priscilla Rasmussen deserves, as always, special mention and warmest thanks as the local arrangements chair and general business manager. Priscilla is amazing and everyone who sees her at the conference should thank her. Finally, we would like to thank our General Chair, Lucy Vanderwende, for both her trust and guidance during this process. She helped turn the less-than-wonderful parts of this job to roses, and her ability to organize an incredibly complex event is awe inspiring. None of this would have happened without her. We hope that you enjoy the conference!</abstract>
