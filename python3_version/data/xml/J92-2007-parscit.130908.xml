The ACL Series will offer books of high quality in the field of natural
language processing, including human and machine speech production
and understanding. It will cover a wide range of topics, both theoretical
and applied, which should interest researchers not only in computational
linguistics, but also in formal linguistics.
The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, research mono-
graphs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of high quality papers
with clear unifying themes compiled under the editorship of distinguished
researchers.
The MIT Press publishes the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics. The
Press also has a strong list in formal linguistics and publishes the journal
Linguistic Inquiry.
Submissions for the ACL Series should be directed to one of the Editors,

Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are
paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most
ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for
renewals made after 1 March; this fee does not apply to new members. Students taking a full-time program of
courses and not earning a regular income qualify for a reduced rate. Institutions now subscribe to the journal
through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; +1-617-253-2889. Back issues and
proceedings are available only from the ACL Office, except that institutions should backorder journals from 1988 on
through MIT Press. An order form is on the other side of this statement. Payments for dues, back issues, and
proceedings can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S. Most Europeans should pay through Europe;
read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it is not
part of your address. Also provide telephone country &amp; city codes and computer network &amp; email address. Write

become Student Members for $15 with copy of current student ID. Students who are not Student Members and pay at
the Regular rate can still participate in student activities. Surface mailing costs are included in the membership dues.

<bodyText confidence="0.93498075">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.854535">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969762529411765">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, and Computational Phonology have been formed; others are likely to be
added.

It will cover a wide range of topics, both theoretical and applied, which should interest researchers not only in computational linguistics, but also in formal linguistics. The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, research monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of high quality papers with clear unifying themes compiled under the editorship of distinguished researchers.</abstract>
