Current Issues in Parsing Technology, edited by Masaru Tomita, contains 18 revised ver-
sions from the 45 papers that were presented at the International Workshop on Parsing
Technologies (IVVPT-89) in August 1989. (Other papers from the conference relating to
generalized LR parsing can be found in another book edited by Tomita, aptly titled
Generalized LR Parsing.) Seventeen of the contributions in the book report on imple-
mentations or formal results (e.g., theorems and proofs) associated with parsing issues,
while the first chapter is an introduction by the editor that sets the context and objec-
tive for the conference and the book. This introductory chapter also briefly summa-
rizes each of the other papers. Before discussing the common goal and commenting
on whether the reports satisfy that objective, a short sketch of each contribution is
provided.

Only the briefest and most general description is possible here. The interested reader
is referred to the book for particular findings and results of the works.
&amp;quot;The computational implementation of principle-based parsers&amp;quot; by Sandiway Fong
and Robert C. Berwick (Chapter 2) describes a principle-based (Government-Binding)
parser (Principle-Ordering Parser) and examines the effects of principle ordering with
respect to efficiency considerations.
&amp;quot;Parsing with Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar&amp;quot; by Yves Schabes and Ar-
avind K. Joshi (Chapter 3) compares parsing performance with a lexicalized grammar
(of which Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars are instances) and several parsing
strategies.

&amp;quot;Parsing with Discontinuous Phrase Structure Grammar&amp;quot; by Harry Bunt (Chapter
4) investigates the parsing of discontinuous structures using a new formalism called
Discontinuous Phrase-Structure Grammars that are extensions of Generalized or Head
Phrase Structure Grammars.
&amp;quot;Parsing with Categorical Grammar in predictive normal form&amp;quot; by Kent Witten-
burg and Robert E. Wall (Chapter 5) is a collection of formal results concerning variants
of predictive normal form of Categorical Grammars. It is shown that variants eliminate
spurious ambiguity from the parsing problem.

&amp;quot;PREMO: Parsing by conspicuous lexical consumption&amp;quot; by Brian M. Slator and
Yorick Wilks (Chapter 6) describes a knowledge-based preference semantics parser
(PREMO) that extracts and incorporates semantic information from a dictionary in the
parsing process.
&amp;quot;Parsing, word associations, and typical predicate-argument relations&amp;quot; by Ken-
neth Church, William Gale, Patrick Hanks, and Donald Hindle (Chapter 7) reports on
ways that collocational constraints can have a positive impact on syntactic processing
without resorting to semantic interpretation.
&amp;quot;Parsing spoken language using Combinatory Grammars&amp;quot; by Mark Steedman
(Chapter 8) examines relationships between intonational and syntactic structure within
a Combinatory Grammar framework.
&amp;quot;A dependency-based parser for topic and focus&amp;quot; by Eva Haji&amp;w.i. (Chapter 9)
discusses methods for parsing written &amp;quot;free word order&amp;quot; language. By employing
suprasegmental features, the techniques extend to spoken utterances.
&amp;quot;A probabilistic parsing method for sentence disambiguation&amp;quot; by T. Fujisaki, E Je-
linek, J. Cocke, E. Black, and T. Nishino (Chapter 10) reports on a probabilistic mod-
eling procedure with linguistic expertise that is capable of handling a number of lan-
guage processing problems, notably, ambiguity. Results are provided for both English
and Japanese.
&amp;quot;Towards a uniform formal framework for parsing&amp;quot; by Bernard Lang (Chapter 11)
presents formalisms for syntactic structures and parsing in order to compare compu-
tational aspects of each. Syntactic frameworks are considered special cases of Horn
clauses, whereas parsing is expressed as a pushdown automaton.
&amp;quot;A method for disjunctive constraint satisfaction&amp;quot; by John T. Maxwell III and
Ronald M. Kaplan (Chapter 12) examines the problem of processing disjunctive speci-
fications and provides an algorithm that uses locality conditions of language resulting
in better average-time performance.
&amp;quot;Polynomial parsing of extensions of context-free grammars&amp;quot; by K. Vijay-Shanker
and David J. Weir (Chapter 13) presents a general scheme for polynomial-time recog-
nition for languages generated by formalisms that are extensions of context-free gram-
mars; viz., Linear Indexed Grammar, Combinatory Categorial Grammar, and Tree Ad-
joining Grammar.
&amp;quot;Overview of parallel parsing strategies&amp;quot; by Anton Nijholt (Chapter 14) surveys
parallel parsing strategies. In addition to a discussion of multiple serial parser config-
urations, this paper examines parallel versions of CYK and Earley&apos;s algorithms.
&amp;quot;Chart parsing for loosely coupled parallel systems&amp;quot; by Henry S. Thompson
(Chapter 15) examines loosely coupled parallel systems in which the processors do
not share memory. The computation/communication impact of this design for paral-
lel parsing is explored.
&amp;quot;Parsing with connectionist networks&amp;quot; by Ajay N. Jam and Alex H. Waibel (Chap-
ter 16) reports on a connectionist system that acquires a set of grammar rules based
on a sample corpus of sentences. Speech processing is also discussed with respect to
these connectionist techniques.
&amp;quot;A broad-coverage natural language analysis system&amp;quot; by Karen Jensen (Chapter
17) presents a robust, data-driven parser. It describes a system capable of performing
syntactic and semantic analyses and paragraph modeling.
&amp;quot;Parsing 2-dimensional language&amp;quot; by Masaru Tomita (Chapter 18) introduces a
pair of two-dimensional parsing algorithms based on Earley&apos;s and Generalized LR
algorithms.

2. Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.999985163265306">
We now return to the first chapter (&amp;quot;Why parsing technologies?&amp;quot;), where Tomita
provides the objective of the conference and an insightful analysis of several issues
governing processing &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; texts. (A related discussion can be found in Tomita [19881.)
In introducing the purpose of the book, Tomita notes that while there have been many
advances in linguistics and in natural language processing, there have been very few
practical systems that utilize theories of language. In short, there is a gap between
theory and applications.
To support the view that a gap exists, Tomita distinguishes between the linguisti-
cally &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; (e.g., ambiguity and movement) and the linguistically &amp;quot;uninterest-
ing&amp;quot; constructions that are readily found in everyday language (e.g., date and time ex-
pressions and idioms). Since scientific investigations, including the study of language,
rely on abstractions and idealizations of phenomena, gaps between models and the
observables are necessary byproducts of doing science. Linguistic theory attempts to
explain the structure of language with respect to sets of assumptions or principles,
and data that are idiosyncratic or without principled underpinnings are eliminated
from examination by the abstraction process. Each theory, therefore, defines what is
or is not worthy of investigation, i.e., the phenomena that can or cannot be described
and explained by the theory, respectively. Since &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; language is a combination of
the linguistically rich and impoverished, a system that is solely grounded on a partic-
ular theory will certainly lack wide coverage and robustness. The system must then
have some mechanism to handle those aspects of language left unaccounted for by
the theory. To bridge this gap between theory and application, developers, as Tomita
indicates, have designed and implemented various techniques, including &amp;quot;efficient
parsing algorithms, software engineering for linguistic knowledge, implementation
of linguistic theories/formalisms, and stochastic/probabilistic approaches&amp;quot; (p. 1), and
the purpose of the results in this book is &amp;quot;to make contributions to fill the gap be-
tween theories and practical systems&amp;quot; (ibid.). &amp;quot;This research area, which I [Tomita] call
Parsing Technologies, is essential to bring down novel linguistic theories into practical
applications&amp;quot; (p. 3). The reports certainly do make significant contributions to pars-
ing technologies, in that the systems and techniques can handle or address a wide
set of complex language issues. There is also a diversity of approaches to language
processing ranging from those that are theory-oriented (e.g., Fong and Berwick) to
those that are primarily data-driven (e.g., Jensen). Works on parallel and connectionist
implementations (e.g., Jain and Waibel, Nijholt, and Thompson) are represented as are
probabilistic approaches (e.g., Church et al. and Fujisaki et al.). Thus, there is both
depth and breadth to the works described.
The research also permits new questions to be asked concerning syntactic issues.
For instance, Fong and Berwick have developed a system that makes possible the
investigation of computational efficiency with respect to orderings of abstract prin-
ciples. Another effort reported by Lang provides unifying frameworks for syntactic
formalisms and parsing strategies, thereby allowing various syntactic phenomena to
be compared in the same terms and divergent parsing approaches to be examined
from a common perspective. Other papers presenting formal results (e.g., Maxwell
and Kaplan, Vijay-Shanker and Weir, and Wittenburg and Wall) also provide novel in-
sights. In short, no contribution lacks technical depth and value. Let us now consider
the question of whether the goal of the book is satisfied by the various contributions.
The gap between theory and practical systems is wide, and to assess works that
purport to link the two areas we need a clearer notion of what constitutes a &amp;quot;practical
system.&amp;quot; For the purposes of this review and to remain consistent with Tomita&apos;s view, a

practical system is one that has the capability of processing &amp;quot;real text,&amp;quot; i.e., unrestricted
text. (Systems that are commercial successes or acceptable to a narrow class of trained
users do not qualify as practical ones if their input is only of a limited or restricted
nature.) In this context, the contributions fall short of the desired goal. The systems are
either weighted toward theory with little or no regard to application or developed for
broad use but without a theoretical basis. In other words, the efforts can be categorized
as falling to one or the other side of the gap, but none can be said to have succeeded in
uniting the two sides. If the papers contained in this volume are indicative of research
in parsing technology, then the vast amount of effort is clearly oriented to theoretical
issues rather than practical applications.
A system that would satisfy the seemingly incompatible goals of being theory-
based and yet capable of processing real-world texts that contain linguistically &amp;quot;unin-
teresting&amp;quot; structures could be designed in several ways. For instance, such a system
could link modules of a theory with parsing actions. (Barton [1984] is an early exam-
ple of a discussion of the interaction of parser designs and linguistic theory.) These
theory-based actions would be coupled or co-routined with a set of construction-
specific rules to handle the peripheral (&amp;quot;uninteresting&amp;quot;) aspects of language. A con-
trol module would invoke the different components as appropriate. The effect of this
dual approach to parsing is that a combination of &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;uninteresting&amp;quot;
phenomena can be processed, and as a result, the gap is bridged. (Kuhns [1990] pro-
vides a particular theory-based application and Reyle and Rohrer [1988] is a collection
of linguistic-oriented systems primarily addressing research issues from a variety of
frameworks.)
Despite what I believe is a shortcoming in that contributions fail to satisfy the
desired goal of bridging theory and application, the book, nevertheless, is an excellent
source for current parsing technology. Each paper is technically rich and presents some
aspect of parsing in a clear, detailed discussion. The book could provide supplemen-
tary reading for advanced courses on parsing issues as well as reference material for
researchers and developers working on formal syntax or parsing systems.
