<bodyText confidence="0.999848192307692">
Opinion mining is a growing research
area both at the natural language proc-
essing and the information retrieval
communities. Companies, politicians,
as well as customers need powerful
tools to track opinions, sentiments,
judgments and beliefs that people may
express in blogs, reviews, audios and
videos data regarding a prod-
uct/service/person/organisation/etc. This
work describes our contribution to fea-
ture based opinion mining where opin-
ions expressed towards each feature of
an object or a product are extracted and
summarized. The state of the art has
shown that the hierarchical organization
of features is a key step. In this context,
our goal is to study the role of a domain
ontology to structure and extract object
features as well as to produce a compre-
hensive summary. This paper presents
the developed system and the experi-
ments we carried out on a case study:
French restaurant reviews. Our results
show that our approach outperforms
standard baselines.

Opinion mining is a growing research area both
in natural language processing and information
retrieval communities. Companies, politicians,
as well as customers need powerful tools to
track opinions, sentiments, judgments and be-
liefs that people may express in blogs, reviews,
audios and videos data regarding a prod-
uct/service/person/organisation/etc. The impor-
tance of emotion-oriented computing in the
Web 2.0 has encouraged the creation of new
search engines (like Tweetfeel
(www.tweetfeel.com)) as well as the creation of
a new research group within the W3C, namely
the Emotion Markup Language, that aims to
develop a representation language of the emo-
tional states of a user or the emotional states to
be simulated by a user interface. In addition,
most information retrieval evaluation campaigns
(TREC, NTCI, etc.) have already integrated an
opinion track.
Computational approaches to sentiment analysis
focus on extracting the affective content of a
text from the detection of expressions of “bag of
sentiment words” at different levels of granular-
ity. These expressions are assigned a positive or
a negative scalar value, representing a positive,
a negative or neutral sentiment towards some
topic. Roughly, research in this field can be
grouped in four main categories (which are not
exclusive):

et al., 2005; Cheng and Xu, 2008) where
opinions expressed towards the features of
an object or a product are exacted and
summarized.
The work described in this paper feats into the
last category. The aim is not to compute the
general orientation of a document or a sentence,
since a positive sentiment towards an object
does not imply a positive sentiment towards all
the aspects of this object, as in: I like this res-
taurant even if the service is slow. In feature
based opinion mining, a holder (the person who
posts the review) expresses a positive/negative
or neutral opinions towards a main topic (the
object or the product on which the holder ex-
presses his opinions) and its associated features.
As defined in (Hu and Liu, 2004), a feature can
be a “part-of” of a topic (such as the screen of a
camera) or a property of the “part-of” of the
topic (such as the size of the screen). The ex-
pressed opinion can be explicit, as in “the
screen of this camera is great”, or implicit, as in
“the camera is heavy”, that expresses a negative
opinion towards the weight of the camera. Same
features can also be expressed differently, for
example, “drink” and “beverage” refer to the
same restaurant feature.
Having, for an object/product, the set of its as-
sociated features F={f1,...fn}, research in fea-
ture based opinion mining mostly focus on
extracting the set F from reviews, and then, for
each feature fi of F, extract the set of its associ-
ated opinion expressions OE={OE1,...OEj}.
Once the set of couples (fi, OE) were extracted,
a summary of the review is generally produced.
During this process, the key questions are: how
the set F of features can be obtained? How they
are linguistically expressed? How they are re-
lated to each other ? Which knowledge repre-
sentation model can be used to better organize
product features and to produce a comprehen-
sive summary?
To answer these questions, we propose in this
paper to study the role of an ontology in feature
based opinion mining. More precisely, our aim
is to study how a domain ontology can be used
to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.908958066666667">
• structure features: we show that an ontol-
ogy is more suitable than a simple hierarchy
where features are grouped using only the
“is-a” relation (Carenini et al., 2005; Blair-
Goldensohn et al., 2008)
• extract explicit and implicit features from
texts: we show how the lexical component
as well as the set of properties of the ontol-
ogy can help to extract, for each feature, the
set of the associated opinion expressions.
• produce a discourse based summary of the
review: we show how the ontology can
guide the process of identifying the most
relevant discourse relations that may hold
between elementary discourse units.

2 Feature based Opinion mining
2.1 Related Works
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99502925">
Overall, two main families of work stand out:
those that extract a simple list of features and
those that organize them into a hierarchy using
taxonomies or ontologys. The feature extraction
process mainly concerns explicit features.
Works without knowledge representation
models : The pioneer work in feature based
opinion mining is probably the one of Hu and
Liu (2004) that applies association rule mining
algorithm to discover product features (nouns
and noun-phrases). Heuristics (frequency of
occurrence, proximity with opinion words,
etc...) can eliminate irrelevant candidates. Opin-
ion expressions (only adjective phrases) which
are the closest to these features are extracted. A
summary is then produced and displays, for
each feature, both positive and negative phrases
and the total number of these two categories.
To improve the feature extraction phase, Pope-
scu and Etzioni (2005) suggest in their system
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996772">
78
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999573019607843">
OPINE, to extract only nominal groups whose
frequency is above a threshold determined ex-
perimentally using the calculation of PMI
(Point-wise Mutual Information) between each
of these nouns and meronymy expressions asso-
ciated with the product. No summary is pro-
duced.
The main limitation of these approaches is that
there are a great many extracted features and
there is a lack of organization. Thus, similar
features are not grouped together (for example,
in restaurant domain, “atmosphere” and “ambi-
ence”), and possible relationships between fea-
tures of an object are not recognized (for exam-
ple, “coffee” is a specific term for “drink”). In
addition, polarity analysis (positive, negative or
neutral) of the document is done by assigning
the dominant polarity of opinion words it con-
tains (usually adjectives), regardless of polari-
ties individually associated to each feature.
Works using feature taxonomies. Following
works have a different approach: they do not
look for a “basic list” of features but rather a list
hierarchically organized through the use of tax-
onomies. We recall that a taxonomy is a list of
terms organized hierarchically through speciali-
zation relationship type “is a sort of”.
Carenini et al. (2005) use predefined taxono-
mies and semantic similarity measures to auto-
matically extract classic features of a product
and calculate how close to predefined concepts
in the taxonomy they are. This is reviewed by
the user in order to insert missing concepts in
the right place while avoiding duplication. The
steps of identifying opinions and their polarity
and the production of a summary are not de-
tailed. This method was evaluated on the prod-
uct review corpus of Hu and Liu (2004) and
resulted in a significant reduction in the number
of extracted features. However, this method is
very dependent on the effectiveness of similar-
ity measures used.
In their system PULSE, Gamon et al. (2005)
analyze a large amount of text contained in a
database. A taxonomy, including brands and
models of cars, is automatically extracted from
the database. Coupled with a classification
technique, sentences corresponding to each leaf
of the taxonomy are extracted. At the end of the
process, a summary which can be more or less
detailed is produced.
The system described in (Blair-Goldensohn et
al., 2008) extracts information about services,
aggregates the sentiments expressed on every
aspect and produces a summary. The automatic
feature extraction combines a dynamic method,
where the different aspects of services are the
most common nouns, and a static method,
where a taxonomy grouping the concepts con-
sidered to be the most relevant by the user is
used to manually annotate sentences. The re-
sults also showed that the use of a hierarchy
significantly improves the quality of extracted
features.
Works using ontologys. These works aim at
organizing features using a more elaborated
model of representation: an ontology Unlike
taxonomy, ontology is not restricted to a hierar-
chical relationship between concepts, but can
describe other types of paradigmatic relations
such as synonymy, or more complex relation-
ships such as composition relationship or space
relationship.
Overall, extracted features correspond exclu-
sively to terms contained in the ontology. The
feature extraction phase is guided by a domain
ontology, built manually (Zhao and Li, 2009),
or semi-automatically (Feiguina, 2006; Cheng
and Xu, 2008), which is then enriched by an
automatic process of extraction / clustering of
terms which corresponds to new feature identi-
fication.
To extract terms, Feiguina (2006) uses pattern
extraction coupled to a terminology extractor
trained over a set of features related to a product
and identified manually in a few reviews. Same
features are grouped together using semantic
similarity measures. The system OMINE
(Cheng and Xu, 2008) proposes a mechanism
for ontology enrichment using a domain glos-
sary which includes specific terms such as
words of jargon, abbreviations and acronyms.
Zhao and Li (2009) add to their ontology con-
cepts using a corpus based method: sentences
containing a combination of conjunction word
and already recognized concept are extracted.
This process is repeated iteratively until no new
concepts are found.
Ontologys have also been used to support polar-
ity mining. For example, (Chaovalit and Zhou,
2008) manually built an ontology for movie re-
views and incorporated it into the polarity clas-

sification task which significantly improve per-
formance over standard baseline.
2.2 Towards an ontology based opinion
mining
Most of the researchers actually argue that
the use of a hierarchy of features improves the
performance of feature based opinion mining
systems. However, works that actually use a
domain ontology (cf. last section) exploit the
ontology as a taxonomy using only the is-a rela-
tion between concepts. They do not really use
all data stored in an ontology, such as the lexical
components and other types of relations. In ad-
dition, in our knowledge, no work has investi-
gated the use of an ontology to produce com-
prehensive summaries.
We think there is still room for improvement
in the field of feature based sentiment analysis.
To get an accurate appraisal of opinion in texts,
it is important for NLP systems to go beyond
explicit features and to propose a fine-grained
analysis of opinions expressed towards each
feature. Our intuition is that the full use of on-
tology would have several advantages in the
domain of opinion mining to:
Structure features: ontologys are tools that
provide a lot of semantic information. They help
to define concepts, relationships and entities
that describe a domain with unlimited number
of terms. This set of terms can be a significant
and valuable lexical resource for extracting ex-
plicit and implicit features. For example, in the
following restaurant review: cold and not tasty
the negative opinion not tasty is ambiguous
since it is not associated to any lexicalised fea-
ture. However, if the term cold is stored in the
ontology as a lexical realization of the concept
quality of the cuisine, the opinion not tasty can
be easily associated to the feature cuisine of the
restaurant (note that the conjunction and plays
an important role in the desambiguisation proc-
ess). We discuss this point at the last section of
the paper.
Extract features: ontologys provide structure
for these features through their concept hierar-
chy but also their ability to define many rela-
tions linking these concepts. This is also a valu-
able resource for structuring the knowledge ob-
tained during feature extraction task. In addi-
tion, the relations between concepts and lexical
information can be used to extract implicit fea-
tures. For example, if the concept customer is
linked to the concept restaurant by the relation
to eat in, a positive opinion towards the restau-
rant can be extracted from the review: we eat
well. Similarly, if the concept restaurant is
linked to the concept landscape with the rela-
tion to view, a positive opinion can be extracted
towards the look out of the restaurant from the
following review: very good restaurant where
you can savour excellent Gratin Dauphinois
and admire the most beautiful peak of the Pyré-
nées
Produce summaries. Finally, we also believe
that ontologys can play a fundamental role to
produce well organised summary and discursive
representation of the review. We further detail
this point at the last section of the paper.

3 Our approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993535">
Our feature based opinion mining system needs
three basic components: a lexical resource L of
opinion expressions, a lexical ontology O where
each concept and each property is associated to
a set of labels that correspond to their linguistic
realizations and a review R.
Following the idea described in (Asher et al,
2009), a review R is composed of a set of ele-
mentary discourse units (EDU). Using the dis-
course theory SDRT (Asher and Lascarides
2003) as our formal framework, an EDU is a
clause containing at least one elementary opin-
ion unit (EOU) or a sequence of clauses that
together bear a rhetorical relation to a segment
expressing an opinion. An EOU is an explicit
opinion expression composed of a noun, an ad-
jective or a verb with its possible modifiers (ac-
tually negation and adverb) as described in our
lexicon L.
We have segmented conjoined NPs or APs
into separate clauses—for instance, the film is
beautiful and powerful is taken to express two
segments: the film is beautiful and the film is
powerful. Segments are then connected to each
other using a small subset of “veridical” dis-
course relations, namely:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9749545">

of one that is contradicted by the other. Pos-
sible markers can be although, but.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.917340647058823">
• Result(a,b) indicated by markers like so, as
a result, indicates that the EDU b is a con-
sequence or result of the EDU a.
• Continuation(a,b ) corresponds to a series
of speeches in which there are no time con-
straints and where segments form part of a
larger thematic. For example, &amp;quot;The average
life expectancy in France is 81 years. In
Andorra, it reaches over 83 years. In Swazi-
land it does not exceed 85 years.&amp;quot;
• Elaboration(a,b) describes global informa-
tion that was stated previously with more
specific information. For example, &amp;quot;Yester-
day, I spent a wonderful day. I lounged in
the sun all morning. I ate in a nice little res-
taurant. Then at night, I met my friend Emi-
ly.&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992363333333333">
In a review R, an opinion holder h comments
on a subset S of the features of an ob-
ject/product using some opinion expressions.
Each feature corresponds to the set of linguistic
realizations of a concept or a property of the
domain ontology O. For example, in the follow-
ing product review, EDUs are between square
brackets, EOUs are between embraces whereas
object features are underlined. There is a
contrast relation between the EDUb and EDUc
which makes up the opinion expressed within
the EDUd.
[I bought the product yesterday] a. [Even if the
product is {excellent}]b, [the design and the size
are {very basic}] c, [which is {disappointing}
in this brand] c.
The figure below gives an overview of our sys-
tem. First, each review R is parsed using the
French syntactic parser Cordial1, which pro-
vides, for each sentence, its POS tagging and
the set of dependency relations. The review is
then segmented in EDUs using the discourse
parser described in (Afantenos and al, 2010).
For each EDU, the system :

Since the summarization module is not done
yet, we detail below the three first steps.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999413">
3.1 Extracting Elementary Opinion Units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948076923077">
We recall that an EOU is the smallest opinion
unit within an EDU. It is composed of one and
only one opinion word (a noun, an adjective or a
verb) possibly associated with some modifiers
like negation words and adverbs. For example,
“really not good” is an EOU. An EOU can also
be simply an adverb as in too spicy. Adverbs are
also used to update our opinion lexicon, as in
too chic where the opinion word chic is added.
Finally, we also extract expressions of recom-
mendation, such as : go to this restaurant, you
will not regret it, which are very frequent in
reviews.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999301">
3.2 Extracting features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998977428571429">
This step aims at extracting for the review all
the labels of the ontology. Since each concept
and its associated lexical realizations corre-
spond to explicit features, we simply project the
lexical component of the ontology in the review
in order to get, for each EDU, the set of features
F. Of course, since our lexical ontology does not

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999363">
cover all the linguistic realizations of concepts
and properties in a given domain, many terms in
the review can be missed. We show, in the next
section, that linking features to opinion expres-
sions can partially solve this problem.
To extract implicit features, ontology proper-
ties are used. We recall that these properties
define relations between concepts of the ontol-
ogy. For example, the property “look at” links
“customer” and “design” concepts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.960262">
3.3 Associating opinions expressions to
extracted features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99742772881356">
In this step, the extracted opinion expressions in
step 1 have to be linked to the features extracted
in step 2 i.e. we have to associate to each EDUi
the set of couples (fi, OEi). During this step, we
distinguish the following cases :
Case 1. Known features and known opinion
words. For example, if the lexicon contains the
words really, good and excellent and the ontol-
ogy contains the terms eating place and food as
a linguistic realization of the concepts restau-
rant and food, then this step allows the extrac-
tion from the EDU “really good restaurant with
excellent food” the couples (restaurant, really
good) and (food, excellent). This example is
quite simple but in many cases, features and
opinion words are not close to each other which
make the link difficult to find. Actually, our
system deals with conjunctions (including co-
mas) as in: “I recommend pizzas and ice
“very good restaurant but very expen-
sive”
Case 2. Known features and unknown opinion
expressions, as in the EDU “acceptable prices”
where the opinion word acceptable has not been
extracted in step 1 (cf. section 3.1). In this case,
the opinion lexicon can be automatically up-
dated with the retrieved opinion word.
Case 3. Unknown features and known opinion
expressions, as in the EDU “old fashion restau-
rant” where the features fashion has not been
extracted in step 2 (cf. section 3.2). In this case,
the domain ontology can be updated by adding a
new label to an existing concept or property or
by adding a new concept or a new property in
the right place to the ontology. However, since a
user may express an opinion on different objects
within a review, this step has to be done care-
fully. To avoid errors, we propose to manually
update the ontology.
Case 4. Opinion expressions alone, as in the
EDU “It’s slow, cold and not good”. This kind
of EDU expresses an implicit feature. In this
case, we use the ontology properties in order to
retrieve the associated concept in the ontology.
For example, in the sentence “we eat very well”,
the property “eat” of the ontology which links
“customer” and “food” will allow the system to
determine that “very well” refers to “food”.
Case S. Features alone, as in the EDU: “Nice
surrounding on sunny days with terrace”, even
if the feature “terrace” is not associated to any
opinion word, it is important to extract this in-
formation because it gives a positive opinion
towards the restaurant. An EDU with features
alone can also be an indicator of the presence of
an implicit opinion expression towards the fea-
ture as in this restaurant is a nest of tourists
Actually, our system deals with all these cases
except the last one.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988541666667">
Since our aim is to study the role of a domain
ontology to feature based opinion mining, we
choose to reuse an existing ontology. However,
for the restaurant domain, we do not find any
public available ontology for French. We thus
use a pre-existent ontology3 for English as a
basis coupled with additional information that
we gather from several web sites4 . We first
translate the existing ontology to French and
then adapt it to our application by manually re-
organize, add and delete concepts in order to
describe important restaurant features. Dispari-
ties between our ontology and the one we found
in the web mainly come from cultural consid-
erations. For example, we do not found in the
English ontology concepts like terrace.
Our domain ontology has been implemented
under Protégé5 and actually contains 239 con-
cepts (from which we have 14 concepts directly
related to the superclass owl:think), 36 object
properties and 703 labels (646 labels for con-
cepts and 57 labels for properties). The left part
of figure 3 shows an extract of our restaurant

where POS is the part of speech tagging of the
term, opinion category can be a judgment, a
sentiment or an advice (see (Asher et al, 2009)
for a detailed description of these categories),
polarity and strength corresponds respectively
to the opinion orientation (positive, negative
and neutral) and the opinion strength (a score
between 0 and 2). For example, we have the
following entry for the term good: [Adj, judg-
ment, +, 1].

The lexicon actually contains 222 adjectives,
152 nouns, 157 verbs. It is automatically built
following the algorithm described in (Chardon,
2010). We then add manually to this lexicon 98
adverbs and 15 expressions of negation.

4.4 Experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982093304347826">
We conduct three types of experiment: the
evaluation of the extraction of elementary opin-
ion units (cf. section 3.1), the evaluation of the
features extraction step (cf. section 3.2) and fi-
nally, the evaluation of the link between the re-
trieved opinion expressions and the retrieved
object features (cf. section 3.3).
These experiments are carried out using
GATE6 toolkit. To evaluate our system, we
create a gold standard by manually annotate in
the corpus implicit and explicit elementary
opinion units, implicit and explicit object fea-
tures as well as for each opinion expression its
associated feature.
Evaluation of the EOU extraction step.
The table below shows our results. Our system
misses some EOU for two main reasons. The
first one is due to missed opinion words in the
lexicon and to implicit opinion expressions,
such as breathtaking, since our extraction rules
do not manage these cases (note that implicit
opinion detection is still an open research prob-
lem in opinion mining).

The second reason is the errors that come from
the syntactic parser mainly because of typos and
dependency link errors. Concerning precision,
false positives are mainly due to some opinion
words that are in our lexicon but they do not
express opinions in the restaurant domain. In
addition, some of our extraction rules, espe-
cially those that extract expression of recom-
mendations, do not perform very well which
imply a loss of precision.

Evaluation of the features extraction step.
Since the corpus is in the restaurant domain, the
precision of this task is very good because most
of the extracted features are relevant. However,
recall is not as good as precision because the set
of ontology labels do not totally cover the terms
of the corpus. Another limitation of our system
is that we do not take into account the cases
where a term can be a linguistic realization of
many concepts (ex. café can be a drink or a
place to drink).
Figure 4 shows an example of the result we ob-
tain for this step.

Evaluation of the link between EOU and fea-
tures.
The figure below shows our result on a sample.
In this example, the system is able to extract
opinion expressions which do not contain words
present in the lexicon. It is the case with “sympa
(nice)” which has been correctly associated to
“resto (restaurant)” and “deco (interior de-
sign)” even if the word nice was not in the lexi-
con.
In order to evaluate the added value of using an
ontology to feature based opinion mining, we
compare our system to the well known ap-
proaches of Hu and Liu and Popescu and Etzi-
oni (cf. section 2.1) that do not use any knowl-
edge representation. We have also compared
our approach to those that use taxonomies of
concepts by deleting the properties of our do-
main ontology. The results are shown in table 2.

In the Hu and Liu approach, features are nomi-
nal groups. We first extract all frequent features
from our corpus that appear in more than 1% of
the sentences. Then we extract EOU from those
sentences (note that contrary to Hu and Liu, we
do not extract only adjectives, but also nouns,
verbs and adverbs). Non frequent features are
finally removed as described in (Hu and Liu,
2004). In order to improve the extraction of
relevant features, we extract features that have a
good point mutual information value with the
word restaurant, as described in (Popescu and
Etzioni, 2005). The precision of our system is
better compared to the approach of Hu and Liu
that extracts too many irrelevant features (such
as any doubt, whole word). Our system is also
better compared to the PMI approach even if it
performs better than Hu and Liu’s approach.
Recall is also better because our system can ex-
tract implicit features such as well eating, lot of
noise, thanks to the use of ontology properties.
Finally, when using only taxonomy of concepts
instead of the ontology, we observe that the F-
measure is slightly better because actually fea-

tures related to object properties represent only
1,6% of feature cases in our corpus. Using, the
ontology, our approach is able to extract from
sentences like &amp;quot;we eat good and healthy&amp;quot; the
couples (eat, good) and (eat, healthy) and then
to link the opinion expressions to the concept
dish whereas when using only the taxonomy,
these opinion expressions are related to any fea-
ture.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998553">
5.1 Contribution of our system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988538461538">
Our method is promising because the use of the
ontology allows to improve the feature extrac-
tion and the association between an opinion ex-
pressions and object features. On the one hand,
the ontology is useful thanks to its concept list
which brings a lot of semantic data in the sys-
tem. Using concept labels the ontology allows
to recognize terms which refer to the same con-
cepts and brings some hierarchy between these
concepts. On the other hand, the ontology is
useful thanks to its list of properties between
concepts which allows recognizing some opin-
ions expressed about implicit features.

5.2 Prospects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986920984615385">
Opinion lexicon improvement.
The opinion extraction we achieved is naive
because we use a simple opinion word lexicon
which is not perfectly adapted to the domain. To
improve this part of the treatment, it would be
interesting to use opinion ontology. As illus-
trated in section 2.2, constructing a domain on-
tology for the purpose of opinion mining poses
several interesting questions in term of knowl-
edge representation, such as: what are the fron-
tiers between knowledge, where concepts are
domain dependent, and opinion, where expres-
sions can be at the same time dependent (the
term long can be positive for a battery life but
negative if it refers to a the service of a restau-
rant) and independent (the term good is posi-
tive) from a domain. Our intuition is that the
two levels have to be separated as possible.
Natural Language processing (NLP) rules
improvement.
Our system is limited by some current NLP
problems. For example, the system does not
treat the anaphora. For example, in the sentence
“Pizzas are great. They are tasty, original and
generous”, it does not recognize that the three
last adjectives refer to “pizzas”. There is also
the problem of conditional proposition. For ex-
ample, in the sentence “affordable prices if you
have a fat wallet”, the system is not able to de-
termine that “affordable prices” is subject to a
condition.
Ontology and lexicon enrichment.
Thanks to the ability to link opinion expression
and ontological term extractions, our system is
able to extract some missing opinion words and
labels of the ontology. We think it could be in-
teresting to implement a module which allows
the user to easily enrich opinion word lexicon
and ontology. Furthermore, it will be interesting
to evaluate the benefit of this method in both
opinion mining and ontological domains.
Towards a discourse based summary.
The last step of the system is to produce a sum-
mary of the review that presents to the user all
the opinion expressions associated to the main
topic and all its features. This summary does not
pretend to aggregate opinions for each feature
or for the global topic. Instead, the aim is to or-
ganize the opinions of several reviews about
one restaurant in order to allow the user to
choose what feature is important or not for him.
In addition to this kind of summarization, we
want to investigate how the domain ontology
can be used to guide the process of identifying
the most relevant discourse relations between
elementary discourse units (EDU). Actually,
the automatic identification of discourse rela-
tions that hold between EDUs is still an open
research problem. Our idea is that there is con-
tinuation relation between EDU that contain
terms that refer to concepts which are at the
same level of the ontology hierarchy, and there
is an elaboration relation when EDU contains
more specific concepts than those of the previ-
ous clause.

<abstract confidence="0.999296703703703">Opinion mining is a growing research area both at the natural language processing and the information retrieval communities. Companies, politicians, as well as customers need powerful tools to track opinions, sentiments, judgments and beliefs that people may express in blogs, reviews, audios and videos data regarding a product/service/person/organisation/etc. This work describes our contribution to feature based opinion mining where opinions expressed towards each feature of an object or a product are extracted and summarized. The state of the art has shown that the hierarchical organization of features is a key step. In this context, our goal is to study the role of a domain ontology to structure and extract object features as well as to produce a comprehensive summary. This paper presents the developed system and the experiments we carried out on a case study: French restaurant reviews. Our results show that our approach outperforms standard baselines.</abstract>

These expressions are assigned a positive or a negative scalar value, representing a positive, a negative or neutral sentiment towards some topic. Roughly, research in this field can be grouped in four main categories (which are not exclusive): • Development of linguistic and cognitive models of opinion/sentiment where already existing psycholinguistic theories of emotions are used to analyse how opinions are lexically expressed in texts (Wiebe et al, 2005; Read et al, 2007; Asher et al, 2009) • Elaboration of linguistic resources where corpus based and dictionary based approaches are used to automatically or semiautomatically extract opinion bearing terms/expressions as well as their sentiment orientation (Strapparava et al., 2004; Turney and Littman, 2002) • Opinion extraction/analysis at the document (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002), at the sentence or at the clause level (Kim et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2005) where local 77 Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Ontologies and Lexical Resources (Ontolex 2010), pages 77–86, Beijing, August 2010 opinions are aggregated in order to co</context>

Finally, we also believe that ontologys can play a fundamental role to produce well organised summary and discursive representation of the review. We further detail this point at the last section of the paper. 3 Our approach Our feature based opinion mining system needs three basic components: a lexical resource L of opinion expressions, a lexical ontology O where each concept and each property is associated to a set of labels that correspond to their linguistic realizations and a review R. Following the idea described in (Asher et al, 2009), a review R is composed of a set of elementary discourse units (EDU). Using the discourse theory SDRT (Asher and Lascarides 2003) as our formal framework, an EDU is a clause containing at least one elementary opinion unit (EOU) or a sequence of clauses that together bear a rhetorical relation to a segment expressing an opinion. An EOU is an explicit opinion expression composed of a noun, an adjective or a verb with its possible modifiers (actually negation and adverb) as described in our lexicon L. We have segmented conjoined NPs or APs into separate clauses—for instance, the film is beautifu</context>

The left part of figure 3 shows an extract of our restaurant domain ontology. 4.3 Opinion Lexicon Our lexicon contains a list of opinion terms where each lexical entry is of the form: [POS, opinion category, polarity, strength] where POS is the part of speech tagging of the term, opinion category can be a judgment, a sentiment or an advice (see (Asher et al, 2009) for a detailed description of these categories), polarity and strength corresponds respectively to the opinion orientation (positive, negative and neutral) and the opinion strength (a score between 0 and 2).

In addition, polarity analysis (positive, negative or neutral) of the document is done by assigning the dominant polarity of opinion words it contains (usually adjectives), regardless of polarities individually associated to each feature. Works using feature taxonomies. Following works have a different approach: they do not look for a “basic list” of features but rather a list hierarchically organized through the use of taxonomies. We recall that a taxonomy is a list of terms organized hierarchically through specialization relationship type “is a sort of”. Carenini et al. (2005) use predefined taxonomies and semantic similarity measures to automatically extract classic features of a product and calculate how close to predefined concepts in the taxonomy they are. This is reviewed by the user in order to insert missing concepts in the right place while avoiding duplication. The steps of identifying opinions and their polarity and the production of a summary are not detailed.

The feature extraction process mainly concerns explicit features. Works without knowledge representation models : The pioneer work in feature based opinion mining is probably the one of Hu and Liu (2004) that applies association rule mining algorithm to discover product features (nouns and noun-phrases). Heuristics (frequency of occurrence, proximity with opinion words, etc...) can eliminate irrelevant candidates. Opinion expressions (only adjective phrases) which are the closest to these features are extracted. A summary is then produced and displays, for each feature, both positive and negative phrases and the total number of these two categories. To improve the feature extraction phase, Popescu and Etzioni (2005) suggest in their system 78 OPINE, to extract only nominal groups whose freque</context>

Evaluation of our system and its comparison to existing approaches In the Hu and Liu approach, features are nominal groups. We first extract all frequent features from our corpus that appear in more than 1% of the sentences. Then we extract EOU from those sentences (note that contrary to Hu and Liu, we do not extract only adjectives, but also nouns, verbs and adverbs). Non frequent features are finally removed as described in (Hu and Liu, 2004). In order to improve the extraction of relevant features, we extract features that have a good point mutual information value with the word restaurant, as described in (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005). The precision of our system is better compared to the approach of Hu and Liu that extracts too many irrelevant features (such as any doubt, whole word). Our system is also better compared to the PMI approach even if it performs better than Hu and Liu’s approach. Recall is also better because our system can extract implicit features such as well eating, lot of noise, thanks to the use of ontology pro</context>
