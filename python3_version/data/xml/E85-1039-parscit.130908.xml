ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.992414781250001">
The purpose of the paper is (i) to
substantiate the claim that the output
of an automatic analysis should represent
among other things also the hierarchy of
topic-focus articulation, and (ii) to
present a general procedure for determin-
ing the topic-focus articulation in Czech
and English.
(i) The following requirements on the
output of an automatic analysis are
significant:
(a) in the output of the analysis it
should be marked which elements of the
analyzed sentence belong to its topic and
which to the focus;
(b) the scale of communicative dynamism
(CD) should also be identified for every
representation of a meaning of the analy-
zed sentence, since the degrees of CD
correspond to the unmarked distribution
of quantifier scopes in the semantic
interpretation of the sentence;
(c) the analysis should also distinguish
topicless sentences from those having
a topic, which is relevant for the scope
of negation.
(ii) For an automatic recognition of
topic, focus and the degrees of CD, two
points are crucial:
(a) either the input language has
(a considerable degree of) the so-called
free word order (as in Czech, Russian),
or its word order is determined mainly
by the grammatical relations (as in
English, French):
(b) either the input is spoken discourse
(and the recognition procedure includes
an acoustic analysis), or written (print-
ed) texts are analyzed.
In accordance with these points,
a general procedure for determining
topic, focus and the degrees of CD is
formulated for Czech and English, with
some hints how the preceding context
can be taken into account.
1. We distinguish between the level
of linguistic,meaning (de Saussure s
and Hje;mslev s &amp;quot;form of content&amp;quot;,
Cosieru s &amp;quot;Bedeutung&amp;quot;, others &amp;quot;literal
meaning&amp;quot;) and its interpretation in the
sense of truth-conditional, intensional
logic (see Materna and Sgall, 1980;
Sgall, 1983).
For some purposes of automatic treat-
ment of natural language (including
machine translation) it is sufficient
if the output of the procedure of
analysis is more or less identical with
the representation of the (linguistic)
meaning of the sentence. For other
purposes, such as that of full natural
language comprehension, it is necessary
to go as far as the semantic (truth-
-conditional) interpretation, using
a notation that includes variables,
operators, parentheses and similar means.
The topic-focus articulation (TPA) is
understood as one of the hierarchies of
the level of meaning, whose other two
hierarchies are that of dependency syn-
tax (close to case grammar) and that of
coordination (and apposition) relations.
The basic task of a description of TFA
is to handle the differences between
such sentences as John gave Mary a BOOK.

representation of one of the meanings
shared by the sentences in which the
intonation center is placed on BOOK;
Fig. 2 corresponds to one of th-g-Fgan-
lags shared by the sentences with the
intonation center on MARY.
The following requirements on the
output of an automatic analysis are
significant, whatever approach to the
description of the structure of the
sentence has been chosen:
a) In the output of the analysis it
should be marked which elements of the
analyzed sentence belong to its topic

Note that in (1) the verb as well as
the Addressee belong to the focus in some
of the readines, while in others they are
included in the topic; in (5) the Addres-
see belongs to the focus and Objective to
the topic in all readings, only the pos-
ition of the verb here being ambiguous
(this can be checked by tests including
negation and by the question test, see
Sgall et al., 1973).
b) The scale of communicative dynamism
or CD (ibid.) should also be identified
for every representation of a meaning
(underlying structure, etc.) of the ana-
lyzed sentence, since the degrees of CD
correspond to the unmarked distribution
of quantifier scopes in the semantic in-
terpretation of the sentence; thus in (1)
and (6)the Addressee includes a quantifi-
er with a wider scope than that of the
Objective (on the primary reading), while
in (5) and (7) the quantifier of the Ob-
jective includes the Addressee in its
scope:

girls about many problems.

problems to few girls.

relevant for the scope of negation: only

English this ordering is Time - Actor -
- Addressee - Objective - Origin - Ef-
fect - Manner - Instrument - Locative
(see Seidlova, 1983). The scale of CD
differs from this ordering only if at
least one of the elements in question be-
longs to the topic (this is true about
the Addressee in (10)(b),about the Origin
in (11)(b), and about the Effect in (12)

<bodyText confidence="0.994489817307692">
Thus, in the (b) sentences a few ap-
ples, a log and a canoe are contextually
biidrid, standing close toa few of those
apples, one of the logs, the canoe we
spoke about, respectively. In the la) ex-
amples the rightmost complementations be-
long to the focus (they carry the intona-
tion center`, while the complementations
standing between them and the verb are
ambiguous in this respect: in some mean-
ings of the sentence they are contextual-
ly bound and belong to the focus; a simi-
lar ambiguity concerns also the verbs in
all the examples.
Systemic ordering is language specific;
Czech differs from English e.g. in that
it has Time after Actor and Object after
Instrument; for more details, see Sgall,
Haji6ovA and Panevovi (in press, Chapter
3).
3.1 For an automatic recognition of
topic, focus and the degrees of CD, two
points are crucial:
(A) Either the input is spoken dis-
course (and the recognition procedure in-
cludes an acoustic analysis), or written
(printed) texts are analyzed.
(B) Either the input language has
(a considerable degree of the so-called
free word order (as in Czech, Russian),
or its word order is determined mainly by
the grammatical relations (as in English,
French).
Since written texts do not indicate
the position of the intonation center and
since the &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order is determin-
ed first of all by the scale of CD, it is
evident that the &amp;quot;either&amp;quot; cases in (A) .
and (B) do not present so many difficult-
ies for the recognition procedure as the
&amp;quot;or&amp;quot; cases do.
A written &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; corresponds, in
general, to several spoken sentences
which differ in the placement of their
intonation center. Thus, if an adverbial
of time or of place stands at the end of
the sentence, as in (13), then at least
two sentences may be present, see (14)(a)
and (b), where the intonation center is
marked by the capitals;the TFA clearly
differs:
(13) We were swimming in the pool in
the afternoon.
(14)(a) We were swimming in the pool
in the AFTERNOON.
(b) We were swimming in the POOL
in the afternoon.
In languages with the so-called free
word order this fact does not bring about
serious complications with technical
texts, since there is a strong tendency
to arrange the words so that the intona-
tion center falls on the last word of the
sentence (if this is not enclitical).
3.2 A procedure for the identification
of topic and focus in Czech. written
(first of all technical)texts can then
be formulated as follows:1
(i)(a) If the verb is the last word
of the surface shape of the
sentence (SS), it always be-
longs to the focus.
(b) If the verb is not the last
word of the SS, it belongs
either to the topic, or to the
focus.
Note: The ambiguity accounted for by the
rule (i)(b) can be partially resolved
(esp. for the purposes of practical
systems) on the basis of the features of
the preceding sentence: if the verb V of
the analyzed sentence is identical with
the verb of the preceding sentence, or
if a relation of synonymy or inclusion
holds between the two verbs, then V be-
longs to the topic. Also, a semantically
weak, general verb, such as to be,
to become, to carry out, can ITithderstood
as belong to the topic. In other
cases the primary position of the verb is
in the focus.
(ii) The complementations preceding
the verb are included in the
topic.
(iii) As for the complementations fol-
lowing the verb, the boundary
1The term complementation (sentence
part) is used in the sense of a subtree
occupying the position of a deep case or
an adverbial. - we disregard the so-call-
ed subjective order here, since (in
contrast to English) in a Czech written
technical text such sentences as
The SWITCH was off are extremely rare.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.993359873563219">
between topic (to the left) and
focus (to the right) may be
drawn between any two complemen-
tations, provided that those be-
longing to the focus are arrang-
ed in the surface word order in
accordance with the systemic
ordering.
(iv) If the sentence contains
then in astin4imary
case the complementation follow-
ing the rhematizer belongs to the
focus and the rest of the sent-
ence belongs to the topic.2
3.22 Similar regularities hold for the
analysis of spoken sentences with normal
intonation. However, if a non-final
complementation carries the intonation
center (IC), then
(a) the bearer of the IC belongs to
the focus and all the complement-
ations standing after IC belong
to the topic;
(b) rules (ii) and (iii) apply for the
elements standing before the bear-
er of the intonation center;
(c) the rule (i)(b) is applied to the
verb (if it does not carry
the IC).3
3.31 As for the identification of
topic and focus in an English written
sentence, the situation is more complic-
ated due to the fact that the surface
word order is to a great extent determin-
ed by rules of grammar, so that intona-
tion plays a more substantial role and
the written form of the sentence displays
much richer ambiguity. For English texts
from polytechnical and scientific domains
the rules stated for Czech in 3.21 should
be modified in the following ways:
(i)(a) holds the surface subject
of the sentence is a definite
NP; if the subject noun has

used; in a secondary case the rhematizer
may occur in the topic, e.g. if the
sentence part in its scope is repeated
from the preceding co-text.
31Iowever, an analysis of spoken dis-
course should pay due respect not only
to the preceding co-text, but also to the
situation of the utterance, i.e. to its
context in the broader sense.
an indefinite article, then
the subject mostly belongs to
the focus, and the verb to the
topic; however, marginal cases
with both subject and verb in
the focus, or with subject

topic and the verb in the
focus are not excludedi
(i)(b) holds, including the rules of
thumb contained in the notei
(ii) holds, only the surface sub-
ject and a temporal adverbial
can belong to the focus, it
they do not ,have the form of
definite NP s;
(iii) holds, with the following
modifications:
(a) If the rightmost complementation
is a local or temporal adverbial, then
it should be checked whether its lexical
meaning is specific (its being
a proper name, a narrower term,or a term
not a belonging to the subject domain of
the given text)or general (a pronoun,
a broader term); in the former case it is
probable that the adverbial bears IC and
belongs to the focus, as in (15) and (16)
while in the latter case it rather be-
longs to the topic, as in (17) or (18),
where the word method probably carries
the IC:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996702727272727">
(b) If the verb is followed by more
than one complementation and if the
sentence final position is occupied by
a definite NP or a pronoun, this right-
most complementation probably is not the
bearer of IC and it thus belongs to the
topic.
(c) If (a) or (b) apply, then it is
also checked which pair of complement-
ations disagreeing in their word order
with their places under systemic order-
ing is closest (from the left) to IC
(i.e. to the end of the focus); the
boundary between the (left-hand part of
the) topic and the focus can then be
drawn between any two complementations
beginning with the given pair.
3.32 If a spoken sentence of English
is analyzed, the position of IC can be
determined more safely, so that it is
easier to identify the end of the focus
than with written sentences and the

modifications to rule (iii) are no longer
necessary. The procedure can be based on
the regularities stated in 3.22.
4. Whenever the preceding context can
be taken into account in the analysis,
the salient (activated) items (see
Haji6ovg and Vrbovg, 1982) should be re-
gistered. A &amp;quot;pushdown!&apos; principle can be
used: the item mentioned as the (last
part of the) focus of the last utterance
is the most salient in the given time-
-point of the discourse, while the elem-
ents that were mentioned in other posit-
ions of this utterance get a lower
status in the activated part of the
stock of shared knowledge, and those
that have not been mentioned in one or
several subsequent utterances may fade
away (it they do not have a specific
position of a &amp;quot;hypertopic&amp;quot;, which con-
cerns e.g. those mentioned in a heading).
Thus it can be decided in some of the un-
clear cases (e.g. with temporal adverbi-
als, see point (iii) in 3.31) whether
a complementation belongs to the topic
or to the focus. This method has its
limits: the set of activated items should
include not only items mentioned in the
text, but also their parts, counterparts
and other items connected with them by
associative relations; on the other side,
if a specific kind of contrast is involv-
ed, it is possible that also an item in-
cluded in this set is mentioned as a part
of the focus of the next utterance.
5. A procedure of automatic identific-
ation of topic and focus has been in-
corporated, to a certain degree, in the
parsgr for Czech implemented in Colmer-
auer s Q-language on EC-1040 (compatible
with IBM 360) and briefly described by
Panevovg and Sgall (1980), Panevovg and
Oliva (1982). The prototypical cases of
topic-focus articulation are also cover-
ed by the English parser designed and im-
plemented (using the same programming to-
ols and hardware) by Kirschner (1982) as
a part of the English-to-Czech machine
translation project.
Both parsers account also for more
complex sentences than the examples quot-
ed in this summary; in some such cases
there are embedded sentence parts that
have (partial) topics and foci of their
own.
Both in translation and comprehension
the topic-focus articulation should be
paid due respect to, since - as we have
seen in Sect. 1 - it is relevant not only
for an appropriate use of a sentence in
different contexts, but also for truth-
-conditional interpretation, especially
of sentences with certain kinds of
quantification and with negation.

With the elements belonging to the focus the scale of CD is determined by the kinds of complementation (deep cases), the order always being in accordance what we call systemicordering; for the main participants of the verb in 264 English this ordering is Time - Actor - - Addressee - Objective - Origin - Effect - Manner - Instrument - Locative (see Seidlova, 1983). The scale of CD differs from this ordering only if at least one of the elements in question belongs to the topic (this is true about the Addressee in (10)(b),about the Origin in (11)(b), and about the Effect in (12) (b) below): I gave several children a few APPLES. I gave a few apples to several CHILDREN. John made a canoe out of a LOG. John made a CANOE out of a log. John made a log into a CANOE. It was a LOG John made into a canoe. in the (b) sentences few aplogand a canoe are contextually standing close few of those apples, one of the logs, the canoe we about,respectively. In the la) examples the rightmost complementations belong to the focus (they carry the intonation center`, while the complementations standing between them and the verb are ambiguous in this respect: in some meanings of the sentence they are contextually bound and belong to the focus; a similar ambiguity concerns also the verbs in all the examples. Systemic ordering is language specific; Czech differs from English e.g. in that it has Time after Actor and Object after Instrument; for more details, see Sgall, Haji6ovA and Panevovi (in press, Chapter 3). 3.1 For an automatic recognition of topic, focus and the degrees of CD, two points are crucial: (A) Either the input is spoken discourse (and the recognition procedure inanalysis), or written (printed) texts are analyzed. (B) Either the input language has (a considerable degree of the so-called free word order (as in Czech, Russian), or its word order is determined mainly by the grammatical relations (as in English, French). Since written texts do not indicate the position of the intonation center and since the &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order is determined first of all by the scale of CD, it is evident that the &amp;quot;either&amp;quot; cases in (A) . and (B) do not present so many difficultrecognition procedure as the &amp;quot;or&amp;quot; cases do. A written &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; corresponds, in general, to several spoken sentences which differ in the placement of their intonation center. Thus, if an adverbial of time or of place stands at the end of the sentence, as in (13), then at least two sentences may be present, see (14)(a) and (b), where the intonation center is marked by the capitals;the TFA clearly differs: (13) We were swimming in the pool in the afternoon. (14)(a) We were swimming in the pool in the AFTERNOON. (b) We were swimming in the POOL in the afternoon. In languages with the so-called free word order this fact does not bring about serious complications with technical there is a strong tendency to arrange the words so that the intonation center falls on the last word of the sentence (if this is not enclitical). 3.2 A procedure for the identification topic and focus in written (first of all technical)texts can then formulated as (i)(a) If the verb is the last word of the surface shape of the sentence (SS), it always belongs to the focus. (b) If the verb is not the last word of the SS, it belongs either to the topic, or to the focus. Note: The ambiguity accounted for by the rule (i)(b) can be partially resolved (esp. for the purposes of practical systems) on the basis of the features of the preceding sentence: if the verb V of the analyzed sentence is identical with the verb of the preceding sentence, or if a relation of synonymy or inclusion holds between the two verbs, then V belongs to the topic. Also, a semantically weak, general verb, such as to be, become, to carry out,can ITithderstood as belong to the topic. In other the primary position of the verb in the focus. (ii) The complementations preceding the verb are included in the topic. (iii) As for the complementations following the verb, the boundary term complementation (sentence part) is used in the sense of a subtree occupying the position of a deep case or adverbial. we disregard the so-called subjective order here, since (in contrast to English) in a Czech written technical text such sentences as SWITCH offare extremely rare. 265 between topic (to the left) and focus (to the right) may be drawn between any two complementations, provided that those belonging to the focus are arranged in the surface word order in accordance with the systemic ordering. (iv) If the sentence contains then case the complementation following the rhematizer belongs to the and the rest of the sentbelongs to the 3.22 Similar regularities hold for the analysis of spoken sentences with normal intonation. However, if a non-final complementation carries the intonation center (IC), then (a) the bearer of the IC belongs to the focus and all the complementations standing after IC belong to the topic; (b) rules (ii) and (iii) apply for the elements standing before the bearer of the intonation center; (c) the rule (i)(b) is applied to the verb (if it does not carry 3.31 As for the identification of topic and focus in an English written sentence, the situation is more complicated due to the fact that the surface word order is to a great extent determined by rules of grammar, so that intonation plays a more substantial role and the written form of the sentence displays much richer ambiguity. For English texts from polytechnical and scientific domains the rules stated for Czech in 3.21 should be modified in the following ways: (i)(a) holds the surface subject of the sentence is a definite NP; if the subject noun has concerns such sentences as Here a device of the first tyne can used; in a secondary case the rhematizer may occur in the topic, e.g. if the sentence part in its scope is repeated from the preceding co-text. an analysis of spoken discourse should pay due respect not only to the preceding co-text, but also to the situation of the utterance, i.e. to its context in the broader sense. an indefinite article, then the subject mostly belongs to the focus, and the verb to the topic; however, marginal cases with both subject and verb in the focus, or with subject (though indefinite) in the topic and the verb in the focus are not excludedi (i)(b) holds, including the rules of thumb contained in the notei (ii) holds, only the surface subject and a temporal adverbial can belong to the focus, it they do not ,have the form of definite NP s; (iii) holds, with the following modifications: (a) If the rightmost complementation is a local or temporal adverbial, then it should be checked whether its lexical meaning is specific (its being a proper name, a narrower term,or a term not a belonging to the subject domain of the given text)or general (a pronoun, a broader term); in the former case it is probable that the adverbial bears IC and belongs to the focus, as in (15) and (16) while in the latter case it rather belongs to the topic, as in (17) or (18), where the word method probably carries the IC: (15) Several teams carried out experiments with this method during a single week. (16) Several teams carried out experiments with this method in Berkeley and Princeton. (17) Several teams ... method during the last decades. (18) Several teams ... method in this country. (b) If the verb is followed by more than one complementation and if the sentence final position is occupied by a definite NP or a pronoun, this rightmost complementation probably is not the bearer of IC and it thus belongs to the topic. (c) If (a) or (b) apply, then it is also checked which pair of complementations disagreeing in their word order with their places under systemic ordering is closest (from the left) to IC (i.e. to the end of the focus); the boundary between the (left-hand part of the) topic and the focus can then be drawn between any two complementations beginning with the given pair. 3.32 If a spoken sentence of English is analyzed, the position of IC can be determined more safely, so that it is easier to identify the end of the focus than with written sentences and the 266 modifications to rule (iii) are no longer necessary. The procedure can be based on the regularities stated in 3.22. 4. Whenever the preceding context can be taken into account in the analysis, the salient (activated) items (see Haji6ovg and Vrbovg, 1982) should be registered. A &amp;quot;pushdown!&apos; principle can be used: the item mentioned as the (last of the) focus of the is the most salient in the given time- -point of the discourse, while the elements that were mentioned in other positions of this utterance get a lower status in the activated part of the stock of shared knowledge, and those that have not been mentioned in one or several subsequent utterances may fade away (it they do not have a specific position of a &amp;quot;hypertopic&amp;quot;, which concerns e.g. those mentioned in a heading). Thus it can be decided in some of the unclear cases (e.g. with temporal adverbials, see point (iii) in 3.31) whether a complementation belongs to the topic or to the focus. This method has its limits: the set of activated items should include not only items mentioned in the text, but also their parts, counterparts and other items connected with them by associative relations; on the other side, if a specific kind of contrast is involved, it is possible that also an item included in this set is mentioned as a part of the focus of the next utterance. 5. A procedure of automatic identification of topic and focus has been incorporated, to a certain degree, in the parsgr for Czech implemented in Colmerauer s Q-language on EC-1040 (compatible with IBM 360) and briefly described by Panevovg and Sgall (1980), Panevovg and Oliva (1982). The prototypical cases of topic-focus articulation are also covered by the English parser designed and implemented (using the same programming tools and hardware) by Kirschner (1982) as a part of the English-to-Czech machine translation project. Both parsers account also for more complex sentences than the examples quoted in this summary; in some such cases there are embedded sentence parts that have (partial) topics and foci of their own. Both in translation and comprehension the topic-focus articulation should be paid due respect to, since as we have seen in Sect. 1 it is relevant not only for an appropriate use of a sentence in different contexts, but also for truth- -conditional interpretation, especially of sentences with certain kinds of quantification and with negation.</abstract>
