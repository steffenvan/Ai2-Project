ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999890235294118">
In this paper the text theoretical foundation of
our text analysis system KONTEXT is described.
The basic premise of the KONTEXT model is that
new concepts are communicated by using the
mechanisms of text constitution. The text model
used assumes that the information conveyed in a
text and the information describing its contextual
organization can be structured into five layers
(sentence structure, information on thematic pro-
gression, referential structure, conceptual repre-
sentation of the text and conceptual background
knowledge). The text analysis component con-
structs and traverses the information of these lay-
ers under control of the discourse development. In
this way, it can incrementally construct a textual
view on knowledge, rather than only recognizing
precoded concepts.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985428571429">
In the field of knowledge-based text analysis it
has been regarded as insufficient to analyze a text
against the background of static and stereotypic
default assumptions for some time (cf. [Hell-
wig84], [Scha/Bruce/Polanyi87]). By applying
this method the pre-coded concepts are invoked
again and again during the process of text analysis,
regardless of the changes and the new concepts
being constituted by the ongoing text. The func-
tion of a text, however, is not confined to concept
selection as in current knowledge-based applica-
tions. In addition, textual mechanisms are used to
operate on concepts and to compose them to actual
contexts, i.e. to constitute (new) concepts. Textu-
ally the contexts are established by the thematic
and by the referential structure. Thus, new mecha-
nisms are required which permit the textual orga-
nization to control the creation and manipulation
of concepts in text processing. In a way, this is to
tie linguistic and knowledge-based approaches to
text processing together into a single method.

2 THE KONTEXT MODEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990206857142857">
The basic premise of the KONTEXT model is
that the relationship of expression and concept are
changed during a text and concepts are communi-
cated by using the mechanisms of text constitu-
tion. The KONTEXT model is based on the as-
sumption that
• the information conveyed in a text and the
information describing its contextual orga-
nization can be structured into five layers.
They define the sentence structure, informa-
tion on thematic progression, the referential
structure, the conceptual representation of
the text and the conceptual background
knowledge;

<listItem confidence="0.728442166666667">
• discourse provides the basic mechanisms by
which concepts are constructed. Discourse
is defined as sequences of transitions be-
tween discourse states and discourse states
are defined by the information represented
in the layers.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9634361">
The text analysis component constructs and
traverses the information of these layers under
control of the discourse development. In this way,
it can incrementally construct a textual view on
knowledge, rather than only recognizing pre-
coded concepts.
We will now describe the layers of the text repre-
- 263 -
sentation. In the following section we discuss the
conception of discourse in more detail.

2.1 LAYERS OF TEXT REPRESENTA-
TION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997608147286822">
There are five layers of text representation:
sentence structure
thematic structure
referential structure
view
background knowledge
The lowest layer is the basis for textual com-
munication. It is a formal representation of con-
cepts modeling an open world and serves as back-
ground knowledge. Since we allow for the con-
struction of new details and concepts, an organi-
zation of concepts is provided which supports this
task. Our background knowledge differs from tra-
ditional knowledge bases in that it does not repre-
sent a particular domain model which assigns a
predefined and fixed structure to the concepts. It is
rather organized around expressions and models
their referential potential in terms of concepts. It
resembles a meaning dictionary (like e.g. [CO-
BUrLD87] which is used as the basic material),
where with expressions concepts are constituted
and used to explain other concepts. Basically all
concepts are of the same rank with respect to an
open world. During discourse the concepts are ac-
cessed via explicitly modeled perspectives on
them [Kunze90] [Melcuk87] depending on the ac-
tual textual development (e.g. actual state of con-
texts, c.f. 2.2 discourse state).
The next layer, the view, models the subject
matter of the text using the concepts which are de-
fined in the background knowledge. The ongoing
discourse selects concepts from the background
knowledge or the already existing view, reorga-
nizes their structure and (re-)integrates them co-
herently into the already existing view. The con-
cepts constructed in the view during discourse
provide the text specific perspective on the back-
ground knowledge.
The layer of the referential structure represents
reference objects and their relationships. It drops
details of the concept definition in accordance
with the abstraction level of references in the text,
and represents those complexes as units which are
explicitly referred to by linguistic means in the
text.
The layer of thematic structure traces the dis-
course development. It represents the contextual
clustering of reference objects and traces the de-
velopment of their clustering. This trace repre-
sents the progression of themes and the develop-
ment of focusing. The notion of thematic structure
is based on the Prague School approaches to the
thematic organization (e.g. [Danes70][Hajicova/
Sga1188][Hajicovg/Vrbova82]), which we refine
by distinguishing the mechanisms involved in
terms of the textual function of linguistic means
with respect to the different layers of the text re-
presentation.
In our model the units of the layer of thematic
structure are contexts. By context we understand a
cluster of reference objects, where within a con-
text the relationship between a reference expres-
sion and its reference object is unequivocal. Dur-
ing the ongoing discourse, however, this relation-
ship and the groups of reference objects which are
clustered together change. Whether or not lingui-
stic means create new contexts, and which kind of
clustering of reference objects they effect, de-
pends on their textual function and on the state of
discourse they operate on (examples of this are
given below). Contexts are the units of the thema-
tic progression. It is this grouping of reference ob-
jects that is referred to by linguistic means imme-
diately, that is changed, resumed, revised and tied
up to during discourse. The thematic structure is
the result of creating, closing and referring to con-
texts. The movement of contexts traces the growth
of the view.
It should be noted that complex progression types
can be constructed. This is due to the ability of
predicative expressions to cover several themes
by virtue of their arity and due to the textual possi-
bility of changing the structure of a contextually
clustered concept by changing the focus when ref-
erring to a context Therefore hierarchical struc-
tures as proposed by different approaches to de-
scribing the structuring of actual texts are not suf-
ficient to cope with the ability of natural language
texts to constitute contextual relations (cf. content
- 264 -
oriented structures: e.g. thematic progression
[Danes70] — at least the five forms elaborated are
hierarchical —), or discourse segmentations: e.g.
discourse constituent units [Polanyi88], context
spaces [Reichman85], rhetorical structures
[Mannahompson88], superstructures and ma-
crostructures [vanDijk831) .
The sentence structure describes the linguistic
means used in the text to express the information
encoded in the lower layers.
Our representation models structural relation-
ships of text constitution principles. The back-
ground knowledge provides concepts for the con-
stitution of the semantic text representation
(view). The concepts constructed in the view dur-
ing discourse provide the text specific perspective
on the background knowledge.
Referential structure and thematic structure each
cluster structures of the lower layers. Reference
objects group conceptual definitions into units
which can be referred to by ensuing linguistic ex-
pressions. The sequence of thematizing defines a
clustering of reference objects into contexts.
Whilst the lower layers contain more static infor-
mation which is independent of the actual se-
quence of the textual presentation, the dynamic of
discourse, i.e. the growth of the view during the
ongoing discourse, is represented in the layers of
thematic structure and sentence structure.
The modeling allows for a text driven control of
operations on the knowledge base and on the view,
because the manipulations of the lower layers de-
pend on the interpretation of the upper layer phe-
nomena.
We define the types of manipulations necessary in
terms of the contribution linguistic means make to
the layers of the text representation. The defini-
tions are placed in a text lexicon (cf. the example
given below).

2.2 DISCOURSE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999464097560976">
By discourse we understand a sequence of
state transitions which is guided by the interpreta-
tion of linguistic means. It models textual access
to concepts: A text does not communicate con-
cepts at once. It rather guides sequential access
and operations on knowledge that produce a par-
ticular view on the concepts of the background
knowledge.
A discourse state is defined by the actual state
of all the five layers of the text representation,
which renders the actual state of the view and the
actual access structure to view and background
knowledge. While the view grows during the ana—
lysis, only a small segment of it is in the focus of
attention at one state, and the objects which are re-
ferred to by linguistic expressions may change
state by state. A discourse state provides the im-
mediate context to which ensuing linguistic
means can refer directly, and also previous con-
texts.
The transition of a discourse state is the effect
of the interpretation of a linguistic expression. It is
determined by the textual function of linguistic
means. Modeling the operational semantics oflin-
guistic means within the framework outlined
leads to our text lexica.
Differences of the view of two discourse states
which are produced by a discourse state transition
can be regarded as the semantic contribution of a
linguistic expression. But it is important to note
that this contribution is not only determined by the
isolated expression, and that therefore analysis
does not involve a static mapping from a textual
expression to some semantic representation or
vice versa. The contribution rather depends on the
actual state of the preceding discourse on which
the expression operates. Note also that there are
expressions whose interpretation does not con-
tribute to the growth of the view. In an actual text
they rather are used in order to manipulate the the-
matic organization (e.g. redirections).

3 EXAMPLE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962787195121951">
With a small example we illustrate how the
KONTEXT model works. We show how a refer-
ence object and a concept corresponding to a ref-
erential expression is created, and how the rela-
tionship between expression and concept is
changed during the discourse. From a sample text
we take the following sentence and show that dis-
course state transitions already occur while inter-
preting this sentence textually:
&amp;quot;The electronic dictionaries that are the goal of
EDR will be dictionaries of computers , by comput-
ers, and for computers.&amp;quot;
We provide a selection of three discourse states
showing view and access structure after the inter-
pretation of &amp;quot;The electronic dictionaries&amp;quot; (figure
- 265 -
1), after &amp;quot;that are the goal of EDR&amp;quot; (figure 2), and
after &amp;quot;will be dictionaries of computers, by com-
puters, and for computers.&amp;quot; (figure 3). Each figure
then is explained by describing the textual func-
tion of the linguistic means concerned, i.e. by de-
scribing how they operate on previous discourse
states and what their contribution to the layers of
the text representation is. These definitions are
placed in a text lexicon. Because we want to draw
the attention to the nature of textual functions of
linguistic means and to the possibility to distin-
guish and to describe these functions with respect
to the layers of the text representation, we confine
ourselves to demonstrating this by discussing only
those readings which lead to a solution in our ex-
ample.
The sentence structure used is the structure the
PLAIN grammar [Hellwig80] attributes to a sen-
tence, and for the graphical representation of our
example we use the conventions explained in the
legend (see below). The names of the roles in the
view and in the background knowledge have been
chosen for mnemotechnical reasons only, they are
not to be confused with the conceptual modeling
of prepositions.

does not have an entry &amp;quot;electronic dictionary&amp;quot;,
which means that in the background knowledge no
corresponding concept exists.
&amp;quot;electronic&amp;quot;: As an adjective, &amp;quot;electronic&amp;quot; refers
to the reference item --e1X—, which does not select
a concept, but a conceptual structure which is used
to extend or to modify the dominating noun&apos;s con-
cept. In [COBUILD87] there are two conceptual
aspects of &amp;quot;electronic&amp;quot;, which are related to each
other. At first &amp;quot;electronic&amp;quot; can be &apos;a device, which
has silicon chips and is used as a means for elec-
tronic methods&apos;. Secondly &apos;a method&apos; can be re-
ferred to as &amp;quot;electronic&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;dictionary&amp;quot;: Initially &amp;quot;dictionary&amp;quot; refers to the
reference object &lt;dict&gt;. Conceptually &amp;quot;dictiona-
ry&amp;quot; can refer to two aspects: It can refer to &apos;a physi-
cal device, which is made of paper and serves as a
medium for recording symbols; it has been com-
piled by an author and is used for reference pur-
poses.&apos; It can also refer to &apos;the recorded symbols as
a work&apos;.

&amp;quot;electronic dictionary&amp;quot;: In order to find a con-
ceptual definition of the introduced reference ob-
ject &lt;eldict&gt; we create a less specific abstract con-
cept of dictionary. On the one hand it must be as
specific as possible, and on the other hand it must
be compatible with what is known conceptually
about the referential item --e1X—. &apos;Electronic dic-
tionary&apos; then is a combination of &apos;electronic&apos; and
&apos;dictionary&apos; leaving open e.g. the incompatible
device &apos;paper&apos;. A more specific concept of &amp;quot;dic-
tionary&amp;quot; is introduced. This means that from now
on the text will not deal with &amp;quot;dictionaries&amp;quot; in gen-
eral, but with &amp;quot;dictionaries&amp;quot; in the restricted con-
text of &amp;quot;electronic dictionaries&amp;quot;. Therefore a new
context is opened, and in this new context &amp;quot;dictio-
naries&amp;quot; refers to a new reference object &lt;eldict&gt;
which can be the theme of the further ongoing dis-
course.

4 CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976142857143">
The model described in this contribution
serves as a theoretical foundation of a computer
implementation of a text analysis system. It en-
ables us to model a discourse which can simulate
the communication of new concepts. In this simu-
lation concepts are constituted sequentially by
means of state transitions which are the effect of
the interpretation of the actual textual usage of a
limited set of linguistic means. This technique of-
fers the possibility to create actual concepts on the
basis of globally and unspecifically defined con-
cepts. Thus texts are regarded as construction in-
structions which guide the incremental construc-
tion of views on conceptual knowledge bases.

It drops details of the concept definition in accordance with the abstraction level of references in the text, and represents those complexes as units which are explicitly referred to by linguistic means in the text. The layer of thematic structure traces the discourse development. It represents the contextual clustering of reference objects and traces the development of their clustering. This trace represents the progression of themes and the development of focusing. The notion of thematic structure is based on the Prague School approaches to the thematic organization (e.g. [Danes70][Hajicova/ Sga1188][Hajicovg/Vrbova82]), which we refine by distinguishing the mechanisms involved in terms of the textual function of linguistic means with respect to the different layers of the text representation. In our model the units of the layer of thematic structure are contexts. By context we understand a cluster of reference objects, where within a context the relationship between a reference expression and its reference object is unequivocal. During the ongoing discourse, however, this relationship and the groups of reference objects which are clustered together change. Whether or n</context>

This is due to the ability of predicative expressions to cover several themes by virtue of their arity and due to the textual possibility of changing the structure of a contextually clustered concept by changing the focus when referring to a context Therefore hierarchical structures as proposed by different approaches to describing the structuring of actual texts are not sufficient to cope with the ability of natural language texts to constitute contextual relations (cf. content - 264 - oriented structures: e.g. thematic progression [Danes70] — at least the five forms elaborated are hierarchical —), or discourse segmentations: e.g. discourse constituent units [Polanyi88], context spaces [Reichman85], rhetorical structures [Mannahompson88], superstructures and macrostructures [vanDijk831) .

The text analysis component constructs and traverses the information of these layers under control of the discourse development. In this way, it can incrementally construct a textual view on knowledge, rather than only recognizing precoded concepts. 1 INTRODUCTION In the field of knowledge-based text analysis it has been regarded as insufficient to analyze a text against the background of static and stereotypic default assumptions for some time (cf. [Hellwig84], [Scha/Bruce/Polanyi87]). By applying this method the pre-coded concepts are invoked again and again during the process of text analysis, regardless of the changes and the new concepts being constituted by the ongoing text. The function of a text, however, is not confined to concept selection as in current knowledge-based applications. In addition, textual mechanisms are used to operate on concepts and to compose them to actual contexts, i.e. to constitute (new) concepts. Textually the contexts are established by the thematic and by the referential structure. Thus, new mechanisms are required</context>

These definitions are placed in a text lexicon. Because we want to draw the attention to the nature of textual functions of linguistic means and to the possibility to distinguish and to describe these functions with respect to the layers of the text representation, we confine ourselves to demonstrating this by discussing only those readings which lead to a solution in our example. The sentence structure used is the structure the PLAIN grammar [Hellwig80] attributes to a sentence, and for the graphical representation of our example we use the conventions explained in the legend (see below). The names of the roles in the view and in the background knowledge have been chosen for mnemotechnical reasons only, they are not to be confused with the conceptual modeling of prepositions.

It is rather organized around expressions and models their referential potential in terms of concepts. It resembles a meaning dictionary (like e.g. [COBUrLD87] which is used as the basic material), where with expressions concepts are constituted and used to explain other concepts. Basically all concepts are of the same rank with respect to an open world. During discourse the concepts are accessed via explicitly modeled perspectives on them [Kunze90] [Melcuk87] depending on the actual textual development (e.g. actual state of contexts, c.f. 2.2 discourse state). The next layer, the view, models the subject matter of the text using the concepts which are defined in the background knowledge. The ongoing discourse selects concepts from the background knowledge or the already existing view, reorganizes their structure and (re-)integrates them coherently into the already existing view. The concepts constructed in the view during discourse provide the text specific perspective on the background knowledge. The layer of the referential structure </context>
