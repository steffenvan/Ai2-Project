ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999917142857143">
With the intention of indicating some
temporal/event-theoretic characteristics
of distributive clauses, a generalisation
is made over distributives and clauses
marked for iterative aspect: two kinds of
semantic phenomena which have normally
been confined to separate theoretical
domains. It is shown that in particular,
both give rise to an &apos;inferential set
construction&apos; problem. An informal
outline is given of what might constitute
such a generalisation. The generalisation
is proposed intially on grounds of prima
facie plausibility, but its ultimate
defensibility and explanatory value will
depend on the validity of its consequence,
that distributive clauses entail a
multiplicity of temporal entities or
events. This proposal is considered with
respect to two types of discourse
phenomena; anaphoric reference to event
entities, and temporal binding. These
provide further support for making the
generalisation, clarify its nature and
indicate in what respect the entailment
claim can be true of distributives. The
set construction problem is of practical
importance for computational models of
natural language interaction, and since
the concept of iterated action is central
to planning, the generalisation across
iteration and distributives, along with
the observations about their nature, have
interesting implications for work in this
area.

<bodyText confidence="0.9989198">
First, three points about the body of
phenomena called &apos;distributives&apos;. These
are taken to be relatively
uncontroversial, and are simply assumed in
the rest of this paper.
(i) Examples (a) and (b) in (1)
illustrate the distributive/collective
distinction. Essentially, sentences
containing at least one plural or
universally quantified NP, the denotation
of which might be regarded as a set, •can
either be read in terms of the individual
members of this set (as in la), or given a
&apos;group&apos; reading in terms of the set as a
whole (as in lb).
(1)a The three girls each had a
pizza. (dist)
b The three girls shared a
pizza. (coll)
(ii) It is distributive readings which
give rise to the possibility of quantifier
scope ambiguities including
interpretations which involve dependency
relations between the NPs in the sentence.
Dependency interpretations in turn allow
&apos;inferential set construction&apos;. Consider
example (2).
(2) Mary gave each boy A book
a ...and told him to look after
it.
b They took them into the garden
to read.
On the most common reading of the
distributive clause Mary gave each boy a
book, there is a dependency relation
between the two object NPs such that a
kook is in the scope of each boy and the
interpretation of the former is relative
to that of the latter. (2b) illustrates
one type of anaphoric relation which
distributive clauses may participate in:
plural pronouns and definite NPs are used
to refer to implicit sets of entities
which instantiate variables introduced in
distributive clauses by just such singular
indefinite NPs in the scope of
distributive NPs. So in (2b) the
underlined NP they refers to the set of
books such that Mary gave each one to some
boy.
As Webber (1979, 1983) has pointed
out, this anaphoric possibility represents
a practical problem for computational
accounts of .discourse, since a mechanism
is required for constructing as a

discourse entity a set with the correct
description, on the basis of the semantic
representation of the initial distributive
sentence containing the singular
indefinite NP.
Notice that singular anaphora (as in
2a) is also possible: the singular anaphor
indicates the maintenance of a rhetorical
mode of &apos;generalisation through
singularisation&apos;, which is established by
the initial distributive sentence. The
pronoun it acts as a placeholder,
signifying a representative member of the
set of books such that Mary gave each one
to some boy, and it has the status of a
&apos;bound variable&apos;. Such pronouns cannot be
taken to refer and I describe the contrast
between them and the plural anaphors as
being that the plural ones represent a
&apos;referential or &apos;extensional&apos; cashing out
of the initial semantic value.
(iii) Sentence (2b) also indicates the
possibility of using a plural pronoun -
they - to refer to some relevant set of
boys (in contrast to (2a) where the
singular, &apos;bound variable&apos; pronoun him is
used). However, it is not really necessary
to propose a second algorithm to construct
such sets because the initial,
syntactically singular distributive NPs,
such as each hsa, are arguably almost
always themselves &apos;referential&apos; and
&apos;anaphoric&apos;, just in the sense that the
range of quantification is restricted by
context. Here, the quantifier does not
range over the set of all boys, but over
some otherwise specified subset [&apos;host&apos; or
&apos;witness set&apos; - Barwise &amp; Cooper, 1981] of
boys. It can be paraphrased with the
partitive expression: each 21 the boys.
My intention in this paper is to
explore a temporal, event-oriented
perspective on distributives. The
question at issue is: What are the
consequences for the temporal or event-
theoretical analysis of a clause, of its
being &apos;distributive&apos; in the sense defined?
temporal binding. These support the
hypothesised generalisation and tell us
something about the temporal or event-
theoretical structure of both
distributives and iteratives.
The observations made in this paper
are confined to the past tense and to
&apos;telic&apos; or &apos;bounded&apos; situation types
(Mourelatos, 1981).

2. ITERATIVES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996649423076923">
The following are examples of
iterative clauses in English:
(3)a Each day Mary wrote a letter
to her sister.
b Every time John went abroad
he bought a souvenir.
Vesuvius erupted three
times.
Iterativity is an aspectual parameter
which in English is marked mainly
adverbially, with the presence of what are
called &apos;frequency adverbials&apos; or &apos;temporal
quantifiers&apos; (underlined in the examples).
Iterative markers on a clause indicate the
repetition of the event described in the
clause, and also provide information about
the frequency of repetition. The key
requirement is couched in terms of an
entailment condition: iteratives entail
that there was more than one occasion on
each of which an event of type E occurred,
where &apos;occasion&apos; is defined as
spatiotemporal location. So there is a
necessary requirement of seouentialitv:
that the events in question occurred on
different occasions, in sequence.

3. GENERALISATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.855999727272727">
On the basis of the descriptions given
in sections 1 and 2 we can argue for a
generalisation over distributives and
iteratives such as is represented in
Figure 1 (cf. Forsyth, 1970: 154).

<bodyText confidence="0.99970376">
There are a number of intuitive
arguments for the prima facie plausibility
of such a generalisation, two of which
will be considered here.
First, it is clear that from one point
of view, distributives and iteratives
differ just in the nature of what is
quantified over: distributives, where the
marking of repetition is normally on the
NP, involve quantification over
individuals, while the temporal adverbial
expressions in the iterative examples are
normally taken to involve quantification
over times or events. That is, the
iterative markers can be seen as
introducing distributive quantification.
Secondly, perhaps the strongest
argument for generalisation is that
inferential set construction occurs with
iteratives. Some iteratives, like
distributives, contain indefinite NPs
whose instantiations may vary across the
repetition of the event. A souvenir in
example (4), and a letter in example (5)
are just such NPs.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.857979">
(4) Everytime John went abroad he
bought A souvenir.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993267025974026">
a Sometimes j was a silver tea-
spoon, sometimes an antique vase.
b They just lie around the house,
cluttering it up.
(5) Each day, Mary wrote A letter
to her sister.
a It was usually ten pages long.
b They were chatty letters.
Iteratives such as these manifest the
same scope ambiguities as distributives
and are open to the same mechanism of &apos;set
construction&apos; which as we saw operates in
distributive clauses on the NPs which are
distributed over. So in (4), A souvenir
is in the scope of a restricted universal
quantification over times, and the
sentence in question could be followed by
(b) where they refers to the set of
souvenirs such that John bought each one
on some trip abroad. (4a) and (5a) show
that something like the &apos;bound variable&apos;
anaphora of example (2a) is possible here
too. [1]
[1] The expression &apos;variable binding&apos;,
traditionally taken to describe an in-
trasentential phenomenon, is used with a
less restrictive sense in this paper.
The solution to the set construction
problem should if possible be a general
one, covering both distributive and
iterative cases.
The ultimate defensibility, and
explanatory value, of making such a
generalisation will depend on whether it
accurately reflects the facts about the
temporal or event-theoretical structure of
distributive clauses. It was said that
iteratives are customarily defined as
entailing a seauence of events, each
associated with a different occasion or
spatiotemporal location. A generalisation
of the kind envisaged would suggest that
distributives might be regarded as having
such an entailment as well, and the
question we have to consider is whether
this is so.
Certainly, some distributives clearly •
involve multiple occasions, that is,
spatiotemporal locations. For example
(6a), where it&apos;s one and the same book
which is lent, and (6b).
(6)a Mary lent each boy the book.
b John visited each of his
aunts..
On the other hand, take an example
like (2) above (Mary gave each boy a
h22k). This could easily describe a
single occasion of giving, taking place
once only. One could even imagine Mary
handing a book to each of two boys
simultaneously, with either hand. Or
consider (7), on the interpretation where
it was the same message and I did it on
one occasion.
(7) Yesterday I sent each student
a message via computer mail.
Intuition is clearly not enough, and
in sections 4 and 5 we shall consider
evidence from the discourse phenomena
mentioned earlier, but first, what would
constitute such a generalisation over
iteratives and distributives: a
generalisation which would indicate their
similarities and differences, and provide
a way in which the entailment of multiple
temporal entities/events could be said to
be true of distributives?

We can regard a clause as providing,
at one level of description, a pattern or
template, with specification of an event
type with respect to placeholders for the
following elements: one or more
participants, and spatiotemporal location.
Figure 2 is the skeleton of such templates
or &apos;case specifications&apos;, which will be
fleshed out for individual clauses.
Distributive and iterative markers alike
then contribute the following information:
- first, that there are multiple
instantiations of this pattern rather than
a single instantiation;
- and, in conjunction with other
grammatical features of the clause, they
provide information about which of these
elements remain constant across such
instantiations and which are variable.
For example, take the sentence Each
day, Mary wrote A letter 1g lex sister
(Figure 3). This specifies a writina
event type which (as indicated by &apos;R&apos;) is
repeatedly instantiated. Two of the
participants, Mary and her sister, remain
constant across these repetitions. The
other participant, the letter, varies and
will be instantiated by a (possibly)
different entity on each occasion of
repetition. There is also variation in
the spatiotemporal element. This element
is represented here by the time variable,
tv , while tr represents the reference
time of the iterated complex as a whole.
It is with respect to this second kind
of information, about which of the
elements vary, that iteratives and
distributives differ. In iterative but
not in distributive clauses the
spatiotemporal location will necessarily
be among those elements which are
variable; other elements may also vary if
they are introduced by expressions in a
scopal dependency relation with the

distributives, at least one of the
participant elements must vary - the one
introduced by the distributive NP - and in
addition so may other elements, including
spatiotemporal location, if they are in a
dependency relation with this NP. If no
other participant element is in a
dependency relation with the distributive
NP, that is if all other participant
elements are held constant, then variation
in spatiotemporal location will entail, as
in example (6a). Which elements vary
tells us which inferential sets to
construct.
The similarities between the informal
proposal which has just been sketched and .
Lewis&apos;s (1975) account of temporal
quantifiers in terms of cases will be
obvious. Lewis defines a case as an n-
tuple of its Participants (i.e. the values
of free variables in the sentence) and a
time coordinate [the &apos;case specifications&apos;
represented above include in addition an
event type label, such as &apos;writing&apos;]. He
argues that iterative markers involve
quantification over cases rather than over
times or events. My proposal could be
interpreted as a claim that we can extend
some version of a case analysis to include
distributives: these, too, would be taken
to involve quantification over cases.
Quantification over times or participants
would then represent particular ways of
realising the multiple instantiation of
the case. The advantages of an account
such as this are that it allows
generalisation over a wide variety of
phenomena, including numerous ways of
marking iteration or distribution on the
clause, and that it provides an
appropriate level of description to be
referred to in accounting for discourse
anaphoric relations.
The question of the individuation of
events is a controversial one, and the
terms &apos;event&apos; and &apos;event type&apos; have so far
been used rather loosely. Suppose we
first follow Mourelatos (1981) in making a
distinction between events and the
spatiotemporal locations with which they
are associated, and secondly, suggest that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996298">
19
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892133333333">
events should be regarded as particular
instantiations of case specifications of
the type described. Then iteratives
entail a multiplicity of cases/events +
spatiotemporal locations (which are in
some isomorphic relationship), whereas
distributives likewise entail a
multiplicity of cases/events, but merely
allow the possibility of multiple
spatiotemporal locations (i.e., events and
spatiotemporal locations may not be in an
isomorphic relationship) - as we shall
see, in the case of any particular
distributive, this question may be
resolved by following anaphoric reference.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.9191" genericHeader="method">
4. ANAPHORIC REFERENCE TO EVENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9754486">
(8) John visited each of his
great aunts.
a Ih.g. visits were much appreciated
by the old ladies.
b These occasions were a source of
torment to him.
(9) Everytime John went to Namibia
he visited an old friend.
a He found the visits distressing.
b He was upset on these occasions.
Examples (8) and (9) indicate that
after a distributive or iterative clause,
speakers can refer using a plural definite
NP, to a set of entities which are
something like &apos;events&apos; or &apos;occasions&apos; and
which appear to correspond to the
distributive or iterated situation of the
preceding clause. Note the two types of
example (a and b): in the first, the
common noun head of the anaphoric
expression is a nominalisation of the verb
in the antecedent sentence (such NPs are
normally taken to refer to event
entities); in the second the noun is a
much more general one. Both kinds of
example appear to represent a phenomenon
of the same type as the inferential set
construction described in section 1: it is
as if the initial distributive or
iterative clause introduces an &apos;event&apos;
variable and the anaphoric NPs represent a
referential/extensional cashing out of
this.
Continuing the parallel with anaphoric
reference to nominally-introduced
entities, example (10) shows that with
respect to event entities too, singular
anaphoric NPs occur which are of the
&apos;bound variable&apos; type. Thus in (10) the
visit signifies a representative event of
the type described:
(10) John visited each of his
maiden aunts, but the visit didn&apos;t
make him popular with any of them.
A second type of singular anaphora
occurs, as in (11): in this case the
anaphoric pronoun that appears to refer to
the whole distributive episode, of John
visiting each aunt, described in the
preceding clause.
(11) John visited each of his
aunts. That was a thoughtful thing
to do.
Finally, examples (12) and (13) show
that, although plural definite NPs can be
used to access the set of events or
occasions resulting from
distributive/iterative clauses (as in (8)
and (9)), plural pronouns cannot. In (12)
they and them can only be interpreted with
reference to the aunts - compare the same
sentences with the pronouns replaced by
the NP ths visits. Explanation of this,
which there is not space to elaborate
here, must take account of the obvious
fact that a requirement of nominalisation
is involved. Meanwhile the important
point to note is the clear distinction
between the distribution of definite NP
and pronominal anaphors.

Example (11) shows that singular
pronominal reference does occur, but this
seeming inconsistency may be explained in
terms of the nature of the entity being
referred to: the plural NPs seem to refer
to events whereas the singular ones refer
to &apos;facts&apos; or &apos;propositions (in the sense
of the distinction argued for in Vendler
(1967)). [3]

5. TEMPORAL BINDING PHENOMENA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988484628318584">
First it is necessary to review some
claims of theories of temporal reference.
Consider the following example:
(14) When John made the cake, he
broke the oven.
When, like other &apos;temporal
connectives&apos; such as before and after,
indicates a particular relationship
between the two clauses it connects:
normally such relationships are considered
to consist in specification of the
relative ordering in time of the two
events described by these clauses. The
basic claim, then, is that such
connectives give a specification of a kind
of &apos;temporal binding between the two
clauses such that the reference time of
one is dependent on that of the other.
This claim is independent of the
particular nature of the ordering or
binding hypothesised. (This idea is
clearly on a par with claims that certain
temporal phenomena should be understood on
analogy with nominal anaphora, for example
that the (past) tense morpheme should be
taken to refer to a time, and to receive
its reference either from some antecedent
tense morpheme in the text, or from some
adverbial expression, or deictically.)
Kamp (1979), Hinrichs (1982)L and
Partee (1984), who subscribe to a
discourse theory of temporal (ordering)
relations, argue that (in narrative
discourse) the reference time of any main
clause will be dependent on that of the
preceding clause; that is, that just the
same kinds of temporal binding
dependencies occur at the level of
discourse, between clauses which are
syntactically independent as well as
between those which are linked by temporal
connectives.
With this background, we can consider
clauses which involve iteration, marked by
temporal quantification, in addition to
temporal connection of the type just
described. For example (15).
(15) When Max left the office, he
always turned the lights off.
It seems that such sentences
said with respect to the phenomena exam-
ined in this section; this will be dealt
with in forthcoming work.
constitute a binding or dependency,
between two clauses describing distinct
types of event, which puts a condition on
the pairwise mapping of instantiations of
such events. Thus, in this case, every
event of Max leaving the office is said to
have been paired with (at least one) event
of his turning the lights off. This kind
of dependency relation seems to be exactly
parallel to that which holds between the
distributive NP each girl and the
indefinite NP A book in Mary cave each
airl A 1:)ook. In terms of the schema in
Figures 2 and 3, binding is of the
temporal variable tv of clause one, and
the tv of clause two.
Notice that the when clause restricts
the range of the iterative quantifier
always in the following clause. Examples
like (15) are a special case of temporal
quantification in that the condition on
the range of quantification is explicitly
stated in the subordinate clause. But it
is true in general that temporal
quantifiers like always or each time do
not range over all of time, but over some
contextually fixed interval. They thus
conform to the claim made in section 1
that distributive NPs normally have their
range of quantification restricted to some
otherwise-specified &apos;witness set&apos;. The
reference time t of Figure 3 represents
this kind of witness set.
The main point to be made in this
section is that distributive clauses, with
no explicit temporal quantification, can
also act as sources for temporal binding,
- and restrict the range of subsequent
temporal quantification, in just the same
way that the iteratfve clauses do. Hence
we find examples like (16) and (17).
(16) Mary gave each boy a book.
Sometimes the boy thanked her, but
pore often he did not.
(17) Harry invited each of his
relatives to stay. On each occa-
sion he bought in enough food to
feed an army.
Here, the range of the quantifier
phrases sometimes, more often and on each
occasion is restricted by the set of
events determined by the preceding
distributive clause - that is, by
something like the set of instantiations
of the case specification, perhaps more
specifically, instantiations of the
temporal variable t . There is binding
between the event N described in the two
sentences: in (16) some of the &apos;times&apos;
(occasions) on which Mary gave some boy a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997931">

<bodyText confidence="0.994412886524823">
book are such that the boy in question
thanked her; in (17) each occasion on
which Harryts relatives came to stay is
paired with an event of his buying in lots
of food.
Example (18), which is from a
university library photocopying machine,
is exactly parallel to the temporally
quantified and connected example given in
(15). Here, each plays the same role as
always does in (15).
(18) Please wait until machine is
completely silent before inserting
each 5p coin.
This example is (theoretically)
ambiguous in the scope of the distributive
marker: does the first clause represent a
condition for the iterated event, so that
we are to wait until the machine is silent
and then insert all the 5ps one after
another, or is it part of an iterated
condition + event sequence, so that on
each occasion of inserting 5p, we must
wait until the machine is silent first?
(In actuality, it is of course the second
reading which is intended.)
Now consider the following examples,
with another temporal connective, then.
(19) Mary gave each boy a book.
a Then she marked his name off
her list as having received it.
b Then she dismissed them.
(20) Everytime John went abroad he
brought back a souvenir.
a Then he put it in the cupboard
with the rest of them.
b Then he stopped going abroad and
threw them all away.
These examples indicate that the
initial distributive or iterative sentence
can be viewed either in terms of its unity
as a complex situation, or in terms of the
constituent phases which that total
comprises (cf. examples (8) and (11) in
section 4). Hence in (19) the reference
time of (b), the dismissal, will be after
the completion of the complex event of
giving out books, (in terms of the case
specification in Figures 2 and 3 the t of
(b) will be after the t of the iniEial
sentence). In contrast, the sequence in
(19a) is such that the then clause is &apos;in
the scope of&apos; the distributive and there
is a pairwise binding between the event
type of giving out a book and the event
type of marking off a name, such that each
instantiation of the former will be
followed by an instantiation of the
latter. That is, there is a temporal
ordering condition on the temporal
variables t of the two clauses. The
whole sequXnce will have the same t,;
overall reference time or &apos;witness set*.
If we regard temporal connectives as
indicating a relationship defined over
reference times, then we are put in the
position of recognising two possibilities
with respect to distributive/iterative
sentences: these seem to involve
something like &apos;nested reference times&apos;,
with the ordering relation being able to
hold over either tv or tr. Consider also
examples (21) and (22).
(21) Mary gave each boy a book.
a On each occasion the boy
thanked her.
b On that occasion they were
grateful to her.
(22) John visited each of his
maiden aunts. Each one gave him a
cup of tea.
Example (22) is particularly
interesting, because we have a sequence of
two clauses which are not syntactically
linked by a temporal connective, and
neither of which contains a temporal
quantifier phrase. Yet there is an
implication that there is a pairwise
dependency relation between teas and
visits. The generalised binding
relationship appears to hold across the
sentence boundary, just as Kamp, Hinrichs
and Partee postulated with respect to
ordering relations between clauses
describing single rather than repeated
situations. Any analysis of this discourse
which assigns each sentence a single
reference time, and which then, following
Hinrichs and Partee, requires that the
reference time for the second follow that

nominal anaphora which were outlined in
section 1 of the paper. The (a) examples
in (19), (20) and (21) in each case
represent something like maintenance of
the binding: we are still specifying the
type of the event sequence which is
iterated, and all the clauses in the
sequence have the same t ; reference time
or witness set. In the (6) examples, on
the other hand, the description of the
iterated event is finished: there is a
discourse-level division between the
initial distributive/iterative sentence
and sentence (b), representing the end of
the rhetorical mode of generalisation-
through-singularisation, and closure of
the interval t . One indication of this
is that any pionouns occurring in the (b)
sentence, and anaphoric to distributive
NPs or their dependent expressions in the
first sentence, will necessarily be
plural. The use of a plural NP, which as
I have said represents &apos;referential
cashing out&apos;, indicates that the iterated
sequence is over and we can now assume its
completion and move on. In contrast, in
the (a) sentences anaphoric pronouns
referring to entities which were
introduced by the nominals in the
distributive/iterative sentence, are
normally singular.

6. CONCLUSIONS

<bodyText confidence="0.9999796875">
The anaphoric examples in section 4
show that both distributive and iterative
clauses enable subsequent reference to
sets of cases/events using a definite NP.
This is clearly parallel to the
possibility of using a plural anaphoric NP
to make reference to some set of
individuals (such as books), on the basis
of an original singular NP introduction.
It would seem to be desirable to account
for both kinds in terms of the same
mechanism of &apos;set construction&apos;. The
anaphoric examples also indicate a
qualitative difference between the
distribution of definite NP and pronominal
anaphora, and show that there is discourse
anaphoric access not just to the subparts
of the distributed or iterated situation,
but also to something like the whole
distributive quantification, which may be
an entity of a different kind.
The temporal binding phenomena of
section 5 give a different type of
evidence for the explanatory value of
making a generalisation of the kind
described. The observations in this
section also show that, whereas past tense
clauses describing a single situation have
a reference time with some specific
temporal referent, distributive and
iterative clauses seem to require &apos;nested
reference times&apos;, with temporal ordering
relations definable at two levels. The
Kamp/Hinrichs/Partee account needs to be
modified before it is able to incorporate
these phenomena.
I&apos;ve said that the set construction
problem is of practical importance for
computational models of natural language
interaction. In addition, the concept of
iterated action is important to planning,
so that a generalisation across
distributives and iteratives plus what has
been said about their temporal nature
should have interesting implications in
this area. If iteration is handled
computationally by setting up a loop which
embodies the instruction to repeat an
action under certain conditions, then
distributives may be handled the same way.
Distributive and iterative interpretations
may hold over stretches of discourse, the
delimitation of which is relevant to the
interpretation of temporal connectives,
and as we saw with examples (19) to (21),
in some cases anaphoric phenomena may give
clues about this delimitation, that is,
indicating when to turn off the iterative
loop. The delimitation of such discourse
chunks corresponds to the delimitation of
the extent of influence of the t or
&apos;witness set&apos;, and so anaphori in
following sentences may allow us to close
off this interval.

<abstract confidence="0.99921229262087">With the intention of indicating some temporal/event-theoretic characteristics of distributive clauses, a generalisation is made over distributives and clauses marked for iterative aspect: two kinds of semantic phenomena which have normally been confined to separate theoretical domains. It is shown that in particular, both give rise to an &apos;inferential set construction&apos; problem. An informal outline is given of what might constitute such a generalisation. The generalisation is proposed intially on grounds of prima facie plausibility, but its ultimate defensibility and explanatory value will depend on the validity of its consequence, that distributive clauses entail a multiplicity of temporal entities or events. This proposal is considered with respect to two types of discourse phenomena; anaphoric reference to event entities, and temporal binding. These provide further support for making the generalisation, clarify its nature and indicate in what respect the entailment claim can be true of distributives. The set construction problem is of practical importance for computational models of natural language interaction, and since the concept of iterated action is central to planning, the generalisation across iteration and distributives, along with the observations about their nature, have interesting implications for work in this area. 1. DISTRIBUTIVES First, three points about the body of phenomena called &apos;distributives&apos;. These are taken to be relatively uncontroversial, and are simply assumed in the rest of this paper. (i) Examples (a) and (b) in (1) illustrate the distributive/collective distinction. Essentially, sentences containing at least one plural or universally quantified NP, the denotation which might be regarded as a set, either be read in terms of the individual members of this set (as in la), or given a &apos;group&apos; reading in terms of the set as a whole (as in lb). (1)a The three girls each had a pizza. (dist) The three girls shareda pizza. (coll) It is distributivereadings which give rise to the possibility of quantifier scope ambiguities including interpretations which involve dependency relations between the NPs in the sentence. Dependency interpretations in turn allow &apos;inferential set construction&apos;. Consider example (2). Mary gave each boy A a ...and told him to look after it. They took theminto the garden to read. On the most common reading of the clause gaveeach boya book, there is a dependency relation between the two object NPs such that a is in the scope of boyand the interpretation of the former is relative to that of the latter. (2b) illustrates one type of anaphoric relation which distributive clauses may participate in: plural pronouns and definite NPs are used to refer to implicit sets of entities which instantiate variables introduced in distributive clauses by just such singular indefinite NPs in the scope of distributive NPs. So in (2b) the NP theyrefers to the set of books such that Mary gave each one to some boy. As Webber (1979, 1983) has pointed out, this anaphoric possibility represents a practical problem for computational of since a mechanism for constructing as a 16 discourse entity a set with the correct description, on the basis of the semantic representation of the initial distributive sentence containing the singular indefinite NP. Notice that singular anaphora (as in 2a) is also possible: the singular anaphor indicates the maintenance of a rhetorical mode of &apos;generalisation through singularisation&apos;, which is established by the initial distributive sentence. The pronoun it acts as a placeholder, signifying a representative member of the set of books such that Mary gave each one to some boy, and it has the status of a &apos;bound variable&apos;. Such pronouns cannot be taken to refer and I describe the contrast between them and the plural anaphors as being that the plural ones represent a &apos;referential or &apos;extensional&apos; cashing out of the initial semantic value. (iii) Sentence (2b) also indicates the possibility of using a plural pronoun theyto refer to some relevant set of boys (in contrast to (2a) where the &apos;bound variable&apos; pronoun used). However, it is not really necessary to propose a second algorithm to construct such sets because the initial, syntactically singular distributive NPs, as eachhsa, are arguably almost always themselves &apos;referential&apos; and justin sensethat the range of quantification is restricted by context. Here, the quantifier does not range over the set of all boys, but over some otherwise specified subset [&apos;host&apos; or &apos;witness set&apos; - Barwise &amp; Cooper, 1981] of boys. It can be paraphrased with the expression: each21 the boys. My intention in this paper is to explore a temporal, event-oriented perspective on distributives. The question at issue is: What are the consequences for the temporal or eventtheoretical analysis of a clause, of its being &apos;distributive&apos; in the sense defined? temporal binding. These support the hypothesised generalisation and tell us about the temporal or eventtheoretical structure of both distributives and iteratives. The observations made in this paper are confined to the past tense and to &apos;telic&apos; or &apos;bounded&apos; situation types (Mourelatos, 1981). 2. ITERATIVES following are examples iterative clauses in English: dayMary wrote a letter to her sister. time John went abroad he bought a souvenir. erupted times. Iterativity is an aspectual parameter which in English is marked mainly adverbially, with the presence of what are called &apos;frequency adverbials&apos; or &apos;temporal quantifiers&apos; (underlined in the examples). Iterative markers on a clause indicate the repetition of the event described in the clause, and also provide information about the frequency of repetition. The key requirement is couched in terms of an entailment condition: iteratives entail that there was more than one occasion on each of which an event of type E occurred, where &apos;occasion&apos; is defined as location. So there requirement of seouentialitv: that the events in question occurred on different occasions, in sequence. 3. GENERALISATION On the basis of the descriptions given in sections 1 and 2 we can argue for a generalisation over distributives and iteratives such as is represented in Figure 1 (cf. Forsyth, 1970: 154). ___ iterative multiple actions (repetition one I of a situation) I aspectual I I..... distributive parameter I single action/situation Figure 1. Generalisation over distributives and iteratives. First I indicate similarities between distributives and clauses marked with iterative aspect. I then make certain observations which apply to both distributives and iteratives, concerning two kinds of discourse phenomena: definite NP anaphora to event entities, and 17 There are a number of intuitive arguments for the prima facie plausibility of such a generalisation, two of which will be considered here. First, it is clear that from one point of view, distributives and iteratives differ just in the nature of what is where the marking of repetition is normally on the NP, involve quantification over individuals, while the temporal adverbial expressions in the iterative examples are normally taken to involve quantification over times or events. That is, the iterative markers can be seen as introducing distributive quantification. Secondly, perhaps the strongest argument for generalisation is that inferential set construction occurs with iteratives. Some iteratives, like distributives, contain indefinite NPs whose instantiations may vary across the of the event. A souvenirin (4), and a letterin example (5) are just such NPs. (4) Everytime John went abroad he A souvenir. Sometimes jwas a silver teaspoon, sometimes an antique vase. Theyjust lie around the house, cluttering it up. Each day, Mary wrote A to her sister. a It was usually ten pages long. Theywere chatty letters. Iteratives such as these manifest the same scope ambiguities as distributives and are open to the same mechanism of &apos;set construction&apos; which as we saw operates in distributive clauses on the NPs which are over. So in (4), A souvenir is in the scope of a restricted universal quantification over times, and the sentence in question could be followed by where theyrefers to the set of souvenirs such that John bought each one on some trip abroad. (4a) and (5a) show that something like the &apos;bound variable&apos; anaphora of example (2a) is possible here too. [1] expression &apos;variable binding&apos;, traditionally taken to describe an intrasentential phenomenon, is used with a less restrictive sense in this paper. The solution to the set construction problem should if possible be a general one, covering both distributive and iterative cases. The ultimate defensibility, and explanatory value, of making such a generalisation will depend on whether it accurately reflects the facts about the temporal or event-theoretical structure of distributive clauses. It was said that iterativesare customarily defined as a seauenceof events,each associated with a different occasion or spatiotemporal location. A generalisation of the kind envisaged would suggest that distributives might be regarded as having an entailment as well, and question we have to consider is whether this is so. Certainly, some distributives clearly • involve multiple occasions, that is, spatiotemporal locations. For example (6a), where it&apos;s one and the same book which is lent, and (6b). (6)a Mary lent each boy the book. b John visited each of his aunts.. On the other hand, take an example (2) above gaveeach boya h22k). This could easily describe a single occasion of giving, taking place once only. One could even imagine Mary a book to of two boys simultaneously, with either hand. Or consider (7), on the interpretation where was the same message and I did one occasion. (7) Yesterday I sent each student a message via computer mail. Intuition is clearly not enough, and in sections 4 and 5 we shall consider evidence from the discourse phenomena mentioned earlier, but first, what would constitute such a generalisation over iteratives and distributives: a which would indicate similarities and differences, and provide a way in which the entailment of multiple temporal entities/events could be said to be true of distributives? 18 [&apos;daily&apos; in event: --- *participant 1 *participant 2 *participant n *spatiotemporal location event: &apos;writing&apos; *participant 1 &apos;Mary&apos; *participant 2 &apos;her sister&apos; &apos;a letter&apos;l location Figure 2. &apos;Case&apos; specification [2] We can regard a clause as providing, one level of description, a patternor template,with specification of an event type with respect to placeholders for the following elements: one or more participants, and spatiotemporal location. Figure 2 is the skeleton of such templates or &apos;case specifications&apos;, which will be fleshed out for individual clauses. Distributive and iterative markers alike then contribute the following information: first, that there are multiple instantiations of this pattern rather than a single instantiation; and, in conjunction with other grammatical features of the clause, they provide information about which of these elements remain constant across such instantiations and which are variable. For example, take the sentence Each Mary wroteA letter1g 3). This specifies a event type which (as indicated by &apos;R&apos;) is repeatedly instantiated. Two of the participants, Mary and her sister, remain constant across these repetitions. The other participant, the letter, varies and will be instantiated by a (possibly) different entity on each occasion of There is also variation the spatiotemporal element. This element is represented here by the time variable, while the reference of the complex as a whole. It is with respect to this second kind of information, about which of the elements vary, that iteratives and distributives differ. In iterative but not in distributive clauses the spatiotemporal location will necessarily be among those elements which are variable; other elements may also vary if they are introduced by expressions in a scopal dependency relation with the temporal quantifier phrase. In &apos;Case&apos; in the sense of (1975) rather than Fillmorean Case Grammar. Figure 3. Case specification for Mary wroteA .letter12 hersister. distributives, at least one of the elements must vary the by the distributive NP and addition so may other elements, including spatiotemporal location, if they are in a dependency relation with this NP. If no other participant element is in a dependency relation with the distributive NP, that is if all other participant elements are held constant, then variation in spatiotemporal location will entail, as in example (6a). Which elements vary tells us which inferential sets to construct. The similarities between the informal proposal which has just been sketched and . Lewis&apos;s (1975) account of temporal in terms of caseswill be obvious. Lewis defines a case as an nof its Participants(i.e. the values of free variables in the sentence) and a timecoordinate [the &apos;case specifications&apos; represented above include in addition an event type label, such as &apos;writing&apos;]. He argues that iterative markers involve quantification over cases rather than over times or events. My proposal could be interpreted as a claim that we can extend some version of a case analysis to include distributives: these, too, would be taken involve quantification over Quantification over times or participants would then represent particular ways of realising the multiple instantiation of the case. The advantages of an account such as this are that it allows generalisation over a wide variety of phenomena, including numerous ways of marking iteration or distribution on the clause, and that it provides an appropriate level of description to be referred to in accounting for discourse anaphoric relations. The question of the individuation of events is a controversial one, and the terms &apos;event&apos; and &apos;event type&apos; have so far been used rather loosely. Suppose we first follow Mourelatos (1981) in making a distinction between events and the spatiotemporal locations with which they are associated, and secondly, suggest that 19 events should be regarded as particular instantiations of case specifications of the type described. Then iteratives entail a multiplicity of cases/events + spatiotemporal locations (which are in some isomorphic relationship), whereas distributives likewise entail a multiplicity of cases/events, but merely allow the possibility of multiple spatiotemporal locations (i.e., events and spatiotemporal locations may not be in an isomorphic relationship) as we shall see, in the case of any particular distributive, this question may be resolved by following anaphoric reference. 4. ANAPHORIC REFERENCE TO EVENTS (8) John visited each of his great aunts. Ih.g. visitswere much appreciated by the old ladies. occasionswere a source of torment to him. (9) Everytime John went to Namibia he visited an old friend. He found the visitsdistressing. He was upset on occasions. Examples (8) and (9) indicate that after a distributive or iterative clause, speakers can refer using a plural definite NP, to a set of entities which are something like &apos;events&apos; or &apos;occasions&apos; and appear to correspond to distributive or iterated situation of the preceding clause. Note the two types of example (a and b): in the first, the common noun head of the anaphoric expression is a nominalisation of the verb in the antecedent sentence (such NPs are normally taken to refer to event entities); in the second the noun is a much more general one. Both kinds of example appear to represent a phenomenon of the same type as the inferential set construction described in section 1: it is as if the initial distributive or iterative clause introduces an &apos;event&apos; variable and the anaphoric NPs represent a referential/extensional cashing out of this. Continuing the parallel with anaphoric reference to nominally-introduced entities, example (10) shows that with respect to event entities too, singular anaphoric NPs occur which are of the variable&apos; type. Thus in (10) visitsignifies a representative event of the type described: (10) John visited each of his maiden aunts, but the visit didn&apos;t make him popular with any of them. A second type of singular anaphora occurs, as in (11): in this case the anaphoric pronoun that appears to refer to the whole distributive episode, of John visiting each aunt, described in the preceding clause. (11) John visited each of his aunts. That was a thoughtful thing to do. Finally, examples (12) and (13) show that, although plural definite NPs can be used to access the set of events or occasions resulting from distributive/iterative clauses (as in (8) (9)), plural pronounscannot. In (12) theyand themcan only be interpreted with reference to the aunts compare the same sentences with the pronouns replaced by NP visits.Explanation of this, which there is not space to elaborate here, must take account of the obvious that a requirement of is involved. Meanwhile the important point to note is the clear distinction between the distribution of definite NP and pronominal anaphors. (12) John visited each of his aunts. * Theywere a dismal failure. b * He had a good time on all of tiara. c * Each of them went well. (13) John flew to Paris twice. He enjoyed both trips. *He enjoyed bothof them. (11) shows that pronominal reference does occur, but this seeming inconsistency may be explained in terms of the nature of the entity being referred to: the plural NPs seem to refer to events whereas the singular ones refer to &apos;facts&apos; or &apos;propositions (in the sense of the distinction argued for in Vendler (1967)). [3] [3] There is clearly much more to be 20 5. TEMPORAL BINDING PHENOMENA First it is necessary to review some claims of theories of temporal reference. Consider the following example: (14) When John made the cake, he broke the oven. When,like other &apos;temporal such as beforeand after, indicates a particular relationship between the two clauses it connects: normally such relationships are considered to consist in specification of the relative ordering in time of the two events described by these clauses. The basic claim, then, is that such connectives give a specification of a kind of &apos;temporal binding between the two clauses such that the reference time of one is dependent on that of the other. This claim is independent of the particular nature of the ordering or binding hypothesised. (This idea is clearly on a par with claims that certain temporal phenomena should be understood on analogy with nominal anaphora, for example that the (past) tense morpheme should be taken to refer to a time, and to receive its reference either from some antecedent tense morpheme in the text, or from some adverbial expression, or deictically.) Kamp (1979), Hinrichs (1982)L and Partee (1984), who subscribe to a discourse theory of temporal (ordering) relations, argue that (in narrative discourse) the reference time of any main clause will be dependent on that of the preceding clause; that is, that just the same kinds of temporal binding dependencies occur at the level of discourse, between clauses which are syntactically independent as well as between those which are linked by temporal connectives. With this background, we can consider clauses which involve iteration, marked by temporal quantification, in addition to temporal connection of the type just described. For example (15). (15) When Max left the office, he the lights off. It seems that such sentences respect to the phenomena examined in this section; this will be dealt with in forthcoming work. constitute a binding or dependency, between two clauses describing distinct types of event, which puts a condition on the pairwise mapping of instantiations of such events. Thus, in this case, every event of Max leaving the office is said to have been paired with (at least one) event of his turning the lights off. This kind of dependency relation seems to be exactly parallel to that which holds between the NP each girland the NP A bookin caveeach airlA 1:)ook.In terms of the schema in Figures 2 and 3, binding is of the variable of clause one, and clause two. Notice that the when clause restricts the range of the iterative quantifier alwaysin the following clause. Examples like (15) are a special case of temporal quantification in that the condition on the range of quantification is explicitly stated in the subordinate clause. But it is true in general that temporal like alwaysor each time do not range over all of time, but over some contextually fixed interval. They thus conform to the claim made in section 1 that distributive NPs normally have their range of quantification restricted to some otherwise-specified &apos;witness set&apos;. The reference time t of Figure 3 represents this kind of witness set. The main point to be made in this is that distributiveclauses, with no explicit temporal quantification, can also act as sources for temporal binding, and restrict the range of subsequent temporal quantification, in just the same way that the iteratfve clauses do. Hence we find examples like (16) and (17). (16) Mary gave each boy a book. Sometimesthe boy thanked her, but poreoften he did not. (17) Harry invited each of his relatives to stay. On each occasion he bought in enough food to feed an army. Here, the range of the quantifier moreoften and on each occasionis restricted by the set of events determined by the preceding distributive clause that is, by something like the set of instantiations of the case specification, perhaps more specifically, instantiations of the temporal variable t . There is binding between the event N described in the two sentences: in (16) some of the &apos;times&apos; (occasions) on which Mary gave some boy a 21 book are such that the boy in question thanked her; in (17) each occasion on which Harryts relatives came to stay is paired with an event of his buying in lots of food. Example (18), which is from a university library photocopying machine, is exactly parallel to the temporally quantified and connected example given in Here, eachplays the same role as alwaysdoes in (15). (18) Please wait until machine is silent beforeinserting each5p coin. This example is (theoretically) ambiguous in the scope of the distributive marker: does the first clause represent a condition for the iterated event, so that we are to wait until the machine is silent and then insert all the 5ps one after another, or is it part of an iterated condition + event sequence, so that on each occasion of inserting 5p, we must wait until the machine is silent first? (In actuality, it is of course the second reading which is intended.) Now consider the following examples, another temporal connective, (19) Mary gave each boy a book. a Then she marked his name off her list as having received it. b Then she dismissed them. (20) Everytime John went abroad he brought back a souvenir. a Then he put it in the cupboard with the rest of them. b Then he stopped going abroad and threw them all away. These examples indicate that the initial distributive or iterative sentence can be viewed either in terms of its unity as a complex situation, or in terms of the constituent phases which that total comprises (cf. examples (8) and (11) in section 4). Hence in (19) the reference time of (b), the dismissal, will be after the completion of the complex event of giving out books, (in terms of the case specification in Figures 2 and 3 the t of (b) will be after the t of the iniEial sentence). In contrast, the sequence in (19a) is such that the then clause is &apos;in the scope of&apos; the distributive and there is a pairwise binding between the event type of giving out a book and the event type of marking off a name, such that each instantiation of the former will be followed by an instantiation of the latter. That is, there is a temporal ordering condition on the temporal variables t of the two clauses. The whole sequXnce will have the same t,; overall reference time or &apos;witness set*. If we regard temporal connectives as indicating a relationship defined over reference times, then we are put in the position of recognising two possibilities with respect to distributive/iterative sentences: these seem to involve something like &apos;nested reference times&apos;, with the ordering relation being able to over either Consider also examples (21) and (22). (21) Mary gave each boy a book. a On each occasion the boy thanked her. b On that occasion they were grateful to her. (22) John visited each of his maiden aunts. Each one gave him a cup of tea. Example (22) is particularly interesting, because we have a sequence of two clauses which are not syntactically linked by a temporal connective, and neither of which contains a temporal quantifier phrase. Yet there is an implication that there is a pairwise dependency relation between teas and visits. The generalised binding relationship appears to hold across the sentence boundary, just as Kamp, Hinrichs and Partee postulated with respect to ordering relations between clauses describing single rather than repeated situations. Any analysis of this discourse which assigns each sentence a single reference time, and which then, following Hinrichs and Partee, requires that the reference time for the second follow that of the first, will give the wrong results. [4] The observations which have been made evince a close analogy with the facts of [4] Their response to this might be that we are not here dealing with narrative discourse, a denial which is more plausibly made of earlier examples, or even (19) or (20), than it is of (22). 22. nominal anaphora which were outlined in section 1 of the paper. The (a) examples in (19), (20) and (21) in each case represent something like maintenance of the binding: we are still specifying the type of the event sequence which is iterated, and all the clauses in the sequence have the same t ; reference time or witness set. In the (6) examples, on the other hand, the description of the iterated event is finished: there is a discourse-level division between the initial distributive/iterative sentence and sentence (b), representing the end of the rhetorical mode of generalisationthrough-singularisation, and closure of the interval t . One indication of this is that any pionouns occurring in the (b) sentence, and anaphoric to distributive their dependent expressions in the first sentence, will necessarily be plural. The use of a plural NP, which as I have said represents &apos;referential cashing out&apos;, indicates that the iterated sequence is over and we can now assume its completion and move on. In contrast, in the (a) sentences anaphoric pronouns referring to entities which were introduced by the nominals in the distributive/iterative sentence, are normally singular. The anaphoric examples in section 4 show that both distributive and iterative clauses enable subsequent reference to sets of cases/events using a definite NP. This is clearly parallel to the possibility of using a plural anaphoric NP to make reference to some set of individuals (such as books), on the basis</abstract>

However, it is not really necessary to propose a second algorithm to construct such sets because the initial, syntactically singular distributive NPs, such as each hsa, are arguably almost always themselves &apos;referential&apos; and &apos;anaphoric&apos;, just in the sense that the range of quantification is restricted by context. Here, the quantifier does not range over the set of all boys, but over some otherwise specified subset [&apos;host&apos; or &apos;witness set&apos; - Barwise &amp; Cooper, 1981] of boys. It can be paraphrased with the partitive expression: each 21 the boys. My intention in this paper is to explore a temporal, event-oriented perspective on distributives. The question at issue is: What are the consequences for the temporal or eventtheoretical analysis of a clause, of its being &apos;distributive&apos; in the sense defined? temporal binding.

So there is a necessary requirement of seouentialitv: that the events in question occurred on different occasions, in sequence. 3.

These support the hypothesised generalisation and tell us something about the temporal or eventtheoretical structure of both distributives and iteratives.

ITERATIVES The following are examples of iterative clauses in English: (3)a Each day Mary wrote a letter to her sister. b Every time John went abroad he bought a souvenir. Vesuvius erupted three times. Iterativity is an aspectual parameter which in English is marked mainly adverbially, with the presence of what are called &apos;frequency adverbials&apos; or &apos;temporal quantifiers&apos; (underlined in the examples). Iterative markers on a clause indicate the repetition of the event described in the clause, and also provide information about the frequency of repetition.

The advantages of an account such as this are that it allows generalisation over a wide variety of phenomena, including numerous ways of marking iteration or distribution on the clause, and that it provides an appropriate level of description to be referred to in accounting for discourse anaphoric relations. The question of the individuation of events is a controversial one, and the terms &apos;event&apos; and &apos;event type&apos; have so far been used rather loosely. Suppose we first follow Mourelatos (1981) in making a distinction between events and the spatiotemporal locations with which they are associated, and secondly, suggest that 19 events should be regarded as particular instantiations of case specifications of the type described. Then iteratives entail a multiplicity of cases/events + spatiotemporal locations (which are in some isomorphic relationship), whereas distributives likewise entail a multiplicity of cases/events, but merely allow the possibility of multiple spatiotemporal locations (i.e., events and spatiotemporal locations may not be in an isomorphic relationship) - as we shall</context>

(2b) illustrates one type of anaphoric relation which distributive clauses may participate in: plural pronouns and definite NPs are used to refer to implicit sets of entities which instantiate variables introduced in distributive clauses by just such singular indefinite NPs in the scope of distributive NPs. So in (2b) the underlined NP they refers to the set of books such that Mary gave each one to some boy. As Webber (1979, 1983) has pointed out, this anaphoric possibility represents a practical problem for computational accounts of .discourse, since a mechanism is required for constructing as a 16 discourse entity a set with the correct description, on the basis of the semantic representation of the initial distributive sentence containing the singular indefinite NP. Notice that singular anaphora (as in 2a) is also possible: the singular anaphor indicates the maintenance of a rhetorical mode of &apos;generalisation through singularisation&apos;, which is established by the initial distributive sentence.
