PREFACE
The Twenty-Fifth Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics offers the

membership a chance to acknowledge and benefit from the wide range of developments in compu-
tational linguistics in the past several years. The papers in the program reflect the growing in-
teraction between computational linguists trained in information processing approaches and
those trained in linguistic disciplines. At the same time the program&apos;s papers report on new
developments in many areas of computational linguistics that are now the forefront of research in
our field.
Because of the exponentially increasing number of papers submitted this year, the committee
chose to reduce the number of panels and invited talks in favor of accepting additional papers.
The panel on Directions for Natural Language Processing will provide the membership with a
chance to assess current developments in the field and their potential for the next several years.
The invited talk on Speech Act Theory will update the membership in depth on one part of our
field that shows special promise for natural language processing. At the same time, this year&apos;s
tutorials have been planned to provide the membership with lectures in areas of computational
linguistics that complement those being studied during the courses at the 1987 Linguistic Insti-
tute at Stanford University.
The Public Forum on Evaluating Natural Language Systems is a special part of this year&apos;s
program. It permits all of the membership to participate in the examination of a set of issues
that are pressing to every one in the community, no matter what their particular specialty may
be. It is my hope that this forum will further research and practical measures on evaluating all
aspects of natural language systems. The forum is also an experiment in programming for an an-
nual meeting because of its unusual scheduling structure.
This year&apos;s meeting is the product of a number of members&apos; talent, time and hard work (in
all combinations of those terms!). I am indebted to the Program Committee for their contribu-
tions to the content of the program. It is no small task to read and understand the large number
of papers submitted, and the committee covered the papers with great care. My thanks to them:
Robert Berwick, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Julia Hirschberg, AT&amp;T Bell Labora-
tories; Aravind Joshi, University of Pennsylvania; Janet Kolodner, Georgia Institute of Technolo-
gy; Paul Martin, SRI International; Kathleen McKeown, Columbia University; James Meehan,
Cognitive Systems Inc.; Sergei Nirenberg, Carnegie-Mellon University; Martha Palmer, UNISYS;
C. Raymond Perrault, SRI International.
Special thanks to Dan Flickenger, Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, and Jerry Hobbs, SRI
International, for organizing the Forum on Evaluating Natural Language Systems. I also wish to
express my appreciation to Hewlett-Packard, Inc. for sponsoring the reception following the
Forum.
This year&apos;s annual meeting could not have taken place without the organizational talents
and energy of several ACL members, in particular Douglas Appelt of SRI International who was
responsible for local arrangements, Paul Martin of SRI International who organized the exhibits
program, and Joyce Friedman of Boston University who put together the Tutorials Program.
Bill Mann, USC/Information Sciences Institute, the ACL President, has provided me with useful
advice on many aspects of the program. Ivan Sag, Stanford University, was particularly helpful
in co-ordinating this year&apos;s meeting with the 1987 Linguistic Institute. I also want to ack-
nowledge the special assistance of my secretary, Rachel Moser, for invaluable organizational and
secretarial help with the papers submitted.
I wish to extend a very special thanks to Don Walker, Bell Communications Research, the
ACL Secretary-Treasurer. Until I became program chair, I was unaware of just how much effort
Don invests at every stage of the meeting, from advertising the Call for Papers to publishing the
schedule and registration information for the meeting to producing the Proceedings (as well as
much, much more). This meeting could not have taken place without him.
