Since the mid-1960s, the development of Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) can be followed
in Russian, French, and English publications. The main authors of this theory are
I. A. Mereuk and A. K. 2olkowskij, the first works with a more global insight into MTT
being 2olkowskij and Mert&apos;uk (1965, 1967). Since that time, MTT has been developing
and has brought considerable results. Nowadays, there are hundreds of works dealing
with MTT.
The book Meaning-Text Theory, edited by J. Steele, consists of thirteen articles and
three appendices. All the articles are linked by one topic—MTT. Most were written for
the book; three were translated and/or adopted from other publications. The articles
are grouped in three parts:

Except for A.R. Luria (a deceased Soviet psychologist), the nine authors are from
universities in Canada and the U.S. They were brought together by a deep interest in
MTT and by their efforts made to apply MIT to English.
For those readers who do not know MTT yet, Alexander Nakhimovsky sums up
its essence (&amp;quot;Word Meaning and Syntactic Structure: Some Comparative Notes,&amp;quot; pp. 3-
17). He lists the levels that constitute the language description in the framework of
MTT, and focuses his attention on the concepts of semantic and syntactic valence. He
describes the starting points of MTT and compares some of the most general features
of MTT with both older and more recent theories of Chomsky. (By mistake, obviously,
not all Chomsky&apos;s works quoted in Nakhimovsky&apos;s text are given in the bibliography.
Those missing are Chomsky&apos;s works of 1965, 1972, and 1977.) In view of the content
of the articles in Part 2 of the book, the concise description of the MTT lexical entry
included in this article appears somewhat redundant.
Johanna Nichols, in her article &amp;quot;The Meeting of East and West: Confrontation and
Convergence in Contemporary Linguistics&amp;quot; (pp. 18-37), published originally in 1979,
offers a hypothesis that two opposing linguistic theories of the 20th century, namely
structural linguistics and generative linguistics, show evidence of convergence. As
representative of structural linguistics, she chooses traditional Russian grammars. She
lists and explains phenomena in which, even today, the two schools differ conspic-

uously and, at the same time, brings evidence that in interpreting some phenomena
(e.g., the position of subject and object in a sentence; semantic roles) both of these
schools developed similarly. This development is, according to her view, spontaneous,
without evidence of mutual influence. The author fails to offer any hypothesis explain-
ing this fact. (The meaning of the words east and west is relative, of course. It changes
according to where the speaker is at the moment of speaking. Nevertheless, I do not
consider it fortunate that the label east is attributed to structuralism.)
The key component of MTT is an explanatory combinatorial dictionary (ECD),
which constitutes the tool for organizing lexical information. The ECD unit is the en-
try describing one lexeme. A higher unit is the super-entry describing one vocable.
Semantic and collocational relations between lexemes are described in the ECD by
means of lexical functions. They provide a powerful tool for the general and system-
atic description of many substitutions and collocations that might otherwise appear
singular and irregular. J. Steele and I. Meyer state in their article &amp;quot;Lexical Functions
in an Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary: Kinds, Descriptions, and English Exam-
ples&amp;quot; (pp. 41-61) that more than 60 lexical functions described in various works of
Mel&apos;aik and 2olkowskij had been identified so far. The lexical functions had been
widely exemplified in the Russian and French languages. The objective of the article
is to exemplify the lexical functions in English and classify them in such a way as to
make it possible to group them into easily remembered groups. The fact that lexical
functions are identified intuitively in the MTT and that they are universal for all lan-
guages is not stated explicitly in the article; neither is it stated explicitly that we can
never say that all the lexical functions have already been identified. This important
information can be found in some previous works by 2olkowskij and Menuk (e.g.,
1965, 1967).
To my knowledge, three ECD volumes have so far been published: one concerning
the Russian language (Mel&apos;aik and 2olkowskij 1984) and two concerning the French
language (Mer6uk et al. 1984, 1988). The third volume devoted to French should
appear in 1991. The first and second volumes of the French dictionary were accompa-
nied by a French article by L. Elnitsky explaining the structure of an entry in the ECD.
I. Meyer and J. Steele translated these two articles into English and completed them.
The resulting article, &amp;quot;The Presentation of an Entry and Super-Entry in an ECD of
English&amp;quot; (pp. 62-94), describes and illustrates in great detail, and with great precision
and intelligibility, the structure of an entry and a super-entry.
After these follow the articles by I. Mackenzie (pp. 95-130), J. Steele (pp. 131-
158), and Z. Chen (pp. 159-174) presenting the super-entries escape, hope, teach, and
teaching for an ECD of English. In the book there is no mention of any team of authors
preparing an ECD of English. Consequently, it cannot be decided whether the above
four vocables constitute an isolated probe or a component of an ECD of English in
preparation.
I consider the article by I. Meyer &amp;quot;Interlingual Meaning-Text Lexicography: To-
wards a New Type of Dictionary for Translation&amp;quot; (pp. 175-270) to be the crucial one.
It is a summary of her Ph.D. dissertation directed by Mel&apos;6uk. It contains global in-
formation on the ECD as well as a proposal for a model for a new type of bilingual
dictionary based on ECD principles for the translation from native into non-native
languages. The ECD had not been originally conceived as a commercial dictionary. It
was rather intended to be a theoretical lexicon, an integral part of the scientific de-
scription of a given language. One of the reasons for this was that it was considered
to be absolutely unacceptable to publish the ECD in the scope of a large dictionary.
It is only thanks to recent technology that the barriers of the book have been bro-

ken and huge dictionary material can be stored on a CD in such a way as to give
the user easy and rapid access to the information required. Thus, the technology en-
ables commercialization of the ECD and also the bilingual dictionary based on this
model.
The great amount of work that has to be done to c reate a large bilingual dictionary
based on the ECD model (containing, e.g., 100,000 super-entries) can be figured from
the one illustrative super-entry processed by Meyer and included in her article: the
super-entry tete and its English equivalents. This one bilingual super-entry takes 72
pages. From the super-entry, we can infer the structure of the future bilingual dic-
tionary based on the ECD and see the matching complexities existing between any
source-language and target-language pair.
In keeping with the ECD tradition, it is introspection that is favored as the prin-
cipal source of lexicographic evidence. During the initial compilation of the entry
tete, the author started from her own linguistic intuition and from her skill in trans-
lating from French into English. She combined her intuition with the information
found in a number of dictionaries and reference works, and had the result of her ini-
tial compilation verified and modified by 19 informants. The result of this extensive
work is impressive. Each translator would like to have such a dictionary at his/her
disposal.
The third part of the book is devoted to neuropsychology, computational linguis-
tics, and language learning in connection with the MTT. The article by A.R. Luria,
&amp;quot;The Problem of Verbal Communication&amp;quot; (pp. 273-324), was published as early as
1979. Luria believes that the MTT represents an important advance towards the expla-
nation of neuropsychological processes involved in speech production. He proposes
a hypothesis that the number of lexical functions points broadly to the amount of
semantic connection between words.
A. Nakhimovsky (&amp;quot;A Lexicon-Based Algorithm for Ambiguity Resolution in Pars-
ing,&amp;quot; pp. 326-349) draws attention to the fact that some information given in the ECD
can be used in solving some problems of syntactic ambiguity in computer text pro-
cessing. It can be added that in a number of experiments in machine translation in
Europe, syntactic verbal valence is used in a process of text analysis, even though some
theory other than the MTT might constitute the theoretical linguistic background for
the algorithm.
The article by J. E. Grimes (pp. 350-364) is devoted to the notion of inverse lexical
function. The idea that the notion of lexical function can be used by language teachers
to help students learn proper lexical collocations and develop a richer vocabulary is
treated in the article by R. L. Leed and A. Nakhimovsky, &amp;quot;Lexical Functions and Lan-
guage Learning&amp;quot; (pp. 365-375). According to Steele (&amp;quot;Meaning-Text Theory and First
Language Learning: Some Implications,&amp;quot; pp. 376-390), knowledge of lexical functions
will help English students enlarge their vocabulary and, unlike the mere acquisition
of a sentence-forming capability, it will enable them to master the English language.
The bibliography of works on MTT in English and French published before 1990
is given in Appendix 3 (pp. 417-432). Its authors are Steele and Meyer. There are 139
English works and 41 French works included in the bibliography. More correctly, there
should be 40 French works only; the work by Tesniere (Elements de Syntaxe Structurale,
Paris, 1966) must have been one of the starting points for the authors of the MTT,
but it can, however, hardly be considered a work on MTT. The transliteration of the
authors&apos; names from the Cyrillic alphabet is not uniform (e.g., Apresjan—Apresyan, ge&apos;eg-
lov—Shcheglov,2olkovskij—Zholkovsky). The transliteration chosen is probably in harmony
with that used by each author in their work.

There are a number of interesting projects in present-day lexicography, the most
interesting being, to my mind, the Collins COB LIILD English Language Dictionary and the
project of the bilingual dictionary based on ECD principles. In Meaning-Text Theory,
the reader has the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the latter for the first
time. Nor should the book escape the notice of those dealing with lexical semantics
and looking for the ways that contrastive lexicology should take in the future.
