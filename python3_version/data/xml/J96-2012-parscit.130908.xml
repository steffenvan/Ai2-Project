The Generative Lexicon presents a
novel and exciting theory of
lexical semantics that addresses
the problem of the &amp;quot;multiplicity
of word meaning.&amp;quot;. The first
formally elaborated theory of a
generative approach to word
meaning, it lays the foundation
for an implemented computa-
tional treatment of word
meaning that connects explicitly
to a compositional semantics.

This study proposes a new theory of
speech acts, Dynamic Speech Act Theory.
It is predicated on the assumption that
speech act theory, if it is to be of genuine
empirical and theoretical significance,
must be embedded within a general
theory of conversational competence
capable of accounting for how we do
things with words in naturally occurring
conversation, and it synthesizes traditional
speech act theory, conversation analysis,
and artificial intelligence research in
natural language processing.

This interdisciplinary book investigates the central component of
natural language processing: the lexicon. In integrating linguistic,
psycholinguistic, and computational approaches towards the
lexicon, a mental model is developed which serves as the basis
of an efficient lexicon implementation. This volume is meant for
linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists, and all who are
interested in natural language phenomena.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.93528725">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.965571">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99749225">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.

It is predicated on the assumption that speech act theory, if it is to be of genuine empirical and theoretical significance, must be embedded within a general theory of conversational competence capable of accounting for how we do things with words in naturally occurring conversation, and it synthesizes traditional speech act theory, conversation analysis, and artificial intelligence research in natural language processing.</abstract>

The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. to the Editor: category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.

<abstract confidence="0.693973571428572">Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
