Our paper discusses the potential use of
Web Content Mining techniques for gath-
ering scientific social information from the
homepages of researchers. We will intro-
duce our system which seeks [affiliation,
position, start year, end year] information
tuples on these homepages along with pre-
liminary experimental results. We believe
that the lessons learnt from these experi-
ments may be useful for further scientific
social web mining.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944279069767">
Scientific social network analysis (Yang et al.,
2009; Said et al., 2008) seeks to discover global
patterns in the network of researchers working in
a particular field. Common approaches uses bibli-
ographic/scholarly data as the basis for this anal-
ysis. In this paper, we will discuss the poten-
tial of exploiting other resources as an informa-
tion source, such as the homepages of researchers.
The homepage of a researcher contains several
useful pieces of scientific social information like
the name of their supervisor, affiliations, academic
ranking and so on.
The information on homepages may be present
in a structured or natural text form. Here we
shall focus on the detection and analysis of full
text regions of the homepages as they may con-
tain a huge amount of information while requires
more sophisticated analysis than that for struc-
tured ones. We will show that this kind of Web-
based Relation Extraction requires different tech-
niques than the state-of-the-art seed-based ap-
proaches as it has to acquire information from the
long-tail of the World Wide Web.
As a case study, we chose one particular sci-
entific social information type and sought to ex-
tract information tuples concerning the previous
and current affiliations of the researcher in ques-
tion. We defined ’affiliation’ as the current and
previous physical workplaces and higher edu-
cational institutes of the researcher in question.
Our aim is to use this kind of information to
discover collegial relationships and workplace-
changing behaviour which may be complementary
to the items of information originating from bibli-
ographic databases.
Based on a manually annotated corpus we car-
ried out several information extraction experi-
ments. The architecture of the complex system
and the recognised problems will be discussed in
Section 3, while our empirical results will be pre-
sented in Section 4. In the last two sections we
will briefly discuss our results and then draw our
main conclusions.

Scientific social network analysis has become a
growing area in recent years ((Yang et al., 2009;
Robardet and Fleury, 2009; Said et al., 2008)
just to name a few in recent studies). Its goal is
to provide a deeper insight into a research field
or into the personal connections among fields by
analysing relationships among researchers. The
existing studies use the co-authorship (e.g. (New-
man, 2001; Barab´asi et al., 2002)) or/and the cita-
tion (Goodrum et al., 2001; Teufel et al., 2006) in-
formation – generally by constructing a graph with
nodes representing researchers – as the basis for
their investigations.

homepage of a researchers where they summarise
their topic of interest, list supervisors and students,
nationality, age, memberships and so on. Our goal
is to develop an automatic Web Content Mining
system which crawls the homepages of researchers
and extracts useful social information from them.
A case study will be outlined here, where the
previous and current affiliations of the researcher
in question were gathered automatically. Having
a list of normalised affiliations for each researcher
of a field (i) we ought to be able to discover col-
legial relationships (whether they worked with the
same group at the same time) which may differ
from the co-authorship relation and (ii) we hope
to be able to answer questions like ’Do American
or European researchers change their workplace
more often?’.

2.2 Information extraction from homepages
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980672727273">
From a technology point of view our procedure
is a Web Content Mining tool, but it differs from
the popular techniques used nowadays. The aim
of Web Content Mining (Liu and Chen-Chuan-
Chang, 2004) is to extract useful information from
the natural language-written parts of websites.
The first attempts on Web Content Mining be-
gan with the Internet around 1998-’99 (Adelberg,
1998; Califf and Mooney, 1999; Freitag, 1998;
Kosala and Blockeel, 2000). They were expert
systems with hand-crafted rules or induced rules
used in a supervised manner and based on labeled
corpora.
The next generation of approaches on the other
hand work in weakly-supervised settings (Etzioni
et al., 2005; Sekine, 2006; Bellare et al., 2007).
Here, the input is a seed list of target information
pairs and the goal is to gather a set of pairs which
are related to each other in the same manner as the
seed pairs. These pairs may contain related enti-
ties (for example, country - capital city in (Etzioni
et al., 2005) and celebrity partnerships in (Cheng
et al., 2009)) or form an entity-attribute pair (like
Nobel Prize recipient - year in (Feiyu Xu, 2007))
or may be concerned with retrieving all available
attributes for entities (Bellare et al., 2007; Pas¸ca,
2009). These systems generally download web
pages which contain the seed pairs then learn syn-
tactical/semantical rules from the sentences of the
pairs (they generally use the positive instances for
one case as negative instances for another case).
According to these patterns, they can download a
new set of web pages and parse them to acquire
new pairs.
These seed-based systems exploit the redun-
dancy of the WWW. They are based on the hy-
pothesis that important information can be found
at several places and in several forms on the Web,
hence a few accurate rules can be used to collect
the required lists. Their goal is to find and recog-
nise (at least) one occurrence of the target infor-
mation and not to find their every occurrence on
the Web. But this is not the case in our scenario.
Several pieces of social information for the re-
searchers are available just on their homepages (or
nowhere). Thus here we must capture each men-
tion of the information. The weakly-supervised
(redundancy-based) systems can build on high-
precision and lower recall information extraction,
while we have to have target a perfect recall. For
the evaluation of such a system we constructed a
manually annotated corpus of researchers’ home-
pages. This corpus was also used as a training cor-
pus for the preliminary information extraction ex-
periments described in this paper.

3 The architecture of the system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919266666667">
The general task of our system is to gather sci-
entific social information from the homepages of
researchers. In the use case presented in this pa-
per, the input is a set of researchers’ names who
work in a particular research field (later on, this
list can be automatically gathered, for example,
from a call for papers) and the output is a list of
affiliations for each researcher. Here the affiliation
is a tuple of affiliation, position type and start/end
dates. We think that the lessons learnt from affili-
ation extraction will be useful for the development
of a general social information extraction system.
The system has to solve several subproblems
which will be described in the following subsec-
tions.

Homepage candidates can be efficiently found by
using web search engine queries for the given
name. In our case study the homepage of the
researcher (when it existed) were among the top
10 responses of the Google API1 in each case.
However, selecting the correct homepage from
the top 10 responses is a harder task. Among

these sites there are (i) publication-related ones
(books/articles written by the researchers, call for
papers), sites of the institute/group associated with
the researcher and (ii) homepages of people shar-
ing the same name.
In our preliminary experiments, we ignored
these two basic problems and automatically parsed
each website. However in the future we plan to
develop a two-stage approach to solve them. In
the first stage a general homepage detection model
– a binary classification problem with classes
homepage/non-homepage – will be applied.
In the second stage we will attempt to automati-
cally extract textual clues for the relations among
the researchers (e.g. the particular field they work
in) from the homepage candidates and utilise these
cues for name disambiguation along with other bi-
ographical cues. For a survey of state-of-the-art
name disambiguation, see (Artiles et al., 2009).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999819">
3.2 Locating the relevant parts of the site
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944304347826">
The URL got from the search engine usually
points to the main page of the homepage site. An
ideal system should automatically find every page
which might contain scientific social information
like Curriculum Vitae, Research interests, Projects
etc. This can be done by analysing the text of the
links or even the linked page. In our case study we
simply parsed the pages to a depth of 1 (i.e. the
main page and each page which was linked from
it).
The located web pages usually have their con-
tent arranged in sections. The first step of infor-
mation extraction may be a relevant section se-
lection module. For example, in the affiliation
extraction task the Positions Held and Education
type sections are relevant while Selected Papers
is not. Having several relevant sections with their
textual positions, an automatic classification sys-
tem can filter out a huge number of probably irrel-
evant sections. In our experiments, we statistically
collected a few ”relevant keywords” and filtered
out sections and paragraphs which did not contain
any of these keywords.

3.3 Extracting information tuples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999723413793104">
Pieces of scientific social information are usually
present on the homepages and in the CVs even in
an itemised (structured) form or in a natural lan-
guage full text form. Information extraction is
performed from the structured parts of the docu-
ments by automatically constructed rules based on
the HTML tags and keywords. This field is called
Wrapper Induction (Kushmerick, 2000).
We shall focus on the information extraction
from raw texts here because we found that more
pages express content in textual form than in a
structured one in the researchers’ homepages of
our case study and this task still has several un-
solved problems. We mentioned above that sci-
entific social information extraction has to cap-
ture each occurrence of the target information.
We manually labeled homepages for the evalua-
tion of these systems. We think that the DOM
structure of the homepages (e.g. formatting tags,
section headers) could provide useful information,
hence the labeling was carried out in their origi-
nal HTML form (Farkas et al., 2008). In our pre-
liminary experiments we also used this corpus to
train classification models (they were evaluated in
a one-researcher-leave-out scheme). The purpose
of these supervised experiments was to gain an in-
sight into the nature of the problem, but we suggest
that a real-world system for this task should work
in a weakly-supervised setting.

The output of the extraction phase outlined above
is a list of affiliations for each researcher in the
form that occurred in the documents. However, for
scientific social network analysis, several normal-
isation steps should be performed. For example,
for collegial relationship extraction, along with
the matching of various transliteration of research
groups (like Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and MITAI Lab), we have to identify the appropri-
ate institutional level where two researchers prob-
ably still have a personal contact as well.

We manually constructed a web page corpus

dent annotators carried out their manual labeling
in the original (HTML) format of the web pages,
following an annotation guideline (Farkas et al.,
2008). All the labels that were judged inconsis-
tent were collected together from the corpus for a
review by the two annotators and the chief annota-
tor. We defined a three-level deep annotation hier-
archy with 44 classes (labels). The wide range of
the labels and the inter-annotator agreement both
suggest that the automatic reproduction of this full
labelling is a hard task.
We selected one particular information class,
namely affiliation from our class hierarchy for our
case study. We defined ’affiliation’ as the current
and previous physical workplaces and higher ed-
ucational institutes of the researcher in question
as we would like to use this kind of information
to discover collegial relationships and workplace-
changing behaviour. Here institutes related to re-
view activities, awards, or memberships are not re-
garded as affiliations. We call position the tu-
ple of &lt;affiliation, position types,
years&gt;, as for example in &lt;National Depart-
ment of Computer Science and Operational Re-
search at the University of Montreal, adjunct Pro-
fessor, 11995, 20021&gt;3. Among the four slots
just the affiliation slot is mandatory (it is
the head) as the others are usually missing in real
homepages.
The problem of finding the relevant pages of a
homepage site originating from a seed URL was
not addressed in this study. We found that pages
holding affiliation information was the one re-
trieved by Google in 135 cases and directly linked
to the main page in 50 cases. We found affilia-
tion information for all of the 89 researchers of our
case study in the depth of 1, but we did not check
whether deeper crawling could have yielded new
information.
The affiliation information (like every piece of
scientific social information) can be present on
web pages in an itemised or natural text format.
We manually investigated our corpus and found
that the 47% of the pages contained affiliation in-
formation exclusively in a textual form, 24% ex-
clusively in an itemised form and 29% were hy-
brid. Information extraction from these two for-
mats requires different methods. We decided to
address the problem of affiliation extraction just

by using the raw text parts of the homepages.
We partitioned each downloaded page at HTML
breaking tags and kept the parts (paragraphs)
which were regarded as ”raw text”. Here we used
the following rule: a textual paragraph has to be
longer than 40 characters and contain at least one
verb. Certainly this rule is far from perfect (para-
graphs describing publication and longer items of
lists are still present), but it seems to be a reason-
able one as it extracts paragraphs even from ’hy-
brid’ pages. We found 86,735 paragraphs in the
5282 downloaded pages and used them in experi-
ments in a raw txt format (HTML tags were re-
moved).

for the part of this textual corpus which contains
affiliation information (these paragraphs contain
manually labeled information). The corpus is

Our relation extraction system follows the archi-
tecture described in the previous section. We fo-
cus on the relevant part location and information
extraction steps in this study. We applied simple
rules to recognise the relevant parts of the home-
pages. We extract textual paragraphs as described
above and then filter out probably irrelevant ones
(Section 4.3).
Preliminary supervised information extraction
experiments were carried out in our case study in
order to get an insight into the special nature of
the problem. We used a one-researcher-leave-out
evaluation setting (i.e. the train sets consisted of
the paragraphs of 88 researchers and the test sets
concerned 1 researcher), thus we avoided the situ-
ations where a training set contained possibly re-

dundant information about the subject of the test
texts.
A two-stage information extraction system was
applied here. In the first phase, a model should
recognise each possible slot/entities of the target
information tuples (Section 4.4). Then the tuples
have to be filled, i.e. the roles have to be assigned
and irrelevant entities should be ignored (Section
4.5).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998661">
4.3 Paragraph filtering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998925">
Because just a small portion of extracted textual
paragraphs contained affiliation information, we
carried out experiments on filtering out probably
irrelevant paragraphs.
Our filtering method exploited the paragraphs
containing position (positive paragraphs).
We calculated the P(wordlpositive) conditional
probabilities and the best words based on this mea-
sure (e.g. university, institute and professor) then
formed the so-called positive wordset. The para-
graphs which did not contain any word from the
positive wordset were removed. Note that stan-
dard positive and negative sample-based classifi-
cation is not applicable here as the non-positive
paragraphs may contain these indicative words,
but in an irrelevant context or with a connection
to people outside of our scope of interest. Our 1-
DNF hypothesis described above uses just positive
examples and it was inspired by (Yu et al., 2002).
After performing this procedure we kept 14,686
paragraphs (from the full set of 86,735), but we
did not leave out any annotated text. Hence the in-
formation extraction module could then work with
a smaller and less noisy dataset.

4.4 Detecting possible slots
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994042360655738">
We investigated a Named Entity Recognition
(NER) tool for detecting possible actors of a
position tuple. But note that this task is not a
classical NER problem because our goal here is to
recognise just those entities which may play a role
in a position event. For example there were
many year tokens in the text – having the same
orthographic properties – but only a few were re-
lated to affiliation information. The contexts of the
tokens should play an important role in this kind
of an NER targeting of very narrow semantic NE
classes.
For training and evaluating the NER systems,
we used each 151 paragraphs containing at least
one manually labeled position along with 200
other manually selected paragraphs which do not
contain any labeled position. We decided to
use just this 151+200 paragraphs instead of the
full set of 86,735 paragraphs for CPU time rea-
sons. Manual selection – instead of random sam-
pling – was required as there were several para-
graphs which contained affiliation information un-
related to the researcher in question, thus introduc-
ing noise. In our multi-stage architecture, the NER
model trained on this reduced document set was
than predicated for the full set of paragraphs and
false positives (note that the paragraphs outside the
NER-train do not contain any gold-standard anno-
tation) has to be eliminated.
We employed the Condition Random Fields
(Lafferty et al., 2001) (implementation MALLET
(McCallum, 2002)) for our NER experiments.
The feature set employed was developed for gen-
eral NER and includes the following categories
(Szarvas et al., 2006):
orthographical features: capitalisation, word
length, bit information about the word form
(contains a digit or not, has uppercase char-
acter inside the word, and so on), character
level bi/trigrams,
dictionaries of first names, company types, de-
nominators of locations,
frequency information: frequency of the token,
the ratio of the token’s capitalised and low-
ercase occurrences, the ratio of capitalised
and sentence beginning frequencies of the to-
ken which was derived from the Gigaword
dataset5,
contextual information: sentence position, trig-
ger words (the most frequent and unambigu-
ous tokens in a window around the NEs) from
the train text, the word between quotes, and
so on.
This basic set was extended by two domain-
specific gazetteers, namely a list of university
names and position types. We should add that
a domain-specific exception list (containing e.g.
Dr., Ph.D.) for augmenting a general sentence
splitter was employed here.

<bodyText confidence="0.974562375">
When we apply the NER module to unknown doc-
uments we have to decide whether the recognised
entities have any connection with the particular
person as downloaded pages often contain infor-
mation about other researchers (supervisors, stu-
dents, etc.) as well. The subject of the informa-
tion is generally expressed by a proper noun at
the beginning of the page or paragraph and then
anaphoric references are used. We assumed here
that each position tuple in a paragraph was re-
lated to exactly one person and when the subject of
the first sentence of the paragraph was a personal
pronoun I, she, he then the paragraph belonged to
the author of the page.
To automatically find the subject of the para-
graphs we tried out two procedures and evaluated
them on the predictions of the NER model intro-
duced in the previous subsection. First, we applied
a NER trained on the person names of the CoNLL-
2003 corpus (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,
2003). The names predicted by this method were
then compared to the owner of the homepage us-
ing name normalisation techniques. If no name
was found by the tagger we regarded the para-
graph as belonging to the author. Its errors had two
sources; the NER trained on an out-domain corpus
made a lot of false negatives and the normalisation
method had to deal with incorrect ”names” (like
Paul Hunter Curator as a name phrase) as well.
The second method was simpler. We kept
the position tuples whose paragraph contained
any part of the researcher name or any of the ”I”,
”she”, ”he” personal pronouns. Its errors came, for
instance, from finding the ”Paul” string for ”Paul
Robertson” in the text snippet ”Paul Berger”.
We applied these two subject detection meth-
ods to the predictions of our slot detection NER
modul. Table 4 summarises the accuracies of the
systems, i.e. whether they made the correct deci-
sion on ”is this forecasted affiliation corresponds
to the researcher in question”. The columns of
this table shows how many affiliation pre-
diction was carried out by the slot detection sys-
tem, i.e. how many times has to made a de-
cision. ”name. det” and ”p. pronouns” refer
to the two methods, to the name detection-based
and to the personal pronoun-matcher ones. We
investigated their performance on the paragraphs
which contained manually labeled information,
on the paragraphs which did contained any but
the slot detection module forecasted at least one
affiliation here and on the union of these
sets of paragraphs. The figures of the table shows
that the personal pronoun detection approach per-
forms significantly better on the paragraphs which
really contains affiliation information. This is due
to the fact that this method removes less predic-
tion compared to the name based one and there are
just a few forecast which has to be removed on the
paragraphs which contain information.

To find relationships among the other types of
predicated entities (affiliation, position type, start
year, end year) we used a very simple heuristic.
As the affiliation slot is the head of the tuple
we simply assigned every other detected entity to
the nearest affiliation and regarded the ear-
lier preidcated year token as the start year.

This method made the correct decision in the
91.3% and 71.8% of the cases applied on the gold-

spectively. We should add that using the predicted
labels during the evaluation, the false positives of
the NER counts automatically an error in relation

<bodyText confidence="0.999954913978495">
The first step of the information extraction sys-
tem of this case study was the localisation of rele-
vant information. We found that Web search en-
gines are efficient tools for finding homepages.
We empirically showed that a very simple crawl-
ing (downloading everything to a depth of 1) can
be applied, because the irrelevant contents can be
removed later. The advantage of focused crawl-
ing (i.e. making a decision before download-
ing a linked page) is that it can avoid the time-
consuming analysis of pages. However making
the decision of whether the linked document might
contain relevant information is a hard task. On the
other hand we showed that the requested informa-
tion is reachable in depth 1 and that a fast string-
matching based filtering method can significantly
reduce the amount of texts which have to be anal-
ysed without losing any information. Moreover,
the positive example-based filtering approach can
be employed in a seed-driven setting as well.
For the information extraction phase we think
that a high-recall system has to be developed. We
constructed a corpus with contextual occurrences
for evaluation issues. The extraction can be re-
lationship detection-based (e.g. the state-of-the-
art seed-driven approaches seek to acquire syntac-
tic/semantic patterns which are typical of the re-
lationship itself) or entity-based (like our method,
these approaches first identify possible actors then
look for relationships among them). We expect
that the latter one is more suitable for high-recall
tasks.
The NER system of this case study achieved
significantly better results than those for the base-
line method. We experimentally showed that
it could exploit the contextual information and
that the labeled entities were those which were
affiliation-related. However, the overall system
has to be improved in the future. We manually
analysed the errors on a part of the corpus and
found a few typical errors were present. Our
annotation guide said that the geographical loca-
tion of the affiliation was a part of the affilia-
tion as it sometimes identifies the department (e.g.
”Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto”). This ex-
tension of the phrase proved to be difficult because
there were several cases with the same ortho-
graphic features (e.g. Ph.D. from MIT in Physics).
The acronyms immediately after the affiliation are
a similar case, which we regard as part of the name
and it is difficult for the NER to handle (e.g. Cen-
tre for Policy Modelling (CPM)). As there is no
partial credit; an incorrect entity boundary is pe-
nalised both as a false positive and as a false neg-
ative.
These points also explain the surprisingly low
precision of the baseline system as it labeled uni-
versity names without more detailed identifica-
tion of the unit (e.g. Department of Computer
Science, [Waterloo University]BASELINE). We
should add that these two annotation guidelines
are questionable, but we expect that information
might get lost without them. Moreover, there is
an another reason for the low recall, it is that our
human annotators found textual clues for position
types on verbs as well (e.g. I leadTY PE the Dis-
tributed Systems Group). The context of these la-
beled examples are clearly different from that of
the usual position type.
Comparing the two subject detection methods,
we see that the name detection model which learnt
on an out-domain corpus made a lot of mistakes,
thus the method based on it judged more para-
graphs as irrelevant ones. The name detection
could be improved by a domain corpus (for exam-
ple the training corpus did not contain any Prof.
NAME example) and by applying more sophisti-
cated name normalisation techniques. When we
manually analysed the errors of these procedures
we found that each false negative of the sim-
pler subject detection method was due to the er-
rors of the textual paragraph identification defini-
tion used. There were several itemisations whose
header was type of ”Previously I worked for:” and
the textual items themselves did not contain the
subject of the affiliation information. The false
positives often originated from pages which did
not belong to the researcher in question but con-
tained him name (e.g. I am a Ph.D. Student work-
ing under the supervision of Prof. NAME).
Lastly, an error analysis of the affiliation head
seeking heuristic revealed that the 44% of the
predicted position type and year entities’s
</bodyText>

sentences did not contain any affiliation
prediction. With the gold-standard labeling, there
were 6 sentences without affiliation labels
and only one of them used an anaphoric refer-
ence, the others were a consequence of the erro-
neous automatic sentence splitting of the HTML
documents. The prediction of the NER sys-
tem contained many more sentences without any
affiliation label. These could be fixed
by forcing a second forecast phase to predict
affiliation in these sentences or by remov-
ing these labels in a post-processing step.
The remaining errors of the affiliation head as-
signment could be avoided just by employing a
proper syntactic analyser. The most important lin-
guistic phenomena which should be automatically
identify for this problem is enumeration. For in-
stance, we should distinguish between the enumer-
ation and clause splitting roles of ’and’ (e.g. ”I’m
a senior researcher and leader of the GROUP”
and ”He got his PhD from UNIVERSITY1 in YEAR
and has a Masters from UNIVERSITY2”). This
requires a deep syntactic analysis, i.e. the use of
a dependency parser which has to make accurate
predictions on several certain types of dependen-
cies is probably needed.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999734761904762">
In this paper we introduced a Web Content Mining
system for gathering affiliation information from
the homepages of researchers. The affiliation in-
formation collected from this source might be of
great value for scientific social network analysis.
We discussed the special nature of this task
compared to common Web-based relation extrac-
tion approaches and identified several subtasks of
the system during our preliminary experiments.
We argued that the evaluation of this kind of sys-
tem should be carried out on a manually labeled
reference corpus. We introduced simple but ef-
fective solutions for the subproblems along with
empirical results on a corpus. We achieved rea-
sonable results with an overall phrase-level F�_i
score of 70% on the possible slot detection and
an accuracy of 61% on relation extraction (as an
aggregation of the subject detection and the affil-
iation head selection procedures). However each
subproblem requires more sophisticated solutions,
which we plan to address in the near future.

However in the future we plan to develop a two-stage approach to solve them. In the first stage a general homepage detection model – a binary classification problem with classes homepage/non-homepage – will be applied. In the second stage we will attempt to automatically extract textual clues for the relations among the researchers (e.g. the particular field they work in) from the homepage candidates and utilise these cues for name disambiguation along with other biographical cues. For a survey of state-of-the-art name disambiguation, see (Artiles et al., 2009). 3.2 Locating the relevant parts of the site The URL got from the search engine usually points to the main page of the homepage site. An ideal system should automatically find every page which might contain scientific social information like Curriculum Vitae, Research interests, Projects etc. This can be done by analysing the text of the links or even the linked page. In our case study we simply parsed the pages to a depth of 1 (i.e. the main page and each page which was linked from it). The located web pages usually have their content arranged in sections.

Information extraction is performed from the structured parts of the documents by automatically constructed rules based on the HTML tags and keywords. This field is called Wrapper Induction (Kushmerick, 2000). We shall focus on the information extraction from raw texts here because we found that more pages express content in textual form than in a structured one in the researchers’ homepages of our case study and this task still has several unsolved problems. We mentioned above that scientific social information extraction has to capture each occurrence of the target information. We manually labeled homepages for the evaluation of these systems. We think that the DOM structure of the homepages (e.g. formatting tags, section headers) could provide useful information, hence the labeling was carried </context>

We will introduce our system which seeks [affiliation, position, start year, end year] information tuples on these homepages along with preliminary experimental results. We believe that the lessons learnt from these experiments may be useful for further scientific social web mining. 1 Introduction Scientific social network analysis (Yang et al., 2009; Said et al., 2008) seeks to discover global patterns in the network of researchers working in a particular field. Common approaches uses bibliographic/scholarly data as the basis for this analysis. In this paper, we will discuss the potential of exploiting other resources as an information source, such as the homepages of researchers. The homepage of a researcher contains several useful pieces of scientific social information like the name of their supervisor, affiliations, academic ranking and so on. The information on homepages may be present in a structured or natural text form. Here we shall focus on the de</context>

We will introduce our system which seeks [affiliation, position, start year, end year] information tuples on these homepages along with preliminary experimental results. We believe that the lessons learnt from these experiments may be useful for further scientific social web mining. 1 Introduction Scientific social network analysis (Yang et al., 2009; Said et al., 2008) seeks to discover global patterns in the network of researchers working in a particular field. Common approaches uses bibliographic/scholarly data as the basis for this analysis. In this paper, we will discuss the potential of exploiting other resources as an information source, such as the homepages of researchers. The homepage of a researcher contains several useful pieces of scientific social information like the name of their supervisor, affiliations, academic ranking and so on. The information on homepages may be present in a structured or natural text form. Here we s</context>

The architecture of the complex system and the recognised problems will be discussed in Section 3, while our empirical results will be presented in Section 4. In the last two sections we will briefly discuss our results and then draw our main conclusions. 2 Related work The relationship to previous studies will be discussed from a scientific social network analysis as an application point of view and from a Web Content Mining point of view as well. 2.1 Researcher affiliation extraction Scientific social network analysis has become a growing area in recent years ((Yang et al., 2009; Robardet and Fleury, 2009; Said et al., 2008) just to name a few in recent studies). Its goal is to provide a deeper insight into a research field or into the personal connections among fields by analysing relationships among researchers. The existing studies use the co-authorship (e.g. (Newman, 2001; Barab´asi et al., 2002)) or/and the citation (Goodrum et al., 2001; Teufel et al., 2006) information – generally by constructing a graph with nodes representing researchers – as the basis for their investigations. Apart from publication-related relationships – which are presented in structured </context>

The paragraphs which did not contain any word from the positive wordset were removed. Note that standard positive and negative sample-based classification is not applicable here as the non-positive paragraphs may contain these indicative words, but in an irrelevant context or with a connection to people outside of our scope of interest. Our 1- DNF hypothesis described above uses just positive examples and it was inspired by (Yu et al., 2002). After performing this procedure we kept 14,686 paragraphs (from the full set of 86,735), but we did not leave out any annotated text. Hence the information extraction module could then work with a smaller and less noisy dataset. 4.4 Detecting possible slots We investigated a Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool for detecting possible actors of a position tuple. But note that this task is not a classical NER problem because our goal here is to recognise just those entities which may play a role in a position event. For example there were many year tokens in the text – having the same orthograp</context>
