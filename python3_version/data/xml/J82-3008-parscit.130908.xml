This paper describes recent research on a natural-
language-generation system that is based on planning.
A system named KAMP is described that is capable of
producing English sentences as part of a plan to enlist
the cooperation of another agent in achieving a goal
involving a change in the physical state of the world.
The planner uses knowledge about the different sub-
goals to be achieved and linguistic rules about English
to produce sentences that satisfy multiple goals
through the realization of multiple illocutionary acts.

Understanding an utterance in an argument crucial-
ly requires determining the evidential relations it bears
to prior and subsequent propositions in the argument.
The memory representation of an argument should,
accordingly, indicate which propositions a given prop-
osition counts as evidence for (a support relation) or
against (an attack relation), and which propositions
support or attack it in turn. The representation of an
argument can thus be viewed as a network of proposi-
tions connected by support or attack relations (an
argument graph). Although this sort of representation
can be motivated simply by the need to represent the
content of an argument, it seems natural to ask wheth-
er such argument graphs might further possess any
useful structural properties, abstracted from the specif-
ic propositions they relate.

This paper describes a question answering program

processes: answer formation and answer expression.
Rather than gathering possible answers and choosing
the best among them, the program accesses the data-
base and finds all components of possible answers, e.g.
a causal chain, and then passes this information to an
expression program which formulates a proper answer.

essed by the UMass VISIONS system. The texts fol-

by their visual salience — an ordering which we be-

processing, and thus is available — for free — as the
basis for generating simple but effective texts without
requiring the complex planning machinery often ap-
plied in generation. We suggest that it should be pos-

other domains and to build comparably simple genera-

one such analogy might be drawn for the task of tutor-

&amp;quot;Event shape diagrams&amp;quot; are proposed as a repre-

represent timing, causal relationships between case

shape diagrams are expressed in terms of primitive

intended to be a step toward the eventual connection
of language systems to perceptual (vision, hearing, and

The parsing of natural language is the product of
dense interactions among various comprehension proc-
esses. We believe that traditional models have greatly
underestimated the richness of these interactions. We
propose a model for low-level parsing which is mas-
sively parallel, highly distributed, and highly connect-
ed. The model suggests a solution to the problem of
word sense disambiguation which is psychologically
plausible and computationally feasible. The paper
outlines the general connectionist paradigm followed
by a brief description of a three-level network to do

strange syntax; redundancy elimination; lack of the-

This paper outlines an approach to schema acquisi-
tion. The approach, called explanatory schema acquisi-
tion is applicable in problem solving situations and is
heavily knowledge-based. Basically, learning is viewed
as a fundamental part of the understanding process.
Understanding a situation for which there is no exist-
ing schema involves generalizing the new event into a
nascent schema. The new schema is then available to
aid in future processing. This approach to learning is
unique in several respects: it is not inductive and so is
capable of one trial learning, it does not depend on
failures to drive the learning process, and it is incre-
mental and learns comparatively slowly. The learning
procedure is outlined briefly with an example, a taxon-
omy of situations involving explanatory schema acqui-

Newspaper cartoons can graphically display the
results of ambiguity in human speech. The result can
be unexpected and funny. Captioned cartoons derive
their humor from a sudden incongruity which • can be
made to follow by a human being who can automati-
cally use stored world knowledge to resolve the ambi-
guous situation. Likewise, computer analysis of natu-
ral language statements also needs to successfully re-
solve ambiguous situations. Computerized under-
standing of dialogue that takes place between humans
must not only include syntactical and semantical anal-
ysis, but also pragmatical analysis. Pragmatics consists
of an understanding of the speaker&apos;s intentions, the
context of the utterance, and social implications of
polite human communication.
Computer techniques have already been developed
to use restricted world knowledge in resolving ambigu-
ous language use. This paper illustrates how these
techniques can be used in resolving ambiguous situa-
tions arising in cartoons.

Identifying factors that influence pronoun reference
assignment is a challenge to anyone attempting to
characterize the process of language understanding.
Because a pronoun itself carries only a small part of
the meaning that the understander is expected to as-
sign to it, he or she must use contextual information to
assign the pronoun an unambiguous referent. Charac-
terizing aspects of the context which are used for this
purpose is an active area of psychological research.
Many recent studies have considered the role of
syntactic context, that is, the effect of structural
constraints on pronoun reference in a fragment of text,
typically a sentence, without recourse to constraints
which might be found in the meaning of the text. In-
vestigators have also examined the role of semantic
factors within sentences in directing the assignment of
referents. The studies reported here focus on the use
of pragmatic constraints in resolving anaphoric pro-
nouns. We are concerned with characterizing two
major sources of contextual information in paragraph-
length texts, and evaluating their influence on prono-
minal reference assignment.

Inference can be viewed as a search through a space
of inference rules. Backward and forward inference
differ in the direction of the search: backward infer-
ence searches from goals to ground assertions; forward
inference searches from ground assertions to goals.
This paper describes an inference procedure, called
bi-directional inference, which limits the number of
inference rules searched. Bi-directional inference re-
sults from the interaction between forward and back-
ward inference and loosely corresponds to bi-
directional search. We show through an example that,
when used throughout a session of related tasks, bi-
directional inference sets up a conversational context
and prunes the search through the space of inference
rules by ignoring rules which are not relevant to that
context.

Step-by-step natural language specification provides
powerful intuitions for novice programmers using a
programming language. We hypothesize that these
intuitions take the form of frame-like plans — regular
but flexible techniques for specifying how to accom-
plish a task. Programming knowledge also involves
frame-like plans. While an individual programming
language plan may have many lexical and syntactic
similarities to a corresponding natural language plan,
the two plans often have incompatible semantics and
pragmatics. Many novice programmers&apos; misconcep-
tions derive directly from these incompatibilities. In
this brief report we show an example of natural lan-
guage and programming language plans. Using those
plans we discuss transcripts of novice programmers
using a natural language plan while attempting a pro-
gramming language problem. We conclude with a
brief discussion of the implications of this work.

I have developed a question-answering program that
will answer questions about simple stories. In my
program, question-answering is divided into two proc-
esses: (1) answer formation and (2) answer expres-
sion. The program first looks down a causal chain
which is formed by the story-understanding program
and figures out in what part of the chain the answer
lies. The answer can also be a subset of the chain,
sometimes a quite long one. The second part of the
program takes this long chain and decides what things
are important to express to the questioner. This an-
swer expresser uses general rules of expression to fig-
ure out what it needs to include to make the answer
understandable, informative and interesting.
This solution is different from other question-
answering algorithms which view question answering
as one process. These programs gather possible an-
swers, and then choose the &apos;best&apos; answer from among
them. My program works in conjunction with PAME-
LA, a story-understanding program that specializes in
goal-based stories.

In this short paper, we suggest a framework for the
study of schematic aspects of natural language com-
prehension. The approach draws from previous work
in schematic representation and reasoning, spreading
activation, parsing, speech recognition, psycholinguis-
tics, and computer vision. By decomposing schematic
knowledge into diffuse units and by studying the way
these facets of knowledge are connected inferentially,
we expect to show important results in several areas.
We use a particular spreading activation or active se-
mantic network scheme, called connection ism, which
consists of a massive number of appropriately connect-
ed computing units that communicate through weight-
ed levels of excitation and inhibition. We show how a
number of classical problems in the theory of schema-
ta might be approached in a new way. Three principal
issues are discussed: (1) comprehension takes place
on a number of interacting levels of processing; (2)
multiple hypotheses are simultaneously maintained at a
number of diffuse processing loci; and (3) context
affects processing in both top-down and bottom-up
directions.

This paper describes the language understanding
component of the Unix Consultant (UC) system being
developed at the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Re-
search project. The purpose of UC is to hold a con-
versation with a naive user of the Unix operating sys-
tem while he or she is working on the computer, an-
swering questions and solving problems for the user.
The system has several other components, including
the common sense planner PANDORA and the plan
understander PAMELA. Our natural language under-
standing system contains as a subpart the PHRAN
phrasal analysis program. The current system attempts
to deal with the fact that PHRAN by itself is unable
to deal with reference, and cannot disambiguate unless
the linguistic patterns used require a particular seman-
tic interpretation of the words. In addition, we wish
to account for the fact that the same utterance may be
interpreted differently in different contexts.

In the course of understanding a text, a succession
of decision points arise at which readers are faced with
the task of choosing among alternative possible inter-
pretations of what they&apos;re reading. Careful analysis of
a wide range of sample texts reveals that such deci-
sions are often based on complex evaluations of the
interpretation being constructed, and sometimes cause
the reader to construct and discard a number of inter-
mediate inferences before settling on a final interpre-
tation for a text. This paper describes Judgmental
Inference theory as a proposed scheme of evaluation
metrics and mechanisms, derived from examination of
inference decisions arising during text understanding.
A series of programs, ARTHUR, MACARTHUR, and
JUDGE are briefly described, which incorporate some
of the metrics and mechanisms of Judgmental Infer-
ence, enabling them to understand texts more complex
than those that can be handled by other understanding
systems.

the knowledge of the regularities of text construction.

phases: the comprehension phase receives the French
recipe text and outputs a sequence of elementary ac-

several texts all expressing, in Arabic, the same origi-

from the question meaning representation produced by

in three steps, and the paper suggests that the rich and

This paper presents an approach to a computer
analysis of simple metaphorical statements which pro-
vides a framework in which factors salient to the met-
aphor as well as conceptual information essential to
the interpretation can be consistently incorporated.
This approach considers both &amp;quot;what is happening,&amp;quot; i.e.
predicative or explicit information, and the impression
which the speaker/writer wishes to create, as repre-
sented by modifying or implicit information.
The predicative aspect provided the basis of a pre-
viously implemented system, which was based on ab-
stracted attributes and relations, but also allowed for
evaluative and magnitudinal factors; this system para-
phrased statements including metaphorically used
verbs. The proposed expanded system allows for the
incorporation of effects or impressions on the partici-
pants of the metaphorically expressed conceptualiza-
tion, on &amp;quot;outside observers&amp;quot; and, indirectly, on the
hearer/reader. The concept of force, which is seen as
frequently structuring motivations for and conditions
on changes of state, constitutes one of the factors
shown to be useful in the analysis of such effects.

Although a great deal of research effort has been
expended in support of natural language (NL) data-
base querying, little effort has gone into NL database
update. One reason for this is that in NL querying one
can tie nouns and stative verbs in the query to data-
base objects (relation names, attributes and domain
values). In many cases this correspondence seems
sufficient to interpret NL queries. NL update seems
to require database counterparts for active verbs, such
as hire, schedule and enroll. We suggest a database
counterpart for active verbs, which we call verbgraphs,
that may be used to support NL update. A verbgraph
is a structure for representing the various database
changes that a given verb might describe. Other possi-
ble uses of verbgraphs include specification of de-
faults, prompting of the user to guide user interaction,
and enforcing database integrity constraints.

We then give &amp;quot;conceptual&amp;quot; MG translations for the words in an example sentence which we use in approximating a word-based parsing style. Finally, we make some suggestions regarding further extensions of logic to introduce higher level representations.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.959303">Proc. 1982 AAA/ Conf., Aug. 1982, 84-87. &amp;quot;Event shape diagrams&amp;quot; are proposed as a representation for capturing the nuances of meaning of verbs that describe similar events. These diagrams represent timing, causal relationships between case roles, and typical value ranges for role fillers. Event shape diagrams are expressed in terms of primitive predicates and timing information that we believe could be computed by perceptual systems, and are intended to be a step toward the eventual connection of language systems to perceptual (vision, hearing, and touch) sensing systems. The diagrams are capable of representing modification of verbs by adverbs, can support judgments of the degree of plausibility of various interpretations of a sentence&apos;s meaning, and may be useful in figuring out the meaning of certain kinds of metaphors.</abstract>

The model suggests a solution to the problem of word sense disambiguation which is psychologically plausible and computationally feasible.

Basically, learning is viewed as a fundamental part of the understanding process. Understanding a situation for which there is no existing schema involves generalizing the new event into a nascent schema. The new schema is then available to aid in future processing. This approach to learning is unique in several respects: it is not inductive and so is capable of one trial learning, it does not depend on failures to drive the learning process, and it is incremental and learns comparatively slowly. The learning procedure is outlined briefly with an example, a taxonomy of situations involving explanatory schema acquisition is given, and there is a brief discussion on the scope of the learning mechanism.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.969548">Proc. 4th Ann. Conf. Cog. Sci. Soc., Aug. 1982, 62-66. Newspaper cartoons can graphically display the results of ambiguity in human speech. The result can be unexpected and funny. Captioned cartoons derive their humor from a sudden incongruity which • can be made to follow by a human being who can automatically use stored world knowledge to resolve the ambiguous situation. Likewise, computer analysis of natural language statements also needs to successfully resolve ambiguous situations. Computerized understanding of dialogue that takes place between humans must not only include syntactical and semantical analysis, but also pragmatical analysis. Pragmatics consists of an understanding of the speaker&apos;s intentions, the context of the utterance, and social implications of polite human communication. Computer techniques have already been developed to use restricted world knowledge in resolving ambiguous language use. This paper illustrates how these techniques can be used in resolving ambiguous situations arising in cartoons.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.956400391304348">Proc. 4th Ann. Conf. Cog. Sci. Soc., Aug. 1982, 70-72. Identifying factors that influence pronoun reference assignment is a challenge to anyone attempting to characterize the process of language understanding. Because a pronoun itself carries only a small part of the meaning that the understander is expected to assign to it, he or she must use contextual information to assign the pronoun an unambiguous referent. Characterizing aspects of the context which are used for this purpose is an active area of psychological research. Many recent studies have considered the role of syntactic context, that is, the effect of structural constraints on pronoun reference in a fragment of text, typically a sentence, without recourse to constraints which might be found in the meaning of the text. Investigators have also examined the role of semantic factors within sentences in directing the assignment of referents. The studies reported here focus on the use of pragmatic constraints in resolving anaphoric pronouns. We are concerned with characterizing two major sources of contextual information in paragraphlength texts, and evaluating their influence on pronominal reference assignment.</abstract>

Backward and forward inference differ in the direction of the search: backward inference searches from goals to ground assertions; forward inference searches from ground assertions to goals. This paper describes an inference procedure, called bi-directional inference, which limits the number of inference rules searched. Bi-directional inference results from the interaction between forward and backward inference and loosely corresponds to bidirectional search. We show through an example that, when used throughout a session of related tasks, bidirectional inference sets up a conversational context and prunes the search through the space of inference rules by ignoring rules which are not relevant to that context.</abstract>

Step-by-step natural language specification provides powerful intuitions for novice programmers using a programming language. We hypothesize that these take the form of frame-like — but flexible techniques for specifying how to accomplish a task. Programming knowledge also involves frame-like plans. While an individual programming language plan may have many lexical and syntactic similarities to a corresponding natural language plan, the two plans often have incompatible semantics and pragmatics. Many novice programmers&apos; misconceptions derive directly from these incompatibilities. In this brief report we show an example of natural language and programming language plans. Using those plans we discuss transcripts of novice programmers using a natural language plan while attempting a programming language problem. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of this work.</abstract>

In my program, question-answering is divided into two processes: (1) answer formation and (2) answer expression. The program first looks down a causal chain which is formed by the story-understanding program and figures out in what part of the chain the answer lies. The answer can also be a subset of the chain, sometimes a quite long one. The second part of the program takes this long chain and decides what things are important to express to the questioner. This answer expresser uses general rules of expression to figure out what it needs to include to make the answer understandable, informative and interesting. This solution is different from other questionanswering algorithms which view question answering as one process. These programs gather possible answers, and then choose the &apos;best&apos; answer from among them. My program works in conjunction with PAME- LA, a story-understanding program that specializes in goal-based stories.</abstract>

In this short paper, we suggest a framework for the study of schematic aspects of natural language comprehension. The approach draws from previous work in schematic representation and reasoning, spreading activation, parsing, speech recognition, psycholinguistics, and computer vision. By decomposing schematic knowledge into diffuse units and by studying the way these facets of knowledge are connected inferentially, we expect to show important results in several areas. We use a particular spreading activation or active senetwork scheme, called ism, consists of a massive number of appropriately connected computing units that communicate through weighted levels of excitation and inhibition. We show how a number of classical problems in the theory of schemata might be approached in a new way. Three principal issues are discussed: (1) comprehension takes place on a number of interacting levels of processing; (2) multiple hypotheses are simultaneously maintained at a number of diffuse processing loci; and (3) context affects processing in both top-down and bottom-up directions.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.9899558">Proc. 4th Ann. Conf. Cog. Sc!. Soc., Aug. 1982, 177-180. In the course of understanding a text, a succession of decision points arise at which readers are faced with the task of choosing among alternative possible interpretations of what they&apos;re reading. Careful analysis of a wide range of sample texts reveals that such decisions are often based on complex evaluations of the interpretation being constructed, and sometimes cause the reader to construct and discard a number of intermediate inferences before settling on a final interpretation for a text. This paper describes Judgmental Inference theory as a proposed scheme of evaluation metrics and mechanisms, derived from examination of inference decisions arising during text understanding. series of programs, ARTHUR, and JUDGE are briefly described, which incorporate some of the metrics and mechanisms of Judgmental Inference, enabling them to understand texts more complex than those that can be handled by other understanding systems.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.9803374375">Proc. 1982 European Al Conf., July 1982, 125-126. The process of discourse comprehension presupposes close co-operation of two subsystems of an understanding system — its knowledge (memory) subsystem reasoning subsystem. The authors present a concrete mechanism called SCENE SURVEYOR for guidreasoning in a text understanding system TAR- LUS. The SCENE SURVEYOR is an active structure which makes use of the knowledge of the world and the knowledge of the regularities of text construction. Its active character is manifested in posing questions about incoming data and looking for answers to these questions in order to recognize higher level situations (events not mentioned in the text explicitly), and secondly, in keeping track of scenes and their changes in the text.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.9596746">Proc. 1982 European Al Conf., July 1982, 222-227. This paper shows how user modelling can improve the anaphoric utterances generated by a dialogue system. Two kinds of anaphora are examined: contextual ellipsis and the anaphoric use of singular definite Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature noun phrases. In connection with ellipsis generation, anticipation of the way in which the user would be likely to reconstruct a given utterance can help to ensure that the system&apos;s utterances are not so brief as to be ambiguous or misleading. When generating noun phrases to characterize specific objects with which the user is not familiar, the system may take into account the existential assumptions, domain-related desires, and reference beliefs ascribed to the partner. These applications of user modelling are illustrated as realized in the dialogue system HAM-ANS, and some possible generalizations and extensions of the strategies described are discussed.</abstract>

This paper outlines a program that translates in the restricted context of cooking recipes from French into Arabic. It consists of two completely independent phases: the comprehension phase receives the French recipe text and outputs a sequence of elementary actions; the second phase generates from that sequence several texts all expressing, in Arabic, the same original recipe. Thus the translation is actually done text for text. The two phases are not fully developed here; but we describe a general scheme of the program and point out the analogy between them.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.956378875">Proc. 1982 European Al Conf., July 1982, 232-233. The aim of the work reported here is to maximize the use of general semantic information in an Al task processor, specifically in a system front end for converting natural language questions into formal database queries. The paper describes the translation component of such a front end, which is designed to work from the question meaning representation produced by a language analyser exploiting only general semantics and syntax, to a formal query relying on databasespecific semantics and syntax. Translation is effected in three steps, and the paper suggests that the rich and explicit meaning representations using semantic primitives produced for input sentences by the analyser constitute a natural and effective base for further processing.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.984985043478261">Proc. 1982 European Al Conf., July 1982, 234-239. This paper presents an approach to a computer analysis of simple metaphorical statements which provides a framework in which factors salient to the metaphor as well as conceptual information essential to the interpretation can be consistently incorporated. This approach considers both &amp;quot;what is happening,&amp;quot; i.e. predicative or explicit information, and the impression which the speaker/writer wishes to create, as represented by modifying or implicit information. The predicative aspect provided the basis of a previously implemented system, which was based on abstracted attributes and relations, but also allowed for evaluative and magnitudinal factors; this system paraphrased statements including metaphorically used verbs. The proposed expanded system allows for the incorporation of effects or impressions on the participants of the metaphorically expressed conceptualization, on &amp;quot;outside observers&amp;quot; and, indirectly, on the hearer/reader. The concept of force, which is seen as frequently structuring motivations for and conditions on changes of state, constitutes one of the factors shown to be useful in the analysis of such effects.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.975679083333334">Proc. 1982 European Al Conf., July 1982, 240-243. Information systems with natural language access to stored data range from rather simple systems for specific purposes up to experimental projects of natural language understanding systems compiling also the data in an automatic way. Many of these projects use a trial-and-error approach; to make such a system more general, it seems advisable to include a relatively complete analysis of language structure; this ensures a general base, which can be simplified with respect to particular applications. Using operational tests for distinguishing between meaning and factual knowledge, ambiguity and indistinctness, etc., the Prague Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 3-4, July-December 1982 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature research group has formulated the level of meaning as a set of underlying representations consisting in dependency trees with nodes labelled by complex symbols, every lexical unit having its valency (case) frame. The relationships between this level of meaning and the domain of cognitive structures is handled by means of inference rules. The system described is being prepared for experiments in question-answering, based only on input texts and inference rules.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.952726166666667">Proc. 1982 European Al Conf., July 1982, 244-249. Although a great deal of research effort has been expended in support of natural language (NL) database querying, little effort has gone into NL database reason for this is that in NL querying one can tie nouns and stative verbs in the query to database objects (relation names, attributes and domain values). In many cases this correspondence seems sufficient to interpret NL queries. NL update seems to require database counterparts for active verbs, such schedule suggest a database counterpart for active verbs, which we call verbgraphs, that may be used to support NL update. A verbgraph is a structure for representing the various database changes that a given verb might describe. Other possible uses of verbgraphs include specification of defaults, prompting of the user to guide user interaction, and enforcing database integrity constraints.</abstract>

Within a unique formalism, logic is a powerful theoretical basis allowing one to represent a database and to express the different types of processing — syntactic, semantic and deductive — involved when this is consulted in natural language. this framework we describe a complete system using a three-truth valued logic, rigorously defined. This logic allows a very fine representation of question semantics and lays the theoretical basis for the creation of an informative system consulted by casual or non-expert users. We compare the performance of our system with that of related ones, and outline possible extensions.</abstract>

We describe GLP, a chart parser that will be used as a SYNTAX module of the Erlangen Speech Understanding System. After a brief outline of the speech system&apos;s architecture we introduce the concept of chart parsing. The parser itself realizes a multiprocessing structure using an agenda, which easily allows the application of various parsing strategies in a transparent way. Finally we discuss which features have to be incorporated into the parser in order to process speech data: direction independent island parsing, handling of scores, and the interaction with higher level components like SEMANTICS.</abstract>
