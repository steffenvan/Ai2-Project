We examine the typology of quantity-
insensitive (QI) stress systems and ask to what
extent an existing optimality theoretic model
of QI stress can predict the observed typolog-
ical frequencies of stress patterns. We find
three significant correlates of pattern attesta-
tion and frequency: the trigram entropy of a
pattern, the degree to which it is “confusable”
with other patterns predicted by the model,
and the number of constraint rankings that
specify the pattern.

A remarkable characteristic of human language is
that the typological distribution of many linguis-
tic properties is extremely uneven. For example,
Maddieson’s (1984) survey of phonemic inventories
finds that a total of 921 distinct sounds are used by
a sample of 451 languages, yet the average language
employs only about 30 of those. Furthermore, some
sounds are so commonly attested as to be almost uni-
versal (e.g., /m/, /k/), while others are vanishingly
rare (/x/, /œ/). Heinz (2007) combines two pre-
vious typologies of accentual stress (Bailey, 1995;
Gordon, 2002), and finds that among a sample of
306 languages with quantity-insensitive (QI) stress
systems, 26 distinct stress patterns are found,1 while
over 60% of the languages surveyed use one of just 3
of these patterns. If we begin to look at morphosyn-
tactic or semantic properties, the combinatorics of

possible systems veritably explodes, leaving each at-
tested language with an even smaller slice of the log-
ical possibilities.
Most typological studies have attempted to give
accounts of linguistic phenomena that simultane-
ously:

as possible, and

<bodyText confidence="0.999956041666667">
We will refer to this goal as the “inclusion-
exclusion” criterion of a linguistic model. Com-
paratively few attempts have been made to explain
or predict the relative frequencies with which lan-
guages or patterns are observed to occur in cross-
linguistic samples (though see Liljencrants and
Lindblom 1972, de Boer 2000, Moreton to appear,
and others for work proceeding in this direction).
This paper examines the typology of QI stress
systems, as reported by Heinz (2007), and asks to
what extent an existing optimality theoretic (Prince
and Smolensky, 1993) model of QI stress, developed
by Gordon (2002) to meet the inclusion-exclusion
criterion, can predict the observed typological fre-
quencies of stress patterns. Gordon’s model pre-
dicts a total of 152 possible stress patterns, which,
as far as we are aware, represent the current best at-
tempt at satisfying the inclusion-exclusion criterion
for QI stress, failing to generate only two attested
stress patterns (unknown to Gordon at the time), and
generating 128 unattested patterns. We show that
Gordon’s model can offer at least three novel, sta-
tistically significant predictors of which of the 152
generated patterns are actually attested, and of the

cross-linguistic frequencies of the attested patterns.
Namely:
i. Of the 152 stress patterns predicted by Gor-
don’s model, the attested and frequent ones ex-
hibit significantly lower trigram entropy than
the unattested and infrequent,
ii. the length of forms, in syllables, that must be
observed to uniquely identify a stress pattern is
significantly lower for the attested patterns than
for the unattested, and
iii. the number of constraint rankings in Gordon’s
model that are consistent with a stress pattern
is a significant predictor both of which patterns
are attested and of the relative frequencies of
the attested patterns.
In what follows, Section 2 presents an overview of
the basic theoretical background and empirical facts
of quantity-insensitive stress that guide this study,
including a review of Heinz’s (2007) typology and a
description of Gordon’s (2002) OT model. Section 3
then introduces the three proposed correlates of at-
testedness and frequency that can be applied to Gor-
don’s framework, together with statistical analyses
of their significance as predictors. Finally, Section 4
offers a discussion of the interpretation of these find-
ings, as well as some concluding remarks.

We will follow Gordon (2002) and Heinz (2007) in
taking a stress system to be any accentual system
that satisfies “culminativity” in the sense of Prince
(1983); that is, any accentual system in which there
is always one most prominent accentual unit per ac-
centual domain. In this case, we assume that the
accentual unit is the syllable, and that the domain
is the prosodic word. Thus, any given syllable of a
word may bear primary, secondary, or no stress (we
ignore the possibility of tertiary or other stress), but
there must always be exactly one primary stressed
syllable per word.
We further restrict our attention in this study to
quantity-insensitive (QI) stress systems, which are
those stress systems according to which the assign-
ment of stresses to a word’s syllables depends only

on the number of syllables present (a quantity as-
sumed to be fixed when stress is assigned), and not
on the segmental contents of the syllables. We will
refer to “stress systems” and “stress patterns” inter-
changeably.
As two concrete examples of QI stress systems,
consider those of Albanian (Chafe, 1977; also
shared by many other languages) and Malakmalak
(an Australian language; Birk, 1976). These pat-
terns are illustrated in Table 1 for words of length
two through six syllables.2 The former is a simple
fixed system in which primary stress is always lo-
cated on the penultimate syllable, while no other syl-
lable bears stress. The latter is rather more complex,
requiring stress on even numbered syllables from the
right, the leftmost being primary. Crucially, neither
system is sensitive to notions like syllabic weight,
nor to any other properties of the syllables’ contents.
Formally, one can consider a QI stress pattern up
to length n (in syllables), Pn, to be a set of strings
over the alphabet E = {Q, Q, Q}:

frequency (Figure 2).
The top three most common patterns, together ac-
counting for over 60% of the sampled languages, are
all simple fixed primary stress systems: fixed final
stress (24.2% of systems), fixed initial stress (22.5%
of systems), and fixed penultimate stress (19.6% of
systems). It is possible that fixed primary systems
may be somewhat overrepresented, as the descrip-
tive sources can be expected to occasionally fail to
report the presence of secondary stress; even so, the
preponderance of such systems would seem to be
substantial. The great majority of distinctly attested
systems are quite rare, the median frequency being
0.65% of sampled languages. Some examples of
cross-linguistically unlikely patterns include that of
Georgian, with antepenultimate primary stress and
initial secondary stress, and that of Ic¸u˜a Tupi, which
shows penultimate primary stress in words of four or
fewer syllables, but antepenultimate stress in longer
words.
There is some reason to believe that this sample is
fairly representative of the whole population of QI
stress patterns used by the world’s languages. While
it is true that the majority of sampled patterns are
rare, it is by no means the case that the majority
of sampled languages exhibit rare stress patterns.
In fact, of the N = 306 sampled languages, just
n1 = 13 of them present stress patterns that are
attested only once. Thus, according to the com-
monly used Good-Turing estimate (a distribution-
free method of estimating type frequencies in a pop-
ulation from a sample of tokens; Good, 1953), we
should expect to reserve approximately N = 4.3%
of total probability-mass (or frequency-mass) for un-
seen stress patterns. In other words, we would be
surprised to find that the actual population of lan-
guages contains much more than N
1� 1 = 27.15 dis-
N
tinct patterns, i.e., about one more than found in this
sample.

2.3 Gordon’s (2002) Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780285714286">
Gordon (2002) has developed an optimality theo-
retic model of QI stress with the goal of satisfying
the inclusion-exclusion criterion on an earlier subset
of Heinz’s (2007) typology. The model is footless,
consisting of twelve constraints stated in terms of a
metrical grid, without reference to feet or other met-
rical groupings (or, equivalently, simply in terms of
linear {Q, Q, Q}-sequences). The twelve constraints
are summarized in Table 2.
In addition to these, Gordon’s model imple-
ments a sort of “meta-constraint” on rankings: he
assumes that one of the primary alignment con-
straints ALIGN(Q, L/R) is always lowest ranked,
so that in any given tableau either ALIGN(Q, L) or
ALIGN(Q, R) is “active,” but never both. Formally,
we take this to mean that the model specifies two
EVALS: an EVAL-L with ALIGN(Q, R) excluded
from CON, and an EVAL-R with ALIGN(Q, L) ex-
cluded. The set of stress systems predicted by the
whole model is then simply the union of the systems
predicted by EVAL-L and by EVAL-R. This ranking
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999954">
restriction is meant to capture the probably univer-
sal generalization that primary stress always appears
either to the left or right of the secondary stresses
in a word, without vacillating from side to side for
different word lengths. Gordon also assumes that
candidate forms violating culminativity (i.e., forms
without exactly one primary stressed syllable), are
always excluded, either by some filter on the output
of GEN or by an always highly ranked CULMINATE
constraint against them.4
Gordon’s model is capable of representing 2 �
11! = 79,833,600 QI stress grammars (11! rank-
ings of the constraints associated with EVAL-L plus
the 11! rankings for EVAL-R). We replicated Gor-
don’s (2002) calculation of the factorial typology of
distinct QI stress patterns that this grammar space
predicts by implementing the constraints as finite-
state transducers,5 composing the appropriate com-
binations of these to produce finite-state implemen-
tations of EVAL-L and EVAL-R, respectively (see
Riggle, 2004), and iteratively constructing consis-
tent subsets of the members of the cross-products of
candidate forms for each word length (two through
eight syllables). See Riggle et al (2007) and Prince
(2002) for the mathematical and algorithmic details.
The factorial typology of stress systems that is
yielded agrees with that reported by Gordon (2002).
The model predicts a total of 152 distinct possible
systems. All but two of the 26 systems attested
in Heinz’s (2007) database are among these. The
two patterns that Gordon’s model fails to generate
are those of Bhojpuri (as described by Tiwari, 1960;
Shukla, 1981), and Ic¸u˜a Tupi (Abrahamson, 1968).
Both of these patterns were unknown to Gordon at
the time he proposed his model, and each is attested
only once in the typology.
In addition to failing to generate two of the at-
tested stress systems, Gordon’s model also predicts

a kind of counting that cannot generally be accomplished by

sirable property of Gordon’s model (see Heinz et al (2005) for
such a critique), but in any case, this general problem does not
affect us here, as we ignore the possibility of words any longer
than eight syllables (following Gordon; see Section 2.1).

128 patterns that are unattested. Gordon (2002) ar-
gues that a certain amount of overgeneration is to
be expected of any model, since the majority of
distinct attested systems are extremely rare; thus
failure to observe a pattern in a limited sample
is not strong evidence that the pattern is impossi-
ble. The Good-Turing estimate of unseen patterns
(Section 2.2 above), however, suggests that signifi-
cantly less overgeneration may still be desired. Gor-
don also argues that the overgenerated patterns are
not pathologically different from the sorts of pat-
terns that we do see (though Section 3 below de-
scribes several statistically detectable differences).
In any case, Gordon’s model of QI stress is among
the most explicitly formulated approaches currently
available, and offers a comparatively “tight” fit to
the typological data.

greater simplicity (according to some metric) than
those that are rarer. One also expects, according to
this hypothesis, that among the set of patterns pre-
dicted by a linguistic model such as Gordon’s, the
simpler ones should have a greater chance of attes-
tation in typological samples. We find evidence con-
sistent with both of these expectations in the case of
QI stress systems, according to at least one informa-
tion theoretic definition of complexity.
In order to calculate measures of complexity for
each attested and predicted stress pattern, we con-
struct bigram and trigram models of the transi-
tion probabilities between syllable types (Q, Q, Q) in
forms of two through eight syllables for each pat-
tern. That is, if each stress is taken to be a set of
forms as in (1) (with n = 8 in this case), satisfying
(2), then across all forms (i.e., word-lengths) one can
count the number of occurrences of each k-length
sequence (k-gram) of Q, 6,, Q� and word boundaries
to arrive at conditional probabilities for each sylla-
ble type (or a word boundary) given the previous
k−1 syllables. With these probabilities one can then
compute the Shannon entropy of the stress pattern as
an index of its complexity; this is interpreted as the
number of bits needed to describe the pattern (i.e.,
list its forms) under an efficient encoding, given the
k-gram probability model. Stress patterns in which
it is difficult to accurately predict the value of a syl-
lable on the basis of the previous k −1 syllables will
possess greater entropy, and thus be deemed more
complex, than those in which such predictions can
be made with greater accuracy.
We find that in the case of a bigram probability
model (k = 2), the attested stress systems predicted
by Gordon’s model do not differ in entropy signifi-
cantly6 from those that are unattested; we also find
no significant correlation between bigram entropy
and the typological frequency of attested systems.
Under a trigram probability model (k = 3), how-
ever, entropy is a significant predictor of both
whether a system is attested, and if it is attested,
of its frequency in the sample. Figure 3 gives box-
plots comparing the distribution of trigram entropy
for those systems predicted by Gordon’s model (plus
the two unpredicted systems) that are attested ver-
sus those that are unattested. The attested QI stress
systems are significantly less entropic than the unat-
tested, according to a two-sided Mann-Whitney U-
test: U = 1196, p = 0.021 (if the two unpredicted
patterns are excluded, then U = 923.5, p &lt; 0.01).

greater than median frequency have only mildly sig-
nificantly lower entropy than the 13 with less than

terns show much greater variation in their complex-
ity (variance 0.028 square bits/symbol).

The second metric we examine is motivated by con-
siderations of learnability. Some QI stress patterns
are very similar to each other in the sense that one
must observe fairly long forms (i.e., forms with
many syllables) in order to distinguish them from
each other. For instance, in the case of Albanian
and Malakmalak (Table 1 above), the two systems
give identical stress assignments for words of two or
three syllables; to tell them apart, one must com-
pare words with four or more syllables. The de-
gree of similarity, or “confusability” in this sense,
between stress systems varies considerably for dif-
ferent pairs of languages. Assuming a tendency for
short words to be encountered more frequently by
language learners than long words, we might ex-
pect stress patterns that are easily identified at short
word-lengths to be more faithfully acquired than
those requiring longer observations for unambigu-
ous identification. In particular, if we take the 152
patterns predicted by Gordon’s model to constitute
the set of possible QI stress systems, then we hy-
pothesize that those patterns that stand out as unique
at shorter lengths should be more typologically “sta-
ble”: more likely to be attested, more frequently at-
tested, or both.
To test this, we determine a confusability vector
for each predicted pattern. This is simply a tuple of
7 integers in which the value of the ith component
indicates how many of the other 151 predicted pat-
terns the given pattern agrees with on forms of two
through i+1 syllables. For example, the confusabil-

ity vector of Albanian’s (fixed penultimate primary;
see Table 1) stress pattern is:
(101, 39,10, 0, 0, 0, 0)
This means that for words of two syllables, this
stress system agrees with 101 of the other predicted
systems, for words of two through three syllables it
agrees with 39, and for two through four syllables it
agrees with 10. Once words of five or more syllables
are included in the comparison, it is unique among
the stress patterns predicted, confusable with none.
A confusability vector allows us to calculate two
quantities for a given stress pattern: its confusabil-
ity sum, which is just the sum of all the components
of the vector, and a confusability pivot, which is the
number i such that the (i − 1)th component7 of the
vector is the first component with value 0. Thus the
confusability sum of the fixed penultimate primary
stress system is 101+39+10 = 150, and its confus-
ability pivot is 5, indicating that it achieves unique-
ness among Gordon’s predicted systems at five syl-
lables.
We find that those of the predicted systems that
are typologically attested have very significantly
lower confusability pivots than the unattested sys-
tems (see Figure 5; Mann-Whitney U-test: U =
1005.5, p &lt; 0.001). One might wonder whether
this is simply due to the fact that primary-only stress

systems are most likely to be attested, and that such
systems are independently expected to have lower
confusability pivots than those with secondary stress
(indeed, a two-sided Mann-Whitney test indicates
that the pivots of primary-only systems are signifi-
cantly lower: U = 214, p &lt; 0.01). However, it
appears that confusability pivots are in fact indepen-
dently robust predictors of attestedness. When only
the predicted patterns with secondary stress are con-
sidered, the pivots of the attested ones remain signif-
icantly lower than those of the unattested, albeit by
a smaller margin (U = 846, p = 0.027). Confus-
ability sums, on the other hand, are not significant
predictors of attestedness in either case.
Neither pivots nor sums alone correlate well with
the typological frequency of attested systems, but to-
gether they can predict approximately 27% of the
variance in frequencies; a multilinear regression of
the form

3.3 Ranking Volume
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997235">
The two typological predictors discussed above (en-
tropy and confusability) are only weakly “post-
theoretical” in the sense that, while they depend on
a set of predicted stress patterns according to some
linguistic theory or model (such as Gordon’s), they
can be computed without reference to the particular
form of the model. In contrast, the third and last cor-
relate that we consider is entirely specified and mo-
tivated by the optimality theoretic form of Gordon’s
model.
We define the ranking volume, or r-volume, of
a language generated by an optimality theoretic
model as the number of total constraint orderings
(i.e., grammars) that specify the language. Rig-
gle (2008) describes a method of applying the logic
of Prince’s (2002) elementary ranking conditions to
compute this quantity. Using this method, we find
that the number of rankings of Gordon’s constraints
that are consistent with a stress pattern predicted by
his model is a significant correlate of attestedness,

and if the pattern is attested, of its typological fre-
quency. In the case of Gordon’s model, with its
ranking meta-constraint and bifurcated EVAL (as de-
scribed in Section 2.3), the total r-volume of each
pattern is actually the sum of two quantities: the pat-
tern’s r-volume under the 11 constraints correspond-
ing to EVAL-L (which excludes ALIGN(Q, R)), and
its r-volume under the 11 constraints of EVAL-R
(which conversely excludes ALIGN(Q, R)). Most of
the predicted patterns are only generated by one of
the EVALS, but some can be specified by either con-
straint set, and thus will tend to be consistent with
more rankings. It just so happens that Gordon’s
choice of constraints ensures that these doubly gen-
erated patterns are of precisely the same sort that
are typologically most frequent: fixed primary stress
systems. This appears to account for much of the
predictive power of r-volume in this model.
The distribution of r-volume among the 152 pre-
dicted stress patterns is almost perfectly Zipfian.
A nonlinear Gauss-Newton regression of r-volumes
against Zipf’s law finds a highly significant fit (with
Zipf’s exponent = 0.976 + 0.02, p &lt; 0.001) that
accounts for 96.8% of the variance. The attested
patterns tend to have significantly greater r-volumes
than those unattested; two-sided Mann-Whitney’s
U = 2113.5, p &lt; 0.01 (see Figure 6). On aver-

age, the attested stress patterns are consistent with
1,586,437 rankings each, versus 299,118.1 rankings
for the unattested ones.
Furthermore, the frequency of attested patterns
has a strong linear correlation with r-volume: R2 =
0.7236, p &lt; 0.001. However, a linear rela-
tion is probably not appropriate, as a normal Q-Q
plot of the residuals of the regression indicates an
upper-quartile deviation from linearity, and Cook’s
distance metric indicates that several data-points
exert disproportionate influence on the explained
variance. Instead, typological frequency seems to
be better modeled as a function of the logarithm
of the r-volume; Figure 7 illustrates both a lin-
ear (R2 = 0.39, p &lt; 0.05) and exponential
(R2 = 0.704, p &lt; 0.001) fit of frequencies to log-

4 Interpretation and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999138">
The correlates of attestation and frequency reported
here suggest novel ways that linguistic models might
be used to make testable predictions about typol-
ogy. Two of these correlates—k-gram entropy and
confusability—are particularly general, their calcu-
lation requiring only the set of possible languages
or patterns that a model can specify. It remains an
interesting question whether these same quantities
retain predictive power for other sorts of data and
models than are considered here, and whether such
correlations might fruitfully be incorporated into an
evaluation metric for linguistic models.
The r-volume result motivates a particular line of
further research on the nature of constraints in OT:
how exactly the contents of a constraint set deter-
mine the distribution of r-volumes in the factorial
typology. In addition, there are several other po-
tentially relevant concepts in the literature, includ-
ing Anttila’s (1997, 2002, 2007) ranking-counting
model of variation, Anttila and Andrus’ (2006) “T-
orders” and Prince and Tesar’s (1999) “restrictive-
ness measure,” whose relations to r-volume merit
examination. Our results for r-volume in this case
also suggest that a fully generalized notion of para-
metric grammar volume may be worth investigating
across different kinds of models and various typo-
logical phenomena.
Insofar as the three correlates’ strength as typo-
logical predictors depends on the set of stress pat-
terns generated by Gordon’s model, their signif-
icance is consistent with the hypothesis that the
model is useful and has some predictive power. Such
statistical significance is rather surprising, since
Gordon’s model was developed primarily as an at-
tempt to satisfy the inclusion-exclusion criterion,
without any explicit eye toward the kinds of pre-
dictions that these correlates seem to suggest it can
make. This is especially true of r-volume, as it is the
correlate most tightly coupled to the OT particulars
of Gordon’s model. These findings motivate further
research on the general relationship, if any, between
the inclusion-exclusion predictions of a model (opti-
mality theoretic or otherwise) and its frequency pre-
dictions according to the measures presented here.
On the other hand, the entropy and confusability re-
sults suggest the intriguing possibility of discarding
such a model altogether, and instead picking the at-
tested stress systems (and their frequencies) directly
from the large pool of logically possible ones, ac-
cording to these measures and others like them.

For example, Maddieson’s (1984) survey of phonemic inventories finds that a total of 921 distinct sounds are used by a sample of 451 languages, yet the average language employs only about 30 of those. Furthermore, some sounds are so commonly attested as to be almost universal (e.g., /m/, /k/), while others are vanishingly rare (/x/, /œ/). Heinz (2007) combines two previous typologies of accentual stress (Bailey, 1995; Gordon, 2002), and finds that among a sample of 306 languages with quantity-insensitive (QI) stress systems, 26 distinct stress patterns are found,1 while over 60% of the languages surveyed use one of just 3 of these patterns. If we begin to look at morphosyntactic or semantic properties, the combinatorics of 1These figures include only those quantity-insensitive stress patterns according to which there is exactly one possible assignment of stress per word length in syllables. 29 possible systems veritably explodes, leaving each attested language with an even smaller slice of the logical pos</context>

The latter is rather more complex, requiring stress on even numbered syllables from the right, the leftmost being primary.

For example, Maddieson’s (1984) survey of phonemic inventories finds that a total of 921 distinct sounds are used by a sample of 451 languages, yet the average language employs only about 30 of those. Furthermore, some sounds are so commonly attested as to be almost universal (e.g., /m/, /k/), while others are vanishingly rare (/x/, /œ/). Heinz (2007) combines two previous typologies of accentual stress (Bailey, 1995; Gordon, 2002), and finds that among a sample of 306 languages with quantity-insensitive (QI) stress systems, 26 distinct stress patterns are found,1 while over 60% of the languages surveyed use one of just 3 of these patterns. If we begin to look at morphosyntactic or semantic properties, the combinatorics of 1These figures include only those quantity-insensitive stress patterns according to which there is exactly one possible assignment of stress per word length in syllables. 29 possible systems veritably explodes, leaving each attested language with an even smaller slice of the logical possibilities.

Comparatively few attempts have been made to explain or predict the relative frequencies with which languages or patterns are observed to occur in crosslinguistic samples (though see Liljencrants and Lindblom 1972, de Boer 2000, Moreton to appear, and others for work proceeding in this direction). This paper examines the typology of QI stress systems, as reported by Heinz (2007), and asks to what extent an existing optimality theoretic (Prince and Smolensky, 1993) model of QI stress, developed by Gordon (2002) to meet the inclusion-exclusion criterion, can predict the observed typological frequencies of stress patterns. Gordon’s model predicts a total of 152 possible stress patterns, which, as far as we are aware, represent the current best attempt at satisfying the inclusion-exclusion criterion for QI stress, failing to generate only two attested stress patterns (unknown to Gordon at the time), and generating 128 unattested patterns. We show that Gordon’s model can offer at least three novel, statistically significant predictors of which of the 152 generated patterns are actually attested, and of </context>

Finally, Section 4 offers a discussion of the interpretation of these findings, as well as some concluding remarks. 2 Quantity-Insensitive Stress Patterns 2.1 Assumptions and Definitions We will follow Gordon (2002) and Heinz (2007) in taking a stress system to be any accentual system that satisfies “culminativity” in the sense of Prince (1983); that is, any accentual system in which there is always one most prominent accentual unit per accentual domain. In this case, we assume that the accentual unit is the syllable, and that the domain is the prosodic word. Thus, any given syllable of a word may bear primary, secondary, or no stress (we ignore the possibility of tertiary or other stress), but there must always be exactly one primary stressed syllable per word.

The model is footless, consisting of twelve constraints stated in terms of a metrical grid, without reference to feet or other metrical groupings (or, equivalently, simply in terms of linear {Q, Q, Q}-sequences). The twelve constraints are summarized in Table 2. In addition to these, Gordon’s model implements a sort of “meta-constraint” on rankings: he assumes that one of the primary alignment constraints ALIGN(Q, L/R) is alway</context>

See Riggle et al (2007) and Prince (2002) for the mathematical and algorithmic details. The factorial typology of stress systems that is yielded agrees with that reported by Gordon (2002). The model predicts a total of 152 distinct possible systems. All but two of the 26 systems attested in Heinz’s (2007) database are among these. The two patterns that Gordon’s model fails to generate are those of Bhojpuri (as described by Tiwari, 1960; Shukla, 1981), and Ic¸u˜a Tupi (Abrahamson, 1968). Both of these patterns were unknown to Gordon at the time he proposed his model, and each is attested only once in the typology. In addition to failing to generate two of the attested stress systems, Gordon’s model also predicts 4We follow Gordon in remaining agnostic on this point, as the same</context>

Gordon (2002) argues that a certain amount of overgeneration is to be expected of any model, since the majority of distinct attested systems are extremely rare; thus failure to observe a pattern in a limited sample is not strong evidence that the pattern is impossible. The Good-Turing estimate of unseen patterns (Section 2.2 above), however, suggests that significantly less overgeneration may still be desired.

The distribution of patterns is essentially Zipfian; a nonlinear regression of the frequencies against Zipf’s law (using the Gauss-Newton method) achieves strong statistical significance (p &lt;</context>

We will refer to this goal as the “inclusionexclusion” criterion of a linguistic model. Comparatively few attempts have been made to explain or predict the relative frequencies with which languages or patterns are observed to occur in crosslinguistic samples (though see Liljencrants and Lindblom 1972, de Boer 2000, Moreton to appear, and others for work proceeding in this direction). This paper examines the typology of QI stress systems, as reported by Heinz (2007), and asks to what extent an existing optimality theoretic (Prince and Smolensky, 1993) model of QI stress, developed by Gordon (2002) to meet the inclusion-exclusion criterion, can predict the observed typological frequencies of stress patterns. Gordon’s model predicts a total of 152 possible stress patterns, which, as far as we are aware, represent the current best attempt at satisfying the inclusion-exclusion criterion for QI stress, failing to generate only two attested stress patterns (unknown to Gordon at the time), and generating 128 unattested patterns. We show that Gordon’s model can offer at least three novel, statistically significant predictors of which of the 152 ge</context>

Section 3 then introduces the three proposed correlates of attestedness and frequency that can be applied to Gordon’s framework, together with statistical analyses of their significance as predictors. Finally, Section 4 offers a discussion of the interpretation of these findings, as well as some concluding remarks. 2 Quantity-Insensitive Stress Patterns 2.1 Assumptions and Definitions We will follow Gordon (2002) and Heinz (2007) in taking a stress system to be any accentual system that satisfies “culminativity” in the sense of Prince (1983); that is, any accentual system in which there is always one most prominent accentual unit per accentual domain. In this case, we assume that the accentual unit is the syllable, and that the domain is the prosodic word. Thus, any given syllable of a word may bear primary, secondary, or no stress (we ignore the possibility of tertiary or other stress), but there must always be exactly one primary stressed syllable per word. We further restrict our attention in this study to quantity-insensitive (QI) stress systems, which are those stress systems according to which the assignment of stresses to </context>

In contrast, the third and last correlate that we consider is entirely specified and motivated by the optimality theoretic form of Gordon’s model. We define the ranking volume, or r-volume, of a language generated by an optimality theoretic model as the number of total constraint orderings (i.e., grammars) that specify the language. Riggle (2008) describes a method of applying the logic of Prince’s (2002) elementary ranking conditions to compute this quantity. Using this method, we find that the number of rankings of Gordon’s constraints that are consistent with a stress pattern predicted by his model is a significant correlate of attestedness, log(r−volume) Attested Unattested Figure 6: Of the predicted stress patterns, those that are attested are consistent with significantly more constraintrankings.
