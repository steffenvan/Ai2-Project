<bodyText confidence="0.999914789473684">
The syntactic analysis of languages with respect to
Government-binding (GB) grammar is a problem
that has received relatively little attention until
recently. This paper describes an attribute grammar
specification of the Government-binding theory. The
paper focuses on the description of the attribution
rules responsible for determining antecedent-trace
relations in phrase-structure trees, and on some
theoretical implications of those rules for the GB
model. The specification relies on a
transformation- less variant of Government-binding
theory, briefly discussed by Chomsky (1981), in
which the rule move-a is replaced by an interpretive
rule. Here the interpretive rule is specified by means
of attribution rules. The attribute grammar is
currently being used to write an English parser
which embodies the principles of GB theory. The
parsing strategy and attribute evaluation scheme
are cursorily described at the end of the paper.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999902106060606">
In this paper we consider the use of attribute gram-
mars (Knuth, 1968; Waite and Goos, 1984) to pro-
vide a computational definition of the Government-
binding theory layed out by Chomsky (1981, 1982).
This research thus constitutes a move in the direc-
tion of seeking specific mechanisms and realizations
of universal grammar. The attribute grammar pro-
vides a specification at a level intermediate between
the abstract principles of GB theory and the partic-
ular automatons that may be used for parsing or
generation of the language described by the theory.
Almost by necessity and the nature of the goal set
out, there will be several arbitrary decisions and
details of realization that are not dictated by any
particular linguistic or psychological facts, but
perhaps only by matters of style and possible com-
putational efficiency considerations in the final pro-
duct. It is therefore safe to assume that the partic-
ular attribute grammar that will be arrived at
admits of a large number of non-isomorphic vari-
ants, none of which is to be preferred over the oth-
ers a priori. The specification given here is for
English. Similar specifications of the parametrized
grammars of typologically different languages may
eventually lead to substantive generalizations about
the computational mechanisms employed in natural
languages.
The purpose of this research is twofold: First,
to provide a precise computational definition of
Government-binding theory, as its core ideas are
generally understood. We thus begin to provide an
answer to criticisms that have recently been leveled
against the theory regarding its lack of formal expli-
citness (Gazdar et al., 1985; Pullum, 1985). Unlike
earlier computational models of GB theory, such as
that of Berwick and Weinberg (1984), which
assumes Marcus&apos; (1980) parsing automaton, the
attribute grammar specification is more abstract
and neutral regarding the choice of parsing auto-
mata. Attribute grammar offers a language
specification framework whose formal properties are
generally well-understood and explored. A second
and more important purpose of the present research
is to provide an alternate and mechanistic charac-
terization of the principles of universal grammar.
To the extent that the implementation is correct,
the principles may be shown to follow from the sys-
tem of attributes in the grammar and the attribu-
tion rules that define their values.
The current version of the attribute grammar
is presently being used to implement an English
parser written in Prolog. Although the parser is not
yet complete, we expect that its breath of coverage
of the language will be substantially larger than
that of other Government-binding parsers recently
reported in the literature (Kashket (1986), Kuhns
(1986), Sharp (1985), and Wehrli (1984)). Since the
parser is firmly based on Government-binding
theory, we expect its ability to handle natural
language phenomena to be limited only by the accu-
racy and correctness of the underlying theory.
In the development below I will assume that
the reader is familiar with the basic concepts and
terminology of Government-binding theory, as well
as with attribute grammars. The reader is referred
to Sells (1985) for a good introduction to the

grammars.

The Grammatical Model Assumed
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994554375">
For the attribute grammar specification we assume
a transformation-less variant of Government-
binding theory, briefly discussed by Chomsky (1981,
p.89-92), in which rule move-a is eliminated in favor
of a system M. of interpretive rules which deter-
mines antecedent-trace relations. A more explicit
proposal of a similar nature is also made by Koster
(1978). We assume a context-free base, satisfying
the principles of X&apos;-theory, which generates directly
structure trees at a surface structure level of
representation. S-structure may be derived from
surface structure by application of Ma. The rest of
the theory remains as in standard Government-
binding (except for some obvious reformulation of
principles that refer to Grammatical Functions at
D-Structure).
The grammatical model that obtains is that
of (1). The base generates surface structures, with
phrases in their surface places along with empty
categories where appropriate. Surface structure is
identical to S-structure, except for the fact that the
association between moved phrases and their traces
is not present; chain indices that reveal history of
movement in the transformational account are not
present. The interpretive system Ma, here defined
by attribution rules, then applies to construct the
absent chains and thus establish the linking rela-
tions between arguments and positions in the argu-
ment structures of their predicates, yielding the 5-
structure level. In this manner the operations form-
erly carried out by transformations reduce to attri-
bute computations on phrase-structure trees.

I sketch briefly how the interpretive system Ma is
defined. Two attributes node and Chain are associ-
ated with NP, and a method for functionally classi-
fying empty categories in structure trees is
developed (relying on conditions of Government and
Case-marking). In addition, two attributes A-Chain
and A&amp;quot; -Chain are defined for every syntactic
category which may be found in the c-command
domain of NP. In particular, A-Chain and A - -
Chain are defined for C, COMP&apos;, S, INFL&apos;, VP, and
V&apos; (assuming Chomsky&apos;s (1986) two-level X&apos;-
system). The meanings attached to these attributes
are as follows. Node defines a preorder enumeration
of tree nodes; Chain is an integer that represents
the syntactic chain to which an NP belongs;
A —Chain (I —Chain) determines whether an argu-
ment (non-argument) chain propagates across a
given node of a tree, and gives the number of that
chain, if any.
Somewhat arbitrarily, and for the sake of
concreteness, we assume that a chain is identified by
the node number of the phrase that heads the chain.
For the root node, the attribution rules dic-
tate A —Chain —Chain ---- 0. The two attri-
butes are then essentially percolated downwards.
However, whenever a lexical NP or PRO is found in
a e-position, an argument chain is started, setting
the value of A —Chain to the node number of the
NP found, which is used to identify the new chain.
Thus NP traces in the c-command domain of the
NP are able to identify their antecedent. Similarly,
when a Wh-phrase is found in COMP specifier posi-
tion, the value of —Chain is set to the chain
number of that phrase, and lower Wh-traces may
pick up their antecedent in a similar fashion.
Downwards propagation of the attributes
A —Chain and A- —Chain explains in a simple way
the observed c-command constraint between a trace
and its antecedent.
The precise statement of the attribution rules
that implement the interpretive rule described is
given in Appendix A. In the formulation of the
attribution rules, it is assumed that certain other
components of Government-binding theory have
already been implemented, in particular parts of
Government and Case theories, which contribute to
the functional determination of empty categories.
The implementation of the relevant parts of these
subtheories is described elsewhere (Correa, in
preparation). We assume that all empty categories
are base-generated, as instances of the same EC
[Am el. Their types are then determined structur-
ally, in manner similar to the proposal made by
Koster (1978). The attributes empty, pronominal,
and anaphoric used by the interpretive system
achieve a full functional partitioning of NP types
(van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986), p.278); their

values are defined by attribution rules in Appendix
B, relying on the values of the attributes Governor
and Cases . The values of these attributes are in
turn determined by the Government and Case
theories, respectively, and indicate the relevant
governor of the NP and grammatical Case assigned
to it.
The claim associated with the interpretive
rule, as it is implemented in Appendix A, is that
given a surface structure in the sense defined above,
it will derive the correct antecedent-trace relations
after it applies. An illustrative sample of its opera-
tion is provided in (3), where the (simplified) struc-
ture tree of sentence (2) is shown. The annotations
superscripted to the C, COMP&apos;, S, INFL&apos;, VP, and
V&apos; nodes are the A -Chain and X -Chain attri-
butes, respectively. Thus, for the root node, the
value of both attributes is zero. Similarly, the
superscripts on the NP nodes represent the node
and Chain attributes of the NP. The last NP in
the tree, complement of &apos;love&apos;, thus bears node
number 5 and belongs to Chain 1.

Some Theoretical Implications: Bounding
Nodes and Subjacency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999515">
In Government-binding theory it is assumed that
the set of bounding nodes that a language may
select is not fixed across human languages, but is
open to parametric variation. Rizzi (1978) observed
that in Italian the Subjacency condition is systemat-
ically violated by double Wh-extraction construc-
tions, as in (4.a), if one assumes for Italian the same
set of bounding nodes as for English. The analogous
construction (4.b) is also possible in Spanish. A
solution, considered by Rizzi to explain the gram-
maticality of (4), is to assume that in Italian and
Spanish, COMP specifier position may be &amp;quot;doubly
filled&amp;quot; in the course of a transformational deriva-
tion, while requiring that it be not doubly filled (by
non-empty phrases) at S-Structure. Thus both
moved phrases &apos;a cui&apos; and &apos;che stone&apos; can move to
the lowest COMP position in the first transforma-
tional cycle, while in the second cycle &apos;a cui&apos; may
move to the next higher COMP and &apos;che stone&apos;
stays in the first COMP.

A second solution, which is the one adopted
by Rizzi and constitutes the currently accepted
explanation of the (apparent) Subjacency violation,
is to assume that Italian and Spanish select C and
NP as bounding nodes, a set different from that of
English. The first phrase &apos;che stone&apos; may then
move to the lowest COMP position in the first
transformational cycle, while the second, &apos;a cui&apos;,
moves in the next cycle in one step to the next
higher position, crossing two S nodes but, crucially,
only one C node. Thus Subjacency is satisfied if C,
not S, is taken as a bounding node.

preoccupato.
Your brother, to whom I wonder what stories
they have told, was very worried.
b. Tu hermano, [a quien], me pregunto Nue
historiash le habran contado e e„ estaba
muy preocupado.
The empirical data that arguably distin-
guishes between the two proposed solutions is (5.a).
While the &amp;quot;doubly filled&amp;quot; COMP hypothesis allows
indefinitely long Wh-chains with doubly filled
COMPs, making it possible for a Wh-chain element
and its successor to skip more than one COMP posi-
tion that already contains some Wh-phrase, the
&amp;quot;bounding node&amp;quot; hypothesis states that at most one
filled COMP position may be skipped. Thus, the
second hypothesis, but not the first, correctly
predicts the ungrammaticality of (5.a).
(5) a. * Juan, [a quien], no me imagino [cuanta

Juan, whom I can&apos;t imagine how many people
know where they have sent, disappeared yes-
terday.
b. La Gorgona, [a donde], no me imagino
Icuanta genteh e, sabe [a quienes]k han
mandado ek e,, es una bella isla.
La Gorgona, to where I can&apos;t imagine how
many people know whom they have sent, is a
beautiful island.
One might observe, however, that (5.a), even
if it satisfies subjacency, violates Pesetsky&apos;s (1982)
Path Containment Condition (PCC). Thus, on these
grounds, (5.a) does not decide between the two
hypotheses. The grammaticality of (5.b), on the
other hand, which is structurally similar to (5.a) but
satisfies the PCC, argues in favor of the &amp;quot;doubly
filled&amp;quot; COMP hypothesis. The Wh-phrase &apos;a donde&apos;
moves from its D-Structure position to the surface
position, skipping two intermediate COMP posi-
tions. This is possible if we assume the doubly filled
COMP hypothesis, and would violate Subjacency
under the alternate hypothesis, even if C is taken as
the bounding node. We expect a similar pattern
(5.b) to be also valid in Italian.
Movement across doubly filled COMP nodes,
satisfying Pesetsky&apos;s (1982) Path Containment Con-
dition, may be explained computationally if we
assume that the type of the I —Chain attribute on
chain nodes is a last-in/first.-out (lifo) stack of
integers, into which the integers identifying I-chain
heads are pushed as they are first encountered, and
from which chain identifiers are dropped as the
chains are terminated. If we further assume that
the type of the attribute is universal, we may
explain the typological difference between Italian
and English, as it refers to the Subjacency condi-
tion, by assuming the presence of an I—Chain
atack depth bound, which is parametrized by univer-
sal grammar, and has the values 1 for English, and
2 (or possibly more) for Italian and Spanish.
To conclude this section, it is worth to review
the manner in which the subjacency facts are
explained by the present attribute grammar imple-
mentation. Notice first that there is no particular
set of categories in the theory that have been
declared as Bounding categories. There is no special
procedure that checks that the Subjacency condi-
tion is actually satisfied by, say, traversing paths
between adjacent chain elements in a tree and
counting bounding nodes. Instead, the facts follow
from the attribution rules that determine the values
of the attributes A —Chain and I—Chain . This
can be verified by inspection of the possible cases of
movement.
Thus, NP-movement is from object or INFL
specifier position to the nearest INFL specifier which
c-commands the extraction site. Similarly, Wh-
movement is from object, INFL specifier, or COMP
specifier position to the nearest c-commanding
COMP specifier. If the bound on the depth of the
—Chain stack is 1, either S or COMP&apos; (but not
both) may be taken as bounding node, and Wh-
island phenomena are observable. If the bound is 2
or greater, then C is the closest approximation to a
bounding node (although cf. (5.b)), and Wh-island
violations which satisfy the PCC are possible. NP
is a bounding node as a consequence of the strong
condition that no chain spans across an NP node,
which in turn is a consequence of the rules (ii.e) in
Appendix A.

Parser Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981314285714">
A prototype of the English parser is currently being
developed using the Prolog logic programming
language. As mentioned in the introduction, the
attribute grammar specification is neutral regarding
the choice of parsing automaton. Thus, several
suitable parser construction techniques (Aho and
Ullman, 1972) may be used to derive a parser. The
context-free base used by the attribute grammar is
an X&apos;-grammar, essentially as in Jackendoff (1977),
although some modifications have been made. In
particular, following Chomsky (1986) we assume
that maximal projections have uniformly bar-level 2
and that S is a projection of INFL, not V, as Jack-
endoff assumes. The base, due to left-recursion in
several productions, is not LR(k), for any k.
We have developed a parser which is essen-
tially LL(1), and incorporates a stack depth bound
which is linearly related to the length of the input
string. Prolog&apos;s backtracking mechanism provides
the means for obtaining alternate parses of syntacti-
cally ambiguous sentences. The parser performs rea-
sonably well with a good number of constructions
and, due to the stack bound, avoids potentially
infinite derivations which could arise due to the
application of mutually recursive rules. Attributes
are implemented by logical variables which are asso-
ciated with tree nodes (cf. Arbab, 1986). Most attri-
butes can be evaluated in a preorder traversal of the
parse tree, and thus attribute evaluation may be
combined with LL(1) parser actions. Notable excep-
tions to this evaluation order are the attributes
Governor, Cases, and es associated with the NP in
INFL specifier position. The value of these attri-
butes cannot be determined until the main verb of
the relevant clause is found.

Conclusions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986188125">
We have presented a computational specification of
a fragment of Government-binding theory with
potentially far-reaching theoretical and practical
implications. From a theoretical point of view, the
present attribute grammar specification offers a
fairly concrete framework which may be used to
study the development and stable state of human
linguistic competence. From a more practical point
of view, the attribute grammar serves as a starting
point for the development of high quality parsers for
natural languages. To the extent that the
specification is explanatorily adequate, the language
described by the grammar (recognized by the
parser) may be changed by altering the values of
the universal parameters in the grammar and
changing the underlying lexicon.

This paper describes an attribute grammar specification of the Government-binding theory. The paper focuses on the description of the attribution rules responsible for determining antecedent-trace relations in phrase-structure trees, and on some theoretical implications of those rules for the GB model.

In the formulation of the attribution rules, it is assumed that certain other components of Government-binding theory have already been implemented, in particular parts of Government and Case theories, which contribute to the functional determination of empty categories. The implementation of the relevant parts of these subtheories is described elsewhere (Correa, in preparation). We assume that all empty categories are base-generated, as instances of the same EC [Am el. Their types are then determined structurally, in manner similar to the proposal made by Koster (1978). The attributes empty, pronominal, and anaphoric used by the interpretive system achieve a full functional partitioning of NP types (van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986), p.278); their 46 values are defined by attribution rules in Appendix B, relying on the values of the attributes Governor and Cases . The values of these attributes are in turn determined by the Government and Case theories, respectively, and indicate the relevant governor of the NP and grammatical Case assigned to it.

The last NP in the tree, complement of &apos;love&apos;, thus bears node number 5 and belongs to Chain 1. Some Theoretical Implications: Bounding Nodes and Subjacency In Government-binding theory it is assumed that the set of bounding nodes that a language may select is not fixed across human languages, but is open to parametric variation. Rizzi (1978) observed that in Italian the Subjacency condition is systematically violated by double Wh-extraction constructions, as in (4.a), if one assumes for Italian the same set of bounding nodes as for English. The analogous construction (4.b) is also possible in Spanish. A solution, considered by Rizzi to explain the grammaticality of (4), is to assume that in Italian and Spanish, COMP specifier position may be &amp;quot;doubly filled&amp;quot; in the course of a transformational derivation, while requiring that it be not doubly filled (by non-empty phrases) at S-Structure.

The specification relies on a transformation- less variant of Government-binding theory, briefly discussed by Chomsky (1981), in which the rule move-a is replaced by an interpretive rule. Here the interpretive rule is specified by means of attribution rules. The attribute grammar is currently being used to write an English parser which embodies the principles of GB theory. The parsing strategy and attribute evaluation scheme are cursorily described at the end of the paper. Introduction In this paper we consider the use of attribute grammars (Knuth, 1968; Waite and Goos, 1984) to provide a computational definition of the Governmentbinding theory layed out by Chomsky (1981, 1982). This research thus constitutes a move in the direction of seeking specific mechanisms and realizations of universal grammar. The attribute grammar provides a specification at a level intermediate between the abstract principles of GB theory and the particular automatons that may be used for parsing or generation of the language described by the theory. Almost by necessity and the nature of the goal set out, there will be several arbitrary decisions and details of realization that are not d</context>

The Grammatical Model Assumed For the attribute grammar specification we assume a transformation-less variant of Governmentbinding theory, briefly discussed by Chomsky (1981, p.89-92), in which rule move-a is eliminated in favor of a system M. of interpretive rules which determines antecedent-trace relations. A more explicit proposal of a similar nature is also made by Koster (1978). We assume a context-free base, satisfying the principles of X&apos;-theory, which generates directly structure trees at a surface structure level of representation. S-</context>
