Logos Machine Translation System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999273375">
Logos Corporation has been involved in machine translation R&amp;D for over 27 years.
From an English-Vietnamese system produced in 1972 to the latest releases of our
software we have striven to produce the best machine translation (MT) software
available. Today the Logos system is one of the best commercial MT systems on the
market.
Our architecture coupled with experience in the commercial sector has made us a
leader in providing solutions in our users&apos; translation work. Logos does not claim to
replace human translators; rather, we seek to enhance the professional translator&apos;s
work environment.
The Logos system is fundamentally different from other computer-based translation
programs. In addition to the easily extensible dictionaries with their underlying semantic
foundation, Logos offers mechanisms that permit meanings to be deduced using
contextual clues. These permit problem cases, such as concepts with completely
separate meanings or subtle variations, to be translated suitably.
Logos analyzes whole source sentences, considering morphology, meaning, and
grammatical structure and function. The analysis determines the semantic relationships
between words as well as the syntactic structure of the sentence. Parsing is only source
language-specific; generation is target language-specific. Although the Logos system
was originally developed on the basis of a transfer approach, this has evolved in time to
the present in which clear interlingual features are inherent in the system.
Unlike other commercial systems the Logos system relies heavily on semantic analysis.
Using our proprietary Semantico-Syntactic Abstraction Language (SAL) the parser is
able to achieve better results than syntactic analysis alone would allow.
This comprehensive analysis permits the Logos system to construct a complete and
idiomatically correct translation in the target language. All aspects of the sentence
contribute to the result.
The Logos system is an outstanding example of applying computational linguistics in
the commercial sector.
Our exhibit at the 5th Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing will offer live
demonstrations of the Logos Translation Express&amp;quot;&apos; system. This Internet-based
system allows users to submitted formatted documents for translation to our server and
retrieve translated documents without loss of formatting.
