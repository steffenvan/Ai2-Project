1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999724823529412">
Nowadays, very large volume of texts are created and
stored in computer, and as a result the retrieval of texts
which fits to a user&apos;s demand has become a difficult prob-
lem. Hypertext is a typical system to answer this prob-
lem, whose primary objective is to establish flexible as-
sociative links between relevant text parts and to allow
users to select and trace links to see relevant text con-
tents which are connected by links. A difficult problem
here is how to construct automatically a network struc-
ture in a given set of text data. This paper is concerned
with (1) automatic conversion of a plain text set into
a hypertext structure, and (2) construction of flexible
human interface for the hypertext system. We applied
natural language processing methods to locate impor-
tant conceptual terms in a text corpus and to establish
varieties of links between these terms and appropriate
text portions.

2 Extraction of thesaurus information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995338">
The text corpus we handled as a concrete example was
the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Computer Science (here-
after abbreviated as EDCS. Iwanami Publ. 1990. En-
glish translation will appear soon from Academic Press).
It includes 4500 terms and has the text volume of two
million Japanese characters (4 Mega bytes).
The first part of the term description of EDCS is
devoted to synonyms, antonyms, abbreviations and
broader concept words. This part has typical sentential
styles such as,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.838791">
(i) A is {sometimes, often, also, commonly, ...} {called,
written, named, expressed, _} as B, C, ..., or D.
(ii) A is abbreviated as B.
(iii) A is {an abbreviation, a contraction, ...} of B.
(iv) A stands for B.
(v) We call A B {for short}.
(vi) A is B. A is included in B.
(vii) A is called as B, so C as D.
By finding these sentential patterns the relation between
the words A and B is established as follows.
(i) p-link is set up from a synonym word to a sen-
tence which defines the synonym relation.
(ii) s-link (by synonym) is set up from a defined word
to defining words by synonym relation.
Typical sentential styles of intensional definition are:
(i) A is defined as B. A is regarded as B.
(ii) A means B. A connotes B. A is B.
(iii) A is a {kind, form, way, branch, method, ...} of B.
(iv) A is regarded as B, so C as D.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99874675">
By identifying these patterns in a term description part,
the relation between the defined word (A) and the defi-
nition sentences is established as:
(i) p-link is set up from the defined word to the
definition sentence when the defined word is not
the headword of the term description. This is the
case when the defined word is not so important as
a headword of the dictionary, and so a rather sim-
ple definition description is embedded in the term
description.
(ii) s-link (by synonym) is set up between the defined
words in the above word extraction process if there
are plurals of the defined words.
isa-link is established between a narrower concept
word (A) and a broader concept word (B) as A isa B.
Here A and B are descriptors which represent other syn-
onym words. isa thesaurus is first established for the
words defined by intensional definitions. By utilizing
this thesaurus extensional definitions are analyzed to get
words of broader/narrower relation defined by these sen-
tences (refer to the next section). Then the thesaurus is
reformulated by the addition of new words which have
isa relation, and which are obtained from extensional
definitions.

3 Extraction of other information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990005333333333">
Sentences of extensional definition introduce examples
and narrower concept words of the defined words. Typ-
ical sentential styles of the extensional definition are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990139666666667">
(i) A is {divided, classified, ...} into B, C, ..., and D.
(ii) A includes B, C, ..., and D.
(iii) There exist B, C, ..., and D {in, for} A.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6395125">
From these sentences we get the information that A
is a defined word, and B, C, ..., and D are narrower (or

lower) concept words. However, there are sometimes the
cases where the above sentential styles do not necessarily
mean the expected definitions. Therefore to make sure
the relations A and B, C, ..., and D are the expected one,
we introduced a simple checking procedure as follows.
(i) the semantic category of the narrower concept words
must be the same as that of the defined word.
(ii) isa thesaurus is checked to see no contradiction be-
tween the defined word and its narrower concept
words.
By identifying the above sentential patterns in a term
description just after the intensional definition sentences,
the relation between the defined word (A) and its nar-
rower term (B, C, D) is established as:
(i) p-link is set up from a narrower term to its
defining sentences which include the word by the
condition that the narrower term is not the head-
word of the dictionary.
(ii) The extracted words have broader/narrower rela-
tion and are included in the isa thesaurus, and are
given s-links (by isa).
We tried to extract functional relations between words
from the definitional sentences. The extraction is mainly
performed by checking the sentential structure and par-
ticularly the verb property of the defining sentences, and
additional checking is done for the consistency between
A and B (Table 1). Links are established from A to B
by s-links with meaning attributes shown in Table 1.
EDCS has, besides the term description, the word tree
which is similar to a thesaurus, and which shows graphi-
cally the structure of the whole area of computer science.
Word tree is stored in computer by s-link, and p-link is
established from a word in the word tree to the cor-
responding term description, p-link is also established
from an index word to the text portion in which the in-
dex word is included. The term description has reference
words at the end of the term description. This reference
is done by s-link.

4 Retrieval system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999612542857143">
Information retrieval can be done from varieties of as-
pects by tracing p- and s-links. A user can start the
dictionary consultation by giving an arbitrary word(W),
the meaning of which he or she wants to know.
When W is a headword the term description of W
is displayed.
When W is an index word the term description
which includes the explanation of the index word
is displayed with the special mark of that explana-
tion part. When there are several terms to W, these
candidates are shown with simple explanations, and
the user can choose one of them for more detailed
description.
When W is a basic componential word of some com-
pound words these words are shown to the user to
select a proper compound word. Then the process
(ii) is activated.
When W is not in the above categories the text
search for the whole text data of the dictionary can
be started. The full text search will be completed
in a few seconds, and all the matched parts can be
displayed by KWIC representation.
A user can see on the display the part of the word
tree which includes W when it is a headword, and
can understand the relative situation of the word
W in relation to other words in the wider scope of
the computer science field. The user can point any
word in the word tree to see its details.
When the term description of a headword is dis-
played on the screen, any word on the screen can
be marked, and the process of (i) (v) can be ac-
tivated from the marked word.
A user can ask what are the words which are related
to W by a certain functional relation, and can go to
the process (i) (v) with these words.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999259375">
Automatic linking of index words with the corresponding
text portions by p-links was compared with the indices
in the published book, which were given by human. We
can say that a fairly good coincidence is obtained. Some
links which are set by automatic process are not proper,
but there are many links which were not set up by human
by his or her carelessness. The appropriateness of the s-
links which are set by automatic process was checked by
random sampling, and 92% of the links was recognized
as appropriate.
The evaluation result shows that the language pro-
cessing introduced into the structuring of a large vol-
ume of text data of the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Com-
puter Science as a hypertext system was successful. This
method is widely applicable for the hypertext construc-
tion of varieties of dictionaries.
