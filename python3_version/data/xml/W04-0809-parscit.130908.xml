Point (a) is done by merging manually con-
structed SCF distributions2 of 4-5 represen-
tative verbs using linear interpolation (e.g.,
(Manning and Schiitze, 1999)). For example,
the back-off estimates for the class of &amp;quot;Motion
verbs&amp;quot; are constructed by merging the SCF dis-
tributions for 4-5 &amp;quot;Motion verbs&amp;quot; e.g., move,
slide, arrive, travel, and sail.
For (b), we combine the different back-off es-
timates using linear interpolation (Chen and
Goodman, 1996) so that the contribution of
each set of estimates is weighted according to
the frequency of the corresponding senses in cor-
pus data. Let p3(scf,), j =1...nbo (where nbo
is the number of back-off estimates) be the prob-
abilities of SCFs in different back-off distribu-
tions. The estimated probability of the SCF in
the resulting combined back-off distribution is
calculated as follows:

where the A3 denote weights for the different
distributions and sum to 1. The values for A.
are determined specific to a verb and are ob-
tained by converting the output of a WSD sys-
tem into probability distributions on senses for
each word.
As a final step, a simple empirically deter-
mined threshold is used on the probability esti-
mates after smoothing to filter out noisy SCFs.

Preiss et al. (2002) showed that high frequency
polysemous verbs whose predominant sense is
not very frequent are likely to benefit most from
WSD. We chose 29 of these verbs for inves-
tigation.3 The verbs were chosen at random,
subject to the constraint that they occur in
the SEMCOR data in at least two broad Levin-
style senses. To ensure that we cover all (or
most) senses of these verbs, the WordNet senses
of these verbs were mapped to Levin senses.
Senses very low in frequency and those which
could not be mapped to any extant Levin-style
senses were left out of consideration. The max-

WordNet senses, as Levin assumes more coarse-
grained sense distinctions than WordNet. The
29 verbs are presented in Table 1, together with
the number of Levin senses distinguished for
each verb.
The test corpus for this task consisted of
around 1000 sentences for each verb drawn from
the BNC. For each verb, WSD systems were
asked to annotate every occurrence of the verb
in its associated corpus, and each annotation
is converted into a probability distribution on
senses.4 The 1000 probability distributions are
averaged, to produce an overall probability dis-
tribution for the verb, which is used to guide
the construction of back-off estimates in SCF
acquisition.5

The results obtained using the new back-off esti-
mates were evaluated against a manual analysis
of the corpus data which was was obtained by
analysing about 300 occurrences for each test
verb in our BNC test data. 5-21 gold standard
SCFs were found for each verb (16 SCFs per
verb on average).
We calculated type precision (the percentage
of SCF types that the system proposes which
are correct), type recall (the percentage of SCF
types in the gold standard that the system pro-
poses) and F-measure. We also calculated the
similarity between the acquired unfiltered and
gold standard SCF distributions using various
measures of distributional similarity (see Korho-
nen and Preiss (2003) for details of these mea-
sures).

mance on the accuracy of SCF acquisition. The
summary of basic results is presented in Table 2.
The table gives the values for the baseline sys-
tems (no smoothing, and smoothing with the
most frequent sense), and for the SCF system
combined with the WSD system. The WSD
smoothed SCF yields a 2.2% better F-measure
than smoothing with the most frequent sense,
which in turn yields a 6.8% higher F-measure
than not smoothing at all. The effect of WSD
was clear also on the measures of distributional
similarity. These figures show that the WSD
system improves SCF acquisition.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of this task
in ranking systems, we investigated the corre-
lation between the F-measure of WSD systems
(on a gold standard task) and the F-measure on
the SCF task. Preiss&apos; probabilistic WSD system
is modular, with modules based on frequency of
sense from WordNet, part of speech of the tar-
get word, surrounding lemmas, the surrounding
words&apos; parts of speech, proximity to the near-
est phrasal head, and trigram information. A
number of WSD systems were obtained by re-
stricting the number of modules in Preiss&apos; prob-
abilistic modular WSD system, which resulted
in systems with varying performance. The ac-
curacy of the WSD system was found on the En-
glish all words task of SENSEVAL-2 (Palmer et
al., 2002). A correlation of p = 0.97 was found
between the two sets of results, showing a very
high correlation between WSD system perfor-
mance and the performance of SCF acquisition
when the WSD system is employed.

We have described the subcategorization frame
acquisition as a method for evaluating WSD
task in SENSEVAL-3. We demonstrate a high
correlation between WSD system performance
and the performance of SCF acquisition, in-
dicating that any ranking obtained using this
method will complement gold standard meth-
ods of system evaluation.

Preiss&apos; probabilistic WSD system is modular, with modules based on frequency of sense from WordNet, part of speech of the target word, surrounding lemmas, the surrounding words&apos; parts of speech, proximity to the nearest phrasal head, and trigram information. A number of WSD systems were obtained by restricting the number of modules in Preiss&apos; probabilistic modular WSD system, which resulted in systems with varying performance. The accuracy of the WSD system was found on the English all words task of SENSEVAL-2 (Palmer et al., 2002). A correlation of p = 0.97 was found between the two sets of results, showing a very high correlation between WSD system performance and the performance of SCF acquisition when the WSD system is employed. 5 Conclusion We have described the subcategorization frame acquisition as a method for evaluating WSD task in SENSEVAL-3. We demonstrate a high correlation between WSD system performance and the performance of SCF acquisition, indicating that any ranking obtained using this method will complement gold standard methods of system evaluation.

We also calculated the similarity between the acquired unfiltered and gold standard SCF distributions using various measures of distributional similarity (see Korhonen and Preiss (2003) for details of these measures). 4 WSD Performance vs Acquired Frames No teams participated in this task in SENSEVAL3, possibly being scared off by having to sense tag around 1000 instances of each of the 29 verbs used. Teams may also have found it easier to annotate the relevant number of instances just for a subset of the verbs. We therefore used a representative WSD system due to Preiss (2004) to investigate the effect of WSD system perfor4For a forced choice system, the chosen sense is given a probability of one and the remaining senses are assigned zero probabilities. 3Note that this does not mean that 1000 sentences for each verb have been manually sense tagged. No manual sense tagging was done in this task, as the performance of the WSD system is judged by the performance of subcategorization acquisition.
