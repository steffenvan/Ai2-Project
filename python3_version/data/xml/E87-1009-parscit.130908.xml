Spanish and the addition of other features.
Languages other than English have received little
attention as far as the application of natural language
processing techniques to text composition is concer-
ned. The present paper describes briefly work under
development aiming at the design of an integrated
environment for the construction and verification of
documents written in Spanish. In a first phase, a
dictionary of Spanish has been implemented, together
with a synonym dictionary. The main features of both
dictionaries will be summarised, and how they are

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907818181818">
In the field of document processing many tools
exist today which allow the user to introduce a text in
storage, format it, and even, for a few languages, verify
the spelling, punctuation and style 11, 2, 3, 41. English
has been for a long time THE Natural Language,
object of a large number of research and development
work in Computational Linguistics. Other languages,
however (Spanish among them), have received little
attention as far as the application of natural language
processing techniques to text composition is concer-
ned.
The present paper describes briefly work under
development aiming at the design of an integrated
environment for the construction and verification of
documents written in Spanish, for which no similar
tools exist at the moment.
In a first phase, a dictionary of Spanish was
implemented. This is a task of multiple interest, a
dictionary being the one of the basic tools for any
application to systems where Natural Language is in-
volved. Thus its development was undertaken with
two guidelines, completeness and generality. At
present, the dictionary is finished in a version
including about 35,000 stems, which, inflected, give
rise to more than 400,000 different words.
Together with this inflected forms lexicon, a
synonym dictionary was also built as a second step in
the text processing system; this dictionary has about
15,000 entries.
In this paper we summarise the main features of
both dictionaries and how they are applied in an
environment for document verification and
composition. Present and planned enhancements will

TIIE INFLECTED FORMS DICTIONARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993447368421053">
The starting point was an analysis of word
frequency performed on different texts previously
selected: press articles, novels, essays, etc. totalling
approximately one million words. A listing of the
whole set of the entries of the Diccionario de la Real
Academia Espanola 151 (l)RAE, Dictionary of the
Spanish Royal Academy, containing the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot;
Spanish language) was studied, and several other
published dictionaries were as well collated 16, 7, 8,
91. The information so obtained was classified and
filtered, taking into account the objective and first set
up application: the corpus had to cover usual written
language, and in this field should account for as much
of the vocabulary as possible.
The dictionary consists of a list of inflected
words, without associated definitions. Every word has
additionally a number of other information: gender,
number, time, person, mode, etc.
In general, words belonging to restricted or
specialised domains (medicine, law, poetry, linguistics,
etc.) are not listed. Neither are colloquial terms,
including rude or slang words. Very specific regional
uses of Spanish have also not been considered (like
Argentina&apos;s &amp;quot;voseo&amp;quot;: tenes, queres), nor the form of
subjunctive future (tuviere, quisiere), restricted today
to legal writings. Many derived forms have also been
excluded, like diminutives, pejoratives, superlatives
(but not the irregulars); as for adverbs finishing in
-mentc, only the most usual ones have been listed.
Information on the lexicon is contained in two
main files: the base forms file, and the inflective
morphemes file, which are described in the following
sections.
Base forms file
It includes the complete list of terms just
described, specifying the base form on which they
inflect. They have pointers referring to the derivative
morphemes file.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.4139855">
Each entry has the following specifications:
1. Functional category, i.e., verb, noun, adjective,
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.70265">
adverb, preposition, conjunction, article,
pronoun, interjection; words with more than one

<bodyText confidence="0.99031024590164">
associated part of speech will have as many
marks as categories.
2. Verbs, very complex because of the large number
of irregularities and difficult classification, are
qualified as transitive, intransitive or auxiliary.
Further slots are foreseen to code their behaviour
in the language and their usage at the surface
level: complements, adverbials, etc. Possible
combinations of verbs and clitic pronouns are
also marked.
3. There are additional marks for hyphenation
points (for later use by a formatter performing
automatic syllable partition), and several other
for foreign and Latin words, geographical terms,
etc.
Inflective morphemes file
It specifies the derivative morphemes used in the
generation of inflected forms starting from the
previous base forms. A list of paradigms has been
built for each category of nouns, adjectives and verbs,
to account for the different models of inflection.
The classification takes into account the
problems arising from the automatic processing of
inflections, i.e., it considers as irregularities some
behaviours not considered as such in the literature, for
example, some purely phonetic cases, like z c before
e, i (e.g. cazar cace), and cases related with diacritic
signs, both dieresis (e.g. avergonzar --â€¢ avergilenzo),
and accents (e.g. joven jovenes, caracter carac-
teres).
Additionally, it is necessary to consider cases of
incomplete inflections (e.g. in adjectives, avizor only
exists in masculine singular, and alisios only in mas-
culine plural; in names, alicates exists only in mascu-
line plural, afueras only in feminine plural). As for
verbs, this kind of irregularity is present in the so-
called defectives (e.g. hover, abolir, pudrir, etc.).
Finally, there are words with more than one
realisation in one of their forms (e.g. varizlvarice, both
correct in feminine singular). In some adjectives, a
similar problem arises depending on their position: if
they come in front of the noun their apocopated form
appears, but not if they come after (e.g. buenlbueno,
mallmalo), and in verbs, in all subjunctive imperfect
forms (e.g. salieralsaliese), and in a few other isolated
cases (e.g. the imperative satisfazIsatisface).
Together with adjectives marked for gender (e.g.
rojo, roja), there are others unmarked (e.g. amable),
and their gender is defined according to the noun they
modify. Among them, some work in fixed and
restricted contexts, and are defined because they only
modify masculine or feminine nouns (e.g. torraz,
avizor).
It must be noted that the large number of
irregularities in the inflection mechanism has obliged
to detail each one of them, as they could not be
included in any of the general models. This means
that many paradigms have been defined which just
comprise a little number of cases. The complete
description of the classification performed has been
the object of previous papers 110, 111.

TI IE SYNONYM DICTIONARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999277653061225">
To build the synonym lexicon, a published
dictionary was used 1121, which had to be modified
due both to the specific needs of computer processing
and to the many typographical errors and inconsis-
tencies found in its contents. This has allowed to
develop a thorough study on synonymy together with
a complete critique of one of the best-known synonym
dictionaries of the Spanish language.
First of all, the coherence of both dictionaries has
been kept, so that words included in the synonym base
are also present in the main lexicon.
The need to keep the semantic consistency in the
dictionary contents was a first objective. It showed the
little rigor with which printed dictionaries are
constructed and allowed for the application of
systematic tests and modifications to our version in
order to keep symmetry, to cater for hyperonymy, to
bind cross-referencing into semantically reasonable
limits, etc. A forthcoming paper will describe the
problems met and the main tasks performed.
Starling from syntactic marks in the inflected
forms dictionary, an entry in the synonym dictionary
will appear as many times as parts of speech it is
assigned. For example, the word circular can be an
adjective (marked as j, meaning &apos;circular&apos;), a feminine
noun (marked as nf, meaning &apos;note&apos;), and a verb
(marked as v, meaning &apos;move&apos;, &apos;circulate&apos;). The
corresponding entries would be:
circular: j
redondo, curvo, curvado.
circular: nf
ordcn, aviso*, notificacion, carta, nota.
circular: v
andar, moverse, transitar*, pasear, deambular;
divulgarsc, propagarsc, expandirse, difundirse.
Additionally, inside a part of speech, synonyms are
grouped according to the different semantic sense or
nuance. Also allowed are cross references (marked
with asterisks * in the file), which link one synonym
to another dictionary entry, thus extending the
information power of the lexicon.
More specific information about the entries can
also be defined by means of the so-called -qualifiers,
which introduce further restrictions on the entry word
for that meaning to apply. For example, the noun
costa means &apos;coast&apos;, but in plural it is also used to
mean specifically &apos;costs&apos;. The verb echar has several
different senses (&apos;throw&apos;, &apos;dismiss&apos;, &apos;emit&apos;, etc.), but its
reflexive form echarse means &apos;lie down&apos;.

DICTIONARY-BASED TEXT COMPOSITION
Spelling verification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987791666667">
The approach is based on the identification of
all strings in the text which are not present in the
dictionary. Verification algorithms isolate each word
(token), look for them in the lexicon and point out to
the user which ones have not been found (by
highlighting them in the screen or using a different
colour). A token is thus every sequence of letters
separated by delimiters (in Spanish: blank, comma,
period, colon, semicolon, hyphen, open and close
question and exclamation marks). The size of the
dictionary will have several obvious implications: the
frequency of correct words that will be rejected, the
search time, the amount of storage allocated. A
compromise among all these factors and the use of
several compaction mechanisms have allowed its size
to remain between reasonable limits.
The spelling verification performed at this
moment considers each word in the text independently
of the rest.
An additional and interesting possibility of the
program is that it allows the user to define his/her own
dictionary of addenda, where terms not known by the
system (proper names, technical or specific words) can
be stored.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.892669">
Spelling correction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955">
Apart from detecting incorrect terms in the text,
the program can also propose for each wrong token
a list of candidates, words very similar to the token
but which are included in the dictionary. This list is
presented with the alternative terms sorted in
decreasing priority order, depending on the value of
a similarity index computed for each word. This
-similarity is determined by an algorithm, and
essentially depends on the number of alterations that
must be performed on the token to obtain the correct
word. Thus it is a function of the relative difference
in length between the token and the word, the
difference in the character sequence due to any of the
most typical error sources (transcription, omission,
insertion, substitution), the matching of the last letter,
etc.
The user can choose a word in the proposed list,
and the system will automatically replace the wrong
term with the selected one.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.574925">
Morphology function
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999625222222222">
For each word in the text the program is able to
produce all its possible base forms and parts of speech
(out of context at this first stage). It can also generate
the complete set of derived forms for each of those
possibilities. This is most interesting in Spanish in the
case of unusual inflections, like many irregular and
defective verbs, when in doubt about the use of
accents, with some special nouns and adjectives, with
seldom used terms, etc.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.7111">
Synonym function
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994464285714">
The mechanism is very similar to the one
described for alternative terms: when the user asks for
synonyms of a given word in the text these are
displayed in a window. At present, words with several
parts of speech having specific synonyms for each of
them get a multiple display of synonyms for all those
parts. For example, synonyms to the word bajo will
be presented in several lists: as a verb (present tense
of bajar: &apos;get down&apos;), as a noun (&apos;ground floor), as
an adjective (&apos;low&apos;), as an adverb (&apos;down&apos;), and as a
preposition (&apos;under&apos;). This is, of course, an extreme
case, but there are many similar examples.
The user may choose one of the synonyms and
automatically replace for it the word in the text. In
this first phase, the synonym function does not inflect
the candidates in the form of the original token.
Starting from it, it performs a morphological analysis,
finds its stem and looks for the synonyms in the
corresponding dictionary. Thus, if the user writes
Juan quiere a Maria (&apos;John loves Mary&apos;) and requests
synonyms for quiere, the system will find the base form
querer (&apos;to love&apos;), and will display, for example, the
infinitive amar, but not ama, which is the
corresponding inflected form (third person singular
indicative present) of the original verb. Similarly,
when asking for synonyms of nitias (&apos;girls&apos;), it will give
the list of synonyms for nitio (&apos;boy&apos;), which is its base
form according to the defined paradigms.

PARSING ANI) (MIER ENHANCEMENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999683">
A dictionary-based text composition facility is of
a great help when writing documents, but it is clearly
not enough. Our next objective is to implement a
parser of Spanish and to integrate it, as a first
application, into the existing system. This will have
several consequences in the enhancement of its present
capabilities and will add new possibilities of
verification.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993935">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.90171120754717">
For example, it will allow the processing of
multiple-word phrases, compounds and adverbials.
It will make possible for the synonym feature to only
propose alternatives for a word in the suitable part of
speech and exclude all other possibilities according to
the context.
It will also allow to overcome some of the
limitations of spelling verification as performed now,
by taking into account the context; thus, errors due to
the use of correct words (i.e., included in the
dictionary) in a wrong syntactic environment, will be
detected in most cases. The main causes of
confusability now unnoticed that will be highlighted
are due to three different types of ambiguity:
â€¢ Graphical ambiguity: homophone words with a
graphic difference in the accent and with different
parts of speech (E.g. relative vs. interrogative
pronoun: cuantolcucinto, preposition vs. verb:
de/de, conditional vs. affirmative conjunction:
si/si, etc.).
â€¢ Accentuation ambiguities: based upon the accent
change inside a group of words, sometimes with
a different part of speech associated (E.g. verb
vs. noun: bailelbaile, verb-noun-adjective vs.
verb: friolfrio, noun vs. verb vs. verb:
cantaralcantaralcantarci, verb vs. verb:
amelame, etc.).
â€¢ Phonetic ambiguities: implied by orthographic
problems based on Spanish phonetics
(E.g.astalhasta, tuboltuvo, are phonetically
ambiguous; calladolcayado, contextolcontesto
also in some regions).
Naturally this would only be the most immediate
application of the parser, and it must be noted that
some of the described ambiguities will need a great
deal of semantic knowledge to be resolved; this we are
not considering for the moment. Other obvious uses
include the detection of agreement errors: inside
Noun Phrases (in Spanish its elements must agree in
gender and number), between the subject and the verb
of a sentence, errors in the use of pronouns (typical
misuses are the so-called leismo&amp;quot; and laismo&amp;quot;),
errors in the order of clitic pronouns, etc.
The different elements integrating the system
constitute a set of different pieces whose application is
of course not bound to document composition: seve-
ral other objectives are also foreseen for the
dictionaries and the parser, a computer-assisted verb
conjugation system has already been built for Spanish
grammar students, and other ideas include automatic
document abstracting, storage and retrieval, inclusion
of dictionary definitions and translation into other
languages, and document style critiquing.
