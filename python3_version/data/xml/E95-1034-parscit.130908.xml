Multiset-CCG is a combinatory catego-
rial formalism that can capture the syn-
tax and interpretation of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word or-
der in languages such as Turkish. The
formalism compositionally derives the
predicate-argument structure and the in-
formation structure (e.g. topic, focus)
of a sentence, and uniformly handles
word order variation among arguments
and adjuncts within a clause, as well
as in complex clauses and across clause
boundaries.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999937627118644">
In this paper, I present a categorial formalism,
Multiset CCG (based on Combinatory Categorial
Grammars (Steedman, 1985; Steedman, 1991)),
that captures the syntax and context-dependent
interpretation of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order in languages
such as Turkish. Word order variation in rela-
tively free word order languages, such as Czech,
Finnish, German, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, is
used to convey distinctions in meaning that go
beyond traditional propositional semantics. The
word order in these languages serves to structure
the information being conveyed to the hearer, e.g.
by indicating what is the topic and the focus of the
sentence (as will be defined in the next section). In
fixed word order languages such as English, these
are indicated largely through intonation and stress
rather than word order.
The context-appropriate use of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word or-
der is of considerable importance in developing
practical applications in natural language gener-
ation, machine translation, and machine-assisted
translation. I have implemented a database query
system in Prolog, described in (Hoffman, 1994),
which uses Multiset CCG to interpret and gen-
erate Turkish sentences with context-appropriate
word orders. Here, I concentrate on further devel-
oping the formalism, especially to handle complex
sentences.
There have been other formalisms that inte-
grate information structure into the grammar for
&amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order languages, e.g. (Sgall et al,
1986; Engdahl/Vallduvi, 1994; Steinberger, 1994).
However, I believe my approach is the first to
tackle complex sentences with embedded infor-
mation structures and discontinuous constituents.
Multiset CCG can handle free word order among
arguments and adjuncts in all clauses, as well
as word order variation across clause boundaries,
i.e. long distance scrambling. The advantage
of using a combinatory categorial formalism is
that it provides a compositional and flexible sur-
face structure, which allows syntactic constituents
to easily correspond with information structure
units. A novel characteristic of this approach
is that the context-appropriate use of word or-
der is captured by compositionally building the
predicate-argument structure (AS) and the infor-
mation structure (IS) of a sentence in parallel.
After presenting the motivating Turkish data
in Section 2, I present a competence grammar for
Turkish in Section 3 that captures the basic syn-
tactic and semantic relationships between predi-
cates and their arguments or adjuncts while al-
lowing &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order. This grammar, which
derives the predicate-argument structure is then
integrated with the information structure in Sec-
tion 4. In Section 5, the formalism is extended to
account for complex sentences and long distance
scrambling.

The arguments of a verb in Turkish (as well
as many other &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order languages) do
not have to occur in a fixed word order. For
instance, all six permutations of the transitive
sentence below are possible, since case-marking,
rather than word order, serves to differentiate the
arguments.1

Although all the permutations have the same
propositional interpretation, see(Fatma,Ahme0,
each word order conveys a different discourse
meaning only appropriate to a specific dis-
course situation. We can generally associate the
sentence-initial position with the topic, the im-
mediately preverbal position with the focus which
receives the primary stress in the sentence, and
postverbal positions with backgrounded informa-
tion (Erguvanli, 1984). The post-verbal positions
are influenced by the given/new status of enti-
ties within the discourse; postverbal elements are
always evoked discourse entities or are inferrable
from entities already evoked in the previous dis-
course, and thus, help to ground the sentence in
the current context.
I define topic and focus according to their infor-
mational status. A sentence can be divided into a
topic and a comment, where the topic is the main
element that the sentence is about, and the com-
ment is the main information we want to convey
about this topic. Assuming the hearer&apos;s discourse
model or knowledge store is organized by topics,
the sentence topic can be seen as specifying an
&amp;quot;address&amp;quot; in the hearer&apos;s knowledge store (Rein-
hart, 1982; Vallduvi, 1990). The informational
focus is the most information-bearing constituent
in the sentence, (Vallduvi, 1990); it is the new
or important information in the sentence (within
the comment), and receives prosodic prominence
in speech. These information structure compo-
nents are successful in describing the context-
appropriate answer to database queries. In this
domain, the focus is the new or important part of
the answer to a wh-question, while the topic is the
main entity that the question and answer are both
about, that can be paraphrased using the clause
&amp;quot;As for X&amp;quot;. In other domains, finding the topic
and focus of sentences according to the context
may be more complicated.
We can now explain why certain word orders
are appropriate or inappropriate in a certain con-
text, in this case database queries. For example, a
speaker may use the SOV order in (2b) to answer
the wh-question in (2a) because the speaker wants
to focus the new object, Ahmet, and so places it
in the immediately preverbal position. However,
given a different wh-question in (3), the subject,
(and their vowel-harmony variants) which attach to
the noun; nominative case and subject-verb agreement
for third person singular are unmarked.
Fatma, is the focus of the answer, while Ahmet is
the topic, a link to the previous context, and thus
the OSV word order is used.2

Clausal arguments, just like simple NP argu-
ments, can occur anywhere in the matrix sentence
as long as they are case-marked, (5)a and b. Sub-
ordinate verbs in Turkish resemble gerunds in En-
glish; they take a genitive marked subject and are
case-marked like NPs, but they assign structural
case to the rest of their arguments like verbs. The
arguments and adjuncts within most embedded
clause can occur in any word order, also seen in
(5)a and b. In addition, elements from the embed-
ded clause can occur in matrix clause positions,
i.e. long distance scrambling, (5c). As indicated
by the translations, word order variation in com-
plex sentences also affects the interpretation.

The information structure (IS) is distinct from
predicate-argument structure (AS) in languages
such as Turkish because adjuncts and elements
long distance scrambled from embedded clauses
can take part in the IS of the matrix sentence with-
out taking part in the AS of the matrix sentence.
As motivated from the data, a formalism for
&amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order languages such as Turkish must
be flexible enough to handle word order varia-
tion among the arguments and the adjuncts in all
clauses, as well as the long distance scrambling
of elements from embedded clauses. In addition,
to capture the context-appropriate use of word
order, the formalism must associate information
structure components such as topic and focus with
the appropriate sentence positions, regardless of
the predicate-argument structure of the sentence,
and be able to handle the information structure
of complex sentences. In the next sections I will
present a combinatory categorial formalism which
can handle these characteristics of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word or-
der languages.

3 &amp;quot;Free&amp;quot; Word Order Syntax
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9965135">
In Multiset-CCG3, we capture the syntax of free.
argument order within a clause by relaxing the
subcategorization requirements of a verb so that
it does not specify the linear order of its argu-
ments. Each verb is assigned a function category
in the lexicon which subcategorizes for a multi-
set of arguments, without linear order restrictions.
For instance, a transitive verb has the category
SI{Nn,Na}, a function looking for a set of ar-
guments, a nominative case noun phrase (Nn) and
an accusative case noun phrase (Na), and result-
ing in the category S, a complete sentence, once
it has found these arguments in any order.
The syntactic category for verbs provides no hi-
erarchical or precedence information. However, it
is associated with a propositional interpretation
that does express the hierarchical ranking of the
arguments. For example, the verb &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; is as-
signed the lexical category S : see(X,Y)1{Nn
X, Na : Y}, and the noun &amp;quot;Fatma&amp;quot; is assigned
Nn : Fatma, where the semantic interpretation
is separated from the syntactic representation by
a colon. These categories are a shorthand for-the
many syntactic and semantic features associated
with each lexical item. The verbal functions can
also specify a direction feature for each of their ar-
guments, notated in the rules as an arrow above
the argument. Thus, verb-final languages such as
Korean can be modeled by using this direction
feature in verbal categories, e.g. Sj{Nn, Na}.
Multiset-CCG contains a small set of rules that
combine these categories into larger constituents.
The following application rules allow a function

such as a verbal category to combine with one of
its arguments to its right (&gt;) or left (&lt;). We
assume that a category X10 where there are no
arguments left in the multiset rewrites by a clean-
up rule to just X.

Through the use of the composition rules,
Multiset-CCGs can handle the free word order

4 The Discourse Meaning of
&amp;quot;Free&amp;quot; Word Order
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975714411764706">
Word order variation in Turkish and other &amp;quot;free&amp;quot;
word order languages is used to express the infor-
mation structure of a sentence. The grammar pre-
sented in the last section determines the predicate-
argument structure of a sentence, regardless of
word order. In this section, I add the ordering
component of the grammar where the informa-
tion structure of a sentence is determined. The
simple compositional interface described below al-
lows the AS and the IS of a sentence to be derived
in parallel. This interface is very similar to Steed-
man&apos;s approach in integrating prosody and syntax
in CCGs for English (Steedman, 1991).
A. Each Multiset-CCG category encoding syn-
tactic and semantic properties in the AS is
associated with an Ordering Category which
encodes the ordering of IS components.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.907922222222222">
B. Two constituents can combine if and only if
i. their syntactic/semantic categories can
combine using the Multiset-CCG appli-
cation and composition rules,
ii. and their Ordering Categories can com-
bine using the rules below:
Simple Forward Application (&gt;):
X/Y Y X.
Simple Backward Application (&lt;):

<equation confidence="0.892292">
Y X \Y X.
Identity (=--): X X X
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999493083333333">
Every verbal category in Multiset-CCG is asso-
ciated with an ordering category, which serves as
a template for the IS. The ordering category in (9)
is a function that specifies the components which
must be found to complete a possible IS. The for-
ward and backward slashes in the category indi-
cate the direction in which the arguments must be
found, and the parentheses around arguments in-
dicate optionality. The variables T,F,G1,G2 will
be unified with the interpretations of the proper
constituents in the sentence during the deriva-
tion.

<bodyText confidence="0.954974714285714">
The function above can use the simple application
rules to first combine with a focused constituent
on its left, then a ground constituent on its left,
then a topic constituent on its left, and a ground
constituent on its right. This function will result
in a complete IS only if it finds the obligatory
sentence-initial topic and the immediately prever-
bal focus constituent; its other arguments (the
ground) are optional and can be skipped during
the derivation through a category rewriting rule,
)(KY) X, that may apply after the applica-
tion rules.5
Nonverbal elements are associated with simpler
ordering categories, often just a variable which
can unify with the topic, focus, or any other com-
ponent in the IS template during the derivation.
The identity rule allows two constituents with the
same discourse function (often variables) to com-
bine. These simpler ordering categories also con-
tain a feature which indicates whether they rep-
resent given or new information in the discourse
model, which is dynamically checked during the
derivation. Restrictions (such that elements to the
right of the verb have to be discourse-old informa-
tion in Turkish) are expressed as features on the
arguments of the verbal ordering functions.
What is novel about this formalism is that the
predicate-argument structure and the information
structure of a sentence are built in parallel in a
compositional way. For example, given the fol-
lowing question, we may answer in a word order
which indicates that &amp;quot;today&amp;quot; is the topic of the
sentence, and &amp;quot;Little Ahmet&amp;quot; is the focus. The
derivation for this answer is seen in Figure 1.
(10) a. Bugiin kimi gOrecek Fatma?
Today who-Acc see-Fut Fatma?
&amp;quot;As for today, who will Fatma see?&amp;quot;
b.
Bugiin kiiciik Ahmet&apos;i gorecek Fatma.
Today little Ahmet-Acc see-Fut Fatma.
&amp;quot;Today, she, Fatma, will see Little AHMET.&amp;quot;
In Figure 1, every word in the sentence is associ-
ated with a lexical category right below it, which is
then associated with an ordering category in the
next line. Parallel lines indicate the application
of rules to combine two constituents together; the
first line is for combining the syntactic categories,
and the second line is for combining the ordering
categories of the two constituents. The syntac-
tic constituents are allowed to combine to form a
larger constituent, only if their pragmatic coun-
terparts (the ordering categories) can also com-
bine. Thus, the derivation reflects the single sur-
face structure for the sentence, while composition-
ally building the AS and the IS of the sentence in
5 Another IS is available where the topic component
is marked as &amp;quot;inferrable&amp;quot;, for those cases where the
topic is a zero pronoun instead of an element which is
realized in the sentence. After the derivation is com-
plete, further discourse processing infers the identity
of the unrealized topic from among the salient entities
in the discourse model.

Using this formalism, I have implemented
a database query system (Hoffman, 1994)
which generates Turkish sentences with context-
appropriate word orders, in answer to database
queries. In generation, the same topic found
in the database query is maintained in the an-
swer. For wh-questions, the information that is
retrieved from the database to answer the ques-
tion becomes the focus of the answer. I have ex-
tended the system to also handle yes-no questions
involving the question morpheme &amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;, which is
placed next to whatever element is being ques-
tioned in the sentence. If the verb is being ques-
tioned, this is a cue that the assertion or nega-
tion of the verb will be the focus of the answer:

In most Turkish sentences, the immediately pre-
verbal position is prosodically prominent, and this
corresponds with the informational focus. How-
ever, verbs can be focused in Turkish by placing
the primary stress of the sentence on the verb in-
stead of immediately preverbal position and by
lexical cues such as the placement of the question
morpheme. Thus, we must have more than one
IS available for verbs, where verbs can be in the
focus or the ground component of the IS. In ad-
dition, it is possible to focus the whole VP or the
whole sentence, which can be determined by the
context, in this case the database query:

<bodyText confidence="0.998867785714286">
In yes/no questions, if a non-verbal element is
being focused by the question morpheme and the
answer is no, the system provides a more natu-
ral and helpful answer by replacing the focus of
the question with a variable and searching the
database for an alternate entity that satisfies the
rest of the question.
Thus, Multiset CCG allows certain pragmatic
distinctions to influence the syntactic construction
of the sentence using a lexicalized compositional
method. In addition, it provides a uniform ap-
proach to handle word order variation among ar-
guments and adjuncts, and as we will see in the
next section, across clause boundaries.

verbs, just like matrix verbs, are associated with
an ordering category which determines the infor-
mation structure for the clause. When the sub-
ordinate clause syntactically combines with the
matrix clause, the IS of the subordinate clause
is embedded into the IS of the matrix clause. For
example, in the complex sentence and its IS be-
low, the embedded clause is the topic of the matrix
clause since it occurs in the sentence-initial posi-
tion of the matrix clause. The word order vari-
ation within the embedded clause indicates the
structure of the IS that is embedded under topic.
Multiset-CCG can recover the appropriate
predicate-argument relations of the embedded
clause and the matrix clause even when the ar-
guments occur out of the domain of the subordi-
nate verb. The composition rules allow two verb
categories with multisets of arguments to combine
together. As the two verbs combine, their argu-
ments collapse into one argument set in the syn-
tactic representation. As seen in the derivation
below, we compose the verbs together to form a
complex verbal function, which can then apply to
the arguments of both verbs in any order.

To ensure that the embedded JS is complete be-
fore it is placed into the matrix clause&apos;s IS, we re-
strict the application rules (e.g. X/Y Y = X)
in the ordering component of Multiset-CCG; we
stipulate that the argument Y must not be a func-
tion (with arguments left to find). The restriction
ensures that the ordering category for the embed-
ded verb is no longer a function, that it has found
all of its obligatory components and skipped all
the optional ones before combining with the ma-

5.2 Long Distance Scrambling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9379249375">
In Turkish complex sentences with clausal ar-
guments, elements of the embedded clauses can
occur in matrix clause positions, i.e. long dis-
tance scrambling. However, speakers only use
long distance scrambling for specific pragmatic
functions. Generally, an element from the em-
bedded clause can occur in the sentence initial
topic position of the matrix clause (e.g. (15)b) or
to the right of the matrix verb as backgrounded
information (e.g. (15)d), but cannot occur in
the stressed immediately preverbal position (e.g.
(15)c). This long distance dependency is sim-
ilar to the English topicalization construction.
c. *Aye [thin gittigini] FATMA&apos;nin biliyor.
*Aye [yest. go-Ger-Acc] Fatma-Gen knows.
d. Aye [dun gittigini] biliyor Fatma&apos;nin.
Aye [yest. go-Ger-Acc] knows Fatma-Gen.

Although the verbs&apos; argument sets are collapsed
into one set, their respective arguments are still
distinct within the semantic representation of the
_sentence. The propositional interpretation of the
subordinate clause is embedded into the interpre-
tation of the matrix clause.
The syntactic component of Multiset-CCGs
correctly rules out long distance scrambling to the
immediately preverbal matrix position, because
elements from the embedded clause cannot com-
bine with the matrix verb before the matrix verb
has combined with the embedded verb.

Long distance scrambling to the sentence initial
position and post-verbal position in the matrix
clause is handled through the composition of the
verbs, as seen in Figure 2.
The ordering component of Multiset CCG al-
lows individual elements from subordinate clauses
to be components in the IS of the matrix clause.
This is because the ordering category for a ma-
trix verb does not specify that its components be
arguments in its AS. In the sentence in Figure 2,
&amp;quot;Fatma&amp;quot;, an argument of the embedded clause,
has been scrambled into the topic position of the
matrix clause. The derivation with both compo-
nents of the grammar working in parallel is shown
in Figure 2. The embedded verb must first com-
plete its IS (/S2); then, the two verbs compose to-
gether, and the subordinate IS is embedded into
the matrix IS (IS). The complex verbal con-
stituent can then combine with the rest of the
arguments of both verbs in any order. The lin-
ear order of the two NP arguments will determine
which components of the matrix IS each fill. Note
that &amp;quot;Fatma&amp;quot; is an argument in the interpretation
of the embedded verb &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;, not the matrix verb
&amp;quot;know&amp;quot;, but it plays the role of topic in the matrix

5.3 Islands
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999748972972973">
The syntactic component of Multiset-CCGs can
derive a string of any number of scram-
bled NPs followed by a string of verbs:
(NP1...NPra)scrambled V m Vi, where each verb,
subcategorizes for NP. The more one scram-
bles things, the harder the sentence is to process,
but there is no clear cut-off point in which the
scrambled sentences become ungrammatical for
native speakers. Thus, I claim that processing
limitations and pragmatic purposes, rather than
syntactic competence, restrict such scrambling.
However, in some &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order languages,
some clauses act as islands that strictly do not al-
low long distance scrambling. However, in some
other &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order languages, such as Turk-
ish, it is very hard to find island effects. As seen
in the first example in Figure 3, even elements
from relative clauses can be extracted. However,
it is harder to extract elements from some adjunct
clauses which do not have close semantic links to
the matrix clause. To account for clauses exhibit-
ing island behaviour, we can assign the head of
the clause a category such as SISI{Nn, Na} which
makes certain that the head combines with all of
its NP arguments before combining with the ma-
trix clause, S. As demonstrated in (19)c in Fig-
ure 3, long distance scrambling out of such an ad-
junct clause is thus prohibited.
In contrast, heads of adjunct clauses which
are not islands are assigned categories such as
SI{S, Nn, Na}. Since this category can combine
with the matrix verb even before it has combined
with all of its arguments, it allows long distance
scrambling of its arguments. This lexical control
of the behaviour is very advantageous for captur-
ing Turkish, since not every adjunct clause is an
island in Turkish. However, further research is

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966777777778">
I have presented a combinatory.categorial formal-
ism that can account for both the syntax and in-
terpretation of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; word order in Turkish. The
syntactic component of Multiset CCG is flexible
enough to derive the predicate-argument structure
of simple and complex sentences without relying
on word order, and it is expressive enough to cap-
ture syntactic restrictions on word order in dif-
ferent languages such as languages with NP or
clausal islands or languages which allow discon-
tinuous NPs or clauses. Word order is used in
the ordering component of Multiset CCG to de-
termine the information structure of a sentence.
Every Multiset CCG category encoding syntac-
tic and semantic properties is associated with an
ordering category which encodes the ordering of
information structure components such as topic
and focus; two syntactic/semantic categories are
allowed to combine to form a larger constituent
only if their ordering categories can also combine.
The formalism has been implemented within a
database query task in Quintus Prolog, to inter-
pret and generate simple and complex sentences
with context-appropriate word orders.
Multiset CCG captures the context-appropriate
use of word order by compositionally deriving the
predicate-argument structure and the information
structure of a sentence in parallel. It allows ad-
juncts and elements from embedded clauses to
take part in the information structure of the ma-
trix clause, even though they do not take part in
its predicate-argument structure. Thus, this for-
malism provides a uniform approach in capturing
the syntactic and pragmatic aspects of word or-
der variation among arguments and adjuncts, and
across clause boundaries.
