Journal of Computational Linguistics in four packs
per calendar year, promptly at intervals of three
months. Each pack is to contain two numbers of
the Finite String. The difficulties of the first
year of publication of AJCL are responsible for
the delayed, production of this pack ,which also
contains Volume 11, Number 4 of TFS. IL would be
a rash editor indeed who guaranteed promptness

The announcement aad program appear on Card 25. The fol-
lowing account is presented as a statement Of the needs and
condition of the field; it was prepared by BNW and RS.
The workshop is to promote interaction among researchers in
computational linguistics, psychology, linguistics, and artificial
intelligence. The primary purpose of the workshop is to explore
two major areas of common research, memory and knowledge, both
with respect to their relation to human language behavior. Spe-
cifically, we hope to consider such questions as
(1.4 What computational models and mechanisms have been
proposed up to now in these areas?
(2) What aspects of human language behavior are they
meant to account for?
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.764091">
(3) Are these models and mechanisms compatible?
(4) Is there a single global view of language understanding
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.949457875">
and use that is adequately modelled by some combination
of them?
THEORETICAL ISSUES 5
(5) Are there still. significant aspects of human lan-
guage use which they cannot account for?
(6) What is the best model of human language use that
can be assembled out of the concepts that nave been
developed in computational linguistics, linguistics,
psychology, and artificial intelligence?
(7) How well does it really approximate what humans do
with language?
(8) With respect to gaps in the model, is thete any-
thing currently in the wind .adequate to t:omplete
them?
Thus our primary purpose is both to provide an assessment of our
Knowledge and goals in this area with respect to language pro-
cessing and to provide a cross-disciplinary tutorial for the par-
ticipants.. A secondary purpose of the workshop is to discuss the
important issue of valid methodology in such research.
In eight seSsions, speakers will address the audience on
points made by themselves or others in position papers previously
distributed to all participants. After these presentations are
finished, speakers and audience will take part in general dis-
cussions.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973302636363636">
In recent years, researchers in several disciplines have been
converging on the problem of language understanding and memory as
providing a handle on the problems in their own fields. Research-
ers in Artificial Intelligence, concerned with building models of
intelligent behavior, havekstarted to develop and study models of
conversational interaction, which naturally rely on models of
language understanding. This is often done without reference to
th work of resea±chers in other disciplines.
Linguistics, of course, has always been concerned with lan-
guage, but frequently at no level higher than that of the sen-
tence. Such theories as derived from the consideration of single

THEORETICAL ISSUES 6
sentences out of context are difficult to apply to the task of
understanding. Recently.some linguists such as Chafe have
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.994568287128713">
shifted their emphasis towards understanding and modelling dis-
course, which is of direct relevance to questiofts of understand-
ing.
Psychologists have also been interested in problems of lan-
guage understanding and memory. While early research did look to
lthguistics to p-ovide plausible theories of human language be-
havior the then-current theories proved insufficient to the task.
As a result, some psychologists have begun to create theil own
theories, while others have begun to pay attehtion to the wark of
Al researchers. Computer models are now appearing which are ex-.
plications of these theories&apos;.
In the field of computational linguistics, the challenge of
building computer systems which can carry on fluent and helpful
dialogues with a user has Also shifted the emphasis in the field
from more efficient parsers to more capable understanders,
In spite of this convergence of many different disciplines
on the same problem, there is sgrprisingly little communication
between researchers in the different fields, apart from occasion-
al discovery of relevant papers in one field by members of an-
other. Without conferenges of the sort that we are proposing,
there is. no opportunity for the individual researchers in these
different fields to talk to each other directly. The value of
such face-to-face confrontation and the opportunity for asking
questions and exploring tme applicability of techniques in areas
other than the ones that the author had in mind are well appre-
ciated. Within disciplines syuch opportunities exist in tradi-
tional professional conferences. Our conference will provide an
opportunity for such interaction across a diversity of fields
which would not otherwise be possible.
THEORETICAL ISSUES 7
The need for such a conference is especially great in the
area of natural language understanding. The many different fields
which are beginning to give otrong attention to this problem all
have different interests and consequently different emphases on
the problem. Researchers in a particular field tend to focus
only on their own interests and ignore other aspects of the prob-
lem. For example, the classical transformational grammar theory
has largely ignored the necessity for the theory to account for
psycholinguistic and other performance aspects of language. This
is a reasonable way to gain a restricted research problem, but the
result of such research may suffer if the researcher does not have
some general idea of the problems associated with the aspects that
are being ignored. This conference will attempt to provide speci-
alists in different fields with this type of general understanding
of the problems of concern in other fields. We feel that this ex-
posure to different aspects and eMphases will have a very benefi-
cial effect on all fields of natural language research, and that
without such&apos; interchange the potential for much of that research
will not be realized.
The opportunity for Such a meeting as we are preparing does
not currently exist elsewhere. Conferences sponsored by profes-
sional societies invariabl:y present intradasciplinary views rather
than interdisciplinary ones, and past intrdisciplinary workshops
have always been on a very small scale. For example, at the NSF
sposored workshop in Woods Bole, Massachusetts, in 1971, some 25
researchers interested in Computational Semantics were brought
together for two weeks of worthwhile talks. While the results of
such a conference are largely intangible, a number of participants
in that conference have attested to the impact of that conference
on their way of thinking about problems and the course-of theit
research. We plan to adhere to the model of the Woods Hole col-
ference, but with the following two changes.
THEORETICAL ISSUES 8
First it is important to create) the possibility fot the
many new researchers from different fields who have entered this
area to gain an appreciation of the different emphasds of other
fields. Secondly, it is important that a much larger number of
people whose interests are .in one dis\cioline or another be ex-
posed to the ideas emerging from the synthesis of these disci-
plines. Et is important that more than just a small group be
able to exchange ideas.
Since a long workshop would be very difficult on the scale
we are proposing, we are relying on an early circulation of posi-
tion papers to familiarize all participants, speakers and audi-
ence alike, with the current ideas. on natural language understand-
ing in each of the fields. These preprints will also serve the
valuable job of informing those unable to participate in the work-
shop of these current ideas, and de therefore intend to make copies
of the preprints widely available.
ORGANIZATION
The two sessions of each day will be held in the morning, and
in the late afternoon. The long break fort lunch in between will
facilitate discussions oi the morning&apos;s topic, without the need to
get back to another session immediately.
All sessions will be open to the public, and we expect about
150 people to participate. MIT was selected as a site so that
the widest group of interested people might be able to come at a
reasonable cost. MIT has made a large air-conditioned lecture
room available, and will also provide low-cost dormitory housing
for the participants.
rhe sessions will-not simply be introdUctions to working
systems or well-known theoldes. Position papers will have been
distributed to all participants at least a month in adVance of
THEORETICAL ISSUES 9
the workshop to familiarize them with the ideas of each speaker.
The sessions will consist of short presentations (20-15 minutes)
by the speakers outlining their already circulated ideas. Fol-
lowing a break, each speaker will have the opportunity to respond
to earlier remarks, after which discussion will be opened to the
audience. A session chairman will bb responsible for maintaining
the level and direction of the sessiOh.

A RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGE APPROACH TO HIGH QUALITY TRANSLATION

<bodyText confidence="0.999899210526316">
This paper deals with an approach to the problems of automa-
tic high quality translation and, more generally, of automatic
language data processing, based on the restriction of the input
of MT and other systems to A certain type of sublanguaqe. The
approach was proposed by the present author in the framework of a
general theory of sublanguages (see Raskin, 1971) And subsequent-
ly tested and used by his own and other groups of researchers in
the USSR on tie, material of diverse restricted sublanguages (see
ibid; Gorodeckij and Raskin, 1971, &apos;t.1). The paper consists of
two parts. Part 1 contains a very brief exposition c the basic
principle&apos;s of the approach. In Part 2 some aavantages of the
approach over other (unspecified) approaches unrestricted in this
way are mentioned in the context of a few important problems of
high quality translation. Since these problems were also dis-
cussed by the contribUtors to Feasibility Study on Fully Automa-
tic High Quality Translation., at certain points of Part 2 the
paper enters a dialogue of &apos;a sort with some of them (all the quo-
tations and references followed by a name only are taken from. the
contribution by the corresponding author to the said report).

11 SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGE APPROACH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99070216">
It might be observed that in most cases when the practical
need of construbting an MT system arises, its input, i.e. the
linguistic material which is to be subjected to such treatment,
is highly restricted 1.2y certain conditions: it is usually a rela-
tively narrow field of science or technology with texts which are
relatively, homogeneous, with a limited vocabulary, a restricted
set of yntactic constructions, a highly structured substance of
the content plane, and a relatiVely constant system of values for
all the re.levant oragmatic parameters which are.determined in
this case not by the individual properties of any -particular sit-
uation of communication, as is usually the case in casual communi-
cation, but rather by the position of che field itself among the
contiguous fields as well as in nor„-linguistic reality, in general.
For such restricted sublanguages a simple algorithm of autom&apos;atic
processing was constructed and proved to be highly efficient in
its practical applications.
The algorithm is based on an over-important property which
follows, logically and practically, from the features which charac-
terize the class of restricted sublanguaaes in the theory of sub-
languages, including those Which were emphasized above and which
result in the irrelevdnce of all surface structure distinctions
among sentences with identical deep structure or the exact syno-
nymity of all paraphrases (and, in fact, even near-paraphrases),
This prol3erty implies that each stem in the. vocabulary bf a re-
stricted subiancuare tends to play certain permanent role in

all the gituations described by those Sentences where the stem

these roles, which are given the status oi serantic characteris-
tics of stems, is compiled (usually it does not ekceed 15 items)
and each dictidnary entry is assigned a certain characteristic.
Then a scheme of the maximally extended sentence of the restric-
ted sublanguage, a maximal deep structure of a sort, is postulated
in, such a way that each sentence (or rather, cad) clause) can be
represented as a (partial) realization of this structure. Such
structures can embed, nest in, etc., each other. The dictionary
of the restricted sublanguage with all its entries being assigned
semantic characteristics and the schere of the mnximall extended
sentence of the restricted sublanguace are the two instruments on
which, the universal-algorithm is founded. Texts of the restricted
salanquage constitute its input, the cutput being a sequence of
(partially) filled, ordered and subordinate d sch&amp;les/deep struc-
tures. By making the serantic characteristic assigned to each
ser&apos; of the restricted sublanguaae, rore or less detailed, one rav
cdntrol the depth of semantic analysis. With its sualgorithms of
&amp;quot;ellipsis analysis&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;homogeneous parts analysis&apos;, &amp;quot;boundar- anal-
ysis&amp;quot;, the algorithm o2erates as a uhiversal Turinc rachine in the
sense, that having been fed the aniversally standardized inforra-
t/on on a particular restricted suhlanguage, it proceeds to an61yze
it in the universal way and is equally applicable to each and every
restricted language.
RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES. 31
Is Restricted Sublangudge Approach, RSA, applicable to all,
or at least most relevant cases or can it be applied only in a
few exceptional situations?. It has been argued elsewhere (see
Raskin, 1971; Ch.4.1) that the first alternative holds true while
in the cases in which a polythematic informational system is needed
it seems worthwhile to treat the processed texts as belonging to
se&apos;veral distinct restricted sublanguages; and after distinguish-
ing them with the help of a not too complicated device, to make
use of the technique developed for restricted sublanguages.

Semantics and pr-agmatics-alld the quality of translation.
Recent developments in semailtic and syntactic theory have demon-
strated the practically indefinite potential depth of a complete
linguistic description which seems to require much scarcely acces-.
sible (at present, if not in_principle) information on &amp;quot;speech act
conditions, conversation rules, and semantic interpretation which
must be associated in an idiosyncratic way with the lexical item
in question&amp;quot;, op theory of illocutionary acts&amp;quot;, on &amp;quot;a theory
of diacourse which relates the use of sentences in social and con-
versational situations&amp;quot;, and.on &amp;quot;a theory of natural logic&amp;quot;
(Fillmore), while the pragmatic dimension of the text is said to
include answers to such heterogeneous questions as &amp;quot;by whom the
text was produced, for which kind of audience it was meant, which
kind of background knowledge the producer of the text assumed to be
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.456842">

<bodyText confidence="0.996259576923077">
available to the audience, the time, the place, and other para-
me.ters of the situation in which the text was produced, etc.&amp;quot;
(Bar-Hillel).
Now, it is obvious that for .an adequate translation, no
matter whethex it is human Ot.automatic, all this highly complex
information must be obtained and taken into, consideration, other-
wise the quality of translation falls down sharply. It is equally
obVious that all this is far beyond the linguist&apos;s reach at the
present stage of linguistic knowledge.
In order to arrive at a practical solution of this problem
one glould impose some restrictions on the process of MT. In
other words, certain criteria of the quality Of translation shotld
be formulated, and if necessary and possible, lowered. One might
try to restrict the output of an MT system in the sense that it
should certainly not produce what the user does not actually need
It is evident that the user of a translation of a scientific or
techniral text will not require as much finesse and subtlety as
the user of a translation of a literary text. Some (e.g. Garvin)
are prepared to go even further and consttuct systers which would
produce clearly inadeauate though still tolerable translations (in
a Tense nobody has even succeeded in defining) in order to gain in
speed. Now, when &amp;quot;machine-aided translation&apos; or similar approaches
are suggested, a restriction is imposed on what the computer is
supposed (and thought of as capable). to do.
The restriction on the input in RSA determines, ot course&apos;,
sore restrictions on the output (but, certainly, not to the extent
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.472342">

<bodyText confidence="0.99654508">
ot tolerating barely acceptable translations). On the other hand,
rather on the contrary, the simplicity and easier observability of
the material of a restricted sublanguage.make automatic transla-
tion feasible, allowing at the same time and for the same reason
for the total accountability of the sublanguage which makeg it
possible to account for and use for the practical purposes of
translation all the complex semantic and pragmatic iniformation
which might be relevant for translation. Of course, what makes it
possible is that the degree of complexity of such information in
the restructed sublanguage is very much inferior to what might be
observed in language as a whole. What follows, ,however, is that
restricting the input of an MT system to a sublanguage of a cer-
tain type RSA ensures high quality translation within the sub-
language and no further restrictions or lowering of the quality of
translation is necessary.
It should bt mentioned At this point that RSA shares with
&amp;quot;machine-aided translation&amp;quot; the property of requiring a limited
amount of predetermined &apos;and routine human participation prior to
automatic processing.
Syttax and semantics, lexicon and grammar. One of the nalor
claims of RSA is that, at least in applications to restricted sub-
languages, intricate and labor-consuming syntactic algorithms (cf.
Mel cuk, 1964) are redundant. The universal algorithm is based on
semantics and is designed to use linguistic information of &amp;quot;lower&amp;quot;
linaUistic levels (viz, morphology and syntax) in a few exceptional
</bodyText>

cases of semantic ambiguity. This emphasis an semantics rather
than on syntax in automatic language data processing systems takes
on a ,new value when compared to current discussions of the reLa-
tions of syntax and semantics in linguistic theory and the exis-
tence of a clear-cut boundary between, them. Probably influenced
by the tendency, at &apos;present prevailing statistically in theoretical
linguistics, to claim the priority of semantics over syntax, and,
moreover, to negate the existence of the boundary, even thOse re-
searchers in MT. who do not seem to be influenced by RSA also speak
in favor of such a &amp;quot;semanticallf-based&amp;quot; position (e.g. Mey). The
latter position is indirectly reinforced by the fact that purely
syntactic contributions to the Study, (e.g. Petrick) fail to _prove
:their pertinence to the problem of actual realization of MT bear-
ing instead on the relation of recent theoretical innovations to
the feasibility of MT (see. below).
Thanks to its basie principles and internal organization RSA
came independently to a justificatift of the claim made by Garvin
that it is operationally more effective to delegate most of the
grammatical information used in an MT system, to the lexicon rather
than to the parsing algorithm.

<bodyText confidence="0.993340538461538">
some relevant properties of the two extremes..
In the light of quite a number of promising developments and
achievements in linguistic theory, the pertinent question is whe-
ther these have, do, or will, contribute anything to MT, or the
latter, as Lyons thinks, &amp;quot;will neither contribute very directly to,
nor depend very direttly upon, advances in linguistic theory!&apos;
This basically defeatist position has at least two aspects, the
one being that Language is claimed to be too complicated to be
successfully subjected to automatic processing, an opinion many
theorists would subscribe to, and the other, proclaimed by MT
operationalists&amp;quot; (e.g. Garvin) that much of what has been recent-
ly proposed in grammatical and semantical theory is far, too strong
for MT, and much weaker models&apos;, as a possible theoretical basis
for practically feasible MT are required. Th...1 latter considera-
tion is interestingly illustrated by the fact of the recett emer-
gence of working automatic systems of language data processing,
auite close. in their restrictiveness to RSA though, rather contrary
to it, not aiming at theoretical generalization, which use&amp;quot;anal-
vsis-based grammars&amp;quot; (cf. Winograd, 1972).
-Howevr, it is natural for the linguist to be suspicious of
any attempts fo base an MT system on a theory, or a model, which
has been demonstrated to be inferior to somb other theory or model.
Any serious attempt to mance use of any linguistic knowledge for
any-purpose must, he might feel, be based on an adequate theoret-
ical framework, otherwise the ever present danger of ad hoc de-
cisions could hardly be avoided. What might le missed in this,
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.482332">

<bodyText confidence="0.948945421052631">
argumentation is the fact that, when dealing &apos;with computerized
applications Of linguistics, we impose on tht linguistic material
a fundamentally diferent phenomenon, with laws and logic of its
own, whith may be, very fbreign to the nature of human language
and the mental mechanism which underlies it, and this might force
us to give up purely lincuistic theories, even if they seem based
on the properties inherent in man&apos;s nature, and,to adopt, in man-
machine partnership, a compromising approach which would account
for botn human and machine nature. It is not unimaginable, though
rather distressing if true, that, due to the,essential difference
betweeri the two, no linguistic theory claiming or exhibiting the
property of adequacy to the nature at numan ianquage can be direct-
ly &amp;quot;computed&amp;quot;, i.e. taken in by the computer,
It seems, and this is substantiated by the material of some
papers contributed to the Study (e.g. Karttunen), that the more
dependent on some recent development in &amp;quot;Pue linguistics&amp;quot; a paper
is, the less pertinent to MT it becomes. The contradiction between
linguistic theory aiming at adequacy and practical needs of MT and,
for that matter, other problems of computational linguistics,
self-evident. In this situation RSA seems to be doing a uniqu job
of reconciliny the two extreme3, since on the material of a restric-
ted sublanguage it might turn out that the application of a .grammar
based on adequate linguistic theory would be auite practical and
there would not be any need to seek more fetsible ad hoc solutions.
Besides that, RSA may contribute a great geal to what is essentially
RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES 37
an issue between &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;practice&amp;quot; by:
(1) providing a °suitable &amp;quot;testing ground&amp;quot; for various conflicting
theories or models, both for those which claim linguistic adequacy
and analysis-based ones;
(2) allowing one to select the mott oreterable alternative on the
basis of complete and easily accessible evidence which might be
relevant for the choice;
(3) enabling one to limit the strength of a too powerful but valid
theory or model by making suitable modifications on the basis of
easily observable linguistic material of the restricted subdanguage.
The pasic principles of RSA malve one think of its language
independence.

by the programs in various ways. Here the working principles of
a program to produce the paradigm (set of inflected forms) of
each word in the Morphological Dictionary are presented.

numerous to be considered irregular. The method of storing the
several alilomorphs of the stem forfautomatic inflection misses
the natural unity of the word.
ftaye Constructed a mecnanicai Morphological Diationary/,
containing 205B written Rumanian words with a synthetic repre-
sentation of all these phonetic alternations. An algorithm based
on this representation generates tne inriectional noncompouna
forms of these words. They, are Rumanian nouns, adjectives, and
verbs, the main part belonging to the basic word stock 18, 17J.
About 45 perce,-at clE them present stem alternations.1

of a set of programs written in the programming language ASSIRIS

1. Recoding. The computer reads the word on the punched
card and recodes it into an internal Code; each letter is on
byte. A fixed letter has zone E or F (leading four bits 1110
or 1111); variable letters have other zones. The recoding
instruction in IRIS 50 is TRTR (translate and test).

2. Realization. The program reads the word be by byte.

If the zone is E or F, it writes the byte into the allomorph
registers. If the zone is less than E, the program constructs
a realizatiOn for each allomorph and stores it in the allomorph
register.
The principles that govern the decoding of a variable
letter into realitatiohs are given in [3]. As an example, take
the rule for regular variable letters (zone 0, 1 ... 7). Each
regular variable letter has two realizations, and in the internal
code the zone of each realization is F. The numeric of one
realization is identical with the numeric of the regular variable
letter, and the numeric of the other realization is greater by 1.
The method of encoding partitions for regular variable letters

The variable-letter, method has the advantage of keeping the
Unity of the word in the Morphological Dictionary and producing
the inflected forms correctly. At the same time it regularizes
the greatest part of the irregular words. The only irregular
verbs that still remain are A AVEA (to have), A DA (to give),
A FI (to be), A LUA (bo take), A STA (to stand).. The other
so-called irregular verbs A BEA Ito drink),,.A MINCA (to eat),
A RELUA (to retake), A USCA (to dry), A VREA (to want), and all
the other semiregular verbs b&apos;elonging to the third conjugation
[5, 14] are regular for our algorithm, and so are. the irregular
nouns SORA-SURORI (sister), NORA-NURORI (daughter-in-,law),
OM-OAMENI (man), etc.
The program contains 1455 ASSIR1S statements and generates
the inflected forms for all the 2058 words included in the
Morphological Dictionary in 1 minute 39 seconds. It represents
an experimental verification of our algorithm and may be
extended without essential modifications to all other Rumanian
words, coded in the same way.

Another program teant for users receives a word from the
punched card without its special external code or grammatical
parameters-, looks for it in the Morphological Didtionary file
now stored on the magnetic disk, and, if it is found, produces
the paradigm of the word. Exaliples.of its output appear on the
next two frames.
Subsequent frames exhibit the complete ihternal and external
codes.
The variable-letter method enables us to,form an easy algo-
rithm for morphological analysis, as indicated in [2].

After presentations are finished, speakers and audience will take part in general discussions. MOTIVATION AND GOALS In recent years, researchers in several disciplines have been converging on the problem of language understanding and memory as providing a handle on the problems in their own fields. Researchin Artificial concerned with building models of havekstarted to develop and study models of conversational interaction, which naturally rely on models of language understanding. This is often done without reference to th work of resea±chers in other disciplines. Linguistics, of course, has always been concerned with language, but frequently at no level higher than that of the senas derived from the consideration of THEORETICAL ISSUES 6 sentences out of context are difficult to apply to the task of understanding. Recently.some linguists such as Chafe have shifted their emphasis towards understanding and modelling discourse, which is of direct relevance to questiofts of understanding. have also problems of language understanding and memory. While early research did look to lthguistics to p-ovide plausible theories of human language bethe then-current insufficient to the task. As a result, some psychologists have begun to create theil own theories, while others have begun to pay attehtion to the wark of researchers. are now appearing which are plications of these theories&apos;. In the field of computational linguistics, the challenge of building computer systems which can carry on fluent and helpful dialogues with a user has Also shifted the emphasis in the field parsers to more capable understanders, In spite of this convergence of many different disciplines the same problem, there is sgrprisingly researchers in the different fields, occasional discovery of relevant papers in one field by members of another. Without conferenges of the sort that we are proposing, is. no for the individual in these different fields to talk to each other directly. The value of face-to-face confrontation and the opportunity for questions and exploring tme applicability of techniques in areas than the that author had in are appredisciplines syuch opportunities exist in traditional professional conferences. Our conference will provide an such interaction across a diversity of fields which would not otherwise be possible. THEORETICAL ISSUES 7 The need for such a conference is especially great in the area of natural language understanding. The many different fields which are beginning to give otrong attention to this problem all have different interests and consequently different emphases on the problem. Researchers in a particular field tend to focus on their own interests and ignore other aspects of the problem. For example, the classical transformational grammar theory has largely ignored the necessity for the theory to account for psycholinguistic and other performance aspects of language. This is a reasonable way to gain a restricted research problem, but the result of such research may suffer if the researcher does not have some general idea of the problems associated with the aspects that are being ignored. This conference will attempt to provide specialists in different fields with this type of general understanding of the problems of concern in other fields. We feel that this exposure to different aspects and eMphases will have a very beneficial effect on all fields of natural language research, and that without such&apos; interchange the potential for much of that research will not be realized. The opportunity for Such a meeting as we are preparing does not currently exist elsewhere. Conferences sponsored by professocieties present intradasciplinary views rather than interdisciplinary ones, and past intrdisciplinary workshops always been on small scale. For example, at the NSF sposored workshop in Woods Bole, Massachusetts, in 1971, some 25 interested in Semantics were together for two weeks of worthwhile talks. While the results of such a conference are largely intangible, a number of participants in that conference have attested to the impact of that conference on their way of thinking about problems and the course-of theit research. We plan to adhere to the model of the Woods Hole colference, but with the following two changes. THEORETICAL ISSUES 8 First it is important to create) the possibility fot the many new researchers from different fields who have entered this to gain an appreciation of the different of other fields. Secondly, it is important that a much larger number of people whose interests are .in one dis\cioline or another be exposed to the ideas emerging from the synthesis of these disci- Et is that more than just a small group be to ideas. Since a long workshop would be very difficult on the scale are proposing, we are relying an early circulation of posito all speakers and audialike, with current on language understanding in each of the fields. These preprints will also serve the of informing those unable to participate in the workof ideas, and de to make copies of the preprints widely available. ORGANIZATION The two sessions of each day will be held in the morning, and in the late afternoon. The long break fort lunch in between will facilitate discussions oi the morning&apos;s topic, without the need to get back to another session immediately. All sessions will be open to the public, and we expect about 150 people to participate. MIT was selected as a site so that widest interested people might be able to come at a reasonable cost. MIT has made a large air-conditioned lecture available, and will also provide low-cost dormitory for the participants.</abstract>

C: 20234 American Journal of Computational Linguistics Microfiche 9: 28 OPINION A RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGE APPROACH TO HIGH QUALITY TRANSLATION Victor Raskin Institute of Philosophy Hebrew University Israel This paper deals with an approach to the problems of automatic high quality translation and, more generally, of automatic language data processing, based on the restriction of the input of MT and other systems to A certain type of sublanguaqe. The approach was proposed by the present author in the framework of a general theory of sublanguages (see Raskin, 1971) And subsequently tested and used by his own and other groups of researchers in the USSR on tie, material of diverse restricted sublanguages (see ibid; Gorodeckij and Raskin, 1971, &apos;t.1). The paper consists of two parts. Part 1 contains a very brief exposition c the basic principle&apos;s of the approach. In Part 2 some aavantages of the approach over other (unspecified) approaches unrestricted in this way are mentioned in the context of a few important problems of high quality translation. Since these problems were also discussed by the contribUtors to Feasibility Study on Fully Automatic High Qua</context>

With its sualgorithms of &amp;quot;ellipsis analysis&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;homogeneous parts analysis&apos;, &amp;quot;boundar- analysis&amp;quot;, the algorithm o2erates as a uhiversal Turinc rachine in the sense, that having been fed the aniversally standardized inforrat/on on a particular restricted suhlanguage, it proceeds to an61yze it in the universal way and is equally applicable to each and every restricted language. RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES. 31 Is Restricted Sublangudge Approach, RSA, applicable to all, or at least most relevant cases or can it be applied only in a few exceptional situations?. It has been argued elsewhere (see Raskin, 1971; Ch.4.1) that the first alternative holds true while in the cases in which a polythematic informational system is needed it seems worthwhile to treat the processed texts as belonging to se&apos;veral distinct restricted sublanguages; and after distinguishing them with the help of a not too complicated device, to make use of the technique developed for restricted sublanguages. 2j RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGE SOLUTIONS TO SOME PRQBLEMS OF HIGH QUALITY TRANSLATION Semantics and pr-agmatics-alld the quality of translation.
