Engineers, mathematicians, physicists and chemists
have had them for years. Finally, artificial intelligence
researchers have available a handbook that is broad in
scope and appropriate in depth and that answers ques-
tions about the nature of the field and its techniques.
Volume 1 of the planned three-volume work covers
search, knowledge representation, understanding natu-
ral language and understanding spoken language.
The book is composed of over fifty short articles,
written by researchers in the particular areas. Each
section begins with an overview that motivates the
need for investigating the topic, introduces common
terminology, problems, and techniques, and provides
an historical perspective. Each article is short, to the
point and uncluttered by unnecessary jargon. The
hierarchical organization allows the reader to easily
select the appropriate level of presentation.
The chapter on search begins with problem repre-
sentation in the form of state-space representation,
problem-reduction representation and game trees.
There follow descriptions of the standard search tech-
niques: blind search, AND/OR graphs, heuristics,
minimax and alpha-beta pruning. The final section
reviews a representative selection of search programs,
from the Logic Theorist through ABSTRIPS.
The knowledge representation chapter reviews the
history of and problems inherent in machine transla-
tion. The next two sections on grammars and parsing
give excellent introductions to formal grammars, trans-
formational grammars, systemic grammars, case gram-
mars and their parsing techniques. The section on
Augmented Transition Networks is especially clear and
succinct. The following section on text generation is
sparse, which accurately reflects the state of the field.
The final section first surveys early natural language
processing systems before giving more detailed de-
scriptions of Wilks&apos; system, LUNAR, SHRDLU,
MARGIE, SAM and PAM, and LIFER.
The final chapter on understanding spoken lan-
guage itemizes and defines the types of knowledge
required at different processing levels, and then sur-
veys the HEARSAY, HARPY, HWIM and SRI/SDC
speech understanding systems.
This book has many potential users. The general
reader will get a clear idea of what that mysterious
handle &amp;quot;artificial intelligence&amp;quot; means, understand the
nature of the problems faced by researchers in Al and
be presented with technical details and descriptions of
existing programs. The student of AI will have a
clear, comprehensive text and reference work, which
can serve as an introduction to deeper reading and
further study. The Al researcher is provided with a
reference work, which will be of immense help in pre-
paring lectures, recalling specific techniques and re-
freshing one&apos;s memory about subareas of the field (or
perhaps learning them for the first time).
Volume 2 will include chapters on programming
languages for Al research, applications-oriented AI
research (science, mathematics, medicine and educa-
tion) and automatic programming. The third and final
volume will have sections on models of cognition, au-
tomatic deduction, vision, robotics, learning and plan-
ning, and problem solving.
For both browsing and study, the Handbook of
Artificial Intelligence is a joy and a pleasure.
