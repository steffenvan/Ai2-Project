This paper investigates the use of sublexi-
cal units as a solution to handling the com-
plex morphology with productive deriva-
tional processes, in the development of
a lexical functional grammar for Turkish.
Such sublexical units make it possible to
expose the internal structure of words with
multiple derivations to the grammar rules
in a uniform manner. This in turn leads to
more succinct and manageable rules. Fur-
ther, the semantics of the derivations can
also be systematically reflected in a com-
positional way by constructing PRED val-
ues on the fly. We illustrate how we use
sublexical units for handling simple pro-
ductive derivational morphology and more
interesting cases such as causativization,
etc., which change verb valency. Our pri-
ority is to handle several linguistic phe-
nomena in order to observe the effects of
our approach on both the c-structure and
the f-structure representation, and gram-
mar writing, leaving the coverage and
evaluation issues aside for the moment.

This paper presents highlights of a large scale lex-
ical functional grammar for Turkish that is being
developed in the context of the ParGram project1
In order to incorporate in a manageable way, the
complex morphology and the syntactic relations
mediated by morphological units, and to handle
lexical representations of very productive deriva-
tions, we have opted to develop the grammar using
sublexical units called inflectional groups.
Inflectional groups (IGs hereafter) represent the
inflectional properties of segments of a complex

word structure separated by derivational bound-
aries. An IG is typically larger than a morpheme
but smaller than a word (except when the word has
no derivational morphology in which case the IG
corresponds to the word). It turns out that it is
the IGs that actually define syntactic relations be-
tween words. A grammar for Turkish that is based
on words as units would have to refer to informa-
tion encoded at arbitrary positions in words, mak-
ing the task of the grammar writer much harder.
On the other hand, treating morphemes as units in
the grammar level implies that the grammar will
have to know about morphotactics making either
the morphological analyzer redundant, or repeat-
ing the information in the morphological analyzer
at the grammar level which is not very desirable.
IGs bring a certain form of normalization to the
lexical representation of a language like Turkish,
so that units in which the grammar rules refer to
are simple enough to allow easy access to the in-
formation encoded in complex word structures.
That IGs delineate productive derivational pro-
cesses in words necessitates a mechanism that re-
flects the effect of the derivations to semantic rep-
resentations and valency changes. For instance,
English LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) repre-
sents derivations as a part of the lexicon; both
happy and happiness are separately lexicalized.
Lexicalized representations of adjectives such as
easy and easier are related, so that both lexicalized
and phrasal comparatives would have the same
feature structure; easier would have the feature
structure
Encoding derivations in the lexicon could be ap-
plicable for languages with relatively unproduc-
tive derivational phenomena, but it certainly is not

possible to represent in the grammar lexicon,2 all
derived forms as lexemes for an agglutinative lan-
guage like Turkish. Thus one needs to incorpo-
rate such derivational processes in a principled
way along with the computation of the effects on
derivations on the representation of the semantic
information.
Lexical functional grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and
Bresnan, 1982) is a theory representing the syn-
tax in two parallel levels: Constituent structures
(c-structures) have the form of context-free phrase
structure trees. Functional structures (f-structures)
are sets of pairs of attributes and values; attributes
may be features, such as tense and gender, or func-
tions, such as subject and object. C-structures de-
fine the syntactic representation and f-structures
define more semantic representation. Therefore
c-structures are more language specific whereas
f-structures of the same phrase for different lan-
guages are expected to be similar to each other.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 reviews the related work both on
Turkish, and on issues similar to those addressed
in this paper. Section 3 motivates and presents IGs
while Section 4 explains how they are employed
in a LFG setting. Section 5 summarizes the ar-
chitecture and the current status of the our system.
Finally we give conclusions in Section 6.

G¨ung¨ord¨u and Oflazer (1995) describes a rather
extensive grammar for Turkish using the LFG
formalism. Although this grammar had a good
coverage and handled phenomena such as free-
constituent order, the underlying implementation
was based on pseudo-unification. But most cru-
cially, it employed a rather standard approach to
represent the lexical units: words with multiple
nested derivations were represented with complex
nested feature structures where linguistically rel-
evant information could be embedded at unpre-
dictable depths which made access to them in rules
extremely complex and unwieldy.
Bozs¸ahin (2002) employed morphemes overtly
as lexical units in a CCG framework to account
for a variety of linguistic phenomena in a pro-
totype implementation. The drawback was that
morphotactics was explicitly raised to the level of
the sentence grammar, hence the categorial lexi-
con accounted for both constituent order and the
morpheme order with no distinction. Oflazer’s de-
pendency parser (2003) used IGs as units between
which dependency relations were established. An-
other parser based on IGs is Eryi˘git and Oflazer’s

C¸akıcı (2005), used relations between IG-based

bank (Oflazer et al., 2003) to automatically induce

In a more general setting, Butt and King (2005)
have handled the morphological causative in Urdu
as a separate node in c-structure rules using LFG’s
restriction operator in semantic construction of
causatives. Their approach is quite similar to ours
yet differs in an important way: the rules explicitly
use morphemes as constituents so it is not clear if
this is just for this case, or all morphology is han-
dled at the syntax level.

Turkish is an agglutinative language where a se-
quence of inflectional and derivational morphemes
get affixed to a root (Oflazer, 1994). At the syntax
level, the unmarked constituent order is SOV, but
constituent order may vary freely as demanded by
the discourse context. Essentially all constituent
orders are possible, especially at the main sen-
tence level, with very minimal formal constraints.
In written text however, the unmarked order is
dominant at both the main sentence and embedded
clause level.
Turkish morphotactics is quite complicated: a
given word form may involve multiple derivations
and the number of word forms one can generate
from a nominal or verbal root is theoretically in-
finite. Turkish words found in typical text aver-
age about 3-4 morphemes including the stem, with
an average of about 1.23 derivations per word,
but given that certain noninflecting function words
such as conjuctions, determiners, etc. are rather
frequent, this number is rather close to 2 for in-
flecting word classes. Statistics from the Turkish
Treebank indicate that for sentences ranging be-
tween 2 words to 40 words (with an average of
about 8 words), the number of IGs range from 2
to 55 IGs (with an average of 10 IGs per sentence)
(Eryi˘git and Oflazer, 2006).
The morphological analysis of a word can be
represented as a sequence of tags corresponding
to the morphemes. In our morphological analyzer
output, the tag ˆDB denotes derivation boundaries
that we also use to define IGs. If we represent the
morphological information in Turkish in the fol-
lowing general form:

then each IGi denotes the relevant sequence of in-
flectional features including the part-of-speech for
the root (in IGl) and for any of the derived forms.

tions depending on any morphological ambiguity
brought about by alternative segmentations of the

The first IG indicates that the root is a singular
noun with nominative case marker and no posses-

tion into a verb whose semantics is “to acquire”
the preceding noun. The third IG indicates that a
causative verb (equivalent to “to punish” in En-
glish), is derived from the previous verb. The
fourth IG indicates the derivation of a passive verb
with positive polarity from the previous verb. Fi-
nally the last IG represents a derivation into future
participle which will function as a modifier in the
sentence.
The simple phrase eski kitaplarımdaki hikayeler

clarify how IGs are involved in syntactic relations:

boundaries are represented by ’+’ sign and mor-
phemes in solid boxes actually define one IG. The
dashed box around solid boxes is for word bound-
ary. As the example indicates, IGs may consist of
one or more morphemes.
Example (2) shows the corresponding f-
structure for this NP. Supporting the dependency
representation in Figure 1, f-structure of adjective
eski is placed as the adjunct of kitaplarımda, at
the innermost level. The semantics of the relative
suffix -ki is shown as ’rel(&apos; OBJ)’ where the f-
structure that represents the NP eski kitaplarımda
is the OBJ of the derived adjective. The new f-
structure with a PRED constructed on the fly, then
modifies the noun hikayeler. The derived adjective
behaves essentially like a lexical adjective. The ef-
fect of using IGs as the representative units can be
explicitly seen in c-structure where each IG cor-
responds to a separate node as in Example (3).5

gives rise to an OBJject in c-structure. More pre-
cisely, a derived phrase is always represented as
a binary tree where the right daughter is always
a DS. In f-structure DS unifies with the mother f-
structure and inserts PRED feature which subcat-
egorizes for a OBJ. The left daughter of the bi-
nary tree is the original form of the phrase that is

Examples (5) and (6) show respectively the con-
stituent structure (c-structure) and the correspond-
ing feature structure (f-structure) for this noun
phrase. Within the tree representation, each IG
corresponds to a separate node. Thus, the LFG
grammar rules constructing the c-structures are
coded using IGs as units of parsing. If an IG con-
tains the root morpheme of a word, then the node
corresponding to that IG is named as one of the
syntactic category symbols. The rest of the IGs
are given the node name DS (to indicate deriva-
tional suffix), no matter what the content of the IG
is.
The semantic representation of derivational suf-
fixes plays an important role in f-structure con-
struction. In almost all cases, each derivation that
is induced by an overt or a covert affix gets a OBJ
feature which is then unified with the f-structure of
the preceding stem already constructed, to obtain
the feature structure of the derived form, with the
PRED of the derived form being constructed on
the fly. A PRED feature thus constructed however
is not meant to necessarily have a precise lexical
semantics. Most derivational suffixes have a con-
sistent (lexical) semantics6, but some don’t, that
is, the precise additional lexical semantics that the
derivational suffix brings in, depends on the stem
it is affixed to. Nevertheless, we represent both
cases in the same manner, leaving the determina-
tion of the precise lexical semantics aside.
If we consider Figure 2 in terms of dependency
relations, the adjective mavi (blue) modifies the
noun renk (color) and then the derivational suf-
fix -li (with) kicks in although the -li is attached
to renk only. Therefore, the semantics of the
phrase should be with(blue color), not blue
with(color). With the approach we take, this
difference can easily be represented in both the f-
structure as in the leftmost branch in Example (5)
6e.g., the “to acquire” example earlier

Once the grammar encounters such a sentential
complement, everything up to the participle IG is
parsed, as a normal sentence and then the partici-
ple IG appends nominal features, e.g., CASE, to
the existing f-structure. The final f-structure is for
a noun phrase, which now is the object of the ma-
trix verb, as shown in Example (9). Since the par-
ticiple IG has the right set of syntactic features of
a noun, no new rules are needed to incorporate the
derived f-structure to the rest of the grammar, that
is, the derived phrase can be used as if it is a sim-
ple NP within the rules. The same mechanism is
used for all kinds of verbal derivations into infini-
tives, adverbial adjuncts, including those deriva-
tions encoded by lexical reduplications identified
by multi-word construct processors.
Relative clauses also admit to a similar mech-
anism. Relative clauses in Turkish are gapped
sentences which function as modifiers of nominal
heads. Turkish relative clauses have been previ-
ously studied (Barker et al., 1990; G¨ung¨ord¨u and
Engdahl, 1998) and found to pose interesting is-
sues for linguistic and computational modeling.
Our aim here is not to address this problem in its
generality but show with a simple example, how
our treatment of IGs encoding derived forms han-
dle the mechanics of generating f-structures for
such cases.
Kaplan and Zaenen (1988) have suggested a
general approach for handling long distance de-
pendencies. They have extended the LFG notation
and allowed regular expressions in place of sim-
ple attributes within f-structure constraints so that
phenomena requiring infinite disjunctive enumer-
ation can be described with a finite expression. We
basically follow this approach and once we derive
the participle phrase we unify it with the appro-
priate argument of the verb using rules based on
functional uncertainty. Example (10) shows a rel-
ative clause where a participle form is used as a
modifier of a head noun, adam in this case.

This time, the sentence is parsed with a gap with
an appropriate functional uncertainty constraint,
and when the participle IG is encountered the sen-
tence f-structure is derived into an adjective and
the gap in the derived form, the object here, is
then unified with the head word as marked with
co-indexation in Example (11).
The example sentence (10) includes Example
(8) as a relative clause with the object extracted,
hence the similarity in the f-structures can be ob-
served easily. The ADJUNCT in Example (11)

whether the core sentence is a complete sentence
or not, the finite verb requirement is checked.
Since the requirement is met by the existence of

Turkish verbal morphotactics allows the produc-

verb formations are also treated as verbal deriva-
tions and hence define IGs. For instance, the mor-

is
ara+Verb+Pos+Past+A3sg
and for its causative aratti (s/he made (someone
else) call) the analysis is
ara+VerbˆDB+Verb+Caus+Pos+Past+A3sg.
In Example (12) we see a sentence and its
causative form followed by respective f-structures
for these sentences in Examples (13) and (14). The
detailed morphological analyses of the verbs are
given to emphasize the morphosyntactic relation
between the bare and causatived versions of the

The end-result of processing an IG which has a
verb with a causative form is to create a larger f-
structure whose PRED feature has a SUBJect, an
OBJect and a XCOMPlement. The f-structure of
the first verb is the complement in the f-structure
of the causative form, that is, its whole structure is
embedded into the mother f-structure in an encap-
sulated way. The object of the causative (causee
- that who is caused by the causer – the sub-
ject of the causative verb) is unified with the sub-
ject the inner f-structure. If the original verb is
transitive, the object of the original verb is fur-
ther unified with the OBJTH of the causative
verb. All of grammatical functions in the inner
f-structure, namely XCOMP, are also represented
in the mother f-structure and are placed as argu-
ments of caus since the flat representation is re-
quired to enable free word order in sentence level.
Though not explicit in the sample f-structures,
the important part is unifying the object and for-
mer subject with appropriate case markers, since
the functions of the phrases in the sentence are de-
cided with the help of case markers due to free
word order. If the verb that is causativized sub-
categorizes for an direct object in accusative case,
after causative formation, the new object unified
with the subject of the causativized verb should
be in dative case (Example 15). But if the verb
in question subcategorizes for a dative or an abla-
tive oblique object, then this object will be trans-
formed into a direct object in accusative case after
causativization (Example 16). That is, the causati-
vation will select the case of the object of the
causative verb, so as not to “interfere” with the ob-
ject of the verb that is causativized. In causativized
intransitive verbs the causative object is always in
accusative case.

5 Current Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963142857143">
The implementation of the Turkish LFG gram-
mar is based on the Xerox Linguistic Environ-
ment (XLE) (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1996), a
grammar development platform that facilitates the
integration of various modules, such as tokeniz-
ers, finite-state morphological analyzers, and lex-
icons. We have integrated into XLE, a series of
finite state transducers for morphological analysis
and for multi-word processing for handling lexi-
calized, semi-lexicalized collocations and a lim-
ited form of non-lexicalized collocations.
The finite state modules provide the rele-
vant ambiguous morphological interpretations for
words and their split into IGs, but do not provide
syntactically relevant semantic and subcategoriza-
tion information for root words. Such information
is encoded in a lexicon of root words on the gram-
mar side.
The grammar developed so far addresses many
important aspects ranging from free constituent or-
der, subject and non-subject extractions, all kinds
of subordinate clauses mediated by derivational
morphology and has a very wide coverage NP sub-
grammar. As we have also emphasized earlier, the
actual grammar rules are oblivious to the source of
the IGs, so that the same rule handles an adjective
- noun phrase regardless of whether the adjective
is lexical or a derived one. So all such relations in
Figure 28 are handled with the same phrase struc-
ture rule.
The grammar is however lacking the treatment
of certain interesting features of Turkish such as
suspended affixation (Kabak, 2007) in which the
inflectional features of the last element in a co-
ordination have a phrasal scope, that is, all other

8Except the last one which requires some additional treat-
ment with respect to definiteness.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.996499444444444">
coordinated constituents have certain default fea-
tures which are then “overridden” by the features
of the last element in the coordination. A very sim-
ple case of such suspended affixation is exempli-
fied in (17a) and (17b). Note that although this is
not due to derivational morphology that we have
emphasized in the previous examples, it is due to
a more general nature of morphology in which af-
fixes may have phrasal scopes.

Suspended affixation is an example of a phe-
nomenon that IGs do not seem directly suitable
for. The unification of the coordinated IGs have to
be done in a way in which non-default features of
the final constituent is percolated to the upper node
in the tree as is usually done with phrase struc-
ture grammars but unlike coordination is handled
in such grammars.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998655">
This paper has described the highlights of our
work on developing a LFG grammar for Turkish
employing sublexical constituents, that we have
called inflectional groups. Such a sublexical con-
stituent choice has enabled us to handle the very
productive derivational morphology in Turkish in
a rather principled way and has made the grammar
more or less oblivious to morphological complex-
ity.
Our current and future work involves extending
the coverage of the grammar and lexicon as we
have so far included in the grammar lexicon only
a small subset of the root lexicon of the morpho-
logical analyzer, annotated with the semantic and
subcategorization features relevant to the linguis-
tic phenomena that we have handled. We also in-
tend to use the Turkish Treebank (Oflazer et al.,
2003), as a resource to extract statistical informa-
tion along the lines of Frank et al. (2003) and
O’Donovan et al. (2005).

<abstract confidence="0.99906308">This paper investigates the use of sublexical units as a solution to handling the complex morphology with productive derivational processes, in the development of a lexical functional grammar for Turkish. Such sublexical units make it possible to expose the internal structure of words with multiple derivations to the grammar rules in a uniform manner. This in turn leads to more succinct and manageable rules. Further, the semantics of the derivations can also be systematically reflected in a compositional way by constructing PRED values on the fly. We illustrate how we use sublexical units for handling simple productive derivational morphology and more interesting cases such as causativization, etc., which change verb valency. Our priority is to handle several linguistic phenomena in order to observe the effects of our approach on both the c-structure and the f-structure representation, and grammar writing, leaving the coverage and evaluation issues aside for the moment.</abstract>

Relative clauses also admit to a similar mechanism. Relative clauses in Turkish are gapped sentences which function as modifiers of nominal heads. Turkish relative clauses have been previously studied (Barker et al., 1990; G¨ung¨ord¨u and Engdahl, 1998) and found to pose interesting issues for linguistic and computational modeling.

That IGs delineate productive derivational processes in words necessitates a mechanism that reflects the effect of the derivations to semantic representations and valency changes. For instance, English LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) represents derivations as a part of the lexicon; both happy and happiness are separately lexicalized. Lexicalized representations of adjectives such as easy and easier are related, so that both lexicalized and phrasal comparatives would have the same feature structure; easier would have the feature structure Encoding derivations in the lexicon could be applicable for languages with relatively unproductive derivational phenomena, but it certainly is not (1) � ����� PRED ‘easy’ 1 ADJUNCT ~PRED ‘more’~ DEG-DIM pos DEGREE comparative 153 Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computa</context>

Turkish relative clauses have been previously studied (Barker et al., 1990; G¨ung¨ord¨u and Engdahl, 1998) and found to pose interesting issues for linguistic and computational modeling. Our aim here is not to address this problem in its generality but show with a simple example, how our treatment of IGs encoding derived forms handle the mechanics of generating f-structures for such cases. Kaplan and Zaenen (1988) have suggested a general approach for handling long distance dependencies. They have extended the LFG notation and allowed regular expressions in place of simple attributes within f-structure constraints so that phenomena requiring infinite disjunctive enumeration can be described with a finite expression. We basically follow this approach and once we derive the participle phrase we unify it with the appropriate argument of the verb using rules based on functional uncertainty. Example (10) shows a relative clause where a participle form is used as a modifier of a head noun, adam in this case.</context>

In a more general setting, Butt and King (2005) have handled the morphological causative in Urdu as a separate node in c-structure rules using LFG’s restriction operator in semantic construction of causatives. Their approach is quite similar to ours yet differs in an important way: the rules explicitly use morphemes as constituents so it is not clear if this is just for this case, or all morphology is handled at the syntax level. 3 Inflectional Groups as Sublexical Units Turkish is an agglutinative language where a sequence of inflectional and derivational morphemes get affixed to a root (Oflazer, 1994). At the syntax level, the unmarked constituent order is SOV, but constituent order may vary freely as demanded by the discourse context. Essentially all constituent orders are possible, especially at the main sentence level, with very minimal formal constraints. In written text however, the unmarked order is dominant at both the main sentence and embedded clause level. Turkish morphotactics is quite complicated: a given word form may involve multiple derivations and the number of word forms one can generate from a nominal or verbal root is theoretically infinite.
