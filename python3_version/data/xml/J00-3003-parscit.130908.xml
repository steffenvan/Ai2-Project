We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speech-
act-like units such as STATEMENT, QUESTION, BACKCHANNEL, AGREEMENT, DISAGREE-
MENT, and APOLOGY. Our model detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, colloca-
tional, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence.
The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden
Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states.
Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The
statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks
modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act. We develop
a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue modeling, to improve both speech
recognition and dialogue act classification accuracy. Models are trained and evaluated using a
large hand-labeled database of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous
human-to-human telephone speech. We achieved good dialogue act labeling accuracy (65% based
on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody, and 71% based on word transcripts,
compared to a chance baseline accuracy of 35% and human accuracy of 84%) and a small reduction
in word recognition error.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951034482759">
The ability to model and automatically detect discourse structure is an important
step toward understanding spontaneous dialogue. While there is hardly consensus
on exactly how discourse structure should be described, some agreement exists that
a useful first level of analysis involves the identification of dialogue acts (DAs). A
DA represents the meaning of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force (Austin
1962). Thus, a DA is approximately the equivalent of the speech act of Searle (1969),
the conversational game move of Power (1979), or the adjacency pair part of Schegloff
(1968) and Saks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974).
Table 1 shows a sample of the kind of discourse structure in which we are inter-
ested. Each utterance is assigned a unique DA label (shown in column 2), drawn from
a well-defined set (shown in Table 2). Thus, DAs can be thought of as a tag set that
classifies utterances according to a combination of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic
criteria. The computational community has usually defined these DA categories so as
to be relevant to a particular application, although efforts are under way to develop
DA labeling systems that are domain-independent, such as the Discourse Resource
Initiative&apos;s DAMSL architecture (Core and Allen 1997).
While not constituting dialogue understanding in any deep sense, DA tagging
seems clearly useful to a range of applications. For example, a meeting summarizer
needs to keep track of who said what to whom, and a conversational agent needs to
know whether it was asked a question or ordered to do something. In related work
DAs are used as a first processing step to infer dialogue games (Carlson 1983; Levin
and Moore 1977; Levin et al. 1999), a slightly higher level unit that comprises a small
number of DAs. Interactional dominance (Linell 1990) might be measured more ac-
curately using DA distributions than with simpler techniques, and could serve as an
indicator of the type or genre of discourse at hand. In all these cases, DA labels would
enrich the available input for higher-level processing of the spoken words. Another im-
portant role of DA information could be feedback to lower-level processing. For exam-
ple, a speech recognizer could be constrained by expectations of likely DAs in a given
context, constraining the potential recognition hypotheses so as to improve accuracy.

The goal of this article is twofold: On the one hand, we aim to present a com-
prehensive framework for modeling and automatic classification of DAs, founded on
well-known statistical methods. In doing so, we will pull together previous approaches
as well as new ideas. For example, our model draws on the use of DA n-grams and the
hidden Markov models of conversation present in earlier work, such as Nagata and
Morimoto (1993, 1994) and Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) (see Section 7). However,
our framework generalizes earlier models, giving us a clean probabilistic approach for
performing DA classification from unreliable words and nonlexical evidence. For the

speech recognition task, our framework provides a mathematically principled way to
condition the speech recognizer on conversation context through dialogue structure, as
well as on nonlexical information correlated with DA identity. We will present meth-
ods in a domain-independent framework that for the most part treats DA labels as an
arbitrary formal tag set. Throughout the presentation, we will highlight the simplifi-
cations and assumptions made to achieve tractable models, and point out how they
might fall short of reality.
Second, we present results obtained with this approach on a large, widely available
corpus of spontaneous conversational speech. These results, besides validating the
methods described, are of interest for several reasons. For example, unlike in most
previous work on DA labeling, the corpus is not task-oriented in nature, and the
amount of data used (198,000 utterances) exceeds that in previous studies by at least
an order of magnitude (see Table 14).
To keep the presentation interesting and concrete, we will alternate between the
description of general methods and empirical results. Section 2 describes the task
and our data in detail. Section 3 presents the probabilistic modeling framework; a
central component of this framework, the discourse grammar, is further discussed in
Section 4. In Section 5 we describe experiments for DA classification. Section 6 shows
how DA models can be used to benefit speech recognition. Prior and related work is
summarized in Section 7. Further issues and open problems are addressed in Section 8,
followed by concluding remarks in Section 9.

2. The Dialogue Act Labeling Task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999765666666667">
The domain we chose to model is the Switchboard corpus of human-human con-
versational telephone speech (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel 1992) distributed by
the Linguistic Data Consortium. Each conversation involved two randomly selected
strangers who had been charged with talking informally about one of several, self-
selected general-interest topics. To train our statistical models on this corpus, we com-
bined an extensive effort in human hand-coding of DAs for each utterance, with a
variety of automatic and semiautomatic tools. Our data consisted of a substantial
portion of the Switchboard waveforms and corresponding transcripts, totaling 1,155
conversations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999697">
2.1 Utterance Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775">
Before hand-labeling each utterance in the corpus with a DA, we needed to choose an
utterance segmentation, as the raw Switchboard data is not segmented in a linguis-
tically consistent way. To expedite the DA labeling task and remain consistent with
other Switchboard-based research efforts, we made use of a version of the corpus that
had been hand-segmented into sentence-level units prior to our own work and in-
dependently of our DA labeling system (Meteer et al. 1995). We refer to the units of
this segmentation as utterances. The relation between utterances and speaker turns
is not one-to-one: a single turn can contain multiple utterances, and utterances can
span more than one turn (e.g., in the case of backchanneling by the other speaker in
midutterance). Each utterance unit was identified with one DA, and was annotated
with a single DA label. The DA labeling system had special provisions for rare cases
where utterances seemed to combine aspects of several DA types.
Automatic segmentation of spontaneous speech is an open research problem in its
own right (Mast et al. 1996; Stolcke and Shriberg 1996). A rough idea of the difficulty
of the segmentation problem on this corpus and using the same definition of utterance
units can be derived from a recent study (Shriberg et al. 2000). In an automatic labeling

of word boundaries as either utterance or nonboundaries using a combination of lexical
and prosodic cues, we obtained 96% accuracy based on correct word transcripts, and
78% accuracy with automatically recognized words. The fact that the segmentation
and labeling tasks are interdependent (Wamke et al. 1997; Finke et al. 1998) further
complicates the problem.
Based on these considerations, we decided not to confound the DA classification
task with the additional problems introduced by automatic segmentation and assumed
the utterance-level segmentations as given. An important consequence of this decision
is that we can expect utterance length and acoustic properties at utterance boundaries
to be accurate, both of which turn out to be important features of DAs (Shriberg et al.
1998; see also Section 5.2.1).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998254">
2.2 Tag Set
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957852941177">
We chose to follow a recent standard for shallow discourse structure annotation, the
Dialog Act Markup in Several Layers (DAMSL) tag set, which was designed by the
natural language processing community under the auspices of the Discourse Resource
Initiative (Core and Allen 1997). We began with the DAMSL markup system, but modi-
fied it in several ways to make it more relevant to our corpus and task. DAMSL aims to
provide a domain-independent framework for dialogue annotation, as reflected by the
fact that our tag set can be mapped back to DAMSL categories (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and
Biasca 1997). However, our labeling effort also showed that content- and task-related
distinctions will always play an important role in effective DA labeling.
The Switchboard domain itself is essentially &amp;quot;task-free,&amp;quot; thus giving few external
constraints on the definition of DA categories. Our primary purpose in adapting the
tag set was to enable computational DA modeling for conversational speech, with
possible improvements to conversational speech recognition. Because of the lack of a
specific task, we decided to label categories that seemed inherently interesting linguis-
tically and that could be identified reliably. Also, the focus on conversational speech
recognition led to a certain bias toward categories that were lexically or syntactically
distinct (recognition accuracy is traditionally measured including all lexical elements
in an utterance).
While the modeling techniques described in this paper are formally independent of
the corpus and the choice of tag set, their success on any particular task will of course
crucially depend on these factors. For different tasks, not all the techniques used in
this study might prove useful and others could be of greater importance. However,
we believe that this study represents a fairly comprehensive application of technology
in this area and can serve as a point of departure and reference for other work.
The resulting SWBD-DAMSL tag set was multidimensional; approximately 50 ba-
sic tags (e.g., QUESTION, STATEMENT) could each be combined with diacritics indicat-
ing orthogonal information, for example, about whether or not the dialogue function
of the utterance was related to Task-Management and Communication-Management.
Approximately 220 of the many possible unique combinations of these codes were used
by the coders (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca 1997). To obtain a system with somewhat
higher interlabeler agreement, as well as enough data per class for statistical mod-
eling purposes, a less fine-grained tag set was devised. This tag set distinguishes 42
mutually exclusive utterance types and was used for the experiments reported here.
Table 2 shows the 42 categories with examples and relative frequencies.&apos; While some

set was further reduced to six categories.

of the original infrequent classes were collapsed, the resulting DA type distribution
is still highly skewed. This occurs largely because there was no basis for subdividing
the dominant DA categories according to task-independent and reliable criteria.
The tag set incorporates both traditional sociolinguistic and discourse-theoretic
notions, such as rhetorical relations and adjacency pairs, as well as some more form-
based labels. Furthermore, the tag set is structured so as to allow labelers to annotate
a Switchboard conversation from transcripts alone (i.e., without listening) in about
30 minutes. Without these constraints the DA labels might have included some finer
distinctions, but we felt that this drawback was balanced by the ability to cover a large
amount of data.&apos;
Labeling was carried out in a three-month period in 1997 by eight linguistics
graduate students at CU Boulder. Interlabeler agreement for the 42-label tag set used
here was 84%, resulting in a Kappa statistic of 0.80. The Kappa statistic measures
agreement normalized for chance (Siegel and Castellan, Jr. 1988). As argued in Carletta
(1996), Kappa values of 0.8 or higher are desirable for detecting associations between
several coded variables; we were thus satisfied with the level of agreement achieved.
(Note that, even though only a single variable, DA type, was coded for the present
study, our goal is, among other things, to model associations between several instances
of that variable, e.g., between adjacent DAs.)
A total of 1,155 Switchboard conversations were labeled, comprising 205,000 ut-
terances and 1.4 million words. The data was partitioned into a training set of 1,115
conversations (1.4M words, 198K utterances), used for estimating the various compo-
nents of our model, and a test set of 19 conversations (29K words, 4K utterances).
Remaining conversations were set aside for future use (e.g., as a test set uncompro-
mised of tuning effects).

2.3 Major Dialogue Act Types

<bodyText confidence="0.9996568">
The more frequent DA types are briefly characterized below. As discussed above, the
focus of this paper is not on the nature of DAs, but on the computational framework
for their recognition; full details of the DA tag set and numerous motivating examples
can be found in a separate report (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca 1997).
Statements and Opinions. The most common types of utterances were STATEMENTS
and OPINIONS. This split distinguishes &amp;quot;descriptive, narrative, or personal&amp;quot; statements
(STATEMENT) from &amp;quot;other-directed opinion statements&amp;quot; (OPINION). The distinction was
designed to capture the different kinds of responses we saw to opinions (which are
often countered or disagreed with via further opinions) and to statements (which more
often elicit continuers or backchannels):

2 The effect of lacking acoustic information on labeling accuracy was assessed by relabeling a subset of
the data with listening, and was found to be fairly small (Shriberg et al. 1998). A conservative estimate
based on the relabeling study is that, for most DA types, at most 2% of the labels might have changed
based on listening. The only DA types with higher uncertainty were BACKCHANNELS and
AGREEMENTS, which are easily confused with each other without acoustic cues; here the rate of change
was no more than 10%.

OPINIONS often include such hedges as I think, I believe, it seems, and I mean. We
combined the STATEMENT and OPINION classes for other studies on dimensions in
which they did not differ (Shriberg et al. 1998).
Questions. Questions were of several types. The YES-No-QUESTION label includes only
utterances having both the pragmatic force of a yes-no-question and the syntactic mark-
ings of a yes-no-question (i.e., subject-inversion or sentence-final tags). DECLARATIVE-
QUESTIONS are utterances that function pragmatically as questions but do not have
&amp;quot;question form.&amp;quot; By this we mean that declarative questions normally have no wh-
word as the argument of the verb (except in &amp;quot;echo-question&amp;quot; format), and have &amp;quot;declar-
ative&amp;quot; word order in which the subject precedes the verb. See Weber (1993) for a survey
of declarative questions and their various realizations.

Backchannels. A backchannel is a short utterance that plays discourse-structuring roles,
e.g., indicating that the speaker should go on talking. These are usually referred to in
the conversation analysis literature as &amp;quot;continuers&amp;quot; and have been studied extensively
(Jefferson 1984; Schegloff 1982; Yngve 1970). We expect recognition of backchannels to
be useful because of their discourse-structuring role (knowing that the hearer expects
the speaker to go on talking tells us something about the course of the narrative)
and because they seem to occur at certain kinds of syntactic boundaries; detecting a
backchannel may thus help in predicting utterance boundaries and surrounding lexical
material.
For an intuition about what backchannels look like, Table 3 shows the most com-
mon realizations of the approximately 300 types (35,827 tokens) of backchannel in
our Switchboard subset. The following table shows examples of backchannels in the
context of a Switchboard conversation:

so they look a lot like ANSWERS. But where ANSWERS follow questions, AGREEMENTS
often follow opinions or proposals, so distinguishing these can be important for the
discourse.

We will now describe the mathematical and computational framework used in our

ters automatically from a corpus, using statistical inference techniques.
Given all available evidence E about a conversation, the goal is to find the DA

lihood of U given the evidence. The likelihood is usually much more straightforward
to model than the posterior itself. This has to do with the fact that our models are
generative or causal in nature, i.e., they describe how the evidence is produced by the
underlying DA sequence U.
Estimating P(U) requires building a probabilistic discourse grammar, i.e., a statisti-
cal model of DA sequences. This can be done using familiar techniques from language
modeling for speech recognition, although the sequenced objects in this case are DA
labels rather than words; discourse grammars will be discussed in detail in Section 4.

3.1 Dialogue Act Likelihoods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997722090909091">
The computation of likelihoods P(EIU) depends on the types of evidence used. In our
experiments we used the following sources of evidence, either alone or in combination:
Transcribed words: The likelihoods used in Equation 1 are P(WI U), where W
refers to the true (hand-transcribed) words spoken in a conversation.
Recognized words: The evidence consists of recognizer acoustics A, and we seek
to compute P(A I U). As described later, this involves considering multiple
alternative recognized word sequences.
Prosodic features: Evidence is given by the acoustic features F capturing various
aspects of pitch, duration, energy, etc., of the speech signal; the associated
likelihoods are P(F1U).
For ease of reference, all random variables used here are summarized in Table 4.
The same variables are used with subscripts to refer to individual utterances. For
example, Wi is the word transcription of the ith utterance within a conversation (not
the ith word).
To make both the modeling and the search for the best DA sequence feasible, we
further require that our likelihood models are decomposable by utterance. This means
that the likelihood given a complete conversation can be factored into likelihoods
given the individual utterances. We use LI, for the ith DA label in the sequence U,
i.e., U = (U1,. â¢ ,U,, â¢â¢â¢ where n is the number of utterances in a conversation.
In addition, we use E, for that portion of the evidence that corresponds to the ith
utterance, e.g., the words or the prosody of the ith utterance. Decomposability of the
likelihood means that

might actually be relevant to the question before it, violating the independence of the
P(W11U1). Similarly, speakers adjust their pitch or volume over time, e.g., to the con-
versation partner or because of the structure of the discourse (Menn and Boyce 1982),
violating the independence of the P(F I U,). As in other areas of statistical modeling,
we count on the fact that these violations are small compared to the properties actually
modeled, namely, the dependence of E1 on Lli.

3.2 Markov Modeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957525">
Returning to the prior distribution of DA sequences P(U), it is convenient to make
certain independence assumptions here, too. In particular, we assume that the prior
distribution of L/ is Markovian, i.e., that each U, depends only on a fixed number k of
preceding DA labels:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996306">
P(Ui I â¢ â¢ â¢ , -= P(Lli I Ui-k, â¢ â¢ â¢ (3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999418125">
(k is the order of the Markov process describing U). The n-gram-based discourse gram-
mars we used have this property. As described later, k = 1 is a very good choice, i.e.,
conditioning on the DA types more than one removed from the current one does not
improve the quality of the model by much, at least with the amount of data available
in our experiments.
The importance of the Markov assumption for the discourse grammar is that
we can now view the whole system of discourse grammar and local utterance-based
likelihoods as a kth-order hidden Markov model (HMM) (Rabiner and juang 1986).
The HMM states correspond to DAs, observations correspond to utterances, transition
probabilities are given by the discourse grammar (see Section 4), and observation
probabilities are given by the local likelihoods P(EilU,).
We can represent the dependency structure (as well as the implied conditional
independences) as a special case of Bayesian belief network (Pearl 1988). Figure 1
shows the variables in the resulting HMM with directed edges representing conditional
dependence. To keep things simple, a first-order HMM (bigram discourse grammar)
is assumed.

The combination of likelihood and prior modeling, HMMs, and Viterbi decoding is
fundamentally the same as the standard probabilistic approaches to speech recognition
(Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983) and tagging (Church 1988). It maximizes the prob-
ability of getting the entire DA sequence correct, but it does not necessarily find the
DA sequence that has the most DA labels correct (Dermatas and Kokkinakis 1995). To
minimize the total number of utterance labeling errors, we need to maximize the prob-
ability of getting each DA label correct individually, i.e., we need to maximize P(U11E)
for each i = 1,. . . ,n. We can compute the per-utterance posterior DA probabilities by
summing:

<equation confidence="0.985996">
P(uIE) -= P(UE) (5)
U: u,=u
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978588235294">
where the summation is over all sequences U whose ith element matches the label in
question. The summation is efficiently carried out by the forward-backward algorithm
for HMMs (Baum et al. 1970).3
For zeroth-order (unigram) discourse grammars, Viterbi decoding and forward-
backward decoding necessarily yield the same results. However, for higher-order
discourse grammars we found that forward-backward decoding consistently gives
slightly (up to 1% absolute) better accuracies, as expected. Therefore, we used this
method throughout.
The formulation presented here, as well as all our experiments, uses the entire
conversation as evidence for DA classification. Obviously, this is possible only during
off-line processing, when the full conversation is available. Our paradigm thus follows
historical practice in the Switchboard domain, where the goal is typically the off-line
processing (e.g., automatic transcription, speaker identification, indexing, archival) of
entire previously recorded conversations. However, the HMM formulation used here
also supports computing posterior DA probabilities based on partial evidence, e.g.,
using only the utterances preceding the current one, as would be required for on-line
processing.

4. Discourse Grammars

<bodyText confidence="0.999971">
The statistical discourse grammar models the prior probabilities P(U) of DA sequences.
In the case of conversations for which the identities of the speakers are known (as
in Switchboard), the discourse grammar should also model turn-taking behavior. A
straightforward approach is to model sequences of pairs (U1, TO where Ili is the DA
label and T, represents the speaker. We are not trying to model speaker idiosyncrasies,
so conversants are arbitrarily identified as A or B, and the model is made symmetric
with respect to the choice of sides (e.g., by replicating the training sequences with
sides switched). Our discourse grammars thus had a vocabulary of 42 x 2 = 84 labels,
plus tags for the beginning and end of conversations. For example, the second DA tag
in Table 1 would be predicted by a trigram discourse grammar using the fact that the
same speaker previously uttered a YES-No-QUESTION, which in turn was preceded by
the start-of-conversation.

4.1 N-gram Discourse Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974395">
A computationally convenient type of discourse grammar is an n-gram model based on
DA tags, as it allows efficient decoding in the HMM framework. We trained standard
backoff n-gram models (Katz 1987), using the frequency smoothing approach of Witten
and Bell (1991). Models of various orders were compared by their perplexities, i.e.,
the average number of choices the model predicts for each tag, conditioned on the
preceding tags.
Table 5 shows perplexities for three types of models: P(U), the DAs alone; P(U, T),
the combined DA/speaker ID sequence; and P(UIT), the DAs conditioned on known
speaker IDs (appropriate for the Switchboard task). As expected, we see an improve-
ment (decreasing perplexities) for increasing n-gram order. However, the incremental
gain of a trigram is small, and higher-order models did not prove useful. (This ob-
servation, initially based on perplexity, is confirmed by the DA tagging experiments
reported in Section 5.) Comparing P(U) and P(UIT), we see that speaker identity adds
substantial information, especially for higher-order models.
The relatively small improvements from higher-order models could be a result of
lack of training data, or of an inherent independence of DAs from DAs further re-
moved. The near-optimality of the bigram discourse grammar is plausible given con-
versation analysis accounts of discourse structure in terms of adjacency pairs (Schegloff
1968; Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974). Inspection of bigram probabilities estimated
from our data revealed that conventional adjacency pairs receive high probabilities, as
expected. For example, 30% of YES-NO-QUESTIONS are followed by YES-ANSWERS,
14% by NO-ANSWERS (confirming that the latter are dispreferred). COMMANDS are fol-
lowed by AGREEMENTS in 23% of the cases, and STATEMENTS elicit BACKCHANNELS
in 26% of all cases.

4.2 Other Discourse Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975769230769">
We also investigated non-n-gram discourse models, based on various language model-
ing techniques known from speech recognition. One motivation for alternative models
is that n-grams enforce a one-dimensional representation on DA sequences, whereas
we saw above that the event space is really multidimensional (DA label and speaker
labels). Another motivation is that n-grams fail to model long-distance dependencies,
such as the fact that speakers may tend to repeat certain DAs or patterns throughout
the conversation.
The first alternative approach was a standard cache model (Kuhn and de Mori
1990), which boosts the probabilities of previously observed unigrams and bigrams, on
the theory that tokens tend to repeat themselves over longer distances. However, this
does not seem to be true for DA sequences in our corpus, as the cache model showed
no improvement over the standard N-gram. This result is somewhat surprising since
unigram dialogue grammars are able to detect speaker gender with 63% accuracy (over

a 50% baseline) on Switchboard (Ries 1999b), indicating that there are global variables
in the DA distribution that could potentially be exploited by a cache dialogue grammar.
Clearly, dialogue grammar adaptation needs further research.
Second, we built a discourse grammar that incorporated constraints on DA se-
quences in a nonhierarchical way, using maximum entropy (ME) estimation (Berger,
Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996). The choice of features was informed by similar
ones commonly used in statistical language models, as well our general intuitions
about potentially information-bearing elements in the discourse context. Thus, the
model was designed so that the current DA label was constrained by features such as
unigram statistics, the previous DA and the DA once removed, DAs occurring within a
window in the past, and whether the previous utterance was by the same speaker. We
found, however, that an ME model using n-gram constraints performed only slightly
better than a corresponding backoff n-gram.
Additional constraints such as DA triggers, distance-1 bigrams, separate encoding
of speaker change and bigrams to the last DA on the same/other channel did not
improve relative to the trigram model. The ME model thus confirms the adequacy of
the backoff n-gram approach, and leads us to conclude that DA sequences, at least
in the Switchboard domain, are mostly characterized by local interactions, and thus
modeled well by low-order n-gram statistics for this task. For more structured tasks this
situation might be different. However, we have found no further exploitable structure.

We now describe in more detail how the knowledge sources of words and prosody
are modeled, and what automatic DA labeling results were obtained using each of the
knowledge sources in turn. Finally, we present results for a combination of all knowl-
edge sources. DA labeling accuracy results should be compared to a baseline (chance)
accuracy of 35%, the relative frequency of the most frequent DA type (STATEMENT) in
our test set.4
5.1 Dialogue Act Classification Using Words
DA classification using words is based on the observation that different DAs use
distinctive word strings. It is known that certain cue words and phrases (Hirschberg
and Litman 1993) can serve as explicit indicators of discourse structure. Similarly,
we find distinctive correlations between certain phrases and DA types. For example,
92.4% of the uh-huh&apos;s occur in BACKCHANNELS, and 88.4% of the trigrams &amp;quot;&lt;start&gt;
do you&amp;quot; occur in YES-NO-QUESTIONS. To leverage this information source, without
hand-coding knowledge about which words are indicative of which DAs, we will use
statistical language models that model the full word sequences associated with each
DA type.
5.1.1 Classification from True Words. Assuming that the true (hand-transcribed) words
of utterances are given as evidence, we can compute word-based likelihoods P( WI U)
in a straightforward way, by building a statistical language model for each of the 42
DAs. All DAs of a particular type found in the training corpus were pooled, and
a DA-specific trigram model was estimated using standard techniques (Katz backoff
[Katz 19871 with Witten-Bell discounting [Witten and Bell 1991]).

the above approach is only a partial solution, since we are not yet able to recognize
words in spontaneous speech with perfect accuracy. A standard approach is to use
the 1-best hypothesis from the speech recognizer in place of the true word transcripts.
While conceptually simple and convenient, this method will not make optimal use of
all the information in the recognizer, which in fact maintains multiple hypotheses as
well as their relative plausibilities.
A more thorough use of recognized speech can be derived as follows. The classifi-
cation framework is modified such that the recognizer&apos;s acoustic information (spectral
features) A appear as the evidence. We compute P(A I U) by decomposing it into an
acoustic likelihood P(A I W) and a word-based likelihood P(WI U), and summing over
all word sequences:
poi = poi w, u)p(wl u)
= E poi w)p(wi (6)
The second line is justified under the assumption that the recognizer acoustics (typ-
ically, cepstral coefficients) are invariant to DA type once the words are fixed. Note
that this is another approximation in our modeling. For example, different DAs with
common words may be realized by different word pronunciations. Figure 2 shows the
Bayes network resulting from modeling recognizer acoustics through word hypothe-
ses under this independence assumption; note the added W, variables (that have to
be summed over) in comparison to Figure 1.
The acoustic likelihoods P(A I W) correspond to the acoustic scores the recognizer
outputs for every hypothesized word sequence W. The summation over all W must
be approximated; in our experiments we summed over the (up to) 2,500 best hypothe-
ses generated by the recognizer for each utterance. Care must be taken to scale the
recognizer acoustic scores properly, i.e., to exponentiate the recognizer acoustic scores
by 1/A, where A is the language model weight of the recognizer.5
5 In a standard recognizer the total log score of a hypothesis Wi is computed as
log P(A, IW) + A log P(Wi) â Wil,
where I Wil is the number of words in the hypothesis, and both A and A are parameters optimized to
minimize the word error rate. The word insertion penalty p, represents a correction to the language
model that allows balancing insertion and deletion errors. The language model weight A compensates
for acoustic score variances that are effectively too large due to severe independence assumptions in
the recognizer acoustic model. According to this rationale, it is more appropriate to divide all score
components by A. Thus, in all our experiments, we computed a summand in Equation 6 whose

ing recognizer words; this is remarkably small considering that the speech recognizer
used had a word error rate of 41% on the test set.
We also compared the n-best DA classification approach to the more straightfor-
ward 1-best approach. In this experiment, only the single best recognizer hypothesis
is used, effectively treating it as the true word string. The 1-best method increased
classification error by about 7% relative to the n-best algorithm (61.5% accuracy with

5.2 Dialogue Act Classification Using Prosody
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967272727273">
We also investigated prosodic information, i.e., information independent of the words
as well as the standard recognizer acoustics. Prosody is important for DA recogni-
tion for two reasons. First, as we saw earlier, word-based classification suffers from
recognition errors. Second, some utterances are inherently ambiguous based on words
alone. For example, some YES-No-QUESTIONS have word sequences identical to those
of STATEMENTS, but can often be distinguished by their final FO rise.
A detailed study aimed at automatic prosodic classification of DAs in the Switch-
board domain is available in a companion paper (Shriberg et al. 1998). Here we investi-
gate the interaction of prosodic models with the dialogue grammar and the word-based
DA models discussed above. We also touch briefly on alternative machine learning
models for prosodic features.

parameter values for A and p, were those used by the standard recognizer; they were not specifically

speaking rate. The gender feature that classified speakers as either male or female was
used to test for potential inadequacies in FO normalizations. Where appropriate, we
included both raw features and values normalized by utterance and/or conversation.
We also included features that are the output of the pitch accent and boundary tone

The HMM framework requires that we compute prosodic likelihoods of the form
P(F, I Lii) for each utterance Ut and associated prosodic feature values F. We have
the apparent difficulty that decision trees (as well as other classifiers, such as neural
networks) give estimates for the posterior probabilities, P(UT). The problem can be
overcome by applying Bayes&apos; rule locally:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913875">
Note that P(F) does not depend on U, and can be treated as a constant for the purpose
of DA classification. A quantity proportional to the required likelihood can therefore
be obtained either by dividing the posterior tree probability by the prior P(Ui),6 or by
training the tree on a uniform prior distribution of DA types. We chose the second
approach, downsampling our training data to equate DA proportions. This also coun-
teracts a common problem with tree classifiers trained on very skewed distributions
of target classes, i.e., that low-frequency classes are not modeled in sufficient detail
because the majority class dominates the tree-growing objective function.

tion of prosody with other knowledge sources, we trained a single tree to discriminate
among the five most frequent DA types (STATEMENT, BACKCHANNEL, OPINION, ABAN-
DONED, and AGREEMENT, totaling 79% of the data) and an Other category comprising
all remaining DA types. The decision tree was trained on a downsampled training
subset containing equal proportions of these six DA classes. The tree achieved a clas-
sification accuracy of 45.4% on an independent test set with the same uniform six-class
distribution. The chance accuracy on this set is 16.6%, so the tree clearly extracts useful
information from the prosodic features.
We then used the decision tree posteriors as scaled DA likelihoods in the dialogue
model HMM, combining it with various n-gram dialogue grammars for testing on our
full standard test set. For the purpose of model integration, the likelihoods of the Other
class were assigned to all DA types comprised by that class. As shown in Table 7, the
tree with dialogue grammar performs significantly better than chance on the raw DA
distribution, although not as well as the word-based methods (cf. Table 6).

networks compare to decision trees for the type of data studied here. Neural networks
are worth investigating since they offer potential advantages over decision trees. They
can learn decision surfaces that lie at an angle to the axes of the input feature space,
unlike standard CART trees, which always split continuous features on one dimen-
sion at a time. The response function of neural networks is continuous (smooth) at
the decision boundaries, allowing them to avoid hard decisions and the complete
fragmentation of data associated with decision tree questions.
Most important, however, related work (Ries 1999a) indicated that similarly struc-
tured networks are superior classifiers if the input features are words and are therefore
a plug-in replacement for the language model classifiers described in this paper. Neural
networks are therefore a good candidate for a jointly optimized classifier of prosodic
and word-level information since one can show that they are a generalization of the
integration approach used here.
We tested various neural network models on the same six-class downsampled
data used for decision tree training, using a variety of network architectures and out-
put layer functions. The results are summarized in Table 8, along with the baseline
result obtained with the decision tree model. Based on these experiments, a softmax
network (Bridle 1990) without hidden units resulted in only a slight improvement
over the decision tree. A network with hidden units did not afford any additional
advantage, even after we optimized the number of hidden units, indicating that com-
plex combinations of features (as far as the network could learn them) do not predict
DAs better than linear combinations of input features. While we believe alternative
classifier architectures should be investigated further as prosodic models, the results
so far seem to confirm our choice of decision trees as a model class that gives close to
optimal performance for this task.
5.2.5 Intonation Event Likelihoods. An alternative way to compute prosodically based
DA likelihoods uses pitch accents and boundary phrases (Taylor et al. 1997). The ap-
proach relies on the intuition that different utterance types are characterized by dif-
ferent intonational &amp;quot;tunes&amp;quot; (Kowtko 1996), and has been successfully applied to the
classification of move types in the DCIEM Map Task corpus (Wright and Taylor 1997).
The system detects sequences of distinctive pitch patterns by training one continuous-
density HMM for each DA type. Unfortunately, the event classification accuracy on
the Switchboard corpus was considerably poorer than in the Map Task domain, and
DA recognition results when coupled with a discourse grammar were substantially
worse than with decision trees. The approach could prove valuable in the future,
however, if the intonation event detector can be made more robust to corpora like
OUTS.

5.3 Using Multiple Knowledge Sources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998676">
As mentioned earlier, we expect improved performance from combining word and
prosodic information. Combining these knowledge sources requires estimating a com-
bined likelihood P(A1,F1111,) for each utterance. The simplest approach is to assume
that the two types of acoustic observations (recognizer acoustics and prosodic features)
are approximately conditionally independent once LI, is given:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9876525">
P(Ai, Wi,FilLIi) = P(Ai,WILIOP(F,IA1, W, Ui)
(8)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999559809523809">
Since the recognizer acoustics are modeled by way of their dependence on words, it
is particularly important to avoid using prosodic features that are directly correlated
with word identities, or features that are also modeled by the discourse grammars,
such as utterance position relative to turn changes. Figure 4 depicts the Bayes network
incorporating evidence from both word recognition and prosodic features.
One important respect in which the independence assumption is violated is in the
modeling of utterance length. While utterance length itself is not a prosodic feature,
it is an important feature to condition on when examining prosodic characteristics
of utterances, and is thus best included in the decision tree. Utterance length is cap-
tured directly by the tree using various duration measures, while the DA-specific
LMs encode the average number of words per utterance indirectly through n-gram
parameters, but still accurately enough to violate independence in a significant way
(Finke et al. 1998). As discussed in Section 8, this problem is best addressed by joint
lexical-prosodic models.
We need to allow for the fact that the models combined in Equation 8 give es-
timates of differing qualities. Therefore, we introduce an exponential weight a on
P(F, ILO that controls the contribution of the prosodic likelihood to the overall likeli-
hood. Finally, a second exponential weight /3 on the combined likelihood controls its
dynamic range relative to the discourse grammar scores, partially compensating for
any correlation between the two likelihoods. The revised combined likelihood estimate
thus becomes:

The test data was split roughly in half (without speaker overlap), each half was used

are summarized in Table 9.
As shown, the combined classifier presents a slight improvement over the rec-
ognizer-based classifier. The experiment without discourse grammar indicates that
the combined evidence is considerably stronger than either knowledge source alone,
yet this improvement seems to be made largely redundant by the use of priors and
the discourse grammar. For example, by definition DECLARATIVE-QUESTIONS are not
marked by syntax (e.g., by subject-auxiliary inversion) and are thus confusable with
STATEMENTS and OPINIONS. While prosody is expected to help disambiguate these
cases, the ambiguity can also be removed by examining the context of the utterance,
e.g., by noticing that the following utterance is a YES-ANSWER or NO-ANSWER.

5.3.2 Focused Classifications. To gain a better understanding of the potential for
prosodic DA classification independent of the effects of discourse grammar and the
skewed DA distribution in Switchboard, we examined several binary DA classification
tasks. The choice of tasks was motivated by an analysis of confusions committed by a
purely word-based DA detector, which tends to mistake QUESTIONS for STATEMENTS,
and BACKCHANNELS for AGREEMENTS (and vice versa). We tested a prosodic classifier,
a word-based classifier (with both transcribed and recognized words), and a combined
classifier on these two tasks, downsampling the DA distribution to equate the class
sizes in each case. Chance performance in all experiments is therefore 50%. Results
are summarized in Table 10.

As shown, the combined classifier was consistently more accurate than the classi-
fier using words alone. Although the gain in accuracy was not statistically significant
for the small recognizer test set because of a lack of power, replication for a larger
hand-transcribed test set showed the gain to be highly significant for both subtasks
by a Sign test, p &lt; .001 and p &lt; .0001 (one-tailed), respectively. Across these, as well
as additional subtasks, the relative advantage of adding prosody was larger for recog-
nized than for true words, suggesting that prosody is particularly helpful when word

We now consider ways to use DA modeling to enhance automatic speech recognition
(ASR). The intuition behind this approach is that discourse context constrains the
choice of DAs for a given utterance, and the DA type in turn constrains the choice of
words. The latter can then be leveraged for more accurate speech recognition.

Constraints on the word sequences hypothesized by a recognizer are expressed prob-
abilistically in the recognizer language model (LM). It provides the prior distribution
P(W) for finding the a posteriori most probable hypothesized words for an utterance,
given the acoustic evidence A, (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983):7

The likelihoods P(A,I W,) are estimated by the recognizer&apos;s acoustic model. In a stan-
dard recognizer the language model P(W) is the same for all utterances; the idea here
is to obtain better-quality LMs by conditioning on the DA type Uâ since presumably
the word distributions differ depending on DA type.

As before in the DA classification model, we tacitly assume that the words Wi depend
only on the DA of the current utterance, and also that the acoustics are independent of

readily trained from DA-specific training data, much as we did for DA classification
from words.&apos;

7 Note the similarity of Equations 10 and 1. They are identical except for the fact that we are now
operating at the level of an individual utterance, the evidence is given by the acoustics, and the targets
are word hypotheses instead of DA hypotheses.
8 In Equation 11 and elsewhere in this section we gloss over the issue of proper weighting of model
probabilities, which is extremely important in practice. The approach explained in detail in footnote 5
applies here as well.

The problem with applying Equation 11, of course, is that the DA type U, is
generally not known (except maybe in applications where the user interface can be
engineered to allow only one kind of DA for a given utterance). Therefore, we need
to infer the likely DA types for each utterance, using available evidence E from the
entire conversation. This leads to the following formulation:

<equation confidence="0.996913166666667">
WI = argmax P(Wi !Ai, E)

<bodyText confidence="0.992442409090909">
The last step in Equation 12 is justified because, as shown in Figures 1 and 4, the
evidence E (acoustics, prosody, words) pertaining to utterances other than i can affect
the current utterance only through its DA type U,.
We call this the mixture-of-posteriors approach, because it amounts to a mixture of
the posterior distributions obtained from DA-specific speech recognizers (Equation 11),
using the DA posteriors as weights. This approach is quite expensive, however, as it
requires multiple full recognizer or rescoring passes of the input, one for each DA
type.
A more efficient, though mathematically less accurate, solution can be obtained
by combining guesses about the correct DA types directly at the level of the LM. We
estimate the distribution of likely DA types for a given utterance using the entire
conversation E as evidence, and then use a sentence-level mixture (Iyer, Ostendorf,
and Rohlicek 1994) of DA-specific LMs in a single recognizer run. In other words, we
replace P(Wi I Ui) in Equation 11 with
EP(wilu)p(uilE),
a weighted mixture of all DA-specific LMs. We call this the mixture-of-LMs ap-
proach. In practice, we would first estimate DA posteriors for each utterance, us-
ing the forward-backward algorithm and the models described in Section 5, and then
rerecognize the conversation or rescore the recognizer output, using the new posterior-
weighted mixture LM. Fortunately, as shown in the next section, the mixture-of-LMs
approach seems to give results that are almost identical to (and as good as) the mixture-
of-posteriors approach.

normalizing either after or before summing over DAs. When the normalization takes
place as the final step it can be omitted for score maximization purposes; this shows
why the mixture-of-LMs approach is less computationally expensive.

6.3 Experiments and Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995">
We tested both the mixture-of-posteriors and the mixture-of-LMs approaches on our
Switchboard test set of 19 conversations. Instead of decoding the data from scratch
using the modified models, we manipulated n-best lists consisting of up to 2,500 best
hypotheses for each utterance. This approach is also convenient since both approaches
require access to the full word string for hypothesis scoring; the overall model is no
longer Markovian, and is therefore inconvenient to use in the first decoding stage, or
even in lattice rescoring.
The baseline for our experiments was obtained with a standard backoff trigram
language model estimated from all available training data. The DA-specific language
models were trained on word transcripts of all the training utterances of a given type,
and then smoothed further by interpolating them with the baseline LM. Each DA-
specific LM used its own interpolation weight, obtained by minimizing the perplexity
of the interpolated model on held-out DA-specific training data. Note that this smooth-
ing step is helpful when using the DA-specific LMs for word recognition, but not for
DA classification, since it renders the DA-specific LMs less discriminative.&apos;
Table 11 summarizes both the word error rates achieved with the various models
and the perplexities of the corresponding LMs used in the rescoring (note that per-
plexity is not meaningful in the mixture-of-posteriors approach). For comparison, we
also included two additional models: the &amp;quot;1-best LM&amp;quot; refers to always using the DA-
specific LM corresponding to the most probable DA type for each utterance. It is thus
an approximation to both mixture approaches where only the top DA is considered.
Second, we included an &amp;quot;oracle LM,&amp;quot; i.e., always using the LM that corresponds to
the hand-labeled DA for each utterance. The purpose of this experiment was to give us
an upper bound on the effectiveness of the mixture approaches, by assuming perfect
DA recognition.
It was somewhat disappointing that the word error rate (WER) improvement in
the oracle experiment was small (2.2% relative), even though statistically highly sig-
nificant (p &lt; .0001, one-tailed, according to a Sign test on matched utterance pairs).

The WER reduction achieved with the mixture-of-LMs approach did not achieve sta-
tistical significance (0.25 &gt; p &gt; 0.20). The 1-best DA and the two mixture models
also did not differ significantly on this test set. In interpreting these results one must
realize, however, that WER results depend on a complex combination of factors, most
notably interaction between language models and the acoustic models. Since the ex-
periments only varied the language models used in rescoring, it is also informative to
compare the quality of these models as reflected by perplexity. On this measure, we
see a substantial 13% (relative) reduction, which is achieved by both the oracle and
the mixture-of-LMs. The perplexity reduction for the 1-best LM is only 9.8%, showing
the advantage of the mixture approach.
To better understand the lack of a more substantial reduction in word error, we an-
alyzed the effect of the DA-conditioned rescoring on the individual DAs, i.e., grouping
the test utterances by their true DA types. Table 12 shows the WER improvements for
a few DA types, ordered by the magnitude of improvement achieved. As shown, all
frequent DA types saw improvement, but the highest wins were observed for typically
short DAs, such as ANSWERS and BACKCHANNELS. This is to be expected, as such DAs
tend to be syntactically and lexically highly constrained. Furthermore, the distribution
of number of words across DA types is very uneven (Figure 5). STATEMENTS and
OPINIONS, the DA types dominating in both frequency and number of words (83% of
total), see no more than 0.5% absolute improvement, thus explaining the small overall
improvement. In hindsight, this is also not surprising, since the bulk of the training
data for the baseline LM consists of these DAs, allowing only little improvement in

recognition errors can be found elsewhere (Van Ess-Dykema and Ries 1998).
In summary, our experiments confirmed that DA modeling can improve word
recognition accuracy quite substantially in principle, at least for certain DA types,
but that the skewed distribution of DAs (especially in terms of number of words per
type) limits the usefulness of the approach on the Switchboard corpus. The benefits
of DA modeling might therefore be more pronounced on corpora with more even
DA distribution, as is typically the case for task-oriented dialogues. Task-oriented
dialogues might also feature specific subtypes of general DA categories that might
be constrained by discourse. Prior research on task-oriented dialogues summarized in
the next section, however, has also found only small reductions in WER (on the order
of 1%). This suggests that even in task-oriented domains more research is needed to
realize the potential of DA modeling for ASR.

7. Prior and Related Work
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983">
As indicated in the introduction, our work builds on a number of previous efforts
in computational discourse modeling and automatic discourse processing, most of
which occurred over the last half-decade. It is generally not possible to directly com-
pare quantitative results because of vast differences in methodology, tag set, type and
amount of training data, and, principally, assumptions made about what information
is available for &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; (e.g., hand-transcribed versus automatically recognized words,
or segmented versus unsegmented utterances). Thus, we will focus on the conceptual
aspects of previous research efforts, and while we do offer a summary of previous
quantitative results, these should be interpreted as informative datapoints only, and
not as fair comparisons between algorithms.
Previous research on DA modeling has generally focused on task-oriented dia-
logue, with three tasks in particular garnering much of the research effort. The Map
Task corpus (Anderson et al. 1991; Bard et al. 1995) consists of conversations between
two speakers with slightly different maps of an imaginary territory. Their task is to
help one speaker reproduce a route drawn only on the other speaker&apos;s map, all with-
out being able to see each other&apos;s maps. Of the DA modeling algorithms described
below, Taylor et al. (1998) and Wright (1998) were based on Map Task. The VERBMO-
BIL corpus consists of two-party scheduling dialogues. A number of the DA modeling
algorithms described below were developed for VERBMOBIL, including those of Mast
et al. (1996), Warnke et al. (1997), Reithinger et al. (1996), Reithinger and Klesen (1997),
and Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998). The ATR Conference corpus is a sub-
set of a larger ATR Dialogue database consisting of simulated dialogues between a
secretary and a questioner at international conferences. Researchers using this corpus
include Nagata (1992), Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994), and Kita et al. (1996). Ta-
ble 13 shows the most commonly used versions of the tag sets from those three tasks.
As discussed earlier, these domains differ from the Switchboard corpus in being
task-oriented. Their tag sets are also generally smaller, but some of the same problems
of balance occur. For example, in the Map Task domain, 33% of the words occur in 1
of the 12 DAs (iNsTRucT). Table 14 shows the approximate size of the corpora, the tag
set, and tag estimation accuracy rates for various recent models of DA prediction. The
results summarized in the table also illustrate the differences in inherent difficulty of
the tasks. For example, the task of Warnke et al. (1997) was to simultaneously segment
and tag DAs, whereas the other results rely on a prior manual segmentation. Similarly,
the task in Wright (1998) and in our study was to determine DA types from speech
input, whereas work by others is based on hand-transcribed textual input.

The use of n-grams to model the probabilities of DA sequences, or to predict
upcoming DAs on-line, has been proposed by many authors. It seems to have been
first employed by Nagata (1992), and in follow-up papers by Nagata and Morimoto
(1993, 1994) on the ATR Dialogue database. The model predicted upcoming DAs by
using bigrams and trigrams conditioned on preceding DAs, trained on a corpus of
2,722 DAs. Many others subsequently relied on and enhanced this n-grams-of-DAs
approach, often by applying standard techniques from statistical language modeling.
Reithinger et al. (1996), for example, used deleted interpolation to smooth the dialogue
n-grams. Chu-Carroll (1998) uses knowledge of subdialogue structure to selectively
skip previous DAs in choosing conditioning for DA prediction.
Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) may also have been the first to use word n-
grams as a miniature grammar for DAs, to be used in improving speech recognition.
The idea caught on very quickly: Suhm and Waibel (1994), Mast et al. (1996), Warnke
et al. (1997), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Taylor et al. (1998) all use variants of
backoff, interpolated, or class n-gram language models to estimate DA likelihoods. Any
kind of sufficiently powerful, trainable language model could perform this function, of
course, and indeed Alexandersson and Reithinger (1997) propose using automatically
learned stochastic context-free grammars. Jurafsky, Shriberg, Fox, and Curl (1998) show
that the grammar of some DAs, such as appreciations, can be captured by finite-state
automata over part-of-speech tags.
N-gram models are likelihood models for DAs, i.e., they compute the conditional
probabilities of the word sequence given the DA type. Word-based posterior probability
estimators are also possible, although less common. Mast et al. (1996) propose the use
of semantic classification trees, a kind of decision tree conditioned on word patterns
as features. Finally, Ries (1999a) shows that neural networks using only unigram fea-
tures can be superior to higher-order n-gram DA models. Warnke et al. (1999) and
Ohler, Harbeck, and Niemann (1999) use related discriminative training algorithms
for language models.
Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) and Suhm and Waibel (1994), followed by Chu-
Carroll (1998), seem to have been the first to note that such a combination of word
and dialogue n-grams could be viewed as a dialogue HMM with word strings as
the observations. (Indeed, with the exception of Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker
(1998), all models listed in Table 14 rely on some version of this HMM metaphor.)
Some researchers explicitly used HMM induction techniques to infer dialogue gram-
mars. Woszczyna and Waibel (1994), for example, trained an ergodic HMM using
expectation-maximization to model speech act sequencing. Kita et al. (1996) made
one of the few attempts at unsupervised discovery of dialogue structure, where a
finite-state grammar induction algorithm is used to find the topology of the dialogue
grammar.
Computational approaches to prosodic modeling of DAs have aimed to auto-
matically extract various prosodic parametersâsuch as duration, pitch, and energy
patternsâfrom the speech signal (Yoshimura et al. [1996]; Taylor et al. [1997]; Kompe
[1997], among others). Some approaches model FO patterns with techniques such as
vector quantization and Gaussian classifiers to help disambiguate utterance types. An
extensive comparison of the prosodic DA modeling literature with our work can be
found in Shriberg et al. (1998).
DA modeling has mostly been geared toward automatic DA classification, and
much less work has been done on applying DA models to automatic speech recog-
nition. Nagata and Morimoto (1994) suggest conditioning word language models on
DAs to lower perplexity. Suhm and Waibel (1994) and Eckert, Gallwitz, and Niemann
(1996) each condition a recognizer LM on left-to-right DA predictions and are able to

show reductions in word error rate of 1% on task-oriented corpora. Most similar to
our own work, but still in a task-oriented domain, the work by Taylor et al. (1998)
combines DA likelihoods from prosodic models with those from 1-best recognition
output to condition the recognizer LM, again achieving an absolute reduction in word
error rate of 1%, as disappointing as the 0.3% improvement in our experiments.
Related computational tasks beyond DA classification and speech recognition have
received even less attention to date. We already mentioned Warnke et al. (1997) and
Finke et al. (1998), who both showed that utterance segmentation and classification can
be integrated into a single search process. Fukada et al. (1998) investigate augmenting
DA tagging with more detailed semantic &amp;quot;concept&amp;quot; tags, as a preliminary step toward
an interlingua-based dialogue translation system. Levin et al. (1999) couple DA clas-
sification with dialogue game classification; dialogue games are units above the DA
level, i.e., short DA sequences such as question-answer pairs.
All the work mentioned so far uses statistical models of various kinds. As we have
shown here, such models offer some fundamental advantages, such as modularity and
composability (e.g., of discourse grammars with DA models) and the ability to deal
with noisy input (e.g., from a speech recognizer) in a principled way. However, many
other classifier architectures are applicable to the tasks discussed, in particular to DA
classification. A nonprobabilistic approach for DA labeling proposed by Samuel, Car-
berry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998) is transformation-based learning (Brill 1993). Finally
it should be noted that there are other tasks with a mathematical structure similar to
that of DA tagging, such as shallow parsing for natural language processing (Munk
1999) and DNA classification tasks (Ohler, Harbeck, and Niemann 1999), from which
further techniques could be borrowed.
How does the approach presented here differ from these various earlier models,
particularly those based on HMMs? Apart from corpus and tag set differences, our
approach differs primarily in that it generalizes the simple HMM approach to cope
with new kinds of problems, based on the Bayes network representations depicted in
Figures 2 and 4. For the DA classification task, our framework allows us to do classifi-
cation given unreliable words (by marginalizing over the possible word strings corre-
sponding to the acoustic input) and given nonlexical (e.g., prosodic) evidence. For the
speech recognition task, the generalized model gives a clean probabilistic framework
for conditioning word probabilities on the conversation context via the underlying DA
structure. Unlike previous models that did not address speech recognition or relied
only on an intuitive 1-best approximation, our model allows computation of the opti-
mum word sequence by effectively summing over all possible DA sequences as well
as all recognition hypotheses throughout the conversation, using evidence from both
past and future.
8. Discussion and Issues for Future Research
Our approach to dialogue modeling has two major components: statistical dialogue
grammars modeling the sequencing of DAs, and DA likelihood models expressing
the local cues (both lexical and prosodic) for DAs. We made a number of significant
simplifications to arrive at a computationally and statistically tractable formulation.
In this formulation, DAs serve as the hinges that join the various model components,
but also decouple these components through statistical independence assumptions.
Conditional on the DAs, the observations across utterances are assumed to be inde-
pendent, and evidence of different kinds from the same utterance (e.g., lexical and
prosodic) is assumed to be independent. Finally, DA types themselves are assumed
to be independent beyond a short span (corresponding to the order of the dialogue

<bodyText confidence="0.999453975609756">
n-gram). Further research within this framework can be characterized by which of
these simplifications are addressed.
Dialogue grammars for conversational speech need to be made more aware of the
temporal properties of utterances. For example, we are currently not modeling the fact
that utterances by the conversants may actually overlap (e.g., backchannels interrupt-
ing an ongoing utterance). In addition, we should model more of the nonlocal aspects
of discourse structure, despite our negative results so far. For example, a context-free
discourse grammar could potentially account for the nested structures proposed in
Grosz and Sidner (1986).&apos;
The standard n-gram models for DA discrimination with lexical cues are probably
suboptimal for this task, simply because they are trained in the maximum likelihood
framework, without explicitly optimizing discrimination between DA types. This may
be overcome by using discriminative training procedures (Warnke et al. 1999; Ohler,
Harbeck, and Niemann 1999). Training neural networks directly with posterior prob-
ability (Ries 1999a) seems to be a more principled approach and it also offers much
easier integration with other knowledge sources. Prosodic features, for example, can
simply be added to the lexical features, allowing the model to capture dependencies
and redundancies across knowledge sources. Keyword-based techniques from the field
of message classification should also be applicable here (Rose, Chang, and Lippmann
1991). Eventually, it is desirable to integrate dialogue grammar, lexical, and prosodic
cues into a single model, e.g., one that predicts the next DA based on DA history and
all the local evidence.
The study of automatically extracted prosodic features for DA modeling is likewise
only in its infancy. Our preliminary experiments with neural networks have shown that
small gains are obtainable with improved statistical modeling techniques. However,
we believe that more progress can be made by improving the underlying features
themselves, in terms of both better understanding of how speakers use them, and
ways to reliably extract them from data.
Regarding the data itself, we saw that the distribution of DAs in our corpus limits
the benefit of DA modeling for lower-level processing, in particular speech recognition.
The reason for the skewed distribution was in the nature of the task (or lack thereof) in
Switchboard. It remains to be seen if more fine-grained DA distinctions can be made
reliably in this corpus. However, it should be noted that the DA definitions are really
arbitrary as far as tasks other than DA labeling are concerned. This suggests using
unsupervised, self-organizing learning schemes that choose their own DA definitions
in the process of optimizing the primary task, whatever it may be. Hand-labeled DA
categories may still serve an important role in initializing such an algorithm.
We believe that dialogue-related tasks have much to benefit from corpus-driven,
automatic learning techniques. To enable such research, we need fairly large, stan-
dardized corpora that allow comparisons over time and across approaches. Despite
its shortcomings, the Switchboard domain could serve this purpose.

grammar. All components of the model are automatically trained, and are thus appli-
cable to other domains for which labeled data is available. Classification accuracies
achieved so far are highly encouraging, relative to the inherent difficulty of the task as
measured by human labeler performance. We investigated several modeling alterna-
tives for the components of the model (backoff n-grams and maximum entropy models
for discourse grammars, decision trees and neural networks for prosodic classification)
and found performance largely independent of these choices. Finally, we developed a
principled way of incorporating DA modeling into the probability model of a contin-
uous speech recognizer, by constraining word hypotheses using the discourse context.
However, the approach gives only a small reduction in word error on our corpus,
which can be attributed to a preponderance of a single dialogue act type (statements).

<abstract confidence="0.997181125">We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speechunits such QUESTION, BACKCHANNEL, AGREEMENT, DISAGREEmodel detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence. The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act. We develop a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue modeling, to improve both speech recognition and dialogue act classification accuracy. Models are trained and evaluated using a large hand-labeled database of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous human-to-human telephone speech. We achieved good dialogue act labeling accuracy (65% based on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody, and 71% based on word transcripts, compared to a chance baseline accuracy of 35% and human accuracy of 84%) and a small reduction in word recognition error.</abstract>

Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) may also have been the first to use word ngrams as a miniature grammar for DAs, to be used in improving speech recognition. The idea caught on very quickly: Suhm and Waibel (1994), Mast et al. (1996), Warnke et al. (1997), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Taylor et al. (1998) all use variants of backoff, interpolated, or class n-gram language models to estimate DA likelihoods. Any kind of sufficiently powerful, trainable language model could perform this function, of course, and indeed Alexandersson and Reithinger (1997) propose using automatically learned stochastic context-free grammars. Jurafsky, Shriberg, Fox, and Curl (1998) show that the grammar of some DAs, such as appreciations, can be captured by finite-state automata over part-of-speech tags. N-gram models are likelihood models for DAs, i.e., they compute the conditional probabilities of the word sequence given the DA type. Word-based posterior probability estimators are also possible, although less common. Mast et al. (1996) propose the use of semantic classification trees, a kind of decision tree conditioned on word patterns as features. Finally, </context>

Introduction The ability to model and automatically detect discourse structure is an important step toward understanding spontaneous dialogue. While there is hardly consensus on exactly how discourse structure should be described, some agreement exists that a useful first level of analysis involves the identification of dialogue acts (DAs). A DA represents the meaning of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force (Austin 1962). Thus, a DA is approximately the equivalent of the speech act of Searle (1969), the conversational game move of Power (1979), or the adjacency pair part of Schegloff (1968) and Saks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974). Table 1 shows a sample of the kind of discourse structure in which we are interested. Each utterance is assigned a unique DA label (shown in column 2), drawn from a well-defined set (shown in Table 2). Thus, DAs can be thought of as a tag set that classifies utterances according to a combination of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic criteria. The computational community has usuall</context>

However, for higher-order discourse grammars we found that forward-backward decoding consistently gives slightly (up to 1% absolute) better accuracies, as expected. Therefore, we used this method throughout. The formulation presented here, as well as all our experiments, uses the entire conversation as evidence for DA classification.

Decision trees allow the combination of discrete and continuous features, and can be inspected to help in understanding the role of different features and feature combinations. To illustrate one area in which prosody could aid our classification task, we applied trees to DA classifications known to be ambiguous from words alone.

Neural networks are therefore a good candidate for a jointly optimized classifier of prosodic and word-level information since one can show that they are a generalization of the integration approach used here. We tested various neural network models on the same six-class downsampled data used for decision tree training, using a variety of network architectures and output layer functions. The results are summarized in Table 8, along with the baseline result obtained with the decision tree model. Based on these experiments, a softmax network (Bridle 1990) without hidden units resulted in only a slight improvement over the decision tree. A network with hidden units did not afford any additional advantage, even after we optimized the number of hidden units, indicating that complex combinations of features (as far as the network could learn them) do not predict DAs better than linear combinations of input features. While we believe alternative classifier architectures should be investigated further as prosodic models, the results so far seem to confirm our choice of decision trees as a model class that gives close to optimal performance for this </context>

As we have shown here, such models offer some fundamental advantages, such as modularity and composability (e.g., of discourse grammars with DA models) and the ability to deal with noisy input (e.g., from a speech recognizer) in a principled way. However, many other classifier architectures are applicable to the tasks discussed, in particular to DA classification. A nonprobabilistic approach for DA labeling proposed by Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998) is transformation-based learning (Brill 1993). Finally it should be noted that there are other tasks with a mathematical structure similar to that of DA tagging, such as shallow parsing for natural language processing (Munk 1999) and DNA classification tasks (Ohler, Harbeck, and Niemann 1999), from which further techniques could be borrowed. How does the approach presented here differ from these various earlier models, particularly those based on HMMs? Apart from corpus and tag set differences, our approach differs primarily in that it generalizes the simple HMM approach to cope with new kinds of problems, based on the Bayes network repr</context>

Interlabeler agreement for the 42-label tag set used here was 84%, resulting in a Kappa statistic of 0.80. The Kappa statistic measures agreement normalized for chance (Siegel and Castellan, Jr. 1988). As argued in Carletta (1996), Kappa values of 0.8 or higher are desirable for detecting associations between several coded variables; we were thus satisfied with the level of agreement achieved. (Note that, even though only a single variable, DA type, was coded for the present study, our goal is, among other things, to model associations between several instances of that variable, e.g., between adjacent DAs.)

In related work DAs are used as a first processing step to infer dialogue games (Carlson 1983; Levin and Moore 1977; Levin et al. 1999), a slightly higher level unit that comprises a small number of DAs. Interactional dominance (Linell 1990) might be measured more accurately using DA distributions than with simpler techniques, and could serve as an indicator of the type or genre of discourse at hand. In all these cases, DA labels would enrich the available input for higher-level processing of the spoken words. Another important role of DA information could be feedback to lower-level processing.

It seems to have been first employed by Nagata (1992), and in follow-up papers by Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) on the ATR Dialogue database. The model predicted upcoming DAs by using bigrams and trigrams conditioned on preceding DAs, trained on a corpus of 2,722 DAs. Many others subsequently relied on and enhanced this n-grams-of-DAs approach, often by applying standard techniques from statistical language modeling. Reithinger et al. (1996), for example, used deleted interpolation to smooth the dialogue n-grams. Chu-Carroll (1998) uses knowledge of subdialogue structure to selectively skip previous DAs in choosing conditioning for DA prediction. Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) may also have been the first to use word ngrams as a miniature grammar for DAs, to be used in improving speech recognition. The idea caught on very quickly: Suhm and Waibel (1994), Mast et al. (1996), Warnke et al. (1997), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Taylor et al.

The computational community has usually defined these DA categories so as to be relevant to a particular application, although efforts are under way to develop DA labeling systems that are domain-independent, such as the Discourse Resource Initiative&apos;s DAMSL architecture (Core and Allen 1997).

An important consequence of this decision is that we can expect utterance length and acoustic properties at utterance boundaries to be accurate, both of which turn out to be important features of DAs (Shriberg et al. 1998; see also Section 5.2.1). 2.2 Tag Set We chose to follow a recent standard for shallow discourse structure annotation, the Dialog Act Markup in Several Layers (DAMSL) tag set, which was designed by the natural language processing community under the auspices of the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core and Allen 1997). We began with the DAMSL markup system, but modified it in several ways to make it more relevant to our corpus and task. DAMSL aims to provide a domain-independent framework for dialogue annotation, as reflected by the fact that our tag set can be mapped back to DAMSL categories (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca 1997). However, our labeling effort also showed that content- and task-related distinctions will always play an important role in effective DA labeling.

(1999) couple DA classification with dialogue game classification; dialogue games are units above the DA level, i.e., short DA sequences such as question-answer pairs. All the work mentioned so far uses statistical models of various kinds. As we have shown here, such models offer some fundamental advantages, such as modularity and composability (e.g., of discourse grammars with DA models) and the ability to deal with noisy in</context>

Dialogue grammars for conversational speech need to be made more aware of the temporal properties of utterances. For example, we are currently not modeling the fact that utterances by the conversants may actually overlap (e.g., backchannels interrupting an ongoing utterance). In addition, we should model more of the nonlocal aspects of discourse structure, despite our negative results so far. For example, a context-free discourse grammar could potentially account for the nested structures proposed in Grosz and Sidner (1986).&apos; The standard n-gram models for DA discrimination with lexical cues are probably suboptimal for this task, simply because they are trained in the maximum likelihood framework, without explicitly optimizing discrimination between DA types. This may be overcome by using discriminative training procedures (Warnke et al. 1999; Ohler, Harbeck, and Niemann 1999). Training neural networks directly with posterior probability (Ries 1999a) seems to be a more principled approach and it also offers much easier integration with other knowledge sources.

A backchannel is a short utterance that plays discourse-structuring roles, e.g., indicating that the speaker should go on talking. These are usually referred to in the conversation analysis literature as &amp;quot;continuers&amp;quot; and have been studied extensively (Jefferson 1984; Schegloff 1982; Yngve 1970). We expect recognition of backchannels to be useful because of their discourse-structuring role (knowing that the hearer expects the speaker to go on talking tells us something about the course of the narrative) and because they seem to occur at certain kinds of syntactic boundaries; detecting a backchannel may thus help in predicting utterance boundaries and surrounding lexical material. For an intuition about what backchannels look like, Table 3 shows the most common realizations of the approximately 300 types (35,827 tokens) of backchannel in our Switchboard su</context>

(1996), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998). The ATR Conference corpus is a subset of a larger ATR Dialogue database consisting of simulated dialogues between a secretary and a questioner at international conferences. Researchers using this corpus include Nagata (1992), Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994), and Kita et al. (1996). Table 13 shows the most commonly used versions of the tag sets from those three tasks. As discussed earlier, these domains differ from the Switchboard corpus in being task-oriented. Their tag sets are also generally smaller, but some of the same problems of balance occur. For example, in the Map Task domain, 33% of the words occur in 1 of the 12 DAs (iNsTRucT).

(Indeed, with the exception of Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998), all models listed in Table 14 rely on some version of this HMM metaphor.) Some researchers explicitly used HMM induction techniques to infer dialogue grammars. Woszczyna and Waibel (1994), for example, trained an ergodic HMM using expectation-maximization to model speech act sequencing. Kita et al. (1996) made one of the few attempts at unsupervised discovery of dialogue structure, where a finite-state grammar induction algorithm is used to find the topology of the dialogue grammar. Computational approaches to prosodic modeling of DAs have aimed to automatically extract various prosodic parametersâsuch as duration, pitch, and energy patternsâfrom the speech signal (Yoshimura et al.

While we believe alternative classifier architectures should be investigated further as prosodic models, the results so far seem to confirm our choice of decision trees as a model class that gives close to optimal performance for this task. 5.2.5 Intonation Event Likelihoods. An alternative way to compute prosodically based DA likelihoods uses pitch accents and boundary phrases (Taylor et al. 1997). The approach relies on the intuition that different utterance types are characterized by different intonational &amp;quot;tunes&amp;quot; (Kowtko 1996), and has been successfully applied to the classification of move types in the DCIEM Map Task corpus (Wright and Taylor 1997). The system detects sequences of distinctive pitch patterns by training one continuousdensity HMM for each DA type. Unfortunately, the event classification accuracy on the Switchboard corpus was considerably poorer than in the Map Task domain, and DA recognition results when coupled with a discourse grammar were substantially worse than with decision trees. The approach could prove valuable in the future, however, if the intonation event detector can be made more robust</context>

While not constituting dialogue understanding in any deep sense, DA tagging seems clearly useful to a range of applications. For example, a meeting summarizer needs to keep track of who said what to whom, and a conversational agent needs to know whether it was asked a question or ordered to do something. In related work DAs are used as a first processing step to infer dialogue games (Carlson 1983; Levin and Moore 1977; Levin et al. 1999), a slightly higher level unit that comprises a small number of DAs. Interactional dominance (Linell 1990) might be measured more accurately using DA distributions than with simpler techniques, and could serve as an indicator of the type or genre of discourse at hand. In all these cases, DA labels would enrich the available input for higher-level processing of the spoken words. Another important role of DA information could be feedback to lower-level processing. For example, a speech recognizer could be constrained by expectations of likely DAs in a given context, constrain</context>

Interactional dominance (Linell 1990) might be measured more accurately using DA distributions than with simpler techniques, and could serve as an indicator of the type or genre of discourse at hand. In all these cases, DA labels would enrich the available input for higher-level processing of the spoken words. Another important role of DA information could be feedback to lower-level processing.

Related computational tasks beyond DA classification and speech recognition have received even less attention to date. We already mentioned Warnke et al. (1997) and Finke et al. (1998), who both showed that utterance segmentation and classification can be integrated into a single search process. Fukada et al. (1998) investigate augmenting DA tagging with more detailed semantic &amp;quot;concept&amp;quot; tags, as a preliminary step toward an interlingua-based dialogue translation system. Levin et al. (1999) couple DA classification with dialogue game classification; dialogue games are units above the DA level, i.e., short DA sequences such as question-answer pairs. All the work mentioned so far uses statistical models of various kinds. As we have shown here, such models offer some fundamental advantages, such as modularity and composability (e.g., of discourse grammars with DA models) and the ability to deal with noisy input (e.g., from a speech recognizer) in a principled way. However, many other classifier architectures are applicable to the tasks discussed, in particular to DA classification.</context>

The relation between utterances and speaker turns is not one-to-one: a single turn can contain multiple utterances, and utterances can span more than one turn (e.g., in the case of backchanneling by the other speaker in midutterance). Each utterance unit was identified with one DA, and was annotated with a single DA label. The DA labeling system had special provisions for rare cases where utterances seemed to combine aspects of several DA types. Automatic segmentation of spontaneous speech is an open research problem in its own right (Mast et al. 1996; Stolcke and Shriberg 1996). A rough idea of the difficulty of the segmentation problem on this corpus and using the same definition of utterance units can be derived from a recent study (Shriberg et al. 2000). In an automatic labeling 342 Stolcke et al.

Their task is to help one speaker reproduce a route drawn only on the other speaker&apos;s map, all without being able to see each other&apos;s maps. Of the DA modeling algorithms described below, Taylor et al. (1998) and Wright (1998) were based on Map Task. The VERBMOBIL corpus consists of two-party scheduling dialogues. A number of the DA modeling algorithms described below were developed for VERBMOBIL, including those of Mast et al. (1996), Warnke et al. (1997), Reithinger et al.

Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) may also have been the first to use word ngrams as a miniature grammar for DAs, to be used in improving speech recognition. The idea caught on very quickly: Suhm and Waibel (1994), Mast et al. (1996), Warnke et al. (1997), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Taylor et al. (1998) all use variants of backoff, interpolated, or class n-gram language models to estimate DA likelihoods. Any kind of sufficiently powerful, trainable language model could perform this function, of course, and indeed Alexandersson and Reithinger (1997) propose using automatically learned stochastic context-free grammars. Jurafsky, Shriberg, Fox, and Curl (1998) show that the grammar of some DAs, such as appreciations, can be captured by finite-state automata over part-of-speech tags.

To expedite the DA labeling task and remain consistent with other Switchboard-based research efforts, we made use of a version of the corpus that had been hand-segmented into sentence-level units prior to our own work and independently of our DA labeling system (Meteer et al. 1995). We refer to the units of this segmentation as utterances. The relation between utterances and speaker turns is not one-to-one: a single turn can contain multiple utterances, and utterances can span more than one turn (e.g., in the case of backchanneling by the other speaker in midutterance).

However, many other classifier architectures are applicable to the tasks discussed, in particular to DA classification. A nonprobabilistic approach for DA labeling proposed by Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998) is transformation-based learning (Brill 1993). Finally it should be noted that there are other tasks with a mathematical structure similar to that of DA tagging, such as shallow parsing for natural language processing (Munk 1999) and DNA classification tasks (Ohler, Harbeck, and Niemann 1999), from which further techniques could be borrowed. How does the approach presented here differ from these various earlier models, particularly those based on HMMs? Apart from corpus and tag set differences, our approach differs primarily in that it generalizes the simple HMM approach to cope with new kinds of problems, based on the Bayes network representations depicted in Figures 2 and 4. For the DA classification task, our framework allows us to do classification given unreliable words (by marginalizing over the possible word st</context>

However, our framework generalizes earlier models, giving us a clean probabilistic approach for performing DA classification from unreliable words and nonlexical evidence. For the 341 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 3 speech recognition task, our framework provides a mathematically principled way to condition the speech recognizer on conversation context through dialogue structure, as well as on nonlexical information correlated with DA identity.

An extensive comparison of the prosodic DA modeling literature with our work can be found in Shriberg et al. (1998). DA modeling has mostly been geared toward automatic DA classification, and much less work has been done on applying DA models to automatic speech recognition.

The importance of the Markov assumption for the discourse grammar is that we can now view the whole system of discourse grammar and local utterance-based likelihoods as a kth-order hidden Markov model (HMM) (Rabiner and juang 1986). The HMM states correspond to DAs, observations correspond to utterances, transition probabilities are given by the discourse grammar (see Section 4), and observation probabilities are given by the local likelihoods P(EilU,). We can represent the dependency structure (as well as the implied conditional independences) as a special case of Bayesian belief network (Pearl 1988). Figure 1 shows the variables in the resulting HMM with directed edges representing conditional dependence. To keep things simple, a first-order HMM (bigram discourse grammar) is assumed. 3.3 Dialogue Act Decoding The HMM representation allows us to use efficient dynamic programming algorithms to compute relevant aspects of the model, such as â¢ the most probable DA sequence (the Viterbi algorithm) â¢ the posterior probability of various DAs for a given utterance, after considering all the evidence (the forward-backward algorithm) The Viterbi algorithm for HMMs (Viterbi 1967) finds the globally</context>

Our discourse grammars thus had a vocabulary of 42 x 2 = 84 labels, plus tags for the beginning and end of conversations. For example, the second DA tag in Table 1 would be predicted by a trigram discourse grammar using the fact that the same speaker previously uttered a YES-No-QUESTION, which in turn was preceded by the start-of-conversation. 3 We note in passing that the Viterbi and Baum algorithms have equivalent formulations in the Bayes network framework (Pearl 1988).

Introduction The ability to model and automatically detect discourse structure is an important step toward understanding spontaneous dialogue. While there is hardly consensus on exactly how discourse structure should be described, some agreement exists that a useful first level of analysis involves the identification of dialogue acts (DAs). A DA represents the meaning of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force (Austin 1962). Thus, a DA is approximately the equivalent of the speech act of Searle (1969), the conversational game move of Power (1979), or the adjacency pair part of Schegloff (1968) and Saks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974). Table 1 shows a sample of the kind of discourse structure in which we are interested. Each utterance is assigned a unique DA label (shown in column 2), drawn from a well-defined set (shown in Table 2). Thus, DAs can be thought of as a tag set that classifies utterances according to a combination of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic criteria. The computational community has usually defined these DA categories so as to be relevant to a particular application, although efforts are under way to develop DA </context>

It seems to have been first employed by Nagata (1992), and in follow-up papers by Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) on the ATR Dialogue database. The model predicted upcoming DAs by using bigrams and trigrams conditioned on preceding DAs, trained on a corpus of 2,722 DAs. Many others subsequently relied on and enhanced this n-grams-of-DAs approach, often by applying standard techniques from statistical language modeling. Reithinger et al.

Chu-Carroll (1998) uses knowledge of subdialogue structure to selectively skip previous DAs in choosing conditioning for DA prediction.

The first alternative approach was a standard cache model (Kuhn and de Mori 1990), which boosts the probabilities of previously observed unigrams and bigrams, on the theory that tokens tend to repeat themselves over longer distances. However, this does not seem to be true for DA sequences in our corpus, as the cache model showed no improvement over the standard N-gram. This result is somewhat surprising since unigram dialogue grammars are able to detect speaker gender with 63% accuracy (over 350 Stolcke et al.

Table 1 shows a sample of the kind of discourse structure in which we are interested. Each utterance is assigned a unique DA label (shown in column 2), drawn from a well-defined set (shown in Table 2). Thus, DAs can be thought of as a tag set that classifies utterances according to a combination of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic criteria. The computational community has usually defined these DA categories so as to be relevant to a particular application, although efforts are under way to develop DA labeling systems that are domain-independent, su</context>

(This observation, initially based on perplexity, is confirmed by the DA tagging experiments reported in Section 5.) Comparing P(U) and P(UIT), we see that speaker identity adds substantial information, especially for higher-order models. The relatively small improvements from higher-order models could be a result of lack of training data, or of an inherent independence of DAs from DAs further removed. The near-optimality of the bigram discourse grammar is plausible given conversation analysis accounts of discourse structure in terms of adjacency pairs (Schegloff 1968; Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974). Inspection of bigram probabilities estimated from our data revealed that conventional adjacency pairs receive high probabilities, as expected. For example, 30% of YES-NO-QUESTIONS are followed by YES-ANSWERS, 14% by NO-ANSWERS (confirming that the latter are dispreferred). COMMANDS are followed by AGREEMENTS in 23% of the cases, and STATEMENTS elicit BACKCHANNELS in 26% of all cases. 4.2 Other Discourse Models We also investigated non-n-gram discourse models, based on various language modeling techniques known from speech recognition.

A backchannel is a short utterance that plays discourse-structuring roles, e.g., indicating that the speaker should go on talking. These are usually referred to in the conversation analysis literature as &amp;quot;continuers&amp;quot; and have been studied extensively (Jefferson 1984; Schegloff 1982; Yngve 1970). We expect recognition of backchannels to be useful because of their discourse-structuring role (knowing that the hearer expects the speaker to go on talking tells us something about the course of the narrative) and because they seem to occur at certain kinds of syntactic boundaries; detecting a backchannel may thus help in predicting utterance boundaries and surrounding lexical material. For an intuition about what backchannels look like, Table 3 shows the most common realizations of the approximately 300 types (35,827 tokens) of backchannel in our Switchboard subset.

Introduction The ability to model and automatically detect discourse structure is an important step toward understanding spontaneous dialogue. While there is hardly consensus on exactly how discourse structure should be described, some agreement exists that a useful first level of analysis involves the identification of dialogue acts (DAs). A DA represents the meaning of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force (Austin 1962). Thus, a DA is approximately the equivalent of the speech act of Searle (1969), the conversational game move of Power (1979), or the adjacency pair part of Schegloff (1968) and Saks, Schegloff, and Jefferson (1974).

Many others subsequently relied on and enhanced this n-grams-of-DAs approach, often by applying standard techniques from statistical language modeling. Reithinger et al. (1996), for example, used deleted interpolation to smooth the dialogue n-grams. Chu-Carroll (1998) uses knowledge of subdialogue structure to selectively skip previous DAs in choosing conditioning for DA prediction. Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) may also have been the first to use word ngrams as a miniature grammar for DAs, to be used in improving speech recognition. The idea caught on very quickly: Suhm and Waibel (1994), Mast et al. (1996), Warnke et al. (1997), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Taylor et al. (1998) all use variants of backoff, interpolated, or class n-gram language models to estimate DA likelihoods. Any kind of sufficiently powerful, trainable language model could perform this function, of course, and indeed Alexandersson and Reithinger (1997) propose using automatically learned stochastic context-free grammars.

Word-based posterior probability estimators are also possible, although less common. Mast et al. (1996) propose the use of semantic classification trees, a kind of decision tree conditioned on word patterns as features. Finally, Ries (1999a) shows that neural networks using only unigram features can be superior to higher-order n-gram DA models. Warnke et al. (1999) and Ohler, Harbeck, and Niemann (1999) use related discriminative training algorithms for language models. Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) and Suhm and Waibel (1994), followed by ChuCarroll (1998), seem to have been the first to note that such a combination of word and dialogue n-grams could be viewed as a dialogue HMM with word strings as the observations. (Indeed, with the exception of Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998), all models listed in Table 14 rely on some version of this HMM metaphor.) Some researchers explicitly used HMM induction techniques to infer dialogue grammars. Woszczyna and Waibel (1994), for example, trained an ergodic HMM using expectation-maximization to model speech act sequencing. Kita et al. (1996) made one of the few att</context>

DA modeling has mostly been geared toward automatic DA classification, and much less work has been done on applying DA models to automatic speech recognition.

In the case of utterance duration, the measure correlates both with length in words and with overall speaking rate. The gender feature that classified speakers as either male or female was used to test for potential inadequacies in FO normalizations. Where appropriate, we included both raw features and values normalized by utterance and/or conversation. We also included features that are the output of the pitch accent and boundary tone event detector of Taylor (2000) (e.g., the number of pitch accents in the utterance). A complete description of prosodic features and an analysis of their usage in our models can be found in Shriberg et al. (1998). 5.2.2 Prosodic Decision Trees. For our prosodic classifiers, we used CART-style decision trees (Breiman et al. 1984).

Previous research on DA modeling has generally focused on task-oriented dialogue, with three tasks in particular garnering much of the research effort. The Map Task corpus (Anderson et al. 1991; Bard et al. 1995) consists of conversations between two speakers with slightly different maps of an imaginary territory. Their task is to help one speaker reproduce a route drawn only on the other speaker&apos;s map, all without being able to see each other&apos;s maps. Of the DA modeling algorithms described below, Taylor et al. (1998) and Wright (1998) were based on Map Task. The VERBMOBIL corpus consists of two-party scheduling dialogues. A number of the DA modeling algorithms described below were developed for VERBMOBIL, including those of Mast et al. (1996), Warnke et al. (1997), Reithinger et al. (1996), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998).

An alternative way to compute prosodically based DA likelihoods uses pitch accents and boundary phrases (Taylor et al. 1997). The approach relies on the intuition that different utterance types are characterized by different intonational &amp;quot;tunes&amp;quot; (Kowtko 1996), and has been successfully applied to the classification of move types in the DCIEM Map Task corpus (Wright and Taylor 1997).

In addition, we should model more of the nonlocal aspects of discourse structure, despite our negative results so far. For example, a context-free discourse grammar could potentially account for the nested structures proposed in Grosz and Sidner (1986).&apos; The standard n-gram models for DA discrimination with lexical cues are probably suboptimal for this task, simply because they are trained in the maximum likelihood framework, without explicitly optimizing discrimination between DA types. This may be overcome by using discriminative training procedures (Warnke et al. 1999; Ohler, Harbeck, and Niemann 1999). Training neural networks directly with posterior probability (Ries 1999a) seems to be a more principled approach and it also offers much easier integration with other knowledge sources. Prosodic features, for example, can simply be added to the lexical features, allowing the model to capture dependencies and redundancies across knowledge sources. Keyword-based techniques from the field of message classification should also be applicable here (Rose, Chang, and Lippmann 1991). Eventually, it is desirable to integrate dialogue grammar, lexical, and prosodic cu</context>

Models of various orders were compared by their perplexities, i.e., the average number of choices the model predicts for each tag, conditioned on the preceding tags. Table 5 shows perplexities for three types of models: P(U), the DAs alone; P(U, T), the combined DA/speaker ID sequence; and P(UIT), the DAs conditioned on known speaker IDs (appropriate for the Switchboard task). As expected, we see an improvement (decreasing perplexities) for increasing n-gram order. However, the incremental gain of a trigram is small, and higher-order models did not prove useful.

All DAs of a particular type found in the training corpus were pooled, and a DA-specific trigram model was estimated using standard techniques (Katz backoff [Katz 19871 with Witten-Bell discounting [Witten and Bell 1991]). 4 The frequency of STATEMENTS across all labeled data was slightly different, cf.

In doing so, we will pull together previous approaches as well as new ideas. For example, our model draws on the use of DA n-grams and the hidden Markov models of conversation present in earlier work, such as Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) and Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) (see Section 7). However, our framework generalizes earlier models, giving us a clean probabilistic approach for performing DA classification from unreliable words and nonlexical evidence. For the 341 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 3 speech recognition task, our framework provides a mathematically principled way to condition the speech recognizer on conversation context through dialogue structure, as well as on nonlexical information correlated with DA identity.

Previous research on DA modeling has generally focused on task-oriented dialogue, with three tasks in particular garnering much of the research effort. The Map Task corpus (Anderson et al. 1991; Bard et al. 1995) consists of conversations between two speakers with slightly different maps of an imaginary territory. Their task is to help one speaker reproduce a route drawn only on the other speaker&apos;s map, all without being able to see each other&apos;s maps. Of the DA modeling algorithms described below, Taylor et al. (1998) and Wright (1998) were based on Map Task. The VERBMOBIL corpus consists of two-party scheduling dialogues. A number of the DA modeling algorithms described below were developed for VERBMOBIL, including those of Mast et al. (1996), Warnke et al. (1997), Reithinger et al. (1996), Reithinger and Klesen (1997), and Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1998).

For example, in the Map Task domain, 33% of the words occur in 1 of the 12 DAs (iNsTRucT). Table 14 shows the approximate size of the corpora, the tag set, and tag estimation accuracy rates for various recent models of DA prediction. The results summarized in the table also illustrate the differences in inherent difficulty of the tasks. For example, the task of Warnke et al. (1997) was to simultaneously segment and tag DAs, whereas the other results rely on a prior manual segmentation. Similarly, the task in Wright (1998) and in our study was to determine DA types from speech input, whereas work by others is based on hand-transcribed textual input. 363 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 3 Table 13 Dialogue act tag sets used in three other extensively studied corpora.

An alternative way to compute prosodically based DA likelihoods uses pitch accents and boundary phrases (Taylor et al. 1997). The approach relies on the intuition that different utterance types are characterized by different intonational &amp;quot;tunes&amp;quot; (Kowtko 1996), and has been successfully applied to the classification of move types in the DCIEM Map Task corpus (Wright and Taylor 1997). The system detects sequences of distinctive pitch patterns by training one continuousdensity HMM for each DA type. Unfortunately, the event classification accuracy on the Switchboard corpus was considerably poorer than in the Map Task domain, and DA recognition results when coupled with a discourse grammar were substantially worse than with decision trees. The approach could prove valuable in the future, however, if the intonation event detector can be made more robust to corpora like OUTS. 356 Stolcke et al.

A backchannel is a short utterance that plays discourse-structuring roles, e.g., indicating that the speaker should go on talking. These are usually referred to in the conversation analysis literature as &amp;quot;continuers&amp;quot; and have been studied extensively (Jefferson 1984; Schegloff 1982; Yngve 1970). We expect recognition of backchannels to be useful because of their discourse-structuring role (knowing that the hearer expects the speaker to go on talking tells us something about the course of the narrative) and because they seem to occur at certain kinds of syntactic boundaries; detecting a backchannel may thus help in predicting utterance boundaries and surrounding lexical material. For an intuition about what backchannels look like, Table 3 shows the most common realizations of the approximately 300 types (35,827 tokens) of backchannel in our Switchboard subset.
