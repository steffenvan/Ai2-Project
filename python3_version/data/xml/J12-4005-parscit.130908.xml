This article deals with deverbal nominalizations in Spanish; concretely, we focus on the deno-
tative distinction between event and result nominalizations. The goals of this work is twofold:
first, to detect the most relevant features for this denotative distinction; and, second, to build an
automatic classification system of deverbal nominalizations according to their denotation. We
have based our study on theoretical hypotheses dealing with this semantic distinction and
we have analyzed them empirically by means of Machine Learning techniques which are the
basis of the ADN-Classifier. This is the first tool that aims to automatically classify deverbal
nominalizations in event, result, or underspecified denotation types in Spanish. The ADN-
Classifier has helped us to quantitatively evaluate the validity of our claims regarding deverbal
nominalizations. We set up a series of experiments in order to test the ADN-Classifier with differ-
ent models and in different realistic scenarios depending on the knowledge resources and natural
language processors available. The ADN-Classifier achieved good results (87.20% accuracy).

of unrestricted text, such as Minimal Recursive Semantics in Lingo/LKB (Copestake

Sense Disambiguation (WSD), have almost reached their practical upper bounds and
it is difficult to move forward without using a serious semantic representation of the
text under consideration. Given the limitations and the difficulties in obtaining an
in-depth semantic representation of texts as a whole, most efforts have been focused
on partial semantic representation using less expressive semantic formalisms, such as
those that come under the umbrella of Description Logic variants, or on discarding the
whole semantic interpretation task in order to focus on smaller (and easier) subtasks.
This is the case, for instance, in Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) systems, which indicate
the semantic relations that hold between a predicate and its associated participants
and properties, the relations of which are drawn from a pre-specified list of possible
semantic roles for that predicate or class of predicates. See M´arquez et al. (2008) and
Palmer, Gildea, and Xue (2010) for recent surveys. Closely related to SRL is the task
of learning Selectional Restrictions for a predicate, for example, the kind of semantic
class each argument of the predicate must belong to (Mechura 2008). In this case
a predefined set of semantic classes must also be used to perform the classification
task. WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2006), PropBank (Palmer,
Kingsbury, and Gildea 2005), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), and OntoNotes
(Hovy et al. 2006) are resources frequently used for this purpose. Most of these efforts
are verb-centered and reduce role labeling to the roles played by entities around a
predicate instantiated as a verb. At a finer level, there is the task of WSD, for example,
assigning the most appropriate sense to each lexical unit of the text from a predefined
lexical-semantic resource. Once again a catalogue of classes has to be used as a range
for the assignment.1 In this case as well, despite its excessive finer granularity, WordNet
is the most widely used reference. See Navigli (2009) for a recent survey.
In this line of research, there has recently been a growing interest in going beyond
verb-centered hypotheses to tackle the computational treatment of deverbal nominal-
izations (nouns derived from verbs), in order to move forward to the full compre-
hension of texts. Deverbal nominalizations are lexical units that contain rich semantic
information equivalent to a clausal structure. Many recent studies have focused on
the detection of semantic relations between pairs of nominals that belong to different
Nominal Phrases (NPs), such as Task 4 of SemEval 2007 (Girju et al. 2009) and Task 8
of SemEval 2010 (Hendrickx et al. 2010), or between nominals taking part in noun
compound constructions. In the latter case, they take into account a predefined set
of semantic relations (Girju et al. 2005) or use verb paraphrases with prepositions
(Task 9 of SemEval 2010 [Butnariu et al. 2010a, 2010b]). Although these works include
nominalizations, they are not strictly focused on them but cover all type of nouns.
Actually, most of the work studying only deverbal nominalizations is focused on their
argument structure: Some authors focus on the detection of arguments within the NP
headed by the nominalization (Hull and Gomez 2000; Lapata 2002; Gurevich et al. 2006;
Pad´o, Pennacchiotti, and Sporleder 2008; Surdeanu et al. 2008; Gurevich and Waterman
2009), whereas others center their attention on detecting the implicit arguments of the
nominalizations which are outside the NP (Gerber and Chai 2010; Ruppenhofer et al.
2010). Among the former group, there are different approaches to the problem: Lapata
(2002) and Gurevich and Waterman (2009) use probabilistic models, Hull and Gomez
(2000) and Gurevich et al. (2006) develop heuristic rules, Pad´o, Pennacchiotti, and

approaches.

Sporleder (2008) work with an unsupervised SRL system, and in Surdeanu et al. (2008)
the work presented uses supervised SRL systems. The kind of argument annotated is
also different in these works: Although only two, more syntactic labels (subj [subject]
and obj [object]), are used to annotate the arguments in Lapata (2002), Gurevich et al.
(2006), and Gurevich and Waterman (2009), Pad´o, Pennacchiotti, and Sporleder (2008)
use FrameNet labels and Surdeanu et al. (2008) use NomBank (Meyers, Reeves, and
Macleod 2004)2 labels. The interpretation of nominalizations is crucial because they are
common in texts and an important amount of information is represented within them. In
the AnCora-ES corpus (Taul´e, Marti, and Recasens 2008), for instance, the semantic in-
formation is mostly coded in verbs (56,590 verbal occurrences) but a significant number
of deverbal nominalizations (23,431 occurrences) also encode rich semantic information.
Most of the work on this topic sets out from the denotative distinction between
nominalizations referring to an event, those that express an action or a process, and
nominalizations referring to a result, those expressing the outcome of an action or
process. From a theoretical point of view, it is stated that this denotative distinction
may have repercussions on the argument-taking capability of deverbal nominaliza-
tions. Despite being aware of this distinction, computational approaches focus on event
nominalizations, not taking into account the result ones or, more frequently, without
characterizing the difference. For instance, SRL systems are mostly applied to event
nominalizations (Pradhan et al. 2004; Erk and Pad´o 2006; Liu and Ng 2007). Result
nominalizations are more frequent than the event types, however, at least in Spanish
(1,845 event occurrences in contrast to 20,037 result occurrences in AnCora-ES). In the
present work, we hypothesize that result nominalizations, like event nominalizations,
can take arguments; therefore, discarding result nominalizations would imply a loss of
semantic information, equally relevant to text representation. In this article, we focus
our interest on this denotative distinction. Concretely, we aim to determine the relevant
linguistic information required to classify deverbal nominalizations as event or result
types in Spanish. In order to achieve this goal, we have built an automatic classifier of
deverbal nominalizations—the ADN-Classifier—for Spanish, aimed at identifying the
semantic denotation of these nominal predicates (Peris et al. 2010). The ADN-Classifier
is a tool that takes into account different levels of linguistic information depending on
its availability, such as senses, lemmas, or syntactic and semantic information coded
in the verbal and nominal lexicons (AnCora-Verb [Aparicio, Taul´e, and Marti2008]
and AnCora-Nom [Peris and Taul´e 2011]) or in the AnCora-ES corpus.
Therefore, this article contributes to the semantic analysis of texts focusing on
Spanish deverbal nominalizations, although the proposal presented could be extended
to other Romance languages. We base our study on theoretical hypotheses that we
analyze empirically, and as a result we have developed three new resources: 1) the
ADN-Classifier, the first tool that allows for the automatic classification of deverbal
nouns as event or result nominalizations; 2) the AnCora-ES corpus enriched with
the annotation of deverbal nominalizations according to their semantic denotation,
the only Spanish corpus that incorporates this information; and 3) AnCora-Nom, a
lexicon of deverbal nominalizations containing information about denotation types
and argument structure.
The ADN-Classifier can be used independently in NLP tasks, such as Corefer-
ence Resolution and Paraphrase Detection (Recasens and Vila 2010). For Coreference

Resolution tasks it would be useful to have the nominalizations classified into denota-
tions in order to detect coreference types. For instance, if a nominalization has a verbal
antecedent (anchor) and its denotation is of the event type, an identity coreference rela-
tion could be established between them (Example (1)). If the nominalization is of the
result type, however, the relation established between verb and noun would be a bridg-
ing coreference relation (Example (2)) (Clark 1975; Recasens, Mart´ı, and Taul´e 2007).

As for Paraphrase Detection (Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis 2010; Madnani and

this type of information can also be useful for this task. For instance, the sentence in

If the nominalization, however, has a result interpretation as in Example (5)—
traducciones, ‘translations’ refers to the concrete object, that is, the book translated—
it is impossible to have a paraphrase with a clausal structure. This is due to the fact
that result nominalizations can denote an object whereas verbs cannot denote objects.
In fact, result nominalizations can only be paraphrases of other NPs denoting objects
(Example (6)).
The AnCora-ES corpus enriched with denotative information could be used as
training and test data for WSD systems. The work presented in this article also provides
an additional insight into the linguistic question underlying it: the characterization of
deverbal nominalizations according to their denotation and the identification of the
most useful criteria for distinguishing between these denotation types.

2. Theoretical Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99907725">
In the linguistics literature related to nominalizations, one of the most studied and
controversial topics is the denotative distinction between event and result nominaliza-
tions. By event nominalization we mean those nouns that denote an action or process
in the same way that a verb does. In other words, as their verbal counterparts, event
nominalizations have the aspectual property of dynamicity (Example (7)). In contrast, a
result nominalization refers to the state (Example (9)) or the concrete or abstract object
resulting from the event (Example (8)). Both types of result nominalizations (states and
objects) lack the aspectual property of dynamicity.

<bodyText confidence="0.999866454545455">
In Example (7), the noun adaptaci´on (‘adaptation’) denotes an event because it expresses
an action in the same way that a verb does (it is equivalent to El proyecto americano con-
siste en adaptar la novela Paper Boy, ‘The American project consists of adapting the Paper
Boy novel’). The event interpretation is characterized as dynamic because it implies a
change from ‘not being adapted’ to ‘being adapted.’ In contrast, in Example (8) the same
nominalization is understood as a result because it denotes a specific object that is the
outcome of the action of adapting a creative work into a film. In Example (9), the result
interpretation is due to the fact that the verb base of tendencia, ‘trend,’ denotes a state,
so the noun inherits the property of stativity (non-dynamicity) and does not imply any
change.
In this sense, our notions of event and result are equivalent to the complex-event
and result nominalizations, respectively, in the terminology of Grimshaw (1990)3 or the
terms process and result used in Pustejovsky (1995)4 and Alexiadou (2001). Although
the event vs. result distinction we make is widespread, it is true that event and result
nominalizations can also be represented in a more fine-grained way. For instance,
Eberle, Faasz, and Heid (2009) distinguish between events (messung, ‘measurement’),
states (teilung, ‘division’), and objects (lieferung, ‘furnished material’) in German
nominalizations, and Balvet, Barque, and Marin (2010) propose a typology of French
nominalizations that contemplates four aspectual types: states (admiration, ‘admiration’),
durative events (op´eration, ‘operation’), punctual events (explosion, ‘explosion’), and objects
(bˆatiment, ‘building’). For English, Levi (1978) identifies four types of nominalizations:
actions (parental refusal), which are equivalent to the event notion; agents ( financial

analyst), which denote the agent of an action and are characterized by using a different
set of suffixes; products (human error), which denote the result of an action; and patients
(student’s inventions), which denote the patient object of the action. Also for English,
Nunes (1993) defines five types of nominalizations: process nouns, that name the action
or process denoted by the base verb (The documents’ destruction by the North); result
nouns, that denote a new creation resulting from the base verb (The invention was put on
display); accumulated-action nouns, that name the sum total of a verb activity (The attack
was unexpected); experiential-state nouns, nominalized stative verbs or nominalizations of
a state brought about by a particular verb (Sam’s interest in maths); and experiential-state
results, the result counterpart of the previous class (Sam has many interests).
The authors working on this topic mainly differ on two issues. On the one
hand, they do not agree on how to consider (and therefore, how to represent) these
two denotations: as two senses of the same lexical unit (Pustejovsky 1995; Badia
2002; Alonso 2004) or as two different lexical units (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999;
Alexiadou 2001). Regarding this denotative distinction, several linguistic criteria have
been proposed in order to identify each of these denotations, mostly for English,
although there are some proposals for Spanish (Picallo 1999), French, Greek, Russian,
and Polish (Alexiadou 2001) (see Table 2 in Section 4.1). On the other hand, authors
differ on the argument-taking capacity of deverbal nominalizations: Some linguists
maintain that only event deverbal nominalizations can take arguments (Zubizarreta
1987; Grimshaw 1990), whereas others consider that both event and result nominaliza-
tions can take arguments (Pustejovsky 1995; Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001).
Authors who conceptualize event and result nominalizations as different lexical
units justify this in different ways. Grimshaw (1990) considers that only complex-event
nominals legitimate an argument structure, and that constitutes the main difference
with respect to result nominalizations which, according to her, lack argument structure.
In Alexiadou (2001) and Picallo (1999), the idea that event and result nominalizations
are different lexical units is justified by the different functional projection of these two
types of nominalization and by word-formation at different levels of the language,5
respectively. In contrast to Grimshaw, however, they state that both types of nominal-
izations can select arguments. In the words of Alexiadou (2001, page 69): “Given that
there is no lexical difference between verbs and process nouns, and between result and
process nouns, apart from the functional domain, all can take arguments.” Picallo also
believes that complements of result nominalizations are arguments when argumental
relationships can be established between them and the nominal head.
In contrast, those who consider both denotations as senses of the same lexical unit
maintain that nominalizations are underspecified lexical units (Pustejovsky 1995), units
in which a disjunction of meaning is present (Alonso 2004), or simply lexical units with
different senses (Badia 2002). Specifically, Pustejovsky accounts for the event-result ambi-
guity in nominalizations by means of an underspecified lexical representation called dot-
object, arguing that event-result nominalizations are cases of complementary polysemy:
“both senses of a logically polysemous noun seem relevant for the interpretation of the
noun in the context, but one sense seems ‘focused’ for purposes of a particular context”
(Pustejovsky 1995, page 31). In relation to argument-taking capacity, both types of
nominalizations are argumental because the dot-object representation has an argument
structure in which the nominal arguments are specified.

nominalizations are created in the lexicon; therefore they have different derivation processes.

Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations
Alonso (2004) argues that these nominalizations present a disjunction of meaning
because they can update an event and a result reading in the same sentence without the
understanding of the sentence being affected. For instance, declaraci´on (‘declaration’) in
Example (10)6 can be interpreted as an event and as a result at the same time: Only event
nominalizations can be said to have an initial moment and only result nominalizations
can be said to have five pages. These two senses both originate in the same lexical unit,
which includes both, and the context provides both meanings.

‘The statement&lt;event/result&gt; that the judge took from the witness, which
began at eleven, takes up five pages.’
Regarding argument-taking capacity, Alonso maintains that all nominalizations taking
part in a support-verb construction can select arguments. So, if a result nominalization
is part of a support-verb construction, it will also have argument structure. Following
these authors, we also consider that result nominalizations can take arguments.
Within a computational framework, there are different models that represent nom-
inalizations; not all of them take into account the event and result distinction, however.
For instance, in NomBank (Meyers, Reeves, and Macleod 2004) this distinction is com-
pletely ignored and the authors focus on argument structure. In contrast, Spencer and
Zaretskaya (1999) label each nominal sense with one of the Grimshaw semantic cate-
gories (i.e., complex event, simple event, and result). Their database contains information
about 7,000 Russian verbs and their 5,000 corresponding nominalizations, distinguish-
ing between the verbal entries that nominalize the whole event while preserving the
verbal argument structure, and those that denote a concrete or abstract result of the
verb. The Nomage project (Balvet, Barque, and Marin 2010) annotates French deverbal
nominalizations in the French TreeBank (Abeill´e, Cl´ement, and Kinyon 2000) with one
of the four classes proposed in their work (i.e., states, durative events, punctual events, and
objects). In the middle ground between these two positions, we find the representation
models proposed in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe
1998; Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), and Ontonotes (Hovy et al. 2006). WordNet, possibly
due to its extremely fine granularity, usually includes among the senses corresponding
to deverbal nouns one paraphrased as “the acting of verb x” (our event nominalization)
and another paraphrased to something similar to “the thing X-verb+ed” (our result
nominalization). FrameNet distinguishes between deverbal nominalizations defined
as the action or process of X verb and nominalizations defined as entities. Concerning
nouns, Ontonotes is interested in the disambiguation of noun senses in order to create
an ontology. Within deverbal nouns the authors distinguish between nominalization
senses that truly inherit the verb meaning and deverbal noun senses whose denotation
is not directly related to the verb meaning.7 That is, they distinguish between two
different types of deverbal nouns but this distinction is not akin to the event-result one.
The distinctions established in WordNet and FrameNet are more similar to the one
proposed in OntoNotes.
To sum up, the event vs. result distinction in deverbal nominalizations has received
much attention in linguistics literature. It seems to be less relevant in the computational

Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations
an automatic classification system for deverbal nominalizations according to their de-
notation. In Figure 1 the overall methodology for carrying out this work is schematized.
In order to determine the most relevant features, the first step was to carry out a
linguistic study of deverbal nominalizations (see Section 4). This study consisted of the
application of the linguistic criteria stated in the literature to a reduced set of nominal-
izations corresponding to the occurrences extracted from a 100,000 word (henceforth
100kw) subset of the AnCora-ES corpus. As an outcome, we manually obtained (see
step 1 in Figure 1) a lexicon for this deverbal nominalization set, AnCora-Nom-R1 (Peris,
Taul´e, and Rodriguez 2009), which allowed us to annotate the corresponding deverbal
occurrences in the corpus subset. The nominalization classifying model (see step 2 in
Figure 1) underlying these two initial resources was tested by empirical methods. This
first model of classification is based on sense distinctions—that is, the extraction of
features was performed at sense level and the examples for learning (both positive and
negative) corresponded to different senses in the lexicon; thus, we will refer to it as the
sense-based model. We set up a series of experiments based on Machine Learning (ML)
techniques in order to evaluate the consistency of the data annotated in AnCora-Nom-
R1, to analyze the relevance of the attributes used in the lexical-semantic representation
and to infer new useful features to distinguish between event and result nominalizations.
As well as experimenting with AnCora-Nom-R1 simple features, we experimented with
the binarization8 and grouping9 of several of them to address sparseness problems.
Furthermore, with these experiments the foundations of the automatic classification
system, the ADN-Classifier-R1, were laid (see step 3 in Figure 1). See Section 6 for a
description of the ADN-Classifier.
Once the consistency of the annotated data was corroborated and the most relevant
features were established, we focused on the building of the ADN-Classifier, the second
goal of the research presented in this article. In order to develop the final version of
the ADN-Classifier (R3) we increased the corpus data used for learning. Therefore, we
needed to annotate the denotation types in the whole AnCora-ES. Because this involves
an increase in the number of nominalization occurrences to annotate (23,431 occurrences
in contrast to 3,077), we carried out this annotation automatically. To do so, we modified
the (sense-based) model of classification underlying the ADN-Classifier-R1 (see step 2
in Figure 1) creating a new model able to carry out the more realistic task of classifying
the occurrences in the whole AnCora-ES corpus.
This new model (see step 5 in Figure 1) uses the following as knowledge resources:
1) the AnCora-Verb lexicon to obtain the features from the verbs related to nominaliza-
tions; 2) the complete AnCora-ES corpus (500kw); and 3) AnCora-Nom-R2, an extended
lexicon of nominalizations without denotation types obtained automatically (see step 4
in Figure 1). This lexicon contains a total of 1,655 lexical entries, corresponding to the
1,655 nominalization types in the whole AnCora-ES. Because we annotate the occur-
rences in the AnCora-ES corpus, however, we reduce our dependence on the lexical
source AnCora-Nom-R2 (see Section 5.3), removing the sense-specific information from
it and taking into account only the information shared by all the senses of one lemma,
while maintaining the features extracted from the corpus. In this sense, we adapted the
sense-based model developed in ADN-Classifier-R1 (see step 2 in Figure 1) to obtain
a new classification model that is based on lemmas (and not senses) (see step 5 in

corpus with denotation information (see step 7 in Figure 1). Afterwards, in order to
evaluate the performance of the developed model, the corpus annotation was manually
validated (Peris, Taul´e, and Rodr´ıguez 2010) (see step 8 in Figure 1). This manual process
also guarantees the quality of the corpus annotation, leading to the final version of the
AnCora-Nom lexicon (R3) containing denotation type information.
At that moment, we were able to build the final version of the ADN-Classifier (R3)
(see step 10 in Figure 1). In order to do so, we set up a series of experiments leading to
the development of new sense- and lemma-based models using the resources already
built (AnCora-ES with denotation information and AnCora-Nom-R3), that is, models
learned with more instances. We also replicated the experiments at sense and lemma
level with the subset of 100kw from the already enriched AnCora-ES and the subset
of 817 lexical entries from the AnCora-Nom-R3. Specifically, we carried out a set of
new ML experiments using the simple and binarized features from the nominal and
verbal lexicons as well as additional features obtained from the AnCora-ES corpus (the
so-called contextual features). For the evaluation of the different sense- and lemma-
based models derived from this set of experiments (see step 9 in Figure 1), tenfold
cross-validation was used with the pre-created resources. These models give rise to the
final version of the ADN-Classifier (R3) (see step 10 in Figure 1). See Section 6 for a
description of the ADN-Classifier.

The aim of the corpus-based linguistic study conducted was twofold. First, we wanted
to determine which of the criteria stated in the literature were the most relevant linguis-
tic features to establish the distinction between event and result denotations in Spanish.
Secondly, we wanted to find other features that could be used to reinforce the semantic
distinction we are dealing with.
In order to do this, we selected a sample of 817 Spanish deverbal nominalizations
corresponding to 3,077 occurrences. These nominalizations were obtained semiauto-
matically from a 100kw subset of the AnCora-ES corpus. In this selection we took into
account a predefined list of ten suffixes (-a, -aje, -i´on/-ci´on/-si´on/-´on, -da/-do, -dura/-ura, -e,
-ido, -miento/-mento, -ncia/-nza, -o/-eo– [Santiago and Bustos 1999]) that contribute to an
event or result meaning and which take verbs as a basis for the derivation process.
This sample corresponds to the original 3LB corpus (Civit and Mart´ı 2004), that can
be considered to be a preliminary version of AnCora-ES. The set of 817 nominalizations
consists of those occurrences in this sub-corpus. Despite coming from different sources,
the 100kw corpus and the full 500kw corpus are comparable as is shown in Table 1.
In Table 1 we present some metrics for describing the whole AnCora-ES corpus
and its 100kw subset. We present the metrics we have used in three rows: degree

4.1 Analyzing Features from the Literature
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995675">
In order to determine which criteria stated in the literature were the most relevant, we
selected seven criteria that satisfy two conditions: first, they are some of the most widely
used by other authors, and second, it is possible to search for them in the AnCora-ES
corpus without suffering data sparseness. These criteria and the authors who propose
them are shown schematically in Table 2.
The seven criteria were analyzed by contrasting them with the behavior of the 817
Spanish deverbal nominalizations in the AnCora-ES corpus. Concretely, two graduate
students in linguistics classified the 3,077 occurrences independently into event or result
class. After this first annotation, we discussed the results with them and reached an
agreement in those cases in which the denotation type assigned was not the same. It
should be noted that the aim of this analysis was to encourage reflection on the suit-
ability of these seven criteria and on finding new clues to interpret the nominalizations
semantically.
During the classification procedure, we observed that these two denotations did
not allow us to account for all the data in the corpus. On the one hand, it is not
always possible to distinguish between event and result, because the linguistic context
(the sentence) is not always informative enough. We label such cases underspecified
types, resulting finally in three possible denotation values. On the other hand, we
noticed that some nominalizations can take part in a lexicalized construction, thus,
we added the attribute &lt;lexicalized&gt;. In such cases, we distinguish between six types
of lexicalization according to their similarity to different word classes: nominal (e.g.,
s´ındrome de abstinencia, ‘withdrawal symptoms’), verbal (e.g., estar de acuerdo, ‘to be in
agreement’), adjectival (e.g., al alza, ‘rising’), adverbial (e.g., con cuidado, ‘with care’),
prepositional (e.g., en busca de, ‘in search of’), and conjunctive (e.g., en la medida que,

‘as far as’). One of the three denotation values—event, result, underspecified—is assigned
to the whole lexicalized construction only in the case of nominal lexicalizations. It is
important to recognize such lexicalized cases because if the nominalization takes part
in a lexicalized construction other than the nominal, it does not receive a denotation
(a semantic distinction that is only associated with nouns).
The 3,077 occurrences were classified into 1,121 senses considering that different
denotations associated with a lemma are different senses. Henceforth, we refer to them
as nominalization senses. Among these 1,121 senses, 807 were annotated as result (72%),
113 as event (10%), 131 as underspecified (12%), and 70 as non-nominal lexicalized noun
(6%). It is not surprising that result nominalizations are the most frequent because events
tend to be realized mostly by verbal clauses and nominalizations are more frequently
used for the result (non-dynamic) meaning, more typical of nouns.
The fact that AnCora-ES is annotated with different linguistic information levels
allowed for the evaluation of the seven morphosyntactic and semantic criteria se-
lected. Next, we briefly present each criterion, how they were applied, and the results
obtained.10
4.1.1 Verbal Class. One of the most commonly used criterion to determine the denotation
is the verbal class from which the nominalization is derived (Picallo 1999; Alexiadou
2001; Badia 2002). It is claimed that unergative and stative verbs give rise to result
nominalizations, and unaccusative verbs usually result in ambiguous, or what we call
underspecified, nominalizations. Regarding transitive verbs, they give rise to either event,
result, or underspecified nominalizations. To analyze this criterion, we set out from the
semantic verbal classification proposed in AnCora-Verb. In this verbal lexicon, each
predicate is associated with one or more semantic classes depending on the four basic
types of events (Vendler 1967) (accomplishments which correspond to transitive verbs;
achievements corresponding to unaccusative verbs; states corresponding to stative
verbs; and activities corresponding to unergative verbs) and on the diathesis alterna-
tions in which the verb can occur. We therefore looked up the verbal classes from which
the 817 nominalizations are derived in AnCora-Verb. This allowed us to determine
whether the claims about the relation between the nominalization denotation type and
the corresponding verbal classes are valid.
In the sample analyzed, most of the nominal senses were classified as results
(72%), thus, it should not surprise us that all the verbal classes have a wide per-
centage of result nominalizations. The most significant result, however, is that stative
and unergative verbs lead nearly exclusively to result nominalizations in Spanish,
97% and 100%, respectively. Regarding transitive and unaccusative verbs, they lead to
event, result, or underspecified nominalizations. It is also interesting to remark that event
nominalizations derive mostly from transitive verbs (15%, in contrast to the 1% derived
from achievement verbs) and underspecified nominalizations derive from unaccusative
verbs (28%, in contrast to the 11% and 3% derived from transitive and state verbs,
respectively), confirming the hypothesis stated by Picallo (1999), Alexiadou (2001), and
Badia (2002).
4.1.2 Pluralization. According to Grimshaw (1990) and Alonso (2004), one of the features
that clearly identifies result nominalizations is their pluralization capacity because it is

Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations
more usual to quantify objects than events. It is important to point out, however, that
it is also possible to make an event reading of a plural nominalization. For instance, in
Example (11) bombardeos (‘shelling’) refers to multiple actions of bombing, therefore, it
is open to an event reading.

<bodyText confidence="0.9695231">
‘The shelling&lt;event&gt; of Sarajevo by the Bosnian army.’
This criterion was measured taking into account whether the 817 nominalizations
appeared in the plural in some of their occurrences in the sample analyzed. The results
obtained (98% of the nominalizations in the plural were classified as result and the
remaining 2% as underspecified) confirmed plurality as one of the features able to detect
result nominalizations. In contrast, the singular feature is not informative enough to
discard any of the nominal denotations (69% of the nominalizations were classified as
results, 15% as events, and 16% as underspecified type). Therefore, in the sample analyzed
all event nominalizations and most of the underspecified nominalizations appeared only
in the singular.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.754144">
4.1.3 Determiner Types. Authors such as Grimshaw (1990), Picallo (1999), and Alonso
(2004) claim that event nominalizations usually appear with definite articles whereas
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.974806777777778">
result nominalizations may be specified by all types of determiners. For instance,
demonstrative determiners can only specify result nominalizations because this type
of determiner is used to refer to an entity in a frame of reference. In order to evaluate
this criterion we took into account the types of determiners combining with the nomi-
nalization and also whether the noun appeared without a determiner.
Because most of the nominal senses were classified as results (72%), it should not
surprise us that all types of determiners have a wide percentage of result nominaliza-
tions. A striking result observed in Table 3, however, is that indefinite articles (99%),
demonstratives (100%), and quantifiers (100%) nearly always appear with result senses.
In contrast, the definite article, the possessive, and the empty position can occur in all
nominalization classes. Seventy-two percent of definite articles appear with result, 13%
with event, and 15% with underspecified nominalizations; 82% of possessive determiners
appear with result, 10% with events, and 8% with underspecified nominalizations; and
88% of nominalizations without determiner are classified as result, 5% as events, and 7%
as underspecified nominalizations. The data therefore partially confirm the hypotheses
from the literature: Result nominalizations appear with a wider range of determiners.
Although event nominalizations are not always specified by a definite article, they can
also appear with possessive determiners or without any determiner.

complement introduced by de or entre occurs with result nominalizations (98% and
100%, respectively) and the agent nominal complement introduced by por or por parte
de occurs with event nominalizations (100% both), corroborating the hypothesis put
forward by Picallo (1999).
4.1.5 Internal Argument. The internal argument criterion proposed by Grimshaw (1990)
and Picallo (1999) states that only event deverbal nominalizations require the presence
of an internal argument because they are more similar to verbs, whereas in result-
nominalized NPs the internal argument is not needed. Badia (2002) argues that the real-
ization of this argument is not always compulsory to obtain an event interpretation of the
nominalization. To analyze this criterion, we observed those nominalized NPs in which
the internal argument was explicit and the type of argument that realized it. As a result,
we observed that the majority of event nominalizations are complemented by an inter-
nal argument (98%). This is also the case for underspecified nominalizations in a fairly
high percentage (78%). The percentage decreases considerably in result nominalizations
(34%), however. Therefore, the data seem to confirm Picallo’s and Grimshaw’s hypoth-
esis. Table 3 shows that there are four constituents that realize an internal argument:
possessive determiners, PPs, genitive relative pronouns, and relational adjectives. The

Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations
first two constituents appear in the three nominal denotation types: 41% of possessive
determiners appear with result nominalizations, 38% with events nominalizations, and
21% with underspecified nominalizations; and 53% of PPs complement result, 25% events,
and 22% underspecified nominalizations. Relative pronouns only occur with event (29%)
and result (71%) denotation types, and, finally relational adjectives occur nearly exclu-
sively in result nominalizations (97%). This last fact constitutes an identification feature
for result nominalizations, as Picallo states (see next criterion).
Table 3 shows the results obtained for each criterion.
4.1.6 External Arguments vs. Possessors. Grimshaw (1990) states that PPs introduced
by the preposition ‘by’ (by-PPs), relational adjectives, and possessive determiners in
English would be interpreted as external arguments (subjects) in the case of event
nominalized NPs. These constituents, however, would be interpreted as possessors (that
is, as non-argumental) in result nominalized NPs. Other authors, like Picallo (1999),
nevertheless, claim that possessive determiners may be argumental in result and event
nominalizations in Spanish. Regarding relational adjectives, Picallo argues that these
constituents can only be arguments of result nominalizations. As seen, there is no
consensus among authors; therefore, it seemed to us to be an interesting criterion to
contrast. We observed whether these constituents (by-PPs, relational adjectives, and
possessive determiners) were interpreted as external arguments in the nominalized NP
sample. If this was so, we also analyzed whether the fact of being external arguments
conditioned the denotation of the nominalization.12
The results obtained are very clear: PPs introduced by por (‘by’) with an agent
interpretation only occur in NPs headed by event nominalizations. Relational adjectives
are interpreted as external arguments only in NPs headed by result nominalizations.
Possessive determiners with an agent interpretation are mostly (95%) constituents of
NPs headed by result nominalizations though they can also be constituents (5%) of
NPs headed by underspecified nominalizations. Therefore, for Spanish, Grimshaw’s hy-
pothesis is only partially corroborated because only by-PPs guarantee the event read-
ing. Regarding relational adjectives, Picallo’s thesis is confirmed, because this type of
constituent mostly appears as an argument of result nominalizations. Moreover, we
observed a preference for possessive determiners to be external arguments of result
nominalizations, which is not stated in any of the theoretical proposals.

izations may be an indicator for determining the denotation (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo
1999; Badia 2002). Result nominalizations tend to combine with attributive predicates,
whereas event nominalizations tend to be subjects of predicates such as tener lugar (‘to
take place’) or ocurrir (‘to happen’) because these predicates tend to select event type
subjects. In order to examine this criterion, we analyzed the types of predicates com-
bined with the 817 nominalization types. We observed whether the predicates belong
to the event-denoting class (tener lugar, ‘to take place’; ocurrir, ‘to happen’; comenzar,
‘to begin’; acabar, ‘to finish’; durar, ‘to last’; llevar a cabo, ‘to carry out’) or if they were
attributive predicates (ser, ‘to be’; estar, ‘to be’; parecer, ‘to seem’ ). Table 3 illustrates that
12 The way we decided whether these constituents were external arguments consisted of paraphrasing
the nominalized NPs into clause structures in order to see if they were semantically equivalent to
verbal subjects.

attributive predicates tend to choose result nominalizations (75%) as subjects whereas
eventive predicates do not show a clear preference for any type of nominal: Forty-
four percent of them combine with result, 41% with events, and 15% with underspecified
nominalizations. These results partially confirmed what is stated by these three authors:
result nominals combine preferentially with attributive predicates.
From the corpus-based study, we conclude that the semantic distinction between
event and result nominalizations is not always as clear as is stated in the literature. The
criteria proposed in the literature are well suited to constructed examples but when
they are applied to naturally occurring data they do not work so well: Some of them
cannot be applied and sometimes we found contradictory criteria in the same example.
That said, it is important to point out that these criteria are not irrefutable proofs for
making an event or a result reading, but rather indicators that can help us to strengthen
our semantic intuition. In fact, we propose the third denotation type underspecified for
those cases in which semantic intuition is insufficient and the criteria for reinforcing one
of the two main denotation types are not clear.
Regarding the criteria established in the literature, the main conclusion drawn
is that not all the criteria analyzed seem to hold for Spanish. Among the evaluated
criteria, those that appear to be most helpful for distinguishing between event and result
nominalizations are: 1) the semantic class of the verb from which the noun is derived;
2) the pluralization capacity; 3) the determiner types; 4) the preposition introducing an
agentive complement; and 5) the obligatory presence of an internal argument. These
features are represented as attributes in the nominal lexical entries of the AnCora-Nom
lexicon (see Section 5.3).
It is interesting to note that the number of criteria found that reinforce result read-
ings is significantly higher than the number of criteria found that strengthen event
readings. In every criterion we find features that support the identification of result
nominalizations but not event nominalizations. To support result nominalizations the
following features were found: nominalizations deriving from unergative and stative
verbs; nominalizations appearing in the plural; nominalizations specified by an indeter-
minate article, a demonstrative, or quantifier determiner; nominalizations with an agent
complement introduced by de (‘of’) or entre (‘between’); the nonrealization of the inter-
nal argument; and nominalizations having relational adjectives as arguments and the
attributive predicate combined with them. In order to underpin event nominalizations,
however, the only unambiguous criterion found was when the preposition introducing
a PP agent complement is por (‘by’) or por parte de (‘by’).13 If we take into account that
the agent complement is mostly optional in an NP configuration, it is very difficult to
find a criterion within the NP context to support event nominalizations.
We believe that there are more features to support result nominalizations because
they are closer to non-derived nouns and, like them, admit a wide variety of config-
urations: plural inflection, different types of determiners, the possibility of appearing
without complements, and so forth. In contrast, event nominalizations (since they are
not typical nouns because they denote an action), like verbs, do not admit this variety
of configurations: They rarely appear without complements, admit fewer types of deter-
miners, and appear in the plural less frequently. Most of the configurations they admit
are also admitted by result nominalizations; this explains why there are more criteria
to support result than event nominalizations.

In fact, the remaining criteria—the fact of deriving from transitive or unaccusative
verbs; the nominalization being in the singular; the co-occurrence with a definite ar-
ticle, a possessive determiner, or without any determiner; the presence of the internal
argument; and the combination with typically eventive predicates—do not support any
specific denotation. As a result, there are several cases where it is very difficult to assign
a denotation, especially when the context is not clear enough, and therefore, we need
to apply the underspecified tag.

provide us with clues for the differentiation between event and result nominalizations.

4.2 Finding New Clues to Support Event and Result Denotations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910307692308">
The analysis of 3,077 nominalization occurrences, focusing on the semantic distinction
between those denoting an event, result, or underspecified type, has allowed us to find
new clues that strengthen these readings, especially the event reading.
One of the clearest clues for detecting the event nominalizations is the possibility of
paraphrasing the NP with a clausal structure, as we saw in Section 1, Examples (3)–
(6). Another valuable clue is to check whether the nominalization admits an agent
complement introduced by por (‘by’) or por parte de (‘by’). We use this criterion because
it is the most informative one to support event nominalizations but it is also a very
optional complement and is scarcely represented in the corpus. The annotators could
use these two tests to decide the denotation type. Therefore, they had two extra criteria
that the data did not provide.
Furthermore, we found other indicators that can help to select one denotation
type, the so-called selectors. We identified two types of selectors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987542352941177">
1. External selectors: Prepositions like durante (‘during’), nouns like proceso
(‘process’), adjectives like resultante (‘resulting’), verbs like empezar
(‘begin’), and adverbs en v´ıa de (‘on the way to’), which are elements that
point to a specific denotation from outside the nominalized NP. For
instance, in Example (12) the preposition durante (‘during’) gives a clue to
interpret presentaci´on (‘presentation’) as an event.
2. Internal selectors: Prefixes within the nominalization that indicate a
specific denotation type; for instance, a noun with the prefix re- with a
reiterative meaning such as reubicaci´on (‘relocation’) in Example (13). This
is due to the fact that the reiterative meaning only applies to bases that
denote actions.
(12) Durante [la presentaci´on&lt;event&gt; del libro], ´el abog´o por la formaci´on de
los investigadores en innovaci´on tecnol´ogica.
‘During [the presentation&lt;event&gt; of the book], he advocated the training
of researchers in technological innovation.’
(13) Hoy [la reubicaci´on&lt;event&gt; del ex ministro] no resulta f´acil.
‘Today, [the relocation&lt;event&gt; of the ex minister] does not seem easy.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989951">
These new clues allow us to support our semantic classification independently from
the literature criteria under evaluation. The only inconvenience of these tests and the
selectors is that they cannot be implemented as features in the ADN-classifier.

5.1 AnCora-ES Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988555555556">
AnCora-ES is a 500,000 word (henceforth, 500kw) Spanish corpus14 consisting of news-
paper texts annotated at different linguistic levels: morphology (part of speech and
lemmas), syntax (constituents and functions), semantics (verbal argument structure,
thematic roles, semantic verb classes, named entities, and WordNet nominal senses),
and pragmatics (coreference).15 The corpus contains 10,678 fully parsed sentences. As
we explained in Section 3, nominalization occurrences (23,431) were automatically an-
notated with denotation types using an intermediate model of classification (see step 5
in Figure 1). This automatic annotation was then manually validated by three graduate
students in linguistics. These annotators were selected from a group of five, because
they achieved an observed agreement of over 80%, corresponding to a kappa of 65% in
an inter-annotator agreement test, whereas the average observed agreement was 75%
corresponding to a 60% kappa. For the purpose of annotation, the three annotators took
into account the semantic definition we provided, the criteria presented in Section 4.1,
and the semantic tests described in Section 4.2. The inter-annotator agreement was
carried out to ensure the consistency and quality of the AnCora-ES manual annotation.16
Therefore, the AnCora-ES corpus enriched with denotation type annotation is used
for learning the different models of the ADN-Classifier-R3. From this resource we
obtained two kinds of features:

(a) The corpus versions of the features from the lexicon (see Section 5.3): the
type of determiner used in Section 4; the number (plural or singular) in
which the nominalization occurrences appear; and the constituent type of

that dominates the nominalization in the sentence; the syntactic function
of the NP headed by a nominalization; and whether the noun appears in a
named entity.

senses, basically differentiated according to the four event classes—accomplishments,
achievements, states, and activities (Vendler 1967; Dowty 1979)—and on the diathe-

5.3 AnCora-Nom
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998955625">
This section presents AnCora-Nom,20 a Spanish lexicon of deverbal nominalizations
that has been iteratively used and improved as a result of the experiments reported
here. At present, it contains 1,655 lexical entries corresponding to 3,094 senses and
3,204 frames. These lexical entries represent the lemmas corresponding to the 23,431
deverbal nominalization occurrences appearing in the annotated AnCora-ES corpus.
For each of these lemmas we created a lexical entry using the information annotated in
the corpus.21 The features of each lexical entry are organized in three levels: lexical entry,
sense, and frame level. The lexical entry attributes are not extracted from the corpus but
added in order to document the lexical entry. Sense and frame attributes, in contrast,
were extracted from the AnCora-ES corpus. Each lexical entry is organized in different
senses, which were established taking into account the denotation type, the sense of the
base verb, and whether or not the nominalization is part of a lexicalized construction. In
turn, each sense can also contain one or more nominal frames, depending on the verbal
frame from which the nominalization is derived. Next, we detail the attributes specified
in the three levels described above. Figure 2 shows the full information associated with
the lexical entry aceptaci´on (‘acceptance’).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.945195615384615">
5.3.1 Lexical Entry Level Attributes. These are as follows:
(a) Lemma. In Figure 2, the value for this attribute is the noun aceptaci´on
(lemma=“aceptaci´on”).
(b) The attribute language (“lng”) codifies the language represented in the lexical
entry. AnCora resources work with Spanish and Catalan, so the values of this attribute
are “es” for Spanish (lng=“es”) and “ca” for Catalan (lng=“ca”). At present, AnCora-
Nom only deals with Spanish nominalizations.
(c) The attribute origin indicates the type of word from which the nouns are de-
rived. In Figure 2, the value for this attribute is “deverbal”, meaning that this lexical
entry concerns a noun derived from a verb. At present, AnCora-Nom only contains
deverbal nouns but in the future it will include other types of nominalizations such as
deadjectivals.
(d) The attribute type refers to the word class, “noun” in Figure 2.

5.3.2 Sense Level Attributes. These include:
(e) The attribute cousin marks whether the nominalization is morphologically de-
rived from a verb (cousin=“no”, in Figure 2) or is a cousin noun (cousin=“yes”). Cousin
nouns (Meyers, Reeves, and Macleod 2004) are nouns that give rise to verbs (e.g., relaci´on
[‘relation’] &gt;relacionar [‘to relate’]), or nouns semantically related to verbs (e.g., escarnio
[‘mockery’] is related to mofarse [‘to make fun’]).
(f) The denotation attribute indicates the semantic interpretation of the deverbal
noun. The possible values are: “event,” “result,” and “underspecified.” In Figure 2, there
are two senses, the first one being result (denotation=“result”) and the second one event
(denotation=“event”).
(g) Each sense contains an identifier (“id”) to indicate the sense number.
(h) The lexicalized attribute indicates whether or not the nominalization is part
of a lexicalized construction (idiomatic expression) (Figure 2: lexicalized=“no”). In the
first case, two additional attributes are added: (i) the alternative-lemma, specifying
the whole lexicalized construction of which the nominalization is part (for instance,
alternative-lemma=“golpe de estado,” [‘coup d’etat’]), and (ii) lexicalization-type, to
distinguish between the six types of lexicalizations: “nominal,” “verbal,” “adjectival,”
“adverbial,” “prepositional,” or “conjunctive” (see Section 4). We should bear in mind
that one of the three above-mentioned denotation values is assigned to the whole
lexicalized construction only in the case of nominal lexicalizations. For instance, the
lexicalized construction golpe de estado is a nominal lexicalization (lexicalization-type=
“nominal”), and therefore, it has a denotation value (denotation=“result”).
(i) The attribute originlemma specifies the verb lemma from which the noun is
derived. In Figure 2, the value for this attribute is “aceptar” in both senses (origin-
lemma=“aceptar”).
(j) Because verbs can have different senses, the attribute originlink indicates the
concrete verbal sense of the base verb. In Figure 2, the originlink attribute takes the
same value in both senses: “verb.aceptar.1” (oringinlink=“verb.aceptar.1”).
(k) Because nouns in the AnCora corpus are annotated with WordNet synsets,22 we
incorporate this information in the attribute wordnetsynset. In Figure 2, the first sense
of aceptaci´on corresponds to two synsets (wordnetsynset=“16:00117820+16:10039397”),
whereas the second only corresponds to one (wordnetsynset=“16:00117820”). It should
be noted that senses in AnCora-Nom are coarser grained than in WordNet: a sense can
group together more than one WordNet synset.

5.3.3 Frame Level Attributes. These are detailed as follows:
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.767594833333333">
(l) The attribute type indicates the verbal frame from which the nominalization is
derived. In AnCora-Verb, each verbal sense can be realized in more than one frame:
default, passive, anticausative, locative, and so forth. In the nominal entries, we mark
the corresponding verbal frames, which are the possible values for this attribute. In
most cases, its value is “default” as in Figure 2 (type=“default”). This feature is needed
to look for the corresponding verbal semantic class in AnCora-Verb.

(m) Argument (Structure). In this complex attribute, the different arguments
(argument) and the corresponding thematic roles (thematicrole) are specified. To
represent the arguments we follow the same annotation scheme used in AnCora-
Verb. For instance, in Figure 2, the event sense has one argument (“arg1”) with a
patient thematic role (“pat”). This argument is realized twice (frequency=“2”) by
a prepositional phrase (constituent type =“sp”) introduced by the preposition de
(‘of’) (preposition=“de”) and once by a possessive determiner (type=“determiner,”
postype=“possessive”).
(n) The attribute referencemodifier represents the nominal complements that are
not arguments but which modify the reference of the nominalization. Frequency is
also taken into account. Strictly speaking, this attribute does not fit perfectly at the
frame level. We were interested in representing this information, however, and the
most suitable level was the frame level because it allows for a seamless comparison
of argumental and nonargumental nominal complements.
(o) The type of determiner has proved to be a useful criterion for distinguishing
between result and event readings, so we include this information in the attribute
specifier.23 The possible values are: “article,” “indefinite,” “demonstrative,” “exclama-
tive,” “numeral,” “interrogative,” “possessive,” “ordinal,” and “void” when there is
no determiner. In this attribute, we also take into account the frequency with which
the determiners are realized. In Figure 2, the event sense is specified twice (constituent
frequency=“2”) by an article determiner (type=“determiner,” postype=“article”).
(p) The attribute appearsinplural indicates whether or not an occurrence of a
nominalization in a particular frame appears in the plural. It is a boolean attribute. In

Figure 2, neither of the senses appear in the plural, thus, the value is “no.”

mation has been extracted, specifying the corpus file, the node path, and the sentence

6. ADN-Classifier
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943727272727">
As stated previously, our goals for building the ADN-Classifier were twofold: On the
one hand, to have at our disposal a tool to help us to quantitatively evaluate the validity
of our claims regarding deverbal nominalizations as discussed in Section 4; and, on the
other hand, to provide a classification tool able to take advantage of all the available
information in a specific scenario in the automatic classification of a deverbal noun. The
aim of the task is to classify a deverbal nominalization candidate in an event, result, or
underspecified denotation type, as well as to identify whether the nominalization takes
part in a lexicalized construction (idiomatic expression). Therefore, we model the task
as a four-way classification problem. In order to achieve these goals, some functional
requirements on the software to be built were necessary. Regarding the first goal, we
required that a tool be able to:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.768481333333333">
1. Use all the properties discussed in Section 4 as features for classification.
23 The name of the attribute refers to the syntactic position that determiners occupy in the NP;
the determiners specify the nominalization.

2. Tune the features: binarization, grouping the possible values,
generalization, combination of features, and computation of
derived features.
3. Perform feature selection.
4. Facilitate the human interpretation of the model used by the classifier.
5. Analyze the accuracy of the individual features.
6. Use either senses or lemmas corresponding to deverbal nominalization
candidates as units for classifying.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965352941176">
In order to achieve the first aim, the first version of the ADN-Classifier (R1) (Peris,
Taul´e, and Rodriguez 2009) was developed. This is the basis for the building of the
intermediate and final versions of the ADN-Classifier. The final version is presented in
detail next. Obviously, the second goal imposes heavier constraints on the design of the
tool (the ADN-Classifier-R3). As is usual in other lexical classification tasks, such as Part
Of Speech (POS) tagging or WSD, a word taken as an isolated unit is ambiguous but
can be disambiguated, or at least partially disambiguated, if enough context is taken
into account. An additional constraint is that the nominalization candidate has to be
tagged as a noun. For our classification task at least four processes are carried out: 1)
tokenization; 2) segmentation at sentence level; 3) POS tagging; and 4) localization of
a nominalization candidate by means of a set of regular expressions looking for verbal
nominalization endings.24
In this setting, a case for classifying consists of a nominalization candidate using
the POS-tagged sentence where it occurs as context, although this context is not always
sufficient for disambiguation. Additional processes could be carried out on the nomi-
nalization candidate and the sentence (WSD, chunking, full parsing, SRL, linking of the
nominalization candidate with the origin verb, etc.). Each of these processes increases
the number of possible features used for classifying but, because they are not error
free, they could involve a decrement in the global accuracy of the preprocess step.
Therefore, a careful examination of the processes, their accuracy, and the improvement
of classification accuracy is needed. For instance, performing WSD on the nominal-
ization candidate could allow for the use of sense-based features and, thus, a clear
improvement in classification accuracy. The inconvenience is that the state-of-the-art
accuracy rate of WSD is not very promising. In recent SemEval challenges, the accuracy
rate in All-Words tasks is between 60% and 70% for a baseline of 51.4% using the first
sense in WordNet, and 89% in Lexical-Sample tasks for a baseline of 78% (Chklovski
and Mihalcea 2002; Decadt et al. 2004; Pradhan et al. 2007).25 These figures depend
on the sense inventory used for disambiguation: The All-Words task uses fine-grained
senses (WordNet synsets) and the Lexical Sample task uses more coarse-grained sense
inventory (Ontonotes senses).
Therefore, we approach the problem of classification taking into account different
feature sets which come from different knowledge resources, and we examine and
evaluate the task performance when a decreasing number of knowledge resources
are used. Depending on the available knowledge resources and natural language

24 We used 10 suffixes such as -ci´on (see Section 4).
25 All these figures are for English. To have some idea of the relative difficulty of the task for Spanish
we have measured this baseline in Ancora-ES resulting in a value of 42%, that is, an 18% drop with
respect to English.

(NL) processors, we designed the classification task in different scenarios, which are
presented in Table 4. The columns include the knowledge resources used in each
scenario (column 2), whether the features used are extracted at sense or lemma level
(column 3), and the NL processors that are necessary in each case.
Scenario 1 in Table 4 presents the case in which the nominal lexicon (AnCora-
Nom in our case) is available and the nominalization candidate is an entry in this
lexicon. The sentence where the nominalization candidate occurs is POS-tagged and
no other NL processes are carried out.26 In this case, we apply the ADN-Classifier with
a model learned using only features coming from the lexicon at the lemma level with
Acclemma;lex accuracy. Scenario 2 is the same as Scenario 1 but adds a WSD process to
the nominalization candidate with AccWSD accuracy. In this case, we apply the ADN-
Classifier with a model learned using only lexicon features at a sense level achiev-
ing Accsense;lex accuracy. Obviously, applying this model is only useful if Acclemma;lex−
Accsense;lex outperforms the expected WSD error (1 − AccWSD). Scenario 3 is the same as
Scenario 1 but adds constituent parsing with Accparser accuracy. In this case, we apply the
ADN-Classifier with a model learned using lexicon and corpus features27 at lemma level
with Acclemma;lex+corpus accuracy. Again, this model is only useful if the Acclemma;lex+corpus−
Acclemma;lex outperforms the expected parsing error (1 − Accparser). Scenario 4 consists of
a combination of Scenarios 2 and 3. Scenarios 5, 6, 7, and 8 reproduce Scenarios 1, 2, 3,
and 4, respectively, without using the features extracted from the AnCora-Verb lexicon,
so obtaining the origin verb of the candidate is not necessary. In Scenario 9, the nominal
lexicon is not available or the nominalization candidate is a noun that does not occur
in the nominal lexicon, and only the features extracted from the parsed tree at lemma
level are used. Finally, Scenario 10 is the same as Scenario 9 but adds an SRL process
in order to obtain argument structure information. Taking into account these two sets
of requirements the final version of the ADN-Classifier (R3) has been built.
We used ML techniques to build the ADN-Classifier. Specifically, we used the
J48.Part rule-based classifier, the rule version of the decision-tree classifier C4.5.Rules
(Quinlan 1993) as implemented in the Weka toolbox (Witten and Frank 2005). We chose
a rule-based classifier because it provides a natural representation of classification rules,
thus allowing for the inspection of the model without diminishing accuracy and it

Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations
allows us to perform a ranking of the individualized rules and a definition of a thresh-
olding mechanism for performing a precision oriented classification. Because most of
the features are binary and the others are discrete with small range values, using more
complex rule-based classifiers such as Cohen’s Ripper supposes no real improvement
over our choice.28
The ADN-Classifier therefore consists of the J48.Part classifier within the Weka
toolbox, the appropriate learned model (from the set described in Section 7.2 and listed
in Table 5), and the list of features to be used. During the exploitation phase the input to
the system consists of a table. Each row in the table corresponds to a case for classifying
and each column to the values of the corresponding feature. The result of the process
is a column vector containing the result of classifying each instance.

In order to validate the performance of the ADN-Classifier, a sequence of experiments
was conducted. Concretely, two sets of experiments were carried out: we experimented
with different models of the classifier structured in five dimensions (see Section 7.2) and
we applied the appropriate models in the different scenarios set out in Table 4. We use
a tenfold cross-validation method29 for the evaluation of these two sets of experiments.
In order to evaluate the features selected and to carry out the classification task in each
scenario we used the models learned as described in Section 7.2. As noted earlier, using
the ADN-Classifier for classify involves using the J48.Part classifier within the Weka
toolbox and the appropriate learned model.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.927409">
7.2 Experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999836">
The experiments carried out with the ADN-Classifier-R3 are presented here. Firstly,
we describe those experiments related to the different models of the classifier and
secondly, we focus on how some of these models are applied in different scenarios.
We apply the ADN-Classifier in different modes that correspond to the following five
dimensions.
28 J48.Part learns first a decision tree and then builds the rules traversing all the branches of the tree. Ripper,
instead, learns the rules one by one (increasing the learning cost). This can result in a more accurate and
smaller rule set just in the case of splitting numerical attributes; that is not our case.
29 In n-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into n subsamples. Of the n
subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the
remaining n − 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated n
times (the folds), with each of the n subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The n results
from the folds can then be averaged (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. The
advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling is that all observations are used for
both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once. n is commonly
set to 10 (McLachlan, Do, and Ambroise 2004).

– Application level. We distinguish between sense-based and lemma-based mod-
els. Sense-based models use the information from the AnCora-Nom-R3 lexicon at sense
level, that is, the features for learning (and classification) are associated with the specific
senses. In contrast, in lemma-based models, when extracting features from the lexicon,
we use as features for learning and classification those attributes whose values are
shared by all senses of the same lemma. Therefore, at this second level of application
the features are not so informative but, at the same time, we reduce our dependence
on the lexicon, which was a step that had to be taken to move towards a more realistic
scenario.
– Unit of learning and classification (i.e., the instance to be classified). These
sense- or lemma-based models are in turn distinguished depending on whether the
unit of learning and classification comes from the lexicon (sense or lemma) or from the

AnCora-ES corpus (examples), that is, if they correspond to types or tokens. In the first
case all the features come from the lexicon, whereas in the latter contextual features,
extracted from the corpus, can also be used. Consequently, in sense-based models the
units used are senses (from the lexicon) or examples (from the corpus), and in lemma-
based models they are lemmas (from the lexicon) or examples (from the corpus). It has
to be taken into account that depending on this dimension, the number of instances
for learning varies: There are more senses than lemmas in the lexicon and there are
more nominalization occurrences (examples) in the corpus than nominalization senses
or lemmas in the lexicon.
– Features involved. The features used for both learning and classifying are ob-
tained from the lexicon (lexical features) or from the corpus (contextual features). The
different models are distinguished by using only lexical features, only contextual fea-
tures, or the combination of both types of features.
– Vocabulary size. The data sets taken into account correspond to a reduced set of
817 nominalization lemmas obtained from the 100kw subset of the corpus used for the
first version of the ADN-Classifier (R1) or to the full set of 1,655 nominalization lemmas
occurring in the whole AnCora-ES (500kw). Depending on this dimension, the number
of instances for learning also vary.
– Corpus size. Two corpus sets are used in the different models: a reduced subset
of 100kw used for the first version of the ADN-Classifier (R1) or the full 500kw corre-
sponding to the whole corpus.30 Depending on this dimension, the number of instances
for learning also vary.
In order to identify the models as presented in Table 5, we use five letters as
notation, each of which identifies one of these five dimensions. The first letter corre-
sponds to the application level: If the model is sense-based an S will be used for the
identification and an L in the case of lemma-based models. The second letter refers
to the unit of classification and is L for lemmas, S for senses, and E for examples. In
the third position the reference to the origin of the features involved in the model is
found: L (from the lexicon), C (from the corpus), A (from both resources, all features).
In fourth place, we refer to the vocabulary size: R (reduced) stands for the reduced
set of 817 nominalization lemmas and F (full) for the full set of 1,655 nominalization
lemmas. In last place, we also designate the corpus size by an R (reduced set of
100kw) or an F (full set of 500kw). Therefore a lemma-based model that uses examples
as units of classification, uses all the features, the whole vocabulary, and the whole
corpus is identified as the LEAFF model. In total we experimented with 32 different
models.31
For the different scenarios described in Section 6, we applied the appropriate
models so as not to use the noninformed features for each one.

used (column 1), the number of instances used for learning (column 2), the number of
attributes used, and the number of rules built by the classifier (columns 3 and 4), and
finally, the baseline, the accuracy, the decrease error over the baseline (∆-error), and the
relative error-reduction ratio (Red-∆-error) obtained by each model (columns 5, 6, 7,
and 8). The rows correspond to the different models presented. Recall that the names
of the models are assigned according to the five dimensions presented in Section 7.2.
It should be borne in mind here that in column 2, the number of instances for learning
depends on the type of unit used for learning and classification (senses in sense-based
models, lemmas in lemma-based models, and examples) and on the vocabulary and
corpus size. The interaction between these three dimensions also explains why the
figures for the baseline change for each model. The baseline is a majority baseline
which assigns all the instances to the result class. In general, when the unit used is
from the lexicon, the lemma baseline increases relative to the sense baseline. This is
because in lemma-based models we group the senses that share all the features under
a lemma; because different senses do not normally share all the features, in the end,
only monosemic lemmas are in fact taken into account. This fact, therefore, shows that
there are more result type monosemic lemmas than event and underspecified monosemic
lemmas. Furthermore, it is worth noting that when the unit of learning and classifi-
cation used are the examples from the AnCora-ES corpus and not the senses from
the lexicon, the baseline also increases. Therefore, it seems that proportionally result
nominalizations are more highly represented in the corpus than event and underspecified
nominalizations. Regarding the number of features used for learning, the type of feature
involved and the vocabulary size (when features from the lexicon are used) are the two
relevant dimensions. Finally, it should be said that the accuracy and the other two cor-
related measures are obtained by evaluating the performance of the different models by
tenfold cross-validation.
As can be seen in Table 5, the sense-based models (the first 16 rows) outperform
the corresponding lemma-based models (the last 16 rows). This is explained by the fact
that there are features in the lexicon coded at the sense level that cannot be recovered
at the lemma level because in lemma-based models we only use as features for the
classification those attributes whose values are shared by all senses of the same lemma,
and this does not commonly happen. At the sense level, the best results are achieved
when the features used in the classification come exclusively from the lexicon, with
the unit of classification being senses from the lexicon (the first block of four rows)
or examples from the corpus (the second block of four rows). The contextual features
(those coming from the corpus) can only be applied to models using examples from the
corpus as the unit of classification. These features harm accuracy: When they are used
alone (the third block of rows) they yield accuracy values that are below the baseline
and when they are used in combination with features obtained from the lexicon (the
fourth block of rows) the accuracy decreases in relation to the models that use only
the lexicon as the source of the features (the second block of four rows). This shows
that there is crucial information in the lexicon that is not possible to recover from the
corpus. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that there is a generalized improvement
across sense-based models correlated to the vocabulary and especially corpus size: The
bigger the set of vocabulary and corpus, the better the result. This fact is also present
in lemma-based models.
The sense-based models represent the upper bounds for our task. In a realistic
scenario, however, given the state-of-the-art results in WSD, we would not have access
to sense labels, so we are much more interested in the performance of lemma-based
models. The best results are achieved when features from the lexicon and from the

corpus are combined (the last block of rows), showing that the sum of both types of
features gives rise to positive results, which are not achieved by lexical features or
contextual features on their own. When the features used in the classification come
exclusively from the lexicon, with the unit of classification being lemmas from the
lexicon (the fifth block of four rows) or the examples from the corpus (the sixth block
of four rows), the results are negative (below the baseline) except when the vocabulary
and corpus size are both the full sets (1.54% and 0.16% improvement, respectively).
In these cases, the information from the lexicon is not as accurate as in sense-based
models. The contextual features alone do not achieve positive results, not even with the
full vocabulary and the full corpus. Therefore, the combination of features is needed in
a realistic scenario in order to achieve good performance of the classifier. In these cases,
only when the reduced vocabulary and the reduced corpus are used are the results
slightly negative. From now on, we will focus on the last model (LEAFF) because even
if it has a lower accuracy than the corresponding sense-model, we expect it to exhibit a
more robust behavior when tackling unseen data.
An important point for the classifier to learn a model is whether or not the sample
size is large enough for accurate learning. We performed a learning curve analysis of
the LEAFF model for different sample sizes (from 1,000 examples to the whole set
of 23,431 examples). The results are depicted in Figure 3. We have also plotted the
confidence intervals at 95%. The results seem to imply that for sizes over 5,000 examples
the accuracy tends to stabilize; we are, therefore, highly confident of our results. As
expected, the confidence intervals consistently diminish as the corpus grows.

Precision/coverage plot for different rules thresholding of the SEAFR model.
Additionally, we performed a precision oriented experiment based on a classifier
aiming to achieve a high precision at the cost of a drop in coverage. In order to do this,
we scored each of the rules in the rule set from the LEAFF model of the ADN-Classifier
individually (not taking into account the order of such rules). We sorted the rules in the
rule set by their individual scores, provided by the Weka toolbox, and built a classifier
based on a thresholding mechanism: Only the rules over the threshold were applied.
This resulted in higher precision at the cost of lower coverage. The LEAFF model, as
presented in Table 5, consists of 981 rules obtaining an overall accuracy of 87.20%. The
results of the application of the n most accurate rules, for n from 981 to 1, are depicted
in Figure 4. Note that removing the 500 least accurate rules has a small effect on the
coverage and the overall precision has risen to 94%. An additional reduction of 200
rules results in an increase of the overall precision to 96.5% at a cost of a drop in the
coverage to 90%. Using only the 100 most accurate rules obtains a precision of 98.5%
for a still useful coverage of 80%.

the features that each model uses and that fit the best in each scenario according to
the hypothesized available linguistic processors. When there is no concrete model to
project how the ADN-Classifier would perform in a concrete scenario, we selected the
model that fits approximately in that scenario and removed the noninformed features.
For instance, Scenario 10 describes the case where the nominal lexicon is not available
or the nominalization candidate is a noun that does not occur in the nominal lexicon,
and the features used are extracted from the parsed tree at lemma level and from the
SRL process in order to obtain argument structure information. Because we do not
have a model that perfectly fits in that scenario, we select the LEAFF (lemma based
model using examples from the corpus as the unit of classification and obtaining the
features from both lexicon and corpus, with full vocabulary and full corpus sets), and
we removed all the features from the lexicon except the ones related to the argument
structure, simulating an SRL process.32
These results show that the difference between lemma-based and sense-based mod-
els shown in Table 5 is also present here. There is a decrease in accuracy in all the cases
in which features are removed, although this decrease is not statistically significant.
This could be due to the large number of features available for rule learning and the
possibility of using alternate features when some of the original ones are removed.

The rate of error is almost equally split between the three main classes: incorrectly

73% (676 instances) were classified as result; 26% (242 instances) as underspecified, and a
marginal 3% (2 instances) as lexicalized nominalizations. These errors are attributable to
four main causes. Firstly, 27% of the errors are in fact human errors,34 which means that
the ADN-Classifier performed well. Secondly, the annotation guidelines contain criteria
that the ADN-Classifier cannot recognize: the paraphrase criterion, the agent criterion,
and the so-called selectors (see Section 4.2). These errors represent 51% of the wrongly
classified events. Therefore, there were cases (a total of 61) where manual annotators
had an extra criterion that the ADN-Classifier could not use. We thought that imple-
menting the selectors as features in the ADN-Classifier would be an excessively ad hoc
approach. Thirdly, an error of 21% in event classification is explained because there are a
number of criteria, implemented as features in the ADN-Classifier, that suffer from data
sparseness, and, therefore, the ADN-Classifier cannot learn them as being as relevant
as they are. For instance, a very conclusive clue for detecting event nominalizations is
that they are specified by a possessive determiner that is interpreted as an arg1-patient.
And, finally, the cases in which the ADN-Classifier annotated event nominalizations as
lexicalized constructions are explained by the ADN-Classifier confusing them with real
lexicalized constructions in which the lemma is shared (an error rate of 1%).
Among result nominalizations incorrectly classified by the ADN-Classifier, 56%
(575 instances) were classified as event, 39% (397 instances) as underspecified, and 5%
(54 instances) as lexicalized nominalizations. These errors are attributable to the same
four causes set out above. The rate of human errors is now 51%, however, meaning that
there are event and underspecified nominalizations that were incorrectly validated. The
rate of errors explained by the selectors is now just 10% because there are more selectors
for identifying event than for detecting result nominalizations. And finally, an error rate
of 37% is explained by those criteria that are implemented as features of the ADN-
Classifier, but which suffer from data sparseness, and, therefore, despite their relevance,
cannot be learned by the ADN-Classifier. In the case of result nominalizations, there
are more criteria of this type: nominalizations deriving from unergative and stative
verb classes, relational adjectives as arguments, and temporal arguments realized by
a PP introduced by de (‘of’). And finally, the cases in which the classifier annotated
result nominalizations as lexicalized constructions are explained by the ADN-Classifier
confusing them with real lexicalized constructions in which the lemma is shared (an
error rate of 2%).

34 When comparing automatic annotation with the manual validation, some cases were considered to be
doubtful. We discussed those cases with all the annotators and decided which annotation (automatic or
human) was the correct one. Therefore, by human errors we mean those incorrectly classified in the
manual validation process.

Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations
Among incorrectly classified underspecified nominalizations, 32% (309 instances)
were classified as events, 67% (643 instances) as results, and a marginal 1% (7 instances)
as lexicalized nominalizations. The difficulty in identifying underspecified nominaliza-
tions is to be expected, given that these are either cases with no clear contextual hints
or truly ambiguous examples. In this case, the rate of human error is 45%. Although
there are no selectors that identify underspecified nominalizations, in some cases an NP
containing a nominalization presents contradictory criteria. For instance, an indefinite
determiner is a criterion that points to a result denotation and the selector durante (‘dur-
ing’) typically selects an event denotation. In these cases, the annotators were instructed
to tag them as underspecified. The ADN-Classifier could not use the selectors in its
classification, however, and most of these cases therefore were annotated as results. This
type of error represents 19% of the incorrectly classified underspecified nominalizations.
The agent criterion explains an error rate of 20%. If both types of PPs (introduced by the
preposition por [‘by’] or introduced by the preposition de [‘of’]) are valid for the NP
the annotators were validating, they tagged the nominalization as underspecified type.
Again, human annotators had an extra criterion that the ADN-Classifier could not use.
The remaining 5% is explained by the failure of the ADN-Classifier to detect a pattern
that is typical of underspecified nominalizations: those derived from an achievement verb
with an arg1-patient. And finally, the cases in which the ADN-Classifier annotated
underspecified nominalizations as lexicalized constructions are explained by the ADN-
Classifier confusing them with real lexicalized constructions in which the lemma is
shared (an error rate of 1%).
Most incorrectly classified lexicalized constructions (96%, 90 instances) were clas-
sified as result nominalizations. This is probably due to the fact that most nominal
lexicalized nominalizations are of the result type. Therefore, the key failure of the
ADN-Classifier is basically in distinguishing between the different types of lexicalized
constructions.

8. Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999816263157895">
Although there are several works that contemplate the computational treatment of
nominalizations, most of them are basically interested in two issues: 1) automatically
classifying semantic relations between nominals (Task 4 of SemEval 2007 [Girju et al.
2009] and Task 8 of SemEval 2010 [Hendrickx et al. 2010]) or in noun compound
constructions (Girju et al. [2005] and Task 9 of SemEval 2010 [Butnariu et al. 2010a,
2010b]); and 2) taking advantage of verbal data to interpret, represent, and assign
semantic roles to complements of nominalizations (Hull and Gomez 2000; Lapata 2002;
Pad´o, Pennacchiotti, and Sporleder 2008; Gurevich and Waterman 2009). Although most
of these works show a certain awareness of the linguistic distinction between event
and result nominalizations, none of them applies this distinction in their systems. The
notion of event appears in the work of Creswell et al. (2006), in which a classifier that
distinguishes between nominal mentions of events and non-events is presented. Their
distinction is not comparable to our event and result distinction for one main reason,
however: they do not focus on nominalizations but on nouns in general, and therefore
the difficulty in distinguishing events from non-events among all types of nouns is less
than distinguishing between event and result nominalizations, which, as has been seen,
are highly ambiguous. We state that it is easier because in a wide nominal domain there
are many nouns which under any circumstance can be understood as non-dynamic (in
fact, nouns tend to denote objects, non-events) and if Creswell et al. include as seed for

learning these types of nouns, such as airport or electronics, it will necessarily increase
the accuracy of the automatic distinction between their two denotation types.
As far as we know, the only work closely related to ours is that of Eberle, Faasz,
and Ulrich (2011) who are working on German –ung nominalizations, in which the
assignment of a denotation type is also carried out. In that paper they state that this
kind of nominalization can denote an event, a state, or an object. Specifically, they analyze
those –ung nominalizations derived from verbs of saying embedded in PPs introduced
by the preposition nach (‘to’). According to the authors, these nominalizations can
denote either an event or a proposition, which is a type of object. They present a semantic
analysis tool (Eberle et al. 2008) which disambiguates this type of nominalization on the
basis of nine criteria, which they call indicators. The tool extracts the indicators from
the semantic representation that it provides and computes the preferred denotation
according to a pre-established weighting schema. They apply this tool to a set of 100
sentences where the relevant material (the nine indicators) is completely familiar to the
system and the tool recognizes the preferred reading in 82% of cases.
Because the ADN-Classifier is based on ML techniques and does not restrict the
nominalizations to a specific suffix and to those derived from verbs of saying, their
work is not directly comparable to ours. We tried to replicate their experiment, however,
selecting only those nominalizations created with the suffix -ci´on (the most productive
Spanish suffix and the nearest equivalent to –ung in German) and which derive from
verbs of saying. The subset obtained includes 66 types of nominalizations, compared
with the 1,655 in our work. We applied the LEAFF model to the 719 tokens of these
66 nominalization types and we obtained an accuracy of 85.6%. This implies a 3.6
percentage point increase in accuracy with respect to the results of their work, despite
the fact that our model is not trained on this specific nominalization class and does not
dispose of specially designed indicators. We have to take this result with due caution
because we are dealing with two not closely related languages and considering a close
but not identical set of nominalizations.

This article contributes to the semantic analysis of texts focusing on Spanish deverbal
nominalizations. We base our study on theoretical hypotheses that we analyze empir-
ically, and as a result we have developed three new resources: the ADN-Classifier, the
first tool that allows for the automatic classification of deverbal nouns as event or result
types; the AnCora-ES corpus enriched with the annotation of deverbal nominalizations
according to their semantic denotation, being in fact the only Spanish corpus which
incorporates this information; and the AnCora-Nom lexicon, a resource containing
1,655 deverbal nominalizations linked to their occurrences in the AnCora-ES corpus.
These resources could be very useful for NLP applications. The work presented in this
article also provides an additional insight into the linguistic question underlying it:
The characterization of deverbal nominalizations according to their denotation and the
identification of the most useful criteria to distinguish between these denotation types.
We can classify our contributions in three directions:
1) The study of the relevant features for the classification of a nominalization
as being of event or result type. The set of features considered were selected from
the linguistics literature, mostly devoted to the English language, and its relevance
was established empirically for Spanish. From the corpus-based study, we concluded
that not all the criteria posited for English seem to port to Spanish. Among the

evaluated criteria, the most relevant for distinguishing between event and result nomi-
nalizations are: 1) the semantic class of the verb from which the noun is derived;
2) its pluralization capacity; 3) its determiner types; 4) the preposition introducing an
agentive complement; and 5) the obligatory presence of an internal argument. These
features are represented as attributes in the nominal lexical entries of the AnCora-Nom
lexicon. Models including features coming from the lexicon outperform those that only
take into account features from the corpus. As expected, models working at the sense
level outperform those working at the lemma level. When working at the lemma level
only the combination of features from both the lexicon and the corpus provides results
that outperform the baseline. It is interesting to note that the number of features used to
support result nominalizations is significantly superior to those used to strengthen event
nominalizations. In each criterion we find features for supporting result nominalizations
but not event nominalizations. As a result, the ADN-Classifier uses more features for
detecting result than event nominalizations, and therefore achieves a greater degree
of accuracy on the former than in the latter. Furthermore, the corpus base study has
allowed us to find new clues that support denotation types, especially the event reading.
The paraphrase and agent criteria, as well as the selectors, have proved very useful
to human annotators for distinguishing between an event and a result reading. These
criteria are difficult to implement automatically, however.
2) Lexical resources derived from this work. We have enriched the AnCora-ES
corpus with the annotation of 23,431 deverbal nominalization occurrences according to
their semantic denotation; and we have built AnCora-Nom from scratch, representing
the 1,655 nominalization types that correspond to these occurrences.
3) The ADN-Classifier. This classifier is the first tool that aims to automatically
classify deverbal nominalizations in event, result, or underspecified denotation types, and
to identify whether the nominalization takes part in a lexicalized construction in Spanish.
We set up a series of experiments in order to test the ADN-Classifier under different
models and in different realistic scenarios, achieving good results. The ADN-Classifier
has helped us to quantitatively evaluate the validity of our claims regarding deverbal
nominalizations. An error analysis was performed and its conclusions can be used to
pursue further lines of improvements.
Further work. Two of the main sources of error found in the performance of the
ADN-Classifier are data sparseness of some of the features (such as PP agent) and the
fact that there are criteria at the disposal of human annotators that the ADN-Classifier
is unable to detect. In order to reduce the problem of data sparseness it would be
interesting to look for some linguistic generalizations of the sparse features in order to
implement a backoff mechanism. Another line of future work is to analyze the criteria
used by human annotators and not currently implemented either in the lexicon or in the
corpus. Some additional features could be incorporated in the Classifier. Among them
are path-based syntactic patterns that have been applied with success to related tasks
(see Gildea and Palmer 2002).
We have also experimented with a meta-classifier working on the results of binary
classifiers (one for each class). The global accuracy of the meta-classifier was not greater
than that of the current ADN. We think, however, that a binary classifier for the
underspecified type (the most difficult one) could result in improvements. Most of the
considerations regarding the scenarios described in Table 4 are based on a crude global
evaluation of complementary NL processors such as a word sense disambiguator; for

example, a specific scenario can be followed when the global accuracy of the NL pro-
cessor crosses a given threshold. A more precise approach can also be adopted. Con-
sider, for instance, the WSD task instead of a simple classifier providing a global
accuracy—a regressor can provide individual scores of accuracy for each case (de-
gree of confidence, margin, probability of correct classification, etc.). This more precise
approach can lead to new scenarios incorporating hybrid models.
The last point of future work consists in analyzing to what extent the ADN-
Classifier and its models are applicable to other languages. Concretely, because we have
a similar corpus for Catalan (lacking deverbal nominalization information) we plan to
apply the models learned for Spanish to this closely related Romance language.

In Example (9), the result interpretation is due to the fact that the verb base of tendencia, ‘trend,’ denotes a state, so the noun inherits the property of stativity (non-dynamicity) and does not imply any change. In this sense, our notions of event and result are equivalent to the complex-event and result nominalizations, respectively, in the terminology of Grimshaw (1990)3 or the terms process and result used in Pustejovsky (1995)4 and Alexiadou (2001). Although the event vs. result distinction we make is widespread, it is true that event and result nominalizations can also be represented in a more fine-grained way. For instance, Eberle, Faasz, and Heid (2009) distinguish between events (messung, ‘measurement’), states (teilung, ‘division’), and objects (lieferung, ‘furnished material’) in German nominalizations, and Balvet, Barque, and Marin (2010) propose a typology of French nominalizations that contemplates four aspectual types: states (admiration, ‘admiration’), durative events (op´eration, ‘operation’), punctual events (explosion, ‘ex</context>

The authors working on this topic mainly differ on two issues. On the one hand, they do not agree on how to consider (and therefore, how to represent) these two denotations: as two senses of the same lexical unit (Pustejovsky 1995; Badia 2002; Alonso 2004) or as two different lexical units (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001). Regarding this denotative distinction, several linguistic criteria have been proposed in order to identify each of these denotations, mostly for English, although there are some proposals for Spanish (Picallo 1999), French, Greek, Russian, and Polish (Alexiadou 2001) (see Table 2 in Section 4.1). On the other hand, authors differ on the argument-taking capacity of deverbal nominalizations: Some linguists maintain that only event deverbal nominalizations can take arguments (Zubizarreta 1987; Grimshaw 1990), whereas others consider that both event and result nominalizations can take arguments </context>

In Alexiadou (2001) and Picallo (1999), the idea that event and result nominalizations are different lexical units is justified by the different functional projection of these two types of nominalization and by word-formation at different levels of the language,5 respectively. In contrast to Grimshaw, however, they state that both types of nominalizations can select arguments. In the words of Alexiadou (2001, page 69): “Given that there is no lexical difference between verbs and process nouns, and between result and process nouns, apart from the functional domain, all can take arguments.” Picallo also believes that complements of result nominalizations are arguments when argumental relationships can be established between them and the nominal head.

The fact that AnCora-ES is annotated with different linguistic information levels allowed for the evaluation of the seven morphosyntactic and semantic criteria selected. Next, we briefly present each criterion, how they were applied, and the results obtained.10 4.1.1 Verbal Class. One of the most commonly used criterion to determine the denotation is the verbal class from which the nominalization is derived (Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001; Badia 2002). It is claimed that unergative and stative verbs give rise to result nominalizations, and unaccusative verbs usually result in ambiguous, or what we call underspecified, nominalizations. Regarding transitive verbs, they give rise to either event, result, or underspecified nominalizations. To analyze this criterion, we set out from the semantic verbal classification proposed in AnCora-Verb. In this verbal lexicon, each predicate is associated with one or more semantic classes depending on the four basic types of events (Vendler 1967) (accomplishments which correspond to transitive</context>

Regarding transitive and unaccusative verbs, they lead to event, result, or underspecified nominalizations. It is also interesting to remark that event nominalizations derive mostly from transitive verbs (15%, in contrast to the 1% derived from achievement verbs) and underspecified nominalizations derive from unaccusative verbs (28%, in contrast to the 11% and 3% derived from transitive and state verbs, respectively), confirming the hypothesis stated by Picallo (1999), Alexiadou (2001), and Badia (2002). 4.1.2 Pluralization.

Specifically, Pustejovsky accounts for the event-result ambiguity in nominalizations by means of an underspecified lexical representation called dotobject, arguing that event-result nominalizations are cases of complementary polysemy: “both senses of a logically polysemous noun seem relevant for the interpretation of the noun in the context, but one sense seems ‘focused’ for purposes of a particular context” (Pustejovsky 1995, page 31).

The distinctions established in WordNet and FrameNet are more similar to the one proposed in OntoNotes. To sum up, the event vs. result distinction in deverbal nominalizations has received much attention in linguistics literature.

In contrast, the singular feature is not informative enough to discard any of the nominal denotations (69% of the nominalizations were classified as results, 15% as events, and 16% as underspecified type). Therefore, in the sample analyzed all event nominalizations and most of the underspecified nominalizations appeared only in the singular. 4.1.3 Determiner Types. Authors such as Grimshaw (1990), Picallo (1999), and Alonso (2004) claim that event nominalizations usually appear with definite articles whereas result nominalizations may be specified by all types of determiners. For instance, demonstrative determiners can only specify result nominalizations because this type of determiner is used to refer to an entity in a frame of reference. In order to evaluate this criterion we took into account the types of determiners combining with the nominalization and also whether the noun appeared without a determiner. Because most of the nominal senses were classified as results (72%), it should not surprise us that all types o</context>

The internal argument criterion proposed by Grimshaw (1990) and Picallo (1999) states that only event deverbal nominalizations require the presence of an internal argument because they are more similar to verbs, whereas in resultnominalized NPs the internal argument is not needed. Badia (2002) argues that the realization of this argument is not always compulsory to obtain an event interpretation of the nominalization. To analyze this criterion, we observed those nominalized NPs in which the internal argument was explicit and the type of argument that realized it. As a result, we observed that the majority of event nominalizations are complemented by an internal argument (98%). This is also the case for underspecified nominalizations in a fairly high percentage (78%). The percentage decreases considerably in result nominalizations (34%), however. Therefore, the data seem to confirm </context>
<context position="49366" citStr="Badia 2002" startWordPosition="7452" endWordPosition="7453">shaw’s hypothesis is only partially corroborated because only by-PPs guarantee the event reading. Regarding relational adjectives, Picallo’s thesis is confirmed, because this type of constituent mostly appears as an argument of result nominalizations. Moreover, we observed a preference for possessive determiners to be external arguments of result nominalizations, which is not stated in any of the theoretical proposals. 4.1.7 Verbal Predicates. The type of verbal predicate that can be combined with nominalizations may be an indicator for determining the denotation (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999; Badia 2002). Result nominalizations tend to combine with attributive predicates, whereas event nominalizations tend to be subjects of predicates such as tener lugar (‘to take place’) or ocurrir (‘to happen’) because these predicates tend to select event type subjects. In order to examine this criterion, we analyzed the types of predicates combined with the 817 nominalization types. We observed whether the predicates belong to the event-denoting class (tener lugar, ‘to take place’; ocurrir, ‘to happen’; comenzar, ‘to begin’; acabar, ‘to finish’; durar, ‘to last’; llevar a cabo, ‘to carry out’) or if they </context>

Therefore, a careful examination of the processes, their accuracy, and the improvement of classification accuracy is needed. For instance, performing WSD on the nominalization candidate could allow for the use of sense-based features and, thus, a clear improvement in classification accuracy. The inconvenience is that the state-of-the-art accuracy rate of WSD is not very promising. In recent SemEval challenges, the accuracy rate in All-Words tasks is between 60% and 70% for a baseline of 51.4% using the first sense in WordNet, and 89% in Lexical-Sample tasks for a baseline of 78% (Chklovski and Mihalcea 2002; Decadt et al. 2004; Pradhan et al. 2007).25 These figures depend on the sense inventory used for disambiguation: The All-Words task uses fine-grained senses (WordNet synsets) and the Lexical Sample task uses more coarse-grained sense inventory (Ontonotes senses). Therefore, we approach the problem of classification taking into account different feature sets which come from different knowledge resources, and we examine and evaluate the task performance when a decreasing number of knowledge resources are used.

The ADN-Classifier achieved good results (87.20% accuracy). 1. Introduction The last few years have seen an increasing amount of work in the semantic treatment of unrestricted text, such as Minimal Recursive Semantics in Lingo/LKB (Copestake 2007), Frame Semantics in Shalmaneser (Erk and Pad´o 2006), Discourse Representation Structures in Boxer (Bos 2008), and the automatic learning of Semantic Grammars (Mooney 2007), but we are still a long way from representing the full meaning of texts when not restricted to narrow domains.

Although most of these works show a certain awareness of the linguistic distinction between event and result nominalizations, none of them applies this distinction in their systems. The notion of event appears in the work of Creswell et al. (2006), in which a classifier that distinguishes between nominal mentions of events and non-events is presented. Their distinction is not comparable to our event and result distinction for one main reason, however: they do not focus on nominalizations but on nouns in general, and therefore the difficulty in distinguishing events from non-events among all types of nouns is less than distinguishing between event and result nominalizations, which, as has been seen, are highly ambiguous.

In that paper they state that this kind of nominalization can denote an event, a state, or an object. Specifically, they analyze those –ung nominalizations derived from verbs of saying embedded in PPs introduced by the preposition nach (‘to’). According to the authors, these nominalizations can denote either an event or a proposition, which is a type of object. They present a semantic analysis tool (Eberle et al. 2008) which disambiguates this type of nominalization on the basis of nine criteria, which they call indicators. The tool extracts the indicators from the semantic representation that it provides and computes the preferred denotation according to a pre-established weighting schema. They apply this tool to a set of 100 sentences where the relevant material (the nine indicators) is completely familiar to the system and the tool recognizes the preferred reading in 82% of cases.

See M´arquez et al. (2008) and Palmer, Gildea, and Xue (2010) for recent surveys. Closely related to SRL is the task of learning Selectional Restrictions for a predicate, for example, the kind of semantic class each argument of the predicate must belong to (Mechura 2008). In this case a predefined set of semantic classes must also be used to perform the classification task. WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2006), PropBank (Palmer, Kingsbury, and Gildea 2005), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), and OntoNotes (Hovy et al. 2006) are resources frequently used for this purpose. Most of these efforts are verb-centered and reduce role labeling to the roles played by entities around a predicate instantiated as a verb. At a finer level, there is the task of WSD, for example, assigning the most appropriate sense to each lexical unit of the text from a predefined lexical-semantic resource.

In the middle ground between these two positions, we find the representation models proposed in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998; Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), and Ontonotes (Hovy et al. 2006). WordNet, possibly due to its extremely fine granularity, usually includes among the senses corresponding to deverbal nouns one paraphrased as “the acting of verb x” (our event nominalization) and another paraphrased to something similar to “the thing X-verb+ed” (our result nominalization).

In order to reduce the problem of data sparseness it would be interesting to look for some linguistic generalizations of the sparse features in order to implement a backoff mechanism. Another line of future work is to analyze the criteria used by human annotators and not currently implemented either in the lexicon or in the corpus. Some additional features could be incorporated in the Classifier. Among them are path-based syntactic patterns that have been applied with success to related tasks (see Gildea and Palmer 2002). We have also experimented with a meta-classifier working on the results of binary classifiers (one for each class). The global accuracy of the meta-classifier was not greater than that of the current ADN. We think, however, that a binary classifier for the underspecified type (the most difficult one) could result in improvements.

This is probably due to the fact that most nominal lexicalized nominalizations are of the result type. Therefore, the key failure of the ADN-Classifier is basically in distinguishing between the different types of lexicalized constructions. 8. Related Work Although there are several works that contemplate the computational treatment of nominalizations, most of them are basically interested in two issues: 1) automatically classifying semantic relations between nominals (Task 4 of SemEval 2007 [Girju et al. 2009] and Task 8 of SemEval 2010 [Hendrickx et al. 2010]) or in noun compound constructions (Girju et al.

In Example (9), the result interpretation is due to the fact that the verb base of tendencia, ‘trend,’ denotes a state, so the noun inherits the property of stativity (non-dynamicity) and does not imply any change. In this sense, our notions of event and result are equivalent to the complex-event and result nominalizations, respectively, in the terminology of Grimshaw (1990)3 or the terms process and result used in Pustejovsky (1995)4 and Alexiadou (2001). Although the event vs. result distinction we make is widespread, it is true that event and result nominalizations can also be represented in a more fine-grained way. For instance, Eberle, Faasz, and Heid (2009) distinguish between events (messung, ‘measurement’), states (teilung, ‘division’), and objects (lieferung, ‘furnished material’) in German nominalizations, and Balvet, Barque, and Marin (2010) propose a typology of French nominalizations that contemplates four aspectual types: states (admiration, ‘admira</context>

The authors working on this topic mainly differ on two issues. On the one hand, they do not agree on how to consider (and therefore, how to represent) these two denotations: as two senses of the same lexical unit (Pustejovsky 1995; Badia 2002; Alonso 2004) or as two different lexical units (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001). Regarding this denotative distinction, several linguistic criteria have been proposed in order to identify each of these denotations, mostly for English, although there are some proposals for Spanish (Picallo 1999), French, Greek, Russian, and Polish (Alexiadou 2001) (see Table 2 in Section 4.1). On the other hand, authors differ on the argument-taking capacity of deverbal nominalizations: Some linguists maintain that only event deverbal nominalizations can take arguments (Zubizarreta 1987; Grimshaw 1990), whereas others consider that both event and result nomi</context>

Regarding transitive and unaccusative verbs, they lead to event, result, or underspecified nominalizations. It is also interesting to remark that event nominalizations derive mostly from transitive verbs (15%, in contrast to the 1% derived from achievement verbs) and underspecified nominalizations derive from unaccusative verbs (28%, in contrast to the 11% and 3% derived from transitive and state verbs, respectively), confirming the hypothesis stated by Picallo (1999), Alexiadou (2001), and Badia (2002). 4.1.2 Pluralization. According to Grimshaw (1990) and Alonso (2004), one of the features that clearly identifies result nominalizations is their pluralization capacity because it is 10 In the following criteria we do not consider lexicalized senses because the criteria do not apply to these complex lexical units. 838 Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations more usual to quantify objects than events. It is important to point out, however, that it is also possible to make an event reading of a plural nominalization. For instance, in Example (11) bombardeos (‘shelling’) refers to multiple ac</context>
<context position="41851" citStr="Grimshaw (1990)" startWordPosition="6332" endWordPosition="6333">zed. The results obtained (98% of the nominalizations in the plural were classified as result and the remaining 2% as underspecified) confirmed plurality as one of the features able to detect result nominalizations. In contrast, the singular feature is not informative enough to discard any of the nominal denotations (69% of the nominalizations were classified as results, 15% as events, and 16% as underspecified type). Therefore, in the sample analyzed all event nominalizations and most of the underspecified nominalizations appeared only in the singular. 4.1.3 Determiner Types. Authors such as Grimshaw (1990), Picallo (1999), and Alonso (2004) claim that event nominalizations usually appear with definite articles whereas result nominalizations may be specified by all types of determiners. For instance, demonstrative determiners can only specify result nominalizations because this type of determiner is used to refer to an entity in a frame of reference. In order to evaluate this criterion we took into account the types of determiners combining with the nominalization and also whether the noun appeared without a determiner. Because most of the nominal senses were classified as results (72%), it shou</context>

The internal argument criterion proposed by Grimshaw (1990) and Picallo (1999) states that only event deverbal nominalizations require the presence of an internal argument because they are more similar to verbs, whereas in resultnominalized NPs the internal argument is not needed. Badia (2002) argues that the realization of this argument is not always compulsory to obtain an event interpretation of the nominalization. To analyze this criterion, we observed those nominalized NPs in which the internal argument was explicit and the type of argument that realized it. As a result, we observed that the majority of event nominalizations are complemented by a</context>

Relative pronouns only occur with event (29%) and result (71%) denotation types, and, finally relational adjectives occur nearly exclusively in result nominalizations (97%). This last fact constitutes an identification feature for result nominalizations, as Picallo states (see next criterion). Table 3 shows the results obtained for each criterion. 4.1.6 External Arguments vs. Possessors. Grimshaw (1990) states that PPs introduced by the preposition ‘by’ (by-PPs), relational adjectives, and possessive determiners in English would be interpreted as external arguments (subjects) in the case of event nominalized NPs. These constituents, however, would be interpreted as possessors (that is, as non-argumental) in result nominalized NPs. Other authors, like Picallo (1999), nevertheless, claim that possessive determiners may be argumental in result and event nominalizations in Spanish. Regarding relational adjectives, Picallo argues that these constituents can only be arguments of result nominalizat</context>
<context position="49339" citStr="Grimshaw 1990" startWordPosition="7448" endWordPosition="7449"> Therefore, for Spanish, Grimshaw’s hypothesis is only partially corroborated because only by-PPs guarantee the event reading. Regarding relational adjectives, Picallo’s thesis is confirmed, because this type of constituent mostly appears as an argument of result nominalizations. Moreover, we observed a preference for possessive determiners to be external arguments of result nominalizations, which is not stated in any of the theoretical proposals. 4.1.7 Verbal Predicates. The type of verbal predicate that can be combined with nominalizations may be an indicator for determining the denotation (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999; Badia 2002). Result nominalizations tend to combine with attributive predicates, whereas event nominalizations tend to be subjects of predicates such as tener lugar (‘to take place’) or ocurrir (‘to happen’) because these predicates tend to select event type subjects. In order to examine this criterion, we analyzed the types of predicates combined with the 817 nominalization types. We observed whether the predicates belong to the event-denoting class (tener lugar, ‘to take place’; ocurrir, ‘to happen’; comenzar, ‘to begin’; acabar, ‘to finish’; durar, ‘to last’; llevar a cabo, </context>

Closely related to SRL is the task of learning Selectional Restrictions for a predicate, for example, the kind of semantic class each argument of the predicate must belong to (Mechura 2008). In this case a predefined set of semantic classes must also be used to perform the classification task.

From a theoretical point of view, it is stated that this denotative distinction may have repercussions on the argument-taking capability of deverbal nominalizations. Despite being aware of this distinction, computational approaches focus on event nominalizations, not taking into account the result ones or, more frequently, without characterizing the difference. For instance, SRL systems are mostly applied to event nominalizations (Pradhan et al. 2004; Erk and Pad´o 2006; Liu and Ng 2007). Result nominalizations are more frequent than the event types, however, at least in Spanish (1,845 event occurrences in contrast to 20,037 result occurrences in AnCora-ES). In the present work, we hypothesize that result nominalizations, like event nominalizations, can take arguments; therefore, discarding result nominalizations would imply a loss of semantic information, equally relevant to text representation. In this article, we focus our interest on this denotative distinction. Concretely, we aim to determine the relevant linguistic information required to classify deverbal nominalizatio</context>

This is the case, for instance, in Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) systems, which indicate the semantic relations that hold between a predicate and its associated participants and properties, the relations of which are drawn from a pre-specified list of possible semantic roles for that predicate or class of predicates. See M´arquez et al. (2008) and Palmer, Gildea, and Xue (2010) for recent surveys. Closely related to SRL is the task of learning Selectional Restrictions for a predicate, for example, the kind of semantic class each argument of the predicate must belong to (Mechura 2008). In this case a predefined set of semantic classes must also be used to perform the classification task. WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2006), PropBank (Palmer, Kingsbury, and Gildea 2005), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), and OntoNotes (Hovy et al. 2006) are resources frequently used for this purpose.

Once again a catalogue of classes has to be used as a range for the assignment.1 In this case as well, despite its excessive finer granularity, WordNet is the most widely used reference. See Navigli (2009) for a recent survey. In this line of research, there has recently been a growing interest in going beyond verb-centered hypotheses to tackle the computational treatment of deverbal nominalizations (nouns derived from verbs), in order to move forward to the full comprehension of texts. Deverbal nominalizations are lexical units that contain rich semantic information equivalent to a clausal structure. Many recent studies have focused on the detection of semantic relations between pairs of nominals that belong to different Nominal Phrases (NPs), such as Task 4 of SemEval 2007 (Girju et al. 2009)</context>

The authors working on this topic mainly differ on two issues. On the one hand, they do not agree on how to consider (and therefore, how to represent) these two denotations: as two senses of the same lexical unit (Pustejovsky 1995; Badia 2002; Alonso 2004) or as two different lexical units (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001). Regarding this denotative distinction, several linguistic criteria have been proposed in order to identify each of these denotations, mostly for English, although there are some proposals for Spanish (Picallo 1999), French, Greek, Russian, and Polish (Alexiadou 2001) (see Table 2 in Section 4.1). On the other hand, authors differ on the argument-taking capacity of deverbal nominalizations: Some linguists maintain that only event deverbal nominalizations can take arguments (Zubizarreta 1987; Grimshaw 1990), whereas others consider that both event and result nominalizations ca</context>

In relation to argument-taking capacity, both types of nominalizations are argumental because the dot-object representation has an argument structure in which the nominal arguments are specified. 5 In Picallo (1999) it is stated that event nominalizations are created in the syntax whereas result nominalizations are created in the lexicon; therefore they have different derivation processes. 832 Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations Alonso (2004) argues that these nominalizations present a disjunction of meaning because they can update an event and a result reading in the same sentence without the understanding of the sentence being affected.

The fact that AnCora-ES is annotated with different linguistic information levels allowed for the evaluation of the seven morphosyntactic and semantic criteria selected. Next, we briefly present each criterion, how they were applied, and the results obtained.10 4.1.1 Verbal Class. One of the most commonly used criterion to determine the denotation is the verbal class from which the nominalization is derived (Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001; Badia 2002). It is claimed that unergative and stative verbs give rise to result nominalizations, and unaccusative verbs usually result in ambiguous, or what we call underspecified, nominalizations. Regarding transitive verbs, they give rise to either event, result, or underspecified nominalizations. To analyze this criterion, we set out from the semantic verbal classification proposed in AnCora-Verb. In this verbal lexicon, each predicate is associated with one or more semantic classes depending on the four basic types of events (Vendler 1967) (accomplishments which correspo</context>
<context position="40211" citStr="Picallo (1999)" startWordPosition="6084" endWordPosition="6085">sult, however, is that stative and unergative verbs lead nearly exclusively to result nominalizations in Spanish, 97% and 100%, respectively. Regarding transitive and unaccusative verbs, they lead to event, result, or underspecified nominalizations. It is also interesting to remark that event nominalizations derive mostly from transitive verbs (15%, in contrast to the 1% derived from achievement verbs) and underspecified nominalizations derive from unaccusative verbs (28%, in contrast to the 11% and 3% derived from transitive and state verbs, respectively), confirming the hypothesis stated by Picallo (1999), Alexiadou (2001), and Badia (2002). 4.1.2 Pluralization. According to Grimshaw (1990) and Alonso (2004), one of the features that clearly identifies result nominalizations is their pluralization capacity because it is 10 In the following criteria we do not consider lexicalized senses because the criteria do not apply to these complex lexical units. 838 Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations more usual to quantify objects than events. It is important to point out, however, that it is also possible to make an event reading of a plural nomi</context>

In contrast, the singular feature is not informative enough to discard any of the nominal denotations (69% of the nominalizations were classified as results, 15% as events, and 16% as underspecified type). Therefore, in the sample analyzed all event nominalizations and most of the underspecified nominalizations appeared only in the singular. 4.1.3 Determiner Types. Authors such as Grimshaw (1990), Picallo (1999), and Alonso (2004) claim that event nominalizations usually appear with definite articles whereas result nominalizations may be specified by all types of determiners. For instance, demonstrative determiners can only specify result nominalizations because this type of determiner is used to refer to an entity in a frame of reference. In order to evaluate this criterion we took into account the types of determiners combining with the nominalization and also whether the noun appeared without a determiner. Because most of the nominal senses were classified as results (72%), it should not surprise </context>
<context position="43746" citStr="Picallo 1999" startWordPosition="6611" endWordPosition="6612">esult, 5% as events, and 7% as underspecified nominalizations. The data therefore partially confirm the hypotheses from the literature: Result nominalizations appear with a wider range of determiners. Although event nominalizations are not always specified by a definite article, they can also appear with possessive determiners or without any determiner. 4.1.4 Preposition Introducing the Agent. In Spanish nominalizations derived from transitive verbs are considered to be results if the agent complement is introduced by the preposition de (‘of’) and events if the preposition used is por (‘by’) (Picallo 1999).11 We took into consideration agent complements introduced by prepositions appearing in the sample analyzed. As shown in Table 3, Prepositional Phrases (PPs) interpreted as agents in the NPs analyzed are introduced by the following prepositions: de (‘of’), entre (‘between’), por (‘by’), and por parte de (‘by’). We observed that the distribution of the four PPs is complementary between event and result denotations: The agent nominal 11 A similar claim is stated by Badia (2002) for Catalan. 839 Computational Linguistics Volume 38, Number 4 Table 3 Distribution of the denotation types according </context>

The internal argument criterion proposed by Grimshaw (1990) and Picallo (1999) states that only event deverbal nominalizations require the presence of an internal argument because they are more similar to verbs, whereas in resultnominalized NPs the internal argument is not needed. Badia (2002) argues that the realization of this argument is not always compulsory to obtain an event interpretation of the nominalization. To analyze this criterion, we observed those nominalized NPs in which the internal argument was explicit and the type of argument that realized it. As </context>

This last fact constitutes an identification feature for result nominalizations, as Picallo states (see next criterion). Table 3 shows the results obtained for each criterion. 4.1.6 External Arguments vs. Possessors. Grimshaw (1990) states that PPs introduced by the preposition ‘by’ (by-PPs), relational adjectives, and possessive determiners in English would be interpreted as external arguments (subjects) in the case of event nominalized NPs. These constituents, however, would be interpreted as possessors (that is, as non-argumental) in result nominalized NPs. Other authors, like Picallo (1999), nevertheless, claim that possessive determiners may be argumental in result and event nominalizations in Spanish. Regarding relational adjectives, Picallo argues that these constituents can only be arguments of result nominalizations. As seen, there is no consensus among authors; therefore, it seemed to us to be an interesting criterion to contrast.

The type of verbal predicate that can be combined with nominalizations may be an indicator for determining the denotation (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999; Badia 2002). Result nominalizations tend to combine with attributive predicates, whereas event nominalizations tend to be subjects of predicates such as tener lugar (‘to take place’) or ocurrir (‘to happen’) because these predicates tend to select event type subjects. In order to examine this criterion, we analyzed the types of predicates combined with the 817 nominalization types. We observed whether the predicates belong to the event-denoting class (tener lugar, ‘to take place’; ocurrir, ‘to happen’; comenzar, ‘to begin’; acabar, ‘to finish’; durar, ‘to last’; llevar a cabo, ‘to carry out’</context>

From a theoretical point of view, it is stated that this denotative distinction may have repercussions on the argument-taking capability of deverbal nominalizations. Despite being aware of this distinction, computational approaches focus on event nominalizations, not taking into account the result ones or, more frequently, without characterizing the difference. For instance, SRL systems are mostly applied to event nominalizations (Pradhan et al. 2004; Erk and Pad´o 2006; Liu and Ng 2007). Result nominalizations are more frequent than the event types, however, at least in Spanish (1,845 event occurrences in contrast to 20,037 result occurrences in AnCora-ES). In the present work, we hypothesize that result nominalizations, like event nominalizations, can take arguments; therefore, discarding result nominalizations would imply a loss of semantic information, equally relevant to text representation. In this article, we focus our interest on this denotative distinction. Concretely, we aim to determine the relevant linguistic information requi</context>

For instance, performing WSD on the nominalization candidate could allow for the use of sense-based features and, thus, a clear improvement in classification accuracy. The inconvenience is that the state-of-the-art accuracy rate of WSD is not very promising. In recent SemEval challenges, the accuracy rate in All-Words tasks is between 60% and 70% for a baseline of 51.4% using the first sense in WordNet, and 89% in Lexical-Sample tasks for a baseline of 78% (Chklovski and Mihalcea 2002; Decadt et al. 2004; Pradhan et al. 2007).25 These figures depend on the sense inventory used for disambiguation: The All-Words task uses fine-grained senses (WordNet synsets) and the Lexical Sample task uses more coarse-grained sense inventory (Ontonotes senses). Therefore, we approach the problem of classification taking into account different feature sets which come from different knowledge resources, and we examine and evaluate the task performance when a decreasing number of knowledge resources are used.

In Example (9), the result interpretation is due to the fact that the verb base of tendencia, ‘trend,’ denotes a state, so the noun inherits the property of stativity (non-dynamicity) and does not imply any change. In this sense, our notions of event and result are equivalent to the complex-event and result nominalizations, respectively, in the terminology of Grimshaw (1990)3 or the terms process and result used in Pustejovsky (1995)4 and Alexiadou (2001). Although the event vs. result distinction we make is widespread, it is true that event and result nominalizations can also be represented in a more fine-grained way. For instance, Eberle, Faasz, and Heid (2009) distinguish between events (messung, ‘measurement’), states (teilung, ‘division’), and objects (lieferung, ‘furnished material’) in German nominalizations, and Balvet, Barque, and Marin (2010) propose a typology of French nominalizations that contemplates four aspectual types: states (admiration, ‘admiration’), durative events (op´eration, ‘operation’), punctual </context>

The authors working on this topic mainly differ on two issues. On the one hand, they do not agree on how to consider (and therefore, how to represent) these two denotations: as two senses of the same lexical unit (Pustejovsky 1995; Badia 2002; Alonso 2004) or as two different lexical units (Grimshaw 1990; Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001). Regarding this denotative distinction, several linguistic criteria have been proposed in order to identify each of these denotations, mostly for English, although there are some proposals for Spanish (Picallo 1999), French, Greek, Russian, and Polish (Alexiadou 2001) (see Table 2 in Section 4.1). On the other hand, authors differ on the argument-taking capacity of deverbal nominalizations: Some linguists maintain that only event deverbal nominalizations can take arguments (Zubizarreta 19</context>

In the words of Alexiadou (2001, page 69): “Given that there is no lexical difference between verbs and process nouns, and between result and process nouns, apart from the functional domain, all can take arguments.” Picallo also believes that complements of result nominalizations are arguments when argumental relationships can be established between them and the nominal head. In contrast, those who consider both denotations as senses of the same lexical unit maintain that nominalizations are underspecified lexical units (Pustejovsky 1995), units in which a disjunction of meaning is present (Alonso 2004), or simply lexical units with different senses (Badia 2002). Specifically, Pustejovsky accounts for the event-result ambiguity in nominalizations by means of an underspecified lexical representation called dotobject, arguing that event-result nominalizations are cases of complementary polysemy: “both senses of a logically polysemous noun seem relevant for the interpretation of the noun in the context, but one sense seems ‘focused’ for purposes of a particular context” (Pustejovsky 1995, page 31).

Closely related to SRL is the task of learning Selectional Restrictions for a predicate, for example, the kind of semantic class each argument of the predicate must belong to (Mechura 2008). In this case a predefined set of semantic classes must also be used to perform the classification task. WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2006), PropBank (Palmer, Kingsbury, and Gildea 2005), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al. 2006), and OntoNotes (Hovy et al. 2006) are resources frequently used for this purpose. Most of these efforts are verb-centered and reduce role labeling to the roles played by entities around a predicate instantiated as a verb. At a finer level, there is the task of WSD, for example, assigning the most appropriate sense to each lexical unit of the text from a predefined lexical-semantic resource. Once again a catalogue of classes has to be used as a range for the assignment.1 In this case as well, despite its excessive finer granularity, WordNet is the most widely used reference.

These nominalizations were obtained semiautomatically from a 100kw subset of the AnCora-ES corpus. In this selection we took into account a predefined list of ten suffixes (-a, -aje, -i´on/-ci´on/-si´on/-´on, -da/-do, -dura/-ura, -e, -ido, -miento/-mento, -ncia/-nza, -o/-eo– [Santiago and Bustos 1999]) that contribute to an event or result meaning and which take verbs as a basis for the derivation process.

It is claimed that unergative and stative verbs give rise to result nominalizations, and unaccusative verbs usually result in ambiguous, or what we call underspecified, nominalizations. Regarding transitive verbs, they give rise to either event, result, or underspecified nominalizations. To analyze this criterion, we set out from the semantic verbal classification proposed in AnCora-Verb. In this verbal lexicon, each predicate is associated with one or more semantic classes depending on the four basic types of events (Vendler 1967) (accomplishments which correspond to transitive verbs; achievements corresponding to unaccusative verbs; states corresponding to stative verbs; and activities corresponding to unergative verbs) and on the diathesis alternations in which the verb can occur. We therefore looked up the verbal classes from which the 817 nominalizations are derived in AnCora-Verb. This allowed us to determine whether the claims about the relation between the nominalization denotation type and the corresponding verbal classes are valid.

The semantic class of the verb base of the nominalization is used as a feature in the ADN-Classifier. 5.3 AnCora-Nom This section presents AnCora-Nom,20 a Spanish lexicon of deverbal nominalizations that has been iteratively used and improved as a result of the experiments reported here. At present, it contains 1,655 lexical entries corresponding to 3,094 senses and 3,204 frames. These lexical entries represent the lemmas corresponding to the 23,431 deverbal nominalization occurrenc</context>

Finally, Scenario 10 is the same as Scenario 9 but adds an SRL process in order to obtain argument structure information. Taking into account these two sets of requirements the final version of the ADN-Classifier (R3) has been built. We used ML techniques to build the ADN-Classifier. Specifically, we used the J48.Part rule-based classifier, the rule version of the decision-tree classifier C4.5.Rules (Quinlan 1993) as implemented in the Weka toolbox (Witten and Frank 2005). We chose a rule-based classifier because it provides a natural representation of classification rules, thus allowing for the inspection of the model without diminishing accuracy and it 26 POS-tagging implies previous tokenization and sentence segmentation steps. 27 The parse tree obtained can be inspected in the same way as AnCora-ES. 850 Peris, Taul´e, and Rodriguez Empirical Methods for the Study of Denotation in Nominalizations allows us to perform a ranking of the individualized rules and a definition of a thresholding mechanism for performing a precision oriented classification.

Regarding this denotative distinction, several linguistic criteria have been proposed in order to identify each of these denotations, mostly for English, although there are some proposals for Spanish (Picallo 1999), French, Greek, Russian, and Polish (Alexiadou 2001) (see Table 2 in Section 4.1). On the other hand, authors differ on the argument-taking capacity of deverbal nominalizations: Some linguists maintain that only event deverbal nominalizations can take arguments (Zubizarreta 1987; Grimshaw 1990), whereas others consider that both event and result nominalizations can take arguments (Pustejovsky 1995; Picallo 1999; Alexiadou 2001). Authors who conceptualize event and result nominalizations as different lexical units justify this in different ways. Grimshaw (1990) considers that only complex-event nominals legitimate an argument structure, and that constitutes the main difference with respect to result nominalizations which, according to her, lack argument structure. In Alexiadou (2001) and Picallo (1999), the idea that event and result nominalizations are different lexi</context>
