<bodyText confidence="0.994995127659575">
In recent years, interest in scholarly publications in electronic forms has boomed, and several large-
scale electronic digital libraries and citation indices are now used everyday by researchers.
The fact that formal citation metrics have become an increasingly large factor in decision-making by
universities and funding bodies worldwide makes the need for research in such topics and for better
methods for measuring the impact of work more pressing.
Current digital libraries collect and allow access to digital papers and their metadata (including
citations), but largely do not attempt to analyze the items they collect.
The goal of this workshop is to investigate how developments in natural language processing and
information retrieval techniques can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding,
analysis and retrieval.
We were amazed by the number of high-quality papers we received to this inaugural workshop, and by
the innovativeness of the research that is done in this area. The contributions split into various areas,
and we will here give a quick overview of what these are.
Full document text analysis can help design information access, namely automatic summarization and
sentiment detection methods, automated recommendation and reviewing systems, and may provide
data for visualizing scientific trends and bibliometrics. Kaplan et al.’s paper studies the interaction of
citation contexts and co-reference for scientific summarization. Discourse analysis also is the focus of
Merity et al’s paper which presents an ME-based approach to Argumentative Zoning, and of S´andor
and Vorndran’s reviewing support system.
We are particularly proud to have two user studies on navigation and search at this workshop, because
better systems for information access require such studies as a starting point. Hearst and Stoica present
a user study and prototype system for faceted navigation in scholarly digital libraries, whereas the study
by Wan et al. is collecting the browsing-specific information needs by medical searchers, in particular
those that could be satisfied by citations and their contexts.
As far as improvement of academic search itself is concerned, the topic of Shi et al.’s paper is improved
anchor text extraction.
Citation analysis takes this a step further, adding scientific social network analysis as another strand of
evidence to enhance solutions to the above challenges. Web based digital libraries add download counts
and Web 2.0 information such as tagging.
This workshop contains three papers on citation support in the strictest sense, namely Hong et al., with
a fast and lightweight reference string extractor, and Romanello et al., with a recogniser for canonical
references, and also a paper on the extraction of researcher affiliation, namely Nagy et al.
Aside from researchers, this workshop hopes to interest other stakeholders, namely implementers,
publishers and policymakers. For instance, Nanba and Takezawa’s research into the Patent
Classification Support goes in this direction. Even within computer science, many different scholarly
sites exist – ACM Portal, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, PSU’s CiteSeerX, MSRA’s Libra, Tsinghua’s
iii
ArnetMiner, Trier’s DBLP, UMass’ Rexa, Hiroshima’s PRESRI – and with this workshop we hope to
bring a number of these contributers together. Radev et al.’s work on the ACL Anthology Network
Corpus reports one such invaluable resource.
Today’s publishers continue to seek new ways to be relevant to their consumers, in disseminating the
right published works to their audience. Dr. Rick Lee, who is the Director for MIS and Electronic
Publishing at the World Scientific Publishing Company, is our invited speaker and will talk about his
company’s strategy to serve content to the user in future-proof ways.
All that is left after this brief overview of the work in this workshop is to wish all participants a good
and informative day.
