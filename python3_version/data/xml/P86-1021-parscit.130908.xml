<bodyText confidence="0.999944833333333">
We propose a mapping between prosodic phenomena and
semantico-pragmatic effects based upon the hypothesis that intona-
tion conveys information about the intentional as well as the atten-
tional structure of discourse. In particular, we discuss how varia-
tions in pitch range and choice of accent and tune can help to con-
vey such information as: discourse segmentation and topic struc-
ture, appropriate choice of referent, the distinction between &apos;given&apos;
and &apos;new&apos; information, conceptual contrast or parallelism between
mentioned items, and subordination relationships between proposi-
tions salient in the discourse. Our goals for this research are prac-
tical as well as theoretical. In particular, we are investigating the
problem of intonational assignment in synthetic speech.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998151760869565">
The role of prosody in discourse has been generally ack-
nowledged but little understood. Linguistic pragmaticists have
noted that types of information status (such as given/new,
topic/comment, focus/presupposition) can be intonationally
&apos;marked&apos; [1,2,3,4], that reference resolution may depend criti-
cally on intonation [5,6], that intonation can be used to disambigu-
ate among potentially ambiguous utterances [7,8], and that
indirect speech acts may be signalled by intonational
means [9,10,11]. Conversational analysis of naturally occurring
data has found that speakers may signal topic shift, digression,
and interruption, as well as turn-taking, intonation-
ally [12,13,14]. And the fact that intonational contours contribute
in some way to utterance interpretation is itself unexception-
able [8]. To date, however, identification of the prosodic
phenomena involved -- and the proper mapping between these
phenomena and their semantico-pragmatic effects -- has been
largely intuitive, and the intonational phenomena involved have
not been precisely described.
Here, we describe how certain of the resources of the intona-
tional system are employed in discourse. In particular, we discuss
how speakers&apos; choice of pitch range, accent, and tune contribute
to the intentional and attentional structuring of discourse -- the
way speakers communicate the relationships among their discourse
goals and the relative salience of entities, attributes, and relation-
ships mentioned in the discourse.1 Our findings emerge from an
intensive study of a simple example of speech synthesis: the script
of a computer-aided instruction system, TNT (Tutor &apos;n&apos;
Trainer) [16], which employs synthetic speech to tutor computer
novices in the text editor vi. Using the Text to Speech system
(TTS) [17], we have been able, by systematic variation of pitch
1 Grosz and Sidner 1151 propose a tripartite view of discourse structure: a
linguistic structure, which is the text/speech itself; an attentlonal struc-
ture, including information about the relative salience of objects, properties,
relations, and intentions at a given point in the discourse; and an Intentional
structure, which relates discourse segment purposes (those purposes whose
recognition is essential to a segment achieving its intended effect) to one
another.
range and by a principled choice of accent and tune, to highlight
the structure of the tutorial text and thus to enhance its coherence.
While most studies of how intonation is used in discourse, have
been based solely on examination of intonational contours found in
a natural corpus, we have found that intonation synthesis provides
a unique opportunity to manipulate the dimensions of variation
orthogonally. Thus we can pinpoint factors crucial for a given
effect and evaluate various patterns for a given utterance and con-
text.

TNT was designed to teach computer-naive subjects vi, a
simple UNIX screen-oriented text editor. The tutorial portion pro-
vides a brief introduction to word processing, to general features of
vi, and to the tutor&apos;s help facilities; the tutor then guides subjects
through a series of learning tasks of graduated difficulty. While
the overall task structure is implicit in the tutorial text, the sub-
ject can influence the course of the interaction via his/her manipu-
lation of a set of &apos;helper&apos; keys; these keys provide hints (HINT) and
reminders (REMIND) as well as the option of starting a task over
again (DO OVER) or suspending the tutorial temporarily (HOLD).
The fact that TNT is explicitly task-oriented,2 makes it a
good test-bed for our purposes. An appropriate segmentation of
the text, and a notion of the purpose of each segment and the
hierarchical relationships among segments, can be independently
determined from the task at hand. Also, certain characteristics of
the text presented a particularly interesting challenge for our
study. First, the script contains little pronominal reference and
very few so-called clue words — words and phrases such as now,
next, returning to, but, and on the other hand, which can identify
discourse segment boundaries and relationships among segments,
signal interruptions and digressions, and so on [19,20]. Both of
these phenomena (together with intonation) have been identified as
important strategies for communicating discourse struc-
ture [15, 18, 19]. Their virtual absence from the text presents a
convenient opportunity for testing the power of intonation to
structure a discourse. Second, while we were not able to isolate
points in the text where subjects had special difficulties, we did
informally observe certain general problems with turn-taking3 in
the tutor -- specifically, it was not always clear when the tutor&apos;s
turn was over — which we addressed in our synthesis of the text.

The first dimension of variation, phrasing, may be indi-
cated by a pause, by a lengthening of the phrase-final syllable, and
by the occurrence of extra melodic elements on the end of the
phrase. Variation in phrasing is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.4 In
Figure 2, line 8 is produced as a single phrase, whereas in Figure 3,
And is set off as a separate phrase.
One consequence of this strategy is that And becomes more prom-
inent in the second version. Phrasing variation will not be of cen-
tral concern here. Because of the syntactic simplicity of TNT,
there were only a few cases where the phrasing could be varied in
interesting ways.

When a speaker raises his/her voice, his/her overall pitch
range -- the distance between, the highest point in the f0 contour
and the speaker&apos;s baseline (defined by the lowest point a speaker
realizes over all utterances) -- is expanded. Thus, the highest
points in the contour become higher and other aspects are propor-
tionately affected. Figure 4 shows an f0 contour for line 1 in the

The shape of the actual contour is the same as in Figure 4 but RS
scaling is different. Changes in pitch range appear to reflect the
overall structure of the discourse, with major topic shifts marked
by marked increases in pitch range.
In addition to variations in overall pitch range, the intona-
tion system exploits a local time-dependent type of pitch range
variation, called final lowering. In the experiments reported
in [24], it was found that the pitch range in declaratives is lowered
and compressed in anticipation of the end of the utterance. Final
lowering begins about half a second before the end and gradually
increases, reaching its greatest strength right at the end of the
utterance. This phenomenon appears to reflect the degree of &apos;final-
ity&apos; of an utterance; the more final lowering, the more the sense
that an utterance &apos;completes&apos; a topic is conveyed. Contrast Fig-
ures 6 and 7.

Pitch accents, which fall on the stressed syllable of lexical
items, mark those items as intonationally prominent. In line 16, for
example, right has no pitch accent. If right were to be especially
emphasized, it would have an accent. (In our notation, the absence
of a specified accent indicates that a word is not accented; where
we wish to highlight this point, we will employ `-&apos; to mark a deac-
cented word.) The contrasting outcomes are shown in Figures 8 and

In the first case, the last f0 peak occurs on work and there is a fall
to a low pitch on right, then a rise at the end of the phrase. In the
second case, the entire peak-fall-rise configuration occurs on the
word right.
There are six types of pitch accent in English [23], two sim-
ple tones -- high and low -- and four complex ones. The most fre-
quently used accent, the simple high tone, comes out as a peak on
the accented syllable (as, on right in Figure 9) and will be
represented below as H*. The &apos;H&apos; indicates a high tone, and the `4&amp;quot;
that the tone is aligned with a stressed syllable. In some cases, we
have used a L* accent, which occurs much lower in the pitch range
than H* and is phonetically realized as a local f0 minimum. The
accent on make in Figure 13 below is a L*. The other English
accents have two tones. Figure 10 shows a version of the sentence
in Figures 2 and 3 with a L-FH* accent substituted for both H*
accents in the second phrase.

accents will fall, as a speaker indicates how referents of accented or
deaccented items are related to other items in the utterance or in
some larger context.
In addition to pitch accents, each intonational phrase has a
phrase accent and a boundary tone. These two extra tones
may be either L or H. The boundary tone (indicated by `%;&apos;) falls
exactly at the phrase boundary, while the phrase accent (indicated
by an unadorned H or L) spreads over the material between the
last pitch accent and the boundary tone. Each intonational phrase
contains one or more pitch accents, a phrase accent, and a boun-
dary tone.

In our synthesis of the TNT script, we have made extensive
use of the type of accent transcribed in [23] as H*+L. This accent,
like other bitonal accents, triggers a rule which compresses the
pitch range on following material in the phrase, a phenomenon
known as downstep or catathesis. For example, a simple con-
trast between II* H* and H*+L H*+L is illustrated in Figures 11
and 12 in two versions of the tutorial command to hit the &apos;remind&apos;

The major questions underlying our research are: First,
what is the relationship between particular &apos;&amp;quot; intonational
phenomena and particular discourse phenomena?, For example,
what discourse phenomena are associated with changes in pitch
range? With the accenting or deaccenting of particular lexical
items? With choice of tune? More generally, we also characterize
the contributions of these intonational phenomena in terms of the
theory,of discourse structure developed in [15], by relating intona-
tional contributions to aspects of intentional and attentional
discourse structure. Second, how do intonational features such as
these interact with one another? Does an expansion of pitch range
affect the interpretation of a rise-fall-rise contour [25], for exam-
ple, and if so how? Third, when several discourse features predict
conflicting intonational strategies, how is a decision made? When
the information represented by a single referring expression, for
example, is both &apos;given&apos; and &apos;contrastive&apos; -- and thus both deac-
centable and accentable -- how is the choice to be made?

Students of discourse commonly observe that discourses
often exhibit a hierarchical structure -- into major topics, their
subtopics, sub-subtopics, and so on. In task-oriented domains, it
has been claimed that this structure reflects the hierarchical struc-
ture of a task and its subtasks [18]. So, for example, the TNT
introduction above might be segmented as follows (where utter-
ances are labeled by line number):5
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.922935">
Table 1. Segmenting the TNT Introduction
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979275">
This bracketing schema defines a discourse segment as any node
together with all the nodes it dominates; for example, lines 1-11
form a segment, as do lines 14-16, and so on. An alternative depic-
tion of the hierarchy above would be [{0}[1/2 3 [4 [5 6 7] [8 9 10
14] [12 [13] [14 15 16][1.6 Evidence for such hierarchical segmenta-
tion in general is found in instances of pronominal reference to
referents linearly distant in the discourse; in such cases, a notion of
hierarchical proximity appears plausible.
Previous research [12,14] has observed that &apos;topic jiamp&apos;
can be signalled by raised pitch, as well as increased amplitude and
markers of self-editing, hesitation, and discontinuity — and that
pauses and changes in rate characterize segment boundaries. In
our work with the TNT script, we found that a hierarchical seg-
mentation of discourse can be marked by systematic variation in
pitch range, which can signal movement betweeen levels in the seg-
ment hierarchy. In addition, by varying the amount of final raiding
or lowering at the end of phrases, we can indicate the degree of
conceptual continuity between one phrase and the next. We have
developed algorithms for assigning pitch range and final
raising/lowering in terms of the discourse segmentation.

5. We do not claim this is the only possible segmentation, only that it is a plausi-
ble one to convey.
6. Note that 1 and 2 are treated as a unit here, although they are synthesized as
separate phrases, since it seemed semantically correct.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933043478261">
To illustrate the algorithms, we relate the TNT introduction
presented in Figure 1 to its segmentation in Table 1. When the
introduction is synthesized using the TTS default pitch range of
75-114 Hz, the topline for each utterance will remain around 115
Hz. However, the hierarchical relationship schematized above
among the various segments may be signalled more clearly if the
pitch range is varied. In our version of the script, each segment
boundary is marked by a variation in pitch range which correlates
with the segment&apos;s position in the overall discourse. So, major
boundaries are denoted by the largest increases, with smaller
increases marking subsegment boundaries, and so on. The segment
beginning at 1, for example, is marked by raising the f0 topline to
150 Hz; that beginning at 14, by raising the topline to 136 Hz; and
that beginning at 15, by raising the topline to 125 Hz.7 Human
speakers do seem to employ a wider spectrum of pitch range varia-
tion than we have been able to use in synthesis, however.
We would claim that the appropriateness of changes in pitch
range is a function of the segmentation hierarchy -- and is not
inherent in the utterance in isolation. Our algorithm for pitch
range assignment can in fact enforce one segmentation of a given
discourse over another and, in so doing, can disambiguate among
potentially ambiguous reference resolutions. For example, It in line
7 of Figure 1 coindexes mistake, while it in line 8 coindexes word
processing. A simple linear approach to reference resolution (such
as [26] ) would have the second coindexical with the previous
noun-phrase (np), mistake, but a hierarchical approach to discourse
structure holds out the possibility that a referent in a segment
dominating the current segment may also provide a referent [18],
as, in fact, is the case here. While a little thought will make the
appropriate referent clear, it is clearer when line 8 is produced
with a larger pitch range to signal the beginning of a new subseg-
ment of the segment headed by 4. By so doing, we lessen the possi-
bility that a referent for this it will be sought in lines, 5-7. •The
most likely candidate, found in 4, is now both intonationally and
conceptually 8&apos;s superordinate discourse segment.
While an increase in the pitch range indicates segment boun-
daries, a decrease in the final lowering effects can indicate the
absence of such boundaries, and thus indicate that a given utter-
ance and one which follows it are part of the same segment. So,
manipulation of final lowering can also serve to indicate discourse
structure, by identifying the internal structure of segments. For
example, at one point in the TNT script, the following utterance
constitutes an entire discourse segment, so it has the default final
lowering (F=0.87); in consequence, the L% tone at the end of had
will be only 87% as high as it would have been if final lowering had
not applied.

<bodyText confidence="0.981660692307692">
Here, the same utterance is synthesized with less final lowering --
the L% tone at the end of had, in particular, will attain 93% of its
target height. In this segment, the first line does not end the seg-
ment. We further propose that the degree of final lowering may
correlate with the utterance&apos;s position in the discourse hierarchy.
Specifically, we suggest that minimal final lowering may indicate a
&apos;push&apos; onto the segment stack and greater degrees of final lowering
7 Our choice of ranges was determined in part by the TTS synthesizer, which
tends to sound best when its topline ranges between 115-150 Hz. Preliminary
investigation of pitch range changes in human speech indicates that, for male
speakers, these choices are reasonable. Note also that it is the relationship
among different range levels, not the actual values in Hz, which is important
here.

may be associated with &apos;pops&apos; of this stack. In our synthesis of the
TNT text, we have varied degree of final lowering for such &apos;pops&apos;
based upon the level of the segment which this utterance &apos;com-
pletes&apos; (or, equivalently, the level of the segment the next utterance
begins). So, to determine the amount of final lowering to assign
when synthesizing line 7 in the TNT introduction, we first deter-
mine whether it completes a segment (representing a pop) or not
(representing a push). If the former, we may note either that it
completes the segment begun at line 5 (with a topline of 136 Hz), or
that the subsequent segment is begun (by line 8) with a topline of
136 Hz. We assign final lowering of 0.90 when synthesizing line 7
based on either observation; this rather large amount (close to the
synthesizer&apos;s default maximum of 0,87) conveys a relatively impor-
tant change of subtopic within the larger discourse segment by
indicating rather more disjunction than we would want, for exam-
ple, between lines 9 and 10.
We are currently testing the associations between pitch
range/ final lowering variation and discourse structure proposed
above in several ways: by pitch-tracking a large corpus of natural
speech,8 by recording and analyzing subjects reading structured
texts, and by asking subjects to perform tasks such as reference
resolution from texts synthesized with varying pitch ranges.

4.2 Accent Placement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999725">
Accent placement, too, can convey information about the
structure of a discourse. Traditionally, it has been noted that
stress, or accent, can convey information about the focus of an
utterance, about given or new information in the discourse,9 about
parallelism, or about contrastiveness. In more general terms, one
might say that accent placement appears to be associated with
Grosz and Sidner&apos;s [15] attentional structure -- the salience of
discourse entities, properties, relations, and intentions at any point
in the discourse. We have particularly noted that the decision to
accent or deaccent some item is sensitive to the position of that
item in the discourse structure — that is, just as salience is always
determined relative to some particular context, accent placement
must be determined with respect to the segment in which the
accentable item appears. We take the position that it is the signal-
ing of salience relative to the discourse segment that produces the
secondary effects of given-new distinction, topic-hood or contras-
tiveness, and the favoring of one reference resolution over another.
One of the more common observations about the role of
accent placement and the structuring of discourse is that accent
can mark some item in the discourse as in focus -- i.e., as &apos;what is
being talked about&apos; [28,29] -- particularly when syntactic or
thematic information might predict otherwise. For example, in the
following instructions, erase is accented in line 2 to indicate that
the action of &apos;erasing&apos; is the focus of the current task.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.849307">
For similar reasons, we accent hello in line 1 and deaccent it in line
2.
While focus considerations clearly influence accent place-
ment, determining accent placement solely on the basis of
utterance-level focus (as proposed in Gussenhoven [29) and Culi-

9. Prince 1271 notes that the &apos;given/new&apos; distinction has been variously defined as
predictable/unpredictable, salient/not salient, shared/not shared knowledge,
and proposes a more complex taxonomy of &apos;assumed familiarity&apos; classifying
discourse entities as new, inferrable, or evoked (either textually or situation-
ally). This is closely related -- and often confused with -- the notion of utter-
ance topic/focus.

cover and Rochemont [30] ) is insufficient. Considerations such as
the given/new distinction play an important role.
Speakers typically deaccent given information and accent
new information, as when the &apos;new&apos; information typing is accented
and the &apos;old&apos; word processing is not in line 3 below:

<bodyText confidence="0.8065594375">
Note that these items are marked as &apos;given&apos; and &apos;new&apos; within the
current segment -- although they may have other status within the
larger discourse. Furthermore, items appear &apos;given&apos; or &apos;new&apos; not
simply because of prior mention (or lack thereof) in a context but
via &apos;physical co-presence&apos;, where speaker, hearer, and referents are
physically and openly present together; [31] shared world
knowledge; or conceptual proximity [1]. For example, the tutor can
treat m as given in the following text because the student has just
(incorrectly) typed mary; the character &apos;m&apos;, the student, and the
tutor, are thus physically copresent.
Oops, capital in.
H* L 11% He - L L%
The new information is that &apos;m&apos; is to be capitalized. Thus capital
is accented. Similarly, in the introduction to the tutor presented in
Figure 1, we can deaccent mistake because it is a super-concept of
the previously mentioned typo:

and it&apos;s gone.
H* L L%
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.949924333333333">
We also examine how pronominalization interacts with
accent placement. Since the ability to pronominalize is itself a
standard test of givenness, prowords, like other given items, are
commonly deaccented. If they are accented, the hearer may draw
very different conclusions from an utterance. The following utter-
ance, for example, may well convey an instruction to type the word
something or even a reprimand for not typing anything yet:
Let&apos;s begin by typing something.
H* H* He
Since the TNT script employes little pronominalization, we often
use deaccenting to `intonationally pronominalize&apos; repetitions of lex-
ical items.
Accent can also signal that a discourse referent other than
that which would be &apos;most likely&apos; without special accentuation
should be sought, as in:

tutorial system itself. Since pronouns -- as &apos;given&apos; information --
are commonly deaccented, we accent this one to indicate that an
&apos;unusual&apos; referent should be sought.th So, both accent placement
and manipulation of pitch range can be used to reorder the list of
potential referents for a given referring expression.
contrastiveness or parallelism may also be commun-
icated via accent. For example, second is accented in 3, although it
is certainly given in this segment (via mention of second draft in 1):

<listItem confidence="0.9428178">

<bodyText confidence="0.942111">

Note that, while second may be &apos;given&apos; at the discourse segment
level, the decision to accent it is based on contrast within a smaller
context, 3. Furthermore, if this function of accent is ignored, con-
trastiveness may be inferred incorrectly. If we accent we in the
last line of the tutorial introduction WE will help you out, for exam-
ple, the student would be entitled to infer that others will not be
helpful.
We are currently developing algorithms for determining
accent placement, based upon the interaction of focus, given/new,
parallelism, contrastiveness, and pronominal reference within seg-
ment and phrase.

4.3 Choice of Tune
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.884177491803279">
It is now widely accepted that the overall melody a speaker
employs in an utterance can communicate some semantic or prag-
matic information. However, since there are few particular tune
types for which we can specify with any confidence just what the
meaning might be, it is difficult to generalize about what type of
information tunes in general can convey. From those tunes whose
&apos;meaning&apos; seems fairly well understood -- namely, declarative,
yes-no question [23], surprise/redundancy 1101, contradiction
contour [33] rise-fall-rise [25], and continuation rise [34,35]
contours — we propose that tunes convey two sorts of information
about discourse.
First, we believe that contours can convey propositional
attitudesil the speaker wishes to associate with the propositional
content of an utterance. For example, the speaker may wish to
convey that s/he knows x, or that s/he believes x, or that s/he is
uncertain about x, or that s/he is ignorant of x. In the case of
H*+L sequences, it appears that a speaker may convey his/her
(propositional) attitudes about a hearer&apos;s (propositional) attitudes
toward an utterances. This tune seems to indicate the speaker&apos;s
belief that the speech act s/he is performing is superfluous. For
example, a speaker may employ it to convey that the propositional
content of his/her utterance is already known or would be obvious
to the hearer (who, of course, may or may not be attending to it).
Note that the speaker may or may not believe that this information
is known, in order to wish to convey this meaning. Particularly in
pedagogical texts, this contour seems appropriate to introduce
straightforward material, as in the following instruction to hit the
remind key.
Remind, tells you again what to do if you forget.
He L H% He He He He L L%
Hit remind.
H**L L L%
However, an H*-FL sequence is not appropriate in the following
similar exchange:
10. The standard example of accentuation influencing pronominal reference resolu-
tion in this way is&apos;john hit Bill and then HE hit HIM 132).
11. Propositional attitudes include knowing, believing, intending, uncertainty, and
ignorance.
Next, let&apos;s erase hello.
H* L 0% He He L L%
Hit hint.
He H* L L%
In general, such contours do not seem felicitous when the
utterance conveys information which the speaker believes will be
unexpected for the hearer. Here tune choice may reflect atten-
tional as well as intentional aspects of the discourse structure.
Like the deaccenting of references to given items, 11*-FL sequence
contours seem to convey `givenness&apos; at a more general level.
Second, we believe that tune can convey the speaker&apos;s com-
mitment to some semantico-pragmatic structural relationship hold-
ing between the propositional content of utterances (as, that one
&apos;completes&apos; another or is subordinate to another). Many such rela-
tions have been proposed in textual analysis [36,37,15]. In the
phonological literature, continuation rise has been commonly asso-
ciated with some sense of &apos;continuation&apos; or &apos;more to come&apos; [34]. We
have found, howe-rer, that this contour can be characterized more
precisely as conveying a subordination relationship between the
phrase uttered with continuation rise and other utterances in the
discourse segment. For example, if the second phrase of line 1 is
uttered with continuation rise, then this utterance appears to be
subordinated to 2.

<bodyText confidence="0.998443806451613">
That is, 2 &apos;completes&apos; 1. Without continuation rise on 1, all three
utterances will appear to have equal status in the-seginent. Furth-
ermore, continuation rise is not felicitous in all Contexts in which
the simple sense that &apos;there is more to come&apos; clearly should be
appropriate; for example, continuation rise over 3 -- at the end of
the tutorial introduction -- seems quite odd, even though more will
clearly follow.
In synthesizing the TNT script, we have employed only a
small subset of possible English tunes. Analysis of the &apos;meaning&apos; of
additional tunes is part of our future research. More generally, we
must examine how structural relationships conveyed by tunes such
as H*-1-L sequence are associated with those conveyed by pitch
range.
We have described certain mappings between intonational
features and discourse phenomena, associating pitch range varia-
tion with the identification of discourse segments and with their
internal coherence; accent with types of information status such as
topic (focus) and the given/new distinction, with reference resolu-
tion and with contrastiveness; and tune choice with gthe,relation-
ships among propositions in the discourse as well as -w4h,some pro-
positional attitude the speaker wishes to associate with Ithose pro-
positions. It appears that pitch range and accent placement are
most closely associated with a discourse&apos;s attentional structure,
while tune choice is more closely associated with its intentional
structure. However, clearly this picture is too simple. Several into-
national features may be used together to create some discourse
effect; moreover, in some cases two distinct intonational
phenomena seem to produce discourse effects that seem intuitively
to be closely related. And sometimes several discourse phenomena
may indicate conflicting intonational strategies. These problems
are the subject of our future research.

speakers try to convey and to synthesize speech more effectively.
We have described three major intonational phenomena -- pitch
range, accent, and tune -- and some of the information they allow
speakers to communicate about discourse, demonstrating some
links between discourse and intonational phenomena,which have
not been noted in the literature and refining some ,notions which
have. We also identify major issues which future research on the
relationship between discourse and intonation must address,
including a more precise mapping between discourse and intona-
tional phenomena, the interaction of intonational phenomena to
produce particular discourse effects, and the way conflict between
intonational strategies signaled by various aspects of the discourse
may be resolved.
We are currently testing and refining our hypotheses by 1)
pitch tracking recorded natural discourse to determine pitch range
manipulation, and 2) conducting pilot empirical studies of how
principled manipulation of pitch range can affect reference resolu-
tion. We are also examining in some detail the relationship between
pronominalization and deaccenting, pursuant to the development
of better accenting algorithms for synthetic speech. Our ultimate
goals are practical as well as theoretical. Once we have determined
how particular intonational phenomena are related to particular
discourse phenomena, the next step is to determine how these find-
ings can be applied to natural-language generation. In particular,
how much intonational structuring of generated text can be done
automatically? What sorts of information must be represented to
support the assignment of rhetorically effective intonation?

Also, certain characteristics of the text presented a particularly interesting challenge for our study. First, the script contains little pronominal reference and very few so-called clue words — words and phrases such as now, next, returning to, but, and on the other hand, which can identify discourse segment boundaries and relationships among segments, signal interruptions and digressions, and so on [19,20]. Both of these phenomena (together with intonation) have been identified as important strategies for communicating discourse structure [15, 18, 19]. Their virtual absence from the text presents a convenient opportunity for testing the power of intonation to structure a discourse. Second, while we were not able to isolate points in the text where subjects had special difficulties, we did informally observe certain general problems with turn-taking3 in the tutor -- specifically, it was not always clear when the tutor&apos;s turn was over — which we addressed in our synthesis of the text. 3.

Intonational and Discourse Phenomena The major questions underlying our research are: First, what is the relationship between particular &apos;&amp;quot; intonational phenomena and particular discourse phenomena?, For example, what discourse phenomena are associated with changes in pitch range? With the accenting or deaccenting of particular lexical items? With choice of tune? More generally, we also characterize the contributions of these intonational phenomena in terms of the theory,of discourse structure developed in [15], by relating intonational contributions to aspects of intentional and attentional discourse structure. Second, how do intonational features such as these interact with one another? Does an expansion of pitch range affect the interpretation of a rise-fall-rise contour [25], for example, and if so how? Third, when several discourse features predict conflicting intonational strategies, how is a decision made? When the information represented by a single referring expression, for example, is both &apos;given&apos; and &apos;contrastive&apos; -- and thus both deaccentable and accentable -- how is the choice to be mad</context>

Traditionally, it has been noted that stress, or accent, can convey information about the focus of an utterance, about given or new information in the discourse,9 about parallelism, or about contrastiveness. In more general terms, one might say that accent placement appears to be associated with Grosz and Sidner&apos;s [15] attentional structure -- the salience of discourse entities, properties, relations, and intentions at any point in the discourse. We have particularly noted that the decision to accent or deaccent some item is sensitive to the position of that item in the discourse structure — that is, just as salience is always determined relative to some particular context, accent placement must be determined with respect to the segment in which the accentable item appears. We take the position that it is the signaling of salience relative to the discourse segment that produces the secondary effects of give</context>

Here tune choice may reflect attentional as well as intentional aspects of the discourse structure. Like the deaccenting of references to given items, 11*-FL sequence contours seem to convey `givenness&apos; at a more general level. Second, we believe that tune can convey the speaker&apos;s commitment to some semantico-pragmatic structural relationship holding between the propositional content of utterances (as, that one &apos;completes&apos; another or is subordinate to another). Many such relations have been proposed in textual analysis [36,37,15]. In the phonological literature, continuation rise has been commonly associated with some sense of &apos;continuation&apos; or &apos;more to come&apos; [34]. We have found, howe-rer, that this contour can be characterized more precisely as conveying a subordination relationship between the phrase uttered with continuation rise and other utterances in the discourse segment. For example, if the second phrase of line 1 is uttered with continuation rise, then this utterance appears to be subordinated to 2. 1. We can&apos;t answer questions, if you are confused.

When the information represented by a single referring expression, for example, is both &apos;given&apos; and &apos;contrastive&apos; -- and thus both deaccentable and accentable -- how is the choice to be made? 4.1 Pitch Range Manipulation Students of discourse commonly observe that discourses often exhibit a hierarchical structure -- into major topics, their subtopics, sub-subtopics, and so on. In task-oriented domains, it has been claimed that this structure reflects the hierarchical structure of a task and its subtasks [18]. So, for example, the TNT introduction above might be segmented as follows (where utterances are labeled by line number):5 Table 1. Segmenting the TNT Introduction This bracketing schema defines a discourse segment as any node together with all the nodes it dominates; for example, lines 1-11 form a segment, as do lines 14-16, and so on. An alternative depiction of the hierarchy above would be [{0}[1/2 3 [4 [5 6 7] [8 9 10 14] [12 [13] [14 15 16][1.6 Evidence for such hierarchical segmentation in general is found in instances of pronominal reference to referents linearly distant in the discour</context>

A simple linear approach to reference resolution (such as [26] ) would have the second coindexical with the previous noun-phrase (np), mistake, but a hierarchical approach to discourse structure holds out the possibility that a referent in a segment dominating the current segment may also provide a referent [18], as, in fact, is the case here. While a little thought will make the appropriate referent clear, it is clearer when line 8 is produced with a larger pitch range to signal the beginning of a new subsegment of the segment headed by 4. By so doing, we lessen the possibility that a referent for this it will be sought in lines, 5-7. •The most likely candidate, found in 4, is now both intonationally and conceptually 8&apos;s superordinate discourse segment.

The &apos;H&apos; indicates a high tone, and the `4&amp;quot; that the tone is aligned with a stressed syllable.

This accent, like other bitonal accents, triggers a rule which compresses the pitch range on following material in the phrase, a phenomenon known as downstep or catathesis.

Actual Pitch Range The shape of the actual contour is the same as in Figure 4 but RS scaling is different. Changes in pitch range appear to reflect the overall structure of the discourse, with major topic shifts marked by marked increases in pitch range. In addition to variations in overall pitch range, the intonation system exploits a local time-dependent type of pitch range variation, called final lowering. In the experiments reported in [24], it was found that the pitch range in declaratives is lowered and compressed in anticipation of the end of the utterance. Final lowering begins about half a second before the end and gradually increases, reaching its greatest strength right at the end of the utterance. This phenomenon appears to reflect the degree of &apos;finality&apos; of an utterance; the more final lowering, the more the sense that an utterance &apos;completes&apos; a topic is conveyed.
