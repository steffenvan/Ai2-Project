Workshops on Semantics And Representation
of Knowledge Being Held in New York
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805">
Semantics of natural language and methods for
representing knowledge are the topics of a series of
informal workshops held at the IBM Systems Research
Institute in New York City. The workshops are open
to anyone who is actively doing research on these top-
ics in the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psy-
chology, computational linguistics, data base design,
linguistics, philosophy, psycholinguistics, and symbolic
logic. The purpose of the workshops is to provide a
forum for people who are working on these and related
topics at universities and research institutions in New
York and surrounding areas. Visitors from other loca-
tions are welcome to come, but we would like to es-
tablish a nucleus of participants who can attend regu-
larly.
The format for the workshops is a meeting about
once a month, normally on Friday mornings. The first
meeting is scheduled for February 1, 1980 with a lec-
ture, &amp;quot;Inferring Conceptual Meaning Structures,&amp;quot; by
Professor Sharon Salveter from SUNY at Stony Brook.
The IBM Systems Research Institute is providing a
classroom and maintaining a computerized mailing list
for the workshops. Anyone who is interested in at-
tending and/or speaking at the workshops should send
name, address, and a description of research interests

Natural Language questions differ from most exist-
ing formal query languages in that they tend to admit a
wider range of responses than their formal counter-
parts, and provide cues for selecting among the variety
of appropriate responses. These differences reflect the
fact that in Natural Language conversation, a respon-
dent is expected to take an active role in the process
of selecting and organizing responses, in contrast to
formal query systems, where control of the interaction
typically resides with the user or applications program-
mer. This paper explores some specific ways in which
Natural Language questions are particularly well suited
for their environment, and discusses the potential role
of similar capabilities in formal query systems, particu-
larly with respect to Natural Language Data Base
query systems.

A Question-Answering System (QAS) is impertinent
if it tells a user something the user did not ask! Since
a user rarely understands the full implications of a data
base, especially a large one, his question is limited by
his knowledge of the data base. Sometimes, a question
similar to the one he originally asked could better sat-
isfy his goals, but he did not ask it because he had no
reason to do so. Hence, impertinence is a necessary
feature of sophisticated QAS.
We describe a complete theory for impertinent
QAS. The QAS is impertinent when, and only when, a
small change in the question results in a large positive
change in the answer, i.e., in the presence of a discon-
tinuity. (The metrics are user dependent.) In imperti-
nent QAS, the user&apos;s: &amp;quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell me?&amp;quot; an-
swered by &amp;quot;BUT YOU DIDN&apos;T ASK,&amp;quot; no longer oc-
cur. The theory has been implemented in a sophisti-
cated airline tariff system.

Problems and possibilities for near term natural
language query systems are discussed, with emphasis
on the author&apos;s own system, EQS. First, the general
objectives for near term systems in the areas of syntax,
world knowledge, discourse, and problem solving are
considered. Next, a comparison is made between the
ATN parsing strategies in LADDER, ROBOT,
PLANES, and EQS. Evidence for the importance of
giving answers to queries not directly available in the
data base is given together with some speculation on
how the knowledge necessary for this might be ac-
quired. After some general discussion of semantic
data models, the semantic data model used in EQS is
described, and the method used for building a semantic
data model of an existing CODASYL data base is
sketched. Lastly, the use of multiple levels of repre-
sentation as a way to control complexity of such query
systems is discussed.

In the early 1970&apos;s the natural language processing
techniques developed within the field of artificial intel-
ligence (AI) made important progress. Within certain
restricted micro worlds of discourse it became possible
to process a reasonable large class of English. These
techniques have now been applied to the real micro
world of data base query, allowing for information to
be extracted from data bases by asking ordinary Eng-
lish questions. This paper discusses the importance or
true natural language data base query and describes
the ROBOT system, a high performance production
level system already installed in several real world
environments. The specific data structure require-
ments of the ROBOT system are discussed, as well as
an extended type of data inversion that provides pre-
cisely the functionality required by the natural lan-

By typing requests in English, casual users will be
able to obtain explicit answers from a large relational
database of aircraft flight and maintenance data using
a system called PLANES. The design and implemen-
tation of this system is described and illustrated with
detailed examples of the operation of system compo-
nents and examples of overall system operation. The
language processing portion of the system uses a num-
ber of augmented transition networks, each of which
matches phrases with a specific meaning, along with
context registers (history keepers) and concept case
frames; these are used for judging meaningfulness of
questions, generating dialogue for clarifying partially
understood questions, and resolving ellipsis and pro-
noun reference problems. Other system components
construct a formal query for the relational database,
and optimize the order of searching relations. Me-
thods are discussed for handling vague or complex
questions and for providing browsing ability. Also
included are discussions of important issues in pro-
gramming natural language systems for limited do-

overall system architecture is presented showing how a
user is buffered from the actual database management
systems (DBMS&apos;s) by three layers of insulating compo-

insulating components, the natural language system. A
pragmatic approach to language access that has proved
useful for building interfaces to databases is described
and illustrated by examples. Special language features
that increase system usability, such as spelling correc-

This paper discusses some of the linguistic problems
encountered during the development of the User Spe-
cialty Languages (USL) system, an information system
that accepts a subset of German or English as input
for query, analysis, and updating of data. The system
is regarded as a model for portions of natural language
that are relevant to interactions with a data base. The
model provides insight into the functioning of language
and the linguistic behavior of users who must commu-
nicate with a machine in order to obtain information.
The aim of application independence made it necessary
to approach many problems from a different angle
than in most comparable systems. Rather than a full
treatment of the linguistic capacity of the system, de-
tails of phenomena such as time handling, coordina-
tion, quantification, and possessive pronouns are pres-
ented. The solutions that have been implemented are
described, and open questions are pointed out.

patients satisfying certain characteristics, that perform
simple calculations, that allow browsing through the
data base, and that assist in identifying relations
among attributes. The system supports dialogue inter-

This report summarizes recent work on the relation
of language to information structure, and on computer
programs which convert the information in natural
language documents in a given subject area into a
structured data base. Operating on this data base,
subsequent computer programs can retrieve specific
facts and summarize the different types of information
present in the original documents. The technique is
based upon the prior development of a natural lan-
guage parsing system equipped with a comprehensive
grammar of English. To this have been added proce-
dures which reduce paraphrastically the variety of syn-
tactic forms found in sentences and align parts of dif-
ferent sentences which have similar grammatical and
informational standing in their respective sentences.
When these procedures are applied to documents in
the same subject area, the result is a table-like struc-
ture, called an information format, which contains the
same information as the original documents, but ar-
ranged in a structured, rather than narrative, form.

This paper describes a system for automatically
answering questions about a collection of natural lan-
guage medical records. The particular records used for
an initial experiment were a set of 206 radiology re-
ports. The implementation involves two major steps:
manual determination of a suitable tabular structure
(information format) for representing the information
contained in the medical records, and automatic con-
version of the natural language input (for either record
or question) into a form corresponding to the data
base. For the medical records the conversion into a
data base is done by first performing a syntactic and
transformational analysis of the sentences, followed by
application of formatting transformations. The
question-answering procedure has analogous initial
steps but undergoes additional steps of processing to
translate the question into a retrieval operation on the
data base. Samples of the data base and of the
question-answering procedure are shown.

The augmented transition network formalism is a
special purpose programming language for organizing
decisions during the analysis of an English sentence,
which has been extensively used in syntactically based
natural language programs for the past ten years.
There have been a few suggestions recently that this
formalism could be used for semantically based pro-
grams. It seems unlikely that this proposal will be
viable, since semantic categories are not the appropri-

This paper presents some preliminary and still quite
rudimentary ideas growing out of on-going studies into
the problem of representation of quantified informa-
tion in English, in terms of linked and nested
&amp;quot;attribute-value&amp;quot; structures. Specifically, we indicate
how such representation can be accomplished within
the kind of attribute-value framework provided by
Heidorn&apos;s NLP (Natural Language Processor) system.
A scheme for representing well-formed formulas of
a sorted first-order logic (with descriptions) is first
presented and serves as a bare conceptual framework
for understanding the sequel. Then we indicate how
certain commonly encountered English language quan-
tificational utterances may be reduced to canonical
forms representable within such an underlying scheme.
A few of many still outstanding logico-linguistic issues
(viz.: ambiguities connected with &apos;a&apos;, &apos;any&apos; and

The nature of names and their creation and use in
naming is reviewed in the literature of three disci-
plines: philosophy, linguistics, and psychology. Con-
vergent themes in this vast and yet inadequate litera-
ture suggest that a technical program of behavioral
research may be feasible and productive in this area at
the present time.

Reference is a central issue for language compre-
hension and generation. After reviewing existing proc-
ess models for comprehending and generating referring
expressions, we present a general framework for con-
text and reference processing. The context for refer-
ence processing is represented as a &amp;quot;Public Works-
pace.&amp;quot; Reference processes access Public Workspace
and modify its content, which is the set of concepts
currentl\ &amp;quot;on the table&amp;quot; as far as the current language
interaction is concerned. Information from many dif-
ferent sources can be integrated in comprehending or
generating referring expressions. Within this general
framework, a new system for selectively generating
referring phrases is developed. This system decides
how much to express about a given concept in a given
context.

An approach for the automatic error detection in
natural language words without the use of a dictionary
of permissible words is described. Automatically gen-
erated tables which describe permissible syllables and
syllable sequences are used instead. These, on the
other hand, are based on permissible initial and termi-
nal consonant and vowel clusters. Therefore, an arbi-
trary string or erroneous word is tested whether it
resembles a natural language word applying the above
sequence tables. It is shown that under certain as-
sumptions the error detection rate is approximately
80 by using relatively small tables with 70k bytes.
The described principle may be applied recursively in
order to obtain higher detection rates.

This paper discusses two methods of text analysis
used in research on children&apos;s understanding of stories,
one based on story &amp;quot;grammars&amp;quot; and one on analysis of
characters&apos; plans. Using either one comes to similar
basic conclusions. First, real stories have structures
that can be identified and studied. Since it is a diffi-
cult task to recognize and use these structures in read-
ing, children who have limited experience with real
stories draw upon the reader&apos;s prior beliefs and expec-
tations. The structure or connectivity of a story pro-
vides a framework for organizing appropriate prior
beliefs. Third, the inherent complexity of story under-
standing, particularly the need to use prior beliefs in
appropriate ways, means that there are usually several
&amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; but different ways of understanding the
same story. This suggests that children and adults my
understand the same story in very different ways.

A major goal of this work is to specify some steps
of the process by which participants maintain coheren-
cy in their conversations. The underlying element of
the analysis is a construct called a &apos;context space&apos;.
Roughly, a group of utterances that refers to a single
issue or episode forms the basis for a context space.
Superficially, a conversation is a sequence of utteranc-
es; at a deeper level it is a structured entity whose
utterances can be parsed into hierarchically related
context spaces.
As a conversation proceeds, each conversant is
building up a model of the conversation. Such a model
includes the conversation&apos;s context space structure, a
notion of the present discourse topic, and a list ot
items being focused upon. An important factor upon
which the smoothness and coherency of a conversation
depends is the lack of conflict between the respective
models of the participants. Conflicts are prevented by
a speaker following a number of high level syntactic
and semantic relational rules that enable listeners to
identify the speaker&apos;s discourse model. These rules are
given in the paper, and, as the reader shall see, they

A theory of speech acts is developed that treats
speech acts as operators in a planning system. The
speech acts of requesting and informing are formally
defined, and plans containing those speech acts are
presented. Unlike previous (informal) speech act the-
ories, this paper supplies justifications for the form and
&apos; content of its speech act definitions. The adequacy
criterion proposed here is that given an initial set of
beliefs and goals, the speech act definitions should
allow for the generation of plans for those speech acts
that a person could issue appropriately under the same
circumstances. This adequacy criterion is used in judg-
ing whether speech act definitions pass certain tests, in
particular, the test of compositionality. For instance,
since a speaker can request that a hearer do some arbi-
trary action, a speaker ought to be able to request that
a hearer perform a speech act. A number of previous
formulations of requesting and informing are shown to
fail this test as applied to the planning of questions
and to multi-party requests, such as &amp;quot;Ask Tom to open
the door&amp;quot;. In order to plan questions (requests to in-
form), two variations of informing speech acts are
defined -- informing about the referent of a descrip-
tion and informing whether some proposition is true,
which lead to WH and yes-no questions, respectively.
It is argued that meta-theoretical principles should be
developed that state how to formulate speech act defi-
nitions to pass the adequacy tests. One such principle
is proposed and is shown to allow for the planning of
multi-party requests.

The recent report for the Commission of the Euro-
pean Communities on current multilingual activities in
the field of scientific and technical information and the
1977 conference on the same theme both included
substantial sections on operational and experimental
machine translation systems, and in its Plan of Action
the Commission announced its intention to introduce
an operational machine translation system into its de-
partments and to support research projects on machine
translation. This revival of interest in machine transla-
tion may well have surprised many who have tended in
recent years to dismiss it as one of the &amp;quot;great failures&amp;quot;
of scientific research. What has changed? What
grounds are there now for optimism about machine
translation? Or is it still a &amp;quot;utopian dream&amp;quot;? The aim
of this review is to give a general picture of present
activities which may help readers to reach their own
conclusions. After a sketch of the historical back-
ground and general aims (Section I), it describes oper-
ational and experimental machine translation systems
of recent years (Section II), it continues with descrip-
tions of interactive (man-machine) systems and

This paper considers the possibilities for knowledge-
based automatic text translation in light of recent ad-
vances in Artificial Intelligence. It is argued that com-
petent translation requires some reasonable depth of
understanding of the source text, and in particular,
access to detailed contextual information. The follow-
ing Machine Translation paradigm is proposed: First,
the source text is analyzed and mapped into a
language-free conceptual representation. Then, infer-
ence mechanisms apply contextual world knowledge to
augment the representation by adding all information
that was implicit in the input text. Finally, a natural-
language generator maps the most relevant sections of
the language-free representation into the target lan-
guage. We illustrate this process with examples of
English-to-Spanish and English-to-Russian transla-
tions, including some produced by SAM, a working
system of computer programs at Yale University.

The CYRUS system is a natural language data-base
query system containing biographical information
about Cyrus Vance, Secretary of State of the United
States. It also contains additional information associ-
ated with Vance that may be needed in order to an-
swer questions about him, such as current events and
limited biographical information about people he has
been in close contact with. Questions input in English
are answered by accessing conceptual structures con-
taining this information.
This paper addresses the problems of knowledge
organization and retrieval of information in the data-
base. The conceptual structures used to represent,
organize, and retrieve information are described, as
well as the procedures used to answer natural language
questions. Specific event information about the per-
sons represented in the data-base must be stored; so
must world events, general world knowledge, and rules
about inference and reference resolution. The first
half of the paper describes and explains some of the
structures used for organizing this knowledge; the
second half shows how CYRUS makes use of these
structures.

During a summer workshop (funded by the Sloan
Foundation) that we ran at Yale, I tried to present
some of the views that we hold with respect to the
problems of representation of meaning, the making of
inferences, and the function of higher level descrip-
tions of the structure of knowledge, to an audience
primarily consisting of social and cognitive psycholo-
gists. Most of the participants in the workshop were
interested in our ideas on this subject. However, their
background really had not prepared them to under-
stand why we did what we did or how we came to do
it. Consequently, I attempted to give them that back-
ground by retracing the steps in our research of the
last ten years. I explained how we came to hold our
current views on various subjects by showing what our
initial assumptions were and how one position natural-

the workshop felt that these lectures provided the con-

This thesis describes a computer story understander
which applies knowledge of the world to comprehend
what it reads. The system, called SAM, reads newspa-
per articles from a variety of domains, then demon-
strates its understanding by summarizing or paraphras-
ing the text, or answering questions about it. Since
the knowledge structures SAM works with are concep-
tual and language-free, we have been able to add a
limited machine-translation capability to SAM, as well.
SAM&apos;s knowledge of the world is encoded through
the use of a representational construct called a Script.
Scripts describe the stereotyped activities characteristic
of socially ritualized situations such as going to stores,
museums and restaurants, taking business trips and
vacations, and attending banquets and birthday parties.
SAM consults its Scripts to recognize the events a
particular text refers to, to identify the participants in
these events, and to fill in other events, not explicitly
mentioned by a story, which can be plausibly inferred
to have happened. In this process, it moves Scripts in
and out of active memory on the basis of predictions it
makes about what may be seen next.
Sam represents an attempt to build a complete,
working story understander exploring an important
source of knowledge about the world to find the con-
nections which make a text &amp;quot;coherent,&amp;quot; and to build a
memory representation for the text from which
natural-language outputs can be generated which indi-
cate a reasonable depth of understanding. Since

derstand what they read, SAM embodies a theory of

Stories usually describe situations involving pur-
poseful interactions between people. To understand
stories, a reader needs a large body of knowledge
about the kinds of situations that may occur, and must
be able to use this knowledge to infer implicit aspects
of a situation described by a text. Building a computer
program that understands stories therefore requires an
explicit description of this knowledge, and the con-
struction of an inference mechanism with which to
apply it.
This thesis is about understanding story situations
involving goals. Most of the thesis is concerned with
describing the categories of story situations that goals
arise in, and with giving algorithms for detecting and
processing the situations in each category. The most
interesting categories of story situations involve multi-
ple goals. Understanding a situation with a number of
goals in it requires a reader to determine the interrela-
tionships between those goals, and to infer the conse-
quences of these relationships. Goal relationships
form the basis for most of the situational categories
presented here.
Knowledge of story situations and how they can be
processed was used to build a story understanding
program called PAM (Plan Applier Mechanism). PAM
reads stories in English, and produces story representa-
tions that include the inferences needed to connect
each story&apos;s events. To demonstrate that it has under-
stood a story, PAM answers questions about the story
and expresses the story from several points of view.

Modeling human understanding of natural language
requires a model of the processes underlying human
thought. No two people think exactly alike; different
people subscribe to different beliefs and are motivated
by different goals in their activities. A theory of sub-
jective understanding has been proposed to account
for subjectively-motivated human thinking ranging
from ideological belief to human discourse and person-
ality traits. A process-model embodying this theory
has been implemented in a computer system, POLITI-
CS. POLITICS demonstrates its understanding by
answering questions in natural language question-
answer dialogs.
POLITICS represents political ideologies as goal
trees that structure the motivations of political actors
and the relative importance of the various motivations.
General purpose counterplanning strategies and more
specific situational inference rules model the reasoning
processes. Counterplanning strategies determine
when, how and why political actors attempt various
plans to thwart each other&apos;s goals, nullify each other&apos;s
thwarting attempt, or end mutual hostilities. The sub-
jective goal trees determine the focus of attention for
the reasoning process. Only inferences that are rele-
vant to the interests, goals and beliefs of the under-
stander are pursued. This process drastically reduces
the inference search space.
In addition to POLITICS, the theory of subjective
understanding has been embodied in other process-
models, also implemented as computer programs.
These programs are TRIAD, a system that models
human understanding of social conflict situations, and
MICS, a system that models a participant in a natural
language conversation. TRIAD generalizes the ideo-
logical conflict understanding of POLITICS to encom-
pass all types of situations, ranging from domestic
quarrels to judicial decisions and international disa-
greements. MICS uses goal trees to represent the
conversational motivations of a person, and thus
guides the course of the conversation towards the top-
ics it is interested in discussing. All three systems
presented in this dissertation are integrated under-
standing systems, incorporating subjective beliefs, rea-
soning strategies, and natural language analysis into a
single, unified process.

Natural Language questions differ from most existing formal query languages in that they tend to admit a wider range of responses than their formal counterparts, and provide cues for selecting among the variety of appropriate responses. These differences reflect the fact that in Natural Language conversation, a respondent is expected to take an active role in the process of selecting and organizing responses, in contrast to formal query systems, where control of the interaction typically resides with the user or applications programmer. This paper explores some specific ways in which Natural Language questions are particularly well suited for their environment, and discusses the potential role of similar capabilities in formal query systems, particularly with respect to Natural Language Data Base query systems. * Editor&apos;s note: The abstracts in this first issue are not as &amp;quot;current&amp;quot; as I would like, but, because we did not publish the 1979, there is a lot of material to get caught up on.</abstract>

Since a user rarely understands the full implications of a data base, especially a large one, his question is limited by his knowledge of the data base. Sometimes, a question similar to the one he originally asked could better satisfy his goals, but he did not ask it because he had no to do so. Hence, impertinence is a feature of sophisticated QAS. We describe a complete theory for impertinent QAS. The QAS is impertinent when, and only when, a small change in the question results in a large positive change in the answer, i.e., in the presence of a discontinuity. (The metrics are user dependent.) In impertinent QAS, the user&apos;s: &amp;quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell me?&amp;quot; anby &amp;quot;BUT YOU DIDN&apos;T ASK,&amp;quot; no longer occur.

<abstract confidence="0.967010210526316">1978 Annual Conf., Dec. 1978, 156-164. Problems and possibilities for near term natural language query systems are discussed, with emphasis on the author&apos;s own system, EQS. First, the general objectives for near term systems in the areas of syntax, world knowledge, discourse, and problem solving are considered. Next, a comparison is made between the ATN parsing strategies in LADDER, ROBOT, PLANES, and EQS. Evidence for the importance of giving answers to queries not directly available in the data base is given together with some speculation on how the knowledge necessary for this might be acquired. After some general discussion of semantic data models, the semantic data model used in EQS is described, and the method used for building a semantic data model of an existing CODASYL data base is sketched. Lastly, the use of multiple levels of representation as a way to control complexity of such query systems is discussed.</abstract>

In the early 1970&apos;s the natural language processing techniques developed within the field of artificial intelligence (AI) made important progress. Within certain restricted micro worlds of discourse it became possible to process a reasonable large class of English. These techniques have now been applied to the real micro world of data base query, allowing for information to be extracted from data bases by asking ordinary English questions. This paper discusses the importance or true natural language data base query and describes the ROBOT system, a high performance production level system already installed in several real world environments. The specific data structure requirements of the ROBOT system are discussed, as well as an extended type of data inversion that provides precisely the functionality required by the natural language parser.</abstract>

By typing requests in English, casual users will be able to obtain explicit answers from a large relational database of aircraft flight and maintenance data using a system called PLANES. The design and implementation of this system is described and illustrated with detailed examples of the operation of system components and examples of overall system operation. The language processing portion of the system uses a number of augmented transition networks, each of which matches phrases with a specific meaning, along with registers keepers) and case are used for judging meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for clarifying partially understood questions, and resolving ellipsis and pronoun reference problems. Other system components construct a formal query for the relational database, and optimize the order of searching relations. Methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions and for providing browsing ability. Also included are discussions of important issues in programming natural language systems for limited domains, and the relationship of this system to others.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.981880263157895">Aspects of an intelligent interface that provides natural language access to a large body of data distributed over a computer network are described. The overall system architecture is presented showing how a user is buffered from the actual database management systems (DBMS&apos;s) by three layers of insulating components. These layers operate in series to convert natural language queries into calls to DBMS&apos;s at remote sites. Attention is then focused on the first of the insulating components, the natural language system. A pragmatic approach to language access that has proved useful for building interfaces to databases is described and illustrated by examples. Special language features that increase system usability, such as spelling correcof incomplete inputs, and system personalization, are also discussed. The language system is contrasted with other work in applied natural language processing, and the system&apos;s limitations are analyzed.</abstract>

This paper discusses some of the linguistic problems encountered during the development of the User Specialty Languages (USL) system, an information system that accepts a subset of German or English as input for query, analysis, and updating of data. The system is regarded as a model for portions of natural language that are relevant to interactions with a data base. The model provides insight into the functioning of language and the linguistic behavior of users who must communicate with a machine in order to obtain information. The aim of application independence made it necessary to approach many problems from a different angle than in most comparable systems. Rather than a full treatment of the linguistic capacity of the system, details of phenomena such as time handling, coordination, quantification, and possessive pronouns are presented. The solutions that have been implemented are described, and open questions are pointed out. The Meaning of &amp;quot;Of&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Have&amp;quot; in the USL-System</abstract>

This paper describes ongoing research towards developing a system that will allow physicians personal access to patient medical data through natural language queries to support both patient management and clinical research. A prototype system has been implemented for a small data base on malignant melanoma. The physician can input queries in English that retrieve specified data for particular patients or for groups of patients satisfying certain characteristics, that perform simple calculations, that allow browsing through the data base, and that assist in identifying relations among attributes. The system supports dialogue interactions; that is, the user can follow aline of inquiry to test a particular hypothesis by entering a sequence of queries that depend on each other. Classes of questions that can be processed are described and examples using the system are given.</abstract>

Operating on this data base, subsequent computer programs can retrieve specific facts and summarize the different types of information present in the original documents. The technique is based upon the prior development of a natural language parsing system equipped with a comprehensive grammar of English. To this have been added procedures which reduce paraphrastically the variety of syntactic forms found in sentences and align parts of different sentences which have similar grammatical and informational standing in their respective sentences. When these procedures are applied to documents in the same subject area, the result is a table-like structure, called an information format, which contains the same information as the original documents, but arranged in a structured, rather than narrative, form.</abstract>

The particular records used for an initial experiment were a set of 206 radiology reports. The implementation involves two major steps: manual determination of a suitable tabular structure format) representing the information contained in the medical records, and automatic conversion of the natural language input (for either record or question) into a form corresponding to the data base. For the medical records the conversion into a data base is done by first performing a syntactic and transformational analysis of the sentences, followed by of transformations. question-answering procedure has analogous initial steps but undergoes additional steps of processing to translate the question into a retrieval operation on the data base. Samples of the data base and of the question-answering procedure are shown.</abstract>
