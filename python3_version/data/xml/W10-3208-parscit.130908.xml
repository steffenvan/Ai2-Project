The discipline where sentiment/ opi-
nion/ emotion has been identified and
classified in human written text is well
known as sentiment analysis. A typical
computational approach to sentiment
analysis starts with prior polarity lex-
icons where entries are tagged with
their prior out of context polarity as
human beings perceive using their
cognitive knowledge. Till date, all re-
search efforts found in sentiment lex-
icon literature deal mostly with English
texts. In this article, we propose mul-
tiple computational techniques like,
WordNet based, dictionary based, cor-
pus based or generative approaches for
generating SentiWordNet(s) for Indian
languages. Currently, SentiWordNet(s)
are being developed for three Indian
languages: Bengali, Hindi and Telugu.
An online intuitive game has been de-
veloped to create and validate the de-
veloped SentiWordNet(s) by involving
Internet population. A number of au-
tomatic, semi-automatic and manual
validations and evaluation methodolo-
gies have been adopted to measure the
coverage and credibility of the devel-
oped SentiWordNet(s).

<bodyText confidence="0.999963022222222">
Sentiment analysis and classification from
electronic text is a hard semantic disambigua-
tion problem. The regulating aspects of seman-
tic orientation of a text are natural language
context information (Pang et al., 2002) lan-
guage properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006),
domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Ga-
mon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the
time dimension (Read, 2005).
The following example shows that the polar-
ity tag associated with a sentiment word de-
pends on the time dimension. During 90’s mo-
bile phone users generally reported in various
online reviews about their color phones but in
recent times color phone is not just enough.
People are fascinated and influenced by touch
screen and various software(s) installation fa-
cilities on these new generation gadgets.
In typical computational approaches (Higa-
shinaka et al., 2007; Hatzivassiloglou et al.,
2000) to sentiment analysis researchers con-
sider the problem of learning a dictionary that
maps semantic representations to verbaliza-
tions, where the data comes from opinionated
electronic text. Although lexicons in these dic-
tionaries are not explicitly marked up with re-
spect to their contextual semantics, they con-
tain only explicit polarity rating and aspect
indicators. Lexicon-based approaches can be
broadly classified into two categories firstly
where the discriminative polarity tag of lex-
icons is determined on labeled training data
and secondly where the lexicons are manually
compiled, the later constitutes the main effec-
tive approach.
It is undoubted that the manual compilation
is always the best way to create monolingual
semantic lexicons, but manual methods are
expensive in terms of human resources, it in-
volves a substantial number of human annota-
tors and it takes lot of time as well. In this pa-
per we propose several computational tech-
niques to generate sentiment lexicons in Indian
languages automatically and semi-
automatically. In the present task, SentiWord-

Beijing, China, 21-22 August 2010. c�2010 Asian Federation for Natural Language Processing
Net(s) are being developed for the Bengali,
Hindi and Telugu languages.
Several prior polarity sentiment lexicons are
available for English such as SentiWordNet
(Esuli et. al., 2006), Subjectivity Word List
(Wilson et. al., 2005), WordNet Affect list
(Strapparava et al., 2004), Taboada’s adjective
list (Taboada et al., 2006).

<bodyText confidence="0.999906425">
Among these publicly available sentiment
lexicon resources we find that SentiWordNet is
most widely used (number of citation is higher
than other resources1) in several applications
such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and
emotion analysis. Subjectivity Word List is
most trustable as the opinion mining system
OpinionFinder2 that uses the subjectivity word
list has reported highest score for opi-
nion/sentiment subjectivity (Wiebe and Riloff,
2006). SentiWordNet is an automatically con-
structed lexical resource for English that as-
signs a positivity score and a negativity score
to each WordNet synset.
The subjectivity word list is compiled from
manually developed resources augmented with
entries learned from corpora. The entries in the
subjectivity word list have been labeled with
part of speech (POS) tags as well as either
strong or weak subjective tag depending on the
reliability of the subjective nature of the entry.
These two resources have been merged au-
tomatically and the merged resource is used for
SentiWordNet(s) generation in the present
task.
The generated sentiment lexicons or Senti-
WordNet(s) for several Indian languages most-
ly contain synsets (approximately 60%) of re-
spective languages. Synset based method is
robust for any kind of monolingual lexicon
creation and useful to avoid further word sense
disambiguation problem in application domain.
Additionally we have developed an online
intuitive game to create and validate the devel-
oped SentiWordNet(s) by involving Internet
population.
The proposed approaches in this paper are
easy to adopt for any new language. To meas-
ure the coverage and credibility of generated
SentiWordNet(s) in Indian languages we have

Various methods have been used in the litera-
ture such as WordNet based, dictionary based,
corpus based or generative approaches for sen-
timent lexicon generation in a new target lan-
guage.
Andreevskaia and Bergler, (2006) present a
method for extracting sentiment-bearing adjec-
tives from WordNet using the Sentiment Tag
Extraction Program (STEP). They did 58
STEP runs on unique non-intersecting seed
lists drawn from manually annotated list of
positive and negative adjectives and evaluated
the results against other manually annotated
lists.
The proposed methods in (Wiebe and Riloff,
2006) automatically generate resources for
subjectivity analysis for a new target language
from the available resources for English. Two
techniques have been proposed for the genera-
tion of target language lexicon from English
subjectivity lexicon. The first technique uses a
bilingual dictionary while the second method
is a parallel corpus based approach using exist-
ing subjectivity analysis tools for English.
Automatically or manually created lexicons
may have limited coverage and do not include
most semantically contrasting word pairs like
antonyms. Antonyms are broadly categorized
(Saif Mohammed, 2008) as gradable adjec-
tives (hot–cold, good–bad, friend–enemy) and
productive adjectives (normal–abnormal, for-
tune–misfortune, implicit–explicit). The first
type contains the semantically contrasting
word pairs but the second type includes ortho-
graphic suffix/affix as a clue. The second type
is highly productive using very less number of
affixation rules.
Degree of antonymy (Mohammad et al.,
2008) is defined to encompass the complete
semantic range as a combined measure of the
contrast in meaning conveyed by two antony-
my words and is identified by distributional
hypothesis. It helps to measure relative senti-
ment score of a word and its antonym.
Kumaran et al., (2008) introduced a beauti-
ful method for automatic data creation by on-
line intuitive games. A methodology has been
</bodyText>

proposed for community creation of linguistic
data by community collaborative framework
known as wikiBABEL3. It may be described as
a revolutionary approach to automatically
create large credible linguistic data by involv-
ing Internet population for content creation.
For the present task we prefer to involve all
the available methodologies to automatically
and semi-automatically create and validate
SentiWordNet(s) for three Indian languages.
Automatic methods involve only computation-
al methods. Semi-automatic methods involve
human interruption to validate system’s output.

SentiWordNet and Subjectivity Word List
have been identified as the most reliable source
lexicons. The first one is widely used and the
second one is robust in terms of performance.
A merged sentiment lexicon has been devel-
oped from both the resources by removing the
duplicates. It has been observed that 64% of
the single word entries are common in the Sub-
jectivity Word List and SentiWordNet. The
new merged sentiment lexicon consists of
14,135 numbers of tokens. Several filtering
techniques have been applied to generate the
new list.
A subset of 8,427 sentiment words has been
extracted from the English SentiWordNet, by
selecting those whose orientation strength is
above the heuristically identified threshold
value of 0.4. The words whose orientation
strength is below 0.4 are ambiguous and may
lose their subjectivity in the target language
after translation. A total of weakly subjective
2652 words are discarded from the
Subjectivity word list as proposed in (Wiebe
and Riloff, 2006).
In the next stage the words whose POS
category in the Subjectivity word list is
undefined and tagged as “anypos” are
considered. These words may generate sense
ambiguity issues in the next stages of
subjectivity detection. The words are checked
in the SentiWordNet list for validation. If a
match is found with certain POS category, the
word is added to the new merged sentiment

lexicon. Otherwise the word is discarded to
avoid ambiguities later.
Some words in the Subjectivity word list are
inflected e.g., memories. These words would
be stemmed during the translation process, but
some words present no subjectivity property
after stemming (memory has no subjectivity
property). A word may occur in the
subjectivity list in many inflected forms.
Individual clusters for the words sharing the
same root form are created and then checked in
the SentiWordNet for validation. If the root
word exists in the SentiWordNet then it is
assumed that the word remains subjective after
stemming and hence is added to the new list.
Otherwise the cluster is completely discarded
to avoid any further ambiguities.
Various statistics of the English Senti-
WordNet and Subjectivity Word List are re-
ported in Table 1.

sifier (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2009) has
been applied on Multi Perspective Question
Answering (MPQA) (NEWS) and IMDB Mov-
ie review corpus along with English Senti-
WordNet. The result of the subjectivity clas-
sifier on both the corpus proves that the cover-
age of the Bengali SentiWordNet is reasonably
good. The subjectivity word list used in the
subjectivity classifier is developed from the
IMDB corpus and hence the experiments on
the IMDB corpus have yielded high precision
and recall scores. The developed Bengali Sen-
tiWordNet is domain independent and still its
coverage is very good as shown in Table 4.

<bodyText confidence="0.998505625">
SentiWordNet(s) for Indian languages are be-
ing developed using various approaches. The
game based technique may be directed towards
a new way for the creation of linguistic data
not just only for SentiWordNet(s) but in either
areas of NLP too.
Presently only the Bengali SentiWordNet19
is downloadable from the author’s web page.

<abstract confidence="0.9843551">The discipline where sentiment/ opinion/ emotion has been identified and classified in human written text is well known as sentiment analysis. A typical computational approach to sentiment analysis starts with prior polarity lexicons where entries are tagged with their prior out of context polarity as human beings perceive using their cognitive knowledge. Till date, all research efforts found in sentiment lexicon literature deal mostly with English texts. In this article, we propose multiple computational techniques like, WordNet based, dictionary based, corpus based or generative approaches for generating SentiWordNet(s) for Indian languages. Currently, SentiWordNet(s) are being developed for three Indian languages: Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. An online intuitive game has been developed to create and validate the developed SentiWordNet(s) by involving Internet population. A number of automatic, semi-automatic and manual validations and evaluation methodologies have been adopted to measure the coverage and credibility of the developed SentiWordNet(s).</abstract>

A number of automatic, semi-automatic and manual validations and evaluation methodologies have been adopted to measure the coverage and credibility of the developed SentiWordNet(s). 1 Introduction Sentiment analysis and classification from electronic text is a hard semantic disambiguation problem. The regulating aspects of semantic orientation of a text are natural language context information (Pang et al., 2002) language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the time dimension (Read, 2005). The following example shows that the polarity tag associated with a sentiment word depends on the time dimension. During 90’s mobile phone users generally reported in various online reviews about their color phones but in recent times color phone is not just enough. People are fascinated and influenced by touch screen and various software(s) installation facilities on these new generation gadgets. In typical computational approaches (Higashinaka et al., 2007; Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2000) to sentiment analysis researchers consid</context>

The first type contains the semantically contrasting word pairs but the second type includes orthographic suffix/affix as a clue. The second type is highly productive using very less number of affixation rules. Degree of antonymy (Mohammad et al., 2008) is defined to encompass the complete semantic range as a combined measure of the contrast in meaning conveyed by two antonymy words and is identified by distributional hypothesis. It helps to measure relative sentiment score of a word and its antonym. Kumaran et al., (2008) introduced a beautiful method for automatic data creation by online intuitive games. A methodology has been 57 proposed for community creation of linguistic data by community collaborative framework known as wikiBABEL3. It may be described as a revolutionary approach to automatically create large credible linguistic data by involving Internet population for content creation. For the present task we prefer to involve all the available methodologies to automatically and semi-automatically create and validate SentiWordNet(s) for three Indian languages.
