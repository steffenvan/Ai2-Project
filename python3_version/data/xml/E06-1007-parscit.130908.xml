We present an implemented machine
learning system for the automatic detec-
tion of nonreferential it in spoken dialog.
The system builds on shallow features ex-
tracted from dialog transcripts. Our exper-
iments indicate a level of performance that
makes the system usable as a preprocess-
ing filter for a coreference resolution sys-
tem. We also report results of an annota-
tion study dealing with the classification of
it by naive subjects.

<bodyText confidence="0.996048850746269">
This paper describes an implemented system for
the detection of nonreferential it in spoken multi-
party dialog. The system has been developed on
the basis of meeting transcriptions from the ICSI
Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003), and it is in-
tended as a preprocessing component for a coref-
erence resolution system in the DIANA-Summ di-
alog summarization project. Consider the follow-
ing utterance:
MN059: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I’m sure I could learn a lot
about um, yeah, just how to - how to come up with
these structures, cuz it’s - it’s very easy to whip up
something quickly, but it maybe then makes sense to -
to me, but not to anybody else, and - and if we want to
share and integrate things, they must - well, they must
be well designed really. (Bed017)
In this example, only one of the three instances of
it is a referential pronoun: The first it appears in
the reparandum part of a speech repair (Heeman
&amp; Allen, 1999). It is replaced by a subsequent al-
teration and is thus not part of the final utterance.
The second it is the subject of an extraposition
construction and serves as the placeholder for the
postposed infinitive phrase to whip up something
quickly. Only the third it is a referential pronoun
which anaphorically refers to something.
The task of the system described in the follow-
ing is to identify and filter out nonreferential in-
stances of it, like the first and second one in the
example. By preventing these instances from trig-
gering the search for an antecedent, the precision
of a coreference resolution system is improved.
Up to the present, coreference resolution has
mostly been done on written text. In this domain,
the detection of nonreferential it has by now be-
come a standard preprocessing step (e.g. Ng &amp;
Cardie (2002)). In the few works that exist on
coreference resolution in spoken language, on the
other hand, the problem could be ignored, because
almost none of these aimed at developing a sys-
tem that could handle unrestricted input. Eck-
ert &amp; Strube (2000) focus on an unimplemented
algorithm for determining the type of antecedent
(mostly NP vs. non-NP), given an anaphorical
pronoun or demonstrative. The system of Byron
(2002) is implemented, but deals mainly with how
referents for already identified discourse-deictic
anaphors can be created. Finally, Strube &amp; M¨uller
(2003) describe an implemented system for re-
solving 3rd person pronouns in spoken dialog, but
they also exclude nonreferential it from consider-
ation. In contrast, the present work is part of a
project to develop a coreference resolution system
that, in its final implementation, can handle unre-
stricted multi-party dialog. In such a system, no
a priori knowledge is available about whether an
instance of it is referential or not.
The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows: Section 2 describes the current state of the
art for the detection of nonreferential it in writ-
ten text. Section 3 describes our corpus of tran-
scribed spoken dialog. It also reports on the anno-
tation that we performed in order to collect train-
ing and test data for our machine learning experi-
ments. The annotation also offered interesting in-
sights into how reliably humans can identify non-
referential it in spoken language, a question that,

to our knowledge, has not been adressed before.

machine learning experiments, Section 5 contains

2 Detecting Nonreferential It In Text
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993815625">
Nonreferential it is a rather frequent phenomenon
in written text, though it still only constitutes a mi-
nority of all instances of it. Evans (2001) reports
that his corpus of approx. 370.000 words from the
SUSANNE corpus and the BNC contains 3.171
examples of it, approx. 29% of which are nonref-
erential. Dimitrov et al. (2002) work on the ACE
corpus and give the following figures: the news-
paper part of the corpus (ca. 61.000 words) con-
tains 381 instances of it, with 20.7% being nonref-
erential, and the news wire part (ca. 66.000 words)
contains 425 instances of it, 16.5% of which are
nonreferential. Boyd et al. (2005) use a 350.000
word corpus from a variety of genres. They count
2.337 instances of it, 646 of which (28%) are non-
referential. Finally, Clemente et al. (2004) report
that in the GENIA corpus of medical abstracts the
percentage of nonreferential it is as high as 44%
of all instances of it. This may be due to the fact
that abstracts tend to contain more stereotypical
formulations.
It is worth noting here that in all of the above
studies the referential-nonreferential decision im-
plicitly seems to have been made by the author(s).
To our knowledge, no study provides figures re-
garding the reliability of this classification.
Paice &amp; Husk (1987) is the first corpus-based
study on the detection of nonreferential it in writ-
ten text. From examples drawn from a part of
the LOB corpus (technical section), Paice &amp; Husk
(1987) create rather complex pattern-based rules
(like SUBJECT VERB it STATUS to TASK),
and apply them to an unseen part of the corpus.
They report a final success rate of 92.2% on the
test corpus. Nowadays, most current coreference
resolution systems for written text include some
means for the detection of nonreferential it. How-
ever, evaluation figures for this task are not always
given. As the detection of nonreferential it is sup-
posed to be a filtering condition (as opposed to
a selection condition), high precision is normally
considered to be more important than high recall.
A false negative, i.e. a nonreferential it that is not
detected, can still be filtered out later when reso-
lution fails, while a false positive, i.e. a referen-
tial it that is wrongly removed, is simply lost and
will necessarily harm overall recall. Another point
worth mentioning is that mere classification accu-
racy (percent correct) is not an appropriate eval-
uation measure for the detection of nonreferential
it. Accuracy will always be biased in favor of pre-
dicting the majority class referential which, as the
above figures show, can amount to over 80%.
The majority of works on detecting nonreferen-
tial it in written text uses some variant of the partly
syntactic and partly lexical tests described by Lap-
pin &amp; Leass (1994), the first work about computa-
tional pronoun resolution to address the potential
benefit of detecting nonreferential it. Lappin &amp;
Leass (1994) mainly supply a short list of modal
adjectives and cognitive verbs, as well as seven
syntactic patterns like It is Cogv-ed that S. Like
many works that treat the detection of nonrefer-
ential it only as one of several steps of the coref-
erence resolution process, Lappin &amp; Leass (1994)
do not give any figures about the performance of
this filtering method.
Dimitrov et al. (2002) modify and extend the
approach of Lappin &amp; Leass (1994) in several re-
spects. They extend the list of modal adjectives
to 86 (original: 15), and that of cognitive verbs to
22 (original: seven). They also increase the cov-
erage of the syntactic patterns, mainly by allowing
for optional adverbs at certain positions. Dimitrov
et al. (2002) report performance figures for each
of their syntactic patterns individually. The first
thing to note is that 41.3% of the instances of non-
referential it in their corpus do not comply with
any of the patterns they use, so even if each pat-
tern worked perfectly, the maximum recall to be
reached with this method would be 58.7%. The ac-
tual recall is 37.7%. Dimitrov et al. (2002) do not
give any precision figures. One interesting detail
is that the pattern involving the passive cognitive
verb construction accounts for only three instances
in the entire corpus, of which only one is found.
Evans (2001) employs memory-based machine
learning. He represents instances of it as vectors of
35 features. These features encode, among other
things, information about the parts of speech and
lemmata of words in the context of it (obtained au-
tomatically). Other features encode the presence
or absence of, resp. the distance to, certain ele-
ment sequences indicative of pleonastic it, such as
complementizers or present participles. Some fea-
tures explicitly reference structural properties of
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999991428571429">
the text, like position of the it in its sentence, and
position of the sentence in its paragraph. Sentence
boundaries are also used to limit the search space
for certain distance features. Evans (2001) reports
a precision of 73.38% and a recall of 69.25%.
Clemente et al. (2004) work on the GENIA cor-
pus of medical abstracts. They assume perfect pre-
processing by using the manually assigned POS
tags from the corpus. The features are very similar
to those used by Evans (2001). Using an SVM ma-
chine learning approach, Clemente et al. (2004)
obtain an accuracy of 95.5% (majority base line:
approx. 56%). They do not report any precision or
recall figures. Clemente et al. (2004) also perform
an analysis of the relative importance of features in
various settings. It turns out that features pertain-
ing to the distance or number of complementizers
following the it are consistently among the most
important.
Finally, Boyd et al. (2005) also use a machine
learning approach. They use 25 features, most of
which represent syntactic patterns like it VERB
ADJ that. These features are numeric, having as
their value the distance from a given instance of
it to the end of the match, if any. Pattern match-
ing is limited to sentences, sentence breaks being
identified by punctuation. Other features encode
the (simplified) POS tags that surround a given in-
stance of it. Like in the system of Clemente et al.
(2004), all POS tag information is obtained from
the corpus, so no (error-prone) automatic tagging
is performed. Boyd et al. (2005) obtain a precision
of 82% and a recall of 71% using a memory-based
machine learning approach, and a similar preci-
sion but much lower recall (42%) using a decision
tree classifier.
In summary, the best approaches for detecting
nonreferential it in written text already work rea-
sonably well, yielding an F-measure of over 70%
(Evans, 2001; Boyd et al., 2005). This can at least
partly be explained by the fact that many instances
are drawn from texts coming from rather stereo-
typical domains, like e.g. news wire text or scien-
tific abstracts. Also, some make the rather unreal-
istic assumption of perfect POS information, and
even those who do not make this assumption take
advantage of the fact that automatic POS tagging
is generally very good for these types of text. This
is especially true in the case of complementizers
(like that) which have been shown to be highly in-
dicative of extraposition constructions. Structural
properties of the context of it, including sentence
boundaries and position within sentence or para-
graph, are also used frequently, either as numeri-
cal features in their own right, or as means to limit
the search space for pattern matching.

3 Nonreferential It in Spoken Dialog
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999514285714286">
Spontaneous speech differs considerably from
written text in at least two respects that are rele-
vant for the task described in this paper: it is less
structured and more noisy than written text, and it
contains significantly more instances of it, includ-
ing some types of nonreferential it not found in
written text.

3.1 The ICSI Meeting Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95168145">
The ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) is
a collection of 75 manually transcribed group dis-
cussions of about one hour each, involving 3 to 13
speakers. It features a semiautomatically gener-
ated segmentation in which the corpus developers
tried to track the flow of the dialog by inserting
segment starts approximately whenever a person
started talking. Each of the resulting segments is
associated with a single speaker and contains start
and end time information. The transcription con-
tains manually added punctuation, and it also ex-
plicitly records disfluencies and speech repairs by
marking both interruption points and word frag-
ments (Heeman &amp; Allen, 1999). Consider the fol-
lowing example:
ME010: Yeah. Yeah. No, no. There was a whole co- There
was a little contract signed. It was - Yeah. (Bed017)
Note, however, that the extent of the reparandum
(i.e. the words that are replaced by following
words) is not part of the transcription.

3.2 Annotation of It
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937946833333333">
We performed an annotation with two external an-
notators. We chose annotators outside the project
in order to exclude the possibility that our own pre-
conceived ideas influence the classification. The
purpose of the annotation was twofold: Primar-
ily, we wanted to collect training and test data for
our machine learning experiments. At the same
time, however, we wanted to investigate how re-
liably this kind of annotation could be done. The
annotators were asked to label instances of it in
five ICSI Meeting Corpus dialogs1 as belonging
1Bed017, Bmr001, Bns003, Bro004, and Bro005

to one of the classes normal, vague, discarded,
extrapos it, prop-it, or other.2 The idea behind
using this five-fold classification (as opposed to a
binary one) was that we wanted to be able to in-
vestigate the inter-annotator reliability for each of
the sub-types individually (cf. below). The first
two classes are sub-types of referential it: Normal
applies to the normal, anaphoric use of it. Vague
it (Eckert &amp; Strube, 2000) is a form of it which
is frequent in spoken language, but rare in written
text. It covers instances of it which are indeed ref-
erential, but whose referent is not an identifiable
linguistic string in the context of the pronoun. A
frequent (but not the only) type of vague it is the
one referring to the current discourse topic, like in
the following example:
ME011: [...] [M]y vision of it is you know each of us
will have our little P D A in front of us Pause and so
the acoustics - uh you might want to try to match the
acoustics. (Bmr001)
Note that we treat vague it as referential here even
though, in the context of a coreference resolution
preprocessing filter, it would make sense to treat
it as nonreferential since it does not have an an-
tecedent that it can be linked to. However, we fol-
low Evans (2001) in assuming that the information
that is required to classify an instance of it as a
mention of the discourse topic is far beyond the lo-
cal information that can reasonably be represented
for an instance of it.
The classes discarded, extrapos it and prop-
it are sub-types of nonreferential it. The first two
types have already been shown in the example in
Section 1. The class prop-it3 was included to
cover cases like the following:
FE004: So it seems like a lot of - some of the issues are the
same. [...] (Bed017)
The annotators received instructions including de-
scriptions and examples for all categories, and a
decision tree diagram. The diagram told them e.g.
to use wh-question formation as a test to distin-
guish extrapos it and prop-it on the one hand
from normal and vague on the other. The crite-
rion for distinguishing between the latter two phe-
nomena was to use normal if an antecedent could
be identified, and vague otherwise. For normal

2The actual tag set was larger, including categories like
idiom which, however, the annotators turned out to use ex-
tremely rarely only. These values are therefore conflated in
the category other in the following.

pronouns, the annotators were also asked to indi-
cate the antecedent. The annotators were also told
to tag as extrapos it only those cases in which
an extraposed element (to-infinitive, ing-form or
that-clause with or without complementizer) was
available, and to use prop-it otherwise. The an-
notators individually performed the annotation of
the five dialogs. The results of this initial anno-
tation were analysed and problems and ambigui-
ties in the annotation scheme were identified and
corrected. The annotators then individually per-
formed the actual annotation again. The results
reported in the following are from this second an-
notation.
We then examined the inter-annotator reliability
of the annotation by calculating the n score (Car-
letta, 1996). The figures are given in Table 1. The
category other contains all cases in which one of
the minor categories was selected. Each table cell
contains the percentage agreement and the n value
for the respective category. The final column con-
tains the overall n for the entire annotation.
The table clearly shows that the classification
of it in spoken dialog appears to be by no means
trivial: With one exception, n for the category
normal is below .67, the threshold which is nor-
mally regarded as allowing tentative conclusions
(Krippendorff, 1980). The n for the nonreferen-
tial sub-categories extrapos it and prop-it is also
very variable, the figures for the former being on
average slightly better than those for the latter,
but still mostly below that threshold. In view of
these results, it would be interesting to see simi-
lar annotation experiments on written texts. How-
ever, a study of the types of confusions that oc-
cur showed that quite a few of the disagreements
arise from confusions of sub-categories belonging
to the same super-category, i.e. referential resp.
nonreferential. That means that a decision on the
level of granularity that is needed for the current
work can be done more reliably.
The data used in the machine learning experi-
ments described in Section 4 is a gold standard
variant that the annotators agreed upon after the
annotation was complete. The distribution of the
five classes in the gold standard data is as follows:
normal: 588, vague: 48, discarded: 222, extra-
posit: 71, and prop-it: 88.

4.1 Training and Test Data Generation
4.1.1 Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934142857143">
We extracted all instances of it and the segments
(i.e. speaker units) they occurred in. This pro-
duced a total of 1.017 instances, 62.5% of which
were referential. Each instance was labelled as
ref or nonref accordingly. Since a single segment
does not adequately reflect the context of the it,
we used the segments’ time information to join
segments to larger units. We adopted the concept
and definition of spurt (Shriberg et al., 2001), i.e.
a sequence of speech not interrupted by any pause
longer than 500ms, and joined segments with time
distances below this threshold. For each instance
of it, features were generated mainly on the basis
of this spurt.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.766965">
4.1.2 Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999741866666667">
For each spurt, we performed the following pre-
processing steps: First, we removed all single
dashes (i.e. interruption points), non-lexicalised
filled pauses (like em and eh), and all word frag-
ments. This affected only the string representa-
tion of the spurt (used for pattern matching later),
so the information that a certain spurt position was
associated with e.g. an interruption point or a filled
pause was not lost.
We then ran a simple algorithm to detect di-
rect repetitions of 1 to up to 6 words, where re-
moved tokens were skipped. If a repetition was
found, each token in the first occurrence was
tagged as discarded. Finally, we also temporarily
removed potential discourse markers by matching
each spurt against a short list of expressions like
actually, you know, I mean, but also so and sort
of. This was done rather agressively and without
taking any context into account. The rationale for
doing this was that while discourse markers do
indeed convey important information to the dis-
course, they are not relevant for the task at hand
and can thus be considered as noise that can be re-
moved in order to make the (syntactic and lexical)
patterns associated with nonreferential it stand out
more clearly. For each spurt thus processed, POS
tags were obtained automatically with the Stan-
ford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). Although this
tagger is trained on written text, we used it without
any retraining.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.458383">
4.1.3 Feature Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998125">
One question we had to address was which infor-
mation from the transcription we wanted to use.
One can assume that using information like sen-
tence breaks or interruption points should be ex-
pected to help in the classification task at hand.
On the other hand, we did not want our system
to be dependent on this type of human-added in-
formation. Thus, we decided to do several setups
which made use of this information to various de-
grees. Different setups differed with respect to the
following options:
-use eos information: This option controls the
effect of explicit end-of-sentence information in
the transcribed data. If this option is active, this
information is used in two ways: Spurt strings are
trimmed in such a way that they do not cross sen-
tence boundaries. Also, the search space for dis-
tance features is limited to the current sentence.
-use interruption points: This option controls
the effect of explicit interruption points. If this op-
tion is active, this information is used in a similar
way as sentence boundary information.
All of the features described in the following
were obtained fully automatically. That means
that errors in the shallow feature generation meth-
ods could propagate into the model that was
learned from the data. The advantage of this ap-
proach is, however, that training and test data are
homogeneous. A model trained on partly erro-
neous data is supposed to be more robust against
similarly noisy testing data.
The first group of features consists of 21 sur-
face syntactic patterns capturing the left and right
context of it. Each pattern is represented by a bi-
nary feature which has either the value match or
nomatch. This type of pattern matching is done
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997265">

<bodyText confidence="0.999975566666667">
for two reasons: To get a simplified symbolic
representation of the syntactic context of it, and
to extract the other elements (nouns, verbs) from
its predicative context. The patterns are matched
using shallow (regular-expression based) methods
only.
The second group of features contains lexical
information about the predicative context of it. It
includes the verb that it is the grammatical sub-
ject resp. object of (if any). Further features are
the nouns that serve as the direct object (if it is
subject), and the noun resp. adjective complement
in cases where it appears in a copula construction.
All these features are extracted from the patterns
described above, and then lemmatized.
The third group of features captures the wider
context of it through distance (in tokens) to words
of certain grammatical categories, like next com-
plementizer, next it, etc.
The fourth group of features contains the fol-
lowing: oblique is a binary feature encoding
whether the it is preceeded by a preposition.
in seemlist is a feature that encodes whether or not
the verb that it is the subject of appears in the list
seem, appear, look, mean, happen, sound (from
Dimitrov et al. (2002)). discarded is a binary fea-
ture that encodes whether the it has been tagged as
discarded during preprocessing. The features are
listed in Table 2. Features of the first group are
only given as examples.

4.2 Machine Learning Experiment

<bodyText confidence="0.998451388888889">
We then applied machine learning in order to build
an automatic classifier for detecting nonreferential
instances of it, given a vector of features as de-
scribed above. We used JRip, the WEKA4 reim-
plementation of Ripper (Cohen, 1995). All fol-
lowing figures were obtained by means of ten-fold
cross-validation. Table 3 contains all results dis-
cussed in what follows.
In a first experiment, we did not use either of
the two options described above, so that no in-
formation about interruption points or sentence
boundaries was available during training or test-
ing. With this setting, the classifier achieved a re-
call of 55.1%, a precision of 71.9% and a resulting
F-measure of 62.4% for the detection of the class
nonreferential. The overall classification accuracy
was 75.1%.

it allows direct introspection of which of the fea-

that the discarded feature is very successful. The

correctly identified 83 instances of nonreferential
it, while it produced no false positives. Similarly,
the seem list feature alone was able to correctly
identify 22 instances, producing nine false posi-
tives. The following is an example of a more com-
plex rule involving distance features, which is also
very successful (37 true positives, 16 false posi-
tives):
dist_to_next_to &lt;= 8 and
dist_to_next_adj &lt;= 4
==&gt; class = nonref (53.0/16.0)
This rule captures the common pattern for ex-
traposition constructions like It is important to do
that.
The following rule makes use of the feature en-
coding the distance to the next complementizer
(14 true positives, five false positives):
obj_verb = null and
dist_to_next_comp &lt;= 5
==&gt; nonref (19.0/5.0)
The fact that these rules with these conditions
were learned show that the features found to be
most important for the detection of nonreferential
it in written text (cf. Section 2) are also highly rele-
vant for performing that task for spoken language.
We then ran a second experiment in which we
used sentence boundary information to restrict the
scope of both the pattern matching features and
the distance-related features. We expected this to
improve the performance of the model, as patterns
should apply less generously (and thus more ac-
curately), which could be expected to result in an
increase in precision. However, the second experi-
ment yielded a recall of 57.7%, a precision of only
70.1% and an F-measure of 63.3% for the detec-
tion of this class. The overall accuracy was 74.9%.
The system produced a mere five rules (compared
to seven before). The model produced the identi-
cal rule using the discarded-feature. The same ap-
plies to the seem list feature, with the difference
that both precision and recall of this rule were al-
tered: The rule now produced 23 true positives and
six false positives. The slightly higher recall of the
model using the sentence boundary information is
mainly due to a better coverage of the rule using
the features encoding the distance to the next to-
infinitive and the next adjective: it now produced

57 true positives and only 30 false positives.
We then wanted to compare the contribution
of the sentence breaks to that of the interruption
points. We ran another experiment, using only the
latter and leaving everything else unaltered. This
time, the overall performance of the classifier im-
proved considerably: recall was 60.9%, precision
80.0%, F-measure 69.2%, and the overall accu-
racy was 79.6%. The resulting model was rather
complicated, including seven complex rules. The
increase in recall is mainly due to the following
rule, which is not easily interpreted:5
it-s = match and
dist-to-next-nominal &gt;=21 and
dist-to-next-adj &gt;=500 and
subj-verb = null
==&gt; nonref (116.0/31.0)
The considerable improvement (in particular
in precision) brought about by the interruption
points, and the comparatively small impact of sen-
tence boundary information, might be explainable
in several ways. For instance, although sentence
boundary information allows to limit both the
search space for distance features and the scope of
pattern matching, due to the shallow nature of pre-
processing, what is between two sentence breaks
is by no means a well-formed sentence. In that
respect, it seems plausible to assume that smaller

units (as delimited by interruption points) may be
beneficial for precision as they give rise to fewer
spurious matches. It must also be noted that inter-
ruption points do not mark arbitrary breaks in the
flow of speech, but that they can signal important
information (cf. Heeman &amp; Allen (1999)).

5 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presented a machine learning system
for the automatic detection of nonreferential it in
spoken dialog. Given the fact that our feature ex-
traction methods are only very shallow, the re-
sults we obtained are satisfying. On the one hand,
the good results that we obtained when utilizing
information about interruption points (P:80.0% /
R:60.9% / F:69.2%) show the feasibility of detect-
ing nonreferential it in spoken multi-party dialog.
To our knowledge, this task has not been tackled
before. On the other hand, the still fairly good
results obtained by only using automatically de-
termined features (P:71.9% / R:55.1% / F:62.4%)
show that a practically usable filtering compo-
nent for nonreferential it can be created even with
rather simple means.
All experiments yielded classifiers that are con-
servative in the sense that their precision is consid-
erably higher than their recall. This makes them
particularly well-suited as filter components.

work is part of, only the fully automatic variant is
an option. Therefore, future work must try to im-
prove its recall without harming its precision (too
much). One way to do that could be to improve the
recognition (i.e. correct POS tagging) of grammat-
ical function words (in particular complementizers
like that) which have been shown to be important
indicators for constructions with nonreferential it.
Other points of future work include the refinement
of the syntactic pattern features and the lexical fea-
tures. E.g., the values (i.e. mostly nouns, verbs,
and adjectives) of the lexical features, which have
been almost entirely ignored by both classifiers,
could be generalized by mapping them to common
WordNet superclasses.
