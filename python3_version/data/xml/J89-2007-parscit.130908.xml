Schiffer&apos;s book is a devastating critique of analytical
philosophy of language. The author aims at undermining
the philosopher&apos;s confidence in the facts about language
and thought that are usually taken as uncontroversial
starting points. Schiffer argues that the questions that
now define philosophy of language have false presup-
positions and that the most prominent philosophical
theories related to those questions are hopeless endeav-
ors.
In the past years Schiffer was much taken with
Grice&apos;s program, i.e., with the idea of &amp;quot;reducing the
semantic to the psychological by first defining speaker-
meaning in terms of certain species of semantical be-
haviour whose specification did not itself involve any-
thing semantical, and then defining expression-meaning
in terms of the reduced notion of speaker-meaning&amp;quot; (p.
xiii). Now Schiffer says that this program of intention-
based semantics (IBS) is impossible to implement for it is
impossible to account for the content of beliefs in a
language-independent way and to state propositional-
attitude facts in sentences devoid of mentalistic idioms.
In trying to deal with such negative conclusions, Schif-
fer came to forsake a great amount of what most
philosophers of language still accept, and was drawn to
the conclusion that such hypotheses as the existence of
semantic facts and compositionality of meaning are
misleading. The book is therapeutic rather than con-
structive: it belongs to the trend beginning with Witt-
genstein&apos;s Philosophical Investigations (1953), and con-
tinued, more recently, by Richard Rorty&apos;s Philosophy
and the Mirror of Nature (1979). It doesn&apos;t propose a
new theory of meaning, but it puts the analytical phi-
losophers in a critical position by attacking their profes-
sional role and their conceptual schemes.
I think that this book will be interesting even for
people approaching it from an Al or computational
linguistics perspective, for many of the philosophical
topics discussed here can&apos;t be ignored by computational
linguists concerned with semantic interpretation: e.g.,
analysis of belief and modal sentences, recognition of
speaker&apos;s intentions, and compositionality of natural
languages. I can&apos;t discuss all of them here, so I&apos;ll
concentrate on the last one, which according to me
should be a central issue for any theory of natural
language understanding (NLU). Schiffer&apos;s idea that the
semantics of natural language is not compositional is
hard to accept, for it seems too tied to his refusal of IBS.
Nevertheless, I think that his view can offer us some
positive insights. Until now, research in NLU has been
notably successful mainly in the area of syntax. The
analysis of the meanings of the words has no firm
foundation in the works of the computational commu-
nity: most of the computational semantic analysis is still
close to the procedural paradigm of the late &apos;60s.
Recently Graeme Hirst (1987) stressed this situation and
pointed out that compositionality should be an impor-
tant desideratum for a theory claiming to provide such
foundations.
Compositionality is the principle according to which
the semantic value of a sentence depends on those of its
parts. Within philosophy of language it is known as
Frege&apos;s Principle, and is regarded as an adequacy crite-
rion for semantic theories of natural languages. It is not
surprising, therefore, that Schiffer&apos;s attempt to under-
mine the theoretical basis of the philosophy of language
also involves the rejection of the compositionality prin-
ciple. More precisely, Schiffer comes to deny &amp;quot;the
reason for supposing that natural languages have com-
positional semantics&amp;quot;(p. xvi), after having argued that
the relational theory of propositional attitude is false. In
fact, Schiffer says:
On the one hand, it would appear that if, as many
suppose, natural languages have compositional, truth-
theoretic semantics, then the relational theory of propo-
sitional attitudes must be correct; while, on the other
hand, I have argued that the relational theory is false. I
must therefore deny that the relational construal of
&amp;quot;believes&amp;quot; is required by its accommodation within a
compositional semantics, or else deny that natural lan-
guages have compositional semantics. I opt for the latter
course. (p. xviii)
Schiffer&apos; s position seems to be close to the widely held
opinion that compositionality is unmaintainable if one
denies the relational thesis on propositional attitudes.
But he also seems to argue for a more substantial thesis,
i.e., for the idea that compositionality is not a feature of
natural language semantics. Schiffer admits that corn-
positionality might seem a good way to account for the
ability of native speakers to understand utterances of
novel sentences:

It may seem obvious that one understands the utterance
of a novel sentence because one knows the meanings of
the words contained in it and, in some sense, knows a rule
for determining the meaning of the sentence on the basis
of its syntax and the meanings of its words. (p. 179)
Nevertheless, he argues that the evidence for a compo-
sitional truth-theoretic semantics is pretty glib, because
one can give a correct model of language understanding
and productivity without assuming a compositional
truth-theoretic semantics.
In the seventh chapter of the book he suggests a
counterexample to the compositional view about lan-
guage understanding. He describes a possible world in
which a human computer, Harvey, understands a lan-
guage E, as complex as English. The author analyzes
Harvey&apos;s comprehension of some sentences and he
draws a picture in which heuristic tools, such as the
&apos;conceptual roles&apos; of some expressions of Harvey&apos;s
neural language of thought, allow him to show that
&amp;quot;there could be a correct psychological model of a
person&apos;s language processing that does not presuppose
a compositional semantics for the mastered language&amp;quot;
(p. 205).
But one might object that if compositional semantics
is not needed in order to account for language under-
standing, it is needed in order to explain what Schiffer
calls &amp;quot;the platitude&amp;quot;, i.e., the idea that the meanings of
sentences are determined by their syntax and the mean-
ings of their words. In Chapter 8, Schiffer argues against
this objection by introducing other heuristic notions,
such as the &amp;quot;saying-potential&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;processing
role&amp;quot; of linguistic expression. In the sentence &amp;quot;Michel
believes that his car was stolen&amp;quot;, the word &amp;quot;believes&amp;quot;
has a processing role that determines its saying potential
each time the word is used. &amp;quot;Believes&amp;quot; is a semantic
primitive, &amp;quot;but it is not a semantic primitive in any
sense appropriate to a compositional semantics, for no
base axiom, no satisfaction clause, can be written for
&apos;believes&apos; that could take its place in a true truth theory
for English&amp;quot; (p. 216).
Schiffer does not want to deny all the aspects of
semantic compositionality, nor that natural languages
contain truth-affecting iterative devices (p. 208). What
he denies is the relevance of truth-theoretic semantics
to an account of language understanding and productiv-
ity. He denies that something like analytic philosophy is
possible, but in the meantime he suggests that the
compositionality of natural language should be ex-
plained via cognitive models of linguistic behaviour. At
the very end of his book, he seems to set up an alliance
with cognitive science in order to explain facts about
language which do need explanation. They are facts
about language comprehension, about the ways in
which we store, represent, and process information.
But, Schiffer says, these &amp;quot;are not philosophical ques-
tions (although the skills of the philosopher would be
relevant to answering them)&amp;quot; (p. 271).

It is always regrettable when the proceedings of confer-
ences appear a long time after they were held, in this
case nearly four years, but it is even more so in a rapidly
changing field such as machine translation (MT). Devel-
opments since this MT tutorial was organized by the
Dalle Molle Institute for Semantic and Cognitive Stud-
ies (ISSCO) in early 1984 mean that many of the
contributions have now predominantly historical inter-
est. They are, however, no less valuable since many are
accounts of MT systems which have not been bettered
in comprehensiveness before or since. In keeping with
its historical character and its originally-intended role as
a general introduction to the state of the art in MT, the
volume contains a mixture of historical surveys, discus-
sions of linguistic and computational problems, and
detailed descriptions of major systems. It does not
include papers on practical implementations of MT
systems, on comparative evaluations of MT output, or
on the impact of MT on the translation industry. Some
readers may regret their absence but the value of the
collection lies precisely in its emphasis on the linguistic
features of MT systems, and on the more theoretical
aspects of MT research. Contributions have been di-
vided into three sections: Part 1, containing essentially
background papers; Part 2, devoted mainly to software;
and Part 3, to accounts of particular MT systems.
Part 1 opens with two general historical overviews by
Beat Buchmann covering MT history until the notorious
ALPAC report in 1966, and by Susan Warwick on
developments since 1966. Although necessarily brief,
