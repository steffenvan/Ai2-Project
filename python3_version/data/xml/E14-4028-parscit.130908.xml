<bodyText confidence="0.999440153846154">
In this paper, we describe the process of rule-
based conversion of Russian dependency
treebank into the Stanford dependency (SD)
schema. The motivation behind this project is
the expansion of the number of languages that
have treebank resources available in one
consistent annotation schema. Conversion
includes creation of Russian-specific SD
guidelines, defining conversion rules from the
original treebank schema into the SD model
and evaluation of the conversion results. The
converted treebank becomes part of a
multilingual resource for NLP purposes.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999773094339623">
Dependency parsing has provided new methods
and resources for natural language technology
tasks in recent years. Dependency treebanks are
now available for many languages and parsed
data is used for improving machine translation,
search engines and other NLP applications.
While data resources are relatively common for
monolingual tasks, there is a growing need for
consistently annotated multilingual data. First
larger activities in generating comparable
standardized sets of multilingual parsed data
were presented in CONLL shared tasks
(Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007;
Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajič et al., 2009). More
recently, cross-language consistency has been
achieved by using one universal schema for all
covered languages (McDonald et al., 2013). This
universal treebank schema uses consistent sets of
part-of-speech (POS) (Petrov et al., 2012) and
dependency labels (deprel) following the
Stanford typed dependencies representation (SD)
(de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). The
consistent treebank schema has many advantages,
mainly the more straightforward possibility to
build applications for multiple languages
(McDonald et al., 2011), though it also presents
challenges such as handling language-specific
features among languages of different types
without introducing conflicts. A certain level of
generalization of language features that might
lead to simplification is needed, as already
highlighted by McDonald et al. (2013). For such
universal multilingual treebank model, more
resources can be built manually or they can be
obtained by converting existing treebanks that
follow different parsing schemas into one
consistent treebank model. For the SD schema,
treebanks for several languages already have
been built using the manual annotation
procedures (McDonald et al, 2013; Souček et al.,
2013). There are also other existing treebanks
covering languages from different families where
the SD schema was applied (e.g. Chang et al.,
2009 for Chinese; Haverinen et al., 2010 for
Finnish; Seraji et al., 2012 for Persian; Tsarfaty,
2013 for Hebrew). Treebank conversion was
applied e.g. in Italian (Bosco et al, 2013). The
conversion model is a more suitable option for
languages for which treebanks are already
available, since manual annotation can be limited
and the annotation/conversion process can be
automated. In this paper, we describe the
conversion of an existing Russian treebank

including adaptations of the SD schema for
Russian (3), describe the conversion script (4)

terms of process efficiency and output accuracy)
to other tasks for which a similar process was

2 Conversion process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997547826087">
The conversion procedure used in our project is
similar to the process described in Bosco et al.
(2013). The very first step was the development
of the Russian-specific set of POS and the list of
Stanford dependency relations, compliant with
the standards presented by Petrov et al. (2012)
and de Marneffe and Manning (2008). Next, we
investigated POS and deprel sets for the original
treebank and defined conversion rules for
adapting data to our specific schema. A rule-
based conversion script was developed on a
small portion of the original data and the
remaining data was automatically converted. The
quality of the conversion output was monitored
by manual review of samples of converted data
and also using parser evaluation methods. During
the manual review, errors in samples of
converted data were manually corrected in order
to produce a gold standard data set; at the same
time further conversion rules were reported for
improving the conversion script. This cycle was
repeated several times until an acceptable output
quality was reached.

3 Source and target models
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99603">
3.1 Source model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998">
The source data for Russian are taken from the
SynTagRus treebank (Boguslavsky et al., 2000).
Just as in the basic SD model, SynTagRus pro-
vides a dependency tree for each sentence where
each word is connected to a head and assigned
one of 78 deprels, theoretically motivated by
Melcuk’s Meaning-Text theory (Melcuk, 1981).
Additionally, the treebank specifies POS
information as well as applicable morphological
information (gender, number, case, degree of
comparison, aspect, tense, person, voice).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997422">
3.2 Target model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990225">
The basic version of SD (de Marneffe and
Manning, 2008) counts approximately 53
dependency labels. They are used in conjunction
with a “universal” set of part-of-speech labels
(Petrov et al., 2012). Although our aim is to build
a resource that follows a consistent schema with
other existing SD languages, we decided to make
some minor modifications to the SD model to
account for language-specific phenomena and
thus minimize the loss of structural information.
Both the set of SD dependencies and of POS
labels were slightly adjusted to adapt the model
to Russian. All these specifics can be further
converted to the fully consistent SD model. The
following modifications were made to the
dependencies annotation schema:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9988939">
• scomp is introduced for the complements of
(ellipted) copulas.
• ocomp is introduced for verb complements that
are semantically predicated by the object of the
verb (e.g., I find [this idea]i interestingi.).
• gmod is introduced for genitive modifiers of
nominals; in turn, the poss relation for
prenominal possessive modifiers is eliminated.
• interj is introduced for discourse particles
attaching to nominals or verbs.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999628642857143">
Despite the modifications, the adopted model
still leads to losses in more fine-grained
information. An example where this becomes
especially visible are objects of verbs: the SD
model uses the two labels dobj and iobj for direct
and indirect objects. In Russian, there is a larger
range of object types; they are distinguished not
only morphologically, but also syntactically (e.g.
genitive of negation, whereby the negation of the
verb leads to the `switch&apos; of the direct object
from accusative to genitive). In order to capture
these distinctions, the original treebank uses five
relations (1-compl, 2-compl etc.). However, the
reduction to the two types dobj and iobj assumed

for our SD model `deletes&apos; these more fine-

4 Conversion Script
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990183">
4.1 General approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999">
The conversion script works with conversion
patterns, which specify the possible targets of a
source label and the conditions for this target to
be applied. Conditions can be specified in terms
of POS, morphological, lexical and structural
information. Most conversion patterns have a
regular formal basis and can be grouped into data
structures that are processed by standardized
functions. However, there are many patterns,
especially less frequent ones, that have an
irregular, more complex structure and thus have
to be described individually. In order to increase
the flexibility in formulating conversion patterns
by specifying lexical information, the script is
enriched with a set of lexical lists. These lexical
lists mostly contain closed classes of functional
words or idiosyncratic items, such as pronouns,
subordinating conjunctions or idioms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961315">
4.2 Conversion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877333333333">
Conversion acts on three types of information –
POS tags, dependency relations and tree
structures.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.691362">
4.2.1 POS tags
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999877">
The original data are annotated with five POS
labels (NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, CONJ); the
target set contains 15 POS labels. One-to-many
correspondences, for example the ambiguity of
original NOUN between target NOUN and
PRON, mostly occur in cases where the original
POS tag subsumes some smaller class of
functional words. As described above, word lists
were used to identify these closed classes and to
choose between the possible target POS tags.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.553573">
4.2.2 Dependency relations
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999489888888889">
In the original treebank, 78 dependency relations
are used; the target model contains 51 relations.
For some original dependency labels, a one-to-
one correspondence can be established. For
example, the original label advrb-subj, used for
nominals with an adverbial function, is always
converted to npadvmod. However, most original
dependency labels have multiple SD counterparts;
conditional branching is used to determine the
target relation for a given case. All types of
information available in the treebank – POS,
morphological, lexical and structural information
– can be used to formulate conditions; in most
cases, the specification for a given source
relation involves a mix of the different
information types.
Examples for the different types of conversion
conditions are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9951611">
• POS tag condition: attrib: convert to nn if
NOUN, amod when ADJ, prep when ADP
• Morphological condition: aux: convert to
npadvmod if in ablative case, iobj if in dative
case.
• Structural condition: explet: convert to mark
if dependent of purpcl or rcmod; ccomp if de-
pendent of complm.
• Lexical condition: aux: convert to neg if ex-
pressed by iehiu, else interj.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.502175">
4.2.3 Structural modifications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981825">
Structural modifications were introduced in
several cases; most of them are caused by the
reliance of SD on semantic heads and, thus, on
content words as heads. During conversion,
head-dependent structures are “switched” in
cases where the original head does not
correspond to the “semantic” head. Specifically,
this occurs in the following cases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987681375">
• Structures with auxiliary verbs (future tense,
passive voice): switch between auxiliary and
lexical verb, so that the auxiliary depends on the
lexical verb.
• Clauses introduced by subordinating con-
junctions: switch between introducing con-
junction and verb in the subordinate clause, so
that the verb in the subordinate clause depends
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.992744">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.8372375">
no more on the conjunction, but on the verb in
the matrix clause.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.730641">
• Coordination structures: in the original data, the
conjuncts and coordination particles form a chain,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.943800142857143">
whereby each node depends on the previous one.
In the target representation, all conjuncts and
coordination particles attach to the first conjunct.
4.2.4 Problems and inaccuracies - syntactic
under-specification
Under the SD model, different dependency
relations may apply to structurally identical, but
semantically different relations. For example,
postverbal nominals in instrumental case can be
either iobj (indirect object, corresponding to the
instrument argument) or npadvmod (nominal
adverbial); the relation applicable in a given case
depends on the lexical semantics of the verb and
the nominal:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.804875833333333">
(1) a. npadvmod(gaze, wolf):
cMOTpeTb 6O11KOM
gaze wolf.INS
‘to gaze angrily’
b. iobj(cut, knife):
pesaTb nOMCOM
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991387289473685">
cut knife.INS
‘to cut with a knife’
The semantic difference is not visible at a surface
level: there is no structural criterion which might
condition the choice of the target relation. Since
both structures are lexically productive, basing
the choice on word lists is also not a satisfactory
solution. Rather, the disambiguation of these and
similar cases would require a more fine-grained
semantic classification specifying valence frames
and selectional restrictions of verbs as well as
semantic features of nouns; in example (1), such
a classification would allow to identify verbs that
semantically select instruments (corresponding to
iobj) as well as nouns that can potentially act as
instruments. Besides, machine learning
techniques can also be used for disambiguation
based on the frequency of the lexical
constellations for a particular dependency
relation. Another problem are non-frequent
dependency relations and contexts of occurrence
which do not provide enough evidence for
postulating a reliable, universally applicable
conversion pattern. In the original treebank, 24
out of 78 dependency relations have a frequency
of occurrence of less than 100. Besides, after the
application of the conversion patterns, numerous
dependency relations remain non-converted,
because their contexts of occurrence are non-
frequent and thus also cannot be reliably
captured by conversion patterns. Our model uses
the generic label xdep to identify tokens for
which conversion was not successful. This label
mostly appears for tokens whose original deprels
do not allow for a rule-based characterization
because they are partially defined in semantic
terms, such as nonself-agent, distrib, elaborat
and mod-descr.

The presented script converts the original
Russian treebank fully into the SD schema. The
converted treebank data is owned by Google and
its availability can be checked with the data
owners. Conversion output precision was
measured with MaltEval (Nilsson and Nivre,
2008) using manually annotated 500 sentences as
gold standard and the same set processed with
the conversion script as a test data. We achieved
76.21% LAS and 83.84% UAS. Achieved LAS
is slightly lower than for similar work reported
for Italian (Bosco et al., 2013), where LAS for
different sub-models is between 79.94% and
84.14% in the parser output. Since the aim of this
project is to create comparable cross-language
data with acceptable precision within reasonable
time frame, the precision that we achieved seems
to be in acceptable range for the described
conversion task.

Just as in the basic SD model, SynTagRus provides a dependency tree for each sentence where each word is connected to a head and assigned one of 78 deprels, theoretically motivated by Melcuk’s Meaning-Text theory (Melcuk, 1981).

Our model uses the generic label xdep to identify tokens for which conversion was not successful. This label mostly appears for tokens whose original deprels do not allow for a rule-based characterization because they are partially defined in semantic terms, such as nonself-agent, distrib, elaborat and mod-descr. 5 Results The presented script converts the original Russian treebank fully into the SD schema. The converted treebank data is owned by Google and its availability can be checked with the data owners. Conversion output precision was measured with MaltEval (Nilsson and Nivre, 2008) using manually annotated 500 sentences as gold standard and the same set processed with the conversion script as a test data. We achieved 76.21% LAS and 83.84% UAS. Achieved LAS is slightly lower than for similar work reported for Italian (Bosco et al., 2013), where LAS for different sub-models is between 79.94% and 84.14% in the parser output. Since the aim of this project is to create comparable cross-language data with acceptable precision within reasonable time frame, the precision that we achieved seems to be in acceptable range for the described conversion task. 6 Conclusions and future</context>

(2013). The very first step was the development of the Russian-specific set of POS and the list of Stanford dependency relations, compliant with the standards presented by Petrov et al. (2012) and de Marneffe and Manning (2008). Next, we investigated POS and deprel sets for the original treebank and defined conversion rules for adapting data to our specific schema. A rulebased conversion script was developed on a small portion of the original data and the remaining data was automatically converted. The quality of the conversion output was monitored by manual review of samples of converted data and also using parser evaluation methods. During the manual review, errors in samples of converted data were manually corrected in order to produce a gold standard data set; at the same time </context>

Both the set of SD dependencies and of POS labels were slightly adjusted to adapt the model to Russian. All these specifics can be further converted to the fully consistent SD model.
