Nominalization is a highly pro-
ductive phenomena in most lan-
guages. The process of nominaliza-
tion ejects a verb from its syntactic
role into a nominal position. The
original verb is often replaced by a
semantically emptied support verb
(e.g., make a proposal). The choice
of a support verb for a given nomi-
nalization is unpredictable, causing
a problem for language learners as
well as for natural language pro-
cessing systems. We present here
a method of discovering support
verbs from an untagged corpus via
low-level syntactic processing and
comparison of arguments attached
to verbal forms and potential nom-
inalized forms. The result of the
process is a list of potential support
verbs for the nominalized form of a
given predicate.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999930068965517">
Nominalization, the transformation of a ver-
bal phrase into a nominal form, is possible
in most languages (Comrie and Thompson,
1990). Nominalizations are used for a vari-
ety of stylistic reasons: to avoid repetitions
of a verb, to avoid awkward intransitive uses
of transitive verbs, in technical descriptions
where passive is commonly used, etc.
Though, as a result of nominalization, the
original verb is ejected from its syntactic po-
sition, it often retains many of its thematic
roles. The original agents and patients can
reappear as genitival or adjectival modifiers
of the nominalized predicate. In the syntactic
place of the original verb can appear a seman-
tically impoverished verb.
The semantically impoverished verb, often
called a support verb, to be used with a nom-
inalized predicate structure is unpredictable,
Allerton (1982)[p. 76] writes:
Perhaps the most serious prob-
lem for these structures is that
there is no constant selection of
the empty verb: sometimes we find
have, sometimes take, sometimes
give, and rarely pay; sometimes
we have a choice between two or
more empty verbs e.g. have/take
a look ... We have little choice but
to record such irregularities in the
lexicon ...
For this reason, the collocational choice of a
support verb for a given nominalization is a
difficult problem for language learners, as well
as for natural language processor implemen-
tation.
We present here a method of deriving prob-
able support verbs for nominalized predicates
from corpora using low-level syntactic anal-
ysis and simple frequency statistics over its
results. This automatic procedure may be
looked upon as an aid to lexicographers, as an
independent extraction tool, or as a verifica-
tion of lexical collocation information stored
in a machine-based lexicon.
Since nominalized predicates can semanti-
cally drift over time to become concrete nouns
having lost all their thematic role, our method
first attempts to distinguish true nominaliza-
tions from concrete uses of the nominalized
surface form. This is done by comparing ap-
proximations to the argument/adjunct struc-
tures of verbal predicates to those of candi-
date nominalized forms in a large corpus. For
each selected nominalized form, syntactically
supporting verb information is extracted from
the corpus and then collated, providing the
candidates for support verbs.

1.1 The Nominalization Cline
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979939577981651">
The phenomenon of nominalization in En-
glish happens when a verb is replaced by a
noun construction using a gerundive or nomi-
nal form of the verb. The original subject and
objects of the verb can reappear as Saxon or
Norman genitives modifying the nominalized
form.
Quirk et al. (Quirk et al., 1985) distin-
guish nominalizations between deverbal and
verbal nouns. Examples of these are advice vs.
killing. Deverbal nouns are defined as records
of the action having taken place rather than
as description of the action itself. This ac-
counts for the contrast between their arriving
for a month and *their arrival for a month.
Deverbal nouns can be replaced by regu-
lar count nouns in any context, for exam-
ple painting as a deverbal noun in Brown&apos;s
paintings of his daughter can be replaced by
photograph whereas this is not the case with
the verbal noun painting in The painting of
Brown is as skillful as that of Gainsborough
which describes the action of painting itself
(Quirk et al., 1985)[p.12911.
As the following evidence shows, the se-
mantics of the verb and much of its syntactic
structure can be retained by either of its nom-
inalized forms:
She was surprised that the enemy de-
stroyed the city.
She was surprised by the ertemy(&apos;s) de-
stroying the city.
She was surprised by the enemy&apos;s de-
struction of the city.
The dine of nominalization can be seen in
the morphological changes&apos; that some predi-
cate undergo as they move from an inflected
verb (e.g. destroyed) to non-inflected verbal
noun (destroying) to a deverbal noun (de-
struction).
In this article we shall consider only dever-
bal nouns2 since these are the nominalizations
involving the collocational phenomena of sup-
port verbs.
A remaining problem with the deverbal
nouns is that the meaning of such nouns
can become concretized over time, by a
1The morphological processes involved in
transforming verbs into nominalizations are de-
scribed in (Quirk et al., 1985), Sections 1.43 (con-
version) and 1.30 (suffixation). See also 17.52 for
discussion of this dine.
20n a practical level, we will also accept as
deverbal nouns those forms ending in -ing which
are marked as nouns in our lexicon, e.g. warning.
metonymic association. Compare the uses of
proposal in :
He made his formal proposal to the full
committee.
He put the proposal in the drawer.
The concrete uses of deverbal nouns are not
involved in support verb constructions since
they have lost the semantics of actions, and
their attending thematic roles.
2 A very simple approach and
its problems
Looking for support verbs for nominalizations
might seem an easy problem at first, given
that these support verbs are always the main
verb for which the nominalization is the direct
object. What is needed is a low-level parser
that extracts verb-object relations from cor-
pora. Given such a parser, one might be
tempted to extract all the main verbs for a
given nominalized form and consider the most
frequent of these verbs the expected support
verbs.
As will be seen below, this approach is too
simple. The examples given above for pro-
posal show that a given word form may be
used with a meaning anywhere along the cline
from true nominalization to concrete nouns.
Counting verbs of which these concrete nouns
are direct objects will create noise hiding the
true support verbs.
Since real nominalizations are those that
still have verbal character, i.e. they have
retained the semantic roles from the verb,
we will try to recognize true nominalized
uses by comparing the most frequent argu-
ment/adjunct structures found in the corpus
around verbal uses of a given predicate to
those syntactic structures found around the
candidate nominalized forms&apos;.
We will define true nominalizations as
those which have a parallel syntactic structure
to the original verb. This is also in keeping
with the definition of nominalizations given in
(Quirk et al., 1985)[p. 1284
A noun phrase ... which has a
systematic correspondence with a
clause structure will be termed a
3Since these argument/adjunct structures are
difficult to recognize precisely without an elabo-
rate parser incorporating semantic analysis, we
decided to identify heuristically the structures
fulfilling these roles, for example, taking the most
frequently occurring prepositional phrases after
verbal sequences as adjuncts or arguments.

Nominalization. The noun head
of such a phrase is normally related
morphologically to a verb, or to an
adjective (i.e., a deverbal or dead-
jectival noun).
In this article we have been restricting the
term nominalization to the noun heading the
noun phrase.

3 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8058125">
In this section we explain our method for
extracting support verbs for nominalizations.
We suppose that we are given a pair of words:
a verb and its nominalized form. As explained
in the previous section, we are interested in
extracting only nominalized forms which have
not become concrete nouns, and that this will
be done by comparing syntactic structures at-
tached to the verb and noun forms. In order
to extract corpus evidence related to these
phenomena, we proceed as follows:
1. We generate all the morphologically
related forms of .the word pair using a
lexical transducer for English
(Karttunen et al., 1992). This list of
words will be used as corpus filter.
2. The lines of the corpus are tokenized
(Grefenstette and Tapanainen, 1994),
and only sentences containing one of
the word forms in the filter are retained.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9403825">
3. The corpus lines retained are
part-of-speech tagged (Cutting et al.,
1992). This allows us to divide the
corpus evidence into verb evidence and
noun evidence.
4. Using a robust surface parser

<bodyText confidence="0.998693666666667">
(Grefenstette, 1994), we derive the local
syntactic patterns involving the verbal
form and the nominalized form.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9557347">
5. Considering that nominalized forms
retain some of the verbal characteristics
of the underlying predicate, we want to
extract the most common
argument/adjunct structures found
around verbal uses of the predicate. As
an approximation, we extract here all
the prepositional phrases found after
the verb.
6. For nominal forms, we select only those

7. This sorted list is the list of candidate
support verbs for the nominalization.
This method assumes that the verb and
the nominalized form of the verb are given.
We have experimented with automatically ex-
tracting the nominalized form by using the
prepositional patterns extracted for the verb
in step 5. We extracted 6 megabytes of news-
paper articles containing a form of the verb
propose: propose, proposes, proposed, propos-
ing. Since one use of nominalization is to
avoid repetition of the verb form, we suppose
that the nominalization of propose is likely to
appear in the same articles. We extracted the
three most common prepositions following a
form of propose (step 5). We then extracted
the nouns appearing in these same articles
and which preceded these prepositions. \The
results4 appear in figure 1. Since a nominal-
ized form is normally morphologically related
to the verb form, almost any morphological
comparison method will pick proposal from
this list.
4Further experimentation has confirmed these
results, but indicate that it may sufficient to
simply tag a text, and perform morphological
comparison with the most commonly cooccurring
nouns in order to extract the nominalized forms
of verbs.

4 Experiment with
appeal-appeal
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9861082">
We have taken for example the case of the
verb appeal which was interesting since its
corresponding deverbal noun shares the same
surface form appeal. In order to extract cor-
pus evidence, we used a lexical transducer of
English that, given the surface word appeal,
produced all the inflected forms appeal, ap-
peal&apos;s, appealing, appealed, appeals and ap-
peals&apos;.
Using these surface forms as a filter, we
scanned 134 Megabytes of tokenized Asso-
ciated Press newswire stories from the year
19895. As a result of filtering, 6704 sen-
tences (1 Mbyte of text) were extracted. This
text was part-of-speech tagged using the Xe-
rox HMM tagger (Cutting et al., 1992). The
lexical entries corresponding to appeal were
tagged with the following tags: as a noun
(3910 times), as an active or infinitival verb
(1417), as a progressive verb (292), and as a
past participle (400).
This tagged text was then parsed by a
low-level dependency parser (Grefenstette,
1994)[Chap 3]. From the output of the de-
pendency parser we extracted all the lexically
normalized verbs of which appeal was tagged
as a direct object. The most common of these
verbs are shown in Figure 2.
Our speaker&apos;s intuition tells us that the
support verb for the nominalized use of ap-
peal is make. But this data does not give us
enough information to make this judgement,
since concrete versions as a separate entity
are not distinguishable from nominalizations
of the verb.
In order to separate nominalized uses of
the predicate appeal from concrete uses, we
will refer to the linguistic discussion presented
in the introduction that says that nominal-
izations retain some of the argument/adjunct
structure of the verbal predicate. This is ver-
ified in the corpus since we find many parallel

structures involving appeal both as a verb and
as a noun, such as:
Vice President Salvador Laurel said
today that an ailing Ferdinand Mar-
cos may not survive the year and
appealed to President Corazon
Aquino to allow her ousted predeces-
sor to die in his homeland.
Mrs. Marcos made a public appeal
to President Corazon Aquino to
allow Marcos to return to his home-
land to die.
Indeed, if we examine a common nominal-
ization transformation, i.e. that of transform-
ing the direct object of a verb into a Norman
genitive of the nominalized form, we find a
great overlap in the lexical arguments&apos;.

The parser&apos;s output allowed us to extract

by appeal. The most common prepositional
phrases found after appeal as a verb began

prepositional phrases following appeal as a
noun are headed by to (321 times), for (253),
in (200), of (134), from (78), on (34), etc.
The correspondence between the most fre-

appeal followed by one these prepositional
phrases (i.e., begun with to, for, and in) con-

parser does not recognize passive patterns involv-
ing by.
Here we used only part of the corpus evidence
that was available. Other patterns of nominal-
izations of appeal, e.g. Saxon genitives like the
criminal&apos;s appeal, may well exist in the corpus.

and Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.999990444444444">
When the same filtering technique is applied
to subcorpora derived for other nominaliza-
tion pairs, we obtain the results given in Fig-
ure 4. For each verb—noun pair all sentences
containing any form of the words were ex-
tracted from the AP corpus. The sentences
were processed as explained in section 3. For
each verbal use, the most frequent preposi-
tional phrases following the verbs were tab-
ulated and the three most frequent preposi-
tions were retained. For example, the most
frequent prepositions beginning prepositional
phrases following verb uses of the lemma of-
fer were for, in and to. These prepositions
were used to select probable nominalizations
by extracting noun uses of the predicates
that were immediately followed by preposi-
tional phrases headed by one of the three most
frequent verbal prepositions. For these ex-
tracted noun phrases, when they were found
in a direct object position, the main verbs
were tabulated which gives the results in Fig-
ure 4.
Some of the results in Figure 4 correspond
to our naive intuitions of collocational sup-
port verbs, such as make an offer. For dis-
cussion, both have and hold appear equally
frequently. But other words show the limita-
tions of this method, we would expect make
a demand where we find meei a demand. In
the same subcorpus, although we find make
a demand 77 times, meet a demand is two-
and-a-half times more common. Could this be
because, in a newswire corpus, meeting a de-
mand is more newsworthy than making one?
If we just look at the cases where demand
is modified by the indefinite article; which
might correspond to the more generic nom-
inalizations one spontaneously creates when
generating examples, we find that in the cor-
pus make a demand occurs slightly more often
than meet a demand, ten times vs. six times,
but this is too rare to use as a criterion.
In other cases, such as with proposal and
assertion we find make and reject with almost
equal frequency, and though make might well
be considered a support verb, it is hard to
accept reject as semantically empty. Though
reject is more a consequence than an antonym
of make a proposal, this raises the question, to
which we have no answer, of whether support
verbs have an equally empty antonym.
A more interesting case is the appearance
of issue for order and warning where we
would expect give. Looking into the corpus
evidence, we find issue a restraining order
46 times, and give any type of order only
16 times. This evidence suggest a limita-
tion of our word-based approach. Multi-word
phrases, such as the nominalized phrase re-
straining order, might take a different support
verb than the simple unqualified word forms,
such as order.

6 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.99997344">
Nominalization is a very productive process.
The proper choice of collocational support
verbs for nominalizations in English is a dif-
ficult task for language learners given the
unpredictability of the semantically emptied
verb that fulfills the syntactic role. Given
a robust parser and large corpus, the sim-
ple technique of extracting the most common
verbs for which the nominalized form is the di-
rect object is not always sufficient, since com-
pletely deverbal concrete noun uses share the
same lexical surface form. Comparing argu-
ment/adjunct structures involving the verbal
uses of the predicate and using the most com-
mon of these structures as filters on the sur-
face forms possibly corresponding to nominal-
izations captures the linguistic fact that nom-
inalizations retain the syntactic structures of
their underlying predicate. When these fil-
ters are applied, the most common supporting
verb in the corpus for the recognized nominal-
ized patterns seems to correspond to native
speakers&apos; intuition of the support verb asso-
ciated with the nominalization.

megabyte corpus of newspaper text from
which was extracted evidence for appeal
and other predicates shows how this auto-
mated procedure can be applied to any verb-
nominalization pair given a large corpus and a
robust parser. Other work in automated sup-
port verb discovery using bilingual dictionar-
ies as a source has been reported in Fontenelle
(1993).
It remains to be seen whether these statis-
tical results are more useful to lexicographers
than their more traditional tools of key-word-
in-context files and T-score measures. Human
experiments would be necessary to demon-
strate this. Another useful test of the re-
sults would be to compare the results given
by this technique against machine-readable
dictionary-derived data.
In conclusion, the interest of this technique
is its general approach to corpus linguistics as
one of multiple passes over the same corpus
material, using results of previous passes to
filter and refine data extracted on subsequent
passes. We believe that this approach, cou-
pled with lexical resources and robust parsers,
offers much promise for the future of corpus
exploitation.

The process of nominalization ejects a verb from its syntactic role into a nominal position.

The result of the process is a list of potential support verbs for the nominalized form of a given predicate. 1 Introduction Nominalization, the transformation of a verbal phrase into a nominal form, is possible in most languages (Comrie and Thompson, 1990). Nominalizations are used for a variety of stylistic reasons: to avoid repetitions of a verb, to avoid awkward intransitive uses of transitive verbs, in technical descriptions where passive is commonly used, etc. Though, as a result of nominalization, the original verb is ejected from its syntactic position, it often retains many of its thematic roles.

Using these surface forms as a filter, we scanned 134 Megabytes of tokenized Associated Press newswire stories from the year 19895. As a result of filtering, 6704 sentences (1 Mbyte of text) were extracted. This text was part-of-speech tagged using the Xerox HMM tagger (Cutting et al., 1992). The lexical entries corresponding to appeal were tagged with the following tags: as a noun (3910 times), as an active or infinitival verb (1417), as a progressive verb (292), and as a past participle (400). This tagged text was then parsed by a low-level dependency parser (Grefenstette, 1994)[Chap 3]. From the output of the dependency parser we extracted all the lexically normalized verbs of which appeal was tagged as a direct object. The most common of these verbs are shown in Figure 2.

Other work in automated support verb discovery using bilingual dictionaries as a source has been reported in Fontenelle (1993). It remains to be seen whether these statistical results are more useful to lexicographers than their more traditional tools of key-wordin-context files and T-score measures. Human experiments would be necessary to demonstrate this. Another useful test of the results would be to compare the results given by this technique against machine-readable dictionary-derived data. In conclusion, the interest of this technique is its general approach to corpus linguistics as one of multiple passes over the same corpus material, using results of previous passes to filter and refine data extracted on subs</context>

For each selected nominalized form, syntactically supporting verb information is extracted from the corpus and then collated, providing the candidates for support verbs. 98 1.1 The Nominalization Cline The phenomenon of nominalization in English happens when a verb is replaced by a noun construction using a gerundive or nominal form of the verb. The original subject and objects of the verb can reappear as Saxon or Norman genitives modifying the nominalized form. Quirk et al. (Quirk et al., 1985) distinguish nominalizations between deverbal and verbal nouns. Examples of these are advice vs. killing. Deverbal nouns are defined as records of the action having taken place rather than as description of the action itself. This accounts for the contrast between their arriving for a month and *their arrival for a month. Deverbal nouns can be replaced by regular count nouns in any context, for example painting as a deverbal noun in Brown&apos;s paintings of his daughter can be replaced by photograph whereas this is not the case with the verbal noun painting in The painting of Brown is as skillful </context>

The dine of nominalization can be seen in the morphological changes&apos; that some predicate undergo as they move from an inflected verb (e.g. destroyed) to non-inflected verbal noun (destroying) to a deverbal noun (destruction). In this article we shall consider only deverbal nouns2 since these are the nominalizations involving the collocational phenomena of support verbs. A remaining problem with the deverbal nouns is that the meaning of such nouns can become concretized over time, by a 1The morphological processes involved in transforming verbs into nominalizations are described in (Quirk et al., 1985), Sections 1.43 (conversion) and 1.30 (suffixation). See also 17.52 for discussion of this dine. 20n a practical level, we will also accept as deverbal nouns those forms ending in -ing which are marked as nouns in our lexicon, e.g. warning. metonymic association. Compare the uses of proposal in : He made his formal proposal to the full committee. He put the proposal in the drawer. The concrete uses of deverbal nouns are not involved in support verb constructions since they have lost the semantics of actions, and their attending thematic roles. 2 A very simple approach and its problems Looking </context>

Since real nominalizations are those that still have verbal character, i.e. they have retained the semantic roles from the verb, we will try to recognize true nominalized uses by comparing the most frequent argument/adjunct structures found in the corpus around verbal uses of a given predicate to those syntactic structures found around the candidate nominalized forms&apos;. We will define true nominalizations as those which have a parallel syntactic structure to the original verb. This is also in keeping with the definition of nominalizations given in (Quirk et al., 1985)[p. 1284 A noun phrase ... which has a systematic correspondence with a clause structure will be termed a 3Since these argument/adjunct structures are difficult to recognize precisely without an elaborate parser incorporating semantic analysis, we decided to identify heuristically the structures fulfilling these roles, for example, taking the most frequently occurring prepositional phrases after verbal sequences as adjuncts or arguments. 99 Nominalization.
