<bodyText confidence="0.999898444444444">
Hindi-Punjabi being closely related language
pair (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2008) , Hybrid
Machine Translation approach has been used
for developing Hindi to Punjabi Machine
Translation System. Non-availability of lexical
resources, spelling variations in the source
language text, source text ambiguous words,
named entity recognition and collocations are
the major challenges faced while developing
this syetm. The key activities involved during
translation process are preprocessing,
translation engine and post processing. Lookup
algorithms, pattern matching algorithms etc
formed the basis for solving these issues. The
system accuracy has been evaluated using
intelligibility test, accuracy test and BLEU
score. The hybrid syatem is found to perform
better than the constituent systems.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999808">
Machine Translation system is a software
designed that essentially takes a text in one
language (called the source language), and
translates it into another language (called the
target language). There are number of
approaches for MT like Direct based,
Transform based, Interlingua based, Statistical
etc. But the choice of approach depends upon
the available resources and the kind of
languages involved. In general, if the two
languages are structurally similar, in particular
as regards lexical correspondences,
morphology and word order, the case for
abstract syntactic analysis seems less
convincing. Since the present research work
deals with a pair of closely related language
i.e. Hindi-Punjabi , thus direct word-to-word
translation approach is the obvious choice. As
some rule based approach has also been used,
thus, Hybrid approach has been adopted for
developing the system. An exhaustive survey
has already been given for existing machine
translations systems developed so far
mentioning their accuracies and limitations.
(Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2009).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993918">
2.1 Pre Processing Phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949428571429">
The preprocessing stage is a collection of
operations that are applied on input data to
make it processable by the translation engine.
In the first phase of Machine Translation
system, various activities incorporated include
text normalization, replacing collocations and
replacing proper nouns.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989188">
2.2 Text Normalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851">
The variety in the alphabet, different dialects
and influence of foreign languages has resulted
in spelling variations of the same word. Such
variations sometimes can be treated as errors in
writing. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2010).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999513">
2.3 Replacing Collocations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903266666667">
After passing the input text through text
normalization, the text passes through this
Collocation replacement sub phase of Pre-
processing phase. Collocation is two or more
consecutive words with a special behavior.
(Choueka :1988). For example, the collocation
उᱫर ᮧदेश (uttar pradēsh) if translated word to
word, will be translated as ਜਵਾਬ ਰਾਜ (javāb rāj)
but it must be translated as ਉ᷀ਤਰ ਪᴆਦੇਸ਼ (uttar
pradēsh). The accuracy of the results for
collocation extraction using t-test is not
accurate and includes number of such bigrams
and trigrams that are not actually collocations.
Thus, manually such entries were removed and
actual collocations were further extracted. The

correct corresponding Punjabi translation for
each extracted collocation is stored in the
collocation table of the database. The
collocation table of the database consists of
5000 such entries. In this sub phase, the
normalized input text is analyzed. Each
collocation in the database found in the input
text will be replaced with the Punjabi
translation of the corresponding collocation. It
is found that when tested on a corpus
containing about 1,00,000 words, only 0.001%
collocations were found and replaced during
the translation.

2.4 Replacing Proper Nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977533333334">
A great proposition of unseen words includes
proper nouns like personal, days of month,
days of week, country names, city names, bank
names, organization names, ocean names, river
names, university names etc. and if translated
word to word, their meaning is changed. If the
meaning is not affected, even though this step
fastens the translation process. Once these
words are recognized and stored into the
proper noun database, there is no need to
decide about their translation or transliteration
every time in the case of presence of such
words in input text for translation. This
gazetteer makes the translation accurate and
fast. This list is self growing during each
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999871875">
translation. Thus, to process this sub phase, the
system requires a proper noun gazetteer that
has been complied offline. For this task, we
have developed an offline module to extract
proper nouns from the corpus based on some
rules. Also, Named Entity recognition module
has been developed based on the CRF
approach (Sharma R. and Goyal V., 2011b).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.953691">
2.5 Tokenizer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987166666667">
Tokenizers (also known as lexical analyzers or
word segmenters) segment a stream of
characters into meaningful units called tokens.
The tokenizer takes the text generated by pre
processing phase as input. Individual words or
tokens are extracted and processed to generate
its equivalent in the target language. This
module, using space, a punctuation mark, as
delimiter, extracts tokens (word) one by one
from the text and gives it to translation engine
for analysis till the complete input text is read
and processed.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996564">
2.6 Translation Engine
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997775">
The translation engine is the main component
of our Machine Translation system. It takes
token generated by the tokenizer as input and
outputs the translated token in the target
language. These translated tokens are
concatenated one after another along with the
delimiter. Modules included in this phase are
explained below one by one.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.956592">
2.6.1 Identifying Titles and Surnames
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995229782608696">
Title may be defined as a formal appellation
attached to the name of a person or family by
virtue of office, rank, hereditary privilege,
noble birth, or attainment or used as a mark of
respect. Thus word next to title and word
previous to surname is usually a proper noun.
And sometimes, a word used as proper name
of a person has its own meaning in target
language. Similarly, Surname may be defined
as a name shared in common to identify the
members of a family, as distinguished from
each member&apos;s given name. It is also called
family name or last name. When either title or
surname is passed through the translation
engine, it is translated by the system. This
cause the system failure as these proper names
should be transliterated instead of translation.
For example consider the Hindi sentence
᮰ीमान हषᭅ जी हमारे यहाँ पधारे। (shraman harsh ja
hamare yaham padhare). In this sentence, हषᭅ
(harsh) has the meaning “joy”. The equivalent
translation of हषᭅ (harsh) in target language is
ਖੁਸ਼ੀ (khusha). Similarly, consider the Hindi
sentence ᮧकाश ᳲसह हमारे यहाँ पधारे।. (prakash
simh hamare yaham padhare). Here, ᮧकाश
(prakash) word is acting as proper noun and it
must be transliterated and not translated
because ᳲसह (simh) is surname and word
previous to it is proper noun.
Thus, a small module has been developed for
locating such proper nouns to consider them as
title or surname. There is one special character
‘॰’ in Devanagari script to mark the symbols
like डा॰, ᮧो॰. If this module found this symbol
to be title or surname, the word next and
previous to this token as the case may be for
title or surname respectively, will be
transliterated not translated. The title and
surname database consists of 14 and 654
entries respectively. These databases can be
extended at any time to allow new titles and
surnames to be added. This module was tested
on a large Hindi corpus and showed that about
2-5 % text of the input text depending upon its
domain is proper noun. Thus, this module
plays an important role in translation.

2.6.2 Hindi Morphological analyzer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999474">
This module finds the root word for the token
and its morphological features.Morphological
analyzer developed by IIT-H has been ported
for Windows platform for making it usable for
this system. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S.,2008a)

2.6.3 Word-to-Word translation using
lexicon lookup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998818">
If token is not a title or a surname, it is looked
up in the HPDictionary database containing
Hindi to Punjabi direct word to word
translation. If it is found, it is used for
translation. If no entry is found in
HPDictionary database, it is sent to next sub
phase for processing. The HPDictionary
database consists of 54,127 entries.This
database can be extended at any time to allow
new entries in the dictionary to be added.

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9929279375">
Among number of approaches for
disambiguation, the most appropriate approach
to determine the correct meaning of a Hindi
word in a particular usage for our Machine
Translation system is to examine its context
using N-gram approach. After analyzing the
past experiences of various authors, we have
chosen the value of n to be 3 and 2 i.e. trigram
and bigram approaches respectively for our
system. Trigrams are further categorized into
three different types. First category of trigram
consists of context one word previous to and
one word next to the ambiguous word. Second
category of trigram consists of context of two
adjacent previous words to the ambiguous
word. Third category of the trigram consists of
context of two adjacent next words to the
ambiguous word. Bigrams are also categorized
into two categories. First category of the
bigrams consists of context of one previous
word to ambiguous word and second category
of the bigrams consists of one context word
next to ambiguous word. For this purpose, the
Hindi corpus consisting of about 2 million
words was collected from different sources
like online newspaper daily news, blogs, Prem
Chand stories, Yashwant jain stories, articles
etc. The most common list of ambiguous
words was found. We have found a list of 75
ambiguous words out of which the most
frequent are -4 sē and *T aur. (Goyal V. and
Lehal G.S., 2011)

2.6.5 Handling Unknown Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99560996969697">
2.6.5.1 Word Inflectional Analysis and
generation
In linguistics, a suffix (also sometimes called a
postfix or ending) is an affix which is placed
after the stem of a word. Common examples
are case endings, which indicate the
grammatical case of nouns or adjectives, and
verb endings. Hindi is a (relatively) free word-
order and highly inflectional language.
Because of same origin, both languages have
very similar structure and grammar. The
difference is only in words and in
pronunciation e.g. in Hindi it is TT and in
Punjabi the word for boy is NST and even
sometimes that is also not there like &apos;RT (ghar)
and Wd (ghar). The inflection forms of both
these words in Hindi and Punjabi are also
similar. In this activity, inflectional analysis
without using morphology has been performed
for all those tokens that are not processed by
morphological analysis module. Thus, for
performing inflectional analysis, rule based
approach has been followed. When the token is
passed to this sub phase for inflectional
analysis, If any pattern of the regular
expression (inflection rule) matches with this
token, that rule is applied on the token and its
equivalent translation in Punjabi is generated
based on the matched rule(s). There is also a
check on the generated word for its
correctness. We are using correct Punjabi
words database for testing the correctness of
the generated word.

2.6.5.2 Transliteration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999586833333333">
This module is beneficial for handling out-of-
vocabulary words. For example the word
fkRT cls (vishāl) is transliterated as f�ffATFS
(vishāl) whereas translated as �T. There must
be some method in every Machine Translation
system for words like technical terms and
proper names of persons, places, objects etc.
that cannot be found in translation resources
such as Hindi-Punjabi bilingual dictionary,
surnames database, titles database etc and
transliteration is an obvious choice for such
words. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2009a).

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979333333333">
In spite of the great similarity between Hindi
and Punjabi, there are still a number of
important agreement divergences in gender
and number. The output generated by the
translation engine phase becomes the input for
post-processing phase. This phase will correct
the agreement errors based on the rules
implemented in the form of regular
expressions. (Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2011)

For our Machine Translation system
evaluation, we have used benchmark sampling
method for selecting the set of sentences. Input
sentences are selected from randomly selected
news (sports, politics, world, regional,
entertainment, travel etc.), articles (published
by various writers, philosophers etc.), literature
(stories by Prem Chand, Yashwant jain etc.),
Official language for office letters (The
Language Officially used on the files in
Government offices) and blogs (Posted by
general public in forums etc.). Care has been
taken to ensure that sentences use a variety of
constructs. All possible constructs including
simple as well as complex ones are
incorporated in the set. The sentence set also
contains all types of sentences such as
declarative, interrogative, imperative and
exclamatory. Sentence length is not restricted
although care has been taken that single
sentences do not become too long. Following
table shows the test data set:

<bodyText confidence="0.99997348">
It is also important to choose appropriate
evaluators for our experiments. Thus,
depending upon the requirements and need of
the above mentioned tests, 50 People of
different professions were selected for
performing experiments. 20 Persons were from
villages that only knew Punjabi and did not
know Hindi and 30 persons were from
different professions having knowledge of both
Hindi and Punjabi. Average ratings for the
sentences of the individual translations were
then summed up (separately according to
intelligibility and accuracy) to get the average
scores. Percentage of accurate sentences and
intelligent sentences was also calculated
separately by counting the number of
sentences.
The evaluators do not have any clue about the
source language i.e. Hindi. They judge each
sentence (in target language i.e. Punjabi) on
the basis of its comprehensibility. The target
user is a layman who is interested only in the
comprehensibility of translations. Intelligibility
is effected by grammatical errors, mis-
translations, and un-translated words.
