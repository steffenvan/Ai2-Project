We increase the lexical coverage of
FrameNet through automatic paraphras-
ing. We use crowdsourcing to manually
filter out bad paraphrases in order to en-
sure a high-precision resource. Our ex-
panded FrameNet contains an additional
22K lexical units, a 3-fold increase over
the current FrameNet, and achieves 40%
better coverage when evaluated in a prac-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871769230769">
Frame semantics describes a word in relation to
real-world events, entities, and activities. Frame
semantic analysis can improve natural language
understanding (Fillmore and Baker, 2001), and
has been applied to tasks like question answering
(Shen and Lapata, 2007) and recognizing textual
entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006; Aharon
et al., 2010). FrameNet (Fillmore, 1982; Baker
et al., 1998) is a widely-used lexical-semantic re-
source embodying frame semantics. It contains
close to 1,000 manually defined frames, i.e. rep-
resentations of concepts and their semantic prop-
erties, covering a wide array of concepts from Ex-
pensiveness to Obviousness.
Frames in FrameNet are characterized by a set
of semantic roles and a set of lexical units (LUs),
which are word/POS pairs that “evoke” the frame.
For example, the following sentence contains a
mention (i.e. target) of the Obviousness frame: In
late July, it was barely visible to the unaided eye.
This particular target instantiates several semantic
roles of the Obviousness frame, including a Phe-
nomenon (it) and a Perceiver (the unaided eye).
Here, the LU visible.a evokes the frame. In
total, the Obviousness frame has 13 LUs including
clarity.n, obvious.a, and show.v.

to the new FrameNet+. New LUs (bold) have been added us-
ing the method of paraphrasing and human-vetting described
in Section 4.
The semantic information in FrameNet (FN)
is broadly useful for problems such as entail-
ment (Ellsworth and Janin, 2007; Aharon et al.,
2010) and knowledge base population (Mohit and
Narayanan, 2003; Christensen et al., 2010; Gre-
gory et al., 2011), and is of general enough inter-
est to language understanding that substantial ef-
fort has focused on building parsers to map nat-
ural language onto FrameNet frames (Gildea and
Jurafsky, 2002; Das and Smith, 2012). In practice,
however, FrameNet’s usefulness is limited by its
size. FN was built entirely manually by linguistic
experts. As a result, despite many years of work,
most of the words that one confronts in naturally
occurring text do not appear at all in FN. For ex-
ample, the word blatant is likely to evoke the Ob-
viousness frame, but is not present in FN’s list of
LUs (Table 1). In fact, out of the targets we sample
in this work (described in Section 4), fewer than
50% could be mapped to a correct frame using the
LUs in FrameNet. This finding is consistent with
what has been reported by Palmer and Sporleder
(2010). Such low lexical coverage prevents FN
from applying to many real-world applications.

In this work, we triple the lexical coverage of
FrameNet quickly and with high precision. We
do this in two stages: 1) we use rules from the
Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) to
automatically paraphrase FN sentences and 2) we
apply crowdsourcing to manually verify that the
automatic paraphrases are of high quality. While
prior efforts have entertained the idea of expand-
ing FN’s coverage (Ferr´andez et al., 2010; Das and
Smith, 2012; Fossati et al., 2013), none have re-
sulted in a publicly available resource that can be
easily used. As our main contribution, we release
FrameNet+, a huge, manually-vetted extension to
the current FrameNet. FrameNet+ provides over
22,000 new frame/LU mappings in a format that
can be readily incorporated into existing systems.
We demonstrate that the expanded resource pro-
vides a 40% improvement in lexical coverage in a
practical setting.

2 Expanding FrameNet Automatically
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952625">
The Paraphrase Database (PPDB) (Ganitkevitch
et al., 2013) is an enormous collection of lexical,
phrasal, and syntactic paraphrases. The database
is released in six sizes (S to XXXL) ranging from
highest precision/lowest recall to lowest average
precision/highest recall. We focus on lexical (sin-
gle word) paraphrases from the XL distribution, of
which there are over 370K.
Our aim is to increase the type-level coverage
of FN. We use the rules in PPDB along with
a 5-gram Kneser-Ney smoothed language model
(Heafield et al., 2013) to paraphrase FN’s full
frame-annotated sentences (called fulltext). We ig-
nore paraphrase rules which are redundant with
LUs already covered by FN. This method for auto-
matic paraphrasing has been discussed previously
by Rastogi and Van Durme (2014). However,
whereas their work only discussed the idea as a
hypothetical way of augmenting FN, we apply the
method, vet the results, and release it as a public
resource.
In total, we generate 188,061 paraphrased sen-
tences, covering 686 frames. Table 2 shows some
of the paraphrases produced.

<bodyText confidence="0.975828">
Our automatic process produces a large number of
good paraphrases, but does not address issues like
word sense, and many of the paraphrased LUs al-
ter the sentence so that it no longer evokes the in-
tended frame. For example, PPDB proposes free
as a paraphrase of open. This is a good paraphrase
in the Secrecy status frame but does not hold for
the Openness frame (Table 3).

We therefore refine the automatic paraphrases
manually to remove paraphrased LUs which do
not evoke the same frame as the original LU. We
show each sentence to three unique workers on
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and ask each
to judge how well the paraphrase retains the mean-
ing of the original phrase. We use the 5-point grad-
ing scale for paraphrase proposed by Callison-
Burch (2008).
To ensure that annotators perform our task con-
scientiously, we embed gold-standard control sen-
tences taken from WordNet synsets. Overall,
workers were 76% accurate on our controls and
showed good levels of agreement– the average
correlation between two annotators’ ratings was ρ
= 0.49.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of Turkers’ rat-
ings for the 188K automatically paraphrased tar-
gets. In 44% of cases, the new LU was judged
to retain the meaning of the original LU given the
frame-specific context. These 85K sentences con-
tain 22K unique frame/LU mappings which we are

<bodyText confidence="0.999750913793104">
We aim to measure the type-level coverage im-
provements provided by our expanded FrameNet
in a practical setting. Ideally, one would like
to identify frames evoked by arbitrary sentences
from natural text. To emulate this setting, we
consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled
from the New York Times. The question we ask
is: does the resource contain an entry associating
this LU with the frame that is actually evoked by
this target?
FrameNet+ We refer to the expanded
FrameNet, which contains the current FN’s
LUs as well as the proposed paraphrased LUs,
as FrameNet+. The size and precision of
FrameNet+ can be tuned by setting a threshold t
and only including LU/frame mappings for which
the average MTurk rating was at least t. Setting
t = 0 includes all paraphrases, even those which
human’s judged to be incorrect, while setting
t &gt; 5 includes no paraphrases, and is equal to the
current FN. Unless otherwise specified, we set
t = 3. This includes all paraphrases which were
judged minimally as “retaining the meaning of the
original.”
Sampling LUs We consider a word to be “po-
tentially frame-evoking” if FN+ (t = 0) contains
some entry for the word, i.e. the word is either an
LU in the current FN or appears in PPDB-XL as
a paraphrase of some LU in the current FN. We
sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types
from the New York Times: 100 each nouns, verbs,
and adjectives. We take a stratified sample: within
each POS, types are divided into buckets based
on their frequency, and we sample uniformly from
each bucket.
Annotation For each of the potentially frame-
evoking words in our sample, we have expert (non-
MTurk) annotators determine the frame evoked.
The annotator is given the candidate LU in the
context of the NYT sentence in which it occurred,
and is shown the list of frames which are poten-
tially evoked by this LU according to FrameNet+.
The annotator then chooses which of the proposed
frames fits the target, or determines that none do.
We measure agreement by having two experts la-
bel each target. On average, agreement was good
(κ=0.56). In cases where they disagreed, the an-
notators discussed and came to a final consensus.
Results We compute the coverage of a resource
as the percent of targets for which the resource
contained a correct LU/frame mapping. Figure
2 shows the coverage computed for the current
FN compared to FN+. By including the human-
vetted paraphrases, FN+ is able to return a cor-
rect LU/frame mapping for 60% of the targets in
our sample, 40% more targets than were covered
by the current FN. Table 4 shows some sentences
covered by FN+ that are missed by the current FN.

6 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999015821428571">
Several efforts have worked on expanding FN cov-
erage. Most approaches align FrameNet’s LUs to
WordNet or other lexical resources (Shi and Mi-
halcea, 2005; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Pen-
nacchiotti et al., 2008; Ferr´andez et al., 2010).
Das and Smith (2011) and Das and Smith
(2012) used graph based semi-supervised meth-
ods to improve frame coverage and Hermann et al.
(2014) used word and frame embeddings to im-
prove generalization. All of these improvements
are restricted to their respective tool rather than
a general-use resource. In principle one of these
tools could be used to annotate a large corpus in
search of new LUs, but their precision on unseen
predicates/LUs (our focus here) is still below 50%,
considerably lower than this work.
Fossati et al. (2013) added new frames to FN by
collecting full frame annotations through crowd-
sourcing, a more complicated task that again did
not result in a useable resource. Buzek et al.
(2010) applied crowdsourced paraphrasing to ex-
pand training data for machine translation. Our
approach differs in that we expand the number of
LUs directly using automatic paraphrasing and use
crowdsourcing to verify that the new LUs are cor-
rect. We apply our method in full, resulting in a
large resource can be easily incorporated into ex-
isting systems.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937492933333333">
We have applied automatic paraphrasing to
greatly increase the type-level lexical coverage of
FrameNet, a widely used resource embodying the
theory of frame semantics. We use crowdsourc-
ing to manually verify that the newly added lex-
ical units are correct, resulting in FrameNet+, a
high-precision resource that is three times as large
as the existing resource. We demonstrate that in a
practical setting, the expanded resource provides a
40% increase in the number of sentences for which
FN is able to identify the correct frame. The data
released will improve the applicability of FN to
end-use applications with diverse vocabularies.

Frame semantic analysis can improve natural language understanding (Fillmore and Baker, 2001), and has been applied to tasks like question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) and recognizing textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006; Aharon et al., 2010). FrameNet (Fillmore, 1982; Baker et al., 1998) is a widely-used lexical-semantic resource embodying frame semantics. It contains close to 1,000 manually defined frames, i.e. representations of concepts and their semantic properties, covering a wide array of concepts from Expensiveness to Obviousness. Frames in FrameNet are characterized by a set of semantic roles and a set of lexical units (LUs), which are word/POS pairs that “evoke” the frame.

The database is released in six sizes (S to XXXL) ranging from highest precision/lowest recall to lowest average precision/highest recall. We focus on lexical (single word) paraphrases from the XL distribution, of which there are over 370K. Our aim is to increase the type-level coverage of FN. We use the rules in PPDB along with a 5-gram Kneser-Ney smoothed language model (Heafield et al., 2013) to paraphrase FN’s full frame-annotated sentences (called fulltext). We ignore paraphrase rules which are redundant with LUs already covered by FN. This method for automatic paraphrasing has been discussed previously by Rastogi and Van Durme (2014). However, whereas their work only discussed the idea as a hypothetical way of augmenting FN, we apply the method, vet the results, and release it as a public resource. In total, we generate 188,061 paraphrased sentences, covering 686 frames. Table 2 shows some of the paraphrases produced. 3 Manual Refining with Crowdsourcing Our automatic process p</context>

FN was built entirely manually by linguistic experts. As a result, despite many years of work, most of the words that one confronts in naturally occurring text do not appear at all in FN. For example, the word blatant is likely to evoke the Obviousness frame, but is not present in FN’s list of LUs (Table 1). In fact, out of the targets we sample in this work (described in Section 4), fewer than 50% could be mapped to a correct frame using the LUs in FrameNet. This finding is consistent with what has been reported by Palmer and Sporleder (2010). Such low lexical coverage prevents FN from applying to many real-world applications. 408 Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Short Papers), pages 408–413, Beijing, China, July 26-31, 2015. c�2015 Association for Computational Linguistics Frame Original Paraphrase Frame-annotated sentence Quantity amount figure It is not clear if this figure includes the munitions...

We use crowdsourcing to manually filter out bad paraphrases in order to ensure a high-precision resource. Our expanded FrameNet contains an additional 22K lexical units, a 3-fold increase over the current FrameNet, and achieves 40% better coverage when evaluated in a practical setting on New York Times data. 1 Introduction Frame semantics describes a word in relation to real-world events, entities, and activities. Frame semantic analysis can improve natural language understanding (Fillmore and Baker, 2001), and has been applied to tasks like question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) and recognizing textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006; Aharon et al., 2010). FrameNet (Fillmore, 1982; Baker et al., 1998) is a widely-used lexical-semantic resource embodying frame semantics. It contains close to 1,000 manually defined frames, i.e. representations of concepts and their semantic properties, covering a wide array of concepts from Expensiveness to Obviousness. Frames in FrameNet are characterized by a set of semantic roles and a set of lexical units (LUs), which are word/POS pairs that “evoke” the frame. For example, the following sentence contains a mention (i.e. targe</context>
