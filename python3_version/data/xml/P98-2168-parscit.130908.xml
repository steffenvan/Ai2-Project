<bodyText confidence="0.9995670625">
The view that communication is a form of action
serving a variety of specific functions has had a
tremendous impact on the philosophy of language
and on computational linguistics. Yet, this mode
of analysis has been applied to only a narrow range
of exchanges (e.g. those whose primary purpose is
transferring information or coordinating tasks) while
exchanges meant to manage interpersonal relation-
ships, maintain &amp;quot;face&amp;quot;, or simply to convey thanks,
sympathy, and so on have been largely ignored. We
present a model of such &amp;quot;social perlocutions&amp;quot; that
integrates previous work in natural language gener-
ation, social psychology, and communication studies.
This model has been implemented in a system that
generates socially appropriate e-mail in response to
user-specified communicative goals.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9996236">
The importance of viewing utterances as not simply
statements of fact but also as real actions (speech
acts) with consequences has long been well under-
stood (Searle, 1969; Austin 1975; Grice 1975). As a
result, it is important to study not just the formal
aspects of language forms but also how speakers use
different forms to serve different functions. For ex-
ample, one function of the act of informing another
person is to make the person aware of a state of af-
fairs; similarly, one function of promising is to secure
the return of a favor.
Unfortunately, the study of speech acts has been
largely limited to the collection and classification of
act types and the conditions for appropriate use of
each type (Searle 1969; Wiersbicka 1987). The range
of functions, or perlocutionary effects, served by dif-
ferent act types has been largely ignored. In partic-
ular, there has been little or no work on the impact
that speech acts can have on social attitudes and
behavior. Yet, without an account of how commu-

nication can affect social situations, it is impossible
to construct systems that are capable of generating
socially appropriate text.
This paper provides a computational model of
social perlocutions, and it describes how this model
has been used to construct an automated system,
LetterGen, for generating socially appropriate e-mail
messages and letters. This system takes general
communicative and social goals from the user, such
as demanding action or expressing congratulations,
queries the user about subgoals and pertinent back-
ground information, and generates the text of an
appropriate message by planning individual speech
acts.
As an example, Figure 1 shows a message gener-
ated by LetterGen in response to an input goal to
decline an invitation politely. In this example, the
writer was invited by the addressee to travel and give
a talk, but the writer had a previous commitment
and must decline. However, the writer knows some-

one who could give the talk in his place. The system
planned a set of speech acts and realized each as a
clause or phrase using a text template library. These
acts include (1) thanking, (2) declining-request, (3)
apologizing, (4) making-excuse, (5) advising, (6) as-
suring, and (7) requesting.
Most of the text in the letter is devoted to ad-
dressing the writer&apos;s social goals of being polite and
helpful. In contrast, a letter writer concerned only
with informing the addresee that he was not partic-
ipating would likely say little other than 9 won&apos;t be
giving a talk at your event&amp;quot;, a socially inappropriate
response.

2 Previous Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998677166666667">
Our work builds on results from three disparate ar-
eas: natural language generation (NLG), communi-
cation studies, and social psychology.
The NLG community has focused on a small sub-
set of the five generally accepted categories of speech
acts (Levinson, 1983):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977832933333333">
1. Representatives—statements given as true de-
pictions of the world (e.g., asserting, conclud-
ing).
2. Directives—statements attempting to per-
suade the hearer to do something (e.g., order-
ing, advising, warning).
3. Commissives—statements that commit the
speaker to a course of action (e.g., promising,
accepting a request, taking a side).
4. Expressives—statements expressing a psycho-
logical state (e.g., apologizing, congratulating,
condoling).
5. Declarations—statements effecting an immedi-
ate change in the institutional state of affairs
(e.g., christening, firing from employment).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969622222223">
In particular, research in NLG has been limited
to one type of representative (i.e., informing) and
one type of directive (i.e., requesting), and it has
further focused on informing&apos;s potential to convince
the hearer of some fact and requesting&apos;s potential to
persuade the hearer to do some action (Allen et al.,
1994; Appelt, 1985; Bruce, 1975; Cohen and Per-
rault, 1979; Hovy, 1988; Perrault and Allen, 1979).
As a result, it has largely ignored speech acts in other
categories, such as promising, advising, and credit-
ing, as well as their potential perlocutionary effects
of creating affinity between speaker and hearer, se-
curing future favors for the speaker, and so on.
In contrast, research in communication stud-
ies has explored strategies for persuading, creating
affinity, comforting, and many other interpersonal
goals (Daly and Wiemann, 1994; Marcu, 1997). For
example, the strategies for persuading include not
only requesting, but also exchange, ingratiation, and
sanctions. However, these efforts have not analyzed
these strategies in terms of speech act types and per-
locutionary effects so that these strategies might be
realized in computational form.
Finally, research in social psychology has looked
at how personality traits affect interpersonal interac-
tion. For example, Kiesler (1983) formulated general
rules for describing how one person expressing one
trait (e.g., merciful) can lead to another person ex-
pressing a symmetric and complementary trait (e.g.,
appreciative). Such interaction dyads are directly
mappable to the speaker/hearer dyad of speech act
theory, and the vocabulary of trait terms and pre-
dictive rules suggest one way of lending organization
to the great variety of perlocutionary effects. Yet,
social psychologists have not mapped their general
trait terms to the classes of speech acts that might
express these traits.
What&apos;s been lacking is an attempt to integrate
the lessons learned from these different research ef-
forts to provide an initial model of social perlocu-
tions; that is, a model that describes how specific
speech act types have the potential to produce spe-
cific effects in a hearer corresponding to a speaker&apos;s
social goals, and that is specified formally enough to
be used as part of text generation systems.

3 Our Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996272">
There are two key questions to address in forming a
computational model of social perlocutions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996172">
• What are the possible socially-relevant effects
of speech acts?
• What are the relationships between different
effects?

3.1 Social Perlo cutionary Effects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917428571429">
We have developed a taxonomy of social perlocution-
ary effects of speech acts. These effects are defined
in terms of mental attitudes of the hearer, following
the assumption in speech act theory that all perlocu-
tionary effects follow from the hearer&apos;s recognition of
the speaker&apos;s communicative intent. The taxonomy
is:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.954557">
1021
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.979303333333333">
1. Beliefs about speaker&apos;s precise communicative
content and communicative intent.
2. Beliefs about the speaker&apos;s intent to benefit or
harm the hearer.
3. Beliefs about the hearer&apos;s or speaker&apos;s respon-
sibilities (ascribed or undertaken).
4. Beliefs about (or, impressions of) the speaker&apos;s
personality traits.
5. The hearer&apos;s emotions.
6. The relationship between the hearer and the
speaker.
7. The hearer&apos;s goals.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959625">
We developed this taxonomy by reviewing the
communications studies and social psychology litera-
ture, as well as by analysing a corpus of letters and e-
mail messages for their speech acts and most promi-
nent social effects. Prior research on speech acts has
largely ignored several of these categories, especially
the effects on personality impressions, emotions, and
the speaker-hearer relationship.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989794">
3.2 Relationship Between Social Ef-
fects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999244">
This taxonomy is important because there appear
to be significant restrictions on the relationships be-
tween these different classes of effects.
Figure 2 shows how these different types of effects
are related. The arrows represent potential causal
links between effects. These links are potential be-
cause there are specific conditions associated with
specific effects that dictate whether one effect will
cause another.
Essentially, the effects start with the hearer&apos;s
recognition and acceptance of a message&apos;s content
and culminates in changes to hearer goals and the re-
lationship between the hearer and the speaker. That
is, a speech act directly results in beliefs about the
content and intent of utterances and these beliefs
indirectly result in changes to goals, emotions, and
interpersonal relationships. Specficially, these belief
can lead to indirect changes in the hearer&apos;s belief
about the speaker&apos;s intent to benefit or harm the
hearer, as well as changes to the hearer&apos;s responsibil-
ities that involve the speaker. In turn, changes in be-
lief about whether the speaker intends to benefit or
harm the header can lead to changes in the hearer&apos;s
goals, the hearer&apos;s emotions, and the hearer&apos;s im-
pressions of the speaker&apos;s personality traits. Finally,
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.959967">
Figure 2: The Relationships Between Social Effects
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999685166666667">
changes to the hearer&apos;s emotions can lead to changes
in the hearer&apos;s relationship with the speaker.
Our hypothesis is that Figure 2 provides a frame-
work into all speech acts with social effects can be
mapped. To test this hypothesis, we analysed in de-
tail the relationship between the effects of 40 differ-
ent types of speech acts, and we successfully placed
each into this framework (Pautler, 1999). These
speech acts were typical of the letters and messages
we collected, and they were representative of four of
the five main categories of speech acts.&apos;
Figure 3 is an example, showing these effects for
apologizing.a Although not shown in Figure 3, the
causal relationships between these effects have con-
ditions attached to them. In Figure 3, for example, a
condition on an apology leading to the hearer believ-
ing the speaker feels regret is that the hearer believes
the speaker is sincere and there is an act for which

focus on acts used in casual, interpersonal interactions rather
than acts that were institutionally framed.

than adult Westerners. See Barnlund (1989) for comparisons
on the use of different speech acts by Americans and Japanese.

an apology is appropriate.
We draw our terminology for describing specific
personality traits (e.g., likeable, conscientious) and
emotions (e.g., gratitude, liking) from existing tax-
onomies (Kiesler, 1983; Ortony et al., 1988).
Figure 3 shows effects with arrows leading to
them from other speech acts, such as praising, warn-
ing, thanking, and so on. These speech acts are there
to illustrate that speech acts are related through a
web of interlocking effects. That is, the causal rela-
tionships between speech acts and effects is many-
to-many: a single act can have many different effects
and any single effect can be brought about by many
different acts. For example, expressing a demand
can bring about compliance, anger, or both, and
similarly, anger can be caused by a variety of other
acts, such as issuing a threat. In Figure 3, both
praising and apologising are examples of acts that
can increase the hearer&apos;s liking for the speaker, and
both apologising and thanking can lead the hearer
to believe the speaker is accountable.
This large web of relationships between the ef-
fects of social speech acts leads to the question: How
can we efficiently generate the speech acts we need
to achieve an appropriate emotional response in the
hearer?

4 A Model Of Letter Genera-
tion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983466666667">
To illustrate the power of our model of social per-
locution, we have applied it to the task of e-mail
generation in a system called LetterGen. The sys-
tem&apos;s primary task is to take a high-level commu-
nicative goal (e.g., inform a colleague that one can&apos;t
attend a meeting) and suggest a set of speech acts
to achieve that goal. However, once it has made this
suggestion, the system then interact with the user
to determine which speech acts will appear in the
final message and to acquire any additional back-
ground information needed to instantiate sentence
text templates associated with each speech act.
In addition to the user&apos;s explicit input goal, the
system works with a set of &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; user goals.
These goals fall into three classes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9962475">
1. Cost avoidance—avoiding undesired aspects of
a current or incipient situation, such as un-
wanted social perceptions of oneself.
2. Status-quo maintenance—selection of an act
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.775456545454546">
because one of its effects would reinforce a de-
sired aspect of the current situation (e..g, of-
fering to help another person because it would
reinforce one&apos;s self-image as a generous per-
son).
3. Trait-based habit—performing of an act as a
timeworn expression of a personality trait.
These goals can be thought as a stereotypical model
of the user (Chin, 1989). These goals are achieved
opportunistically during the process of determining
speech acts for the explicitly provided user goal.

LetterGen essentially represents the perlocutionary
effects of speech acts as a large graph. Figure 4 il-
lustrates a portion of this representation that relates
the speech acts of declining, thanking, and apologis-
ing. The nodes of the graph represent various effects,
and the unlabled edges represent a causal relation-
ships between two effects. There are also constraints

not shown in this figure). Finally, there are mitigates
links between nodes when two effects are contradic-
tory.
A reasonable view of LetterGen&apos;s approach is
that there is a script associated with each speech act
that captures the causal chain of effects that poten-
tially follow from it. While these effects could pre-
sumably be determined by reasoning from first prin-
ciples, these scripts can be viewed as standard meth-
ods of achieving communicative goals, and they are
essentially equivalent to the communicative strate-
gies proposed by others (Marco, 1997).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.947988">
4.2 Determining Appropriate Speech
Acts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999409">
LetterGen&apos;s algorithm for producing a response in-
volves 5 steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.847082222222222">
1. Metch the user&apos;s goal to one of the nodes (ef-
fects) in the graph.
2. From the matching effect, traverse graph links
&amp;quot;downward&amp;quot; toward the speech act, checking
the conditions on each link.
3. For every path that reaches an act by satisfy-
ing all conditions along the path, add the act
to the new message by instantiating the act&apos;s
text template.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991288">
ward&amp;quot; as far as possible.
5. If an effect is indexed by a mitigates link, fol-
low the link to the mitigating effect in the
other chain. Continue with steps 2 and 3.
As an example, consider the user&apos;s communica-
tive goal to make the hearer believe that the speaker
will not attend. Lettergen traverses the graph down-
wards to locate the speech act Declining. After de-
termining this speech act, LetterGen then traverses
the graph upward, moving through its effects, veri-
fying that none of them conflict with known speaker
goals. In this case, one of the effects of Declining
conflicts with the speaker&apos;s goal that the hearer be-
Heves the speaker is polite. At this point, LetterGen
generates a new goal to mitigate that effect, and
recursively uses its algorithm to locate speech acts
to achieve that goal. With the failed goal of being
perceived as polite, LetterGen&apos;s downward traver-
sal locates Thanking and Apologizing as appropriate
speech acts to mitigate that failure.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99972">
4.3 An Alternative To Planning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872925925926">
This approach can be viewed as a form of reactive
planning. LetterGen can be viewed as having a
simple goal (communicate a particular belief to the
hearer), forming a plan (finding a set of speech acts
that communicate this belief), analyzing the effects
of the plan (looking for user goals that are violated
by these speech acts), and opportunistically pursu-
ing new goals (to mitigate these violations).
LetterGen differs significantly from most other
efforts in planning speech acts. These efforts explic-
itly represent speech acts and their effects as plan
operators and attempt to synthesize sequences of op-
erators. Unfortunately, as others have pointed out
(Cohen and Levesque, 1980; 1990), plan operators
are not a good representation when acts have long
chains of effects. That&apos;s because each chain that re-
sults from a given act must be conflated to a flat
list of effects, or each effect must be re-envisioned as
an act, with one operator for each effect and appro-
priate preconditions so the operators can form the
appropriate chain.
LetterGen&apos;s approach is most similar to the alter-
native to planning for speech-modeling proposed by
Cohen and Levesque (1980, 1990). Their approach
uses a set of inference rules and act type definitions
and is explicitly designed to capture sequences of
this type,

where A(d) is an act that communicates proposi-
tional content d (definitional content for some act
type), which induces effect El under conditions cl,
which induces effect E2 under conditions c2, and so
on.
This rule formalism is directly mappable to the
conditionalized causal relations used in our social
perlocutions model, with two exceptions. One is
that we capture the rules with an annotated graph
structure that makes the connectivity among rules
explicit (scripts). The other provide a specialized
graph-traversal algorithm that takes advantage of
key properties of the graph, which allows us to sub-
stitute efficient graph traversal for generalised plan-
ning.

5 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964565217392">
The current implementation contains a very detailed
model of speech act effects, containing over 400
effects and constraints. It is able to generate a
dozen different types of messages, including initiat-
ing or terminating a friendship, applying or resign-
ing from a job, congratulating or consoling someone,
accepting or declining an invitation, encouraging or
discouraging someone from doing an act, thanking
someone, and apologizing to someone. Each of these
different message types includes an organizational
template that places generated acts in an appropri-
ate order for the task.
An important part of LetterGen is its interac-
tion with the user. Given a selected message type,
LetterGen suggests at least three speech acts for the
user to choose from. For example, the thanking mes-
sage type (i.e., make them believe you feel gratitude)
can be instantiated crediting (distributing credit),
offering (to repay), as well as an overt expression of
gratitude (i.e., thanking). For each act chosen by
the user, the system queries the user for the back-
ground information needed to instantiate an appro-
priate text template.

6 Limitations and Future
Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999895">
The model currently has three major limitations.
First, it does not cover all aspects of social inter-
actions. For example, it does not have conditions
or effects involving the relative status of the speaker
and hearer, or specialized roles they might play (e.g.,
judge, employer, and so on). Second, the condi-
tions on exactly when effects occur need to be elabo-
rated significantly. Finally, there are socially-related
speech acts we have not yet represented (e.g., ex-
pressing sadness, joy, and so on).
The primary implementation limitation involves
the background information required to determine
whether various conditions hold. Currently, the im-
plementation does not query the user for all the
background information it could take advantage of.
The reason is that too many queries makes the pro-
gram loses its appeal as a work-saving device. A
related limitation is that its model of the speaker&apos;s
goals is static, rather than dynamic (e.g., the speaker
is always assumed to have a goal of being polite). We
are addressing both of these problems by exploring
techniques for forming a detailed user profile and
applying across a large set of generated letters. The
other important limitation is that its organizational
and text templates are not particularly flexible (e.g.,
they demand a specific speech act order and they
realize each speech act as a single sentence). One
way to address this problem is to take the set of
speech acts that LetterGen wants to generate as a
goal and to plan exactly how they will be realized
(Hovy, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1994; Hobbs, 1982).
One interesting area for future exploration is the
problem of applying the model to letter understand-
ing as well as generation. This problem is potentially
difficult, as there are a variety of social reasons why
a particular speech act might have appeared. For ex-
ample, the thanking act might have been included in
the example of Figure 1 in order to lessen the social
debt the invitee owes to the inviter, or to avoid in-
sulting the inviter through curtness, or to make the
invitee feel that he is a polite person, or simply out
of habit.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944866666667">
This paper has presented a computational model
of the social perlocutionary effects of speech acts.
Our model extends previous formal models of speech
acts to take into account effects involving emotions,
impressions, and the interpersonal relationship be-
tween the speaker and the hearer. In doing so,
we have integrated earlier results from natural lan-
guage generation on speech acts, from communica-
tion studies on communication strategies, and from
social psychology on how interactions affect person-
ality traits.
We have used this model to construct a proto-
type program that generates letters that meet social
goals. This task is a key aspect of any general-
purpose, intelligent, personal assistant that is in-

<abstract confidence="0.998817117647059">The view that communication is a form of action serving a variety of specific functions has had a tremendous impact on the philosophy of language and on computational linguistics. Yet, this mode of analysis has been applied to only a narrow range of exchanges (e.g. those whose primary purpose is transferring information or coordinating tasks) while exchanges meant to manage interpersonal relationships, maintain &amp;quot;face&amp;quot;, or simply to convey thanks, sympathy, and so on have been largely ignored. We present a model of such &amp;quot;social perlocutions&amp;quot; that integrates previous work in natural language generation, social psychology, and communication studies. This model has been implemented in a system that generates socially appropriate e-mail in response to user-specified communicative goals.</abstract>
