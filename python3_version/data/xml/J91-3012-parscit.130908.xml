out implications through the study
of quantification for logic, math-

the characterization of logical terms

These essays present case studies in
contemporary comparative gram-
mar, illustrating the rich and varied
ways in which the principles and
parameters framework of generative
grammar can provide explanations
for both the underlying universal
properties of the world&apos;s languages
and the ways in which they differ.
The final essay by Noam Chomsky
offers a new perspective on the
principles and parameters approach
to comparative grammar.

Offering an inquiry into the nature of language from the perspective of computing, this unique
new text synthesizes recent research in linguistics, computer science, and experimental psychol-
ogy as it explores the major computational approaches to language, especially the modeling of
processes by which language is comprehended. Among the topics considered are the
computationally symbolic basis of language, lexicons as repositories of information, automated
text processing, phonology, phototactics, speech synthesis and the persisting challenge of
continuous speech, transformational grammars and their successors, linguistic and conceptual
approaches to sentence meaning, and discourse coherence and plan-based bridging inferences.
The book also explores such up-to-the-minute subjects as neurally-inspired computing, parsing
and psychological plausibility, the controversial representation hypothesis, and the ramifications
of discourse &amp;quot;focus.&amp;quot; With its clear, engaging style and gradual, systematic exposition,
Computers and Human Language makes the fast-moving world of computational linguistics
accessible to the beginning student.

<bodyText confidence="0.996977866666667">
The ACL Series will offer books of high quality in the field of
natural language processing, including human and machine
speech production and understanding. It will cover a wide range
of topics, both theoretical and applied, which should interest
researchers not only in computational linguistics, but also in
formal linguistics.
The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, re-
search monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of
high quality papers with clear unifying themes compiled under
the editorship of distinguished researchers.
The MIT Press publishes the ACL journal, Computational Lin-
guistics. The Press also has a strong list in formal linguistics and
publishes the journal Linguistic Inquiry.
Submissions for the ACL Series should be directed to one of the

William Rounds, Avarind Joshi, Janet Fodor, and

multidisciplinary field of natural language processing.
In four separate essays they address the complex and
difficult connections among grammatical theory,
mathematical linguistics, and the operation of real
natural-language-processing systems, both human and
electronic. The editors&apos; subtantial introduction details
the progress and problems involved in attempts to
relate these four areas of research.

Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are
paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most
ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for
renewals made after 1 March; this fee does not apply to new members. Institutions now subscribe to the journal
through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; (+1-617)253-2889. Back issues and
proceedings are available only from the ACL Office, except that institutions should backorder journals from 1988 on
through MIT Press. An order form is on the other side of this statement. Payments for dues, back issues, and
proceedings can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S.; most Europeans should pay through Europe;
read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify your institutional affiliation if it is not

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976119">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.744136">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971316411764706">
Paper: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for
inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to the Editor:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was .
established in 1982.-Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, and Generation have been formed; others are likely to be added.
