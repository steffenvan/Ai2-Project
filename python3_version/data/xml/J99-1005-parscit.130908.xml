&amp;quot;We open our mouths and out flow words whose ancestries we do not even know. We
are walking lexicons.... We carry a museum inside our heads.... I find this mirac-
ulous. I never cease to wonder at it.&amp;quot; These words of Penelope Lively, appearing in
Jean Aitchison&apos;s The Language Web (Cambridge University Press, 1997), economically
portray our general feelings of awe vis-à-vis language. And now there is this 500-page
volume (HLT hereafter), sponsored by the Directorate General XIII of the European
Union and the Information Science and Engineering Directorate of the NSF, offering
a materialized version of this awe, in the form of an overview of the technology of
human language at the close of the twentieth century. Human language technology
is a multidisciplinary enterprise, unifying methods from computer science, linguis-
tics, electrical engineering, cognitive psychology, etc. Its major goal is to advance the
quality of communication between humans and computers by arming the latter with
proficiency in spoken and written language. HLT is the work of a committee and is
intended as a comprehensive, definitive survey of all the important ingredients of this
strategic field. Unfortunately, in this reviewer&apos;s opinion, it does not wholly succeed in
this endeavor. But the book does not fail badly or dramatically either. What we have
here is a respectable venture which is useful but may fade (should I say &amp;quot;sink&amp;quot;?) into
oblivion in a couple of years. In other words, HLT is a book that does not seem likely to
achieve a lofty position in the literature of computational language research—a pretty
lamentable position to be in for a work of this magnitude. So, what went wrong?
Computational Linguistics Volume 25, Number 1
Before I take up that question, let me note various points about HLT, including
the fact that the complete book is available—or was available at the time of writing
of this review—on the Web:1 http://www.cse.ogi.edu/CSLU/HLTsurvey/HLTsurvey.html
Here is a list of the chapters:

Each of these chapters opens with a profitable summary, written by an editorial board
member and setting the stage for the more-detailed contributions (in the form of
sections) that follow it. Each section deals with the major successes, methods, and
research problems of a particular special topic. Just to give an impression of the degree
of granularity for an average chapter, here is a breakdown of sections for Chapters 1,
3, and 6, respectively (excluding the chapter overviews and references):

books, albeit more carefully and sparingly) but I have some difficulty in understanding it. Surely, I
would not mind—and in fact would regard it as an exalted effort—if the survey had only an electronic
existence, without the imprint of such an estimable publisher as the Cambridge University Press. But
HLT is published as a hardcover book, so I cannot help but raise the question: Who will buy this book
if it is within the comfortable reach of every graduate student and professor? Libraries, maybe? Or
research labs with dollars to disburse? Needless to say, these are queries for Cambridge University
Press, not the editors of HLT. In any case, unless one has a weak spot for bound volumes, my
suggestion, naturally, would be not to buy the book but to make liberal use of the Web version.

The full catalogue of contributors to HLT reads like Who&apos;s Who in Language. A
brief and clearly one-sided list reflecting my own research tastes (after all, there are
about 100 authors) includes Annie Zaenen, Hans Uszkoreit, Lauri Karttunen, Fernando
Pereira, Hans Kamp, Per-Kristian Halvorsen, Karen Sparck Jones, Martin Kay, Aravind
Joshi, Ronald Kaplan, and Ken Church. The authority of the contributors is one aspect
of this volume which no one need doubt; HLT is the product of some of the best minds
actively toiling in the trenches.
With so many top-notch researchers contributing to this book, one would expect
the outcome to be no less than breathtaking. Alas, this has not happened. What one
has instead is a boring, run-of-the-mill product that would hardly impress a person
having only a broad acquaintance with the fields of NLP and speech processing. In
stark contrast, A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind (edited by Samuel Guttenplan,
Blackwell, 1994), another big book of a similar nature written by the brightest philoso-
phers of mind, and with which I am familiar, is regarded as a towering success in
philosophy circles. So such projects sometimes do achieve their goals. To repeat my
earlier question, what is the problem with HLT?
The regrettable state of affairs regarding HLT is mainly due to two reasons. First,
approximately 23% of the book is devoted to references. Another 13% is dedicated to a
glossary, an author index (which does not miss the opportunity to misspell Chomsky&apos;s
first name, in the tradition of Murphy), and a subject index.2 To make a long story
short, only less than two-thirds of the book promises any hope of presenting something
of substance.
However, and this is my second point, of the approximately 75 sections a great
majority are written in nontechnical language, glossing over the details. Clearly there
are some good contributions but they are in the minority.3 More often than not, what
we have is a superficial review.&apos; My impression is that the editors did not do their

2 On a related note, Chapter 12 includes, obviously with good intentions, four pages of e-mail and
home-page addresses for language resources such as written and spoken language corpora. The
annoying thing about such time-sensitive material is that it is somewhat obsolete even at the time of
galley proofs.
3 I quite enjoyed the following sections: Robust speech recognition, HMM methods in speech
recognition, Language representation, Sentence modeling and parsing, Dialogue modeling,
(Human-aided) machine translation: A better future, Statistical modeling and classification, Parsing
techniques. (This list is not exhaustive.)
4 For example, I found the following sections to be of doubtful quality: Handwriting analysis, Grammar
formalisms, Semantics, Discourse and dialogue (overview), Discourse modeling, Finite state technology,
Written language corpora, and almost all parts of Chapter 13. (Again, this is not an exhaustive list.)

homework well. I realize that it took them two years and half-a-dozen meetings to
create the volume. As a result, some authors have contributed quality pieces. Some
others had the potential to write fine surveys but did not really deliver; their pieces
were written far too hastily and this is glaringly obvious. It is as if these sections were
scribbled while their authors were working on more important things such as journal
articles or conference papers; it is so obvious that they did not devote themselves
to the task at hand. (So the editor-in-chief&apos;s words, &amp;quot;each author&apos;s contribution was
carefully reviewed and revisions were requested,&amp;quot; must be taken with a grain of salt.)
Overall, I wish the editors had taken the time to prepare a more polished prod-
uct for publication. In the meantime, the Web version of the book could have been
made available anyway. Furthermore, this would have been a pleasant opportunity
to canvass the language technology community in general about their views of the
book. In fact, if planned well, there is promise here for a higher-quality second edi-
tion, provided that a more leisurely (i.e., slow-paced) and conscientious approach as
hinted above is adopted. It is fair to note that the managing editors insinuate the same
point when they say &amp;quot;comments received from our readers will encourage us to edit
updated and improved versions of this work.&amp;quot;
Nowadays almost all documents come with some kind of executive summary.
What is it going to be in the case of this review? Well, I&apos;ve already remarked that HLT
is the work of a committee. So, remember that chestnut about camels and committees?
That says it all.
