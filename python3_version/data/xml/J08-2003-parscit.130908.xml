The availability of large scale data sets of manually annotated predicate–argument struc-
tures has recently favored the use of machine learning approaches to the design of automated
semantic role labeling (SRL) systems. The main research in this area relates to the design choices
for feature representation and for effective decompositions of the task in different learning models.
Regarding the former choice, structural properties offull syntactic parses are largely employed as
they represent ways to encode different principles suggested by the linking theory between syntax
and semantics. The latter choice relates to several learning schemes over global views of the
parses. For example, re-ranking stages operating over alternative predicate–argument sequences
of the same sentence have shown to be very effective.
In this article, we propose several kernel functions to model parse tree properties in kernel-
based machines, for example, perceptrons or support vector machines. In particular, we define
different kinds of tree kernels as general approaches to feature engineering in SRL. Moreover, we
extensively experiment with such kernels to investigate their contribution to individual stages
of an SRL architecture both in isolation and in combination with other traditional manually
coded features. The results for boundary recognition, classification, and re-ranking stages provide
systematic evidence about the significant impact of tree kernels on the overall accuracy, especially
when the amount of training data is small. As a conclusive result, tree kernels allow for a general
and easily portable feature engineering method which is applicable to a large family of natural
language processing tasks.

and Kingsbury 2005), inspired by Levin’s verb classes. To annotate natural language
sentences, such systems generally require (1) the detection of the target word em-
bodying the predicate and (2) the detection and classification of the word sequences
constituting the predicate’s arguments.
Previous work has shown that these steps can be carried out by applying machine
learning techniques (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005; Litkowski 2004), for which the
most important features encoding predicate–argument relations are derived from (shal-
low or deep) syntactic information. The outcome of this research brings wide empirical
evidence in favor of the linking theories between semantics and syntax, for example,
Jackendoff (1990). Nevertheless, as no such theory provides a sound and complete
treatment, the choice and design of syntactic features to represent semantic structures
requires remarkable research effort and intuition.
For example, earlier studies on feature design for semantic role labeling were car-
ried out by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and Thompson, Levy, and Manning (2003). Since
then, researchers have proposed several syntactic feature sets, where the more recent
sets slightly enhanced the older ones.
A careful analysis of such features reveals that most of them are syntactic tree
fragments of training sentences, thus a viable way to alleviate the feature design com-
plexity is the adoption of syntactic tree kernels (Collins and Duffy 2002). For example, in
Moschitti (2004), the predicate–argument relation is represented by means of the min-
imal subtree that includes both of them. The similarity between two instances is eval-
uated by a tree kernel function in terms of common substructures. Such an approach
is in line with current research on kernels for natural language learning, for example,
syntactic parsing re-ranking (Collins and Duffy 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko,
Aone, and Richardella 2003), and named entity recognition (Cumby and Roth 2003;
Culotta and Sorensen 2004).
Furthermore, recent work (Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning 2005; Punyakanok
et al. 2005) has shown that, to achieve high labeling accuracy, joint inference should
be applied on the whole predicate–argument structure. For this purpose, we need to
extract features from the sentence syntactic parse tree that encodes the relationships
governing complex semantic structures. This task is rather difficult because we do
not exactly know which syntactic clues effectively capture the relation between the
predicate and its arguments. For example, to detect the interesting context, the modeling
of syntax-/semantics-based features should take into account linguistic aspects like
ancestor nodes or semantic dependencies (Toutanova, Markova, and Manning 2004).
In this scenario, the automatic feature generation/selection carried out by tree kernels
can provide useful insights into the underlying linguistic phenomena. Other advantages
coming from the use of tree kernels are the following.
First, we can implement them very quickly as the feature extractor module only
requires the writing of a general procedure for subtree extraction. In contrast, traditional
SRL systems use more than thirty features (e. g., Pradhan, Hacioglu, Krugler et al. 2005),
each of which requires the writing of a dedicated procedure.
Second, their combination with traditional attribute–value models produces more
accurate systems, also when using the same machine learning algorithm in the combi-
nation, because the feature spaces are very different.
Third, we can carry out feature engineering using kernel combinations and marking
strategies (Moschitti et al. 2005a; Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili 2006). This allows us to
boost the SRL accuracy in a relatively simple way.
Next, tree kernels generate large tree fragment sets which constitute back-off
models for important syntactic features. Using them, the learning algorithm generalizes

better and produces a more accurate classifier, especially when the amount of training
data is scarce.
Finally, once the learning algorithm using tree kernels has converged, we can iden-
tify the most important structured features of the generated model. One approach for
such a reverse engineering process relies on the computation of the explicit feature
space, at least for the highest-weighted features (Kudo and Matsumoto 2003). Once
the most relevant fragments are available, they can be used to design novel effective
attribute–value features (which in turn can be used to design more efficient classifiers,
e. g., with linear kernels) and inspire new linguistic theories.
These points suggest that tree kernels should always be applied, at least for an initial
study of the problem. Unfortunately, they suffer from two main limitations: (a) poor
impact on boundary detection as, in this task, correct and incorrect arguments may
share a large portion of the encoding trees (Moschitti 2004); and (b) more expensive
running time and limited contribution to the overall accuracy if compared with manu-
ally derived features (Cumby and Roth 2003). Point (a) has been addressed by Moschitti,
Pighin, and Basili (2006) by showing that a strategy of marking relevant parse-tree nodes
makes correct and incorrect subtrees for boundary detection quite different. Point (b)
can be tackled by studying approaches to kernel engineering that allow for the design
of efficient and effective kernels.
In this article, we provide a comprehensive study of the use of tree kernels for se-
mantic role labeling. For this purpose, we define tree kernels based on the composition
of two different feature functions: canonical mappings, which map sentence-parse trees
in tree structures encoding semantic information, and feature extraction functions,
which encode these trees in the actual feature space. The latter functions explode the
canonical trees into all their substructures and, in the literature, are usually referred to as
tree kernels. For instance, in Collins and Duffy (2002), Vishwanathan and Smola (2002),
and Moschitti (2006a) different tree kernels extract different types of tree fragments.
Given the heuristic nature of canonical mappings, we studied their properties
by experimenting with them within support vector machines and with the data set
provided by CoNLL shared tasks (Carreras and M`arquez 2005). The results show that
carefully engineered tree kernels always boost the accuracy of the basic systems. Most
importantly, in complex tasks such as the re-ranking of semantic role annotations, they
provide an easy way to engineer new features which enhance the state-of-the-art in SRL.
In the remainder of this article, Section 2 presents traditional architectures for SRL
and the typical features proposed in literature. Tree kernels are formally introduced
in Section 3, and Section 4 describes our modular architecture employing support
vector machines along with manually designed features, tree kernels (feature extraction
functions), and their combinations. Section 5 presents our structured features (canonical
mappings) inducing different kernels that we used for different SRL subtasks. The
extensive experimental results obtained on the boundary recognition, role classification,
and re-ranking stages are presented in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the
conclusions.

The recognition of semantic structures within a sentence relies on lexical and syntactic
information provided by early stages of an NLP process, such as lexical analysis, part-of-
speech tagging, and syntactic parsing. The complexity of the SRL task mostly depends
on two aspects: (a) the information is generally noisy, that is, in a real-world scenario
the accuracy and reliability of NLP subsystems are generally not very high; and (b) the

lack of a sound and complete linguistic or cognitive theory about the links between
syntax and semantics does not allow an informed, deductive approach to the problem.
Nevertheless, the large amount of available lexical and syntactic information favors the
application of inductive approaches to the SRL task, which indeed is generally treated
as a combination of statistical classification problems.
The next sections define the SRL task more precisely and summarize the most
relevant work carried out to address these two problems.

2.1 Problem Definition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984869318181818">
The most well-known shallow semantic theories are studied in two different projects:
PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) and FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and
Lowe 1998). The former is based on a linguistic model inspired by Levin’s verb classes
(Levin 1993), focusing on the argument structure of verbs and on the alternation pat-
terns that describe movements of verbal arguments within a predicate structure. The
latter refers to the application of frame semantics (Fillmore 1968) in the annotation of
predicate–argument structures based on frame elements (semantic roles). These theories
have been investigated in two CoNLL shared tasks (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005)
and a Senseval-3 evaluation (Litkowski 2004), respectively.
Given a sentence and a predicate word, an SRL system outputs an annotation of the
sentence in which the sequences of words that make up the arguments of the predicate
are properly labeled, for example:
[Arg0 He] got [Arg1 his money] [C-V back]1
in response to the input He got his money back. This processing requires that: (1) the
predicates within the sentence are identified and (2) the word sequences that span the
boundaries of each predicate argument are delimited and assigned the proper role label.
The first sub-task can be performed either using statistical methods or hand-crafted
lexical and syntactic rules. In the case of verbal predicates, it is quite easy to write
simple rules matching regular expressions built on POS tags. The second task is more
complex and is generally viewed as a combination of statistical classification problems:
The learning algorithms are trained to recognize the extension of predicate arguments
and the semantic role they play.

2.2 Models for Semantic Role Labeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997919666666667">
An SRL model and the resulting architecture are largely influenced by the kind of data
available for the task. As an example, a model relying on a shallow syntactic parser
would assign roles to chunks, whereas with a full syntactic parse of the sentence it
would be straightforward to establish a correspondence between nodes of the parse tree
and semantic roles. We focused on the latter as it has been shown to be more accurate
by the CoNLL 2005 shared task results.
According to the deep syntactic formulation, the classifying instances are pairs
of parse-tree nodes which dominate the exact span of the predicate and the target
argument. Such pairs are usually represented in terms of attribute–value vectors, where

the attributes describe properties of predicates, arguments, and the way they are related.
There is large agreement on an effective set of linguistic features (Gildea and Jurafsky
2002; Pradhan, Hacioglu, Krugler, et al. 2005) that have been employed in the vast
majority of SRL systems. The most relevant features are summarized in Table 1.
Once the representation for the predicate–argument pairs is available, a multi-
classifier is used to recognize the correct node pairs, namely, nodes associated with
correct arguments (given a predicate), and assign them a label (which is the label of the
argument). This can be achieved by training a multi-classifier on n + 1 classes, where
the first n classes correspond to the different roles and the (n + 1)th is a NARG (non-
argument) class to which non-argument nodes are assigned.
A more efficient solution consists in dividing the labeling process into two steps:
boundary detection and argument classification. A Boundary Classifier (BC) is a binary
classifier that recognizes the tree nodes that exactly cover a predicate argument, that
is, that dominate all and only the words that belong to target arguments. Then, such
nodes are classified by a Role Multi-classifier (RM) that assigns to each example the
most appropriate label. This two-step approach (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002) has the
advantage of only applying BC on all parse-tree nodes. RM can ignore non-boundary
nodes, resulting in a much faster classification. Other approaches have extended this
solution and suggested other multi-stage classification models (e. g., Moschitti et al.
2005b in which a four-step hierarchical SRL architecture is described).
After node labeling has been carried out, it is possible that the output of the argu-
ment classifier does not result in a consistent annotation, as the labeling scheme may
not be compatible with the underlying linguistic model. As an example, PropBank-style
annotations do not allow arguments to be nested. This happens when two or more

overlapping tree nodes, namely, one dominating the other, are classified as positive
boundaries.
The simplest solution relies on the application of heuristics that take into account
the whole predicate–argument structure to remove the incorrect labels (e. g., Moschitti
et al. 2005a; Tjong Kim Sang et al. 2005). A much more complex solution consists in the
application of some joint inference model to the whole predicate–argument structure,
as in Pradhan et al. (2004). As an example, Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning (2005)
associate a posterior probability with each argument node role assignment, estimate the
likelihood of the alternative labeling schemes, and employ a re-ranking mechanism to
select the best annotation.
Additionally, the most accurate systems participating in CoNLL 2005 shared task
(Pradhan, Hacioglu, Ward et al. 2005; Punyakanok et al. 2005) use different syntactic
views of the same input sentence. This allows the SRL system to recover from syntactic
parser errors; for example, a prepositional phrase specifying the direct object of the
predicate would be attached to the verb instead of the argument. This kind of error
prevents some arguments of the proposition from being recognized, as: (1) there may
not be a node of the parse tree dominating (all and only) the words of the correct se-
quence; (2) a badly attached tree node may invalidate other argument nodes, generating
unexpected overlapping situations.
The manual design of features which capture important properties of complete
predicate–argument structures (also coming from different syntactic views) is quite
complex. Tree kernels are a valid alternative to manual design as the next section
points out.

Tree kernels have been applied to reduce the feature design effort in the context of
several natural language tasks, for example, syntactic parsing re-ranking (Collins and
Duffy 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella 2003), named entity
recognition (Cumby and Roth 2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004), and semantic role
labeling (Moschitti 2004).
On the one hand, these studies show that the kernel ability to generate large feature
sets is useful to quickly model new and not well understood linguistic phenomena
in learning machines. On the other hand, they show that sometimes it is possible to
manually design features for linear kernels that produce higher accuracy and faster
computation time. One of the most important causes of such mixed behavior is the
inappropriate choice of kernel functions. For example, in Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili
(2006) and Moschitti (2006a), several kernels have been designed and shown to produce
different impacts on the training algorithms.
In the next sections, we briefly introduce the kernel trick and describe the subtree
(ST) kernel devised in Vishwanathan and Smola (2002), the subset tree (SST) kernel
defined in Collins and Duffy (2002), and the partial tree (PT) kernel proposed in
Moschitti (2006a).

space over the real numbers, namely, Rn. The learning algorithm uses space metrics
over vectors, for example, the scalar product, to learn an abstract representation of all
instances belonging to the target class.
For example, support vector machines (SVMs) are linear classifiers which learn a
hyperplane f (�x) = w� × x� + b = 0, separating positive from negative examples. x� is the
feature vector representation of a classifying object o, whereas w� ∈ Rn and b ∈ R are
parameters learned from the data by applying the Structural Risk Minimization principle
(Vapnik 1998). The object o is mapped to x� via a feature function φ : O → Rn, O being
the set of the objects that we want to classify. o is categorized in the target class only if
f(-) ≥ 0.
The kernel trick allows us to rewrite the decision hyperplane as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998689666666667">
� � � � �yiαi�xi · x� + b = yiαiφ(oi) · φ(o) + b = 0
f(�x) = yiαi�xi · x� + b = i=1..l
i=1..l i=1..l
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998464">
where yi is equal to 1 for positive examples and −1 for negative examples, αi ∈ R with
αi ≥ 0, oi ∀i ∈ {1, .., l} are the training instances and the product K(oi, o) = (φ(oi) · φ(o))
is the kernel function associated with the mapping φ.
Note that we do not need to apply the mapping φ; we can use K(oi, o) directly.
This allows us, under Mercer’s conditions (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini 2004), to define
abstract kernel functions which generate implicit feature spaces. A traditional example
is given by the polynomial kernel: Kp(o1,o2) = (c + z1 · z2)d, where c is a constant and d
is the degree of the polynomial. This kernel generates the space of all conjunctions of
feature groups up to d elements.
Additionally, we can carry out two interesting operations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.849945461538461">
• kernel combinations, for example, K1 + K2 or K1 × K2
• feature mapping compositions, for example,
K(o1,o2) = Oφ(o1) · φ(o2)) = 4B(φA(o1)) · φB(φA(o2)))
Kernel combinations are very useful for integrating the knowledge provided by the
manually defined features with the knowledge automatically obtained with structural
kernels; feature mapping compositions are useful methods to describe diverse kernel
classes (see Section 5). In this perspective, we propose to split the mapping φ by defining
our tree kernel as follows:
• Canonical Mapping, φM(), in which a linguistic object (e. g., a syntactic
parse tree) is transformed into a more meaningful structure (e. g., the
subtree corresponding to a verb subcategorization frame).
• Feature Extraction, φS(), which maps the canonical structure in all its
fragments according to different fragment spaces S (e. g., ST, SST, and PT).
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.540528">
For example, given the kernel KST = φST(o1) · φST(o2), we can apply a canonical
mapping φM(), obtaining KMST = φST(φM(o1)) · φST(φM(o2)) = (φST ◦ φM)(o1) · (φST ◦
φM~(o2), which is a noticeably different kernel, which is induced by the mapping
(φST ◦ φM~.

3.2 Tree Kernel Spaces
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958136884615384">
The kernels that we consider represent trees in terms of their substructures (fragments).
The kernel function detects if a tree subpart (common to both trees) belongs to the fea-
ture space that we intend to generate. For this purpose, the desired fragments need to be
described. We consider three main characterizations: the subtrees (STs) (Vishwanathan
and Smola 2002), the subset trees (SSTs) or all subtrees (Collins and Duffy 2002), and the
partial trees (PTs) (Moschitti 2006a).
As we consider syntactic parse trees, each node with its children is associated with
a grammar production rule, where the symbol on the left-hand side corresponds to the
parent and the symbols on the right-hand side are associated with the children. The
terminal symbols of the grammar are always associated with tree leaves.
A subtree (ST) is defined as a tree rooted in any non-terminal node along with
all its descendants. For example, Figure 1a shows the parse tree of the sentence Mary
brought a cat together with its six STs. A subset tree (SST) is a more general structure
because its leaves can be non-terminal symbols. For example, Figure 1(b) shows ten
SSTs (out of 17) of the subtree in Figure 1a rooted in VP. SSTs satisfy the constraint that
grammatical rules cannot be broken. For example, [VP [V NP]] is an SST which has
two non-terminal symbols, V and NP, as leaves. On the contrary, [VP [V]] is not an
SST as it violates the production VP→V NP. If we relax the constraint over the SSTs, we
obtain a more general form of substructures that we call partial trees (PTs). These can be
generated by the application of partial production rules of the grammar; consequently
[VP [V]] and [VP [NP]] are valid PTs. It is worth noting that PTs consider the position
of the children as, for example, [A [B][C][D]] and [A [D][C][B]] only share single
children, i.e., [A [B]], [A [C]], and [A [D]].
Figure 1c shows that the number of PTs derived from the same tree as before is still
higher (i. e., 30 PTs). These numbers provide an intuitive quantification of the different
degrees of information encoded by each representation.

Although the literature on SRL is extensive, there is almost no study of the use of tree
kernels for its solution. Consequently, the reported research is mainly based on diverse
natural language learning problems tackled by means of tree kernels.
In Collins and Duffy (2002), the SST kernel was experimented with using the voted
perceptron for the parse tree re-ranking task. A combination with the original PCFG
model improved the syntactic parsing. Another interesting kernel for re-ranking was
defined in Toutanova, Markova, and Manning (2004). This represents parse trees as lists
of paths (leaf projection paths) from leaves to the top level of the tree. It is worth noting
that the PT kernel includes tree fragments identical to such paths.
In Kazama and Torisawa (2005), an interesting algorithm that speeds up the average
running time is presented. This algorithm looks for node pairs in which the rooted
subtrees share many substructures (malicious nodes) and applies a transformation to
the trees rooted in such nodes to make the kernel computation faster. The results show
a several-hundred-fold speed increase with respect to the basic implementation.

In Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella (2003), two kernels over syntactic shallow
parser structures were devised for the extraction of linguistic relations, for example,
person-affiliation. To measure the similarity between two nodes, the contiguous string
kernel and the sparse string kernel were used. In Culotta and Sorensen (2004) such kernels
were slightly generalized by providing a matching function for the node pairs. The
time complexity for their computation limited the experiments to a data set of just
200 news items.
In Shen, Sarkar, and Joshi (2003), a tree kernel based on lexicalized tree adjoining
grammar (LTAG) for the parse re-ranking task was proposed. The subtrees induced by
this kernel are built using the set of elementary trees as defined by LTAG.
In Cumby and Roth (2003), a feature description language was used to extract struc-
tured features from the syntactic shallow parse trees associated with named entities.
Their experiments on named entity categorization showed that when the description
language selects an adequate set of tree fragments the voted perceptron algorithm
increases its classification accuracy. The explanation was that the complete tree fragment
set contains many irrelevant features and may cause overfitting.
In Zhang, Zhang, and Su (2006), convolution tree kernels for relation extraction
were applied in a way similar to the one proposed in Moschitti (2004). The combina-
tion of standard features along with several tree subparts, tailored according to their
importance for the task, produced again an improvement on the state of the art.
Such previous work, as well as that described previously, show that tree kernels
can efficiently represent syntactic objects, for example, constituent parse trees, in huge
feature spaces. The next section describes our SRL system adopting tree kernels within
SVMs.

A meaningful study of tree kernels for SRL cannot be carried out without a comparison
with a state-of-the-art architecture: Kernel models that improve average performing
systems are just a technical exercise whose findings would have a reduced value. A
state-of-the-art architecture, instead, can be used as a basic system upon which tree
kernels should improve. Because kernel functions in general introduce a sensible slow-

We point out that we did not use any heuristic to filter out the nodes which are
likely to be incorrect boundaries, for example, as done in Xue and Palmer (2004). On the
one hand, this makes the learning and classification phases more complex because they
involve more instances. On the other hand, our results are not biased by the quality of
the heuristics, leading to more meaningful findings.
In the remainder of this section, we describe the main functional modules of our
architecture for SRL and introduce some basic concepts about the use of structured
features for SRL. Specific feature engineering for the above SRL subtasks is described

4.1 A Basic Two-Stage Role Labeling System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957625">
Given a sentence in natural language, our SRL system identifies all the verb predicates
and their respective arguments. We divide this step into three subtasks: (a) predicate
detection, which can be carried out by simple heuristics based on part-of-speech infor-
mation, (b) the detection of predicate–argument boundaries (i. e., the span of their words
in the sentence), and (c) the classification of the argument type (e. g., Arg0 or ArgM in
PropBank).
The standard approach to learning both the detection and the classification of
predicate arguments is summarized by the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9992538">
1. Given a sentence from the training set, generate a full syntactic parse tree;
2. let P and A be the set of predicates and the set of parse-tree nodes (i. e., the
potential arguments), respectively;
3. for each pair (p, a) E P x A:
• extract the feature representation, φ(p, a), (e. g., attribute–values or
tree fragments [see Section 3.1]);
• if the leaves of the subtree rooted in a correspond to all and
only the words of one argument of p (i. e., a exactly covers an
argument), add φ(p, a) in E+ (positive examples), otherwise
add it in E− (negative examples).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995267">
For instance, given the example in Figure 2(a), we would consider all the pairs (p, a)
where p is the node associated with the predicate took and a is any other tree node not
overlapping with p. If the node a exactly covers the word sequences John or the book,
then φ(p, a) is added to the set E+, otherwise it is added to E−, as in the case of the node
(NN book).
The E+ and E− sets are used to train the boundary classifier. To train the role
multiclassifier, the elements of E+ can be reorganized as positive E+argi and negative E−argi
examples for each role type i. In this way, a binary OVA classifier for each argument

i can be trained. We adopted this solution following Pradhan, Hacioglu, Krugler et al.
(2005) because it is simple and effective. In the classification phase, given an unseen
sentence, all the pairs (p, a) are generated and classified by each individual role classifier
Ci. The argument label associated with the maximum among the scores provided by Ci
is eventually selected.
The feature extraction function φ can be implemented according to different lin-
guistic theories and intuitions. From a technical point of view, we can use φ to map
(p, a) in feature vectors or in structures to be used in a tree kernel function. The next

We indicate with structured features the basic syntactic structures extracted from
the sentence-parse tree or their canonical transformation (see Section 3.1). In particular,
we focus on the minimal spanning tree that includes the predicate along with all of its
arguments.
More formally, given a parse tree t, a node set spanning tree (NST) over a set of
nodes Nt = {n1, ..., nk} is a partial tree of t that (1) is rooted at the deepest level and (2)
contains all and only the nodes ni E Nt, along with their ancestors and descendants. An
NST can be built as follows. For any choice of Nt, we call r the lowest common ancestor

of n1, ... , nk. Then, from the set of all the descendants of r, we remove all the nodes nj
that: (1) do not belong to Nt and (2) are neither ancestors nor descendants of any node
belonging to Nt.
Because predicate arguments are associated with tree nodes, we can define the pred-
icate argument spanning tree (ASTn) of a predicate argument node set Ap = {a1, ... , an}
as the NST over these nodes and the predicate node, that is, the node exactly covering
the predicate p.2 An ASTn corresponds to the minimal parse subtree whose leaves are
all and only the word sequences belonging to the arguments and the predicate. For
example, Figure 3a shows the parse tree of the sentence: John took the book and read its
title. took{ARG0,ARG1} and read{ARG0,ARG1} are two ASTn structures associated with the two
predicates took and read, respectively, and are shown in Figure 3b and 3c.
For each predicate, only one NST is a valid ASTn. Careful manipulations of an ASTn
can be employed for those tasks that require a representation of the whole predicate–
argument structure, for example, overlap resolution or proposition re-ranking.
It is worth noting that the predicate–argument feature, or PAF in Moschitti (2004),
is a canonical transformation of the ASTn in the subtree including the predicate p and
only one of its arguments. For the sake of uniform notation, PAF will be referred to as
AST1 (argument spanning tree), the subscript 1 stressing the fact that the structure only
encompasses one of the predicate arguments. An example AST1 is shown in Figure 3d.
Manipulations of an AST1 structure can lead to interesting tree kernels for local learning
tasks, such as boundary detection and argument classification.
Regardless of the adopted feature space, our multiclassification approach suffers
from the problem of selecting both boundaries and argument roles independently of
the whole structures. Thus, it is possible that (a) two labeled nodes refer to the same
arguments (node overlaps) and (b) invalid role sequences are generated (e. g., Arg0,
Arg0, Arg0, ...). Next, we describe our approach to solving such problems.

happens, for example, when both a node and one of its descendants are classified as
positive boundaries, namely, they received a role label. We say that such nodes are
overlapping as their leaf (i. e., word) sequences overlap. Because this situation is not
allowed by the PropBank annotation definition, we need a method to select the most
appropriate word sequence. Our system architecture can employ one of three different
disambiguation strategies:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.974521714285714">
• a basic solution which, given two overlapping nodes, randomly selects
one to be removed;
• the following heuristics:
1. The node causing the major number of overlaps is removed, for
example, a node which dominates two nodes labeled as arguments
2. Core arguments (i. e., arguments associated with the
subcategorization frame of the target verb) are always preferred
over adjuncts (i. e., arguments that are not specific to verbs or
verb senses)
3. In case the two previous rules do not eliminate all conflicts, the
nodes located deeper in the tree are discarded; and
• a tree kernel–based overlap resolution strategy consisting of an SVM
trained to recognize non-clashing configurations that often correspond
to correct propositions.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952777777778">
The latter approach consists of: (1) a software module that generates all the possible non-
overlapping configurations of nodes. These are built using the output of the local node
classifiers by generating all the permutations of argument nodes of a predicate and re-
moving the configurations that contain at least one overlap; (2) an SVM trained on such
non-overlapping configurations, where the positive examples are correct predicate–
argument structures (although eventually not complete) and negative ones are not. At
testing time, we classify all the alternative non-clashing configurations. In case more
than one structure is selected as correct, we choose the one associated with the highest
SVM score.
These disambiguation modules can be invoked after either the BC or the RM classifi-
cation. The different information available after each phase can be used to design differ-
ent kinds of features. For example, the knowledge of the candidate role of an argument
node can be a key issue in the design of effective conflict resolution methodologies, for
example, by eliminating ArgX, ArgX, ArgX, ... sequences. These different approaches
are discussed in Section 5.2.
The next section describes a more advanced approach that can eliminate overlaps
and choose the most correct annotation for a proposition among a set of alternative
labeling schemes.

In a real situation, many incorrect annotations are generated with no overlaps. To deal

an algorithm to evaluate the most likely labeling schemes for a given predicate, and (2)
a re-ranker that sorts the labeling schemes according to their correctness.
Step 1 uses the probabilities associated with each possible annotation of parse tree
nodes, hence requiring a probabilistic output from BC and RM. As the SVM learning
algorithm produces metric values, we applied Platt’s algorithm (Platt 1999) to convert
them into probabilities, as already proposed in Pradhan, Ward et al. (2005). These
posterior probabilities are then combined to generate the n labelings that maximize a
likelihood measure. Step 2 requires the training of an automatic re-ranker. This can be
designed using a binary classifier that, given two annotations, decides which one is
more accurate. We modeled such a classifier by means of three different kernels based
on standard features, structured features, and their combination.
4.4.1 Evaluation of the N-best Annotations. First, we converted the output of each node-
classifier into a posterior probability conditioned by its output scores (Platt 1999).
This method uses a parametric model to fit onto a sigmoid distribution the posterior
probability P(y = 1,f ), where f is the output of the classifier and the parameters are
dynamically adapted to give the best probability output.3 Second, we selected the n
most likely sequences of node labelings. Given a predicate, the likelihood of a labeling
scheme (or state) s for the K candidate argument nodes is given by:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999502">
p(s) = K pit (l), pit(l) = { (1− pi(ARG))2 otherwise
i=1 (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987556368421053">
where pi(l) is the probability of node i being assigned the label l, and pi(l) is the same
probability weighted by the probability pi(ARG) of the node being an argument. If l =
NARG (not an argument) then both terms evaluate to (1 − pi(ARG)) and the likelihood
of the NARG label assignment is given by (1 − pi(ARG))2.
To select the n states associated with the highest probability, we cannot evaluate
the likelihood of all possible states because they are exponential in number. In order
to reduce the search space we (a) limit the number of possible labelings of each node
to m and (b) avoid traversing all the states by applying a Viterbi algorithm to search
for the most likely labeling schemes. From each state we generate the states in which
a candidate argument is assigned different labels. This operation is bound to output at
most n states which are generated by traversing a maximum of n x m states. Therefore,
in the worst case scenario the number of traversed states is V = n x m x k, k being the
number of candidate argument nodes in the tree.
During the search we also enforce overlap resolution policies. Indeed, for any given
state in which a node nj is assigned a label l =� NARG, we generate all; and only the
states in which all the nodes that are dominated by nj are assigned the NARG label.
4.4.2 Modeling an Automatic Re-Ranker. The Viterbi algorithm generates the n most likely
annotations for the proposition associated with a predicate p. These can be used to build
annotation pairs, (si, sj), which, in turn, are used to train a binary classifier that decides if

Structured features are an effective alternative to standard features in many aspects. An
important advantage is that the target feature space can be completely changed even
by small modifications of the applied kernel function. This can be exploited to identify
features relevant to learning problems lacking a clear and sound linguistic or cognitive
justification.
As shown in Section 3.1, a kernel function is a scalar product 4)(o1) · 4)(o2), where
4) is a mapping in an Euclidean space, and o1 and o2 are the target data, for example,
parse trees. To make the engineering process easier, we decompose 4) into a canonical
mapping, 4)M, and a feature extraction function, 4)S, over the set of incoming parse
trees. 4)M transforms a tree into a canonical structure equivalent to an entire class of
input parses and 4)S shatters an input tree into its subparts (e. g., subtrees, subset trees,
or partial trees as described in Section 3). A large number of different feature spaces can
thus be explored by suitable combinations 4) = 4)S o 4)M of mappings.
We study different canonical mappings to capture syntactic/semantic aspects useful
for SRL. In particular, we define structured features for the different phases of the SRL
process, namely, boundary detection, argument classification, conflict resolution, and

For example, Figure 4 shows the parse tree of the sentence Paul delivers a talk in
formal style, highlighting the predicate with its two arguments, that is, Arg0 and Arg1.
Figure 5 shows the AST1, ASTm1 , and ASTcm

with the marked argument node, and the completely marked structure, respectively.
To understand the usefulness of node-marking strategies, we can examine Figure 6.
This reports the case in which a correct and an incorrect argument node are chosen by
also showing the corresponding AST1 and ASTm1 representations ((a) and (b)). Figure 6c
shows that the number of common fragments of two AST1 structures is 14. This is
much larger than the number of common ASTm1 fragments, that is, only 3 substructures
(Figure 6d).
Additionally, because the type of a target argument strongly depends on the type
and number of the other predicate arguments4 (Punyakanok et al. 2005; Toutanova,

Haghighi, and Manning 2005), we should extract features from the whole predicate
argument structure. In contrast, AST1s completely neglect the information (i. e., the tree
portions) related to non-target arguments.
One way to use this further information with tree kernels is to use the minimum
subtree that spans all the predicate–argument structures, that is, the ASTn defined in
Section 4.2.
However, ASTns pose two problems. First, we cannot use them for the boundary
detection task since we do not know the predicate–argument structure yet. We can
derive the ASTn (its approximation) from the nodes selected by a boundary classifier,
that is, the nodes that correspond to potential arguments. Such approximated ASTns
can be easily used in the argument classification stage.
Second, an ASTn is the same for all the arguments in a proposition, thus we need a
way to differentiate it for each target argument. Again, we can mark the target argument
node as shown in the previous section. We refer to this subtree as a marked target
ASTn (ASTmt
n ). However, for large arguments (i. e., spread over a large part of the
sentence tree) the substructures’ likelihood of being part of different arguments is quite
high.
To address this problem, we can mark all the nodes that descend from the target
argument node. We refer to this structure as a completely marked target ASTn (ASTcmt
n ).
ASTcmt
n s may be seen as AST1s enriched with new information coming from the other
arguments (i. e., the non-marked subtrees). Note that if we only consider the AST1
subtree from a ASTcmt
n , we obtain ASTcm
1 .

5.2 Structured Features for Conflict Resolution

This section describes structured features employed by the tree kernel–based conflict
resolution module of the SRL architecture described in Section 4.3. This subtask is
performed by means of:

1. A first annotation of potential arguments using a high recall boundary
classifier and, eventually, the role information provided by a role
multiclassifier (RM).
2. An ASTn classification step aiming at selecting, among the substructures
that do not contain overlaps, those that are more likely to encode the
correct argument set.

The set of argument nodes recognized by BC can be associated with a subtree of the
corresponding sentence parse, which can be classified using tree kernel functions. These
should evaluate whether a subtree encodes a correct predicate–argument structure or
not. As it encodes features from the whole predicate–argument structure, the ASTn that
we introduced in Section 4.2 is a structure that can be employed for this task.
Let Ap be the set of potential argument nodes for the predicate p output by BC; the
classifier examples are built as follows: (1) we look for node pairs (n1,n2) E Ap x Ap
where n1 is the ancestor of n2 or vice versa; (2) we create two node sets A1 = A − {n1}
and A2 = A − {n2} and classify the two NSTs associated with A1 and A2 with the tree
kernel classifier to select the most correct set of argument boundaries. This procedure
can be generalized to a set of overlapping nodes O with more than two elements, as we
simply need to generate all and only the permutations of A’s nodes that do not contain
overlapping pairs.

(in bold circles). The overlap resolution algorithm proposes two solutions (Figure 7b)
of which only one is correct. In fact, according to the second solution, the preposi-
tional phrase of the book would incorrectly be attached to the verbal predicate, that
is, in contrast with the parse tree. The ASTn classifier, applied to the two NSTs,
should detect this inconsistency and provide the correct output. Figure 7 also high-
lights a critical problem the ASTn classifier has to deal with: as the two NSTs are
perfectly identical, it is not possible to distinguish between them using only their
fragments.
In order to engineer novel features, we simply add the boundary information pro-
vided by BC to the NSTs. We mark with a progressive number the phrase type cor-
responding to an argument node, starting from the leftmost argument. We call the
resulting structure an ordinal predicate–argument spanning tree (ASTord
n ). For example,
in the first NST of Figure 7c, we mark as NP-0 and NP-1 the first and second argument
nodes, whereas in the second NST, we have a hypothesis of three arguments on three
nodes that we transform as NP-0, NP-1, and PP-2.
This simple modification enables the tree kernel to generate features useful for dis-
tinguishing between two identical parse trees associated with different argument struc-
tures. For example, for the first NST the fragments [NP-1 [NP PP]], [NP [DT NN]], and
[PP [IN NP]] are generated. They no longer match with the fragments of the second
NST [NP-0 [NP PP]], [NP-1 [DT NN]], and [PP-2 [IN NP]].
We also experimented with another structure, the marked predicate–argument
spanning tree (ASTmn ), in which each argument node is marked with a role label as-
signed by a role multi-classifier (RM). Of course, this model requires a RM to classify all
the nodes recognized by BC first. An example ASTmn is shown in Figure 7d.

5.3 Structures for Proposition Re-Ranking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963875">
In Section 4.4, we presented our re-ranking mechanism, which is inspired by the joint
inference model described in Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning (2005). Designing
structured features for the re-ranking classifier is complex in many aspects. Unlike
the other structures that we have discussed so far, the defined mappings should:
(1) preserve as much information as possible about the whole predicate–argument
structure; (2) focus the learning algorithm on the whole structure; and (3) be able
to identify those small differences that distinguish more or less accurate labeling
schemes. Among the possible solutions that we have explored, three are especially
interesting in terms of accuracy improvement or linguistic properties, and are described
hereinafter.
The ASTcmn (completely marked ASTn, see Figure 8a) is an ASTn in which each
argument node label is enriched with the role assigned to the node by RM. The la-
bels of the descendants of each argument node are modified accordingly, down to
pre-terminal nodes. The ASTcmt
n is a variant of ASTcmn in which only the target is
marked. Marking a node descendant is meant to force substructures matching only
among homogeneous argument types. This representation should provide rich syn-
tactic and lexical information about the parse tree encoding the predicate–argument
structure.
The PAS (predicate–argument structure, see Figure 8b) is a completely different
structure that preserves the parse subtrees associated with each argument node while
discarding the intra-argument syntactic parse information. Indeed, the syntactic links
between the argument nodes are represented as a dummy 1-level tree, which appears
in any PAS and therefore does not influence the evaluation of similarity between pairs

of structures. This structure accommodates the predicate and all the arguments of an
annotation in a sequence of seven slots.5 To each slot is attached an argument label to
which in turn is attached the subtree rooted in the argument node. The predicate is
represented by means of a pre-terminal node labeled rel to which the lemmatization of
the predicate word is attached as a leaf node. In general, a proposition consists of m
arguments, with m ≤ 6, where m varies according to the predicate and the context. To
guarantee that predicate structures with a different number of arguments are matched
in the SST kernel function, we attach a dummy descendant marked null to the slots not
filled by an argument.
The PAStl (type-only, lemmatized PAS, see Figure 8c) is a specialization of the PAS
that only focuses on the syntax of the predicate–argument structure, namely, the type
and relative position of each argument, minimizing the amount of lexical and syntactic
information derived from the parse tree. The differences with the PAS are that: (1) each
slot is attached to a pre-terminal node representing the argument type and a terminal
node whose label indicates the syntactic type of the argument; and (2) the predicate
word is lemmatized.
The next section presents the experiments used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed canonical structures in SRL.

The experiments aim to measure the contribution and the effectiveness of our proposed
kernel engineering models and of the diverse structured features that we designed
(Section 5). From this perspective, the role of feature extraction functions is not
fundamental because the study carried out in Moschitti (2006a) strongly suggests that
the SST (Collins and Duffy 2002) kernel produces higher accuracy than the PT kernel
when dealing with constituent parse trees, which are adopted in our study.6 We then
selected the SST kernel and designed the following experiments:

adopted in Moschitti et al. (2005b), in which the simple conflict resolution heuristic is
applied. The results were derived within the CoNLL setting by means of the related
evaluator.
In more detail, in the BD experiments, we used the first million instances from the
Penn TreeBank Sections 2–6 for training11 and Section 24 for testing. Our classification
model applied to this data replicates the results obtained in the CoNLL 2005 shared
task, that is, the highest accuracy in BD among the systems using only one parse
tree and one learning algorithm. For the complete SRL task, we used the previous
BC and all the available data, that is, the sections from 2 to 21, for training the role
multiclassifier.
It is worth mentioning that, as the automatic parse trees contain errors, some
arguments cannot be associated with any covering node; thus we cannot extract a
tree representation for them. In particular, Table 2 shows the number of arguments
(column 2) for sections 2, 3, and 24 as well as the number of arguments that we could not
take into account (Unrecoverable) due to the lack of parse tree nodes exactly covering
their word spans. Note how Section 24 of the Penn TreeBank (which is not part of the
Charniak training set) is much more affected by this problem.
Given this setting, the impact of node marking can be measured by comparing the
AST1 and the ASTm1 based kernels. The results are reported in the rows AST1 and ASTm1
of Table 3. Columns 2, 3, and 4 show their Precision, Recall, and F1 measure on BD and
columns 5, 6, and 7 report the performance on SRL. We note that marking the argument

node simplifies the generalization process as it improves both tasks by about 3.5 and 2.5
absolute percentage points, respectively.
However, Row Poly shows that the polynomial kernel using state-of-the-art fea-
tures (Moschitti et al. 2005b) outperforms ASTm1 by about 4.5 percentage points in BD
and 8 points in the SRL task. The main reason is that the employed tree structures
do not explicitly encode very important features like the passive voice or predicate
position. In Moschitti (2004), these are shown to be very effective especially when used
in polynomial kernels. Of course, it is possible to engineer trees including these and
other standard features with a canonical mapping, but the aim here is to provide new
interesting representations rather than to abide by the simple exercise of representing
already designed features within tree kernel functions. In other words, we follow the
idea presented in Moschitti (2004), where tree kernels were suggested as a means to
derive new features rather than generate a stand-alone feature set.
Rows Poly+AST1 and Poly+ASTm1 investigate this possibility by presenting the
combination of polynomial and tree kernels. Unfortunately, the results on both BD and
SRL do not show enough improvement to justify the use of tree kernels; for example,
Poly+ASTm1 improves Poly by only 0.52 in BD and 0.3 in SRL. The small improvement
is intuitively due to the use of (1) a state-of-the-art model as a baseline and (2) a very
large amount of training data which decreases the contribution of tree features. In the
next section an analysis in terms of training data will shed some light on the role of tree
kernels for BD and RC in SRL.

6.3 The Role of Tree Kernels for Boundary Detection and Argument Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993656217391304">
The previous section has shown that if a state-of-the-art model12 is adopted, then the
tree kernel contribution is marginal. On the contrary, if a non state-of-the-art model is
adopted tree kernels can play a significant role. To verify this hypothesis, we tested the
polynomial kernel over the standard feature vector proposed in Gildea and Jurafsky
(2002) obtaining an F1 of 67.3, which is comparable with the ASTm1 model, that is 65.71.
Moreover, a kernel combination produced a significant improvement of both models
reaching an F1 of 70.4.
Thus, the role of tree kernels relates to the design of features for novel linguistic
tasks for which the optimal data representation has not yet been developed. For exam-
ple, although SRL has been studied for many years and many effective features have
been designed, representations for languages like Arabic are still not very well under-
stood and raise challenges in the design of effective predicate–argument descriptions.
However, this hypothesis on the usefulness of tree kernels is not completely satis-
factory as the huge feature space produced by them should play a more important role
in predicate–argument representation. For example, the many fragments extracted by
an AST1 provide a very promising back-off model for the Path feature, which should
improve the generalization process of SVMs.
As back-off models show their advantages when the amount of training data
is small, we experimented with Poly, AST1, ASTm1 , Poly+AST1, and Poly+ASTm1 and
12 The adopted model is the same as used in Moschitti et al. (2005b), which is the most accurate among the
systems that use a single learning model, a single source of syntactic information, and no accurate
inference mechanism. If tree kernels improved this basic model they would likely improve the
accuracy of more complex systems as well.

different bins of training data, starting from a very small set, namely, 10,000 instances
(1%) to 1 million (100%) of instances. The results from the BD classifiers and the
complete SRL task are very interesting and are illustrated by Figure 9. We note several
things.
First, Figure 9a shows that with only 1% of data (i.e., 640 arguments) as positive
examples, the F1 on BD of the ASTm1 kernel is surprisingly about 3 percentage points
higher than the one obtained by the polynomial kernel (Poly) (i. e., the state of the art).
When ASTm1 is combined with Poly the improvement reaches 5 absolute percentage
points. This suggests that tree kernels should always be used when small training data
sets are available.
Second, although the performance of AST1 is much lower than all the other models,
its combination with Poly produces results similar to Poly+ASTm1 , especially when
the amount of training data increases. This, in agreement with the back-off property,
indicates that the number of tree fragments is more relevant than their quality.
Third, Figure 9b shows that as we increase training data, the advantage of using
tree kernels decreases. This is rather intuitive as (i) in general less accurate data machine
learning models trained with enough data can reach the accuracy of the most accurate
models, and (ii) if the hypothesis that tree kernels provide back-off models is true, a lot
of training data makes them less critical, for example, the probability of finding the Path
feature of a test instance in the training set becomes high.

Finally, Figures 9c and 9d show learning curves13 similar to Figures 9a and 9b, but
with a reduced impact of tree kernels on the Poly model. This is due to the reduced
impact of ASTm1 on role classification. Such findings are in agreement with the results
in Moschitti (2004), which show that for argument classification the SCF structure (a
variant of the ASTmn ) is more effective. Thus a comparison between learning curves of
Poly and SCF on RC may show a behavior similar to Poly and ASTm1 for BD.

6.4 Conflict Resolution Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981892857143">
In these experiments, we are interested in (1) the evaluation of the accuracy of our
tree kernel–based conflict resolution strategy and (2) studying the most appropriate
structured features for the task.
A first evaluation was carried out over gold-standard Penn TreeBank parses and
PropBank annotations. We compared the alternative conflict resolution strategies imple-
mented by our architecture (see Section 4.3), namely the random (RND), the heuristic
(HEU), and a tree kernel–based disambiguator working with ASTord structures. The
disambiguators were run on the output of BC, that is, without any information about the
candidate arguments’ roles. BC was trained on Sections 2 to 7 with a high-recall linear
kernel. We applied it to classify Sections 8 to 21 and obtained 2,988 NSTs containing at
least one overlapping node. These structures generated 3,624 positive NSTs (i. e., correct
structures) and 4,461 negative NSTs (incorrect structures) in which no overlap is present.
We used them to train the ASTord
n classifier. The F1 measure on the boundary detection
task was evaluated on the 385 overlapping annotations of Section 23, consisting of 642
argument and 15,408 non-argument nodes.
The outcome of this experiment is summarized in Table 4. We note two points.
(1) The RND disambiguator (slightly) outperforms the HEU. This suggests that the
heuristics that we implemented were inappropriate for solving the problem. It also
underlines how difficult it is to explicitly choose the aspects that are relevant for a
complex, non-local task such as overlap resolution. (2) The ASTord classifier outperforms
the other strategies by about 20 percentage points, that is, 91.11 vs. 73.13 and 71.50.
This datum along with the previous one is a good demonstration of how tree kernels
can be effectively exploited to describe phenomena whose relevant features are largely
unknown or difficult to represent explicitly. It should be noted that a more accurate
baseline can be provided by using the Viterbi-style search (see Section 4.4.1). However,
the experiments in Section 6.5 show that the heuristics produce the same accuracy (at
least when the complete task is carried out).

13 Note that using all training data, all the models reach lower F1s than the respective values shown in

process.

n ) and the role type information
(ASTmn ) provide tree kernels with more meaningful fragments because they improve
the basic model by about 4 percentage points.

useful clues for selecting correct predicate–argument structures because the ASTmn

n performance on both sections.

In these experiments, Section 23 was used for testing our proposition re-ranking. We
employed a BC trained on Sections 2 to 8, whereas RM was trained on Sections 2–12.15 In
order to provide a probabilistic interpretation of the SVM output (see Section 4.4.1), we
evaluated each classifier distribution parameter based on its output on Section 12. For
computational complexity reasons, we decided to consider the five most likely labelings
for each node and the five first alternatives output by the Viterbi algorithm (i. e., m = 5
and n = 5).
With this set-up, we evaluated the accuracy lower and upper bounds of our system.
As our baseline, we consider the accuracy of a re-ranker that always chooses the first
alternative output from the Viterbi algorithm, that is, the most likely according to the
joint inference model. This accuracy has been measured as 75.91 F1 percentage points;
this is practically identical to the 75.89 obtained by applying heuristics to remove

in the selection of the best annotations, which should be carried out by an automatic

Rows 2 and 3 of Table 6 show the number of distinct propositions and alternative
annotations output by the Viterbi algorithm for each of the employed sections. In row
3, the number of pair comparisons (i. e., the number of training/test examples for the
classifier) is shown.
Using this data, we carried out a complete SRL experiment, which is summarized in
Table 7. First, we compared the accuracy of the ASTcmn , PAS, and PAStlclassifiers trained
on Section 24 (in row 3, columns 2, 3, and 4) and discovered that the latter structure
produces a noticeable F1 improvement, namely, 78.15 vs. 76.47 and 76.77, whereas the
accuracy gap between the PAS and the ASTcmn classifiers is very small, namely, 76.77
vs. 76.47 percentage points. We selected the most interesting structured feature, that
is, the PAStl, and extended it with the local (to each argument node) standard features
commonly employed for the boundary detection and argument classification tasks, as
in Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning (2005). This richer kernel (PAStl+STD, column 5)
was compared with the PAStl one. The comparison was performed on two different
training sets (rows 2 and 3): In both cases, the introduction of the standard features
produced a performance decrement, most notably in the case of Section 12 (i. e., 82.07
vs. 75.06). Our best re-ranking kernel (i. e., the PAStl) was then employed in a larger
experiment, using both Sections 12 and 24 for testing (row 4), achieving an F1 measure
of 78.44.
First, we note that the accuracy of the ASTcmn and PAS classifiers is very similar (i. e.,
76.77 vs. 76.47). This datum suggests that the intra-argument syntactic information is
not critical for the re-ranking task, as including it or not in the learning algorithm does
not lead to noticeable differences.
Second, we note that the PAStl kernel is much more effective than those based on
ASTcmn and PAS, which are always outperformed. This may be due to the fact that

two ASTcmn s (or PASs) always share a large number of substructures, because most
alternative annotations tend to be very similar and the small differences among them
only affect a small part of the encoding of syntactic information; on the other hand,
the small amount of local parsing information encoded in the PAStls enables a good
generalization process.
Finally, the introduction of the standard, local standard features in our re-ranking
model caused a performance loss of about 0.5 percentage points on both Sections 12 and
24. This fact, which is in contrast with what has been shown in Haghighi, Toutanova,
and Manning (2005), might be the consequence of the small training sets that we
employed. Indeed, local standard features tend to be very sparse and their effectiveness
should be evaluated against a larger data set.

<bodyText confidence="0.999804472222222">
The design of automatic systems for the labeling of semantic roles requires the solution
of complex problems. Among other issues, feature engineering is made difficult by the
structured nature of the data, that is, features should represent information expressed
by automatically generated parse trees. This raises two main problems: (1) the mod-
eling of effective features, partially solved for some subtasks in previous works, and
(2) the implementation of the software for the extraction of a large number of such
features.
A system completely (or largely) based on tree kernels alleviates both problems
as (1) kernel functions automatically generate features and (2) only a procedure for the
extraction of subtrees is needed. Although some of the manually designed features seem
to be superior to those derived with tree kernels, their combination still seems worth
applying. Moreover, tree kernels provide a back-off model that greatly outperforms
state-of-the-art SRL models when the amount of training data is small.
To demonstrate these points, we carried out a comprehensive study of the use of
tree kernels for semantic role labeling by designing several canonical mappings. These
correspond to the application of innovative tree kernel engineering techniques tailored
to different stages of an SRL process. The experiments with these methods and SVMs on
the data set provided by the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez 2005) show
that, first, tree kernels are a valid support to manually designed features for many stages
of the SRL process. We have shown that our improved tree kernel (i.e., the one based
on ASTm1 ) highly improves accuracy in both boundary detection and the SRL task when
the amount of training data is small (e.g., 5 absolute percentage points over a state-of-
the-art boundary classifier). In the case of argument classification the improvement is
less evident but still consistent, at about 3%.
Second, appropriately engineered tree kernels can replace standard features in
many SRL subtasks. For example, in complex tasks such as conflict resolution or re-
ranking, they provide an easy way to build new features that would be difficult to
describe explicitly. More generally, tree kernels can be used to combine different sources
of information for the design of complex learning models.
Third, in the specific re-ranking task, our structured features show a noticeable im-
provement over our baseline (i. e., about 2.5 percentage points). This could be increased
considering that we have not been able to fully exploit the potential of our re-ranking
model, whose theoretical upper bound is 6 percentage points away. Still, although we
only used a small fraction of the available training data (i. e., only 2 sections out of 22
were used to train the re-ranker) our system’s accuracy is in line with state-of-the-art
systems (Carreras and M`arquez 2005) that do not employ tree kernels.

Finally, although the study carried out in this article is quite comprehensive, several
issues should be considered in more depth in the future:
(a) The tree feature extraction functions ST, SST, and PT should be studied in com-
bination with the proposed canonical mappings. For example, as the PT kernel seems
more suitable for the processing of dependency information, it would be interesting
to apply it in an architecture using these kinds of syntactic parse trees (e. g., Chen
and Rambow 2003). In particular, the combination of different extraction functions on
different syntactic views may lead to very good results.
(b) Once the set of the most promising kernels is established, it would be interesting
to use all the available CoNLL 2005 data. This would allow us to estimate the potential
of our approach by comparing it with previous work on a fairer basis.
(c) The use of fast tree kernels (Moschitti 2006a) along with the proposed tree repre-
sentations makes the learning and classification much faster, so that the overall running
time is comparable with polynomial kernels. However, when used with SVMs their
running time on very large data sets (e. g., millions of instances) becomes prohibitive.
Exploiting tree kernel–derived features in a more efficient way (e. g., by selecting the
most relevant fragments and using them in an explicit space) is thus an interesting
line of future research. Note that such fragments would be the product of a reverse
engineering process useful to derive linguistic insights on semantic role theory.
(d) As CoNLL 2005 (Punyakanok et al. 2005) has shown that multiple parse trees
provide the most important boost to the accuracy of SRL systems, we would like to
extend our model to work with multiple syntactic views of each input sentence.

<abstract confidence="0.998157368421053">The availability of large scale data sets of manually annotated predicate–argument structures has recently favored the use of machine learning approaches to the design of automated semantic role labeling (SRL) systems. The main research in this area relates to the design choices for feature representation and for effective decompositions of the task in different learning models. Regarding the former choice, structural properties offull syntactic parses are largely employed as they represent ways to encode different principles suggested by the linking theory between syntax and semantics. The latter choice relates to several learning schemes over global views of the parses. For example, re-ranking stages operating over alternative predicate–argument sequences of the same sentence have shown to be very effective. In this article, we propose several kernel functions to model parse tree properties in kernelbased machines, for example, perceptrons or support vector machines. In particular, we define different kinds of tree kernels as general approaches to feature engineering in SRL. Moreover, we extensively experiment with such kernels to investigate their contribution to individual stages of an SRL architecture both in isolation and in combination with other traditional manually coded features. The results for boundary recognition, classification, and re-ranking stages provide systematic evidence about the significant impact of tree kernels on the overall accuracy, especially when the amount of training data is small. As a conclusive result, tree kernels allow for a general and easily portable feature engineering method which is applicable to a large family of natural language processing tasks.</abstract>

For example, earlier studies on feature design for semantic role labeling were carried out by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and Thompson, Levy, and Manning (2003). Since then, researchers have proposed several syntactic feature sets, where the more recent sets slightly enhanced the older ones. A careful analysis of such features reveals that most of them are syntactic tree fragments of training sentences, thus a viable way to alleviate the feature design complexity is the adoption of syntactic tree kernels (Collins and Duffy 2002). For example, in Moschitti (2004), the predicate–argument relation is represented by means of the minimal subtree that includes both of them. The similarity between two instances is evaluated by a tree kernel function in terms of common substructures. Such an approach is in line with current research on kernels for natural language learning, for example, syntactic parsing re-ranking (Collins and Duffy 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella 2003), and named entity recognition (Cumby and Roth 2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004). Furthermore, recent work (Haghighi, Toutanova, an</context>

In this article, we provide a comprehensive study of the use of tree kernels for semantic role labeling. For this purpose, we define tree kernels based on the composition of two different feature functions: canonical mappings, which map sentence-parse trees in tree structures encoding semantic information, and feature extraction functions, which encode these trees in the actual feature space. The latter functions explode the canonical trees into all their substructures and, in the literature, are usually referred to as tree kernels. For instance, in Collins and Duffy (2002), Vishwanathan and Smola (2002), and Moschitti (2006a) different tree kernels extract different types of tree fragments. Given the heuristic nature of canonical mappings, we studied their properties by experimenting with them within support vector machines and with the data set provided by CoNLL shared tasks (Carreras and M`arquez 2005). The results show that carefully engineered tree kernels always boost the accuracy of the basic systems.

The manual design of features which capture important properties of complete predicate–argument structures (also coming from different syntactic views) is quite complex. Tree kernels are a valid alternative to manual design as the next section points out. 3. Tree Kernels Tree kernels have been applied to reduce the feature design effort in the context of several natural language tasks, for example, syntactic parsing re-ranking (Collins and Duffy 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella 2003), named entity recognition (Cumby and Roth 2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004), and semantic role labeling (Moschitti 2004). On the one hand, these studies show that the kernel ability to generate large feature sets is useful to quickly model new and not well understood linguistic phenomena in learning machines. On the other hand, they show that sometimes it is possible to manually design features for linear kernels that produce higher accuracy and faster computation time.

The kernel function detects if a tree subpart (common to both trees) belongs to the feature space that we intend to generate. For this purpose, the desired fragments need to be described. We consider three main characterizations: the subtrees (STs) (Vishwanathan and Smola 2002), the subset trees (SSTs) or all subtrees (Collins and Duffy 2002), and the partial trees (PTs) (Moschitti 2006a). As we consider syntactic parse trees, each node with its children is associated with a grammar production rule, where the symbol on the left-hand side corresponds to the parent and the symbols on the right-hand side are associated with the children. The terminal symbols of the grammar are always associated with tree leaves. A subtree (ST) is defined as a tree rooted in any non-terminal node along with all its descendants. For example, Figure 1a shows the parse tree of the sentence Mary brought a cat together with its six STs. A subset tree (SST)</context>

These numbers provide an intuitive quantification of the different degrees of information encoded by each representation. Figure 1 Example of (a) ST, (b) SST, and (c) PT fragments. 200 Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili Tree Kernels for Semantic Role Labeling 3.3 Feature Extraction Functions The main idea underlying tree kernels is to compute the number of common substructures between two trees T1 and T2 without explicitly considering the whole fragment space. In the following, we report on the Subset Tree (SST) kernel proposed in Collins and Duffy (2002). The algorithms to efficiently compute it along with the ST and PT kernels can be found in Moschitti (2006a). Given two trees T1 and T2, let { f1, f2, ..} = F be the set of substructures (fragments) and Ii(n) be equal to 1 if fi is rooted at node n, 0 otherwise. Collins and Duffy’s kernel is defined as K(T1,T2) = E E ∆(n1, n2) (1) n1ENT1 n2ENT2 where NT1 and NT2 are the sets of nodes in T1 and T2, respectively, and ∆(n1,n2) = �|F| i=1Ii(n1)Ii(n2). The latter is equal to the number of common fragments rooted in nodes n1 and n2. ∆ can be computed as follows: 1. If the productions (i.e. the node</context>
<context position="28125" citStr="Collins and Duffy (2002)" startWordPosition="4416" endWordPosition="4419">e, and n1. and n2 are not pre-terminals, then ∆(n1, n2) = �� c(11)(1 + ∆(cnl, cjn2 )), where nc(n1) is the number of children of n1 and cjn is the j-th child of n. Such tree kernels can be normalized and a λ factor can be added to reduce the weight of large structures (refer to Collins and Duffy [2002] for a complete description). 3.4 Related Work Although the literature on SRL is extensive, there is almost no study of the use of tree kernels for its solution. Consequently, the reported research is mainly based on diverse natural language learning problems tackled by means of tree kernels. In Collins and Duffy (2002), the SST kernel was experimented with using the voted perceptron for the parse tree re-ranking task. A combination with the original PCFG model improved the syntactic parsing. Another interesting kernel for re-ranking was defined in Toutanova, Markova, and Manning (2004). This represents parse trees as lists of paths (leaf projection paths) from leaves to the top level of the tree. It is worth noting that the PT kernel includes tree fragments identical to such paths. In Kazama and Torisawa (2005), an interesting algorithm that speeds up the average running time is presented. This algorithm lo</context>

Experiments The experiments aim to measure the contribution and the effectiveness of our proposed kernel engineering models and of the diverse structured features that we designed (Section 5). From this perspective, the role of feature extraction functions is not fundamental because the study carried out in Moschitti (2006a) strongly suggests that the SST (Collins and Duffy 2002) kernel produces higher accuracy than the PT kernel when dealing with constituent parse trees, which are adopted in our study.6 We then selected the SST kernel and designed the following experiments: (a) A study of canonical functions based on node marking for boundary detection and argument classification, that is, ASTm1 (Section 6.2).

These points suggest that tree kernels should always be applied, at least for an initial study of the problem. Unfortunately, they suffer from two main limitations: (a) poor impact on boundary detection as, in this task, correct and incorrect arguments may share a large portion of the encoding trees (Moschitti 2004); and (b) more expensive running time and limited contribution to the overall accuracy if compared with manually derived features (Cumby and Roth 2003). Point (a) has been addressed by Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili (2006) by showing that a strategy of marking relevant parse-tree nodes makes correct and incorrect subtrees for boundary detection quite different.

The former is based on a linguistic model inspired by Levin’s verb classes (Levin 1993), focusing on the argument structure of verbs and on the alternation patterns that describe movements of verbal arguments within a predicate structure. The latter refers to the application of frame semantics (Fillmore 1968) in the annotation of predicate–argument structures based on frame elements (semantic roles). These theories have been investigated in two CoNLL shared tasks (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005) and a Senseval-3 evaluation (Litkowski 2004), respectively. Given a sentence and a predicate word, an SRL system outputs an annotation of the sentence in which the sequences of words that make up the arguments of the predicate are properly labeled, for example: [Arg0 He] got [Arg1 his money] [C-V back]1 in response to the input He got his money back.

Nevertheless, as no such theory provides a sound and complete treatment, the choice and design of syntactic features to represent semantic structures requires remarkable research effort and intuition. For example, earlier studies on feature design for semantic role labeling were carried out by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and Thompson, Levy, and Manning (2003). Since then, researchers have proposed several syntactic feature sets, where the more recent sets slightly enhanced the older ones.

Such pairs are usually represented in terms of attribute–value vectors, where 1 In PropBank notation, Arg0 and Arg1 represent the logical subject and the logical object of the target verbal predicate, respectively. C-V represents the particle of a phrasal-verb predicate. 196 Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili Tree Kernels for Semantic Role Labeling the attributes describe properties of predicates, arguments, and the way they are related. There is large agreement on an effective set of linguistic features (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Pradhan, Hacioglu, Krugler, et al. 2005) that have been employed in the vast majority of SRL systems. The most relevant features are summarized in Table 1. Once the representation for the predicate–argument pairs is available, a multiclassifier is used to recognize the correct node pairs, namely, nodes associated with correct arguments (given a predicate), and assign them a label (which is the label of the argument). This can be achieved by training a multi-classifier on n + 1 classes, where the first n classes correspond to the different roles and the (n + 1)th is a NARG (nonargument) class</context>

In the next section an analysis in terms of training data will shed some light on the role of tree kernels for BD and RC in SRL. 6.3 The Role of Tree Kernels for Boundary Detection and Argument Classification The previous section has shown that if a state-of-the-art model12 is adopted, then the tree kernel contribution is marginal. On the contrary, if a non state-of-the-art model is adopted tree kernels can play a significant role. To verify this hypothesis, we tested the polynomial kernel over the standard feature vector proposed in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) obtaining an F1 of 67.3, which is comparable with the ASTm1 model, that is 65.71. Moreover, a kernel combination produced a significant improvement of both models reaching an F1 of 70.4. Thus, the role of tree kernels relates to the design of features for novel linguistic tasks for which the optimal data representation has not yet been developed. For example, although SRL has been studied for many years and many effective features have been designed, representations for languages like Arabic are still not very well understood and raise challenges in the design of effective predicate–argument </context>

In Collins and Duffy (2002), the SST kernel was experimented with using the voted perceptron for the parse tree re-ranking task. A combination with the original PCFG model improved the syntactic parsing. Another interesting kernel for re-ranking was defined in Toutanova, Markova, and Manning (2004). This represents parse trees as lists of paths (leaf projection paths) from leaves to the top level of the tree. It is worth noting that the PT kernel includes tree fragments identical to such paths. In Kazama and Torisawa (2005), an interesting algorithm that speeds up the average running time is presented. This algorithm looks for node pairs in which the rooted subtrees share many substructures (malicious nodes) and applies a transformation to the trees rooted in such nodes to make the kernel computation faster. The results show a several-hundred-fold speed increase with respect to the basic implementation. 201 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 In Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella (2003), two kernels over syntactic shallow parser structures were devised for the extraction of linguistic relations, for exampl</context>

Previous work has shown that these steps can be carried out by applying machine learning techniques (Carreras and M`arquez 2004, 2005; Litkowski 2004), for which the most important features encoding predicate–argument relations are derived from (shallow or deep) syntactic information. The outcome of this research brings wide empirical evidence in favor of the linking theories between semantics and syntax, for example, Jackendoff (1990).

For example, earlier studies on feature design for semantic role labeling were carried out by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and Thompson, Levy, and Manning (2003). Since then, researchers have proposed several syntactic feature sets, where the more recent sets slightly enhanced the older ones. A careful analysis of such features reveals that most of them are syntactic tree fragments of training sentences, thus a viable way to alleviate the feature design complexity is the adoption of syntactic tree kernels (Collins and Duffy 2002). For example, in Moschitti (2004), the predicate–argument relation is represented by means of the minimal subtree that includes both of them. The similarity between two instances is evaluated by a tree kernel function in terms of common substructures. Such an approach is in line with current research on kernels for natural language learning, for example, syntactic parsing re-ranking (Collins and Duffy 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella 2003), and named entity recognition (Cumby and Roth 2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004).

Tree kernels are a valid alternative to manual design as the next section points out. 3. Tree Kernels Tree kernels have been applied to reduce the feature design effort in the context of several natural language tasks, for example, syntactic parsing re-ranking (Collins and Duffy 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella 2003), named entity recognition (Cumby and Roth 2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004), and semantic role labeling (Moschitti 2004). On the one hand, these studies show that the kernel ability to generate large feature sets is useful to quickly model new and not well understood linguistic phenomena in learning machines. On the other hand, they show that sometimes it is possible to manually design features for linear kernels that produce higher accuracy and faster computation time.

Their experiments on named entity categorization showed that when the description language selects an adequate set of tree fragments the voted perceptron algorithm increases its classification accuracy. The explanation was that the complete tree fragment set contains many irrelevant features and may cause overfitting. In Zhang, Zhang, and Su (2006), convolution tree kernels for relation extraction were applied in a way similar to the one proposed in Moschitti (2004). The combination of standard features along with several tree subparts, tailored according to their importance for the task, produced again an improvement on the state of the art. Such previous work, as well as that described previously, show that tree kernels can efficiently represent syntactic objects, for example, constituent parse trees, in huge feature spaces. The next section describes our SRL system adopting tree kernels within SVMs. 4.

For example, Figure 3a shows the parse tree of the sentence: John took the book and read its title. took{ARG0,ARG1} and read{ARG0,ARG1} are two ASTn structures associated with the two predicates took and read, respectively, and are shown in Figure 3b and 3c. For each predicate, only one NST is a valid ASTn. Careful manipulations of an ASTn can be employed for those tasks that require a representation of the whole predicate– argument structure, for example, overlap resolution or proposition re-ranking. It is worth noting that the predicate–argument feature, or PAF in Moschitti (2004), is a canonical transformation of the ASTn in the subtree including the predicate p and only one of its arguments. For the sake of uniform notation, PAF will be referred to as AST1 (argument spanning tree), the subscript 1 stressing the fact that the structure only encompasses one of the predicate arguments. An example AST1 is shown in Figure 3d. Manipulations of an AST1 structure can lead to interesting tree kernels for local learning tasks, such as boundary detection and argument classification.

The main reason is that the employed tree structures do not explicitly encode very important features like the passive voice or predicate position. In Moschitti (2004), these are shown to be very effective especially when used in polynomial kernels. Of course, it is possible to engineer trees including these and other standard features with a canonical mapping, but the aim here is to provide new interesting representations rather than to abide by the simple exercise of representing already designed features within tree kernel functions.

The kernel function detects if a tree subpart (common to both trees) belongs to the feature space that we intend to generate. For this purpose, the desired fragments need to be described. We consider three main characterizations: the subtrees (STs) (Vishwanathan and Smola 2002), the subset trees (SSTs) or all subtrees (Collins and Duffy 2002), and the partial trees (PTs) (Moschitti 2006a). As we consider syntactic parse trees, each node with its children is associated with a grammar production rule, where the symbol on the left-hand side corresponds to the parent and the symbols on the right-hand side are associated with the children. The terminal symbols of the grammar are always associated with tree leaves. A subtree (ST) is defined as a tree rooted in any non-terminal node along with all its descendants.

In the following, we report on the Subset Tree (SST) kernel proposed in Collins and Duffy (2002). The algorithms to efficiently compute it along with the ST and PT kernels can be found in Moschitti (2006a). Given two trees T1 and T2, let { f1, f2, ..} = F be the set of substructures (fragments) and Ii(n) be equal to 1 if fi is rooted at node n, 0 otherwise. Collins and Duffy’s kernel is defined as K(T1,T2) = E E ∆(n1, n2) (1) n1ENT1 n2ENT2 where NT1 and NT2 are the sets of nodes in T1 and T2, respectively, and ∆(n1,n2) = �|F| i=1Ii(n1)Ii(n2). The latter is equal to the number of common fragments rooted in nodes n1 and n2. ∆ can be computed as follows: 1.

Experiments The experiments aim to measure the contribution and the effectiveness of our proposed kernel engineering models and of the diverse structured features that we designed (Section 5). From this perspective, the role of feature extraction functions is not fundamental because the study carried out in Moschitti (2006a) strongly suggests that the SST (Collins and Duffy 2002) kernel produces higher accuracy than the PT kernel when dealing with constituent parse trees, which are adopted in our study.6 We then selected the SST kernel and designed the following experiments: (a) A study of canonical functions based on node marking for boundary detection and argument classification, that is, ASTm1 (Section 6.2).

Therefore, we tested advanced canonical mappings, that is, those based on ASTcm,, , PAS, and PAStl, on such tasks (Section 6.5). 6.1 General Setup The empirical evaluations were mostly carried out within the setting defined in the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez 2005). As a target data set, we used the PropBank7 and the automatic Charniak parse trees of the sentences of Penn TreeBank 2 corpus8 (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) from the CoNLL 2005 shared-task data.9 We employed the SVM-light-TK software10, which encodes fast tree kernel evaluation (Moschitti 2006b), and combinations between multiple feature vectors and trees in the SVM-light software (Joachims 1999). We used the default regularization parameter (option -c) and λ = 0.4 (see Moschitti [2004]). 6.2 Testing Canonical Functions Based on Node Marking In these experiments, we measured the impact of node marking strategies on boundary detection (BD) and the complete SRL task, that is, BD and role classification (RC).

This would allow us to estimate the potential of our approach by comparing it with previous work on a fairer basis. (c) The use of fast tree kernels (Moschitti 2006a) along with the proposed tree representations makes the learning and classification much faster, so that the overall running time is comparable with polynomial kernels. However, when used with SVMs their running time on very large data sets (e. g., millions of instances) becomes prohibitive.

Most importantly, in complex tasks such as the re-ranking of semantic role annotations, they provide an easy way to engineer new features which enhance the state-of-the-art in SRL. In the remainder of this ar</context>

On the one hand, these studies show that the kernel ability to generate large feature sets is useful to quickly model new and not well understood linguistic phenomena in learning machines. On the other hand, they show that sometimes it is possible to manually design features for linear kernels that produce higher accuracy and faster computation time. One of the most important causes of such mixed behavior is the inappropriate choice of kernel functions. For example, in Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili (2006) and Moschitti (2006a), several kernels have been designed and shown to produce different impacts on the training algorithms. In the next sections, we briefly introduce the kernel trick and describe the subtree (ST) kernel devised in Vishwanathan and Smola (2002), the subset tree (SST) kernel defined in Collins and Duffy (2002), and the partial tree (PT) kernel proposed in Moschitti (2006a). 3.1 Kernel Trick The main concept underlying machine learning for classification tasks is the automatic learning of classification functions based on examples labeled with the class information. Such examples can be described</context>

The kernel function detects if a tree subpart (common to both trees) belongs to the feature space that we intend to generate. For this purpose, the desired fragments need to be described. We consider three main characterizations: the subtrees (STs) (Vishwanathan and Smola 2002), the subset trees (SSTs) or all subtrees (Collins and Duffy 2002), and the partial trees (PTs) (Moschitti 2006a). As we consider syntactic parse trees, each node with its children is associated with a grammar production rule, where the symbol on the left-hand side corresponds to the parent and the symbols on the right-hand side are associated with the children. The terminal symbols of the grammar are always associated with tree leaves. A subtree (ST) is defined as a tree rooted in any non-terminal node along with all its descendants. For example, Figure 1a shows the parse tree of the sentence Mary brought a cat together with its six STs. A subset tree (SST) is a more general structure because its leav</context>

Figure 1 Example of (a) ST, (b) SST, and (c) PT fragments. 200 Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili Tree Kernels for Semantic Role Labeling 3.3 Feature Extraction Functions The main idea underlying tree kernels is to compute the number of common substructures between two trees T1 and T2 without explicitly considering the whole fragment space. In the following, we report on the Subset Tree (SST) kernel proposed in Collins and Duffy (2002). The algorithms to efficiently compute it along with the ST and PT kernels can be found in Moschitti (2006a). Given two trees T1 and T2, let { f1, f2, ..} = F be the set of substructures (fragments) and Ii(n) be equal to 1 if fi is rooted at node n, 0 otherwise. Collins and Duffy’s kernel is defined as K(T1,T2) = E E ∆(n1, n2) (1) n1ENT1 n2ENT2 where NT1 and NT2 are the sets of nodes in T1 and T2, respectively, and ∆(n1,n2) = �|F| i=1Ii(n1)Ii(n2). The latter is equal to the number of common fragments rooted in nodes n1 and n2. ∆ can be computed as follows: 1. If the productions (i.e. the nodes with their direct children) at n1 and n2 are different, then ∆(n1, n2) = 0. 2. If the productions at n1 a</context>

Experiments The experiments aim to measure the contribution and the effectiveness of our proposed kernel engineering models and of the diverse structured features that we designed (Section 5). From this perspective, the role of feature extraction functions is not fundamental because the study carried out in Moschitti (2006a) strongly suggests that the SST (Collins and Duffy 2002) kernel produces higher accuracy than the PT kernel when dealing with constituent parse trees, which are adopted in our study.6 We then selected the SST kernel and designed the following experiments: (a) A study of canonical functions based on node marking for boundary detection and argument classification, that is, ASTm1 (Section 6.2).

Therefore, we tested advanced canonical mappings, that is, those based on ASTcm,, , PAS, and PAStl, on such tasks (Section 6.5). 6.1 General Setup The empirical evaluations were mostly carried out within the setting defined in the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez 2005). As a target data set, we used the PropBank7 and the automatic Charniak parse trees of the sentences of Penn TreeBank 2 corpus8 (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) from the CoNLL 2005 shared-task data.9 We employed the SVM-light-TK software10, which encodes fast tree kernel evaluation (Moschitti 2006b), and combinations between multiple feature vectors and trees in the SVM-light software (Joachims 1999). We used the default regularization parameter (option -c) and λ = 0.4 (see Moschitti [2004]). 6.2 Testing Canonical Functions Based on Node Marking In these experiments, we measured the impact of node marking strategies on boundary detection (BD) and the complete SRL task, that is, BD and role classification (RC).

In particular, the combination of different extraction functions on different syntactic views may lead to very good results. (b) Once the set of the most promising kernels is established, it would be interesting to use all the available CoNLL 2005 data. This would allow us to estimate the potential of our approach by comparing it with previous work on a fairer basis. (c) The use of fast tree kernels (Moschitti 2006a) along with the proposed tree representations makes the learning and classification much faster, so that the overall running time is comparable with polynomial kernels. However, when used with SVMs their running time on very large data sets (e. g., millions of instances) becomes prohibitive. Exploiting tree kernel–derived features in a more efficient way (e. g., by selecting the most relevant fragments and using them in an explicit space) is thus an interesting line of future research.

In contrast, traditional SRL systems use more than thirty features (e. g., Pradhan, Hacioglu, Krugler et al. 2005), each of which requires the writing of a dedicated procedure. Second, their combination with traditional attribute–value models produces more accurate systems, also when using the same machine learning algorithm in the combination, because the feature spaces are very different. Third, we can carry out feature engineering using kernel combinations and marking strategies (Moschitti et al. 2005a; Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili 2006).

This two-step approach (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002) has the advantage of only applying BC on all parse-tree nodes. RM can ignore non-boundary nodes, resulting in a much faster classification. Other approaches have extended this solution and suggested other multi-stage classification models (e. g., Moschitti et al. 2005b in which a four-step hierarchical SRL architecture is described).

The similarity between two instances is evaluated by a tree kernel function in terms of common substructures. Such an approach is in line with current research on kernels for natural language learning, for example, syntactic parsing re-ranking (Collins and Duffy 2002), relation extraction (Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella 2003), and named entity recognition (Cumby and Roth 2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004). Furthermore, recent work (Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning 2005; Punyakanok et al. 2005) has shown that, to achieve high labeling accuracy, joint inference should be applied on the whole predicate–argument structure. For this purpose, we need to extract features from the sentence syntactic parse tree that encodes the relationships governing complex semantic structures. This task is rather difficult because we do not exactly know which syntactic clues effectively capture the relation between the predicate and its arguments. For example, to detect the interesting context, the modeling of syntax-/semantics-based features should take into account linguistic aspects like ancestor node</context>

This reports the case in which a correct and an incorrect argument node are chosen by also showing the corresponding AST1 and ASTm1 representations ((a) and (b)). Figure 6c shows that the number of common fragments of two AST1 structures is 14. This is much larger than the number of common ASTm1 fragments, that is, only 3 substructures (Figure 6d). Additionally, because the type of a target argument strongly depends on the type and number of the other predicate arguments4 (Punyakanok et al. 2005; Toutanova, 4 This is true at least for core arguments. 209 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 Figure 6 (a) AST1s and (b) ASTm1 s extracted for the same target argument with their respective (c,b) common fragment spaces.

However, when used with SVMs their running time on very large data sets (e. g., millions of instances) becomes prohibitive. Exploiting tree kernel–derived features in a more efficient way (e. g., by selecting the most relevant fragments and using them in an explicit space) is thus an interesting line of future research. Note that such fragments would be the product of a reverse engineering process useful to derive linguistic insights on semantic role theory. (d) As CoNLL 2005 (Punyakanok et al. 2005) has shown that multiple parse trees provide the most important boost to the accuracy of SRL systems, we would like to extend our model to work with multiple syntactic views of each input sentence.

This allows us, under Mercer’s conditions (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini 2004), to define abstract kernel functions which generate implicit feature spaces. A traditional example is given by the polynomial kernel: Kp(o1,o2) = (c + z1 · z2)d, where c is a constant and d is the degree of the polynomial. This kernel generates the space of all conjunctions of feature groups up to d elements. Additionally, we can carry out two interesting operations: • kernel combinations, for example, K1 + K2 or K1 × K2 • feature mapping compositions, for example, K(o1,o2) = Oφ(o1) · φ(o2)) = 4B(φA(o1)) · φB(φA(o2))) Kernel combinations are very useful for integrating the knowledge provided </context>

In this article, we provide a comprehensive study of the use of tree kernels for semantic role labeling. For this purpose, we define tree kernels based on the composition of two different feature functions: canonical mappings, which map sentence-parse trees in tree structures encoding semantic information, and feature extraction functions, which encode these trees in the actual feature space. The latter functions explode the canonical trees into all their substructures and, in the literature, are usually referred to as tree kernels. For instance, in Collins and Duffy (2002), Vishwanathan and Smola (2002), and Moschitti (2006a) different tree kernels extract different types of tree fragments. Given the heuristic nature of canonical mappings, we studied their properties by experimenting with them within support vector machines and with the data set provided by CoNLL shared tasks (Carreras and M`arquez 2005). The results show that carefully engineered tree kernels always boost the accuracy of the basic systems. Most importantly, in complex tasks such as the re-ranking of semantic role annotations, they provide an easy way to engineer new features which enhance the state-of-the-art in SRL. In the</context>

On the other hand, they show that sometimes it is possible to manually design features for linear kernels that produce higher accuracy and faster computation time. One of the most important causes of such mixed behavior is the inappropriate choice of kernel functions. For example, in Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili (2006) and Moschitti (2006a), several kernels have been designed and shown to produce different impacts on the training algorithms. In the next sections, we briefly introduce the kernel trick and describe the subtree (ST) kernel devised in Vishwanathan and Smola (2002), the subset tree (SST) kernel defined in Collins and Duffy (2002), and the partial tree (PT) kernel proposed in Moschitti (2006a). 3.1 Kernel Trick The main concept underlying machine learning for classification tasks is the automatic learning of classification functions based on examples labeled with the class information. Such examples can be described by means of feature vectors in an n dimensional 198 Moschitti, Pighin, and Basili Tree Kernels for Semantic Role Labeling space over the real numbers, namely, Rn.

The kernel function detects if a tree subpart (common to both trees) belongs to the feature space that we intend to generate. For this purpose, the desired fragments need to be described. We consider three main characterizations: the subtrees (STs) (Vishwanathan and Smola 2002), the subset trees (SSTs) or all subtrees (Collins and Duffy 2002), and the partial trees (PTs) (Moschitti 2006a). As we consider syntactic parse trees, each node with its children is associated with a grammar production rule, where the symbol on the left-hand side corresponds to the parent and the symbols on the right-hand side are associated with the children. The terminal symbols of the grammar are always associated with tree leaves. A subtree (ST) is defined as a tree rooted in any non-terminal node along with all its descendants.
