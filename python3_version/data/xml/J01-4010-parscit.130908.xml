This book stems from the Sixth Summer School on Language and Speech Commu-
nication, held in Barcelona, Spain, in 1998, sponsored by ELSNET (The European
Network of Excellence in Human Language Technologies) and the EU TMR (Training
and Mobility of Researchers) program. The summer school, whose special theme was
&amp;quot;Robustness: Real life applications in language and speech,&amp;quot; is the third such summer
school to give rise to a book in this Kluwer series, following on from edited collections
by Young and Bloothooft (1997) and van Eynde and Gibbon (2000).
One slightly odd feature of the book, however, is that only 3 of the 10 courses
given at the summer school are represented by chapters in the book; the remaining 6
technical chapters are invited contributions from other researchers. The chapter titles
and authors, with an indication of whether the chapter originated from one of the
courses, are as follows:

<listItem confidence="0.995641615384615">
1. Introduction: Junqua and van Noord
2. Acoustic features and distance measure: de Veth, Cranen, and Boves
3. Speaker compensation in automatic speech recognition: Tapias (course:
&amp;quot;Robust speech recognition&amp;quot;)
4. Robustness in statistical language modeling: Bellegarda
5. Improving robustness by modeling spontaneous speech events: Heeman
and Allen
6. Regular approximation of context-free grammars: Mohri and Nederhof
7. Weighted grammar tools: The GRM library: Mohri
8. Robust parsing and beyond: Chartod (course: &amp;quot;Finite-state parsing&amp;quot;)
9. Robust parsing of word graphs: van Noord (course: &amp;quot;Robust efficient
parsing for spoken dialogue processing&amp;quot;)
10. Balancing robustness and efficiency: Rosé and Lavie

All of the chapters are at an introductory level and should be accessible to a com-
putational linguistics researcher who is not a specialist in the particular area. Even
though the material on speech processing requires some mathematical background

to understand fully, the main formulae are usually glossed and the text is illustrated
where appropriate with graphs, histograms, and block diagrams so the less mathe-
matical reader should come away with at least a broad understanding of the most
important points. Although the book is targeted at the nonspecialist, there is a dif-
ference in overall style between, roughly, the earlier chapters on speech and those on
language processing. Thus, chapters 2-4 consist of surveys and empirical comparisons
of a number of different techniques, whereas the succeeding chapters place more em-
phasis on the authors&apos; own work and less on comparing and contrasting competing
approaches.
The publisher&apos;s publicity suggests that the book contains material that could be
used in graduate or undergraduate courses. Some of the chapters might be suitable,
but the book would be too expensive for most students. For teaching purposes, it
might be worth waiting to see if ELSNET starts to sell the book at a discounted price,
as they have done with the previous two summer school books.
The book contains very few typos and is in the main well written, except that
the English in one chapter is unidiomatic. The chapter by Tapias refers the reader to
potentially useful ancillary material (proofs and MATLAB programs) on ELSNET Web
pages, but I was unable to find them there.
If this were the only recently published book that brought together robust language
and speech processing in an accessible way, then I would have no hesitation in recom-
mending it as a convenient reference. However, the book faces stiff competition from
excellent books by Rayner el al. (2000) and Wahlster (2000), both on speech-to-speech
translation. Each of these books forms a more coherent and satisfying whole, since
they describe a single complete application system, making it easier for the reader to
picture how the various pieces of robust processing technology fit together. Moreover,
these books are only two-thirds of the price of Junqua and van Noord&apos;s, and if I were
to buy only one book in this area it would be one of them.
