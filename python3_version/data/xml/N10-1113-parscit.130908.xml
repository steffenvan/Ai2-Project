We present a method for disambiguating syn-
tactic subjects from syntactic objects (a fre-
quent ambiguity) in German sentences taken
from an English-German bitext. We exploit
the fact that subject and object are usually eas-
ily determined in English. We show that a
simple method disambiguates some subject-
object ambiguities in German, while making
few errors. We view this procedure as the first
step in automatically acquiring (mostly) cor-
rect labeled data. We also evaluate using it to
improve a state of the art statistical parser.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999829375">
Ambiguity of grammatical role is a problem when
parsing a number of natural languages. In German,
subject-object ambiguities are frequent. The sen-
tence “Die Maus jagt die Katze” “the – mouse –
chases – the – cat” exhibits such an ambiguity. Be-
cause word order is freer in German than in English,
the sentence has two possible meanings: (i) The cat
is chasing the mouse and (ii) the mouse is chasing
the cat. We exploit the fact that such ambiguities are
much less frequent in languages that possess a less
flexible syntax than German. In English, the trans-
lation of the sentence “Die Maus jagt die Katze” is
not ambiguous. If we have access to this translation,
we can use this information to disambiguate the Ger-
man sentence. The English translation is viewed as
a surrogate for both contextual knowledge from the
text and for world knowledge.
We present a method for disambiguating the sub-
ject and object roles in German sentences. We use
an English-German bitext and exploit the fact that
subject and object roles are rarely ambiguous in En-
glish. Using a new gold standard we created we
show that our method disambiguates a significant
proportion of subject-object ambiguities in German
with high precision. We view this procedure as the
first step in automatically acquiring (mostly) correct
labeled data for training a statistical disambiguator
that can be used on German text (even when no
translation is available). In addition to measuring
algorithm performance directly, we present experi-
ments on improving the disambiguation of BitPar, a
state of the art statistical parser.

Data and Word Alignment. We use the aligned
English and German sentences in Europarl (Koehn,
2005) for our experiments. The corpus contains long
and complex sentences. To establish translational
correspondence between parallel sentences we use
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). Its input is a tok-
enized parallel corpus. We lemmatized the text prior
to aligning it.
Procedure. Figure 1 shows the architecture of
our system. The boxes signify data sets, while the
lines are processes applied to the data sets. The pa-
per presents two applications. The first is the cre-
ation of a set of disambiguated German sentences
(which involves word alignments in the upper right
corner, and the use of parsers in the middle of the
graphic). We also present a reranking of the N-best
parses produced by BitPar (Schmid, 2004), a state of
the art statistical parser (bottom of the graphic).

(Schiehlen, 2003), a fast shallow dependency parser.
FSPar has extensive lexical knowledge which helps
it to find subject-object ambiguities with high accu-
racy, but it does not try to resolve such ambiguities.
The key to our approach is to project syntactic
roles from English text. For English parsing we used
MINIPAR (Lin, 1998).
Based on FSPar’s analysis, all German sentences
with a subject-object ambiguity (about a third) were
selected from EuroParl. The parallel English sen-
tences were parsed with MINIPAR.
Words marked as ambiguous by FSPar were then
processed using our algorithm. If an ambiguous
German word was aligned to an English word that
MINIPAR had (unambiguously) assigned the gram-
matical role of subject or object, then the syntactic
role of the German word was defined by this infor-
mation, see Figure 2.

We used standard heuristics for improving word
alignment (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003),
but there were many misalignments of ambiguous
German words. In order for the procedure to work,
we require that the German word to be disam-
biguated be aligned to the English subject or object.
For this reason, we implemented second guessing
based on a dictionary that lists for every German
word the 10 most frequently aligned English words
(found using the word alignment of all of Europarl).
If an ambiguous German word was either unaligned
or not aligned to the English subject or object, it was
checked whether a dictionary translation was part of
the parallel sentence and marked as subject or ob-
ject by MINIPAR. If so, this dictionary word was
used for disambiguation.

Gold Standard. We had access to a small set of
gold standard parses (Pad´o and Lapata, 2009), but
decided to create a larger corpus. We found that FS-
Par had acceptable performance for finding subject-
object ambiguities1. The syntactic roles of words
marked as ambiguous by FSPar were annotated.
Four annotators annotated the syntactic roles in 4000
sentences using a graphical user interface (GUI).
The GUI showed the ambiguous words in context
and gave the annotator four different subject-object
labels to choose from for each ambiguous word:
subject, object, expletive es and none. Because the
syntactic expletive “es” (English gloss: ‘it’) is fre-
quent in German, as in “es scheint zu regnen” ‘it
appears to be raining,’ we created a separate label
for expletive “es”, which is not treated as a subject.2
The statistics are shown in table 1.
1000 sentences were annotated by all four an-
notators. Inter-annotator agreement was sufficient
(n = 0.77 on average (Carletta, 1996)).
Evaluation Measures. The output of our algo-
rithm labels each word that FSPar classified as am-
biguous with one of the three possible labels subject,
1FSPar has a very high precision in detecting subject-object
ambiguities, as can be seen in Table 1 (approximately 0.955,
the sum of two left columns divided by sum of all cells). We
tried to get an idea of recall using the smaller gold standard.
We made conservative assumptions about recall errors which
we manually checked on a small sample, details are omitted.
Using these assumptions led to an estimate for recall of 0.733,
but true recall is likely higher.
2German “es” is also frequently used as a non-expletive,
where it can take a syntactic role.

only keeping labels of subjects and objects that oc-

cessing we applied to GIZA++’s alignment. DE2EN
is the 1-to-N alignment calculated using German as
the source language and English as the target lan-
guage (i.e., each English word is linked to exactly
zero or one German words).
As we see in table 2, with the most strict setup,
filter-nosg, the algorithm resolves subject-object
ambiguities with a precision of more than 92%
but the best recall is only 39.4%, obtained using
DE2EN. Second guessing increases recall but leads
to losses in precision. The best precision result with-
out the filter is 85.5%.
Improving BitPar’s Subject-Object Decisions.
For improving BitPar (which always tries to disam-
biguate subject-object), our baseline is the accuracy
of the most probable parse shown in table 3, row 1.
Using the most probable parse from BitPar, we
relabel a word “subject” or “object” if our system
indicates to do so. With the algorithm alone we are
able to improve recall (table 3, row 2). When we add
the filter both precision and recall are improved (row
3). This experiment measures the improvement pos-
sible if our syntactic role information were directly
integrated as a hard constraint into a parser (see sec-
tion 5).
We now perform a simple reranking experiment,
using BitPar’s 100-best parses. For each sentence
we choose the parse which agrees with as many of
the subject/object decisions of the algorithm as pos-
sible (once again ignoring words where the algo-
rithm chooses no decision). In case of ties in the
number of agreements, we take the most probable
parse. The results are in rows 4–5. Reranking in-
creases F1 by about 0.8%.

Ngai, 2001; Hwa et al., 2005). In contrast with such
work, we are addressing subject-object ambiguity in
German. German parsers have no access to the con-
textual and world knowledge necessary to resolve
this ambiguity.
Work on projecting semantic roles (Pad´o and La-
pata, 2009; Fung et al., 2007) requires both syntac-
tic parsing and semantic role labeling and is con-
cerned with filling in the complete information in a
semantic frame. Our approach is simpler and con-
cerned only with syntactic disambiguation, not se-
mantic projection. We focus only on difficult cases
of subject-object ambiguity and although we do not
always make a prediction, we obtain levels of pre-
cision that projection approaches making no use of
knowledge of German syntax cannot achieve.
In bitext parsing, Burkett and Klein (2008) and
Fraser et al. (2009) used feature functions defined on
triples of (parse tree in language 1, parse tree in lan-
guage 2, word alignment), combined in a log-linear
model trained to maximize parse accuracy, requir-
ing translated treebanks. We focus only on subject-
object disambiguation in German, and annotated a
new gold standard. We work on sentences that a
partial parser has determined to be ambiguous. Fos-
sum and Knight (2008) and Huang et al. (2009) im-
prove English prepositional phrase attachment using
features from an unparsed Chinese sentence. The
latter work integrated the PP-attachment constraint
(detected from the Chinese translation) directly into
an English shift-reduce parser. As we have shown
in the labeling experiment, integrating our subject-
object disambiguation into BitPar could result in fur-
ther increases beyond 100-best reranking.

<bodyText confidence="0.999985785714286">
We demonstrated the utility of bitext-based disam-
biguation of grammatical roles. We automatically
created a large corpus of 164,874 disambiguated
subject-object decisions with a precision of over
92%. This corpus will be of use in future research
on syntactic role preferences and for the training
of monolingual subject-object disambiguators. We
presented a prototype application of subject-object
disambiguation through a simple reranking of the
100-best list output by BitPar, and showed a possible
further improvement if integrated in the parser. The
new gold standard, which is publicly available, will
hopefully be useful for work on both monolingual
and bitext-based disambiguation.

In bitext parsing, Burkett and Klein (2008) and Fraser et al. (2009) used feature functions defined on triples of (parse tree in language 1, parse tree in language 2, word alignment), combined in a log-linear model trained to maximize parse accuracy, requiring translated treebanks. We focus only on subjectobject disambiguation in German, and annotated a new gold standard. We work on sentences that a partial parser has determined to be ambiguous. Fossum and Knight (2008) and Huang et al. (2009) improve English prepositional phrase attachment using features from an unparsed Chinese sentence. The latter work integrated the PP-attachment constraint (detected from the Chinese translation) directly into an English shift-reduce parser. As we have shown in the labeling experiment, integrating our subjectobject disambiguation into BitPar could result in further increases beyond 100-best reranking. 6 Conclusion We demonstrated the utility of bitext-based disambiguation of grammatical roles. We automatically created a large corpus of 164,874 disambiguated subject-object decisions with a preci</context>

We now perform a simple reranking experiment, using BitPar’s 100-best parses. For each sentence we choose the parse which agrees with as many of the subject/object decisions of the algorithm as possible (once again ignoring words where the algorithm chooses no decision). In case of ties in the number of agreements, we take the most probable parse. The results are in rows 4–5. Reranking increases F1 by about 0.8%. 5 Related Work Syntactic projection has been used to bootstrap treebanks in resource poor languages (Yarowsky and 739 Ngai, 2001; Hwa et al., 2005). In contrast with such work, we are addressing subject-object ambiguity in German. German parsers have no access to the contextual and world knowledge necessary to resolve this ambiguity. Work on projecting semantic roles (Pad´o and Lapata, 2009; Fung et al., 2007) requires both syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling and is concerned with filling in the complete information in a semantic frame. Our approach is simpler and concerned only with syntactic disambiguation, not semantic projection. We focus only on difficult cases of subject-object ambiguity and although we do not always make </context>

In order for the procedure to work, we require that the German word to be disambiguated be aligned to the English subject or object. For this reason, we implemented second guessing based on a dictionary that lists for every German word the 10 most frequently aligned English words (found using the word alignment of all of Europarl).
