Ray Perrault, Chair, reported for the Program
Committee (which consisted of himself, Chip Bruce,
Jaime Carbonell, Mitch Marcus, Ellen Prince, and
Ralph Weischedel). Twenty-five papers were accepted
out of the sixty submitted. In addition, two panel
sessions were held: Norm Sondheimer organized one
on &amp;quot;Evaluation of Natural Language Interfaces to
Database Systems;&amp;quot; Jane Robinson organized one on
&amp;quot;Perspectives on Parsing Issues.&amp;quot; The Proceedings of
the Conference contains full texts for most of the
papers and statements prepared by most of the panel-
ists. [Details of the program are provided in the
January-March 1981 issue of the AJCL, Volume 7,
Number 1, pages 47-48. Copies of the Proceedings at
$10 (add $3 for US first class mailing and $6 for over-
seas airprinted delivery) are still available and can be
ordered from the Secretary-Treasurer.]

Jerry Kaplan reported that over 180 people were
registered for the conference. Arrangements were
proceeding smoothly, with the banquet and Presiden-
tial Address yet to come. [The final figures for at-
tendance are: 187 total, including 40 students; 44 new
members were added to ACL; 140 people attended
the banquet.]

<bodyText confidence="0.999792533333333">
He reviewed the financial status of the Association
for 1980 and the period of 1981 through 5-31. The
income figures for the two periods were $24,796.89
and $25,973.41, respectively; the corresponding ex-
penses, $19,601.38 and $17,127.14; the balances,
$5,195.51 and $8,846.27; and the assets, $31,645.64
and $40,491.91. [Revised provisional figures for the
full calendar year are included in the attachment at the
end of these minutes instead of the material presented
at the meeting. The corresponding figures for all of
1982 are: income, $47,744.07; expenses, 41,610.02;
balance, 6,134.05; and assets, $37,779.69.] Walker
noted the substantial AFIPS contribution [$7,750.33
by the end of the year], noting that the membership
drive, announced at the meeting last year, was institut-
ed to allow ACL to retain its current status in AFIPS
by getting 1500 members, thus allowing us to continue
to receive such contributions.
Walker presented the membership figures for 1977,
1978, 1979-80, and 1981 through June. For those
four periods, the numbers of individual members were
500, 444, 658, and approximately 800; for institution-
al members, they were 201, 218, 249, and 218; with
total membership figures of 701, 662, 907, and ap-
proximately 1000. Although in mid-passage, the effort
to recruit members certainly has produced results.
[Revised provisional figures for the full calendar year
are included in the attachment at the end of these
minutes instead of the material presented at the meet-
ing. The corresponding figures for all of 1982 are
1190 individual, 257 institutional, and 1447 total. A
grand tribute to the membership drive.]
Jim Moore described the membership drive, which
involved the creation of a poster and the assembling of
lists of relevant organizations and of members from a
large number of such organizations to mobilize a large
mailing. In addition, booths were set up at the Na-
tional Computer and Office Automation Conferences
[and subsequently at IJCAI in Vancouver] to distrib-
ute information. [Although the cost has been high,
over $7,000, the additional 450-500 members added in
this manner has provided good justification.] A sugges-
tion was made that solicitations to increase institution-
al membership be made by asking members to ask
their libraries to subscribe.

<bodyText confidence="0.9605996">
George Heidorn reported production of the Ameri-
can Journal of Computational Linguistics is proceeding
well. Two issues for 1980 have been completed, the
second one currently at the printers. Three articles
have appeared in each issue. Of 48 papers submitted,
14 have been published, 19 rejected, 5 are being re-
vised, and 10 are in the review process. One confer-
ence paper has been published; one is in the process
of revision. He expressed his appreciation to the As-
sociate Editor, the Editorial Board, the referees, the
President, and the Secretary-Treasurer. Heidorn asked
for more papers, more technical reports for inclusion
in the abstracts, announcements of all kinds, and ex-
pressions of interest in book reviews.

Executive Committee Meeting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951565217392">
Sondheimer began a review of topics discussed at
the Executive Committee Meeting.
Walker announced that a fund had been established
at MIT in honor of Bill Martin, a long time ACL
member who had died early in June. Bill was Profes-
sor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
and in the Sloan School of Management at MIT.
Walker suggested that the ACL contribute $100 to
this fund, a recommendation that was unanimously
approved.
Walker noted that 1982 would be the twentieth
anniversary of the ACL; a commemorative session at
the 1982 meeting is being planned.
Martha Evens reported that 75,000 people attended
the June National Computer Conference in Chicago.
Two ACL sessions were featured, one presenting pa-
pers, the other a panel [see the July-December 1980
issue of the AJCL, Volume 6, Number 3-4, page 193].
Both were well attended, and the New York Times
interviewed Lance Miller and Bozena Thompson.
Carole Hafner, Raoul Smith, and Kurt Godden helped
maintain the ACL booth there. Paul Orgren took
responsibility for the ACL booth at the Office Auto-
mation Conference in Houston in March.
Sondheimer reported on a Workshop on Applied
Computational Linguistics in Perspective, sponsored
by the Naval Research Laboratory that had been held
the previous Friday and Saturday (26-27 June). There
were five panels: Natural Language Interfaces to Com-
puter Systems, Language Styles for Specialized Appli-
cations, Machine and Machine-Aided Translation of
Technical Documents, Text Generation from Concept
Representations, and Concept Extraction from Factual
Text. The participants were pleased with the results,
and a report is planned for publication in the AJCL.
Stan Petrick reported on a set of ACL sessions plan-
ned for the Linguistic Society of America meeting in
December in New York City. He announced a call for
papers with a deadline for submission of 21 August.
[For the actual program, see the July-September 1981
issue of the AJCL, Volume 7, Number 3, page 180.]
The next annual meeting is scheduled for 16-18
June at the University of Toronto. Lyn Bates will be
Program Chair; Ray Perrault will handle Local Ar-
rangements. Specials sessions on speech acts or inter-
face systems are being considered, as well as the 20th
anniversary session referred to above.
A special meeting on applied issues in natural lan-
guage processing also is under consideration for late
1982 or early 1983. [The meeting on Applied Natural
Language Processing is now scheduled for February
1983 in Santa Monica, California. Iris Kameny is
responsible for its organization.]
Cambridge/Boston has been chosen as the location
for the 1983 annual meeting; June or August are being
considered as appropriate times.
Martin Kay announced that the 1984 meeting will
be held in conjunction with COLING-84. He will
function as the U.S. coordinator for the conference,
which will be held at Stanford early in July of that
year. A mini-summer school is being planned for the
two prior weeks. Kay pointed out that COLING-82
was scheduled for 6-10 July 1982 in Prague; he urged
people to submit papers and attend.
Paul Chapin described the plans to publish an ACL
Monograph Series, issuing two to three volumes a
year. A number of publishers have expressed interest.
A variety of kinds of publications are being considered
in addition to regular manuscripts: papers from special
meetings, theses, collections of published papers. He
solicited reactions from the membership. A motion
was made by Bill Mann empowering the Executive
Committee to organize an editorial board and enter
into negotiations for publication of a monograph se-
ries; it passed unanimously.
Sondheimer announced that the ACL was gathering
information on graduate programs in computational
linguistics; Martha Evens and Lauri Karttunen are
responsible. Anyone with information on course of-
ferings is urged to get in touch with one of them. The
need for a careers brochure also is recognized; he
solicited volunteers [and succeeded in getting Carole
Hafner to accept responsibility].
With regard to relations with other societies, it was
noted that SIGART now has Barbara Grosz and Ron
Brachman in charge and that both Grosz and Walker
are involved with the AAAI.
Sondheimer remarked on his concerns for funding
cuts by the federal government; he indicated that the
ACL was expressing these concerns in Washington
and trying to mobilize other professional societies to
do likewise.

Program of the ACL Sessions at NCC
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952409090909">
The ACL will sponsor two sessions at the 1982
National Computer Conference (NCC), to be held
June 7-10, 1982, in the Astrohall and Astroarena in
Houston, Texas. The NCC is sponsored by AFIPS
and four of its constituent societies: the Association
for Computing Machinery, the Data Processing Man-
agement Association, the IEEE Computer Society, and
the Society for Computer Simulation.
At this year&apos;s NCC, more than 600 firms will dis-
play the latest advances in computer hardware, soft-
ware, and services. They will occupy some 325,00 net
square feet of exhibit space, up 95,000 net square feet
from NCC &apos;81. In addition, a technical program will
focus on &amp;quot;Advancing Professionalism.&amp;quot; Its aim is to
emphasize the fact that even as systems become in-
creasingly ubiquitous through office automation and
home computing, there are methods for building them
to be usable, reliable, and efficient.
The two ACL-sponsored sessions are scheduled for
Wednesday, June 9, and will address the topics of
machine-readable dictionaries and natural language
help systems. Short descriptions of each follow.

The NCC is sponsored by AFIPS and four of its constituent societies: the Association for Computing Machinery, the Data Processing Management Association, the IEEE Computer Society, and the Society for Computer Simulation. At this year&apos;s NCC, more than 600 firms will display the latest advances in computer hardware, software, and services. They will occupy some 325,00 net square feet of exhibit space, up 95,000 net square feet from NCC &apos;81. In addition, a technical program will focus on &amp;quot;Advancing Professionalism.&amp;quot; Its aim is to emphasize the fact that even as systems become increasingly ubiquitous through office automation and computing, there for building them to be usable, reliable, and efficient. The two ACL-sponsored sessions are scheduled for Wednesday, June 9, and will address the topics of machine-readable dictionaries and natural language help systems.
