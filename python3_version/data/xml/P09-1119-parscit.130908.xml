Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999917962962963">
User generated content is characterized
by short, noisy documents, with many
spelling errors and unexpected language
usage. To bridge the vocabulary gap be-
tween the user’s information need and
documents in a specific user generated
content environment, the blogosphere, we
apply a form of query expansion, i.e.,
adding and reweighing query terms. Since
the blogosphere is noisy, query expansion
on the collection itself is rarely effective
but external, edited collections are more
suitable. We propose a generative model
for expanding queries using external col-
lections in which dependencies between
queries, documents, and expansion doc-
uments are explicitly modeled. Differ-
ent instantiations of our model are dis-
cussed and make different (in)dependence
assumptions. Results using two exter-
nal collections (news and Wikipedia) show
that external expansion for retrieval of user
generated content is effective; besides,
conditioning the external collection on the
query is very beneficial, and making can-
didate expansion terms dependent on just
the document seems sufficient.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980592592593">
One of the grand challenges in information re-
trieval is to bridge the vocabulary gap between a
user and her information need on the one hand and
the relevant documents on the other (Baeza-Yates
and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). In the setting of blogs
or other types of user generated content, bridging
this gap becomes even more challenging. This has
several causes: (i) the spelling errors, unusual, cre-
ative or unfocused language usage resulting from
the lack of top-down rules and editors in the con-
tent creation process, and (ii) the (often) limited
length of user generated documents.
Query expansion, i.e., modifying the query by
adding and reweighing terms, is an often used
technique to bridge the vocabulary gap. In gen-
eral, query expansion helps more queries than
it hurts (Balog et al., 2008b; Manning et al.,
2008). However, when working with user gener-
ated content, expanding a query with terms taken
from the very corpus in which one is searching
tends to be less effective (Arguello et al., 2008a;
Weerkamp and de Rijke, 2008b)—topic drift is
a frequent phenomenon here. To be able to ar-
rive at a richer representation of the user’s infor-
mation need, while avoiding topic drift resulting
from query expansion against user generated con-
tent, various authors have proposed to expand the
query against an external corpus, i.e., a corpus dif-
ferent from the target (user generated) corpus from
which documents need to be retrieved.
Our aim in this paper is to define and evaluate
generative models for expanding queries using ex-
ternal collections. We propose a retrieval frame-
work in which dependencies between queries,
documents, and expansion documents are explic-
itly modeled. We instantiate the framework in
multiple ways by making different (in)dependence
assumptions. As one of the instantiations we ob-
tain the mixture of relevance models originally
proposed by Diaz and Metzler (2006).
We address the following research questions:
(i) Can we effectively apply external expansion in
the retrieval of user generated content? (ii) Does
conditioning the external collection on the query
help improve retrieval performance? (iii) Can we
obtain a good estimate of this query-dependent
collection probability? (iv) Which of the collec-
tion, the query, or the document should the selec-
tion of an expansion term be dependent on? In
other words, what are the strongest simplifications
in terms of conditional independencies between
variables that can be assumed, without hurting per-
formance? (v) Do our models show similar behav-
ior across topics or do we observe strong per-topic

Related work comes in two main flavors: (i) query
modeling in general, and (ii) query expansion us-
ing external sources (external expansion). We
start by shortly introducing the general ideas be-
hind query modeling, and continue with a quick

2.1 Query Modeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877777777778">
Query modeling, i.e., transformations of simple
keyword queries into more detailed representa-
tions of the user’s information need (e.g., by as-
signing (different) weights to terms, expanding the
query, or using phrases), is often used to bridge the
vocabulary gap between the query and the doc-
ument collection. Many query expansion tech-
niques have been proposed, and they mostly fall
into two categories, i.e., global analysis and local
analysis. The idea of global analysis is to expand
the query using global collection statistics based,
for instance, on a co-occurrence analysis of the en-
tire collection. Thesaurus- and dictionary-based
expansion as, e.g., in Qiu and Frei (1993), also
provide examples of the global approach.
Our focus in this paper is on local approaches
to query expansion, that use the top retrieved doc-
uments as examples from which to select terms
to improve the retrieval performance (Rocchio,
1971). In the setting of language modeling ap-
proaches to query expansion, the local analysis
idea has been instantiated by estimating addi-
tional query language models (Lafferty and Zhai,
2003; Tao and Zhai, 2006) or relevance mod-
els (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001) from a set of feed-
back documents. Yan and Hauptmann (2007) ex-
plore query expansion in a multimedia setting.
Balog et al. (2008b) compare methods for sam-
pling expansion terms to support query-dependent
and query-independent query expansion; the lat-
ter is motivated by the wish to increase “aspect
recall” and attempts to uncover aspects of the in-
formation need not captured by the query. Kur-
land et al. (2005) also try to uncover multiple as-
pects of a query, and to that they provide an iter-
ative “pseudo-query” generation technique, using
cluster-based language models. The notion of “as-
pect recall” is mentioned in (Buckley, 2004; Har-
man and Buckley, 2004) and identified as one of
the main reasons of failure of the current informa-
tion retrieval systems. Even though we acknowl-
edge the possibilities of our approach in improving
aspect recall, by introducing aspects mainly cov-
ered by the external collection being used, we are
currently unable to test this assumption.

2.2 External Expansion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999674411764706">
The use of external collections for query expan-
sion has a long history, see, e.g., (Kwok et al.,
2001; Sakai, 2002). Diaz and Metzler (2006) were
the first to give a systematic account of query ex-
pansion using an external corpus in a language
modeling setting, to improve the estimation of rel-
evance models. As will become clear in §4, Diaz
and Metzler’s approach is an instantiation of our
general model for external expansion.
Typical query expansion techniques, such as
pseudo-relevance feedback, using a blog or blog
post corpus do not provide significant perfor-
mance improvements and often dramatically hurt
performance. For this reason, query expansion
using external corpora has been a popular tech-
nique at the TREC Blog track (Ounis et al., 2007).
For blog post retrieval, several TREC participants
have experimented with expansion against exter-
nal corpora, usually a news corpus, Wikipedia, the
web, or a mixture of these (Zhang and Yu, 2007;
Java et al., 2007; Ernsting et al., 2008). For the
blog finding task introduced in 2007, TREC par-
ticipants again used expansion against an exter-
nal corpus, usually Wikipedia (Elsas et al., 2008a;
Ernsting et al., 2008; Balog et al., 2008a; Fautsch
and Savoy, 2008; Arguello et al., 2008b). The mo-
tivation underlying most of these approaches is to
improve the estimation of the query representa-
tion, often trying to make up for the unedited na-
ture of the corpus from which posts or blogs need
to be retrieved. Elsas et al. (2008b) go a step fur-
ther and develop a query expansion technique us-
ing the links in Wikipedia.
Finally, Weerkamp and de Rijke (2008b) study

external expansion in the setting of blog retrieval
to uncover additional perspectives of a given topic.
We are driven by the same motivation, but where
they considered rank-based result combinations
and simple mixtures of query models, we take
a more principled and structured approach, and
develop four versions of a generative model for
query expansion using external collections.

3 Retrieval Framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999">
We work in the setting of generative language
models. Here, one usually assumes that a doc-
ument’s relevance is correlated with query likeli-
hood (Ponte and Croft, 1998; Miller et al., 1999;
Hiemstra, 2001). Within the language model-
ing approach, one builds a language model from
each document, and ranks documents based on the
probability of the document model generating the
query. The particulars of the language modeling
approach have been discussed extensively in the
literature (see, e.g., Balog et al. (2008b)) and will
not be repeated here. Our final formula for ranking
documents given a query is based on Eq. 1:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996177">
log P(D|Q) a
log P(D) + X P(t|θQ) log P(t|θD) (1)
tEQ
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999197">
Here, we see the prior probability of a document
being relevant, P(D) (which is independent of the
query Q), the probability of a term t for a given
query model, θQ, and the probability of observ-
ing the term t given the document model, θD.
Our main interest lies in in obtaining a better es-
timate of P(t|θQ). To this end, we take the query
model to be a linear combination of the maximum-
likelihood query estimate P(t|Q) and an expanded
query model P(t |Q):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999974">
P(t|θQ) = λQ - P(t|Q) + (1- λQ) - P(t |Q) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999360666666667">
In the next section we introduce our models for es-
timating p(t |Q), i.e., query expansion using (mul-
tiple) external collections.

4 Query Modeling Approach

<bodyText confidence="0.9996774">
Our goal is to build an expanded query model that
combines evidence from multiple external collec-

where C is the set of document collections.
To estimate the probability of a term given the
query and the collection, P(t|Q, c), we compute
the expectation over the documents in the collec-

P(t|Q, c) = X P(t|Q, c, D) - P(D|Q, c). (4)

X P(c|Q) - X P(t|Q, c, D) - P(D|Q, c).

This, then, is our query model for combining evi-
dence from multiple sources.
The following subsections introduce four in-
stances of the general external expansion model
(EEM) we proposed in this section; each of the in-
stances differ in independence assumptions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.979029133333333">
• EEM1 (§4.1) assumes collection c to be inde-
pendent of query Q and document D jointly,
and document D individually, but keeps the
dependence on Q and of t and Q on D.
• EEM2 (§4.2) assumes that term t and collec-
tion c are conditionally independent, given
document D and query Q; moreover, D and
Q are independent given c but the depen-
dence of t and Q on D is kept.
• EEM3 (§4.3) assumes that expansion term t
and original query Q are independent given
document D.
• On top of EEM3, EEM4 (§4.4) makes one
more assumption, viz. the dependence of col-
lection c on query Q.

of a document, regardless of the collection it ap-
pears in (as we assumed D to be independent of
c). We assume P(D) to be uniform, leading to the
following equation for ranking expansion terms:
We dropped P(Q|c) as it does not influence the

allows us to assign less weight to terms that are
less meaningful in the external collection.

Here, we assume that term t and collection c are
conditionally independent, given document D and

us with the following:

Next, we assume document D and query Q to
be independent given collection c: P(D|Q, c) =

pendence between c and Q (thus P(c|Q) is set to
P(c)). That is, the importance of the external col-
lection is independent of the query. How reason-
able is this choice? Mishne and de Rijke (2006)
examined queries submitted to a blog search en-
gine and found many to be either news-related
context queries (that aim to track mentions of a
named entity) or concept queries (that seek posts
about a general topic). For context queries such as
cheney hunting (TREC topic 867) a news collec-
tion is likely to offer different (relevant) aspects
of the topic, whereas for a concept query such as
jihad (TREC topic 878) a knowledge source such
as Wikipedia seems an appropriate source of terms
that capture aspects of the topic. These observa-
tions suggest the collection should depend on the

5 Estimating Components

The models introduced above offer us several
choices in estimating the main components. Be-
low we detail how we estimate (i) P(c|Q), the
importance of a collection for a given query,
(ii) P(t|c), the unimportance of a term for an ex-
ternal collection, (iii) P(Q|D), the relevance of
a document in the external collection for a given
query, and (iv) P(t, Q|D), the likelihood of a term
co-occurring with the query, given a document.

5.1 Importance of a Collection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999295083333333">
Represented as P(c|Q) in our models, the im-
portance of an external collection depends on the
query; how we can estimate this term? We con-
sider three alternatives, in terms of (i) query clar-
ity, (ii) coherence and (iii) query-likelihood, using
documents in that collection.
First, query clarity measures the structure of a
set of documents based on the assumption that a
small number of topical terms will have unusu-
ally large probabilities (Cronen-Townsend et al.,
2002). We compute the query clarity of the top
ranked documents in a given collection c:

lections, and set P(c|Q) ∝ clc
(rity(
�c0∈c claQ,c0)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993609111111111">
Second, a measure called “coherence score” is
defined by He et al. (2008). It is the fraction of
“coherent” pairs of documents in a given set of
documents, where a coherent document pair is one
whose similarity exceeds a threshold. The coher-
ence of the top ranked documents Rc is:
where S(di, dj) is 1 in case of a similar pair (com-
puted using cosine similarity), and 0 otherwise.
Finally, we set P(c|Q) ∝ Co(Rc)

Third, we compute the conditional probability
of the collection using Bayes’ theorem. We ob-
serve that P(c|Q) ∝ P(Q|c) (omitting P(Q) as it
will not influence the ranking and P(c) which we
take to be uniform). Further, for the sake of sim-
plicity, we assume that all documents within c are
equally important. Then, P(Q|c) is estimated as

(ii) a news collection, and (iii) an online knowl-
edge source. The blog post collection is the TREC
Blog06 collection (Ounis et al., 2007), which con-
tains 3.2 million blog posts from 100,000 blogs
monitored for a period of 11 weeks, from Decem-
ber 2005 to March 2006; all posts from this period
have been stored as HTML files. Our news col-
lection is the AQUAINT-2 collection (AQUAINT-
2, 2007), from which we selected news articles
that appeared in the period covered by the blog

collection, leaving us with about 150,000 news
articles. Finally, we use a dump of the English
Wikipedia from August 2007 as our online knowl-
edge source; this dump contains just over 3.8 mil-
lion encyclopedia articles.
During 2006–2008, the TRECBlog06 collec-
tion has been used for the topical blog post re-
trieval task (Weerkamp and de Rijke, 2008a) at the
TREC Blog track (Ounis et al., 2007): to retrieve
posts about a given topic. For every year, 50 topics
were developed, consisting of a title field, descrip-
tion, and narrative; we use only the title field, and
ignore the other available information. For all 150
topics relevance judgements are available.

We first discuss the parameter tuning for our four
EEM models in Section 7.1. We then report on the
results of applying these settings to obtain our re-
trieval results on the blog post retrieval task. Sec-

7.1 Parameters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976230769231">
Our model has one explicit parameter, and one
more or less implicit parameter. The obvious pa-
rameter is AQ, used in Eq. 2, but also the num-
ber of terms to include in the final query model
makes a difference. For training of the param-
eters we use two TREC topic sets to train and
test on the held-out topic set. From the training
we conclude that the following parameter settings
work best across all topics: (EEM1) AQ = 0.6,
30 terms; (EEM2) AQ = 0.6, 40 terms; (EEM3
and EEM4) AQ = 0.5, 30 terms. In the remainder
of this section, results for our models are reported
using these parameter settings.

ated by EEM1, EEM2, EEM3, and EEM4). For
all models that contain the query-dependent col-
lection probability (P(cJQ)) we report on multi-
ple ways of estimating this: (i) uniform, (ii) best
global mixture (independent of the query, obtained
by a sweep over collection probabilities), (iii) co-
herence, (iv) query clarity, (v) P(QIc), and (vi) us-
ing an oracle for which optimal settings were ob-
tained by the same sweep as (ii). Note that meth-
ods (i) and (ii) are not query dependent; for EEM3
we do not mention (ii) since it equals (i). Finally,
for EEM4 we only have a query-independent com-
ponent, P(c): the best performance here is ob-
tained using equal weights for both collections.
A few observations. First, our baseline per-
forms well above the median for all three years
(2006–2008). Second, in each of its four instances
our model for query expansion against external
corpora improves over the baseline. Third, we
see that it is safe to assume that a term is depen-
dent only on the document from which it is sam-
pled (EEM1 vs. EEM2 vs. EEM3). EEM3 makes
the strongest assumptions about terms in this re-
spect, yet it performs best. Fourth, capturing the
dependence of the collection on the query helps,
as we can see from the significant improvements
of the “oracle” runs over their “uniform” counter-
parts. However, we do not have a good method
yet for automatically estimating this dependence,

Rather than providing a pairwise comparison of all
runs listed in the previous section, we consider two
pairwise comparisons—between (an instantion of)
our model and the baseline, and between two in-
stantiations of our model—and highlight phenom-
ena that we also observed in other pairwise com-
parisons. Based on this discussion, we also con-
sider a combination of approaches.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.919334">
8.1 EEM1 vs. the Baseline
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999421875">
We zoom in on EEM1 and make a per-topic com-
parison against the baseline. First of all, we
observe behavior typical for all query expansion
methods: some topics are helped, some are not af-
fected, and some are hurt by the use of EEM1; see
Figure 1, top row. Specifically, 27 topics show a
slight drop in AP (maximum drop is 0.043 AP), 3
topics do not change (as no expansion terms are
identified) and the remainder of the topics (120)
improve in AP. The maximum increase in AP is
0.5231 (+304%) for topic 949 (ford bell); Top-
ics 887 (world trade organization, +87%), 1032
(I walk the line, +63%), 865 (basque, +53%), and
1014 (tax break for hybrid automobiles, +50%)
also show large improvements. The largest drop (-
20% AP) is for topic 1043 (a million little pieces,
a controversial memoir that was in the news dur-
ing the time coverd by the blog crawl); because we
do not do phrase or entity recognition in the query,
but apply stopword removal, it is reduced to mil-
lion pieces which introduced a lot of topic drift.
Let us examine the “collection preference” of
topics: 35 had a clear preference for Wikipedia, 32
topics for news, and the remainder (83 topics) re-
quired a mixture of both collections. First, we look
at topics that require equal weights for both collec-
tions; topic 880 (natalie portman, +21% AP) con-
cerns a celebrity with a large Wikipedia biography,
as well as news coverage due to new movie re-
leases during the period covered by the blog crawl.
Topic 923 (challenger, +7% AP) asks for infor-
mation on the space shuttle that exploded dur-
ing its launch; the 20th anniversary of this event
was commemorated during the period covered by
the crawl and therefore it is newsworthy as well
as present in Wikipedia (due to its historic im-
pact). Finally, topic 869 (muhammad cartoon,
+20% AP) deals with the controversy surrounding
the publication of cartoons featuring Muhammad:
besides its obvious news impact, this event is ex-
tensively discussed in multiple Wikipedia articles.
As to topics that have a preference for
Wikipedia, we see some very general ones (as is to
be expected): Topic 942 (lawful access, +30% AP)
on the government accessing personal files; Topic
1011 (chipotle restaurant, +13% AP) on infor-
mation concerning the Chipotle restaurants; Topic
938 (plug awards, +21% AP) talks about an award
show. Although this last topic could be expected to
have a clear preference for expansion terms from
the news corpus, the awards were not handed out
during the period covered by the news collection
and, hence, full weight is given to Wikipedia.
At the other end of the scale, topics that show a
preference for the news collection are topic 1042
(david irving, +28% AP), who was on trial dur-
ing the period of the crawl for denying the Holo-
caust and received a lot of media attention. Further
examples include Topic 906 (davos, +20% AP),
which asks for information on the annual world
economic forum meeting in Davos in January,
something typically related to news, and topic 949
(ford bell, +304% AP), which seeks information
on Ford Bell, Senate candidate at the start of 2006.

8.2 EEM1 vs. EEM3
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990476190476">
Next we turn to a comparison between EEM1
and EEM3. Theoretically, the main difference
between these two instantiations of our general
model is that EEM3 makes much stronger sim-
plifying indepence assumptions than EEM1. In
Figure 1 we compare the two, not only against
the baseline, but, more interestingly, also in terms
of the difference in performance brought about by
switching from uniform estimation of P(cjQ) to
oracle estimation. Most topics gain in AP when
going from the uniform distribution to the oracle
setting. This happens for both models, EEM1 and
EEM3, leading to less topics decreasing in AP
over the baseline (the right part of the plots) and
more topics increasing (the left part). A second
observation is that both gains and losses are higher
for EEM3 than for EEM1.
Zooming in on the differences between EEM1
and EEM3, we compare the two in the same way,
now using EEM3 as “baseline” (Figure 2). We ob-
serve that EEM3 performs better than EEM1 in 87

Topics 1041 (federal shield law, 47% AP), 1028
(oregon death with dignity act, 32% AP), and 1032
(I walk the line, 32% AP) have the highest differ-
ence in favor of EEM3; Topics 877 (sonic food in-
dustry, 139% AP), 1013 (iceland european union,
25% AP), and 1002 (wikipedia primary source,
23% AP) are helped most by EEM1. Overall,
EEM3 performs significantly better than EEM1 in
terms of MAP (for α = .05), but not in terms of
the early precision metrics (P5, P10, and MRR).

8.3 Combining Our Approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983866666667">
One observation to come out of §8.1 and 8.2 is that
different topics prefer not only different external
expansion corpora but also different external ex-
pansion methods. To examine this phenomemon,
we created an articificial run by taking, for ev-
ery topic, the best performing model (with settings
optimized for the topic). Twelve topics preferred
the baseline, 37 EEM1, 20 EEM2, and 81 EEM3.
The articifical run produced the following results:
MAP 0.4280, P5 0.7600, P10 0.7480, and MRR
0.8452; the differences in MAP and P10 between
this run and EEM3 are significant for α = .01.
We leave it as future work to (learn to) predict for
a given topic, which approach to use, thus refining
ongoing work on query difficulty prediction.

9 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991709677419">
We explored the use of external corpora for query
expansion in a user generated content setting. We
introduced a general external expansion model,
which offers various modeling choices, and in-
stantiated it based on different (in)dependence as-
sumptions, leaving us with four instances.
Query expansion using external collection is
effective for retrieval in a user generated con-
tent setting. Furthermore, conditioning the collec-
tion on the query is beneficial for retrieval perfor-
mance, but estimating this component remains dif-
ficult. Dropping the dependencies between terms
and collection and terms and query leads to bet-
ter performance. Finally, the best model is topic-
dependent: constructing an artificial run based on
the best model per topic achieves significant better
results than any of the individual models.
Future work focuses on two themes: (i) topic-
dependent model selection and (ii) improved es-
timates of components. As to (i), we first want
to determine whether a query should be expanded,
and next select the appropriate expansion model.
For (ii), we need better estimates of P(Q|c);
one aspect that could be included is taking P(c)
into account in the query-likelihood estimate of
P(Q|c). One can make this dependent on the task
at hand (blog post retrieval vs. blog feed search).
Another possibility is to look at solutions used in
distributed IR. Finally, we can also include the es-
timation of P(D|c), the importance of a document
in the collection.

<abstract confidence="0.999764071428571">User generated content is characterized by short, noisy documents, with many spelling errors and unexpected language usage. To bridge the vocabulary gap between the user’s information need and documents in a specific user generated content environment, the blogosphere, we apply a form of query expansion, i.e., adding and reweighing query terms. Since the blogosphere is noisy, query expansion on the collection itself is rarely effective but external, edited collections are more suitable. We propose a generative model for expanding queries using external collections in which dependencies between queries, documents, and expansion documents are explicitly modeled. Different instantiations of our model are discussed and make different (in)dependence assumptions. Results using two external collections (news and Wikipedia) show that external expansion for retrieval of user generated content is effective; besides, conditioning the external collection on the query is very beneficial, and making candidate expansion terms dependent on just the document seems sufficient.</abstract>

Our focus in this paper is on local approaches to query expansion, that use the top retrieved documents as examples from which to select terms to improve the retrieval performance (Rocchio, 1971). In the setting of language modeling approaches to query expansion, the local analysis idea has been instantiated by estimating additional query language models (Lafferty and Zhai, 2003; Tao and Zhai, 2006) or relevance models (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001) from a set of feedback documents. Yan and Hauptmann (2007) explore query expansion in a multimedia setting. Balog et al. (2008b) compare methods for sampling expansion terms to support query-dependent and query-independent query expansion; the latter is motivated by the wish to increase “aspect recall” and attempts to uncover aspects of the information need not captured by the query. Kurland et al. (2005) also try to uncover multiple aspects of a query, and to that they provide an iterative “pseudo-query” generation technique, using cluster-based language models.

Results using two external collections (news and Wikipedia) show that external expansion for retrieval of user generated content is effective; besides, conditioning the external collection on the query is very beneficial, and making candidate expansion terms dependent on just the document seems sufficient. 1 Introduction One of the grand challenges in information retrieval is to bridge the vocabulary gap between a user and her information need on the one hand and the relevant documents on the other (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). In the setting of blogs or other types of user generated content, bridging this gap becomes even more challenging. This has several causes: (i) the spelling errors, unusual, creative or unfocused language usage resulting from the lack of top-down rules and editors in the content creation process, and (ii) the (often) limited length of user generated documents. Query expansion, i.e., modifying the query by adding and reweighing terms, is an often used technique to bridge the vocabulary gap.

We consider three alternatives, in terms of (i) query clarity, (ii) coherence and (iii) query-likelihood, using documents in that collection. First, query clarity measures the structure of a set of documents based on the assumption that a small number of topical terms will have unusually large probabilities (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002). We compute the query clarity of the top ranked documents in a given collection c: P(t|Q) P(t|Q) · log P (t|Rc) Finally, we normalize clarity(Q, c) over all collections, and set P(c|Q) ∝ clc (rity( �c0∈c claQ,c0) Second, a measure called “coherence score” is defined by He et al. (2008). It is the fraction of “coherent” pairs of documents in a given set of documents, where a coherent document pair is one whose similarity exceeds a threshold. The coherence of the top ranked documents Rc is: where S(di, dj) is 1 in case of a similar pair (computed using cosine similarity), and 0 otherwise. Final</context>

We propose a retrieval framework in which dependencies between queries, documents, and expansion documents are explicitly modeled. We instantiate the framework in multiple ways by making different (in)dependence assumptions. As one of the instantiations we obtain the mixture of relevance models originally proposed by Diaz and Metzler (2006). We address the following research questions: (i) Can we effectively apply external expansion in the retrieval of user generated content? (ii) Does conditioning the external collection on the query help improve retrieval performance? (iii) Can we obtain a good estimate of this query-dependent collection probability?

Diaz and Metzler (2006) were the first to give a systematic account of query expansion using an external corpus in a language modeling setting, to improve the estimation of relevance models. As will become clear in §4, Diaz and Metzler’s approach is an instantiation of our general model for external expansion. Typical query expansion techniques, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, using a blog or blog post corpus do not provide significant performance improvements and often dramatically hurt performance. For this reason, query expansion using external corpora has been a popular technique at the TREC Blog track (Ounis</context>

(11) 4.4 External Expansion Model 4 (EEM4) In this fourth model we start from EEM3 and drop the assumption that c depends on the query Q, i.e., P(c|Q) = P(c), obtaining P(t|�Q) ∝ c∈C X P(c) · X P(t|D) · P(Q|D). (12) |Rc |D∈R� Eq. 12 is in fact the “mixture of relevance models” external expansion model proposed by Diaz and Metzler (2006). The fundamental difference between EEM1, EEM2, EEM3 on the one hand and EEM4 on the other is that EEM4 assumes independence between c and Q (thus P(c|Q) is set to P(c)). That is, the importance of the external collection is independent of the query. How reasonable is this choice? Mishne and de Rijke (2006) examined queries submitted to a blog search engine and found many to be either news-related context queries (that aim to track mentions of a named entity) or concept queries (that seek posts about a general topic).

Here, we take a straightforward approach in estimating this, and define P(t|c) = 1 − n(t,c) Et0 n(t0,c). 5.3 Likelihood of a Query We need an estimate of the probability of a query given a document, P(Q|D). We do so by using Hauff et al. (2008)’s refinement of term dependencies in the query as proposed by Metzler and Croft (2005). 5.4 Likelihood of a Term Estimating the likelihood of observing both the query and a term for a given document P(t, Q|D) is done in a similar way to estimating P(Q|D), but now for t, Q in stead of Q. 6 Experimental Setup In his section we detail our experimental setup: the (external) collections we use, the topic sets and relevance judgements available, and the significance testing we perform. 6.1 Collections and Topics We make use of three collections: (i) a collection of user generated documents (blog po</context>

Here, one usually assumes that a document’s relevance is correlated with query likelihood (Ponte and Croft, 1998; Miller et al., 1999; Hiemstra, 2001). Within the language modeling approach, one builds a language model from each document, and ranks documents based on the probability of the document model generating the query. The particulars of the language modeling approach have been discussed extensively in the literature (see, e.g., Balog et al. (2008b)) and will not be repeated here. Our final formula for ranking documents given a query is based on Eq. 1: log P(D|Q) a log P(D) + X P(t|θQ) log P(t|θD) (1) tEQ Here, we see the prior probability of a document being relevant, P(D) (which is independent of the query Q), the probability of a </context>

Typical query expansion techniques, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, using a blog or blog post corpus do not provide significant performance improvements and often dramatically hurt performance. For this reason, query expansion using external corpora has been a popular technique at the TREC Blog track (Ounis et al., 2007). For blog post retrieval, several TREC participants have experimented with expansion against external corpora, usually a news corpus, Wikipedia, the web, or a mixture of these (Zhang and Yu, 2007; Java et al., 2007; Ernsting et al., 2008). For the blog finding task introduced in 2007, TREC participants again used expansion against an external corpus, usually Wikipedia (Elsas et al., 2008a; Ernsting et al., 2008; Balog et al., 2008a; Fautsch and Savoy, 2008; Arguello et al., 2008b). The motivation underlying most of these approaches is to improve the estimation of the query representation, often trying to make up for the unedited nature of the corpus from which posts or blogs need to be retrieved. Elsas et al. (2008b) go a step further and develop a query expansion technique using the links in Wikipedia.</context>

Thesaurus- and dictionary-based expansion as, e.g., in Qiu and Frei (1993), also provide examples of the global approach. Our focus in this paper is on local approaches to query expansion, that use the top retrieved documents as examples from which to select terms to improve the retrieval performance (Rocchio, 1971). In the setting of language modeling approaches to query expansion, the local analysis idea has been instantiated by estimating additional query language models (Lafferty and Zhai, 2003; Tao and Zhai, 2006) or relevance models (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001) from a set of feedback documents. Yan and Hauptmann (2007) explore query expansion in a multimedia setting. Balog et al. (2008b) compare methods for sampling expansion terms to support query-dependent and query-independent query expansion; the latter is motivated by the wish to increase “aspect recall” and attempts to uncover aspects of the in</context>

The notion of “aspect recall” is mentioned in (Buckley, 2004; Harman and Buckley, 2004) and identified as one of the main reasons of failure of the current information retrieval systems. Even though we acknowledge the possibilities of our approach in improving aspect recall, by introducing aspects mainly covered by the external collection being used, we are currently unable to test this assumption. 2.2 External Expansion The use of external collections for query expansion has a long history, see, e.g., (Kwok et al., 2001; Sakai, 2002). Diaz and Metzler (2006) were the first to give a systematic account of query expansion using an external corpus in a language modeling setting, to improve the estimation of relevance models. As will become clear in §4, Diaz and Metzler’s approach is an instantiation of our general model for external expansion. Typical query expansion techniques, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, using a blog or blog post corpus do not provide significant performance improvements and often dramatically hurt performance. For this reason, query expansion using external corpora has been a popular technique at t</context>

Typical query expansion techniques, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, using a blog or blog post corpus do not provide significant performance improvements and often dramatically hurt performance. For this reason, query expansion using external corpora has been a popular technique at the TREC Blog track (Ounis et al., 2007). For blog post retrieval, several TREC participants have experimented with expansion against external corpora, usually a news corpus, Wikipedia, the web, or a mixture of these (Zhang and Yu, 2007; Java et al., 2007; Ernsting et al., 2008). For the blog finding task introduced in 2007, TREC participants again used expansion against an external corpus, usually Wikipedia (Elsas et al., 2008a; Ernsting et al., 2008; Balog et al., 2008a; Fautsch and Savoy, 2008; Arguello et al., 2008b). The motivation underlying most of these approaches is to improve the estimation of the query representation, often trying to make up for the unedited nature of the corpus from which posts or blogs need to be retrieved.
