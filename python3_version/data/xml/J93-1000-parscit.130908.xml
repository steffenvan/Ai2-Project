Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999982333333333">
The papers in this two-volume special issue on &amp;quot;using large corpora&amp;quot; bear witness to
promising developments in computational linguistics. Empirical and statistical meth-
ods offer new means of organizing data and attaining insights into our use of language.
From a practical point of view, they provide a basis for progress in the performance
of NLP systems. This collection of papers represents the diversity of work on these
new methods and their application to a range of problems. They offer partial solutions
to the key issues of acquisition, coverage, robustness, and extensibility. What they all
have in common is that the models they employ arise from the use of large collections
of texts for training, organization of data, and evaluating success.

Background to This Issue
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943">
When the idea first arose to publish a special issue of CL on using large corpora, the
topic was not generally considered to be part of mainstream CL, in spite of an active
community working in this field. The rapidly increasing number of papers devoted to
this topic were not yet circulating in the public domain, and large text collections were
not easily obtainable. One commonly held view was that this was a rather marginal
activity, limited to specific applications and only pursued in a few centers, and the few
papers that were in wide circulation were often viewed with skepticism. On the other
hand, a growing number of researchers had recognized the potential of exploiting
large corpora and were making considerable progress in developing new methods
and demonstrating practical results. The first motivation for devoting a special issue
to this topic was thus to bring the numerous and diverse studies based on corpora to
the entire CL community.
Since the call was first published, the corpus-based approach has established itself
as an important development in CL. The interest in this new direction has become ap-
parent in the number of papers, invited talks, and tutorial sessions now commonplace
at NLP conferences and the number of workshops and meetings devoted entirely to
this topic.
What is it that has brought about this rapid growth of interest in corpus-based
NLP? For some, it is simply a rediscovery of empirical and statistical methods popular
in the 1950s. Machine translation, for example, was at that time viewed as a &apos;mere&apos;
decoding problem, but computing resources were far from adequate for processing
the data according to this model. The technological advances in computer power has
certainly favored the reintroduction of this approach, as has the growing availability
of large-scale textual resources in machine-readable form.1

More important, perhaps, is the growing frustration of trying to use standard rule-
based methods to account for more than a well-chosen fragment of text, regardless
of the application. The data extracted from large corpora have demonstrated that lan-
guage use is more flexible and complex than that which most rule-based systems have
up to present tried to account for. The relative lack of practical results at a time when
industrial concerns are looking to the CL community to demonstrate progress toward
useful applications has also contributed to the growing interest in new methods. And
finally, the success rate demonstrated in the speech community offers hope for similar
progress in NLP.
Themes and Topics
The new data-oriented methods offer potential solutions to key problems:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94990425">
• acquisition: automatically identifying and coding all of the necessary
information
• coverage: accounting for all of the phenomena in a given domain,
collection of texts, application, etc.
• robustness: accommodating &apos;real data&apos; that may be corrupt or not
accounted for in the model
• extensibility: applying the model and data to a new domain, a new set of
texts, a new problem, etc.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987412703703704">
While these problems are not new, the exploitation of corpora offers new direc-
tions in which solutions may be sought. Aspects of these topics are addressed in the
papers in various ways: learning word patterns (i.e., subcategorization, collocations,
translation) from their appearance in the texts, improving robustness, and adaptabil-
ity to new domains. A theme to be found in a number of the papers that indirectly
touches on the problems listed above is which methods are appropriate for the task
at hand. A topic related to this is the question of which types of information we
can characterize using statistical methods. In terms of traditional categories these two
volumes contain papers on lexical issues (including morphology and syntactic and
semantic relations), issues in syntax (such as incorporating probability measures in
parsing and discussing attachment problems), and translation topics (from building
tools for alignment to models for fully automatic MT).
A last topic to be addressed with regard to this issue and the use of data-oriented
methods in general is the numerous contrasts and controversies arising in the discus-
sions. The debate has been characterized in terms of &apos;statistics-based vs. rule-based,&apos;
&apos;empirical vs. rationalist,&apos; Chomsky-inspired vs. Shannon-inspired,&apos; etc.&apos; To those not
directly engaged in this debate, however, such matters may seem of secondary interest.
Many of the papers that directly address this topic in these two volumes demonstrate
how the two approaches can be combined, rather than arguing for one in opposition
to the other. As stated at the beginning, my purpose in putting together this special
issue has been to identify new methods and describe the potential results that the use
of large corpora offers us.
ELSNET, and other European institutions), and the creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium have
helped to make a growing collection of data widely available.

discussion into a historical context and provides a personal perspective on some of the underlying
issues.
