Sometimes philosophers and linguists say things that
are of interest to computer scientists or would be of
interest if properly explained. Unfortunately, philo-
sophical work and theoretical linguistics are seldom
explained in ways that make them seem relevant to
computer scientists. That is, they are seldom explained
in ways that suggest directions for future research.
Given this communication problem, there is a definite
need for a volume that can bring together some of the
best work in the philosophy of language, linguistics, and
natural language processing, and show how work in the
philosophy of language and linguistics has been and can
be applied to problems in natural language processing.
Unfortunately, despite the title&apos; and the promotional
literature, this volume does not fulfil the need. Part of
the problem is that none of the papers in the volume
describe work in which the theoretical insights of phi-
losophers and linguists are implemented. There are
simply no papers on natural language processing. There
is an introduction by Kulas that is supposed to show
why these essays are important to Al researchers. But
while the introduction occasionally provides reasonable
summaries of the essays, it doesn&apos;t come close to
suggesting applications of the theoretical work to Al. It
may well be that computer scientists ought to be famil-
iar with the essays in the book. Most of the essays are,
after all, classics. But it is pedagogically naive to think
that one can drop, for example, Davidson&apos;s &amp;quot;Truth and
Meaning&amp;quot; in the lap of a computer scientist and suppose
that it suggests anything in the way of a research
program.
Another part of the problem is that the volume has
been limited to papers that originally appeared in books
or journals published by D. Reidel. This is unfortunate,
for a number of sections of the book could have been
greatly strengthened with the addition of material pub-
lished elsewhere. Now it may be that the editors in-
tended to provide something like &amp;quot;D. Reidel&apos;s Greatest
Hits&amp;quot;, but such a strategy seems to me misguided.
There is nothing intrinsically interesting about the fact
that a paper was first published in a Reidel journal. It
may be that the move was inspired by the desire to hold
down costs,2 but if the editors were successful in
holding down costs, the savings certainly were not
passed along to the customer. The price of the 12-essay
volume is $99!
Thus far my comments have been strong, but gen-
eral. I think a section-by-section discussion of the book
may be in order, to point out specific concerns and to
suggest ways in which the collection might have been
improved.
The book begins with a prologue entitled &amp;quot;Modes of
Meaning&amp;quot;, which contains Grice&apos;s &amp;quot;Utterer&apos;s Meaning,
Sentence Meaning, and Word Meaning&amp;quot;—a great pa-
per, but what it is supposed to suggest to the Al
researcher is unclear. Nor is Kulas&apos;s introduction much
help here, as he offers only a one-sentence summary of
the paper.
Part 1 of the book is entitled &amp;quot;Formal Syntax of
Natural Language&amp;quot;, but is really about the question of
whether natural languages are context-free. The first
essay has no place in this volume. It is a short piece that
Pullum wrote as a &amp;quot;Topic . . . comment&amp;quot; column for
Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, which at-
tempts to sort out who was the first to show that natural
language is not context-free. The piece is not, nor do I
believe it intended to be, a serious piece of academic
research. (Pullum has even expressed amusement that
&amp;quot;Topic. . . comment&amp;quot; columns have been indexed and
abstracted.)3 This is not a criticism of Pullum; he has
other work on the problem of the context-freeness of
natural language (e.g., Pullum 1983) that would have
made much better additions to the volume. For that
matter, Gazdar and Pullum (1985) would also have been
a better choice. The second piece in Part 1 is Shieber&apos;s
&amp;quot;Evidence Against the Context Freeness of Natural
Language&amp;quot;, which is a solid piece showing how Swiss-
German is weakly non–context-free. But Shieber would
be the first to admit that the implications of the result for
natural language processing are of no great moment.
Part 2 of the collection is entitled &amp;quot;Semantic Aspects
of Natural Language&amp;quot; and contains Davidson&apos;s &amp;quot;Truth
and Meaning&amp;quot; and Hintikka&apos;s &amp;quot;Semantics for Proposi-
tional Attitudes&amp;quot;. I&apos;ve already noted that the import of
Davidson&apos;s paper (which makes no concessions to the
non-philosopher) is never made clear. As for Hintikka&apos;s
paper, it isn&apos;t really about semantics, but is an applica-
tion of possible-world semantics to the problem of the
attitudes. It more properly belongs with the Perry and
Stalnalcer papers in Part 5. What is unfortunate about
this part of the collection is that there really has been
confusion between philosophers and computer scien-
tists about what semantics is—a confusion that could
have been straightened out here. Most computer scien-

tists construe the semantics of a term as a data structure
that represents conceptual dependencies of the term.
But philosophers (e.g., Putnam 1975) take semantics to
be about how the terms hook up with the world. For
Putnam and others meanings just aren&apos;t in the head. So,
strictly speaking, you can&apos;t implement a semantics, for
semantics describes the relationship between states of
your machine and the world.
Part 3 is entitled &amp;quot;Connecting Syntax with Seman-
tics&amp;quot;, and begins with Montague&apos;s &amp;quot;The Proper Treat-
ment of Quantification in Ordinary English&amp;quot;. The paper
does, of course, speak to the relationship between
syntax and semantics, though it could perhaps be in-
cluded in a section called &amp;quot;Doing Away with Syntax&amp;quot;.
Computer scientists are generally aware of Montague&apos;s
work, and they generally regard it as computationally
intractable (e.g., see Hirst 1987, P. 32). There is no
mention of this in the introduction, however, nor is
there a discussion of attempts to implement versions of
Montague grammar. Friedman, Moran, and Warren
(1978a, 1978b) should be discussed if not included, but
the work doesn&apos;t even make the bibliography.
The second piece in this section is Gazdar&apos;s &amp;quot;Phrase
Structure Grammar&amp;quot;. While there is a standard line
about applying Montague&apos;s semantics to GPSG, this
particular paper does not provide the best statement of
the relationship. Moreover, Gazdar&apos;s position on the
relationship between syntax and semantics is essentially
the same as Montague&apos;s. Both think that there is an
isomorphism between syntax and semantics, the chief
difference being that Montague employs a categorial
grammar syntax while Gazdar employs GPSG. The
back-to-back appearance of these papers gives the
impression that this view is uncontroversial, but nothing
could be further from the truth. Higginbotham, to name
one philosopher with reservations about Montague&apos;s
program, is discussed in the introduction, but Higgin-
botham (1985) really ought to be included in a collection
of this nature.
In my opinion the Gazdar paper (which is fine as an
introduction to GPSG) really belongs in the section
entitled &amp;quot;Formal Syntax of Natural Language&amp;quot;, but
that heading apparently meant something else to the
editors. One also has to wonder why, if a paper on
GPSG is to be included, there is nothing on LFG, which
has been at least as important as GPSG in natural
language processing. Moreover, since GB is the most
widely employed linguistic theory and has driven NLP
research by Berwick and others in MIT&apos;s Al lab, one
wonders why it is not represented in the collection.
Part 4, &amp;quot;Natural Language and Logical Form&amp;quot;, con-
tains two important essays; Barwise and Cooper&apos;s
&amp;quot;Generalized Quantifiers and Natural Language&amp;quot;, and
Hintikka&apos;s &amp;quot;Quantifiers in Natural Language: Some
Logical Problems I&amp;quot;. They are important, but important
in pointing out the limits of first-order theories of
quantification in accounting for the semantics of natural
language. The implications of this for Al are never made
clear. Moreover, one might suppose that computer
scientists will not be concerned if their parsers cannot
handle Hintikka branching constructions like Some
product of some subdivision of every company of every
conglomerate is advertised in some page of some
number of every magazine of every newspaper chain.
The nature of the logical form of natural language is a
much broader problem than these two essays alone
suggest. This is attested to by work on logical form done
within the GB framework and by extensive work in the
Davidsonian tradition. Again, the essays included here
are excellent, but they belong in a section on non-
elementary quantification or on the limits of first-order
quantified logic.
Part 5, &amp;quot;Possible Worlds and Situation Semantics&amp;quot;,
contains essays by Stalnaker and Perry in which they
debate (among other things) whether possible worlds or
situations provide objects of the appropriate granularity
for the purposes of semantics. Together they supply
some much-needed clarification to the debate between
possible-world semantics and situation semantics.
However, the consequences of the debate for AI are far
from obvious, and go unexplained.
The epilogue, &amp;quot;From Semantics to Pragmatics&amp;quot;,
contains Kamp&apos;s &amp;quot;Semantics vs. Pragmatics&amp;quot;, an essay
that Kulas summarizes in one sentence as being about
&amp;quot;the ebb and flow of ordinary conversations in ordinary
language&amp;quot;. I, on the other hand, took the essay to be
providing a formal pragmatic theory of the illocutionary
force of commands and permission statements.
The upshot is that the collection would more appro-
priately have been titled Formal Philosophy of Lan-
guage, but even as a collection in the philosophy of
language it is poorly structured and contains some
significant gaps. This is not to criticize the individual
papers. As I noted earlier, they are almost all classics.
However, they are also readily available in other places.
Why is &amp;quot;artificial intelligence&amp;quot; in the title? Probably for
marketing reasons. Few philosophers or linguists can
afford to lay out $99.00 for a book. One final note: The
advertisements for the book and the note on the back
cover suggest that work on discourse representation
theory is covered, but this is simply not the case.

2. Not only was the need to pay royalties avoided, but typesetting
expenses seem to have been spared as well. For the most part the
essays appear as they were originally typeset, pagination being
the only change. This policy is unfortunate, for mistakes have
surfaced in some of these writings which ought to be noted in
editorial footnotes, if not corrected. For example, there is a slip in
Montague&apos;s paper which is reprinted without mention here (the
first meaning postulate on p. 157 contains a biconditional instead
of a conditional—fine in the case of intransitive verbs, but not for
common nouns). This &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; has infested some implementations
of Montague grammar.

In thinking about the problem of generating English
sentences, it is very reasonable to wonder whether the
natural paradigm of the solution is not perhaps that of
planning or problem solving. (I use the terms here
interchangeably; the distinctions between the two en-
terprises are small enough to be ignored in this context.)
That is to say, given that you start with some specific
state, namely the input, and want to end with some
other state, the corresponding sentence, and you have a
set of rules, namely the grammar, that prescribe how to
bring about the change, then why not simply use a
planner or problem solver to do the job?
This is exactly what Terry Patten&apos;s book is about. It
does not address all the issues involved, but it shows
convincingly that you can implement a sentence gener-
ator in the problem-solving paradigm and it provides as
well some very useful information on systemic gram-
mar: both a formal definition of systemic networks and
a description of a particular implementation of one.
The book consists of three parts: introductory mate-
rial, the core idea, and the rest. The introductory
material contains a chapter describing Al problem solv-
ing and a chapter describing systemic grammar. The
core material first describes how one can interpret a
grammar as information with which one can perform
problem solving, and then provides a formal model of
systemic grammar. In the remainder, a particular imple-
mentation of a problem solver using systemic grammar,
called SLANG, is described and compared with other
generators, and parts of SLANG&apos;s grammar and sam-
ples of its output are provided.
Chapter 3, the background chapter describing sys-
temic grammar, is a simple introduction to a body of
thought that often has been called impenetrable. Given
the breadth of application of systemic linguistics, an
understanding of it is required for anyone who wishes to
venture beyond the narrow view of language as taken by
the various generative paradigms. Since it focuses on
implementational issues, this chapter offers, specially
tailored for the computational linguistics community,
one of the most readable descriptions of the systemic
view of language I have yet encountered. Unfortu-
nately, this fact makes the chapter less suitable as a
general overview of the field, since it gives no indication
of the depth of linguistic research that underlies the
ideas it describes.
Chapter 4 leads the reader through the correspon-
dences between problem solving, which is a search
process through a space of alternative states, and sys-
temic language generation, which is a search process
through a network of alternative meanings (i.e., aspects
of sentences). The network&apos;s grammatical choice
points, called systems, are implemented by production
rules. lin the way illustrated, AI techniques for handling
huge spaces of interdependent alternatives efficiently
can be applied to fine-grained grammatical distinctions
identified by systemic (or other functional) linguists.
Chapter 5 contains a somewhat exploratory formal

It is a short piece that Pullum wrote as a &amp;quot;Topic . . . comment&amp;quot; column for Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, which attempts to sort out who was the first to show that natural language is not context-free. The piece is not, nor do I believe it intended to be, a serious piece of academic research. (Pullum has even expressed amusement that &amp;quot;Topic. . . comment&amp;quot; columns have been indexed and abstracted.)3 This is not a criticism of Pullum; he has other work on the problem of the context-freeness of natural language (e.g., Pullum 1983) that would have made much better additions to the volume. For that matter, Gazdar and Pullum (1985) would also have been a better choice. The second piece in Part 1 is Shieber&apos;s &amp;quot;Evidence Against the Context Freeness of Natural Language&amp;quot;, which is a solid piece showing how SwissGerman is weakly non–context-free. But Shieber would be the first to admit that the implications of the result for natural language processing are of no great moment. Part 2 of the collection is entitled &amp;quot;Semantic Aspects of Natural Language&amp;quot; and contains Davidson&apos;s &amp;quot;Truth and Meaning&amp;quot; and Hintikka&apos;s &amp;quot;Semantics for Pro</context>

What is unfortunate about this part of the collection is that there really has been confusion between philosophers and computer scientists about what semantics is—a confusion that could have been straightened out here. Most computer scien124 Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 2, June 1989 Book Reviews Philosophy, Language, and Artificial Intelligence: Resources for Processing Natural Language tists construe the semantics of a term as a data structure that represents conceptual dependencies of the term. But philosophers (e.g., Putnam 1975) take semantics to be about how the terms hook up with the world. For Putnam and others meanings just aren&apos;t in the head. So, strictly speaking, you can&apos;t implement a semantics, for semantics describes the relationship between states of your machine and the world. Part 3 is entitled &amp;quot;Connecting Syntax with Semantics&amp;quot;, and begins with Montague&apos;s &amp;quot;The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English&amp;quot;. The paper does, of course, speak to the relationship between syntax and semantics, though it could perhaps be included in a section called &amp;quot;Doing Away with Syntax&amp;quot;.
