The TUNA-REG’09 Challenge was one
of the shared-task evaluation competitions
at Generation Challenges 2009. TUNA-
REG’09 used data from the TUNA Cor-
pus of paired representations of enti-
ties and human-authored referring expres-
sions. The shared task was to create sys-
tems that generate referring expressions
for entities given representations of sets
of entities and their properties. Four
teams submitted six systems to TUNA-
REG’09. We evaluated the six systems and
two sets of human-authored referring ex-
pressions using several automatic intrinsic
measures, a human-assessed intrinsic eval-
uation and a human task performance ex-
periment. This report describes the TUNA-
REG task and the evaluation methods used,
and presents the evaluation results.

This year’s run of the TUNA-REG Shared-Task
Evaluation Competition (STEC) is the third, and
final, competition to involve the TUNA Corpus of
referring expressions. The TUNA Corpus was first
used in the Pilot Attribute Selection for Gener-
ating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge
(Belz and Gatt, 2007) which took place between
May and September 2007; and again for three of
the shared tasks in Referring Expression Genera-
tion (REG) Challenges 2008, which ran between
September 2007 and May 2008 (Gatt et al., 2008).
This year’s TUNA Task replicates one of the three
tasks from REG’08, the TUNA-REG Task. It uses
the same test data, to enable direct comparison
against the 2008 results. Four participating teams
submitted 6 different systems this year; teams and
their affiliations are shown in Table 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999970814814815">
Each file in the TUNA corpus1 consists of a sin-
gle pairing of a domain (a representation of 7 en-
tities and their attributes) and a human-authored
description for one of the entities (the target refer-
ent). Some domains represent sets of people, some
represent items of furniture (see also Table 2). The
descriptions were collected in an online elicita-
tion experiment which was advertised mainly on
a website hosted at the University of Zurich Web
Experimentation List2 (a web service for recruit-
ing subjects for experiments), and in which partic-
ipation was not controlled or monitored. In the
experiment, participants were shown pictures of
the entities in the given domain and were asked to
type a description of the target referent (which was
highlighted in the visual display). The main condi-
tion3 manipulated in the experiment was +/−LOC:
in the +LOC condition, participants were told that
they could refer to entities using any of their prop-
erties (including their location on the screen). In
the −LOC condition, they were discouraged from
doing so, though not prevented.
The XML format we have been using in the
TUNA-REG STECs, shown in Figure 1, is a vari-
ant of the original format of the TUNA corpus.

3The elicitation experiment had an additional independent
variable, manipulating whether descriptions were elicited in a
‘fault-critical’ or ‘non-fault-critical’ condition. For the shared
tasks this was ignored by collapsing all the data in these two
conditions.

tion. The DOMAIN node contains 7 ENTITY nodes,
which themselves contain a number of ATTRIBUTE
nodes defining the possible properties of an en-
tity in attribute-value notation. The attributes in-
clude properties such as an object’s colour or
a person’s clothing, and the location of the im-
age in the visual display which the DOMAIN rep-
resents. Each ENTITY node indicates whether it
is the target referent or one of the six distrac-
tors, and also has a pointer to the image that it
represents. The WORD-STRING is the actual de-
scription typed by one of the human authors, the
ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING is the description with
substrings annotated with the attributes they re-
alise, while the ATTRIBUTE-SET contains the set of
attributes only. The ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING and
ATTRIBUTE-SET nodes were provided in the train-
ing and development data only, to show how sub-
strings of a human-authored description mapped
to attributes.

Apart from differences in the XML format, the
data used in the TUNA-REG Task also differs from
the original TUNA corpus in that it has only the sin-
gular referring expressions from the original cor-
pus, and in that we have added to it the files of
images of entities that the XML mark-up points to.
The test set, which was constructed for the
2008 run of the TUNA-REG Task, consists of 112
items, each with a different domain paired with
two human-authored descriptions. The items are
distributed equally between furniture items and
people, and between both experimental conditions
(+/ − LOC). In the following sections, the two
sets of human descriptions will be referred to as
HUMAN-1 and HUMAN-2.4 The numbers of files
in the training, development and test sets, as well
as in the people and furniture subdomains, are

3 The TUNA-REG Task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999761194444445">
Referring Expression Generation (REG) has been
the subject of intensive research in the NLG com-
munity, giving rise to substantial consensus on the
problem definition, as well as the nature of the in-
puts and outputs of REG algorithms. Typically,
such algorithms take as input a domain, consist-
ing of entities and their attributes, together with an
indication of which is the intended referent, and
output a set of attributes true of the referent which
distinguish it from other entities in the domain.
The TUNA-REG task adds an additional stage (re-
alisation) in which selected attributes are mapped
to a natural language expression (usually a noun
phrase). Realisation has received far less attention
among REG researchers than attribute selection.
The TUNA-REG task is an ‘end-to-end’ refer-
ring expression generation task, in the sense that
it takes as input a representation of a set of enti-
ties and their properties, and outputs a word string
which describes the target entity. Participating
systems were not constrained to have attribute se-
lection as a separate module from realisation.
In terms of the XML format, the items in
the test set distributed to participants consisted
of a DOMAIN node and ATTRIBUTE-SET, and par-
ticipating systems had to generate appropriate
WORD-STRINGs.
As with previous STECs involving the TUNA
data, we deliberately refrained from including in
the task definition any aim that would imply as-
sumptions about quality (as would be the case if
we had asked participants to aim to produce, say,
minimal or uniquely distinguishing referring ex-
pressions), and instead we simply listed the evalu-
ation criteria that were going to be used (described
in Section 5).

This section briefly describes this year’s submis-
sions. Full descriptions of participating systems
can be found in the participants’ reports included
in this volume.
IS: The submission of the IS team, IS-FP-GT, is
based on the idea that different writers use differ-
ent styles of referring expressions, and that, there-
fore, knowing the identity of the writer helps gen-
erate REs similar to those in the corpus. The
attribute-selection algorithm is an extended full-
brevity algorithm which uses a nearest neighbour
technique to select the attribute set (AS) most sim-
ilar to a given writer’s previous ASs, or, in a case
where no ASs by the given writer have previously
been seen, to select the AS that has the highest de-
gree of similarity with all previously seen ASs by
any writer. If multiple ASs remain, the algorithm
first selects the shortest, then the most represen-
tative of the remaining REs, then the AS with the
highest-frequency attributes. Individualised statis-
tical models are used to convert the selected AS
into a surface-syntactic dependency tree which is
then converted to a word stirng with an existing
realiser.
GRAPH: The GRAPH team reused their existing
graph-based attribute selection component, which
represents a domain as a weighted graph, and uses
a cost function for attributes. The team devel-
oped a new realiser which uses a set of templates
derived from the descriptions in the TUNA cor-
pus. In order to build templates, certain subsets
of attributes were grouped together, individual at-
tributes were replaced by their type, and a pre-
ferred order for attributes was determined based
on frequencies of orderings. During realisation,
if a matching template exists, types are replaced
with the most frequent word string for each given
attribute; if no match exists, realisation is done by
a simple rule-based method.
NIL-UCM: The three systems submitted by this
group use a standard evolutionary algorithm for
attribute selection where genotypes consist of
binary-valued genes each representing the pres-
ence or absence of a given attribute. Realisation
is done with a case-based reasoning (CBR) method
which retrieves the most similar previously seen
ASs for an input AS, in order of their similarity
to the input. (Sub)strings are then copied from
the preferred retrieved case to create the output
word string. One system, NIL-UCM-EvoCBR uses
both components as described above. The other
two systems, NIL-UCM-ValuesCBR and NIL-UCM-
EvoTAP, replace one of the components with the
team’s corresponding component from REG’08.
USP: The system submitted by this group, USP-
EACH, is a frequency-based greedy attribute se-
lection strategy which takes into account the +/ −
LOC attribute in the TUNA data. Realisation was
done using the surface realiser supplied to partici-
pants in the ASGRE’07 Challenge.

5 Evaluation Methods and Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999978466666667">
We used a range of different evaluation methods,
including intrinsic and extrinsic,5 automatically
computed and human-evaluated, as shown in the
overview in Table 3. Participants computed auto-
matic intrinsic evaluation scores on the develop-
ment set (using the teval program provided by
us). We performed all of the evaluations shown
in Table 3 on the test data set. For all measures,
results were computed both (a) overall, using the
entire test data set, and (b) by entity type, that is,
computing separate values for outputs in the furni-
ture and in the people domain. Evaluation meth-
ods for each evaluation type and corresponding
evaluation results are presented in the following
three sections.

string-edit distance, BLEU-3 and NIST-5. Accu-
racy measures the percentage of cases where a
system’s output word string was identical to the
corresponding description in the corpus. String-
edit distance (SE) is the classic Levenshtein dis-
tance measure and computes the minimal number
of insertions, deletions and substitutions required
to transform one string into another. We set the
cost for insertions and deletions to 1, and that for
substitutions to 2. If two strings are identical, then
this metric returns 0 (perfect match). Otherwise
the value depends on the length of the two strings
(the maximum value is the sum of the lengths). As
an aggregate measure, we compute the mean of
pairwise SE scores.
BLEU-x is an n-gram based string comparison
measure, originally proposed by Papineni et al.
(2001; 2002) for evaluation of Machine Transla-
tion systems. It computes the proportion of word
n-grams of length x and less that a system out-
put shares with several reference outputs. Setting
x = 4 (i.e. considering all n-grams of length ≤ 4)
is standard, but because many of the TUNA de-
scriptions are shorter than 4 tokens, we compute
BLEU-3 instead. BLEU ranges from 0 to 1.
NIST is a version of BLEU, but where BLEU
gives equal weight to all n-grams, NIST gives more
importance to less frequent n-grams, which are
taken to be more informative. The maximum NIST
score depends on the size of the test set.
Unlike string-edit distance, BLEU and NIST are
by definition aggregate measures (i.e. a single
score is obtained for a peer system based on the
entire set of items to be compared, and this is not
generally equal to the average of scores for indi-
vidual items).
Because the test data has two human-authored
reference descriptions per domain, the Accuracy
and SE scores had to be computed slightly differ-
ently to obtain test data scores (whereas BLEU and
NIST are designed for multiple reference texts).
For the test data only, therefore, Accuracy ex-
presses the percentage of a system’s outputs that
match at least one of the reference outputs, and SE
is the average of the two pairwise scores against
the reference outputs.
Results: Table 4 is an overview of the self-
reported scores on the development set included in
the participants’ reports (not all participants report
Accuracy scores). The corresponding scores for
the test data set as well as NIST scores for the test
data (all computed by us), are shown in Table 5.
The table also includes the result of comparing
the two sets of human descriptions, HUMAN-1 and
HUMAN-2, to each other using the same metrics
(their scores are distinct only for non-commutative
measures, i.e. NIST and BLEU).
We ran6 a one-way ANOVA for the SE scores.

There was a main effect of SYSTEM on SE (F =

with α = .05 revealed a number of significant dif-
ferences: all systems were significantly better than
the human-authored descriptions, and GRAPH was
furthermore significantly better than NIL-UCM-
EvoCBR.
We also computed the Kruskal-Wallis H value
for the systems’ individual Accuracy scores, using
a chi square test to establish significance. By this
test, the observed aggregate difference among the
seven systems is significant at the .01 level (χ27 =

5.2 Human intrinsic evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97146488607595">
The TUNA’09 Challenge was the first TUNA
shared-task competition to include an intrinsic
evaluation involving human judgments of quality.
Design: The intrinsic human evaluation in-
volved descriptions for all 112 test data items from
all six submitted systems, as well as from the two
sets of human-authored descriptions.7 Thus, each
of the 112 test set items was associated with 8
different descriptions. We used a Repeated Latin
Squares design which ensures that each subject
sees descriptions from each system and for each
domain the same number of times. There were
fourteen 8 × 8 squares, and a total of 896 indi-
vidual judgments in this evaluation, each system
receiving 112 judgments (14 from each subject).
Procedure: In each of the 112 trials, par-
ticipants were shown a system output (i.e. a
WORD-STRING), together with its corresponding
domain, displayed as the set of corresponding im-
ages on the screen.8 The intended (target) referent
was highlighted by a red frame surrounding it on
the screen. They were asked to give two ratings
in answer to the following questions (the first for
Adequacy, the second for Fluency):
1. How clear is this description? Try to imagine
someone who could see the same grid with
the same pictures, but didn’t know which of
the pictures was the target. How easily would
they be able to find it, based on the phrase
given?
7Note that we refer to all outputs, whether human or
system-generated, as system outputs in what follows.
8The on-screen display of images was very similar, al-
though not identical, to that in the original TUNA elicitation
experiments.
2. How fluent is this description? Here your
task is to judge how well the phrase reads.
Is it good, clear English?
We did not use a rating scale (where integers
correspond to different assessments of quality),
because it is not generally considered appropriate
to apply parametric methods of analysis to ordinal
data. Instead, we asked subjects to give their judg-
ments for Adequacy and Fluency for each item by
manipulating a slider like this:
The slider pointer was placed in the center at the
beginning of each trial, as shown above. The posi-
tion of the slider selected by the subject mapped to
an integer value between 1 and 100. However, the
scale was not visible to participants, whose task
was to move the pointer to the left or right. The
further to the right, the more positive the judgment
(and the higher the value returned); the further to
the left, the more negative.
Following instructions, subjects did two prac-
tice examples, followed by the 112 test items in
random order. Subjects carried out the experi-
ment over the internet, at a time and place of their
choosing, and were allowed to interrupt and re-
sume the experiment. According to self-reported
timings, subjects took between 25 and 60 minutes
to complete the experiment (not counting breaks).
Participants: We recruited eight native speak-
ers of English from among post-graduate students
currently doing a Masters degree in a linguistics-
related subject.9
We recorded subjects’ gender, level of educa-
tion, field of study, proficiency in English, vari-
ety of English and colour vision. Since all sub-
jects were native English speakers, had normal
colour vision, and had comparable levels of ed-
ucation and academic backgrounds, as indicated
above, these variables are not included in the anal-
yses reported below.
Results: Table 6 displays the mean Fluency and
Adequacy judgments obtained by each system.

5.3 Extrinsic task-performance evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999491431818182">
As for earlier shared tasks involving the TUNA
data, we carried out a task-performance experi-
ment in which subjects have the task of identifying
intended referents.
Design: The extrinsic human evaluation in-
volved descriptions for all 112 test data items from
all six submitted systems, as well as from the two
sets of human-authored descriptions. We used a
Repeated Latin Squares design with fourteen 8×8
squares, so again there were a total of 896 individ-
ual judgments and each system received 112 judg-
ments, however this time it was 7 from each sub-
ject, as there were 16 participants; so half the par-
ticipants did the first 56 items (the first 7 squares),
and the other half the second 56 (the remaining 7
squares).
Procedure: In each of their 5 practice trials and
56 real trials, participants were shown a system
output (i.e. a WORD-STRING), together with its cor-
responding domain, displayed as the set of corre-
sponding images on the screen. In this experiment
the intended referent was not highlighted in the on-
screen display, and the participants’ task was to
identify the intended referent among the pictures
by mouse-clicking on it.10
In previous TUNA identification experiments
(Belz and Gatt, 2007; Gatt et al., 2008), sub-
jects had to read the description before identify-
ing the intended referent. In ASGRE’07 both de-
scription and pictures were displayed at the same
time, yielding a single time measure that com-
bined reading and identification times. In REG’08,
subjects first read the description and then called
up the pictures on the screen when they had fin-
ished reading the description, which yielded sepa-
rate reading and identification times.
10Due to limitations related to the stimulus presentation
software, the images in this experiment were displayed in
strict rows and columns, whereas the display grid in the web-
based TUNA elicitation experiment and the intrinsic human
evalution experiment were slightly distorted. This may have
affected timings in those (very rare) cases where a description
explicitly referenced the column a target referent was located
in, as in the chair in column 1.

This year we tried out a version of the experi-
ment where subjects listened to descriptions read
out by a synthetic voice11 over headphones while
looking at the pictures displayed on the screen.
Stimulus presentation was carried out using
DMDX, a Win-32 software package for psycholin-
guistic experiments involving time measurements
(Forster and Forster, 2003). Participants initiated
each trial, which consisted of an initial warning
bell and a fixation point flashed on the screen for
1000ms. Following this, the visual domain was
displayed, and the voice reading the description
was initiated after a delay of 500ms. We recorded
time in milliseconds from the start of display to the
mouse-click whereby a participant identified the
target referent. This is hereafter referred to as the
identification speed. The analysis reported below
also uses identification accuracy, the percentage
of correctly identified target referents, as an addi-
tional dependent variable. Trials timed out after
15, 000ms.
Participants: The experiment was carried out
by 16 participants recruited from among the fac-
ulty and administrative staff of the University of
Brighton. All participants carried out the experi-
ment under supervision in the same quiet room on
the same laptop, in the same ambient conditions,
with no interruptions. All participants were native
speakers, and we recorded type of post, whether
they had normal colour vision and hearing, and
whether they were left or right-handed.
Timeouts and outliers: None of the trials
reached time-out stage during the experiment.
Outliers were defined as those identification times
which fell outside the mean ±2SD (standard de-
viation) range. 44 data points (4.9%) out of a to-
tal of 896 were identified as outliers by this defi-
nition; these were replaced with the series mean
(Ratliff, 1993). The results reported for identi-
fication speed below are based on these adjusted
times.
Results: Table 8 displays mean identification
speed and identification accuracy per system. A

5.4 Correlations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974655172414">
Table 10 displays the correlations between the
eight evaluation measures we used. The num-
bers are Pearson product-moment correlation co-
efficients, calculated on the means (1 mean per
system on each measure).
As regards the human-assessed intrinsic scores,
there is no significant correlation between Ad-
equacy and Fluency. Among the automatically
computed intrinsic measures, the only significant
correlation is between Accuracy and BLEU. For
the extrinsic identification performance measures,
there is no significant correlation between Identi-
fication Accuracy and Identification Speed.
As for correlations across the two types
(human-assessed and automatically computed) of
intrinsic measures, the only significant correla-
tions are between Fluency and Accuracy, and be-
tween Adequacy and Accuracy. So, a system
with a higher percentage of human-like outputs
(as measured by Accurach) also tends to be scored
more highly in terms of Fluency and Adequacy by
humans.
We also found significant correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic measures: there was a
strong and significant correlation between Iden-
tification Accuracy and Adequacy, implying that
more adequate system outputs allowed people to
identify target referents more correctly; there was
also a significant (negative) correlation between

6 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998865625">
The three editions of the TUNA STEC have at-
tracted a substantial amount of interest. In addi-
tion to a sizeable body of new work on referring
expression generation, as another tangible out-
come of these STECs we now have a wide range
of different sets of system outputs for the same set
of inputs. A particularly valuable resource is the
pairing of these outputs from the submitted sys-
tems in each edition with evaluation data.
As this was the last time we are running a STEC
with the TUNA data, we will now make all data
sets, documentation and evaluation software from
all TUNA STECs available to researchers. We are
planning to add to these as many system outputs
as we can, so that other researchers can perform
evaluations involving these.
We are also planning to complete our evalua-
tions of the evaluation methods we have devel-
oped. Among such experiments will be direct
comparisons between the results of the three vari-
ants of the identification experiment we have tried
out, and a direct comparison between different
designs for human-assessed intrinsic evaluations
(e.g. comparing the slider design reported here to
preference judgments and rating scales).
Apart from the technological progress in REG
which we hope the TUNA STECs have helped
achieve, perhaps the single most important scien-
tific result is strong evidence for the importance
of extrinsic evaluations, as these do not necessar-
ily agree with the results of much more commonly
used intrinsic types of evaluations.

This report describes the TUNAREG task and the evaluation methods used, and presents the evaluation results. 1 Introduction This year’s run of the TUNA-REG Shared-Task Evaluation Competition (STEC) is the third, and final, competition to involve the TUNA Corpus of referring expressions. The TUNA Corpus was first used in the Pilot Attribute Selection for Generating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge (Belz and Gatt, 2007) which took place between May and September 2007; and again for three of the shared tasks in Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenges 2008, which ran between September 2007 and May 2008 (Gatt et al., 2008). This year’s TUNA Task replicates one of the three tasks from REG’08, the TUNA-REG Task. It uses the same test data, to enable direct comparison against the 2008 results.

Participants initiated each trial, which consisted of an initial warning bell and a fixation point flashed on the screen for 1000ms. Following this, the visual domain was displayed, and the voice reading the description was initiated after a delay of 500ms. We recorded time in milliseconds from the start of display to the mouse-click whereby a participant identified the target referent. This is hereafter referred to as the identification speed. The analysis reported below also uses identification accuracy, the percentage of correctly identified target referents, as an additional dependent va</context>

The TUNA Corpus was first used in the Pilot Attribute Selection for Generating Referring Expressions (ASGRE) Challenge (Belz and Gatt, 2007) which took place between May and September 2007; and again for three of the shared tasks in Referring Expression Generation (REG) Challenges 2008, which ran between September 2007 and May 2008 (Gatt et al., 2008). This year’s TUNA Task replicates one of the three tasks from REG’08, the TUNA-REG Task. It uses the same test data, to enable direct comparison against the 2008 results. Four participating teams submitted 6 different systems this year; teams and their affiliations are shown in Table 1.

Procedure: In each of their 5 practice trials and 56 real trials, participants were shown a system output (i.e. a WORD-STRING), together with its corresponding domain, displayed as the set of corresponding images on the screen. In this experiment the intended referent was not highlighted in the onscreen display, and the participants’ task was to identify the intended referent among the pictures by mouse-clicking on it.10 In previous TUNA identification experiments (Belz and Gatt, 2007; Gatt et al., 2008), subjects had to read the description before identifying the intended referent. In ASGRE’07 both description and pictures were displayed at the same time, yielding a single time measure that combined reading and identification times. In REG’08, subjects first read the description and then called up the pictures on the screen when they had finished reading the description, which yielded separate reading and identification times. 10Due to limitations related to the stimulus presentation software, the images in this experiment were displayed in strict rows and columns, whereas the display grid i</context>

(2001" startWordPosition="2326" endWordPosition="2329">tringedit distance (SE) is the classic Levenshtein distance measure and computes the minimal number of insertions, deletions and substitutions required to transform one string into another. We set the cost for insertions and deletions to 1, and that for substitutions to 2. If two strings are identical, then this metric returns 0 (perfect match). Otherwise the value depends on the length of the two strings (the maximum value is the sum of the lengths). As an aggregate measure, we compute the mean of pairwise SE scores. BLEU-x is an n-gram based string comparison measure, originally proposed by Papineni et al. (2001; 2002) for evaluation of Machine Translation systems. It computes the proportion of word n-grams of length x and less that a system output shares with several reference outputs. Setting x = 4 (i.e. considering all n-grams of length ≤ 4) is standard, but because many of the TUNA descriptions are shorter than 4 tokens, we compute BLEU-3 instead. BLEU ranges from 0 to 1. NIST is a version of BLEU, but where BLEU gives equal weight to all n-grams, NIST gives more importance to less frequent n-grams, which are taken to be more informative. The maximum NIST score depends on the size of the test set</context>

All participants were native speakers, and we recorded type of post, whether they had normal colour vision and hearing, and whether they were left or right-handed. Timeouts and outliers: None of the trials reached time-out stage during the experiment. Outliers were defined as those identification times which fell outside the mean ±2SD (standard deviation) range. 44 data points (4.9%) out of a total of 896 were identified as outliers by this definition; these were replaced with the series mean (Ratliff, 1993). The results reported for identification speed below are based on these adjusted times. Results: Table 8 displays mean identification speed and identification accuracy per system. A univariate ANOVA on identification speed revealed significant main effects of SYSTEM (F(7,880) = 4.04,p &lt; .001) and DOMAIN (F(1,880) = 11We used the University of Edinburgh’s Festival speech generation system (Black et al., 1999) in combination with the nitech us slt arctic hts voice, a high-quality female American voice.
