This book develops a comprehensive
proto-property theory of argument encod-
ing based on the work of David Dowty
(1989, 1991): such a theory is intended
to cover much of the empirical ground of
mapping/linking theories in identifying
the principles of correspondence between
the lexical semantics of predicators and
the relational and case encodings of their
arguments.

John Etchemendy
</author>
<bodyText confidence="0.941836583333333">
The intuitive concept of consequence, the
notion that one sentence follows logically
from another, has driven the study of
logic for more than two thousand years.
But logic has moved forward dramatically
in the past century—largely as a result
of bringing mathematics to bear on the
field. The aim of this book is to correct a
common misunderstanding of one of the
most widely used techniques of mathe-
matical logic.

Focus
Linguistic, Cognitive, and
Computational Perspectives
P. Bosch and
R. van der Sandt, Editors
This book presents a collection of papers
on the issue of focus in its broadest sense.
While commonly considered as being
related to phenomena such as presupposi-
tion and anaphora, focusing is much more
widely spread, and it is this pervasiveness
that the current collection addresses. The
work loosely originates from a conference
held in 1994 in Schloss Wolfsbrunnen in
Germany, although only a small subpart
of the proceedings papers presented are
included here.

Coverbs and Complex
Predicates in Wagiman
Stephen Wilson
Wagiman is an Australian Aboriginal
language spoken by about ten people in
the Top End of the Northern Territory.
It possesses an unusual open class of
words which Wilson calls &amp;quot;coverbs.&amp;quot;
Coverbs are responsible for conveying
a wide range of mostly verbal and
adjectival meanings.

Explanation
Gert Webelhuth,

Covering a wide array of linguistic topics

document the singular ability of lexicalist
theories of grammar to provide analyses
that combine the advantages of explana-
toriness, analytic precision, and thorough
empirical data coverage.

Lexical Relations
Jean-Pierre Koenig
The thrust of this book is to provide a
model of lexical relations that reconciles
the lexicon&apos;s idiosyncratic and productive
aspects. Its basic thesis is that all lexical
relations reduce to categorization
(the membership of the two related
lexemes in a common category) and
that category intersection is the only
mechanism needed to model lexical
processes, provided lexical items can
be stored partially underspecified as
to their category membership.

Guidelines for Submissions
</table>
<note confidence="0.7044198">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</note>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.871513">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955500611111111">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
&apos;forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electroni-
cally; consult http://www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the LATEX
style files. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies
the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to
another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-
refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by .the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluafe the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should
in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (LATEX source, postscript or plain

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing,
and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.
