A notorious problem with computational lin-
guistics is that there is no path into it. The
usual CL course presumes a strong back-
ground in both linguistics and computer
programming—an unlikely combination, es-
pecially for students who came to linguistics
from the study of languages and literature.
This textbook presupposes no background
in either subject. It can be used to give
a taste of Prolog programming and natu-
ral language parsing to students with no
computer experience. Prolog is introduced
through simple logic puzzles, and then ap-
plied to bibliographic databases, morpholog-
ical paradigms, and simple parsers. The au-
thor takes care to warn students about typ-
ing errors, endless loops, and other computer
pitfalls that they might not be primed to rec-
ognize. An accompanying diskette includes a
freeware Prolog interpreter for the IBM PC,
together with program source code usable in
any Prolog implementation.
The disadvantage of this slow, gentle ap-
proach is that even by the end of the book,
neither Prolog nor parsing has been covered
in depth. Despite the book&apos;s title, only a few
grammar rules are presented. Basic parsing
techniques such as DCGs and difference lists
are not introduced; instead, a typical gram-
mar rule is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.733689">
vp(X) append(A,B,X), v(A), np(B).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992964411764706">
Feature structures or their equivalent are not
used, nor is any mechanism for semantic in-
terpretation indicated. Nor is it clear how
the Syntactic Structures–style phrase-structure
rules relate to the ultramodern Chomskyan
minimalism that the author expounds.
Thus, the student who completes this book
will still need a Prolog course as well as a
linguistics course before doing serious NLP.
Nonetheless, Dougherty has performed a
useful service by making CL accessible to
even the most technophobic of undergrad-
uates. He is using the book himself at New
York University, and it evidently works well
there. It could even be used with talented
high school students.—Michael A. Covington,

This work addresses the repre-
sentation problem ... how best
to represent the meanings of lin-
guistic expressions... One might
call this the &apos;semantic form&apos; of
expressions (p. xi, italics in the
original).
The book begins with &amp;quot;three chapters in
which I survey the contributions made by
linguistics, logic and computer science respec-
tively to the representation of meaning&amp;quot;
(p. xii). These three chapters are not easy
to understand, principally because of Potts&apos;s
obtuse style, an example of which is that in-
stead of saying &amp;quot;&apos;either P or Q&apos; is false if
&apos;P&apos; and &apos;Q&apos; are both false; otherwise, it is
true,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;we lay down that a proposi-
tion having the structure represented by &apos;ei-
ther P or Q&apos; is to be accounted false if a
false proposition is substituted for &apos;P&apos; and
a false proposition for &apos;Q&apos;, but is otherwise
to be accounted true&amp;quot; (p. 53). These chap-
ters are also outdated. In particular, the chap-
ter on computer science, discussing the work
of researchers whose goals are the closest to
Potts&apos;s own stated goals, is mainly a review
of work as of the seventies. There are ci-
tations to several of the papers in Findler
(1979), but only three to more recent research
publications: Hayes (1980), Sowa (1984), and
Hobbs and Shieber (1987). Perhaps the most
valuable aspect of these three chapters is
Potts&apos;s criticisms of some of the work he sur-
veys. Of course, some of the problems noted
have been corrected in literature that Potts
hasn&apos;t yet got around to reading.
By the end of the three survey chapters,
Potts has introduced two techniques that he

then develops into his own representation—
categorial grammars and graphs as represen-
tation formalisms. He takes the categorial
analysis to be the prior of the two, with his
graphs, which he calls categorial graphs, being
the clearer representation of sentence mean-
ing. Unfortunately, &amp;quot;formalism&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;clearer&amp;quot;
must be taken with a grain of salt. Potts never
formally defines his categorial graphs, let
alone gives a formal semantics for them. Al-
though I have had extensive experience read-
ing, interpreting, and devising graphical rep-
resentations of meaning, I could not under-
stand the details of Potts&apos;s graphs. But then,
neither, apparently, can he: &amp;quot;The relationship
between semantic and syntactic structures
has not been spelled out, so that it is not fully
determinate what our semantic representa-
tions represent at the syntactic level&amp;quot; (p. 168).
The four substantive chapters are useful
for the linguistic issues that they address,
even if they are not useful for the representa-
tion scheme that they develop. These issues,
which must eventually be faced by all knowl-
edge representation formalisms that aspire to
complete coverage of natural language in-
clude: quantifier scope; pronouns; relative
clauses; count nouns, substance nouns, and
proper names; generic propositions; deictic
terms; plurals; identity; and adverbs.
Appropriately, the book does not end on
a note of claimed accomplishment, but on a
note of work yet to do: &amp;quot;The purpose of a
philosophical book is to stimulate thought,
not to put it to rest with solutions to every
problem ... It is still premature to formulate
a graph grammar for semantic representation
of everyday language... The representation
problem is commonly not accorded the re-
spect which it deserves&amp;quot; (p. 288). Many peo-
ple agree, and have, accordingly, produced
a vast literature that Potts is apparently not
familiar with. (Some relevant collections are
Cercone and McCalla 1987, Sowa 1991, and
Lehmann 1992.) Nevertheless, Potts is still
correct when he suggests that there is much
work left to do.—Stuart C. Shapiro, State Uni-
versity of New York at Buffalo

In 1972, Ducrot and Todorov produced the
Diction naire encyclopedique des sciences du Ian-
gage with the same publisher, but the present
work on pragmatics is thicker and discusses
its topics at greater length, as in a course
book. It is organized thematically, with a good
index and a glossary of some 80 items. There
are many discussions of domain definition;
in particular, it is steadfastly argued that prag-
matics and linguistics do not overlap (de-
spite a nice slip in presupposition in a head-
ing on page 500 referring to &amp;quot;Pragmatics and
the rest of linguistics&amp;quot; [&amp;quot;La pragmatique et

almost complete absence of references or dis-
cussion on semantics (except for Fauconnier),
semiotics, social psychology and cognitive
psychology (except for the classical ground-
ing in sociolinguistics), literary studies, and
recent cultural critical theories. Likewise,

(Wierzbicka 1991) are not mentioned. If the
view of pragmatics is to exclude the study
of language-in-use from the reach of linguis-
tics, then these companion areas should be at
least considered in a book of this sort.
The eighteen chapters cover a variety of
topics: truth-conditionality, context and ref-
erence, mental spaces, logical and nonlogi-
cal connectors, discourse laws and conver-
sational postulates, presupposition, implica-
ture, argumentation, Ducrot&apos;s theory of enun-
ciation, deixis, vague concepts, metaphor, nar-
ration, coherence, and discourse analysis and
conversation analysis (Moeschler&apos;s favorite
topic: 1985, 1989). The work mentions many
European authors, while strangely apologiz-
ing for mentioning many Americans. Some
references to the latter deserve updating (e.g.,
Putnam has changed, and Fodor has explored
new directions). Moeschler and Reboul are
close to Ducrot on enunciation, and espe-
cially to Sperber and Wilson for their theory
of relevance (1986), an approach on which
they have just published a book (Moeschler,
Reboul, Luscher, and Jayez 1994). Grice,
Fodor, and Searle are extensively discussed.
I resented the absence of &apos;computational
pragmatics&apos;—if it can be called that—as in
human–machine communication. One would
have expected a discussion of the contribu-
tions of, say, Bunt (e.g., 1994), Cohen (e.g.,
Cohen, Morgan, and Pollack 1990), Hovy (e.g.,
1993), McKeown (e.g., 1985), Wilks and Bal-
lim (1991), and many others. Instead the book
argues that &amp;quot;technicians of informatics have
been designing their own linguistics, which
amounts to a technique applied to language
rather than a science of language&amp;quot; [&amp;quot;les tech-
niciens de l&apos;informatique Font elabore1 leur
propre linguistique, qui se resume a une tech-
nique appliquee au langage plus qu&apos;a une
science du langage&amp;quot; (p. 497)1. The fact that
models, when original, are implemented, cer-
tainly does not detract from their quality;
quite the contrary.
In sum, the book has to be acknowledged
as a comprehensive one on &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; pragmat-
ics, and a well-written and well-argued ini-
tiator, navigator, and reference work. It com-
pares favorably with Levinson&apos;s (1983)

coherence, or &amp;quot;contextual unity,&amp;quot; in a text,
and how cohesive (textual) devices help put
it there in the first place. She considers not
only the coherence of the wordstream of a
text but also the effects that layout and doc-
ument design have on the perception of tex-
tual coherence. Her basic point is that sensing
textual coherence is a matter of gestalt per-
ception, much the same as our perception of
unity and structure in visual and auditory
stimuli. For example, the perception of rel-
evance, with bridging inferences where nec-
essary, is like gestalt vision, where we fill in
the missing pieces. In the case of coherence,
the knowledge that is used includes linguis-
tic, pragmatic, social, and idiosyncratic world
knowledge.
According to Campbell, the cohesive ele-
ments by which the producer of a text es-
tablishes coherence and continuity in a text
are governed by two main principles: simi-
larity of structure and elements, and proxim-
ity. Campbell shows how these relate to the
gestalt perception of structure, through meta-
principles of reinforcement and conflict. For
example, similarity can create a background
against which dissimilar things can be fore-
grounded. Thus, discontinuity is a crucial
factor in indicating structure by creating a
transition.
Campbell addresses her book to techni-
cal writers and communication theorists, not
computational linguists. But as research in
natural language generation becomes more
interested in the automatic production of
whole documents, not just sentences or short
paragraphs, NLG systems are starting to be-
come technical writers, and their builders
must therefore become communication the-
orists. In such systems, the problem of main-
taining cohesion and coherence in the text
produced becomes much larger than merely
ensuring that coreference links are felicitous.
Campbell&apos;s book is valuable for its provi-
sion of a clear way of looking at the prob-
lem, a vocabulary for discussing it, and in-
triguing hints as to how the research should

Nevertheless, Potts is still correct when he suggests that there is much left to State University of New York at Buffalo</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.987312704225352">Diction naire encyclopedique des sciences du Ianthe same publisher, but the present work on pragmatics is thicker and discusses its topics at greater length, as in a course book. It is organized thematically, with a good index and a glossary of some 80 items. There are many discussions of domain definition; in particular, it is steadfastly argued that pragmatics and linguistics do not overlap (despite a nice slip in presupposition in a heading on page 500 referring to &amp;quot;Pragmatics and the rest of linguistics&amp;quot; [&amp;quot;La pragmatique et le reste de la linguistiquel). I regretted the almost complete absence of references or discussion on semantics (except for Fauconnier), semiotics, social psychology and cognitive psychology (except for the classical grounding in sociolinguistics), literary studies, and recent cultural critical theories. Likewise, power, gender, and cross-cultural differences 428 Briefly Noted (Wierzbicka 1991) are not mentioned. If the view of pragmatics is to exclude the study of language-in-use from the reach of linguistics, then these companion areas should be at least considered in a book of this sort. The eighteen chapters cover a variety of truth-conditionality, context and reference, mental spaces, logical and nonlogical connectors, discourse laws and conversational postulates, presupposition, implicature, argumentation, Ducrot&apos;s theory of enundeixis, vague concepts, metaphor, narration, coherence, and discourse analysis and conversation analysis (Moeschler&apos;s favorite topic: 1985, 1989). The work mentions many European authors, while strangely apologizing for mentioning many Americans. Some references to the latter deserve updating (e.g., Putnam has changed, and Fodor has explored new directions). Moeschler and Reboul are to Ducrot on enunciation, and especially to Sperber and Wilson for their theory of relevance (1986), an approach on which they have just published a book (Moeschler, Reboul, Luscher, and Jayez 1994). Grice, Fodor, and Searle are extensively discussed. I resented the absence of &apos;computational pragmatics&apos;—if it can be called that—as in human–machine communication. One would have expected a discussion of the contributions of, say, Bunt (e.g., 1994), Cohen (e.g., Cohen, Morgan, and Pollack 1990), Hovy (e.g., 1993), McKeown (e.g., 1985), Wilks and Ballim (1991), and many others. Instead the book argues that &amp;quot;technicians of informatics have been designing their own linguistics, which amounts to a technique applied to language than a science of language&amp;quot; [&amp;quot;les techniciens de l&apos;informatique Font elabore1 leur linguistique, qui se resume a une technique appliquee au langage plus qu&apos;a une science du langage&amp;quot; (p. 497)1. The fact that models, when original, are implemented, certainly does not detract from their quality; quite the contrary. In sum, the book has to be acknowledged a comprehensive one on &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; pragmatics, and a well-written and well-argued initiator, navigator, and reference work. It com-</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.997461659574468">coherence, or &amp;quot;contextual unity,&amp;quot; in a text, and how cohesive (textual) devices help put it there in the first place. She considers not only the coherence of the wordstream of a text but also the effects that layout and document design have on the perception of textual coherence. Her basic point is that sensing textual coherence is a matter of gestalt perception, much the same as our perception of unity and structure in visual and auditory stimuli. For example, the perception of relevance, with bridging inferences where necessary, is like gestalt vision, where we fill in the missing pieces. In the case of coherence, the knowledge that is used includes linguistic, pragmatic, social, and idiosyncratic world knowledge. According to Campbell, the cohesive elements by which the producer of a text establishes coherence and continuity in a text governed by two main principles: simistructure and elements, and proximshows how these relate to the gestalt perception of structure, through metaof example, similarity can create a background against which dissimilar things can be foregrounded. Thus, discontinuity is a crucial factor in indicating structure by creating a transition. Campbell addresses her book to technical writers and communication theorists, not computational linguists. But as research in natural language generation becomes more interested in the automatic production of whole documents, not just sentences or short paragraphs, NLG systems are starting to become technical writers, and their builders must therefore become communication theorists. In such systems, the problem of maintaining cohesion and coherence in the text produced becomes much larger than merely ensuring that coreference links are felicitous. Campbell&apos;s book is valuable for its provision of a clear way of looking at the problem, a vocabulary for discussing it, and intriguing hints as to how the research should</abstract>
