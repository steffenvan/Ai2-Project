PREFACE
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.992865870967742">
This volume represents the fourth proceedings of an &amp;quot;ACL Applied&amp;quot; conference. The contents of
these pages illustrate some of the changes that have influenced us since the first such conference
in 1983: a heightened emphasis on applications and commercial enterprise, integration of natural
language processing with other technologies, and the emergence of innovative new applications and
methods. The pace of change in the field has become so rapid that the community felt a need to
have an applied conference on a regular basis; hence, this conference follows the third by only two
years.
Never has the interplay between computational linguistics and applications been so active and
harmonious. Emerging applications and even emerging commercial successes have driven research,
for example, in multimedia systems, information retrieval, lexical representation, multi-lingual
tools, and document processing. New methods in turn have led to improved applicability and
commercial viability. The work reported here falls on both sides of an important boundary: the
&amp;quot;technology push&amp;quot; that helps to create applications and markets, and the &amp;quot;market pull&amp;quot; that guides
research and development, creates funding, and heightens the excitement in the field.
The process by which this proceedings has been created reflects some of the same changes that
have driven the research. Much of the preparation, review, revision, and final transmission of the
papers was done electronically, leading to the rapid, easy, and accurate exchange and reproduction
of materials between points as distant as North America and Asia, as well as Eastern and Southern
Europe. The same worldwide connectivity that makes this possible is also responsible for some of
the advances in the field as well as for some emerging applications.
A number of people deserve special recognition for their contribution to this effort. Trisha Yannuzzi
of the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science and Craig Reynolds of the GRASP Laboratory
at the University of Pennsylvania helped to coordinate the program committee activities as well as
the preparation of the proceedings, with help from Jodi Kerper and others at IRCS. Uwe Reyle,
along with Christian Rohrer and others in Stuttgart, made the conference arrangements and did
publicity as well as the cover layout. Fernando Pereira, Karen Sparck Jones, and others in the ACL
provided logistical as well as moral support. These individuals contributed to a global, integrated
project representative of the current state of the art.
