Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.927309310344828">
We propose a treatment of coordination
based on the concepts of functor, argument
and sub categorization. Its formalization
comprises two parts which are conceptually
independent. On one hand, we have ex-
tended the feature structure unification to
disjunctive and set values in order to check
the compatibility and the satisfiability of
sub categorization requirements by struc-
tured complements. On the other hand, we
have considered the conjunction et (and)
as the head of the coordinate structure,
so that coordinate structures stem simply
from the subcategorization specifications of
et and the general schemata of a head sat-
uration. Both parts have been encoded
within HPSG using the same resource that
is the subcategorization and its principle
which we have just extended.

We claim here that the &amp;quot;local combinatory poten-

tion feature, explains the previous linguistic facts:
conjuncts may be of different categories as well as of
more than one constituent, they just have to satisfy
the sub categorization constraints.

Coordination has always been a centre of academic
interest, be it in linguistic theory or in computa-
tional linguistics. The problem is that the assump-
tion according to only the constituents of the same
category (1) may be conjoined is false; indeed, coor-
dinations of different categories (2)-(3) and of more
than one constituent (4)-(5) should not be dismissed
though being marginal in written texts and must be
accounted for&apos;.

We focus here on the coordination of syntagmatic
categories (as opposite of lexical categories). More
precisely, we account for cases of non constituent
coordination (4), of Right Node Raising (5) but not
for cases of Gapping.
Our approach which is independent of any frame-
work, is easily and precisely encoded in the for-
malism of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar
(HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994), which is based on
the notion of head and makes available the feature
sharing mechanism we need. The paper is organized
as follows. Section 2 gives a brief description of ba-
sic data and discusses some constraints and avail-
able structures. Section 3 summarizes previous ap-
proaches and section 4 is devoted to our approach.
The french coordination with et serves throughout
the paper as an example.

2 A brief description of Basic Data
and Constraints
The classical typology of coordination, i.e. coordi-
nation of constituents (1) and of non-constituents,
hides some regularity of the phenomenon as it fo-
cuses on concepts of constituent and syntactic cate-
gory.
A coordination of constituents is interpreted as
one phrase without any gap. The constituents may
be of the same category (1) as well as of different
categories (2)-(3). However, this last case is con-
strained as examplified hereafter2.

In these examples, the coordinate structure acts as
the argument of the verb. This verb must subcate-
gorize for each constituent of the coordination and
this is not the case in example (2c)-(2e). Note that
modelizing coordination of different categories as the
unification (i.e. underspecification) of the different
categories would lead to accept the six examples
or wrongly reject (2d) according to the descriptions
used3.
Coordination of more than one constituent are of-
ten classified as Conjunction Reduction (4), Gap-
ping (1a-lb) and Right Node Raising (5) (Hudson,
1976).

In the case of Gapping structures, the subject (la)
and/or an extracted element (lb) is present in the
two sides. The only allowed coordinated structure
is [Jean danse la valse] et [Pierre le tango] for (la)
and [Hier, Jean a danse la valse] et [aujourd&apos;hui, le
tango] for (lb) as wh-sentences on other parts ([1a

Two structures are available in case of Conjunc-
tion Reductions. One structure corresponds to a co-
ordination of sentences with a gap of the verb after
et, the other one consists in taking the coordinate
parallel sequence of constituents as only one struc-
ture. The previous facts argue for the second pos-
sibility (see also section 3 for criticism of deletion
approach).
Last, note that gapping the verb is less compati-
ble with head-driven mechanisms (and the comma in
(4f) could be such a head mark, see (BEF, 1996) for
an analysis of Gapping coordinations). It seems then
that the structure needed for Conjunction Reduc-
tion is some generalization of the standard structure
used for coordination of constituents. Our proposal
is then focused on this extension. We do not care of
Gapping cases as their linguistic properties seem to
be different.
It remains to integrate Right-Node Raising and to
extend these cases to more complicated ones. Sec-
tion 4 includes examples of such cases and shows
that our proposal can manage them adequately.

3 Previous Approaches
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958125">
There exists a classical way to eschew the question
&amp;quot;what can be coordinated ?&amp;quot; if one assumes a dele-
tion analysis. Indeed, according to this approach
(Chomsky, 1957; Banfield, 1981), only coordination
of sentences are basic and other syntagmatic coordi-
nations should be considered as coordinations of re-
duced sentences, the reduction being performed by
deleting repeated elements. This approach comes up
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992995">

<bodyText confidence="0.999563416666667">
against insurmountable obstacles, chiefly with the
problem of applying transformation in reverse, in
the analysis process (Schachter, 1973).
A direct approach has been proposed at once by
Sag &amp; al. (Sag et al., 1985) within the framework
of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG),
by (Pollard and Sag, 1994) within HPSG, and
(Bresnan, 1986) within Lexical Functional Grammar
(LFG). These approaches have tried to account for
coordination of different categories in reducing the
constraint from requiring the same category for con-
juncts to a weaker constraint of category compat-
ibility. Whatever the nature of subcategorization
information may be, syntactical in GPSG, hybrid in
HPSG, functional in LFG, two categories are com-
patible if they subsume a &amp;quot;common denominator&amp;quot;,
in this case a common partial structure.
Technically, the compatibility is checked by com-
puting a &amp;quot;generalization&amp;quot; of categories and imposing
the generalization comprises all features expected in
the given context. For example, the context in (6),
that is, the verb etre (to be), expects a predicative
argument and both categories NP and AP are just
predicative categories.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998185">
However, this solution cannot be applied gener-
ally because all coordinations have not such &amp;quot;natu-
ral&amp;quot; intersection (see (2)). So we claim that we have
nothing else to do but explicitly enumerate, within
the head subcategorization feature, all the structures
allowed as complement.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.984239" genericHeader="method">
4 Our Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999678">
Our proposition involves three stages. We begin
by formulating constraints on coordinate structures,
then we define how to build the coordinate struc-
tures and we end by specifying how the previous
constraints filter through such coordinate structures.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999709">
4.1 Constraints on coordinate structures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941345454546">
In order to precisely formulate the constraints on co-
ordinate structures, we distinguish the role of func-
tor and that of argument, where functor categories
are those that bear unsatisfied subcategorization re-
quirements, as it is the case in Categorial Grammars
(Dowty, 1988). Lexical heads (1) are functors in re-
lation to the arguments they select and, by compo-
sition, any expression that contains an unsaturated
functor is a functor (5)-(7).
head4. An argument may often be realized by differ-
ent categories. For example, the argument required
by savoir (to know) may be a NP or a Comple-
tive: we say that the requirement is disjunctive and
we represent the different alternatives within sub-
categorization feature disjunctive values. An argu-
ment specification is then a disjunction of categories.
When the lexical head requires several complements
(to ask somebody something), the requirement is said
multiple or n-requirement. To the extent that dis-
junction only appears in argument specifications, a
n-requirement is a multi-set of simple requirements.
The choice of set (or more precisely multiset) rather
than list value for the feature SUBCAT allows us to
account for Je demande a Pierre son velo as well as
Je demande son velo a Pierre. Gunji (Gunji, 1987)
makes the same choice. However our criterion can
be formalized in a theory whose order of arguments
obeys to an obliqueness hierarchy.
Requirement inheritance. A functor may com-
pose with another functor or with arguments. In
functor-arguments composition, the resulting ex-
pression inherits the unsatisfied requirement from
the functor when it is not empty. For example, in
(5), both conjuncts inherit the unsatisfied require-
ment from their heads. Likewise the functor com-
position inherits a requirement from the unsatisfied
functor5. In (7), pretend detester inherits the unsat-
isfied requirement of detester, i.e. the requirement
of an object.
Adjuncts. To account for the continuum which
exists from strictly subcategorized complements to
adjuncts, we adopt the hypothesis suggested by
(Miller, 1991) according to which adjuncts could
be accorded the same status as arguments by inte-
grating them into the subcategorization requirement
through an optional lexical rule. That would enable
us to account for coordination of adjuncts of differ-
ent categories (3) as well as coordination of more
than one constituent with adjuncts (10)-(11) below.
Note that we may still have a special feature AD-
JUNCT in order to distinguish adjuncts from other
complements if necessary. Note also that these lexi-
cal rules can be interpreted statically as well as dy-
namically. In the first case, the extended lexicon is
pre-computed and requires no runtime application.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.6812046">
&apos;In this paper, we restrict arguments to complements.
In our HPSG encoding, they are treated in the SUBCAT
feature. In a Borsley-like manner, we suppose a special
feature for the subject. However, our approach can be
generalized to subjects.
5In functor composition, functors cannot be both un-
saturated: * 11 promet de manger a sa mere des ba-
nanes.(* he promises to eat his mother bananas.), cf.
the Incomplete Constituent Constraint (Pollard and Sag,

Satisfiability conditions of requirements.
We observe here that a coordination of different cat-
egories may appear as head complement when the
head requirement is disjunctive and a coordination
of more than one constituent appears when such a
requirement is multiple. Last, functors may conjoin
when their sub categorization requirements are com-
patible. These observations are synthesized in one
coordination criterion.
The first observation is summarized in (Cl) and
illustrated in (2&apos;).
(Cl) A subcategorization 1-requirement is satis-
fied either by one of the disjuncts or by a coordi-
nation of disjuncts.
(2&apos;) Je sais son age /qu&apos;elle est venue ici / son age
et qu&apos;elle est venue ici.
(I know her age /that she came here / her age and
that she came here.)
The second one is illustrated below, where subcat-
egorization n-requirements are satisfied either by:

All these situations are summarized in (C2):
(C2) A subcategorization n-requirement is satis-
fied by m arguments,0 &lt; m &lt; n, either by a se-
quence of m arguments such that each argument
satisfies one and only one element of the require-
ment or by a coordination of such sequences. The
result has a n — m requirement.
Note that (Cl) and (C2) should be computed si-
multaneously in order to account for structures as
(9). The notion of partial saturation in (C2) allows
us to account for coordination of sub-series of argu-
ments as in (10).
Functors coordination and compatibility of
requirements. Functors may be simple (1), com-
posed (7), of different structures (12) or partially
saturated (13)-(5).

(I expect to receive from John and offer to Peter

In all cases, when they are conjoined, they share
their arguments: there must therefore exist at least
one possibility of satisfying them simultaneously. In
this case, the unification of their subcategorization
requirements succeeds and they are said to be com-
patible and the two functors may be conjoined. This
unification has to account for disjunctive values.
Coordination criterion: satisfying and im-
posing requirements. As an entity can be both
functor and argument (12)-(13) our coordination cri-
terion (necessary condition) is the following one: the
conjuncts must satisfy the same simple or multiple
sub categorization requirement and impose compati-
ble sub categorization requirements.

4.3 How coordinate structures are built
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974969951219512">
Until now we have just defined constraints on the
coordinate structures but we did not mention how
these structures are built. We want that a coordi-
nate structure inherits features from its conjuncts
without necessarily failing in case of conflicting val-
ues. The generalization method (Sag et al., 1985)
has this objective but overgenerates because the con-
flicting values are ignored. In contrast, the use of
composite categories (Cooper, 1991) keeps conflict-
ing values within the connective &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;. Intuitively,
if son age (her age) is a NP and qu&apos;elle est venue
ici (that she came here) is a Completive, son age
qu&apos;elle est venue ici (her age and that she came here)
is a conjunctive composite category NPACompl.
The structuring of categories : composite
and tuple of categories. We propose to extend
the operation A to complex categories and to use
a new connective &lt; &gt; in order to define tuple
of categories. With these two connectives, a total
structuring of categories is possible and all the coor-
dinate structures may have a status. For example,
the underlined expression in (14) will be represented
by the structured category: (PP, [SitiZg°7411).
(14) Je recommande h Pierre la lecture et
qu&apos;il s&apos;inspire de la Bible.
(I recommend to Peter the lecture and that he
inspires himself of the Bible.)
The extension to complex categories is not uni-
form. Coordinate structure features are not neces-
sarily composites or tuples of corresponding features
from each conjunct. In fact, features which are al-
lowed to have conflicting values will be compounded,
whereas other features as SUBCAT must unify. This
structuring is encoded later within the definition of
the lexical entry of et.
Lexicalization of the coordination rule. We
consider, as in (Paritong, 1992), the conjunction
et as the head of the coordinate structure. Con-
sequently, coordinate structures no longer have to
be postulated in the grammar by a special rule of
coordination: they stem simply from the general

6This condition will forbid the conjunction of e.g.
verbs with S1JBCAT lists of different lengths, but which
would have a unification under the alternative interpre-
tation, thus avoiding sentences like *John bought and
gave the book to Mary, (Miller, 1991).

<bodyText confidence="0.98980872972973">
schemata of the head saturation and the subcatego-
rization specifications of the conjunction. For sake of
simplicity, only binary coordination is treated here.
(Paritong, 1992) accounts for multiple coordination
as a binary structure where the comma has a simi-
lar function as a lexical conjunction. With that one
restriction, the HPSG-like lexical entry of et can be:
The following LP-constraint on the lexical entry
of et ensures the correct order of conjunction and
conjuncts:
[i] &lt; con j &lt; [e], where i E [1, Mb i&apos; E [1&apos;, MTh
This LP-constraint is the minimum required to
distinguish the two parts of the coordinate struc-
ture. However, the functor this coordinate struc-
ture (partially-)saturates may impose its own LP-
constraint (e.g. an obliqueness hierarchy). In such
a case, this LP-constraint has to be satisfied si-
multaneously by the two sets f[1], ... , [M]l and
{ [11, . . . , MI.
To represent the inheritance of the complements,
here OmU+0&apos;m, we use a mechanism of argument
composition inspired by (Hinrichs and Nakazawa,
1994): the conjunction et takes as complements the
two conjuncts &lt; C1, . . . , Cm &gt; and &lt; q, . . . , CM &gt;
which may remain unsaturated for their comple-
ments Om and 01m, and the set Om/1-1-0M. The
coordination of m-tuples, as well as the coordination
of simple conjuncts (M = 1) stems from the satura-
tion of the conjunction et. As noted in 4.1., only the
last element of the tuple Cm (or CM) can be unsat-
urated and be the source of inheritance. Example of
resulting HPSG-like analysis is given in figure 1 for
the underlined phrase in (15).

We have now to define how arguments satisfy dis-

a (possibly disjunctive) argument specification, an
argument (possibly composite) satisfies cei if each
element of the composite category matches one dis-
junct of ai. Then, if 0 is a n-requirement, a tuple
(or a coordination of tuples) of categories (possibly
composite) satisfies 0 if each element of the tuple
(for each tuple) satisfies one and only one argument
specification of O. More formally:

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99889028">
This approach based on concept of functor, argu-
ment and subcategorization allows us to account for
many coordination data. Its formalization comprises
two parts which are conceptually independent. On
one hand, we have extended the feature structure
unification to disjunctive and set values in order to
check the compatibility and the satisfiability of sub-
categorization requirements by structured comple-
ments. On the other hand, we have considered the
conjunction et as the head of the coordinate struc-
ture, so that coordinate structures stem simply from
the subcategorization specifications of et and a gen-
eral schemata of the head saturation. Both parts
have been encoded within HPSG using the same re-
source that is the subcategorization and its principle
which we have just extended.
It remains to know in which extent our ap-
proach can be used for other linguistic phenomena
with symetrical sequences of more than one con-
stituent (comparative constructions, alternative con-
structions):

Note that the unification of two n-requirements is ambiguous because we may have several permutations which lead to success. 4.3 How coordinate structures are built Until now we have just defined constraints on the coordinate structures but we did not mention how these structures are built. We want that a coordinate structure inherits features from its conjuncts without necessarily failing in case of conflicting values. The generalization method (Sag et al., 1985) has this objective but overgenerates because the conflicting values are ignored. In contrast, the use of composite categories (Cooper, 1991) keeps conflicting values within the connective &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;.

We begin by formulating constraints on coordinate structures, then we define how to build the coordinate structures and we end by specifying how the previous constraints filter through such coordinate structures. 4.1 Constraints on coordinate structures In order to precisely formulate the constraints on coordinate structures, we distinguish the role of functor and that of argument, where functor categories are those that bear unsatisfied subcategorization requirements, as it is the case in Categorial Grammars (Dowty, 1988). Lexical heads (1) are functors in relation to the arguments they select and, by composition, any expression that contains an unsaturated functor is a functor (5)-(7). head4. An argument may often be realized by different categories. For example, the argument required by savoir (to know) may be a NP or a Completive: we say that the requirement is disjunctive and we represent the different alternatives within subcategorization feature disjunctive values. An argument specification is then a disjunction of categories. When the lexical head requires several complements (to ask somebody something)</context>

An argument specification is then a disjunction of categories. When the lexical head requires several complements (to ask somebody something), the requirement is said multiple or n-requirement. To the extent that disjunction only appears in argument specifications, a n-requirement is a multi-set of simple requirements. The choice of set (or more precisely multiset) rather than list value for the feature SUBCAT allows us to account for Je demande a Pierre son velo as well as Je demande son velo a Pierre. Gunji (Gunji, 1987) makes the same choice. However our criterion can be formalized in a theory whose order of arguments obeys to an obliqueness hierarchy. Requirement inheritance. A functor may compose with another functor or with arguments. In functor-arguments composition, the resulting expression inherits the unsatisfied requirement from the functor when it is not empty. For example, in (5), both conjuncts inherit the unsatisfied requirement from their heads. Likewise the functor composition inherits a requirement from the unsatisfied functor5.

However, the functor this coordinate structure (partially-)saturates may impose its own LPconstraint (e.g. an obliqueness hierarchy). In such a case, this LP-constraint has to be satisfied simultaneously by the two sets f[1], ... , [M]l and { [11, . . . , MI. To represent the inheritance of the complements, here OmU+0&apos;m, we use a mechanism of argument composition inspired by (Hinrichs and Nakazawa, 1994): the conjunction et takes as complements the two conjuncts &lt; C1, . . . , Cm &gt; and &lt; q, . . . , CM &gt; which may remain unsaturated for their complements Om and 01m, and the set Om/1-1-0M. The coordination of m-tuples, as well as the coordination of simple conjuncts (M = 1) stems from the saturation of the conjunction et. As noted in 4.1., only the last element of the tuple Cm (or CM) can be unsaturated and be the source of inheritance.

To account for the continuum which exists from strictly subcategorized complements to adjuncts, we adopt the hypothesis suggested by (Miller, 1991) according to which adjuncts could be accorded the same status as arguments by integrating them into the subcategorization requirement through an optional lexical rule. That would enable us to account for coordination of adjuncts of different categories (3) as well as coordination of more than one constituent with adjuncts (10)-(11) below. Note that we may still have a special feature ADJUNCT in order to distinguish adjuncts from other complements if necessary.

This structuring is encoded later within the definition of the lexical entry of et. Lexicalization of the coordination rule. We consider, as in (Paritong, 1992), the conjunction et as the head of the coordinate structure. Consequently, coordinate structures no longer have to be postulated in the grammar by a special rule of coordination: they stem simply from the general 6This condition will forbid the conjunction of e.g. verbs with S1JBCAT lists of different lengths, but which would have a unification under the alternative interpretation, thus avoiding sentences like *John bought and gave the book to Mary, (Miller, 1991). schemata of the head saturation and the subcategorization specifications of the conjunction.

We focus here on the coordination of syntagmatic categories (as opposite of lexical categories). More precisely, we account for cases of non constituent coordination (4), of Right Node Raising (5) but not for cases of Gapping. Our approach which is independent of any framework, is easily and precisely encoded in the formalism of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994), which is based on the notion of head and makes available the feature sharing mechanism we need. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief description of basic data and discusses some constraints and available structures. Section 3 summarizes previous approaches and section 4 is devoted to our approach. The french coordination with et serves throughout the paper as an example. 124 2 A brief description of Basic Data and Constraints The classical typology of coordination, i.e. coordination of constituents (1) and of non-constituents, hides some regularity of the phenomenon as </context>

Indeed, according to this approach (Chomsky, 1957; Banfield, 1981), only coordination of sentences are basic and other syntagmatic coordinations should be considered as coordinations of reduced sentences, the reduction being performed by deleting repeated elements. This approach comes up 125 against insurmountable obstacles, chiefly with the problem of applying transformation in reverse, in the analysis process (Schachter, 1973). A direct approach has been proposed at once by Sag &amp; al. (Sag et al., 1985) within the framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG), by (Pollard and Sag, 1994) within HPSG, and (Bresnan, 1986) within Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG). These approaches have tried to account for coordination of different categories in reducing the constraint from requiring the same category for conjuncts to a weaker constraint of category compatibility. Whatever the nature of subcategorization information may be, syntactical in GPSG, hybrid in HPSG, functional in LFG, two categories are compatible if they subsume a &amp;quot;common denominator&amp;quot;, in this case a common partial structure. Technically, the compatibility is checked by computing a &amp;quot;generalization&amp;quot; of categories and i</context>

In the first case, the extended lexicon is pre-computed and requires no runtime application. &apos;In this paper, we restrict arguments to complements. In our HPSG encoding, they are treated in the SUBCAT feature. In a Borsley-like manner, we suppose a special feature for the subject. However, our approach can be generalized to subjects. 5In functor composition, functors cannot be both unsaturated: * 11 promet de manger a sa mere des bananes.(* he promises to eat his mother bananas.), cf. the Incomplete Constituent Constraint (Pollard and Sag, 1994).

Arguments are the complements selected by the 126 Satisfiability conditions of requirements. We observe here that a coordination of different categories may appear as head complement when the head requirement is disjunctive and a coordination of more than one constituent appears when such a requirement is multiple. Last, functors may conjoin when their sub categorization requirements are compatible. These observations are synthesized in one coordination criterion. The first</context>

Note that the unification of two n-requirements is ambiguous because we may have several permutations which lead to success. 4.3 How coordinate structures are built Until now we have just defined constraints on the coordinate structures but we did not mention how these structures are built. We want that a coordinate structure inherits features from its conjuncts without necessarily failing in case of conflicting values. The generalization method (Sag et al., 1985) has this objective but overgenerates because the conflicting values are ignored. In contrast, the use of composite categories (Cooper, 1991) keeps conflicting values within the connective &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;. Intuitively, if son age (her age) is a NP and qu&apos;elle est venue ici (that she came here) is a Completive, son age qu&apos;elle est venue ici (her age and that she came here) is a conjunctive composite category NPACompl.
