In this paper, we present a treebank anno-
tation tool developed for processing Turk-
ish sentences. The tool consists of three
different annotation stages; morphological
analysis, morphological disambiguation and
syntax analysis. Each of these stages are
integrated with existing analyzers in order
to guide human annotators. Our semi-
automatic treebank annotation tool is cur-
rently used both for creating new data sets
and correcting the existing Turkish treebank.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99982303125">
Annotated corpora is essential for most of the nat-
ural language processing tasks. Developing new
annotated corpora becomes crucial especially for
lesser studied languages where we encounter many
difficulties for finding such data. Turkish is one
of the languages which still suffer from scarcity
of annotated resources. The most reliable data set
for Turkish is the Metu-Sabancı Turkish Treebank
(Oflazer et al., 2003) consisting of 5635 sentences
annotated with dependency structures. Unfortu-
nately, the data size of this treebank remained un-
changed during recent years. There exist also some
other small data sets manually pos-tagged by differ-
ent research groups.
In this study, we introduce our treebank annota-
tion tool developed in order to improve the size of
the existing data sets for Turkish (particularly the
treebank). Our main motivation for developing a
new tool is the inability of the existing tools (e.g.
Atalay et al. (2003) and DepAnn (Kakkonen, 2006)
which seems to be the most suitable tools for our
task) in either reflecting the peculiar morphologi-
cal and dependency structure of Turkish or provid-
ing suitable automatic analyses for guidance. We
also aim to speed up the annotation process by using
graphical user-friendly interfaces and transforming
the annotation process from a manual (starting from
scratch) procedure into a controlling and correcting
procedure. In the rest of this paper, we first intro-
duce the framework of the tool and then the details
of its different annotation stages. We then close with
conclusions and future work.

the state of the art dependency parsers.
The tool consists of three levels of annotation
and can be used to produce results for each of
them; these are morphological analysis, morpho-
logical disambiguation and syntax analysis stages.
Each of these stages uses plugins in order to guide
the human annotators (referred as annotators in the
remaining part). Figure 1 gives the data flow be-
tween the annotation stages and the plugins which
will be explained in detail in the following sections.

3 Morphological Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999695409090909">
The most important characteristic of Turkish which
distinguishes it from most of the well-studied lan-
guages is its very rich morphological structure.
Turkish which is an agglutinative language has a
very productive derivational and inflectional mor-
phology. This rich structure of the language has
been represented in the literature (Oflazer et al.,
2003; Hakkani-T¨ur et al., 2002; Eryi˘git and Oflazer,
2006) by splitting the words into inflectional groups
(IGs) which are separated from each other by deriva-
tional boundaries. Each IG is then annotated with its
own part-of-speech and inflectional features.
We are using the morphological analyzer of
Oflazer (1994) which provides all the possible mor-
phological analyses together with the IG structure.
The output provided by the morphological analyzer
for each word in the example sentence “S¸imdi eski
odandayım.” (I’m now in your old room.) can be
seen from Figure 2 (the listed items under each
word with radio buttons in front). We can see from
the figure that the derived word “odandayım” (I’m
in your room) is composed of two IGs:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.810756666666667">
(1,”oda+Noun+A3sg+P2sg+Loc”) (2,”Verb+Zero+Pres+A1sg”)
\ V J \ Y J
IG1 IG2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999194928571429">
The first IG is the noun “oda” (room) which
takes the meaning of “in your room” after taking
the 3rd singular number-person agreement (+A3sg) ,
2nd person possessive agreement (+P2sg) and loca-
tive case (+Loc) inflectional features. The sec-
ond IG is the derived verb “being in your room”
in present tense (+Pres), with 1st singular number-
person agreement (+A1sg) inflectional features1.
The morphological analysis stage is totally auto-
matic except that the user can enter other analyses
to the text boxes under each word if the correct one
is not within the above listed items or the analyzer
couldn’t suggest any analysis. This latter case gen-
erally occurs for numerical values (e.g., numbers,

dates) and unknown words. For numerical values,
we use a preprocessor to produce the analysis, but
for unknown words, the annotators are asked to en-
ter the appropriate analysis.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.995137" genericHeader="method">
4 Morphological Disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977214285715">
The second stage is the morphological disambigua-
tion where the annotator is asked to choose one of
the possible analyses for each word. The annota-
tor may consult to an automatic analyzer by clicking
the checkbox at the top of the screen in Figure 2.
In this case we activate the part-of-speech tagger of
Y¨uret and T¨ure (2006) which uses some rules auto-
matically derived from a training corpus. The results
of this tagger is reflected to the screen by selecting
automatically the appropriate radio button for each
word. After finishing the disambiguation, the anno-
tator saves the results in XML format (shown at the
bottom panel of Figure 2) and proceeds trough the
syntax analysis.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.981576" genericHeader="method">
5 Syntax Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992688">
The syntactic annotation scheme used in the Turk-
ish treebank is the dependency grammar represen-
tation. The aim of the dependency analysis is to
find the binary relationships between dependent and
head units. The dependency structure of Turkish
has been mentioned in many studies (Oflazer et al.,
2003; Oflazer, 2003; Eryi˘git et al., 2006) and it is
argued that for Turkish, it is not just enough to de-
termine the relationships between words and one
should also determine the relationships between in-
flectional groups. Figure 3 gives an example of this
structure2. In this screen, the annotator first selects
a dependent unit by selecting the check box under it
and then a head unit and the appropriate dependency
relation from the combo box appearing under the
constructed dependency. In this figure, we see that
the adjective “eski” (old) is connected to the first IG
of the word “odandayım” since it is the word “oda”
(room) which is modified by the adjective, not the
derived verb form “odandayım” (I’m in your room).
On the other hand, the adverb “sjimdi” (now) is con-
nected to the second IG of this word and modifies the
verb “being in the room”. The graphical interface is
designed so that the annotator can easily determine
the correct head word and its correct IG.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.577784">
2The arrows in the figure indicates the dependencies ema-
nating from the dependent unit towards the head unit.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970135">
In each step of the syntactic annotation, the par-
tially built dependency tree is shown to the anno-
tators in order to reduce the number of mistakes
caused by the inattentiveness of the annotators (such
as the errors encountered in the original Turkish
treebank; cycled dependencies, erroneous crossing
dependencies, unconnected items, dependencies to
nonexistent items). Extra cautions are taken with
similar reasons in order to force the annotators to
only make valid annotations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.941347142857143">
• Only the check boxes under final IGs of the
words become active when the annotator is
about to select a dependent since the dependen-
cies can only emanate from the last IGs of the
dependents.
• The dependents may only be connected to the
IGs of other words, thus the check boxes of the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970905153846154">
IGs within the dependent word become passive
when selecting a head unit.
Similar to the morphological disambiguation
stage, the annotator may want to consult to an auto-
matic analyzer. We use the data-driven dependency
parser of Nivre et al. (2006) as an external parsing
guide which is shown to give the highest accuracy
for Turkish and for many other languages. The out-
put of the parser (pre-trained on the Turkish tree-
bank) is reflected to the screen by automatically con-
structing the dependency tree. The annotator may
then change the dependencies which he/she finds in-
correct.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999326">
ITU treebank annotation tool is a semi-automatic
annotation tool tailored for the particular morpho-
logical structure of Turkish where we need to an-
notate units smaller than words. It has three an-
notation levels and uses pluggable analyzers in or-
der to automate these levels. These are a rule-based
morphological analyzer, and machine learning based
part-of-speech tagger and dependency parser. The
tool which aims to provide a user-friendly platform
for the human annotators, also tries to minimize the
number of errors due to the complexity of the anno-
tation process of Turkish. The tool is designed and
used only for Turkish in its current state, however
it can be used for other languages with similar mor-
phological structure (particularly other Turkic lan-

guages) by replacing the external analyzers. By us-
ing this tool, we observed significant acceleration
both in correcting the existing treebank and devel-
oping new data sets. However education of new hu-
man annotators still remains as a difficult point and
requires a lot of time. Hence in the future, we aim to
develop online education tools which teach the an-
notators and tests their performance. We also aim to
carry the platform to the web and supply an environ-
ment which can be reached from different places by
volunteer researchers and collect the data in a single
place.

After finishing the disambiguation, the annotator saves the results in XML format (shown at the bottom panel of Figure 2) and proceeds trough the syntax analysis. 5 Syntax Analysis The syntactic annotation scheme used in the Turkish treebank is the dependency grammar representation. The aim of the dependency analysis is to find the binary relationships between dependent and head units. The dependency structure of Turkish has been mentioned in many studies (Oflazer et al., 2003; Oflazer, 2003; Eryi˘git et al., 2006) and it is argued that for Turkish, it is not just enough to determine the relationships between words and one should also determine the relationships between inflectional groups. Figure 3 gives an example of this structure2. In this screen, the annotator first selects a dependent unit by selecting the check box under it and then a head unit and the appropriate dependency relation from the combo box appearing under the constructed dependency. In this figure, we see that the adjective “eski” (old) is connected to the first IG of the word “odandayım” since it is the word </context>
