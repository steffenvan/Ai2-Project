Argument Realization presents a thorough survey of current theories that deal with the
relationship between verbs and their arguments. It addresses the problem of argument
realization in its many aspects such as semantic roles, lexical semantic representation,
conceptualizations of events, thematic hierarchies, and verb alternations. This is a lin-
guistics book and therefore geared toward researchers in syntax and semantics. Nev-
ertheless, this extensive and clearly presented body of work by Levin and Rappaport
Hovav deserves a prominent place in computational linguistics libraries.
The book is organized into three broad parts. The first part reviews current theories
of semantic roles, lexical semantic representation, and event structures. The second part
focuses on the mapping from lexical semantics to syntax and on thematic hierarchies.
The last part examines perspectives on multiple argument realization.
Chapter 1 presents a good survey of linguistic theories and their different ways
of explaining syntactic similarities in language. It discusses proposed strategies of
isolating semantic components of verbs and the fact that these meaning components
cannot be taken in isolation to explain syntactic behavior. The chapter concentrates on
the problems that must be taken into account when developing a theory of argument
realization and a related theory of lexical semantic representation. It discusses the im-
portance of viewing verb meanings as construals of happenings and explores the variety
and uniformity in argument realization through cross-linguistic examples showing that
argument realization involves more than just the agent and patient roles.
Chapter 2 introduces work on semantic role lists and examines in detail their
properties. This chapter includes a discussion on the limitations of semantic role list
representations, in particular: (1) the difficulty of determining the right granularity
for defining semantic roles; (2) the lack of internal structure of the typical semantic
role inventory and the fact that cross-linguistic examples attest similarities between
certain roles (e.g., patient and recipients, goals and benefactives); and (3) the problem
of assigning a single instance of each role per clause and, if this constraint is relaxed,
why only some pairings of roles are possible. Even with these limitations, Levin and
Rappaport Hovav still maintain the notion that semantic roles are an appropriate basis
for a lexical semantic representation. This chapter also reviews proposed efforts to solve
these limitations through decomposition of semantic roles into binary features, and by
allowing arguments to be assigned more than one semantic role.
Chapter 3 reviews other current notions of semantic role representation. It presents
in detail Dowty’s (1991) approach on proto-roles, pointing out some of the limitations
of this work. It compares this work to Schlesinger (1995) emphasizing potential benefits
of the prototypical approach and presents an extensive survey of approaches that
extended Dowty’s. This chapter also introduces the approach taken by Van Valin (1990)
Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 3
of “generalized semantic roles,” more coarse-grained roles called macroroles within
that framework. The two macroroles proposed, Actor and Undergoer, tend to show up
mainly in subject and object positions and can be considered generalizations of com-
monly used semantic roles such as agent, experiencer, patient, and location. The second
part of this chapter introduces the idea of adding more structure to the lexical semantic
representation by means of predicate decomposition. The authors argue that this is a
preferable representation for semantic roles — first, because predicate decomposition
allows for distinctions between the root and the event structure part of the verb, which
lexical entailments do not; second, because it provides relations between arguments
that help explain why only certain arguments can occur together; and third, because it
allows a representation of sub-events.
Chapter 4 presents three approaches to event conceptualization and discusses their
merits in argument realization. The first is the localist approach as described by Gruber
(1965) and further developed by Jackendoff (1990). This approach supports the idea that
events of motion and location are central to understanding all events and that their com-
ponents can be extrapolated for events that are not of motion or location. However, this
approach does not seem to have criteria for assigning particular roles to arguments. The
second approach described is the aspectual approach, in which argument realization is
based on temporal and mereological properties of the predicates that describe events.
Aspectual properties such as telicity, measure, and incremental theme appear to help in
the selection of components of transitivity and argument realization, especially in the
choice and expression of direct objects. The third approach is the causal approach in
which events are modeled as causal chains, a series of segments that relate participants
in an event. Most of the causal approaches described are inspired by Talmy’s work
on causation (Talmy 1976, 1988). This work seems to be directly related to semantic
role lists that provide a representation of an event in terms of its participants and the
relationships among them.
In Chapter 5, the authors present existing hypotheses about the nature of the
mapping from lexical semantics to syntax. These hypotheses make the assumption that
certain aspects of the lexical representation, such as the equivalence classes that the
representation defines and prominence relations among arguments, must be preserved
in syntax. The last part of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of two broad classes
of algorithms for mapping the lexical semantic representation to the syntax: hierarchy-
aligning and bidirectional algorithms. These two classes of mapping algorithms and
the ranking of semantic roles in a thematic hierarchy are mutually interdependent and
the formulation of the mapping algorithm greatly depends on the syntactic theory.
Chapter 6 analyzes in depth the notion of thematic hierarchies and shows several
such proposed hierarchies. The discussion is based on the premise that different organi-
zations for the thematic hierarchy can be compared only if the ranking among the roles
is given the same interpretation and the ranking is intended to explain the same range of
phenomena. Several formulations of thematic hierarchies inspired by Baker (1996) and
Macfarland (1991) are presented, and the focus is on their disagreement on where to
place the patient/theme role with respect to other roles, especially the spatial roles such
as goal and location. This chapter ends with the conclusion that although all hierarchies
establish rankings of arguments, it is not possible to formulate a thematic hierarchy that
captures all possible generalizations involving the realization of arguments in terms of
their semantic roles.
Chapter 7 is devoted to multiple argument realization and its manifestation as
argument alternations. This is perhaps the most interesting chapter from a computa-
tional linguistics perspective, given that the relationship between argument alternations

and verb classes has drawn much interest in the development of computational lexical
resources. This chapter reviews the projectionist and constructional perspectives of
multiple argument realization as introduced by Goldberg (1995) and Borer (2003), re-
spectively. In both approaches the verb’s root has a core meaning that is then combined
with event-based meanings represented or associated with syntactic constructions or
with the meaning encoded in the syntactic structure. The authors present analyses
of multiple argument realization involving event composition exemplified by verbs
taking resultative constructions. In the last section, the challenges of predicting the
distribution of verbs in particular instances of multiple argument realization and a
theoretical explanation of the limited productivity of these alternations are addressed.
Levin and Rappaport Hovav establish a very clear and easy-to-follow line of ar-
gumentation that starts with the problems of semantic roles and their realization in
morphosyntax and ends with the conclusion that it is not possible to establish a single
hierarchy of thematic roles that would account for all phenomena in argument realiza-
tion. This is a very comprehensive survey with an enormous amount of background
work and useful notes and citations.
I would recommend this book to students and researchers of linguistics and compu-
tational linguistics, especially those interested in the several facets of lexical semantics
and their morphosyntactic realizations. Some chapters of this book are likely to be used
in computational linguistics courses and can provide interesting discussion topics for
study groups.

The discussion is based on the premise that different organizations for the thematic hierarchy can be compared only if the ranking among the roles is given the same interpretation and the ranking is intended to explain the same range of phenomena. Several formulations of thematic hierarchies inspired by Baker (1996) and Macfarland (1991) are presented, and the focus is on their disagreement on where to place the patient/theme role with respect to other roles, especially the spatial roles such as goal and location. This chapter ends with the conclusion that although all hierarchies establish rankings of arguments, it is not possible to formulate a thematic hierarchy that captures all possible generalizations involving the realization of arguments in terms of their semantic roles. Chapter 7 is devoted to multiple argument realization and its manifestation as argument alternations. This is perhaps the most interesting chapter fr</context>

Even with these limitations, Levin and Rappaport Hovav still maintain the notion that semantic roles are an appropriate basis for a lexical semantic representation. This chapter also reviews proposed efforts to solve these limitations through decomposition of semantic roles into binary features, and by allowing arguments to be assigned more than one semantic role. Chapter 3 reviews other current notions of semantic role representation. It presents in detail Dowty’s (1991) approach on proto-roles, pointing out some of the limitations of this work. It compares this work to Schlesinger (1995) emphasizing potential benefits of the prototypical approach and presents an extensive survey of approaches that extended Dowty’s. This chapter also introduces the approach taken by Van Valin (1990) Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 3 of “generalized semantic roles,” more coarse-grained roles called macroroles within that framework. The two macroroles proposed, Actor and Undergoer, tend to show up mainly in subject and object positions and can be considered generalizations of commonly used semantic roles such as agent, experiencer, patient, and location.

Aspectual properties such as telicity, measure, and incremental theme appear to help in the selection of components of transitivity and argument realization, especially in the choice and expression of direct objects. The third approach is the causal approach in which events are modeled as causal chains, a series of segments that relate participants in an event. Most of the causal approaches described are inspired by Talmy’s work on causation (Talmy 1976, 1988). This work seems to be directly related to semantic role lists that provide a representation of an event in terms of its participants and the relationships among them. In Chapter 5, the authors present existing hypotheses about the nature of the mapping from lexical semantics to syntax. These hypotheses make the assumption that certain aspects of the lexical representation, such as the equivalence classes that the representation defines and prominence relations among arguments, must be preserved in syntax. The last part of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of two broad classes of</context>
