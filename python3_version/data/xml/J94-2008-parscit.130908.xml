Most of the computer-based writing tools
presently in use are quite dumb, relying
on simple techniques to achieve their goals;
however, development of intelligent writing
aids is an important area in computational
linguistics. Two recent books address many
of the issues involved in the development of
better writing tools.
Computers and Writing: State of the Art
(CWSA), and Computers and Writing: Issues
and Implementations (CWII) contain papers
from the Third International Conference on
Computers and Writing and the Fourth Con-
ference on Computers and the Writing Pro-
cess, respectively. The second book contains
selected papers, which were further devel-
oped by the authors for publication. It is not
clear whether the papers in the first volume
underwent the same selection process, but
the time that elapsed between the confer-
ence and the publication of the book suggests
that the papers might have been revised since
their presentation at the conference.
The papers cover a wide range of
subtopics; as Sharples observes in his intro-
duction, &amp;quot;This volume is deliberately eclec-
tic&amp;quot; (CWII, p. 3). Research interests of par-
ticipants include cognitive science, computer
science, education, engineering, linguistics,
and philosophy. The majority of the contrib-
utors are from the United Kingdom.
CWII contains an introduction by the edi-
tor and 15 papers; CWSA contains a preface
by Holt and 24 papers. Neither book has a
concluding chapter to tie the strands together
in any way, so the reader may go away with a
sense of having been left hanging at the end.
Perhaps the absence of concluding chapters
is due to the difficulty of drawing any gen-
eral conclusions from such a wide spectrum
of topics. They range from designing writing
tools to assessing educational tools, from ob-
serving writing practices to writing interac-
tive fiction. Thus, many of the chapters might
not be of interest to any one reader, unless
that reader wants to gain an overview of the
issues that are currently being explored.
Most of the papers in the two books can be
(very) loosely divided into three categories:
the effects of the computer on writing prac-
tices; CAI for writing; and the development
of computer writing tools. Neither of the
books has a computational linguistics focus.
About one-fifth of the papers in each describe
the application of natural language process-
ing techniques. For the most part, only cur-
rent, reliable capabilities are applied to create
working systems. I will briefly discuss a few
of the papers that describe the implementa-
tion of NLP techniques, to give an idea of
how they are being used.
Kempen and Vosse (CWSA) present a
&amp;quot;language-sensitive&amp;quot; text editor for Dutch.
Their system focuses on detecting real-word
spelling errors that are homophonous to the
target word, as well as flagging inconsis-
tent spellings and other orthographical er-
rors. The text undergoes both word-level
and sentence-level analyses. At the word
level, triphone analysis is performed to se-
lect all possible homophonous word alter-
natives. Next, a shift-reduce parser analyzes
each sentence. The parser, which contains
about 500 augmented phrase structure rules,
ignores aspects of syntactic structure that are
not relevant to orthography. Feature matrices
on the nortterminal symbols detect feature vi-
olations. The evaluation of the system is only
preliminary, but it appears to be a practical
solution to the problem of discovering many
real-word errors using current parsing capa-
bilities.

Briefly Noted
oped to aid manual writers at Boeing. A to-
kenizer, a lexicon, and a parser using a Gen-
eralized Phase Structure Grammar are used
to enforce vocabulary, grammar, and style re-
strictions that require only syntactic analysis.
The authors intend to eventually add seman-
tic and pragmatic modules to help resolve
ambiguity and enforce meaning restrictions
on allowable vocabulary. Their comparison
of manual writers rewriting text into simpli-
fied English with or without the checker sug-
gests that this difficult task will be made eas-
ier with this automated support. However,
the examples of the error messages given
for various sentences reveal that the sug-
gested alternatives are not sufficient for users
to easily translate &amp;quot;unsimplified&amp;quot; English to
simplified English, since only word replace-
ments are given when often a reformulation
of the sentence is necessary. In any case, cur-
rent parsers seem well suited to the limita-
tions imposed by simplified grammars.
Forster and Van Nest (CWII) describe a
prototype for a hypertext-based tool to aid in
the on-line expansion of design briefs—short
descriptions of artifacts, which are later elab-
orated upon to produce more detailed de-
scriptions. Their system has various compo-
nents aimed at avoiding the main difficulty
associated with design brief expansion: link-
ing a semantic entity in the design brief to re-
quirement specifications. The most important
component in this system is the chunker—a
chart parser with a semantically augmented
grammar—which is used to chunk briefs into
smaller phrases, extracting the longest syn-
tactically correct ones that are semantically
relevant to the user. Only a shallow semantic
understanding is achieved, to ensure that the
speed of the parser is reasonable. The aim of
the chunker is to present the designer with
any relevant phrases and enough context
from the design brief to be able to expand
upon all requirement specifications without
having to refer back to the original docu-
ment. The authors claim that this method is
superior to a simple keyword search with
a window of words on either side because
the chunker provides a syntactically com-
plete context. However, whether there is ac-
tually a significant difference between these
two approaches has not been tested.
One of the problems I found in perusing
these volumes was the lack of overt orga-
nization of the papers. This seems to have
been intentional, and perhaps necessary, be-
cause of the variety of subjects, but I found
the absence of chapters grouped into sec-
tions rather bewildering. There is a logical
sequence from one paper to the next, but the
topics are so diverse that predicting where a
particular paper might be is almost impos-
sible, unless one happens to be reading an
adjacent one. Finding papers is particularly
confusing in CWII, because of the absence of
chapter numbering. Also, neither volume has
an index to help alleviate the confusion; each
paper does, however, have an abstract.
The editing of CWSA is poor. There are
numerous typographical errors (mainly real-
word errors), and the text of some of the non-
native English writers contains many syn-
tactically awkward and some incorrect con-
structions (see Andersen and Holmqvist&apos;s
paper, for example). The book thus inadver-
tently illustrates the need for the develop-
ment of good language-sensitive text editors.
There are also many spacing errors, incon-
sistencies, arid irregularities, particularly in
several figures. Some of the papers in CWII
would have been improved with some minor
syntactic revisions (e.g., Andeweg, Hoekstra,
de Jong, and Kunst), but this volume was
generally free from typographical errors.
These books are obviously intended for a
general audience. Although I have focused in
this review on areas of interest to computa-
tional linguists, most of the issues discussed
in these volumes will only whet the appetite
of readers with specific interests. Computa-
tional linguists who want to develop writing
tools for use in the near future may be in-
spired by the conservative but successful ap-
plication of present NLP capabilities. Those
who are seeking new research projects might
also be inspired by the variety of ideas and
the obvious need to take some of them sev-
eral steps further to create truly intelligent
tools for writers.—Angela Glover, Ontario In-
stitute for Studies in Education

Multilingual Multimedia: Bridging the
Language Barrier with Intelligent Sys-

Multilingual Multimedia contains a few pos-
sibly interesting ideas, but they are lost in
the hype, the redundancy, the poor presen-
tation, and the failure to distinguish spec-
ulation from completed research that char-
acterize the book. Properly edited and pre-
sented, the material in this book might have
made an interesting journal paper and a cou-
ple of good proposals to submit to a funding
agency.
Most of Multilingual Multimedia is a report
of a long-term project to build systems—
LINGER (Language INdependent Grammati-
cal Error Reporter) and its descendent eL (en-
hanced LINGER)—that would assist learn-
ers of a second language by detecting syn-
tactic errors in their writing and helping the
students to correct them. LINGER was first
implemented for French, and, having been
judged &amp;quot;general enough to be a good ba-
sis for other Romance Languages&amp;quot; (p. 60),
it was then extended for &amp;quot;Italian, Spanish,
German, and English&amp;quot; But despite the
title of the book, the systems are not multilin-
gual in the sense of dealing with more than
one language at a time. Nor are they mul-
timedia; that part is admitted to be still in
the early stages of development (p. 1). And
they are language-independent only in that
language-dependent knowledge is confined
to the lexicon and grammar modules, as one
would expect in any parser. Although there
is mention of the systems being tested with
students, they apparently remain prototypes.
The story of LINGER and eL is presented
as a 150-page sequence of chapters that ap-
pear to be papers and reports written as the
project progressed, with no attempt to in-
tegrate them or to eliminate redundancies
and out-of-date information. For example,
the chapter by Yazdani and Uren, originally
published in 1988, speaks of work then in
progress and future plans for the system
(p. 70). O&apos;Brien&apos;s chapter is written in the
style of a project report by an undergradu-
ate who has yet to master the basics of En-
glish punctuation. It consumes more than a
quarter of the book, giving equal emphasis
to the important points (the system&apos;s heuris-
tics for correcting syntax errors), the conven-
tional (morphological analysis), and the triv-
ial (the necessity of the period at the end of
Prolog clauses).
The one chapter in this sequence that is not
in need of serious revision is Bolt&apos;s, in which
English-language LINGER is compared with
six commercial grammar checkers on a cor-
pus of errors said to be typical of language
learners. Some of the test sentences are al-
most word salad; for example, An young
dog arent eats the smelly fish. Not surprisingly,
LINGER did better than the commercial pro-
grams, which are intended primarily for flu-
ent or near-fluent users of English and are
not so rigorous in trying to produce a full
parse of each sentence. Bolt analyzes the ar-
chitecture of the various programs, and con-
cludes that it is inherent in the design of
the commercial programs that they are un-
suitable for use as an aid to language learn-
ers. LINGER is not without its problems ei-
ther. Long sentences can be troublesome for
LINGER (p. 145), and the corrections it sug-
gests are not always those that assume the
fewest errors; for example, This books is very
old is corrected to These books are very old in-
stead of This book is very old (pp. 150-151).
But throughout these chapters, it is never
made clear what is supposed to be so spe-
cial about LINGER. Parsing ill-formed input
and diagnosing syntactic errors have, after
all, been well-established research topics for
more than a decade.&apos; But none of the papers
in this book, not even Bolt&apos;s, makes any com-
parison with other research. In fact, none ac-
knowledge that it exists.
The other four chapters of the book are
merely research proposals. They are, at
1 See, for example, the special issue of the AJCL
(1983) on ill-formed input. The well-known
EPISTLE project on parse fitting arid text
critiquing (later named CRITIQUE) is described
by Jensen, Heidorn, Miller, and Ravin (1983)
and Ravin (1988). Catt and Hirst (1990)
describe a system with pedagogical
motivations similar to those of LINGER that
includes new methods for syntactic error
diagnosis and uses a grammar of the student&apos;s
native language to check for interference from
that language when explaining errors—a
method first applied by Schuster (1986). The
same idea is mentioned on page 206 of the
present book as a planned extension of eL.

least, better matched to the title Multilin-
gual &apos;Vim/ timedia. Pollard and Yazdani pro-
pose a HyperCard front-end to eL in which
the student would be led through simple
dialogs with text, pictures, and recorded
speech in a choice of languages. Only a
small demonstration prototype has been im-
plemented. Yazdani and Pollard propose
the creation of a multilingual, multimedia
database of &amp;quot;learning materials,&amp;quot; in a discus-
sion that brings together pedagogical, polit-
ical, and user-interface considerations. And
in two chapters (the second of which re-
peats much of the material of the first),
Mealing and Yazdani propose language-
independent computer-mediated communi-
cation using icons instead of natural lan-
guage. By returning a form that is printed
in the book, one may obtain a demonstration
disk with a HyperCard stack showing how a
hotel booking might be negotiated in such a
set-up.
The book is attractively designed and type-
set (which is all too rare when camera-ready
pages are produced by the authors), and
except for O&apos;Brien&apos;s chapter and the edi-
tor&apos;s preface, most of the text appears to
have been copyedited. The appendix referred
to on page 21 is missing, and no index is

In fact, none acknowledge that it exists. The other four chapters of the book are merely research proposals. They are, at 1 See, for example, the special issue of the AJCL (1983) on ill-formed input. The well-known EPISTLE project on parse fitting arid text critiquing (later named CRITIQUE) is described by Jensen, Heidorn, Miller, and Ravin (1983) and Ravin (1988). Catt and Hirst (1990) describe a system with pedagogical motivations similar to those of LINGER that includes new methods for syntactic error diagnosis and uses a grammar of the student&apos;s native language to check for interference from that language when explaining errors—a method first applied by Schuster (1986). The same idea is mentioned on page 206 of the present book as a planned extension of eL. 324 Briefly Noted least, better matched to the title Multilingual &apos;Vim/ timedia.

The book is attractively designed and typeset (which is all too rare when camera-ready pages are produced by the authors), and except for O&apos;Brien&apos;s chapter and the editor&apos;s preface, most of the text appears to have been copyedited.
