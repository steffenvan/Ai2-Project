One of the major problems one is faced
with when decomposing words into their
constituent parts is ambiguity: the gen-
eration of multiple analyses for one input
word, many of which are implausible. In
order to deal with ambiguity, the MOR-
phological PArser MORPA is provided
with a probabilistic context-free grammar
(PCFG), i.e. it combines a &amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot;
context-free morphological grammar to fil-
ter out ungrammatical segmentations with
a probability-based scoring function which
determines the likelihood of each success-
ful parse. Consequently, remaining analy-
ses can be ordered along a scale of plausi-
bility. Test performance data will show that
a PCFG yields good results in morphologi-
cal parsing. MORPA is a fully implemented
parser developed for use in a text-to-speech
conversion system.

MORPA is a MORphological PArser developed for
use in the text-to-speech conversion system for
Dutch, SPRAAKMAKER [van Leeuwen and te Lin-
dert, 1993]. An important step in text-to-speech con-
version is the generation of the correct phonemic re-
presentation on the basis of the input text. As is well-
known, phonemic transcriptions can not be derived

directly from orthographic input in Dutch, as there
is no one-to-one correspondence between graphemes
and phonemes. Also, stress and the effects of most
phonological rules are not reflected in orthography.
A text-to-speech system therefore requires an intel-
ligent method to convert the spelled words of the
input sentence into a phonemic representation.
As far as the pronunciation of words is concerned,
it is impossible to list the entire vocabulary of the
language, because language users have the ability to
create new words and the vocabulary, as such, is in-
definitely large. Daily newspapers, for instance, con-
tain a large amount of newly formed words every day.
Not all of these survive in the long run, but some of
them do. Consider the examples in (1):
(1) golfoorlog &apos;gulf war&apos;
drugsbaron &apos;drugs baron&apos;
vredesmacht &apos;peacekeeping force&apos;
Because it is unfeasible to give the lexicon a daily
update, this approach is not appropriate if the text-
to-speech system is to convert unrestricted text.
Assuming that newly created words will typically
consist of already existing morphemes, and that new
morphemes are added to the language only rarely, we
can, however, use a lexicon in which all Dutch mor-
phemes and their pronunciations are listed. Then
complex words, such as the ones in (1), have to be
decomposed into their constituent parts before their
pronunciation can be looked up.
Since the pronunciation of a word does not always
consists of the concatenation of the pronunciation of
the morphemes, because the pronunciation of mor-
phemes can be modified in certain contexts, the text-
to-speech system also has to be provided with phono-
logical rules which adjust the pronunciation of mor-
phemes according to their context [Allen et al., 1987;

Nunn and van Heuven, 1993].
Dutch phonological rules are in several ways de-
pendent on morphemic segmentation and word class
assignment. As is shown in (2a), for example, the
grapheme d is pronounced voiceless when it occurs
stem-finally, but voiced when it occurs stem-initially.
Final devoicing, the phonological rule which affects
the pronunciation of the d, depends on syllable struc-
ture, and syllabification is sensitive to the morpho-
logical structure of a word: compound boundaries
are also syllable boundaries. This has serious con-
sequences in Dutch, as Dutch compounds are usu-
ally written as one word, i.e. without spaces or hy-
phens in between the parts. Example (2b) shows
that the stress in compounds differs from the stress in
monomorphemic words. In (2c) it is shown that the
stress in (predicatively used) adjectival compounds
differs from the stress in nominal compounds:
(2) a hoofdagent &apos;police sergeant&apos;
hoof[t] + agent
loofdak &apos;roof of foliage&apos;
loof + [d]ak
b avonduur &apos;evening hour&apos;

avontuur &apos;adventure&apos;
avon&apos;tuur
c onecht &apos;unreal&apos;
on + &apos;echt, A
onrecht &apos;injustice&apos;
&apos;on + recht, N
So to be able to produce high quality speech on un-
restricted text, the text- to-speech system SPRAAK-
MAKER contains the morpheme lexicon-based mor-
phological parser MORPA to recover the morphemic
segmentation and word class of the input word. The
module MORPHON [Nunn and van Heuven, 1993]
applies phonological rules which derive the pronun-
ciation of the word by making use of the morpho-
logical information. Also, the word class provided
by MORPA feeds the module for sentence analysis
which serves sentence prosody [Dirksen and Quene,
19931
Our method of morphological analysis comprises a
morpheme lexicon. Assuming that Dutch word for-
mation is concatenative, word or word parts are rec-
ognized by dividing the word into substrings that
correspond to entries in the lexicon. The major prob-
lem this method poses is ambiguity, i.e. the gen-
eration of alternative segmentations and word class
assignments for one input word, many of which are
implausible. In a text-to-speech system, an incor-
rect analysis is unacceptable, because it may lead to
a wrong pronunciation [Nunn and van Heuven, 1993].
In order to deal with ambiguity, MORPA has been
provided with a probabilistic context-free grammar
(PCFG), i.e. it combines a &amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot; context-
free morphological grammar to filter out ungram-
matical segmentations with a probability-based scor-
ing function which determines the likelihood of each
successful parse. Then, aiming at a system that gen-
erates the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; analysis first, the remaining anal-
yses are ordered along a scale of plausibility. In this
paper, I will separately describe the rule-based dis-
ambiguation techniques and probability-based scor-
ing function. Illustrative performance data obtained
from an evaluation will show that a probabilistic
context-free grammar yields good results in morpho-
logical parsing.

Decomposition of the input word is carried out in
two successive stages. First, all the possible seg-
mentations of an input word into strings of stems
and affixes are generated. Secondly, each segmenta-
tion is tested for morpho-syntactic well-formedness.
While the well-formedness is tested, word class is de-
termined.
The task of recovering the morphemic segmentation
with the help of a morpheme lexicon is very much
complicated by the fact that a word can be seg-
mented in more than one way. The number of alter-
native segmentations for an input word grows with
increasing lexicon size, decreasing average length of
the lexical elements and increasing average length of
the input word. Our lexicon contains 17,087 entries,
among which there is a large number of very small in-
flectional affixes. Furthermore, the input words may
be very lengthy, as Dutch compounds are written
as one word, and because nominal compounding, for
instance, is a highly productive process. The result
can be a combinatorial explosion, causing hundreds
of segmentations to be generated.
In order to restrict ambiguity in the segmentation
stage, we employed a number of strategies. First,
we made a pragmatic operalisation of the theoretical
notion &amp;quot;morpheme&amp;quot;, which is traditionally defined as
&amp;quot;the smallest meaningful unit&amp;quot; in word formation: in
our lexicon we only listed words and affixes. Along
with all simplex words and productive affixes, we
listed all the word formations that belong to closed
classes, i.e. words which are not formed according
to productive word formation processes. Thus, our
parser only has to analyse words formed according
to productive rules.
Secondly, MORPA performs, if available, some
tests on phonological and phonetic restrictions on the
recognition of morphemes in a specific context. The
ultimate effect of these tests is that incorrect recog-
nition of highly frequent and very small inflectional
suffixes, such as -e, -t, -d, -s, -r, -n, -en or -er, can
be prevented in many cases.
Finally, MORPA sees to it that words belonging
to minor lexical categories (such as determiners, pro-
nouns, conjunctions, etc.) are not recognised as word
parts. They never take part in morphological pro-

cesses. By rejecting these, we prevent the parser
from doing work which we know beforehand will be
in vain.
To illustrate the effect of the segmentation proce-
dure, its output for the noun beneveling (intoxica-
tion) is shown in (3)1:

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.98900916">
All of the parts in the segmentations under (3) are
Dutch morphemes listed in the morpheme lexicon.
Because the segmentation procedure analyses the in-
put word into all possible strings of morphemes with-
out any further grammatical knowledge, it generates
along with the one and only plausible segmentation
be + nevel + ing (3c), several alternative segmen-
tations. Many of these violate grammatical and/or
semantic restrictions.
In order to filter out ungrammatical segmenta-
tions, each segmentation is checked for its morpho-
syntactic well-formedness with the help of a cate-
gorial grammar. Consequently, every segmentation
that is not in accordance with the rules of Dutch
morphology is rejected by the parser. While check-
ing, the word class of the grammatical segmentations
is determined.
In accordance with the principles of Categorial
Grammar, our parser does not make use of a set of
explicitly represented word formation rules. Instead,
the morphological subcategorisation information is
encoded in the form of category assignments in the
lexicon. That is, prefixes have been assigned a cat-
egory of type AIB, which means that they take a
stem of category A on their right-hand side to yield
a word of category B2. For instance, the prefix be-
with category NIV requires a nominal stem to the
right to form a verb. Likewise, suffixes of category
A\B look for a stem of category A on their left-hand
side to yield a word of category B. Thus, the suffix
-ing, V\N, requires a verbal stem to the left to form
a noun. Free morphemes, such as nevel, are assigned
primitive categories, such as V or N3.
When segmenting, MORPA takes into account that
Dutch word stems, when inflected or used as the base of a
derivation, may undergo spelling changes. It would take
us too far to go into the spelling rules here, but in (3) the
effect of rules such as &apos;vowel gemination&apos; and `devoicing
of stem-final consonants&apos; shows up. See for more detail
[Heemskerk and van Heuven, 1993].
&apos;Note that in the literature on categorial grammar the
notational variant BIA is frequently used.
3Since our parser only accounts for morphological sub-
categorisation, the set of lexical categories does not equal
the set of syntactic categories. For example, all verbs are
In a strictly bottom-up fashion, the parser itera-
tively attempts to combine two adjacent elements,
reducing them in accordance with their categorial
specification with the help of three very general re-
duction laws:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.972134">
(4) prefixation: AlBâ¢AâkB
suffixation: A â¢ A\B B
compounding: Aâ¢B--4B
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994362638297873">
For pragmatic reasons, MORPA&apos;s rule for com-
pounding is not a categorial rule, but a categorial-like
rule: two adjacent stems AB may, according to the
Right-Hand Head Rule be combined into a word of
category B4. In addition to this general rule for com-
pounding, the grammar contains a small set of rules
defining productive compounding. An analysis fails
as soon as a string of categories cannot be reduced
to one single category.
The examples in (5) illustrate how iterative cat-
egorial reduction results in a successful parse. The
structures show the derivation and determination of
the output category of (3c). Also, the examples in (5)
illustrate that, while the categorial grammar filters
out many ungrammatical segmentations and derives
the word class of the input word, parsing introduces
a new type of ambiguity: one segmentation can be
assigned more than one structure. The ambiguity in
(5) is due to the fact that the morphemes be- (en-)
and nevel (mist) can belong to more than one lex-
ical category and as a consequence can be reduced
in more than one way. The ambiguity in (5a) and
(5b), is spurious in the sense that it does not corre-
late with a difference in pronunciation or word class
assignment. The reduction in (5c) results in an in-
correct word class assignment.
Because the word syntax as such is not restric-
tive enough, it was supplemented with a component
which heavily restrains the parser in building struc-
tures. This component, which is inspired by Lexical
Phonology, imposes an ordering on the attachment of
affixes and stems. Consequently, it restricts the type
or the complexity of the stem that an affix or other
stem may attach to. Rejection of structures can re-
sult in avoiding incorrect word class assignment and
rejection of incorrect segmentations.
In Lexical Phonology, the interaction between
stress behaviour and affix order is explained. [Chom-
sky and Halle, 1968] distinguished two classes of
suffixes with different stress properties, and [Siegel,
1979] observed that this distinction correlates with
the order in which the suffixes attach. Over the
years, theoretical linguists have become sceptical
assigned category V, irrespective of (in)transitivity. The
use of syntactic categories would complicate the grammar
considerably. See [Dowty, 1979] and [Moortgat, 1987] for
a discussion on this matter.

of these &amp;quot;level theories&amp;quot;, because of the so-called
&amp;quot;bracketing paradoxes&amp;quot;, i.e. constructions in which
two distinct constituent structures (for instance a
morphological and a phonological one) have to be
assigned to a word5. Despite the occurrence of brack-
eting paradoxes, however, the claims on level ordered
morphology following from these theories are highly
interesting: in checking the morphological claims
which follow from one of the theories that have been
developed for Dutch, [van Beurden, 1987], against
a large database containing approximately 123,000
Dutch words, relatively few counter-examples were
found.

Van Beurden claims that affix order does not de-
pend on stress properties, but on categorial proper-
ties. Thus, the major characteristic of this model
is that each attachment level is associated with a
specific lexical output category. The model seems
particularly suitable for use in MORPA, because it
is easy to integrate with our categorial parser. The
model implemented in MORPA, shown in (6), is an
extension of Van Beurden&apos;s model in a way which is
consistent with its basic assumptions6.
(6) Underived words, affixes
Unproductive word formations
V-morphology
A-morphology
N-morphology
On the basis of this model, the Dutch vocabulary can
be divided into four levels. Each of the levels in (6)
may be viewed as possible successive stages in word
formation. The first level, or lexical level, comprises
the lexicon of simplex words, affixes and irregular
formations. This level also contains all (borrowed)
Romance words. The elements of this lexical level
may be successively developed on the second level
on which V(erbal)-morphology takes place; the third
level on which A(djectival)-morphology takes place
and the fourth level on which N(ominal)-morphology
takes place. The name of the level indicates the re-
sulting word class. Each of these levels preserves
the possibility for suffixation, compounding and pre-
fixation. On the levels for V-morphology and A-
morphology each of these processes may take place
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.681435875">
6In van Beurden&apos;s model each categorial level has a
phonological level associated with it. As we are mainly
interested in the morphological aspects, we leave the
phonological claims for what they are: within SPRAAK-
MAKER, MORPA and MORPHON (the phonological
module) are autonomous modules, and as MORPA pre-
cedes MORPHON, any interaction between the two sys-
tems is one way.

only once. We assume that only the processes on the
N-morphology level are recursive, i.e. may take place
more than once (see [Heemskerk, 1989] for more de-
tails).
The model correctly predicts the derivation of the
word onverdraagzaamheid (intolerance). As shown
in (7), first verbal prefixation yields the verbal stem
verdraag (tolerate), then adjectival suffixation yields
the adjective verdraagzaam (tolerant), adjectival pre-
fixation yields the adjective onverdraagzaam (intoler-
ant) and, finally, nominal suffixation yields the noun
onverdraagzaamheid (intolerance):

Also, the level module rules out the analysis in (5c):
the nominal suffix -ing must not be attached before
the verbal prefix be-. Therefore the word cannot be

If we return to the example of beneveling we find
that of the six alternative segmentations in (3), only
four are accepted by the categorial component. As
is shown in (8) one of these segmentations has been
assigned a wrong word class. In (8) it is also shown
that, as a result of the level ordering, three of the as-
signed word classes (and matching structures&apos;) were
rejected. Consequently, two analyses remain.

Clearly, the ultimate handling of the remaining am-
biguity in (8) demands recourse to semantics and
world knowledge. For the large-scale domain we
are dealing with, however, we considered it unfea-
sible to implement semantic and pragmatic con-
straints. Thanks to the availability of a large anno-
tated corpus, the alternative of constructing a PCFG
came within reach. The corpus, being a represen-
tative sample of the past or existing vocabulary,
is expected to capture implicitly various semantic
and pragmatic constraints. [Fujisaki et al., 1989;
Liberman, 1991]. Empirical estimation of the proba-
bility of a parse tree on the basis of the corpus enables
us to order the competing analyses along a scale of
plausibility and select the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; parse out of the set
of alternatives.
A parse tree, such as (5a), is a series of applied pro-
duction rules8. In a context-free grammar it is as-
sumed that the application of a production rule is
independent of previously applied rules. In a PCFG,
each production rule r is assigned an estimated prob-
ability of use and the probability of the parse tree t
is the product of the constituting production rules
r1, r2,

<bodyText confidence="0.999980571428572">
The probability of each production rule in the gram-
mar has been estimated by means of straightforward
counting of appearances in the corpus, resulting in
relative frequencies. Let G be any non-terminal sym-
bol of the grammar; n(G) the number of productions
rewriting G and P(i1G) the probability that the ith
of these productions takes place, then

It is assumed that for all i = 1,2, ... , n(G) , POP)
is a positive number and that Ei P(i1G) = 1.
7In (8), I abstract from hierarchical structures, since
they are irrelevant for pronunciation. Relevant for pro-
nunciation are the morphemic segmentation and word
class assignment. Consequently, the structures of (5) are
represented as the segmentation be + nevel + ing, which
has been assigned two word classes N and V.

of a parse tree and discuss production rules of the type

Thus, this simple PCFG provides general informa-
tion on how likely a parse tree is going to appear.
It is well-known that the accuracy of the empirical
estimate of a probability function depends heavily on
the appropriateness of the training set: for one thing,
it must have a reasonable size and be representative
of the domain that is being modelled. Our training
set was the CELEX database which contains approx-
imately 123,000 Dutch stems provided with syntactic
information, a morphological decomposition and to-
ken frequency information [van der Wouden, 1988;
Burnage, 1990]. The token frequency information
is based on a 44-million-word corpus. We collected
from this database both type and token frequencies:
type frequencies indicate how often a production rule
occurs in the Dutch vocabulary (i.e. in the 123,000
stems corpus); token frequencies indicate how often
a production rule occurs in Dutch texts (i.e. in the
44-million-word corpus). The underlying idea was
that for tests on dictionary samples the empirical es-
timate must be based on type frequencies, whereas
for tests on text samples it must be based on token
frequencies.
Given the information in the database, we ex-
pected the collection of frequency data to be a matter
of straightforward counting: CELEX&apos;s morphologi-
cal decomposition consists of hierarchical structures
which are comparable to MORPA&apos;s structures (cf.
9Although not in the grammar, this symbol is used
to make it possible to describe the possibility of a word
being of a certain category in terms of (5).
&apos;For the reader&apos;s convenience, the probabilities denote
the tree (in labelled bracketing) and production rules
involved.
the examples in (5)), the syntactic information con-
sists of the word class, and because each stem in
the stem corpus is provided with a token frequency,
type and token frequencies could be collected simul-
taneously: every time a production rule was encoun-
tered in the stems corpus, 1 was added to its type
frequency, and the token frequency of the word in
which the rule was attested was added to its token
frequency.
Unfortunately, however, straightforward counting
of all production rules contained in CELEX did not
suffice to provide MORPA with the relevant informa-
tion: it turned out that the set of production rules
employed by MORPA was not contained in the set of
production rules given by CELEX. For a very large
part, the mismatch between the rules is caused by
the fact that CELEX and MORPA yield different
analyses. For example, because in MORPA all words
formed according to unproductive rules are entirely
listed in the lexicon, and the Dutch adjectival suffix -
elijk `-ly&apos; is considered to be unproductive, all words
derived by this suffix are listed. In CELEX, how-
ever, these words are decomposed. Now, in order to
analyse the word vriendelijk (friendly), MORPA will
employ the production rule (13a), whereas CELEX
employed the rules in (13b):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.775293">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.953005064516129">
A N N\A
N âr vriend
N\A --4 elijk
Consequently, straightforward counting of the pro-
duction rules in CELEX, would result in overesti-
mating the probability of the productions &amp;quot;A ââ 
N N\A&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;N vriend&amp;quot;, and lack of frequency
information for the production &amp;quot;A vriendelijk&amp;quot;.
Amongst the MORPA rules which were not con-
tained in the set of CELEX rules, there were also
all the rules introducing inflectional affixes and in-
flected stems. Of course, this is due to the fact that
the 123,000-entry corpus only contains stems. As
CELEX stems are considered to be an abstract way
of representing a whole inflectional paradigm, inflec-
tional affixes and inflected stems were not included
in the database, and the token frequency associated
with a stem is the sum of the token frequencies of the
stem and all its inflected forms. However, MORPA
also contains inflectional rules of which the token
frequencies should be available. For obtaining fre-
quency information on inflectional affixes and stems,
we had to use the CELEX corpus, containing ap-
proximately 44 million words. Unfortunately, the
morphological information in this corpus does not
contain any production rules or information on the
affixes.
Thus, after all production rules in CELEX had
been counted straightforwardly, we were only able
to assign frequency information to a part of the
MORPA rules. Moreover, we knew that some of
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.998186481481481">
these frequencies were overestimated. Because we
expected these facts to have a negative influence on
the accuracy of the PCFG, we decided to put some
effort in making the empirical estimate more reli-
able. We had to be very creative in finding other
ways to provide the rules which are not in CELEX
with frequency information (from CELEX), but we
finally managed to provide almost all production
rules employed by MORPA with frequency informa-
tion. Also, we put some effort into &amp;quot;repairing&amp;quot; the
overestimated frequencies. Consequently, the data
have become more complete and more reliable, but
as a result of these problems, the collection of fre-
quency information became a time-consuming and
error-sensitive job: a lot of work had to be done by
hand. Therefore, it is practically almost undoable to
go over it all over again.
With respect to the reliability of the frequency
data, it turned out that the token frequencies are
less reliable than the lexical frequencies. Most impor-
tantly, this was due to the fact that in CELEX, the
token frequencies were &amp;quot;string&amp;quot; counts, i.e. they in-
dicate how many times each separate string of letters
occurs in the 44-million-word corpus. Because some
of these &amp;quot;separate strings of letters&amp;quot; may be ambigu-
ous in word class, morphemic segmentation or mean-
ing, they are assigned different entries in the stems
corpus. Ideally, the token frequencies in the corpus
are disambiguated for the different entries, but at
the time we collected our data they were not&amp;quot;. As
a consequence, numerous stems were assigned over-
estimated token frequencies.
Consider, for example, the string met, which can
be linked to two entries in the stems database: the
entry of the preposition met &apos;with&apos;, and the entry
of the noun met &apos;minced pork&apos;. Since the individ-
ual frequencies of each of these entries have not been
sorted out, the rules &amp;quot;P â+ met&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;N -4 met&amp;quot;
have the same frequency, i.e. the frequency of the
string met. Because the preposition is highly fre-
quent and the noun hardly ever occurs, the latter
rule has been assigned a frequency which is highly
overestimated. Since in addition to that overesti-
mation the rule &amp;quot;w N&amp;quot; is more frequent than
the rule &amp;quot;w P&amp;quot;, and to the frequency of the rule
&amp;quot;N met&amp;quot; is added the frequency of the two com-
pounds in which it takes part, MORPA will consider
the noun to be the most likely analysis. Had the fre-
quencies been sorted out, this would not be the case:
the high probability of the rule &amp;quot;P -4 met&amp;quot; would
have overweighted all other probabilities.
The unreliability of token frequencies was beared
out by some preliminary tests, in which we exper-
imented using type and token frequencies on both
dictionary and text test samples. When examining
&amp;quot;By now, CELEX has disambiguated the token fre-
quencies, but as the collection of reliable data was very
time-consuming, we have not yet &amp;quot;repaired&amp;quot; our token
frequencies.
MORPA&apos;s output on a text test sample (for which to-
ken frequencies were used), we discovered that many
of the erroneous selections were indeed attributable
to the lack of disambiguation of token frequencies.
Especially if the sample contained highly frequent
string ambiguous simplex words, such as met, which
do not take part in derivation or compounding,
MORPA&apos;s performance got worse. It turned out that
MORPA&apos;s performance was best, when type frequen-
cies were used in a dictionary test sample.
MORPA first generates all possible parses and the
associated probabilities, ordering them along a scale
of plausibility afterwards. Thus, as yet, it is not a
probabilistic parser in the sense that it prunes the
low probability parses in an early stage [Fujisaki et
al., 1989; Jelinek el al., 1990]. Adjusting the parser
will speed it up considerably, but also pruning low-
ranked analyses may lead to incompleteness.
In conclusion, let us return to the example word
beneveling. After likelihood determination and or-
dering of the two remaining analyses in (8), the cor-
rect analysis be + nevel + ing is in topmost position:

4 The performance of MORPA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825181818182">
In order to evaluate the performance of our system
a test was run on a dictionary test sample of 3,077
words. The words contained in this sample were ran-
domly taken from texts of the so-called &amp;quot;Bloemendal
corpus&amp;quot; [Bringmann, 19901.
For a correct interpretation of the results, it is nec-
essary to know that a word was considered to be
correctly analysed, if it had been assigned the cor-
rect morphemic segmentation and word class. The
analysis in (15) is the correct analysis of the word
be n eveling:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.77749">
(15) [N [prefix be] [seem nevel] [suffix ing]]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99961">
Thus, in the final output of MORPA, morphological
information which is irrelevant for pronunciation is
eliminated: analyses which have the same segmenta-
tion, but are ambiguous in their hierarchical struc-
ture and/or categorial labelling of the morphemes,
such as (5a) and (5b), become one as long as the
morphemes have the same morphological classifica-
tion, e.g. ((non)-native) prefix, suffix or stem, and
the word is assigned the same word class.
As MORPA combines a conventional grammar with
a probability-based scoring function, it is interest-
ing to look at the effects of both the rule-based part
and the probability-based ordering technique in their
own right: the segmentation procedure and grammar
determine the quality of the analyses and the num-
ber of analyses generated, and the probability-based
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996215753246754">
scoring function enables MORPA to select the most
likely analysis from a set of alternatives.
The results in (16) show how well the segmenta-
tion procedure and grammar succeeded in deriving
the correct analysis for the test words:
words assigned Number %
n = 3,077
a correct analysis 2,968 96
no correct analysis 32 1
no analysis at all 77 3
MORPA assigned no analysis at all to 3% of the test
words. For 1% of the test words, one or more anal-
yses were generated, but the set of alternatives did
not contain a correct analysis. In these cases, the
word either contains an unknown morpheme, or the
grammar is too restrictive. 96% of the test words
were assigned a correct analysis.
Given the problem of ambiguity, the number of
analyses generated for one word is remarkably small:
considering only the words which were correctly anal-
ysed, MORPA assigned a single, correct analysis to
46% of the test words. For 54%, the correct analysis
was among alternatives:
words assigned a correct Number %
analysis, which is n = 2,968
among alternatives 1,612 54
unique 1,356 46
Although we did not keep track of the number of
segmentations assigned to the input words, it can
be generally assumed that the number of alternative
segmentations is very much reduced by the gram-
mar. Also, through converting output that contains
hierarchical structures and categorial labels (cf. (5)a
and (5)b) to linear structures and morpheme classi-
fication (cf (15)), a lot of unnecessary ambiguity is
eliminated.
In order to evaluate the probability-based scoring
function, which enables MORPA to order compet-
ing analyses along a scale of plausibility, it must be
established how often MORPA succeeds in select-
ing the correct analysis from a set of alternatives.
MORPA was able to select the correct analysis as
most likely member of a set of alternatives for 92%
of the test words. For a proper judgement of this
performance, the percentage must be compared with
the chances of selecting the most likely analysis from
the set of alternatives. This chance is determined at
40%:
words assigned the best Number %
analysis from a set of n = 1,612
alternatives, by
the probability-based 1,483 92
ordering technique
chance 645 40
It is not easy to tell which factors attributed to the
fact that for 8% of the words the correct analysis was
not selected as best analysis. The frequency data
may be unreliable or the probability function may
not be appropriate. Also, the correct analysis does
not always have to be the most probable one.
Most importantly however, is the overall perfor-
mance of MORPA&apos;s PCFG on the Bloemendal cor-
pus: 92% of the test words had been assigned a cor-
rect analysis which was also the first analysis yielded.
words assigned Number %
n = 3,077
a correct analysis in 2,835 92
topmost position
For the 8% of the test words which were not assigned
a correct analysis in first position, MORPA either
generated a correct analysis which was not in first
position, or no correct analysis or no analysis at all.
In order to establish the relevance for word level pro-
nunciation, a test was run on a test file containing
approximately 2000 isolated words. The test words
were selected from different corpora to make sure the
file contained both newspaper text, dictionary words
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990544">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999904">
and words of frequency 112. The words of the test file
were analysed by MORPA and the topmost analyses
were used by MORPHON to derive a pronunciation
transcription. A transcription was considered correct
if it had the proper phonemic transcription, which
means that all appropriate non-optional phonologi-
cal rules must have been applied, and that the words
must have the correct syllable structure and stress
pattern.
Fifteen percent of the words were assigned an er-
roneous phonemic transcription&apos;. Twenty percent
of the errors could be traced back to the phonolog-
ical module, the remaining errors, 80%, are due to
faulty morphological analyses. Of the errors made
by MORPA, 88% led to an incorrect pronunciation
representation. As expected, segmentation errors al-
most always led to an incorrect phonemic transcrip-
tion. Category assignment errors also cause incorrect
pronunciations, though less often. This bears out the
importance of the category a word belongs to.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96090625">
As the results show, this fully implemented system,
running with a morpheme lexicon of 17,087 entries
on a randomly selected 3,077 words test sample, is
successful. This success may to a large extent be
put down to the augmentation of the context-free
grammar to a PCFG14.
As mentioned above, the accuracy of a PCFG de-
pends heavily on the accuracy of the empirical es-
timate of the probability function. We were lucky
to have at our disposal a training set which was
both large enough and representative, but due to the
facts that, in some cases, MORPA and the training
set yield different analyses, and token frequencies for
string ambiguous words were not disambiguated, we
expect our estimate to have become less reliable. In
order to improve MORPA&apos;s performance on text test
samples, we will have to &amp;quot;repair&amp;quot; the token frequen-
cies.
It is often argued that a PCFG only provides poor
estimates of probability, and that probabilistic gram-
mars require more sensitivity to lexical context. Af-
ter all, PCFGs only provide very general information
on how likely a production rule is going to appear
anywhere in a sample of the language, and produc-
tion rules are not always context-free [Magerman and
12For reasons I will not go into here, the newspaper
and dictionary words did not comprise highly frequent
words [Nunn and van Heuven, 1993].
13See for a comparison with a data-oriented system
for Dutch grapheme-to-phoneme transcription [van den
Bosch and Daelemans, 1993]. Note that in this compar-
ison syllabification and stress assignment have not been
taken into account.
14Before this augmentation, the parser was enriched
with some preliminary criteria imposing an order on the
set of alternatives. Then, the performance came up to
85%.
Marcus, 1991; Resnik, 1992]. However, most of the
work done on context-free probabilistic grammars is
done for syntax, and as I hope to have shown that a
PCFG yields good results for morphology, it might
be interesting to find out if, for one reason or another,
PCFGs are more successful for morphology than for
syntax.

In order to deal with ambiguity, the MORphological PArser MORPA is provided with a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG), i.e. it combines a &amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot; context-free morphological grammar to filter out ungrammatical segmentations with a probability-based scoring function which determines the likelihood of each successful parse. Consequently, remaining analyses can be ordered along a scale of plausibility. Test performance data will show that a PCFG yields good results in morphological parsing.
