Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999947">
Hedge cues were detected using a super-
vised Conditional Random Field (CRF)
classifier exploiting features from the
RASP parser. The CRF’s predictions were
filtered using known cues and unseen in-
stances were removed, increasing preci-
sion while retaining recall. Rules for scope
detection, based on the grammatical re-
lations of the sentence and the part-of-
speech tag of the cue, were manually-
developed. However, another supervised
CRF classifier was used to refine these pre-
dictions. As a final step, scopes were con-
structed from the classifier output using a
small set of post-processing rules. Devel-
opment of the system revealed a number of
issues with the annotation scheme adopted
by the organisers.

<bodyText confidence="0.999727157894737">
Speculative or, more generally, “hedged” language
is a way of weakening the strength of a statement.
It is usually signalled by a word or phrase, called a
hedge cue, which weakens some clauses or propo-
sitions. These weakened portions of a sentence
form the scope of the hedge cues.
Hedging is an important tool in scientific lan-
guage allowing scientists to guide research be-
yond the evidence without overstating what fol-
lows from their work. Vincze et al. (2008) show
that 19.44% of all sentences in the full papers
of the BioScope corpus contain hedge cues. De-
tecting these cues is potentially valuable for tasks
such as scientific information extraction or liter-
ature curation, as typically only definite informa-
tion should be extracted and curated. Most work
so far has been done on classifying entire text
sentences as hedged or not, but this risks los-
ing valuable information in (semi-)automated sys-

tems. More recent approaches attempt to find the
specific parts of a text sentence that are hedged.
Here we describe a system that is designed to
find hedge cues and their scopes in biomedical re-
search papers. It works in three stages:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94423675">
1. Detecting the cues using a token-level super-
vised classifier.
2. Finding the scopes with a combination of
manual rules and a second supervised token-
level classifier.
3. Applying postprocessing rules to convert the
token-level annotation into predictions about
scope.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998052285714286">
Parts of the system are similar to that of Morante
and Daelemans (2009) — both make use of ma-
chine learning to tag tokens as being in a cue or
a scope. The most important differences are the
use of manually defined rules and the inclusion of
grammatical relations from a parser as critical fea-
tures.

A revised version of the BioScope corpus (Vincze
et al., 2008), containing annotation of cues and
scopes, was provided as training data for the
CoNLL-2010 shared task (Farkas et al., 2010).
This includes 9 full papers and 1273 abstracts
from biomedical research fields. A separate new
set of full papers was released for evaluation as
part of the task. Table 1 contains an overview of
the training corpus statistics.

There are a number of conditions on the anno-

</bodyText>

For development of the system, before the eval-
uation data were released, we used 60% of the
available corpus for training and 40% for testing.
The results we give below measure the system per-
formance on the evaluation data while using all
of the training data to build the supervised clas-
sifiers. The manually-developed rules are based
on the 60% of the development data we originally
reserved for training.
All of the training and test data sentences
were tokenised and parsed using the RASP sys-
tem (Briscoe et al., 2006). Multiple part-of-
speech (POS) tag outputs were passed to the parser
(to compensate for the high number of unseen
words in biomedical text), retaining just the high-
est ranked directed graph of grammatical relations
(GRs). Each node in the graph represents a word
token annotated with POS, lemma, and positional
order information. In the case of parse failure the
set of unconnected graphs returned by the highest-
ranked spanning subanalyses for each sentence
were retained.

3 Speculation cues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999464076923077">
The hedge cues are found using a Conditional
Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) classi-
fier, implemented using CRF++ 1. We chose the
CRF model because we framed the task as one
of token-level sequential tagging and CRFs are
known to achieve state-of-the-art performance on
related text classification tasks. Each word token
is assigned one of the following tags: F (first word
of a cue), I (inside a cue), L (last word of a cue),
O (outside, not a cue), hereafter referred to as the
FILO scheme.
The feature types used for classification are de-
fined in terms of the grammatical relations output
provided by the RASP system. We use binary fea-
tures that indicate whether a word token is a head
or a dependent in specific types of grammatical
relation (GR). This distinguishes between differ-
ent functions of the same word (when used as a
subject, object, modifier, etc.). These features are
combined with POS and lemma of the word to dis-
tinguish between uses of different cues and cue
types. We also utilise features for the lemma and
POS of the 3 words before and after the current
word.
The list of feature types for training the classi-
fier is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999734">
• string
• lemma
• part-of-speech
• broad part-of-speech
• incoming GRs + POS
• outgoing GRs + POS
• incoming GRs + POS + lemma
• outgoing GRs + POS + lemma
• lemma + POS + POS of next word
• lemma + POS + POS of previous word
• 3 previous lemma + POS combinations
• 3 following lemma + POS combinations.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999036375">
Outgoing GRs are grammatical relations where
the current word is the head, incoming GRs where
it is the dependent.
The predictions from the classifier are com-
pared to the list of known cues extracted from the
training data; the longest possible match is marked
as a cue. For example, the classifier could output
the following tag sequence:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.964731333333333">

Experiments in section 5.1 show that our sys-

Lemma is the most important feature type for cue
detection and when it is not available, there is not
enough evidence to make good predictions. There-
fore, we compare all system predictions to the list
of known cues and if there is no match, they are
removed. The detection of unseen hedge cues is a
potential topic for future research.

<bodyText confidence="0.995139666666667">
We find a scope for each cue predicted in the pre-
vious step. Each word token in the sentence is
tagged with either F (first word of a scope), I (in-
side a scope), L (last word of a scope) or O (out-
side, not in a scope). Using our example sentence
(2) the correct tagging is:

If a cue contains multiple words, they are each
processed separately and the predictions are later
combined by postprocessing rules.
As the first step, manually written rules are ap-
plied that find the scope based on GRs and POS
tags. We refine these predictions using a second
CRF classifier and further feature types extracted
from the RASP system output. Finally, postpro-
cessing rules are applied to convert the tagging se-
quence into scopes. By default, the minimal scope
returned is the cue itself.

in the text centered on the current node.

the traversal of the graph is terminated when

method to deal with this problem, but they also
admitted that it (&lt;would&gt; fail to identify highly
unusual tRNAs).
Following the rules, would is identified as a cue
word with the part-of-speech VM; this triggers the
first rule in the list. The parent of would is fail
since they are connected with a GR where fail is
the head. Everything that is below fail in the GR
graph and positioned after would is marked as be-
ing in the scope. Since fail is not passive, the sub-
ject it is left out. The final scope returned by the
rule is then would fail to identify highly unusual

<bodyText confidence="0.9992245">
The scope of the hedge cue can often be found
by tracking the sequence of grammatical relations
in the GR graph of a sentence, as described by
the manual rules. To allow the classifier to learn
such regularities, we introduce the concept of a
GR path.
Given that the sentence has a full parse and con-
nected graph, we can find the shortest connected
path between any two words. We take the con-
nected path between the word and the cue and con-
vert it into a string representation to use it as a fea-
ture value in the classifier. Path sections of differ-
ent lengths allow the system to find both general
and more specific patterns. POS tags are used as
node values to abstract away from word tokens.
An example for the word unusual, using the
graph from Figure 1, is given below. Five fea-
tures representing paths with increasing lengths
plus one feature containing the full path are ex-
tracted.

4.3 Post-processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851571428571">
If the cue contains multiple words, the tag se-
quences have to be combined. This is done by
overlapping the sequences and choosing the pre-
ferred tag for each word, according to the hierar-
chy F &gt; L &gt; I &gt; O.
Next, scopes are constructed from tag se-
quences using the following rules:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992899285714286">
• Scope start point is the first token tagged as
F before the cue. If none are found, the first
word of the cue is used as the start point.
• Scope end point is the last token tagged as L
after the cue. If none are found, look for tags
I and F. If none are found, the last word of the
cue is used as end point.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984698">
The scopes are further modified until none of
the rules below return any updates:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.845167142857143">
• If the last token of the scope is punctuation,
move the endpoint before the token.
• If the last token is a closing bracket, move the
scope endpoint before the opening bracket.
• If the last token is a number and it is not pre-
ceded by a capitalised word (e.g. Table 16),
move the scope endpoint before the token.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.922501944444444">
This is a heuristic rule to handle trailing ci-
tations which are frequent in the training data
and often misattached by the parser.
Finally, scopes are checked for partial overlap
and any instances are corrected. For example, the
system might return a faulty version (7) of the sen-
tence (2) in which one scope is only partially con-
tained within the other.
(7) We [&lt;expect&gt; that this cluster (&lt;may&gt; represent a
novel] selenoprotein family).
This prediction cannot be represented within the
format specified for the shared task and we were
unable to find cases where such annotation would
be needed. These scopes are modified by moving
the end of the first scope to the end of the second
scope. The example above would become:

The results below are obtained using the scorers
implemented by the organisers of the shared task.
As our baseline system, we use simple string
matching. The list of known cues is collected from
the training data and compared to the evaluation
sentences. The longest possible match is always
marked as a cue. ML1 to ML3 are variations of
the system described in section 3. All available
data, from papers and abstracts, were used to train
the CRF classifier. ML1 uses the results of the
classifier directly. The longest sequence of tokens
tagged as being part of a cue is used to form the fi-
nal prediction. ML2 incorporates the list of known
cues, constructing a cue over the longest sequence
of matching tokens where at least one token has
been tagged as belonging to a cue. ML3 uses the
list of known cues and also removes any predicted
cues not seen in the training data.

The baseline system returns nearly all cues but
since it matches every string, it also returns many
false positives, resulting in low precision. ML1
delivers more realistic predictions and increases
precision to 0.79. This illustrates how the use of a
word as a hedge cue depends on its context and not
only on the word itself. ML2 incorporates known
cues and increases both precision and recall. ML3
removes any unseen cue predictions further im-
proving precision. This shows the system is un-
able to accurately predict cues that have not been
included in the training data.

cues and the other with cues predicted by the ML3
system from section 4.
The baseline system looks at each cue and
marks a scope from the beginning of the cue to the
end of the sentence, excluding the full stop. The
system using manual rules applies a rule for each
cue to find its scope, as described in section 4.1.
The POS tag of the cue is used to decide which
rule should be used and the GRs determine the
scope.
The final system uses the result from the manual
rules to derive features, adds various further fea-
tures from the parser and trains a CRF classifier to
refine the predictions.
We hypothesized that the speculative sentences
in abstracts may differ from the ones in full papers
and a 10-fold cross-validation of the development
data supported this intuition. Therefore, the orig-
inal system (CRF1) only used data from the full
papers to train the scope detection classifier. We
present here also the system trained on all of the
available data (CRF2).
Post-processing rules are applied equally to all
of these systems.
The baseline system performs remarkably well.

It does not use any grammatical or lexical know-
ledge apart from the cue and yet it delivers an F-
score of 0.50 with predicted and 0.57 with gold
standard cues.
Manual rules are essentially a more fine-grained
version of the baseline. Instead of a single rule,
one of 8 possible rules is selected based on the
POS tag of the cue. This improves the results,
increasing the F-score to 0.53 with predicted and
0.64 with gold standard cues. The improvement
suggests that the POS tag of a cue is a good indi-
cator of how it behaves in the sentence.
Error analysis showed that 35% of faulty scopes
were due to incorrect or unconnected GR graphs
output by the parser, and 65% due to exceptions
that the rules do not cover. An example of an ex-
ception, the braces { } showing the scopes pre-
dicted by the rules, is given in (9).

is {(&lt;likely&gt; lower than the contamination rate of the

as discussed in 47 is a modifier of the clause
which is usually included in the scope but in this
case should be left out.
Finally, the last system combines features from
the rule-based system with features from RASP to
train a second classifier and improves our results
further, reaching 0.56 with predicted cues.
Inclusion of the abstracts as training data gave
a small improvement with predicted cues but not
with gold standard cues. It is part of future work
to determine if and how the use of hedges differs
across text sources.

During analysis of the data, several examples were
found that could not be correctly annotated due to
the restrictions of the markup. This leads us to
believe that the current rules for annotation might
not be best suited to handle complex constructions
containing hedged text.
Most importantly, the requirement for the hedge
scope to be continuous over the surface form of
text sentence does not work for some examples
drawn from the development data. In (10) below
it is uncertain whether fat body disintegration is
independent of the AdoR. In contrast, it is stated
with certainty that fat body disintegration is pro-
moted by action of the hemocytes, yet the latter
assertion is included in the scope to keep it contin-
uous.
(10) (The block of pupariation &lt;appears&gt; to involve
signaling through the adenosine receptor ( AdoR )) ,
but (fat body disintegration, which is promoted by
action of the hemocytes , &lt;seems&gt; to be independent
of the AdoR) .
Similarly, according to the guidelines, the sub-
ject of be likely should be included in its scope,
as shown in example (11). In sentence (12), how-
ever, the subject this phenomenon is separated by
two non-speculative clauses and is therefore left
out of the scope.
(11) Some predictors make use of the observation that
(neighboring genes whose relative location is
conserved across several prokaryotic organisms are
&lt;likely&gt; to interact).
(12) This phenomenon, which is independent of tumour
necrosis factor, is associated with HIV replication, and
(is thus &lt;likely&gt; to explain at least in part the
perpetuation of HIV infection in monocytes).
In (13), arguably, there is no hedging as the sen-
tence precisely describes a statistical technique for
predicting interaction given an assumption.

Most of the previous work has been done on classi-
fying sentences as hedged or not, rather than find-
ing the scope of the hedge.
The first linguistically and computationally mo-
tivated study of hedging in biomedical texts is
Light et al. (2004). They present an analysis of the
problem based on Medline abstracts and construct
an initial experiment for automated classification.
Medlock and Briscoe (2007) propose a weakly
supervised machine learning approach to the
hedge classification problem. They construct a
classifier with single words as features and use
a small amount of seed data to bootstrap the
system, achieving the precision/recall break-even
point (BEP) of 0.76. Szarvas (2008) extends this
work by introducing bigrams and trigrams as fea-
ture types, improving feature selection and us-
ing external data sources to construct lists of cue
words, achieving a BEP of 0.85.
Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) apply a combina-
tion of lexical and syntactic methods, improving
on previous results and showing that quantifying
the strength of a hedge can be beneficial for clas-
sification of speculative sentences.
Vincze et al. (2008) created a publicly available
annotated corpus of biomedical papers, abstracts
and clinical data called BioScope, parts of which
were also used as training data for the CoNLL10
shared task, building on the dataset and annota-
tion scheme used for evaluation by Medlock and
Briscoe (2007).
Morante and Daelemans (2009) use the Bio-
Scope corpus to approach the problem of identify-
ing cues and scopes via supervised machine learn-
ing. They train a selection of classifiers to tag each
word and combine the results with a final classi-
fier, finding 65.6% of the scopes in abstracts and
35.9% of the scopes in papers.

8 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995631578947">
We have shown that the GRs output by the RASP
system can be effectively used as features for de-
tecting cues in a supervised classifier and also as
the basis for manual rules and features for scope
detection. We demonstrated that a small num-
ber of manual rules can provide competitive re-
sults, but that these can be further improved using
machine learning techniques and post-processing
rules. The generally low ceiling for the scope de-
tection results demonstrates the difficulty of both
annotating and detecting the hedge scopes in terms
of surface sentential forms.
Future work could usefully be directed at im-
proving performance on unseen cue detection and
on learning rules of the same form as those de-
veloped manually from annotated training data.
However, perhaps the most pressing issue is that of
establishing the best possible annotation and con-
sequent definition of the scope detection task.

More recent approaches attempt to find the specific parts of a text sentence that are hedged. Here we describe a system that is designed to find hedge cues and their scopes in biomedical research papers. It works in three stages: 1. Detecting the cues using a token-level supervised classifier. 2. Finding the scopes with a combination of manual rules and a second supervised tokenlevel classifier. 3. Applying postprocessing rules to convert the token-level annotation into predictions about scope. Parts of the system are similar to that of Morante and Daelemans (2009) — both make use of machine learning to tag tokens as being in a cue or a scope. The most important differences are the use of manually defined rules and the inclusion of grammatical relations from a parser as critical features. 2 Data A revised version of the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008), containing annotation of cues and scopes, was provided as training data for the CoNLL-2010 shared task (Farkas et al., 2010). This includes 9 full papers and 1273 abstracts from biomedical research fields. A separate new set of full papers was released for evaluation as part of the task. Table 1 con</context>

Five features representing paths with increasing lengths plus one feature containing the full path are extracted.

On line 2, this node is connected to fail (VV0) by an auxiliary GR type. More links are added until we reach unusual (JJ). The presence of potential clause ending words, used by Morante and Daelemans (2009), is included as a feature type with values: whereas, but, although, nevertheless, notwithstanding, however, consequently, hence, therefore, thus, instead, otherwise, alternatively, furthermore, moreover, since. 4.3 Post-processing If the cue contains multiple words, the tag sequences have to be combined. This is done by overlapping the sequences and choosing the preferred tag for each word, according to the hierarchy F &gt; L &gt; I &gt; O. Next, scopes are constructed from tag sequences using the following rules: • Scope start point is the first token tagged as F before the cue. If none are found, th</context>

Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) apply a combination of lexical and syntactic methods, improving on previous results and showing that quantifying the strength of a hedge can be beneficial for classification of speculative sentences. Vincze et al. (2008) created a publicly available annotated corpus of biomedical papers, abstracts and clinical data called BioScope, parts of which were also used as training data</context>
