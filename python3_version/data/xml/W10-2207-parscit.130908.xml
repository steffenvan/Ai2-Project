Abstract

This paper develops computational tools for
evaluating competing syllabic parses of a pho-
nological string on the basis of temporal pat-
terns in speech production data. This is done
by constructing models linking syllable parses
to patterns of coordination between articulato-
ry events. Data simulated from different syl-
labic parses are evaluated against experimental
data from American English and Moroccan
Arabic, two languages claimed to parse similar
strings of segments into different syllabic
structures. Results implicate a tautosyllabic
parse of initial consonant clusters in English
and a heterosyllabic parse of initial clusters in
Arabic, in accordance with theoretical work on
the syllable structure of these languages. It is
further demonstrated that the model can cor-
rectly diagnose syllable structure even when
previously proposed phonetic heuristics for
such structure do not clearly point to the cor-
rect diagnosis.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.992695543478261">
Languages are claimed to differ in how word-
initial consonant clusters are parsed into higher
level phonological structures. For example, Eng-
lish (Kahn, 1976) and Georgian (Vogt, 1971) are
claimed to parse initial clusters into complex syl-
lable onsets. In contrast, Berber and Moroccan
Arabic are claimed to parse initial clusters hete-
rosyllabically, [#C.CV-], because the syllable
structure of these languages allows at most one
consonant (simplex onset) per syllable onset
(Dell &amp; Elmedlaoui, 2002).
Of direct relevance to these claims are patterns
of temporal stability in the production of initial
clusters. In those cases where speech production
data are available, languages that allow complex
onsets exhibit patterns of temporal stability that
differ from languages that allow only syllables
with simplex syllable onsets.
These observed temporal differences have
been quantified in terms of the relative stability
of intervals as calculated across words beginning
with one, two and three initial consonants
(Browman &amp; Goldstein, 1988; Byrd, 1995;
Honorof &amp; Browman, 1995; Shaw, Gafos,
Hoole, &amp; Zeroual, 2009). Figure 1 schematizes
temporal differences between simplex and com-
plex onsets. The figure shows three temporal in-
tervals left-delimited by landmarks in the conso-
nant cluster, the left edge of the cluster, the cen-
ter of the cluster and the right edge of the cluster,
and right-delimited by a common anchor point.

tervals, left edge to anchor, center to anchor and
right edge to anchor, delineated by points in an
initial single consonant or consonant cluster and
a common anchor (A). The alignment schema on
the left/right represents experimentally observed
temporal manifestations of the simplex/complex
onset parse. Such patterns have been used as
phonetic heuristics in diagnosing syllable struc-
ture in experimental data.
When clusters are parsed into simplex syllable
onsets (Figure 1: left), the duration of the right
edge to anchor interval is unperturbed by the ad-
dition of consonants to the word. Consequently,
this interval remains stable across #CVX and

#CCVX words. In contrast, when clusters are
parsed into a complex onset (Figure 1: right), the
duration of the right edge to anchor interval
shrinks to make room for the addition of a con-
sonant to the syllable. Under this temporal
alignment schema, the center to anchor interval
remains more stable across #CVX and #CCVX
words than both the right edge to anchor interval
and the left edge to anchor interval.
Experimental results showing temporal pat-
terns consistent with the schema on the right side
of Figure 1 include Browman and Goldstein
(1988), Honorof and Browman (1995), and Ma-
rin and Pouplier (2008) on American English,
Goldstein, Chitoran, &amp; Selkirk (2007) on Geor-
gian and Hermes, Grice, Muecke and Niemann
(2008) on Italian. Results showing the temporal
pattern on the left side of Figure 1 include
Goldstein et al. (2007) on Berber, Shaw et al.
(2009) on Moroccan Arabic and Hermes et al.
(2008) on Italian.
We briefly review representative quantitative
results illustrating the different temporal organi-
zations in Figure 1. For a language with complex
onsets, Browman and Goldstein (1988) show that
the standard deviation calculated across English
word sets such as pot—sot—spot—lot—plot—splot is
smaller for the center to anchor interval, 15.8 ms,
than for the left edge to anchor interval, 37.7 ms,
and the right edge to anchor interval, 33.6 ms. In
contrast, for a simplex onset language, Shaw et
al. (2009) show that across similar Moroccan
Arabic word sets, e.g., bati—sbati, the right edge
to anchor interval has a lower standard deviation,
14 ms, than the center to anchor interval, 27 ms,
and the left edge to anchor interval, 77 ms.
Although the experimental work reviewed
above shows that stability comparisons among
the right edge to anchor, center to anchor and left
edge to anchor intervals can provide good heuris-
tics for testing syllabification hypotheses in ex-
perimental data, such heuristics stated in terms of
inequalities are known to break down under
some conditions. For example, simulations with
a model reported in Shaw et al. (2009) demon-
strated that when the overall variability in the
intervals is high, the simplex onset parse can
generate intervals exhibiting stability reversals
whereby the center to anchor interval is more
stable than the right/left edge to anchor interval
(contra the heuristic which states that the right
edge to anchor interval should be the most stable;
again, see Figure 1: left). This result indicates the
frailty of phonetic heuristics in the form of in-
equalities, e.g. a simplex onset parse implies that
the right edge to anchor interval is more stable
than the center to anchor interval and the left
edge to anchor interval. Such heuristics may be
too coarse or even in some cases misleading in
distinguishing competing syllabic parses using
experimental data.
This paper advances a quantitative method for
evaluating competing syllable parses that aims to
improve on previously proposed phonetic heuris-
tics and, by doing so, sharpen the interpretation
of temporal stability patterns in terms of syllabic
structure. In mediating between phonological
theory and experimental data, the computational
model makes it possible to discover syllabifica-
tion rules from phonetic patterns. The model
provides a new understanding of languages with
known syllable structure and the analytical tools
to deduce syllabification rules in less-studied
languages.

The general plan is to simulate data from models
encoding competing syllabic parses, to quantify
in the simulated data the pattern of stability in
the intervals shown in Figure 1, and to evaluate
the goodness of fit between the pattern of stabili-
ty in the simulated data and the pattern of stabili-
ty in experimental data. Our modeling paradigm
capitalizes on structurally revealing temporal
patterns in experimental data but improves on
past work by modeling competing syllabic struc-
tures (both simplex and complex onset parses of
initial clusters) and replacing hypotheses stated
in the form of inequalities with quantitative in-
dices of goodness of fit between syllable parses
and experimental data.
Given a string of consonants and vowels, e.g.
CCV, the models map the simplex and complex
onset parse of that string to distinct coordination
topologies. The coordination topologies reflect
the temporal relations underlying the segmental
sequence (Gafos, 2002: p. 316). Differences in
temporal structure at this level yield the distinct
temporal alignment patterns schematized in Fig-
ure 1.
Figure 2 shows how the syllable parse, simp-
lex or complex, determines the relative temporal
alignment of the segments involved. The boxes
at the bottom of the figure (V rectangles)
represent the temporal extent of the syllable nuc-
leus, the vowel, which depends on the syllable
parse. On a simplex onset parse (Figure 2a) the
vowel is aligned to the midpoint of the imme-
diately prevocalic consonant regardless of the

number of preceding consonants. On a complex
onset parse (Figure 2b) the vowel is aligned to
the midpoint of the entire cluster of prevocalic
consonants. These temporal alignment schemas
have been proposed to underlie the experimental
results we reviewed in Section 1.
The model simulates the temporal organiza-
tion of words with one, two, and sometimes three
initial consonant clusters on the basis of a proba-
bilistic interpretation of the temporal structure
encoded in the syllable parse (simplex or com-
plex). In addition, the model has three phonetic
parameters, kp, kipi, and V, which determine, re-
spectively, consonant plateau duration, the dura-
tion between consonant plateaus, and vowel du-
ration. These latter parameters can be set using
estimates from the phonetic record.
As summarized in Figure 2, word simulation
proceeds from the immediately prevocalic con-
sonant, Cn . The timestamp of the release of
this consonant, R el
Cn , is drawn from a Gaussian
distribution. The timestamp of the achievement
of target of this consonant, Tar
Cn , is determined
by subtracting consonant plateau duration, kp,
from Rel
Cn and adding an error term. Additional
prevocalic consonants, e.g. C1 in #C1C2V, are
determined with reference to the immediately
preceding consonant. For example, the time-
stamp of the release of Cn_ 1 , Rel
Cn _1 , is deter-
mined by subtracting the inter-plateau interval,
kipi, from Tar
Cn and adding a noise term. As noted
above, the alignment of the vowel relative to the
prevocalic consonant(s) is dictated by the sylla-
ble parse.
Once the temporal structure of the input seg-
mental strings was generated, the stability of
each target interval, the left edge to anchor, cen-
ter to anchor and right edge to anchor interval
was calculated across words in the simulated da-
ta. For these intervals, the offset of the vowel
was used as the anchor point.
In light of past work indicating that phonetic
heuristics for syllable structure may change as
the level of variability in the data increases
(Shaw et al., 2009), we also manipulated the va-
riability of the simulated intervals. We did this
by varying the standard deviation of the vowel
offset (from 0 to 70 ms in 15 discrete 5 ms in-
crements such that anchors 1, 2, 3...15 have a
standard deviation of 0 ms, 5 ms, 10 ms...70 ms,
respectively). Since the vowel offset serves as an
anchor in right-delimiting all of the measured
intervals, increasing the standard deviation of
this point is one way to increase the level of va-
riability in all of the simulated intervals uniform-
ly. This effectively allows the level of variability
in simulated data to match the level of variability
in experimental data.

To sum up the central idea, the task of evaluat-
ing syllable parses with experimental data has
been formulated here as the task of fitting ab-
stract coordination topologies to the experimen-
tal data. This fitting can be expressed using two
types of variables, coordination topologies and
anchor variability. In the study of biological
coordination and complex systems more general-
ly, these two variables correspond respectively to
the so-called essential and non-essential va-
riables describing the behavior of complex sys-
tems (Kugler, Kelso, &amp; Turvey, 1980: p. 13).
Essential variables specify the qualitative form
of the system under study. For us, this corres-
ponds to the syllabic parse of the phonological
string. The fundamental hypothesis entailed in
positing an abstract phonological organization
isomorphic to syllable structure is that a syllable
parse is a macroscopic organization uniform
across a variegated set of segmental identities,
lexical statistics and rate conditions, e.g. ‘plea’,
‘tree’, ‘glee’ are single syllables independent of
speech rate, frequency or phonotactic probability
(see Catford 1977: p. 13 on ‘phonological
form’).
All of the above factors, however, have left
imprints on the articulatory patterns registered in
the experimental data. Crucially, we do not know
and it may not be possible to predict for any giv-
en stimulus how each such factor or combination

of factors has affected the intervals quantified.
Taken together, then, these and other yet un-
known factors have introduced noise in the inter-
vals that will be measured. Therefore, in formu-
lating the modeling problem of diagnosing sylla-
ble structure in experimental data, we let varia-
bility be one of the non-essential variables mani-
pulated in the fitting process. The anchor offers a
convenient location for introducing this variabili-
ty into the intervals. In the discussion that fol-
lows, the non-essential variable of anchor index
will be used to refer to the amount of variability
introduced into the intervals through the anchor.

Our models allow syllabic parses of the same
string to be compared directly and evaluated
quantitatively by determining which parse results
in a better fit to the data.
As an index of interval stability, we employ
the relative standard deviation of the three inter-
vals shown in Figure 1, calculated across sets of
words with one, two, and sometimes three initial
consonants. Relative standard deviation, hence-
forth RSD, is calculated by dividing the standard
deviation of an interval by its mean duration.
Substantive reasons for using RSD as a depen-
dent variable and not the standard deviation or
mean duration of the intervals are described, re-
spectively, in Shaw et al. (2009: p. 203) and
Shaw (2010: p. 111-112).
Model performance was evaluated on the basis
of two test statistics: the R2 statistic and the F
statistic. The R2 statistic provides a measure of
goodness of fit capable of detecting gradient im-
provement (or degradation) in model perfor-
mance as a function of parameter values. The F
statistic, on the other hand, is used to evaluate
model performance in the following way. Hits or
misses for each pairing of simulated RSDs and
data RSDs will be determined based upon p val-
ues generated from the F statistic. The criterion
of p &lt; .01 will be interpreted as successful rejec-
tion of the null hypothesis (that the RSD of all
intervals is equal) and constitute a hit while fail-
ure to reject the null hypothesis constitutes a
miss. This method of interpreting the F statistic
provides a direct way to evaluate model perfor-
mance for each run of the simulation. Across
multiple runs of the simulation, the ratio of hits
to total runs (hits + misses) provides a hit rate
which summarizes the performance of a syllable
parse in matching the experimental data.
This method of model evaluation has a con-
ceptual antecedent in other work in probabilistic
grammar. The hit rate as described above plays a
similar role in model evaluation as the confi-
dence scores employed in Albright and Hayes
(2003). The probabilistic rules of English past
tense formation developed in that paper are asso-
ciated with a reliability index. Albright and
Hayes (2003) refer to this as a raw confidence
score. The raw confidence score of a rule is the
likelihood that the rule applies when its envi-
ronment is met. The score is the ratio of the
number of times that a particular rule applies,
hits, by the number of times in which the envi-
ronment for the rule is present in the data, the
rule’s scope. For example, the rule for the Eng-
lish past tense [ɪ] 4 [ʌ]/ {l,r}___ŋ correctly de-
rives forms such as sprung from spring and flung
from fling, but makes the wrong prediction,
brung and not brought, for bring. Of the 4253
verbs employed in the Albright and Hayes
(2003) learning set, the environment of the
spring-sprung rule occurs 9 times and the rule
applies correctly in 6 of those cases yielding a
raw confidence score of .667. In contrast, the
most general rule for the English past tense 0 4
d / X ____ has a scope identical to the size of the
data set, 4253, and applies in 4034 cases yielding
a raw confidence score of .949. In the case at
hand, that of syllable structure, the hit rate pro-
posed above plays a similar role to that of the
confidence score. It provides a simple statistic
summarizing the fit of a syllable parse to data.
The value of the non-essential variable (anc-
hor index) that maximizes the R2 statistic is also
informative in evaluating syllable structure.
When the syllable parse is correct, then large
amounts of noise added to the intervals may be
harmful, pushing the model output away from
patterns dictated by the essential variable. On the
other hand, when the syllable parse is wrong,
then increases in noise may improve model per-
formance by pushing the intervals in the direc-
tion of the correct syllable parse on some trials.
Since noise is inserted into the intervals through
the anchor, comparing the anchor indices that
maximize R2 may be informative in evaluating
syllable parses. A lower anchor index indicates a
better-fitting syllable parse.
The F and R2 statistics used to provide quan-
titative evaluation of syllabic structure as de-
scribed above are obtained by plotting RSDs
measured in the data (x-axis) against correspond-
ing RSDs simulated by the model (y-axis), and

fitting a regression line to these coordinates us-
ing the least squares method. A representative
plot is shown in Figure 3. The x-axis shows the
RSD of the three intervals of interest for the bul-
ha~sbulha~ksbulha triad as reported in Shaw et
al. (2009). These are plotted against RSDs simu-
lated by the model given a simplex onset parse
and different levels of anchor variability. For
simplicity in presentation, just four of the fifteen
anchors simulated are shown in the figure. The
standard deviation of these representative anc-
hors is as follows: anchor 1 = 0 ms, anchor 7 =
30 ms, anchor 11 = 50 ms, and anchor 14 = 65
ms.
Figure 3 shows that R2 is highest when the
simplex onset parse is paired with anchor 7. At
this level of anchor variability, the simplex onset
parse provides a perfect fit to the data. At both
lower (anchor 1) and higher (anchor 11) levels of
anchor variability, the fit to the data is degraded.

As illustrated in Figure 3, model performance
is assessed by calculating the regression line on
the basis of all three measured intervals at once.
In doing so, the regression line captures the rela-
tionship between different measured intervals, or
the pattern of interval stability. Since it is not the
absolute value of the RSD of an interval but ra-
ther the relations between the RSDs of different
intervals that is of theoretical interest, this is an
important aspect of the fitting procedure.
For simulations reported below, the phonetic
parameters discussed around Figure 2 are based
on typical values for the languages under consid-
eration. For American English, the values of
these parameters used in the simulations were: kp
= 45 ms; kipi = 0 ms, and V = 230 ms. The error
term, s, associated with each consonantal land-
mark has a standard deviation of 14 ms. For Mo-
roccan Arabic, the parameter values were: kp =
42 ms; kipi = 66 ms, V = 196 ms. The error term
was set to 20 ms. The results below are based on
1000 runs of the simulation for each word set.

The simpex and complex onset parses were eva-
luated against three corpora using the procedure
described above. The first two corpora are re-
ported in Browman and Goldstein (1988) and
Shaw et al. (2009) and provide relevant data on
American English and Moroccan Arabic, respec-
tively. Each of these studies reports articulatory
data on just one speaker. The third corpus is a
subset of the Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam
Speech Production Database (Westbury, 1994).
The sample analyzed here contains data from
thirty-three speakers of American English.

Our first American English data set draws from
work of Browman and Goldstein (1988) which
provides measurements of the stability of three
relevant temporal intervals, left edge to anchor,
right edge to anchor, and center to anchor, calcu-
lated over the following word set: [pot], [sot],
[lot], [spot], [splot], [plot]. Interval stability was
reported in terms of the standard deviation of
each interval calculated across the word set.
In order to make these results directly compa-
rable to those for Moroccan Arabic to be dis-
cussed in the next section, the relative standard
deviation (RSD) of the English productions was
calculated by dividing the standard deviation of
each interval by the mean of that interval. Al-
though Browman and Goldstein (1988) do not
report the mean duration of the intervals, they
provide a figure for each word and a scale (1 cm
= 135 ms) for the figures allowing the relevant
intervals to be measured. For each word, the du-
ration of the three intervals of interest was meas-
ured from the figure and the standard deviation
of the intervals was calculated across words. The
resulting RSD values are shown in Table 1.
The RSDs from the data were compared to
values output from model simulations based on a
simplex onset parse, e.g., [sp.lot]—[p.lot]—[lot],
and a complex onset parse, e.g.,
[splot]—[plot]—[lot], of the target strings. One run
of the simulation generates ten repetitions of

dex).

The hit rate for the complex onset parse was
95.5% compared to just 57.7% for the simplex

parse provides a better fit to this data than the
simplex onset parse. Moreover, the anchor index
that maximizes R2 for the complex onset parse is
lower (anchor 3) than for the simplex parse (anc-
hor 12). This further indicates that the complex

The results above indicate that the complex onset
parse provides a better fit to the English data
than the simplex onset parse. This section eva-
luates Moroccan Arabic data against these same
syllabic parses. The data come from Shaw et al.
(2009) which reports the RSD of the intervals of
interest for seven word sets containing dyads or
triads differing only in the number of initial con-
sonants, e.g. bulha-sbulha-ksbulha. The word
sets and the reported RSD of the intervals are
summarized in Table 2.
For each word set, the model simulated cor-
responding word types. That is, for triads, e.g.,
bulha-sbulha-ksbulha, the model simulated 10
repetitions of words beginning with one, two,
and three initial consonants, and, for dyads, e.g.
tab-ktab, 10 repetitions of words beginning with
one and two consonants. The model simulated
word sets under each of the competing syllabic
parses and evaluated the fit of each syllabic parse
to the experimental data.
The resulting hit rates are summarized in Ta-
ble 3. For each of the target word sets, the simp-
lex onset parse shows a clear advantage in fitting
the data. Hit rates for the simplex parse are above
75.4% in all cases and the hit rate for the com-
plex onset parse never rises above 00.0%. More-
over, the anchor indices that maximize R2 for the
simplex onset parse are low, ranging from anchor
1 to anchor 7. For the complex onset parse, the
highest variability anchor (anchor 15) provides
the best fit to the data in all cases.

In sum, the simplex onset parse outperforms
the complex onset parse on Moroccan Arabic
data. The opposite result was obtained for Amer-
ican English. For English, it was the complex
onset parse that achieved a higher hit rate with a

Each of the data sets evaluated thus far were
contributed by a single speaker. In these data the
patterns of interval stability clearly reveal tem-
poral organization in terms of syllables. To eva-
luate whether the model continues to distinguish
syllabic parses when phonetic heuristics break
down, we now turn to a corpus of less controlled
stimuli from multiple speakers with a high de-
gree of inter-speaker variability.

Under some conditions, stability-based phonetic
heuristics break down as reliable indicators of
syllable structure. This is known to occur, for
example, when the level of overall variability in
the intervals is high (Shaw et al., 2009).
In controlled experimental studies, as can be
seen in Figure 1, neither of the two syllabic
parses, simplex or complex, has been observed to
show the left edge to anchor interval as more
stable than the center to anchor and right edge to
anchor intervals. At high levels of variability,
however, the probabilistic model developed in
our work can produce patterns whereby the left
edge to anchor interval is more stable than the
other two intervals. This occurs regardless of the
syllable parse when the anchor index is high (e.g.
15), which represents a high degree of variability
in the intervals (the reason why high interval va-
riability results in this pattern is explained in
Shaw et al. 2009). Under these conditions of
high variability, both values of the essential vari-
able (simplex and complex onset parses) gener-
ate a pattern whereby the left edge to anchor in-
terval has a lower RSD than the center to anchor
interval and the right edge to anchor interval.
Thus, at this level of variability, stability-based
phonetic heuristics, i.e., center to anchor stability
implies a complex onset parse, are rendered inef-
fective in distinguishing syllabic parses.
When variability leads competing syllable
parses to the same predictions in terms of inequa-
lities (both models show left edge to anchor sta-
bility), is our modeling paradigm still capable of
distinguishing syllabic parses? To address this
question, we need a corpus with the requisite
level of variability.
The Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Speech Pro-
duction Database provides recordings of a varie-
ty of tasks including production of sentences,
passages and word lists from fifty-seven speakers
of American English (Westbury, 1994). Al-
though not all speakers completed all tasks and
some tokens have missing data which make them
unusable for this analysis, it remains an archive
of articulatory data that is extremely impressive
in size. Within this archive there are various
near-minimal pairs that can be used to evaluate
syllable structure using the methods employed
above. Here we report on thirty-three speakers’
productions of the dyad row~grows. Calculating
interval stability across multiple speaker samples
of this word dyad is one way to introduce varia-
bility into the intervals and, by doing so, provide
an interesting test case for our proposed methods.
The target word row was produced in the sen-
tence Things in a row provide a sense of order.
This sentence is one of several unrelated sen-
tences included in Task #60 within the X-ray
microbeam corpus. The word grows was pro-
duced in the sentence That noise problem grows
more annoying each day, which is included in
Task #56. Although these target words were pro-
duced in different syntactic frames and occur in
different phrasal positions, we assume, following
standard phonological assumptions, that all in-
stances of /gr/ and /r/ were syllabified identically,
namely, that they are parsed into complex sylla-
ble onsets. To test this assumption, we ask
whether the models converge on the same result.
In all respects except for the determination of
the anchor point, the quantification of the X-ray
microbeam data followed the same procedure
described for Electromagnetic Articulometry da-
ta in Shaw et al. (2009). To determine the anchor
point, we followed past work on English (Brow-
man and Goldstein 1988, Honorof and Browman
1995) by using an acoustic landmark, the offset
of voicing in the vowel, as the anchor point right-
delimiting the intervals of interest. This was done
for the following reason. The target words in this
case are not matched at the right edge of the syl-
lable (grows ends in s while row ends in a vowel)
and this makes it difficult to determine a com-
mon articulatory anchor across words. The arti-
culatory landmarks that left-delimit the intervals
of interest were the same as for the English and
Arabic data discussed above.
The duration of the three intervals, left edge to
anchor, center to anchor and right edge to anc-
hor, were measured for one repetition of each
word, row and grows, for thirty-three speakers.
The variation across speakers in the duration of
these intervals was substantial. As an example,
the left edge to anchor interval of row ranges
from 193 ms (Subject 44) to 518 ms (Subject
53). The mean, standard deviation and relative
standard deviation of the intervals calculated
across row and grows are provided in Table 4.

<page confidence="0.99465">

<bodyText confidence="0.998815545454546">
In this data the RSD of the left edge to anchor
interval is lower than the RSD of both the center
to anchor and right edge to anchor intervals.
From the perspective of phonetic heuristics of
syllable structure, this fact by itself is not par-
ticularly revealing. Both syllabic parses predict-
this should be the case at very high levels of va-
riability. This data set therefore provides a chal-
lenge to phonetic heuristics stated in the form of
directional inequalities and an appropriate test of
the quantitative methods developed here.

to the RSD values of the three intervals of inter-

the model simulated 10 repetitions of words be-
ginning with one and two consonants. The same

quent anchor increases by 5 ms so that anchor 15

The anchor index that maximized R2 for each

The results of the model fitting reveal that the
complex onset parse provides a superior fit to the
data. The complex onset parse achieves a higher
hit rate (99.0% vs. 91.8%) with a less variable
anchor (anchor 6 vs. anchor 11) than the simplex
onset parse. This result demonstrates that the
model can distinguish syllabic parses even in
noisy data contributed by multiple speakers.
Since the target words, row and grows, were
produced in different environments, there are
potentially a number of interacting factors in-
fluencing the pattern of temporal stability in the
data. A model incorporating, for example, pro-
sodic structure above the level of the syllable
may identify interactions between syllable and
higher levels of prosodic structure. We plan to
explore models of this sort in future work. It re-
mains an important result of the current model
that competing parses of a given string can be
distinguished in the data even at levels of varia-
bility that obscure phonetic heuristics for syllable
structure.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999325">
There is a growing body of evidence indicating
that the temporal dimension provides a rich
source of information revealing phonological
structure. In the domain syllables, the relation
between temporal patterns in experimental data
and qualitative aspects of phonological structure
has often taken the form of statements expressing
inequalities, e.g., a complex onset parse implies
that the center to anchor interval is more stable
than the right/left edge to anchor intervals. Pho-
netic heuristics of this sort are valid only under
certain conditions. The models developed in this
paper generate finer-grained quantitative predic-
tions of syllabic structure based on a probabilis-
tic interpretation of temporal organization. Our
models make predictions not just about stability
inequalities but also about the permissible degree
to which interval stabilities may differ from one
another under a given syllable parse. Crucially,
these predictions allow for evaluation of compet-
ing syllable parses even when statements in the
form of inequalities do not.
As the phonological literature is replete with
debates regarding the syllabification of conso-
nant clusters, the tools developed here have im-
mediate application. They allow rigorous evalua-
tion of syllable structure on the basis of experi-
mental data.

<abstract confidence="0.997502272727273">This paper develops computational tools for evaluating competing syllabic parses of a phonological string on the basis of temporal patterns in speech production data. This is done by constructing models linking syllable parses to patterns of coordination between articulatory events. Data simulated from different syllabic parses are evaluated against experimental data from American English and Moroccan Arabic, two languages claimed to parse similar strings of segments into different syllabic structures. Results implicate a tautosyllabic parse of initial consonant clusters in English and a heterosyllabic parse of initial clusters in Arabic, in accordance with theoretical work on the syllable structure of these languages. It is further demonstrated that the model can correctly diagnose syllable structure even when previously proposed phonetic heuristics for such structure do not clearly point to the correct diagnosis.</abstract>

This method of interpreting the F statistic provides a direct way to evaluate model performance for each run of the simulation. Across multiple runs of the simulation, the ratio of hits to total runs (hits + misses) provides a hit rate which summarizes the performance of a syllable parse in matching the experimental data. This method of model evaluation has a conceptual antecedent in other work in probabilistic grammar. The hit rate as described above plays a similar role in model evaluation as the confidence scores employed in Albright and Hayes (2003). The probabilistic rules of English past tense formation developed in that paper are associated with a reliability index. Albright and Hayes (2003) refer to this as a raw confidence score. The raw confidence score of a rule is the likelihood that the rule applies when its environment is met. The score is the ratio of the number of times that a particular rule applies, hits, by the number of times in which the environment for the rule is present in the data, the rule’s scope.

The error term, s, associated with each consonantal landmark has a standard deviation of 14 ms. For Moroccan Arabic, the parameter values were: kp = 42 ms; kipi = 66 ms, V = 196 ms. The error term was set to 20 ms. The results below are based on 1000 runs of the simulation for each word set. 4 Results The simpex and complex onset parses were evaluated against three corpora using the procedure described above.

To test this assumption, we ask whether the models converge on the same result. In all respects except for the determination of the anchor point, the quantification of the X-ray microbeam data followed the same procedure described for Electromagnetic Articulometry data in Shaw et al. (2009). To determine the anchor point, we followed past work on English (Browman and Goldstein 1988, Honorof and Browman 1995) by using an acoustic landmark, the offset of voicing in the vowel, as the anchor point rightdelimiting the intervals of interest. This was done for the following reason. The target words in this case are not matched at the right edge of the syllable (grows ends in s while row ends in a vowel) and this makes it difficult to determine a common articulatory anchor across words. The articulatory landmarks that left-delimit the intervals of interest were the same as for the English and Arabic data discussed above. The duration of the three intervals, left edge to anchor,</context>

Essential variables specify the qualitative form of the system under study. For us, this corresponds to the syllabic parse of the phonological string. The fundamental hypothesis entailed in positing an abstract phonological organization isomorphic to syllable structure is that a syllable parse is a macroscopic organization uniform across a variegated set of segmental identities, lexical statistics and rate conditions, e.g. ‘plea’, ‘tree’, ‘glee’ are single syllables independent of speech rate, frequency or phonotactic probability (see Catford 1977: p. 13 on ‘phonological form’). All of the above factors, however, have left imprints on the articulatory patterns registered in the experimental data.

For example, English (Kahn, 1976) and Georgian (Vogt, 1971) are claimed to parse initial clusters into complex syllable onsets. In contrast, Berber and Moroccan Arabic are claimed to parse initial clusters heterosyllabically, [#C.CV-], because the syllable structure of these languages allows at most one consonant (simplex onset) per syllable onset (Dell &amp; Elmedlaoui, 2002). Of direct relevance to these claims are patterns of temporal stability in the production of initial clusters. In those cases where speech production data are available, languages that allow complex onsets exhibit patterns of temporal stability that differ from languages that allow only syllables with simplex syllable onsets.

Given a string of consonants and vowels, e.g. CCV, the models map the simplex and complex onset parse of that string to distinct coordination topologies. The coordination topologies reflect the temporal relations underlying the segmental sequence (Gafos, 2002: p. 316). Differences in temporal structure at this level yield the distinct temporal alignment patterns schematized in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows how the syllable parse, simplex or complex, determines the relative temporal alignment of the segments involved. The boxes at the bottom of the figure (V rectangles) represent the temporal extent of the syllable nucleus, the vowel, which depends on the syllable parse. On a simplex onset parse (Figure 2a) the vowel is aligned to the midpoint of the immediately prevocalic consonant regardless of the 55 number of preceding consonants. On a complex onset</context>

To determine the anchor point, we followed past work on English (Browman and Goldstein 1988, Honorof and Browman 1995) by using an acoustic landmark, the offset of voicing in the vowel, as the anchor point rightdelimiting the intervals of interest. This was done for the following reason. The target words in this case are not matched at the right edge of the syllable (grows ends in s while row ends in a vowel) and this makes it difficult to determine a common articulatory anchor across words. The articulatory landmarks that left-delimit the intervals of interest were the same as for the English and Arabic data discussed above.

Of direct relevance to these claims are patterns of temporal stability in the production of initial clusters. In those cases where speech production data are available, languages that allow complex onsets exhibit patterns of temporal stability that differ from languages that allow only syllables with simplex syllable onsets. These observed temporal differences have been quantified in terms of the relative stability of intervals as calculated across words beginning with one, two and three initial consonants (Browman &amp; Goldstein, 1988; Byrd, 1995; Honorof &amp; Browman, 1995; Shaw, Gafos, Hoole, &amp; Zeroual, 2009).

Results implicate a tautosyllabic parse of initial consonant clusters in English and a heterosyllabic parse of initial clusters in Arabic, in accordance with theoretical work on the syllable structure of these languages. It is further demonstrated that the model can correctly diagnose syllable structure even when previously proposed phonetic heuristics for such structure do not clearly point to the correct diagnosis. 1 Introduction Languages are claimed to differ in how wordinitial consonant clusters are parsed into higher level phonological structures. For example, English (Kahn, 1976) and Georgian (Vogt, 1971) are claimed to parse initial clusters into complex syllable onsets. In contrast, Berber and Moroccan Arabic are claimed to parse initial clusters heterosyllabically, [#C.CV-], because the syllable structure of these languages allows at most one consonant (simplex onset) per syllable onset (Dell &amp; Elmedlaoui, 2002). Of direct relevance to these claims are patterns of temporal stability in the production of initial clusters.

To sum up the central idea, the task of evaluating syllable parses with experimental data has been formulated here as the task of fitting abstract coordination topologies to the experimental data. This fitting can be expressed using two types of variables, coordination topologies and anchor variability. In the study of biological coordination and complex systems more generally, these two variables correspond respectively to the so-called essential and non-essential variables describing the behavior of complex systems (Kugler, Kelso, &amp; Turvey, 1980: p. 13). Essential variables specify the qualitative form of the system under study. For us, this corresponds to the syllabic parse of the phonological string. The fundamental hypothesis entailed in positing an abstract phonological organization isomorphic to syllable structure is that a syllable parse is a macroscopic organization uniform across a variegated set of segmental identities, lexical statistics and rate conditions, e.g. ‘plea’, ‘tree’, ‘glee’ are single syllables independent of speech rate, frequency or phonotactic probability (see Catford 1977: p. 13 on ‘phonological form’).

As noted above, the alignment of the vowel relative to the prevocalic consonant(s) is dictated by the syllable parse. Once the temporal structure of the input segmental strings was generated, the stability of each target interval, the left edge to anchor, center to anchor and right edge to anchor interval was calculated across words in the simulated data. For these intervals, the offset of the vowel was used as the anchor point. In light of past work indicating that phonetic heuristics for syllable structure may change as the level of variability in the data increases (Shaw et al., 2009), we also manipulated the variability of the simulated intervals. We did this by varying the standard deviation of the vowel offset (from 0 to 70 ms in 15 discrete 5 ms increments such that anchors 1, 2, 3...15 have a standard deviation of 0 ms, 5 ms, 10 ms...70 ms, respectively). Since the vowel offset serves as an anchor in right-delimiting all of the measured intervals, increasing the standard deviation of this point is one way to increase the level of variability in all of the simulated intervals uniformly.

A lower anchor index indicates a better-fitting syllable parse. The F and R2 statistics used to provide quantitative evaluation of syllabic structure as described above are obtained by plotting RSDs measured in the data (x-axis) against corresponding RSDs simulated by the model (y-axis), and 57 fitting a regression line to these coordinates using the least squares method. A representative plot is shown in Figure 3. The x-axis shows the RSD of the three intervals of interest for the bulha~sbulha~ksbulha triad as reported in Shaw et al. (2009). These are plotted against RSDs simulated by the model given a simplex onset parse and different levels of anchor variability. For simplicity in presentation, just four of the fifteen anchors simulated are shown in the figure. The standard deviation of these representative anchors is as follows: anchor 1 = 0 ms, anchor 7 = 30 ms, anchor 11 = 50 ms, and anchor 14 = 65 ms. Figure 3 shows that R2 is highest when the simplex onset parse is paired with anchor 7. At this level of anchor variability, the simplex onset parse provides a perfect fit to the data.

The error term, s, associated with each consonantal landmark has a standard deviation of 14 ms. For Moroccan Arabic, the parameter values were: kp = 42 ms; kipi = 66 ms, V = 196 ms. The error term was set to 20 ms. The results below are based on 1000 runs of the simulation for each word set. 4 Results The simpex and complex onset parses were evaluated against three corpora using the procedure described above. The first two corpora are reported in Browman and Goldstein (1988) and Shaw et al. (2009) and provide relevant data on American English and Moroccan Arabic, respectively. Each of these studies reports articulatory data on just one speaker. The third corpus is a subset of the Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Speech Production Database (Westbury, 1994). The sample analyzed here contains data from thirty-three speakers of American English. 4.1 American English (single speaker) Our first American English data set draws from work of Browman and Goldstein (1988) which provides measurements of the stability of three relevant temporal intervals, left edge to anchor, right edge to anchor, and cen</context>

Moreover, the anchor index that maximizes R2 for the complex onset parse is lower (anchor 3) than for the simplex parse (anchor 12). This further indicates that the complex onset parse outperforms the simplex onset parse on this data. 4.2 Moroccan Arabic (single speaker) The results above indicate that the complex onset parse provides a better fit to the English data than the simplex onset parse. This section evaluates Moroccan Arabic data against these same syllabic parses. The data come from Shaw et al. (2009) which reports the RSD of the intervals of interest for seven word sets containing dyads or triads differing only in the number of initial consonants, e.g. bulha-sbulha-ksbulha. The word sets and the reported RSD of the intervals are summarized in Table 2. For each word set, the model simulated corresponding word types. That is, for triads, e.g., bulha-sbulha-ksbulha, the model simulated 10 repetitions of words beginning with one, two, and three initial consonants, and, for dyads, e.g. tab-ktab, 10 repetitions of words beginning with one and two consonants.

To evaluate whether the model continues to distinguish syllabic parses when phonetic heuristics break down, we now turn to a corpus of less controlled stimuli from multiple speakers with a high degree of inter-speaker variability. 4.3 American English (multi-speaker data) Under some conditions, stability-based phonetic heuristics break down as reliable indicators of syllable structure. This is known to occur, for example, when the level of overall variability in the intervals is high (Shaw et al., 2009). In controlled experimental studies, as can be seen in Figure 1, neither of the two syllabic parses, simplex or complex, has been observed to show the left edge to anchor interval as more stable than the center to anchor and right edge to anchor intervals. At high levels of variability, however, the probabilistic model developed in our work can produce patterns whereby the left edge to anchor interval is more stable than the other two intervals. This occurs regardless of the syllable parse when the anchor index is high (e.g. 15), which represents a high degree of variability in the intervals </context>

To determine the anchor point, we followed past work on English (Browman and Goldstein 1988, Honorof and Browman 1995) by using an acoustic landmark, the offset of voicing in the vowel, as the anchor point rightdelimiting the intervals of interest. This was done for the following reason. The target words in this case are not matched at the right edge of the syllable (grows ends in s while row ends in a vowel) and this makes it difficult to determine a common articulatory anchor across words. The articulatory landmarks that left-delimit the intervals of interest were the same as for the Engli</context>

It is further demonstrated that the model can correctly diagnose syllable structure even when previously proposed phonetic heuristics for such structure do not clearly point to the correct diagnosis. 1 Introduction Languages are claimed to differ in how wordinitial consonant clusters are parsed into higher level phonological structures. For example, English (Kahn, 1976) and Georgian (Vogt, 1971) are claimed to parse initial clusters into complex syllable onsets. In contrast, Berber and Moroccan Arabic are claimed to parse initial clusters heterosyllabically, [#C.CV-], because the syllable structure of these languages allows at most one consonant (simplex onset) per syllable onset (Dell &amp; Elmedlaoui, 2002). Of direct relevance to these claims are patterns of temporal stability in the production of initial clusters. In those cases where speech production data are available, languages that allow complex onsets exhibit patterns of temporal stability that differ from languages that allow </context>

The results below are based on 1000 runs of the simulation for each word set. 4 Results The simpex and complex onset parses were evaluated against three corpora using the procedure described above. The first two corpora are reported in Browman and Goldstein (1988) and Shaw et al. (2009) and provide relevant data on American English and Moroccan Arabic, respectively. Each of these studies reports articulatory data on just one speaker. The third corpus is a subset of the Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Speech Production Database (Westbury, 1994). The sample analyzed here contains data from thirty-three speakers of American English. 4.1 American English (single speaker) Our first American English data set draws from work of Browman and Goldstein (1988) which provides measurements of the stability of three relevant temporal intervals, left edge to anchor, right edge to anchor, and center to anchor, calculated over the following word set: [pot], [sot], [lot], [spot], [splot], [plot]. Interval stability was reported in terms of the standard deviation of each interval calculated across the word set. In order to make these results directly</context>

When variability leads competing syllable parses to the same predictions in terms of inequalities (both models show left edge to anchor stability), is our modeling paradigm still capable of distinguishing syllabic parses? To address this question, we need a corpus with the requisite level of variability. The Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Speech Production Database provides recordings of a variety of tasks including production of sentences, passages and word lists from fifty-seven speakers of American English (Westbury, 1994). Although not all speakers completed all tasks and some tokens have missing data which make them unusable for this analysis, it remains an archive of articulatory data that is extremely impressive in size. Within this archive there are various near-minimal pairs that can be used to evaluate syllable structure using the methods employed above. Here we report on thirty-three speakers’ productions of the dyad row~grows. Calculating interval stability across multiple speaker samples of this word dyad is one way to introduce variability into the intervals and, by doing so, provide an interesting t</context>
