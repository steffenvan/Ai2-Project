Over the course of two summer projects, we developed a general purpose natural language system
which advances the state-of-the-art in several areas. The system contains demonstrated
advancements in part-of-speech tagging, end-of-sentence detection, and coreference resolution. In
addition, we believe that we have strong maximal noun phrase detection, and subject-verb-object
recognition and a pattern matching language well suited to a range of tasks. Other features of the
system include modularity and interchangeability of components, rapid component integration and a
debugging environment.
The demo will feature aspects of the system currently being used to develop a coreference
resolution engine in preparation for MUC-7, in addition to an information extraction task done over
the summer of 1996. Two aspects of the system will be featured prominently, a diagnostic tool for
evaluating system output using SRA&apos;s discourse tagging tool (DTT) and the MOP pattern matching
language.
The diagnostic tool takes a coreference annotated text to be evaluated, an answer key assumed to
be correct, and produces various diagnostics which evaluate system performance. Areas of
evaluation include:

<listItem confidence="0.999858833333333">
• Classification of coreference links into correct, sins of commission(precision errors), sins of
omission (recall errors)
• Noun phrase detection errors
• Filters on what sorts of links to evaluate
• Support of system trace functions in the DTT
• Fast implementation of MUC-6 scoring algorithm

<bodyText confidence="0.999949166666667">
In addition, we present MOP (Mother of Per1), a pattern description language developed for use in
an information extraction task and currently being used to do coreference. Patterns are described in
MOP by left-to-right enumeration of components, with each component specifing at various levels of
descriptive granularity. The patterns are compiled into Perl scripts, which perform back-tracking
search on the input text. MOP also allows for rapid integration of a variety of analytical modules,
such as part-of-speech taggers and parsers.
