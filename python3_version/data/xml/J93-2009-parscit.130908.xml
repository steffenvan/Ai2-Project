Much psycholinguistic experimentation in recent years has been concerned with the
nature of the human processes that give rise to the difficulties associated with sen-
tences such as The author read the review smiled and Whilst he was writing the review flowed
onto the page. The problem, of course, is that language is ambiguous, and these ex-
amples illustrate that in the face of local ambiguity, the human processor chooses to
pursue just one analysis, even if that analysis subsequently turns out to be false. The
fact that there exist such consistent preferences (consistent across examples and across
different people) suggests that the decision about which analysis to pursue is not arbi-
trary. Studying such examples may thus tell us something about the nature of human
sentence processing, and even about the relationship between grammar and process,
a topic of interest to psycholinguists, linguists, and computational linguists.
Bradley Pritchett&apos;s book takes the reader through a wide range of examples of so-
called &amp;quot;garden path&amp;quot; sentences, and reminds us that there are two questions that any
theory of sentence processing must address: What is the cause of the various parsing
preferences? And what determines the ease of re-analysis? The second question is
posed in the face of materials such as those above that require conscious effort, and
others that require no conscious re-analysis but do nonetheless require some syntactic
restructuring (compare He knew the book well and He knew the book was interesting, which
differ in terms of the phrasal position to which the book is assigned). In the brief
summary that follows, I shall gloss some of the main claims purely for the sake of
brevity.
Two principles are proposed, one to explain why certain analyses are chosen over
others, and another to explain why certain forms of syntactic reanalysis are problem-
atic. Theta attachment proposes, in effect, that at any moment the processor attempts
to map as many thematic roles onto as many arguments as possible. Pritchett is clear,
however, that the semantic content of the roles is largely irrelevant: what matters is
the number of roles and their configurational position. He then proposes the theta
reanalysis constraint, which states, again in effect, that the processor cannot reassign a
role to an argument if the new role comes from outside the theta domain of the original
role. Over the course of a very rigorous examination of how these principles account
for a large variety of parsing preferences and associated reanalysis phenomena, the
two principles evolve into generalized theta attachment (&amp;quot;every principle of the syntax
attempts to be maximally satisfied at every point during processing&amp;quot;) and the on-line
locality constraint (&amp;quot;the target position ... assumed by a constituent must be governed
or dominated by its source position ... , otherwise attachment is impossible&amp;quot;). Both
principles are cast in the framework of Government—Binding theory.

The arguments are persuasive, and the work deserves to command as much in-
terest as previous work by John Kimball, Lyn Frazier, and others. Anyone with an
interest in sentence processing and syntactic ambiguity and the relationship between
grammatical knowledge (competence) and processing (performance) should buy this
book. I myself think it is one of the better books on my shelves. But that is not to
say that I believe that Pritchett&apos;s account is exactly right. In particular, there are a
number of empirical issues that the account raises that deserve exploration, as well as
meta-theoretic issues that may themselves arouse some controversy.
A definite plus with Pritchett&apos;s work is that his theory is sufficiently detailed
to allow predictions to be made about precisely when processing difficulty will be
experienced. With regard to empirical validation, this is an important feature of the
project. Whether or not every reader will agree with Pritchett&apos;s analysis of which
examples are problematic and which are not is another matter. With regard to the
consistency of the theory, it is absolutely vital that a consensus is achieved; otherwise
the theory is severely compromised. This is one area where future psycholinguistic
experimentation may be particularly useful.
I suspect, however, that Pritchett does not view such experimentation favorably.
In one of his footnotes (n. 59), he comments on the current debate in the literature
between theorists who argue for a purely syntactic basis for parsing preferences, and
those (such as myself) who argue for a pragmatic/contextual basis. It is true that much
of the debate has centered on how to interpret the particular methodologies involved,
and Pritchett dismisses the possibility that there are nonsyntactic elements at work by
saying that the debate &amp;quot;too often degenerates into methodological squabbling devoid
of any real theoretical interest. Rather than participate explicitly, I will simply continue
to assume, based on the sort of evidence reviewed here in chapters 1 and 2, that
parsing strategies are basically syntactic.&amp;quot; Well, that&apos;s certainly one way to cope with
the debate—the evidence reviewed in the early chapters does not include any of the
evidence that favors the contextual approach to parsing preferences.
The distinction between a syntax-only explanation of the preferences exhibited by
the sentence processor and a context-based explanation is extremely important. The
fact that controversy surrounds whether the data support one or another position is
immaterial to whether the theoretical issue is an important one. I am, naturally, biased.
Moreover, I accept that only recently has new evidence been provided that really can
tip the scales in favor of one account or another.
I raise the issue here because it highlights an important aspect of Pritchett&apos;s goal,
namely to understand better the relationship between grammar and process. At first
glance, theta attachment, as I glossed it earlier, looks as if it adds an air of &amp;quot;ecological
validity&amp;quot; to the literature on parsing preferences. It makes sense, in attempting to es-
tablish the traditional who-did-what-to-whom, to discharge as many roles as soon as
possible. Consequently, theta attachment appears to achieve some degree of explana-
tory adequacy. Even in its most generalized form, which makes appeal to the maximal
satisfaction of syntactic principles, it provides some explanatory satisfaction. From a
personal viewpoint, thinking in terms of thematic roles is useful because it allows
exactly the kind of interaction that Pritchett rejects, namely contextual.
For instance, in an increasingly lively debate, various colleagues (Mark Steedman,
Stephen Crain, and Alan Garnham) and I have argued that in appropriate contexts,
the difficulty associated with The professor told the student that he was worried about to
work harder can be eliminated. In the absence of an explicit context, the that-clause is
preferentially interpreted as a complement clause instead of a relative clause, and this
leads to a garden path on to work. Our claim is that if there are two or more students
in the context, one of whom the professor is worried about, then the processor will fail

to identify a unique referent for the student, and will therefore treat the that-clause as
a nominal modifier. This would fit in well with the view that the processor attempts
to discharge roles as soon as possible, because the recipients of roles are not referring
expressions themselves, but their referents. If you can&apos;t identify the referent, it makes
sense to do everything you can to identify it so that you can then assign a role to
it. Pritchett&apos;s position is thus compatible with the notion that referential context can
influence initial parsing decisions.
Pritchett insists that in fact his account is not to do with thematic roles, but rather
with their configurational (cf. &amp;quot;syntactic&amp;quot;) properties. Whereas I seek an explanation
for parsing preferences in terms of what syntax is for, Pritchett seeks an explanation in
terms of syntax per se. I admit that he does so convincingly. I would like to have seen
some more explanation, however, of why reanalysis requires that the new position of
a constituent must be governed or dominated by the original position. What principle
of processing forces this? Pritchett&apos;s answer is that what is required is not a principle of
processing, but a principle of grammar, and that this (i.e., the government/dominance
fact) is it. But why?
In summary, Pritchett&apos;s work is topical and radical, and will, I suspect, be influ-
ential. I do not think he&apos;s right to place the burden of explanation on grammar per
se. First, because we are not machines for building phrase markers, there is a view
that grammar serves a purpose, and that the nature of the purpose constrains the
operations of the machine. Second, because I could, in principle, build a machine that
could reanalyze constituents in violation of his reanalysis constraint (the on-line local-
ity constraint). That fact alone tells me that his account is a description of events, and
not an explanation of them. This said, the description itself is an achievement, and I
wish I&apos;d thought of it...
