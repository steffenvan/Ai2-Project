Most current statistical natural language process-
ing models use only local features so as to permit
dynamic programming in inference, but this makes
them unable to fully account for the long distance
structure that is prevalent in language use. We
show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sam-
pling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to per-
form approximate inference in factored probabilis-
tic models. By using simulated annealing in place
of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as
HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorpo-
rate non-local structure while preserving tractable
inference. We use this technique to augment an
existing CRF-based information extraction system
with long-distance dependency models, enforcing
label consistency and extraction template consis-
tency constraints. This technique results in an error
reduction of up to 9% over state-of-the-art systems
on two established information extraction tasks.

Most statistical models currently used in natural lan-
guage processing represent only local structure. Al-
though this constraint is critical in enabling tractable
model inference, it is a key limitation in many tasks,
since natural language contains a great deal of non-
local structure. A general method for solving this
problem is to relax the requirement of exact infer-
ence, substituting approximate inference algorithms
instead, thereby permitting tractable inference in
models with non-local structure. One such algo-
rithm is Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo algo-
rithm that is appropriate for inference in any factored
probabilistic model, including sequence models and
probabilistic context free grammars (Geman and Ge-
man, 1984). Although Gibbs sampling is widely
used elsewhere, there has been extremely little use
of it in natural language processing.1 Here, we use
it to add non-local dependencies to sequence models
for information extraction.
Statistical hidden state sequence models, such
as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Leek, 1997;
Freitag and McCallum, 1999), Conditional Markov
Models (CMMs) (Borthwick, 1999), and Condi-
tional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001)
are a prominent recent approach to information ex-
traction tasks. These models all encode the Markov
property: decisions about the state at a particular po-
sition in the sequence can depend only on a small lo-
cal window. It is this property which allows tractable
computation: the Viterbi, Forward Backward, and
Clique Calibration algorithms all become intractable
without it.
However, information extraction tasks can benefit
from modeling non-local structure. As an example,
several authors (see Section 8) mention the value of
enforcing label consistency in named entity recogni-
tion (NER) tasks. In the example given in Figure 1,
the second occurrence of the token Tanjug is mis-
labeled by our CRF-based statistical NER system,
because by looking only at local evidence it is un-
clear whether it is a person or organization. The first
occurrence of Tanjug provides ample evidence that
it is an organization, however, and by enforcing la-
bel consistency the system should be able to get it
right. We show how to incorporate constraints of
this form into a CRF model by using Gibbs sam-
pling instead of the Viterbi algorithm as our infer-
ence procedure, and demonstrate that this technique
yields significant improvements on two established
IE tasks.

Sequence Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999227825">
In hidden state sequence models such as HMMs,
CMMs, and CRFs, it is standard to use the Viterbi
algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm, to in-
fer the most likely hidden state sequence given the
input and the model (see, e.g., Rabiner (1989)). Al-
though this is the only tractable method for exact
computation, there are other methods for comput-
ing an approximate solution. Monte Carlo methods
are a simple and effective class of methods for ap-
proximate inference based on sampling. Imagine
we have a hidden state sequence model which de-
fines a probability distribution over state sequences
conditioned on any given input. With such a model
M we should be able to compute the conditional
probability PM(s|o) of any state sequence s =
{s0, ... , sN} given some observed input sequence
o = {o0, ... , oN}. One can then sample se-
quences from the conditional distribution defined by
the model. These samples are likely to be in high
probability areas, increasing our chances of finding
the maximum. The challenge is how to sample se-
quences efficiently from the conditional distribution
defined by the model.
Gibbs sampling provides a clever solution (Ge-
man and Geman, 1984). Gibbs sampling defines a
Markov chain in the space of possible variable as-
signments (in this case, hidden state sequences) such
that the stationary distribution of the Markov chain
is the joint distribution over the variables. Thus it
is called a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method; see Andrieu et al. (2003) for a good MCMC
tutorial. In practical terms, this means that we
can walk the Markov chain, occasionally outputting
samples, and that these samples are guaranteed to
be drawn from the target distribution. Furthermore,
the chain is defined in very simple terms: from each
state sequence we can only transition to a state se-
quence obtained by changing the state at any one
position i, and the distribution over these possible
transitions is just
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997827">
PG(s(t)|s(t−1)) = PM(s(t) i|s(t−1)
−i , o). (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999511615384616">
where s−i is all states except si. In other words, the
transition probability of the Markov chain is the con-
ditional distribution of the label at the position given
the rest of the sequence. This quantity is easy to
compute in any Markov sequence model, including
HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs. One easy way to walk
the Markov chain is to loop through the positions i
from 1 to N, and for each one, to resample the hid-
den state at that position from the distribution given
in Equation 1. By outputting complete sequences
at regular intervals (such as after resampling all N
positions), we can sample sequences from the con-
ditional distribution defined by the model.
This is still a gravely inefficient process, how-
ever. Random sampling may be a good way to es-
timate the shape of a probability distribution, but it
is not an efficient way to do what we want: find
the maximum. However, we cannot just transi-
tion greedily to higher probability sequences at each
step, because the space is extremely non-convex. We
can, however, borrow a technique from the study
of non-convex optimization and use simulated an-
nealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983). Geman and Ge-
man (1984) show that it is easy to modify a Gibbs
Markov chain to do annealing; at time t we replace
the distribution in (1) with

compared to Viterbi inference, for the two tasks addressed in
this paper: the CoNLL named entity recognition task, and the
CMU Seminar Announcements information extraction task. We
show 10 runs of Gibbs sampling in the same CRF model that
was used for Viterbi. For each run the sampler was initialized
to a random sequence, and used a linear annealing schedule that
sampled the complete sequence 1000 times. CoNLL perfor-

places all of its mass on the maximal outcome, hav-
ing the effect that the Markov chain always climbs
uphill. Thus if we gradually decrease c from 1 to
0, the Markov chain increasingly tends to go up-
hill. This annealing technique has been shown to
be an effective technique for stochastic optimization
(Laarhoven and Arts, 1987).
To verify the effectiveness of Gibbs sampling and
simulated annealing as an inference technique for
hidden state sequence models, we compare Gibbs
and Viterbi inference methods for a basic CRF, with-
out the addition of any non-local model. The results,
given in Table 1, show that if the Gibbs sampler is
run long enough, its accuracy is the same as a Viterbi
decoder.

erature (see Cowell et al. (1999)): we create a linear
chain of cliques, where each clique, c, represents the
probabilistic relationship between an adjacent pair
of states2 using a clique potential φc, which is just
a table containing a value for each possible state as-
signment. The table is not a true probability distribu-
tion, as it only accounts for local interactions within
the clique. The clique potentials themselves are de-
fined in terms of exponential models conditioned on
features of the observation sequence, and must be
instantiated for each new observation sequence. The
sequence of potentials in the clique chain then de-
fines the probability of a state sequence (given the
observation sequence) as

The clique potentials of the CRF, instantiated for
some observation sequence, can be used to easily
compute the conditional distribution over states at
a position given in Equation 1. Recall that at posi-

influenced by any other state that it shares a clique
with; in particular, when the clique size is 2, there
are 2 such cliques. In this case the Markov blanket
of the state (the minimal set of states that renders
a state conditionally independent of all other states)

5.1 CoNLL Consistency Model

Label consistency structure derives from the fact that
within a particular document, different occurrences
of a particular token sequence are unlikely to be la-
beled as different entity types. Although any one
occurrence may be ambiguous, it is unlikely that all
instances are unclear when taken together.
The CoNLL training data empirically supports the
strength of the label consistency constraint. Table 3
shows the counts of entity labels for each pair of
identical token sequences within a document, where
both are labeled as an entity. Note that inconsis-
tent labelings are very rare.6 In addition, we also

want to model subsequence constraints: having seen
Geoff Woods earlier in a document as a person is
a good indicator that a subsequent occurrence of
Woods should also be labeled as a person. How-
ever, if we examine all cases of the labelings of
other occurrences of subsequences of a labeled en-
tity, we find that the consistency constraint does not
hold nearly so strictly in this case. As an exam-
ple, one document contains references to both The
China Daily, a newspaper, and China, the country.
Counts of subsequence labelings within a document
are listed in Table 4. Note that there are many off-
diagonal entries: the China Daily case is the most
common, occurring 328 times in the dataset.
The penalties used in the long distance constraint
model for CoNLL are the Empirical Bayes estimates
taken directly from the data (Tables 3 and 4), except
that we change counts of 0 to be 1, so that the dis-
tribution remains positive. So the estimate of a PER
also being an ORG is 5
3151; there were 5 instance of
an entity being labeled as both, PER appeared 3150
times in the data, and we add 1 to this for smoothing,
because PER-MISC never occured. However, when
we have a phrase labeled differently in two differ-
ent places, continuing with the PER-ORG example,
it is unclear if we should penalize it as PER that is
also an ORG or an ORG that is also a PER. To deal
with this, we multiply the square roots of each esti-
mate together to form the penalty term. The penalty
term is then multiplied in a number of times equal
to the length of the offending entity; this is meant to
“encourage” the entity to shrink.7 For example, say
we have a document with three entities, Rotor Vol-
gograd twice, once labeled as PER and once as ORG,
and Rotor, labeled as an ORG. The likelihood of a
PER also being an ORG is 5

The last constraint attempts to consistently label the

In our experiments we compare the impact of adding
the non-local models with Gibbs sampling to our
baseline CRF implementation. In the CoNLL named
entity recognition task, the non-local models in-
crease the F1 accuracy by about 1.3%. Although
such gains may appear modest, note that they are
achieved relative to a near state-of-the-art NER sys-
tem: the winner of the CoNLL English task reported
an F1 score of 88.76. In contrast, the increases pub-
lished by Bunescu and Mooney (2004) are relative
to a baseline system which scores only 80.9% on
the same task. Our performance is similar on the
CMU Seminar Announcements dataset. We show
the per-field F1 results that were reported by Sutton
and McCallum (2004) for comparison, and note that
we are again achieving gains against a more compet-
itive baseline system.
For all experiments involving Gibbs sampling, we
used a linear cooling schedule. For the CoNLL
dataset we collected 200 samples per trial, and for
the CMU Seminar Announcements we collected 100
samples. We report the average of all trials, and in all
cases we outperform the baseline with greater than
95% confidence, using the standard t-test. The trials
had low standard deviations - 0.083% and 0.007% -
and high minimun F-scores - 86.72%, and 92.28%

The biggest drawback to our model is the com-
putational cost. Taking 100 samples dramatically
increases test time. Averaged over 3 runs on both
Viterbi and Gibbs, CoNLL testing time increased
from 55 to 1738 seconds, and CMU Seminar An-
nouncements testing time increases from 189 to

Several authors have successfully incorporated a
label consistency constraint into probabilistic se-
quence model named entity recognition systems.
Mikheev et al. (1999) and Finkel et al. (2004) in-
corporate label consistency information by using ad-
hoc multi-stage labeling procedures that are effec-
tive but special-purpose. Malouf (2002) and Curran
and Clark (2003) condition the label of a token at
a particular position on the label of the most recent
previous instance of that same token in a prior sen-
tence of the same document. Note that this violates
the Markov property, but is achieved by slightly re-
laxing the requirement of exact inference. Instead
of finding the maximum likelihood sequence over
the entire document, they classify one sentence at a
time, allowing them to condition on the maximum
likelihood sequence of previous sentences. This ap-
proach is quite effective for enforcing label consis-
tency in many NLP tasks, however, it permits a for-
ward flow of information only, which is not suffi-
cient for all cases of interest. Chieu and Ng (2002)
propose a solution to this problem: for each to-
ken, they define additional features taken from other
occurrences of the same token in the document.
This approach has the added advantage of allowing
the training procedure to automatically learn good
weightings for these “global” features relative to the
local ones. However, this approach cannot easily
be extended to incorporate other types of non-local
structure.
The most relevant prior works are Bunescu and
Mooney (2004), who use a Relational Markov Net-
work (RMN) (Taskar et al., 2002) to explicitly mod-
els long-distance dependencies, and Sutton and Mc-
Callum (2004), who introduce skip-chain CRFs,
which maintain the underlying CRF sequence model
(which (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) lack) while
adding skip edges between distant nodes. Unfortu-
nately, in the RMN model, the dependencies must
be defined in the model structure before doing any
inference, and so the authors use crude heuristic
part-of-speech patterns, and then add dependencies
between these text spans using clique templates.
This generates a extremely large number of over-
lapping candidate entities, which then necessitates
additional templates to enforce the constraint that
text subsequences cannot both be different entities,
something that is more naturally modeled by a CRF.
Another disadvantage of this approach is that it uses
loopy beliefpropagation and a voted perceptron for
approximate learning and inference – ill-founded
and inherently unstable algorithms which are noted
by the authors to have caused convergence prob-
lems. In the skip-chain CRFs model, the decision
of which nodes to connect is also made heuristi-
cally, and because the authors focus on named entity
recognition, they chose to connect all pairs of identi-
cal capitalized words. They also utilize loopy belief
propagation for approximate learning and inference.
While the technique we propose is similar math-
ematically and in spirit to the above approaches, it
differs in some important ways. Our model is im-
plemented by adding additional constraints into the
model at inference time, and does not require the
preprocessing step necessary in the two previously
mentioned works. This allows for a broader class of
long-distance dependencies, because we do not need
to make any initial assumptions about which nodes
should be connected, and is helpful when you wish
to model relationships between nodes which are the
same class, but may not be similar in any other way.
For instance, in the CMU Seminar Announcements
dataset, we can normalize all entities labeled as a
start time and penalize the model if multiple, non-
consistent times are labeled. This type of constraint
cannot be modeled in an RMN or a skip-CRF, be-
cause it requires the knowledge that both entities are
given the same class label.
We also allow dependencies between multi-word
phrases, and not just single words. Additionally,
our model can be applied on top of a pre-existing
trained sequence model. As such, our method does
not require complex training procedures, and can

instead leverage all of the established methods for
training high accuracy sequence models. It can in-
deed be used in conjunction with any statistical hid-
den state sequence model: HMMs, CMMs, CRFs, or
even heuristic models. Third, our technique employs
Gibbs sampling for approximate inference, a simple
and probabilistically well-founded algorithm. As a
consequence of these differences, our approach is
easier to understand, implement, and adapt to new
applications.

We have shown that a constraint model can be effec-
tively combined with an existing sequence model in
a factored architecture to successfully impose var-
ious sorts of long distance constraints. Our model
generalizes naturally to other statistical models and
other tasks. In particular, it could in the future
be applied to statistical parsing. Statistical context
free grammars provide another example of statistical
models which are restricted to limiting local struc-
ture, and which could benefit from modeling non-
local structure.

Statistical hidden state sequence models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Leek, 1997; Freitag and McCallum, 1999), Conditional Markov Models (CMMs) (Borthwick, 1999), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) are a prominent recent approach to information extraction tasks.

A general method for solving this problem is to relax the requirement of exact inference, substituting approximate inference algorithms instead, thereby permitting tractable inference in models with non-local structure. One such algorithm is Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo algorithm that is appropriate for inference in any factored probabilistic model, including sequence models and probabilistic context free grammars (Geman and Geman, 1984).

With such a model M we should be able to compute the conditional probability PM(s|o) of any state sequence s = {s0, ... , sN} given some observed input sequence o = {o0, ... , oN}. One can then sample sequences from the conditional distribution defined by the model. These samples are likely to be in high probability areas, increasing our chances of finding the maximum. The challenge is how to sample sequences efficiently from the conditional distribution defined by the model. Gibbs sampling provides a clever solution (Geman and Geman, 1984). Gibbs sampling defines a Markov chain in the space of possible variable assignments (in this case, hidden state sequences) such that the stationary distribution of the Markov chain is the joint distribution over the variables. Thus it is called a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method; see Andrieu et al. (2003) for a good MCMC tutorial. In practical terms, this means that we can walk the Markov chain, occasionally outputting samples, and that these samples are guaranteed to be drawn from the target distribution. Furthermore, the chain is defined in very simple terms: from each state sequence</context>

However, we cannot just transition greedily to higher probability sequences at each step, because the space is extremely non-convex. We can, however, borrow a technique from the study of non-convex optimization and use simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983). Geman and Geman (1984) show that it is easy to modify a Gibbs Markov chain to do annealing; at time t we replace the distribution in (1) with PA(s(t)|s(t−1)) = PM(s(t) i|s(t−1) −i , o)1/ct (2) Ej PM(s�t)|s(t� 1),o)1/ct where c = {c0, ... , cT} defines a cooling schedule.

This annealing technique has been shown to be an effective technique for stochastic optimization (Laarhoven and Arts, 1987). To verify the effectiveness of Gibbs sampling and simulated annealing as an inference technique for hidden state sequence models, we compare Gibbs and Viterbi inference methods for a basic CRF, without the addition of any non-local model. The results, given in Table 1, show that if the Gibbs sampler is run long enough, its accuracy is the same as a Viterbi decoder. 3 A Conditional Random Field Model Our basic CRF model follows that of Lafferty et al. (2001). We choose a CRF because it represents the state of the art in sequence modeling, allowing both discriminative training and the bi-directional flow of probabilistic information across the sequence. A CRF is a conditional sequence model which represents the probability of a hidden state sequence given some observations.

Although this is the only tractable method for exact computation, there are other methods for computing an approximate solution. Monte Carlo methods are a simple and effective class of methods for approximate inference based on sampling. Imagine we have a hidden state sequence model which defines a probability distribution over state sequences conditioned on any given input.

At inference time, we then sample from the Markov chain defined by this transition probability. 5.2 CMU Seminar Announcements Consistency Model Due to the lack of a development set, our consistency model for the CMU Seminar Announcements is much simpler than the CoNLL model, the numbers where selected due to our intuitions, and we did not spend much time hand optimizing the model. Specifically, we had three constraints. The first is that all entities labeled as start time are normalized, and are penalized if they are inconsistent. The second is a corresponding constraint for e</context>

In the CoNLL named entity recognition task, the non-local models increase the F1 accuracy by about 1.3%. Although such gains may appear modest, note that they are achieved relative to a near state-of-the-art NER system: the winner of the CoNLL English task reported an F1 score of 88.76. In contrast, the increases published by Bunescu and Mooney (2004) are relative to a baseline system which scores only 80.9% on the same task. Our performance is similar on the CMU Seminar Announcements dataset. We show the per-field F1 results that were reported by Sutton and McCallum (2004) for comparison, and note that we are again achieving gains against a more competitive baseline system. For all experiments involving Gibbs sampling, we used a linear cooling schedule. For the CoNLL dataset we collected 200 samples per trial, and for the CMU Seminar Announcements we collected 100 samples. We report the average of all trials, and in all cases we outperform the baseline with greater than 95% confidence, using the standard t-test. The trials had low standard deviations - 0.083% and 0.007% - and high minimun F-scores - 86.72%, and 92.28% 368 - for the CoNLL and CMU Seminar Announc</context>

This approach has the added advantage of allowing the training procedure to automatically learn good weightings for these “global” features relative to the local ones. However, this approach cannot easily be extended to incorporate other types of non-local structure. The most relevant prior works are Bunescu and Mooney (2004), who use a Relational Markov Network (RMN) (Taskar et al., 2002) to explicitly models long-distance dependencies, and Sutton and McCallum (2004), who introduce skip-chain CRFs, which maintain the underlying CRF sequence model (which (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) lack) while adding skip edges between distant nodes. Unfortunately, in the RMN model, the dependencies must be defined in the model structure before doing any inference, and so the authors use crude heuristic part-of-speech patterns, and then add dependencies between these text spans using clique templates. This generates a extremely large number of overlapping candidate entities, which then necessitates additional templates to enforce the constraint that text subsequences cannot</context>
