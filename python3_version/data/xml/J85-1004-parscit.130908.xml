In 1936, Alan Turing published &amp;quot;On Computable
Numbers, With An Application to the
Entscheidungsproblem&amp;quot;. In it he introduced the world to
Turing machines. These he called simply computing
machines, and amongst them he distinguished between
&amp;quot;automatic machines&amp;quot; (deterministic Turing machines)
and &amp;quot;choice machines&amp;quot; (nondeterministic Turing
machines). For reasons that need not detain us, Turing
focused on the computable real numbers, not on the
nature and extent of the computable functions of natural
numbers. In the last two sections of the paper (plus the
appendix), Turing presents arguments for what we
would now call Turing&apos;s Thesis (relativized to comput-
able numbers). The real question at issue is &amp;quot;What are
the possible processes which can be carried out in
computing a number?&amp;quot; Turing continues:
Computing is normally done by writing certain
symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided
into squares like a child&apos;s arithmetic book. In elementary
arithmetic the two dimensional character of the paper is
sometimes used. But such a use is always avoidable, and
I think that it will be agreed that the two-dimensional
character of paper is no essential of computation. I
assume then that the computation is carried out on one-
dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares.
Turing goes on to abstract other essentials of compu-
tation from the case of a human being using pencil and
paper to compute. Thus, when he speaks (p. 136) of the
&amp;quot;behaviour of the computer&amp;quot; being determined by &amp;quot;the
symbols he is observing, and his &apos;state of mind&apos; at that
moment&amp;quot;, Turing is using the personal pronouns nonme-
taphorically. A computer is a person engaged in the act
of computing. Indeed, after completing his analysis of
the essentials of a computation by a computer, Turing
notes (p. 137): &amp;quot;We may now construct a machine to do
the work of this computer. To each state of mind of the
computer corresponds an &apos;m-configuration&apos; of the
machine. The machine scans B squares corresponding to
the B squares observed by the computer.&amp;quot; And so on in
the same vein. Turing never speaks of a computing
machine as a computer; only people are computers.
Plus ca change, plus c&apos;est la meme chose? We now do
speak quite regularly of computing machines — even
automatic computing machines — as computers. What of
people? Ever since the birth of Artificial Intelligence
(Turing&apos;s 1950 paper &amp;quot;Computing Machinery and
Intelligence&amp;quot;; the Dartmouth Conference of 1956?), the
idea has been abroad of conceiving of people on the
model of what are now thought of as the paradigm cases
of computers, that is, as computing machines. Indeed,
Zenon Pylyshyn (1984) has recently urged us to recog-
nize the &amp;quot;Computational Metaphor&amp;quot; for the Literal Truth
it embodies: human beings, along with other intelligent,
&amp;quot;really are cogitating creatures, really are computing
machines.&amp;quot;
In The Logic of Mind, R. J. Nelson, Professor (recent-
ly emeritus) of Philosophy at Case Western Reserve
University, presents a sustained, systematic argument for
this view, a view he calls &amp;quot;mechanism&amp;quot;.
This book presents a mechanist philosophy of mind. I
hold that the human mind is a system of computational or
recursive rules that are embodied in the nervous system;
that the material presence of these rules accounts for
perception, conception, speech, belief, desire, intentional
acts, and other forms of intelligence. (p. xiii)
So much counts as almost conventional wisdom. What
is striking about Nelson is his willingness to provide us
with a systematic, specific version of mechanism, along
with an equally ready ability to defend it. (With respect
to his technical credentials, I should note that Prof.
Nelson is the author (1968) of an excellent text on auto-
mata theory, Introduction to Automata. For Nelson, it is
not enough to say people are computers and that mental
processes are computational processes; one must also
specify the kind of machine or automaton a person is.
Nelson does just this.
First he must clear the ground of what he takes (as a
rule, correctly) to be confusion and misinterpretation.
This he does at the same time as he introduces the basic
automata-theoretic notions out of which his account will
be built. Thus, after telling us in his introduction what he
means by mechanism (see the quotation above), he
divides the domain of mental phenomena in two. In one
part lie the so-called representational or contentful states
and processes, together with their corresponding underly-
ing capacities. These include, centrally, the propositional
attitudes of belief and desire, together with the results of
various peripheral pattern-recognition devices. Nelson
calls such results perceptual takings, as in (say) seeing a
hat to be red. It is to such &amp;quot;mental features&amp;quot;, as he calls
them, that his theory is directed. On the other side of the
dichotomy lie &amp;quot;pure (raw) feels&amp;quot;, as of pain. These, he
claims, must be acknowledged to be outside the purview
of mechanism.
In Chapters II and III, &amp;quot;What is a Rule of Mind&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;Behavior and Structure&amp;quot;, Nelson lays out the fundamen-
tal concepts and distinctions he will work with. These

two chapters constitute a solid, if sometimes opaquely
written, introdution to and history of the theory of auto-
mata, both finite and infinite, as well as a detailed
discussion of the associated notions of nerve networks,
computer circuits, and grammars.
In Chapter IV, &amp;quot;Mechanism — Arguments Pro and
Con&amp;quot;, Nelson responds to several of the standard argu-
ments against mechanism, including those (or is it just
one) based on (as he characterizes it) &amp;quot;the now familiar
misapplication of Godel&apos;s Theorem&amp;quot;. He has in mind
here an argument (or family of arguments) that attempt
to use Godel&apos;s First and/or Second Incompleteness
Theorems to show that humans can come to know truths
of elementary arithmetic that no machine could ever
know. Nelson&apos;s treatment of this particular morass is
woefully brief and surprisingly unsophisticated, especially
in light of the large philosophical and logical literature
such arguments have both drawn upon and engendered.
(See, especially, Webb 1980.) He does a much better
job in arguing for the compatibility of (1) thoroughgoing
Laplacian determinism and (2) people actually being
nondeterministic automata. Even here, he might have
made less heavy weather of things, and at the same time
strengthened his argument, if he had noted that physical-
ism implies neither that mental types (his &amp;quot;mental
features&amp;quot;) are identical with physical types nor that
mental tokens (individual mental events and states) are
identical with physical events and states. Chapter IV
begins with a reversal of the more or less customary
hand-waving argument from analogy: &amp;quot;Digital computers
are automata and share a large body of intelligent behav-
iors with humans; hence human beings are automata.&amp;quot;
That really is the argument — and in more or less just so
many words.
Chapter V, &amp;quot;Functionalism, Behaviorism, and
Rationalism&amp;quot;, contrasts mechanism favorably with vari-
ous close neighbors. There&apos;s something almost quaint
about the respect with which Nelson treats behaviorism.
Behaviorism is a movement now almost wholly out of
fashion; but attention must be paid and Nelson&apos;s
discussion is careful and illuminating. The last part of the
chapter is devoted to a discussion of Chomsky&apos;s
(neo)rationalism; the main point is well taken and even
fairly well argued — namely, that no plausible story about
linguistic competence and universal grammar requires
tacit propositional knowledge. The most important and
interesting (albeit least clear) part of this survey of the
current scene comes at the beginning. Nelson takes great
pains to make it clear that mechanism, or at any rate his
version of it, is not functionalism; indeed, is not even a
version of functionalism. (He does recognize that there
are mechanistic versions of functionalism. For more on
this, see Block and Fodor (1972).
What then is functionalism? By functionalism, I
understand any of a family of views whose central tenet
(if such there be) is that, representational mental states
are to be identified with — or are uniquely determined by
— their [causal] roles in the lives of [normally] functioning
organisms. In particular, this identification — or determi-
nation — is spelled out in terms of the relations holding
among input (behaviorally or physiologically character-
ized), output (behaviorally or physiologically character-
ized) and other representational mental states. In fact,
Nelson does not convince me that his version of mech-
anism is not actually a version of functionalism — though
it most certainly is not the particular mechanistic func-
tionalism (the Functional State Identity Theory) that he
discusses and rejects. Most of his arguments aren&apos;t
directed against functionalism; their target is rather one
or another ill-considered mechanistic version of function-
alism. For instance, he makes much of the fact that
mental features like belief and desire are best thought of
as automata, not as automata states. Within an automa-
ta-theoretic framework, this seems just right. Correct
also is his claim that many &amp;quot;mechanistic functionalists&amp;quot;
have spoken of beliefs and desires as states. Wrong,
though, is the [implied] claim that the mentioned misi-
dentification is an essential feature of, or intrinsic to,
functionalism. Similar points could be made about many
of his animadversions regarding functionalism; but so,
too, should it be said that his caveats against particular
theses espoused by functionalists are well-founded.
While all this &amp;quot;clearing of the ground&amp;quot; has been in
progress, Nelson has smuggled in a crucial demurrer from
current orthodoxy. He rejects the identification of
humans or human minds with universal (deterministic or
nondeterministic) Turing machines, for human memory is
obviously finite. He rejects as well the view that
&amp;quot;systems of man-environment pairs&amp;quot; are universal Turing
machines. This latter idea might seem to be Turing&apos;s,
modulo the idealization of unbounded amounts of paper
in the environment. It is crucial to keep in mind, howev-
er, that Turing wasn&apos;t (primarily) interested in the nature
of mind in general. For the special idealized case that did
interest him, it was possible to mark off clearly that part
of the environment that corresponds to the tape from the
rest of the environment as well as from the &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot;
himself. For, in principle, Turing really had in mind a
one-dimensional tape, actually sectioned off into squares,
with tokens of some specified character set actually writ-
ten in the squares. Nor need there be any doubt as to
what kinds of behavior correspond to moving left or right
one square or n squares, etc. Quite apart from concern
over problems of infinitude, none of these things can be
said for the various ill-considered accounts to the effect
that human-environment systems are universal Turing
machines.
Nelson opts unambivalently for finitude; the minds of
humans are non-deterministic finite automata. But this is
not specific enough for Nelson. The heart of his account
is to be found in Chapters VI-VIII, &amp;quot;The Logic of
Acceptance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Perception&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Belief and Desire.&amp;quot; Nelson
offers us detailed automata-theoretic analyses of certain
basic mental capacities and propositional attitudes.

These include perceptually taking some object to be
such-and-such, expectation, perceptual belief, belief
more generally, and desire. Chapters IX, &amp;quot;Reference and
Truth&amp;quot;, and X, &amp;quot;Toward Meaning&amp;quot;, attempt (cautiously
and sketchily) to extend the analyses to the phenomenon
of language. In Chapter XI, Nelson returns to raw feels,
conscious experiences, and the relationship between
mind and body. (I fear that Chapter XI sounds infinitely
more interesting than it actually is.)
The basic theoretical concept is in Nelson&apos;s account is
that of a superautomaton. A superautomaton consists of
a collection of pattern recognition devices, modeled as
(nondeterministic) finite state acceptors, cascaded
together with a central executive, modeled as a [modi-
fied] &amp;quot;Moore machine&amp;quot;. A [modified] Moore machine is
a septuple T = [S, Q, 0, q0, M, N Q(F)]. Here, S is a
finite nonempty set of inputs; Q a finite nonempty set of
internal states; 0 a finite nonempty set of outputs; q0
(an initial state) a distinguished member of Q; M a tran-
sition function (Q X S Q); N an output function
(defined only on Q; so N: Q 0); Q(F), the final
states, are a finite nonempty subset of Q. Of course, in
the case of nondeterministic Moore machines, M and N
are relations, not functions.
I shall not attempt here to impart even the &amp;quot;flavor&amp;quot; of
Nelson&apos;s analyses; indeed, I went to the trouble of speci-
fying the major novel automata-theoretic feature of
Nelson&apos;s superautomaton precisely as a surrogate for any
such venture. The striking fact about Nelson&apos;s book is
simply that someone has finally put forth a detailed and
theoretically sophisticated version of mechanism. Nelson
has had the courage of his (and others&apos;) conviotions. In
particular, he has had the courage — and the requisite
technical mastery — to offer an account against which
detailed objections could be made. Nobody else can
make that claim.
