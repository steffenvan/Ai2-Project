These volumes, which I will refer to as the
CAW volume (Williams and Holt) and the
CALL volume (Cameron) are collections of
papers from two conferences—a conference
on Computers and Writing (CAW) held at
Sheffield City Polytechnic in April 1988 and
the Second National Conference on Comput-
er-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) held
at the University of Exeter in September 1987.
Out of the nine papers in the CAW volume
and the eight papers in the CALL volume,
most seem to be directed toward people in
the fields of CALL and CAW with little or
no background in computational linguistics.
However, a computational linguist reading
the books might be interested in the descrip-
tions of systems, discussions about the role
of Al and CL in CALL and CAW, and specu-
lations about the future of CALL and CAW.
Several papers address the question of the
utility of artificial intelligence and computa-
tional linguistics in CALL and CAW. Keith
Cameron, in the preface to the CALL vol-
ume, captures the prevailing attitude of most
of the authors—an attitude of incremental
progress. &amp;quot;It is my belief that if those who
research into Al are not too ambitious at the
outset, that if the task, in true Cartesian fash-
ion, is divided up into manageable modules,
eventually a system which will achieve a high
degree of efficiency will result&amp;quot; (p. x).
Following this approach, the two volumes
contain several examples of programs that
use small amounts of natural language pro-
cessing for manageable tasks. The empha-
sis is on usable systems adhering to ped-
agogical principles and, where possible, re-
flecting what is known about cognitive mod-
els of writing and second language acqui-
sition. The systems described for CALL in-
clude GENDER MENDER, which detects er-
rors in French gender based on a statistical
analysis of spelling; Venturereader, a set of
reading and vocabulary programs with a text
database that can be examined; and a Pro-
log program that uses heuristics to detect er-
rors in French negatives and clitic pronouns.
The CAW volume contains a description of
RUSKIN, a post-writing tool that analyzes
surface features of a text, such as sentence
length, and compares them to a list of user-
entered variables about the type of text and
the intended audience.
Although the two volumes describe sev-
eral interesting CALL and CAW systems,
there are ways in which they are not likely to
be completely satisfying to a computational
linguist. First, the systems described use nat-
ural language processing very conservatively,
though they apply fairly reliable technology
in creative ways. (An ambitious exception is
Yazdani&apos;s paper on the ROALD story gen-
eration program in the CAW volume.) Sec-
ond, many papers in the CALL volume are
quite elementary from a computational lin-
guistics standpoint, including introductions
to things like phrase structure rules, Prolog,
and data compression techniques for BASIC.
Third, though many of the papers address
cognitive and pedagogical issues having to
do with foreign language acquisition, foreign
language teaching, and models of writing, in
most instances, the reader interested in such
issues will probably be left wanting more. Fi-
nally, there is almost no discussion of nat-
ural language understanding incorporating
semantic components in addition to syntax
and morphology. For example, there are no
programs described that produce a semantic
representation of student input.
Even with these reservations, the books
could be interesting for a computational lin-
guist who is looking for examples of ped-
agogically sound applications of technology
for working with text databases, error de-
tection, parsing unrestricted text, etc. Several
authors addressed the future of CALL and
CAW asking what kinds of technology could

be exploited effectively in the near future,
and what kinds of systems could be built for
various kinds of users. In most cases, natural
language processing seems to be involved,
and a little bit of natural language process-
ing can go a long way toward improving the
capabilities and flexibility of CALL and CAW
systems.—Lori Levin, Center for Machine Trans-
lation, Carnegie Mellon University

In this study, three major linguistic research
areas are combined, in an attempt to arrive at
a detailed analysis of the noun phrase speci-
fier system: the Chomskyan government and
binding theory for syntax, the Montague
grammar for formal semantics, and techno-
linguistics (defined as the linguistic counter-
part of language technology) for the com-
puter implementation of both. Detailed at-
tention is being paid to the interface between
Chomskyan grammar and Montague gram-
mar. It is shown that a Montague Semantics
can be linked to a Chomskyan enriched sur-
face structure successfully, without having to
give up the principle of compositionality. The
specifier system of the noun phrase in Dutch
is analyzed in great detail, with a wealth of
distributional facts supplied. Although most
examples are given in Dutch, it is claimed
that the analysis presented here has major
implications for Universal Grammar. Finally,
it is shown that a computer implementation
based on this analysis is able to avoid well-
known problems such as combinatorial ex-
plosion and the transparency problem.—

Any science enjoys a good bout of omphalo-
skepsis now and then, and linguistics is no
exception. Hence the popularity of Geoffrey
Pullum&apos;s columns that appeared under the
heading &amp;quot;TOPIC ... COMMENT&amp;quot; in the journal
Natural Language and Linguistic Theory from
1983 to 1989. These columns weren&apos;t about
language, but rather about linguists and the
science of linguistics, and each quarterly col-
umn was eagerly anticipated, read, and dis-
cussed more than any technical article in an
academic journal. All 23 of Pullum&apos;s columns
are now published together as a book, The

seemingly invincible myth that Eskimos have
many different words for snow. Pullum be-
lieves strongly in the science of linguistics,
and never hesitates to expose, parody, mock,
or abuse anyone or anything threatening the
scientific integrity of the field. Indeed, sev-
eral of the columns in the book are grouped
under the heading &amp;quot;Unscientific behavior.&amp;quot;
In a chapter entitled &amp;quot;Trench-mouth comes
to Trumpington Street,&amp;quot; Pullum tells how
Cambridge University Press refused to pub-
lish Georgia Green&apos;s book Semantics and Syn-
tactic Regularity (after it had already been
printed) for fear that her example sentences
were libellous; for example, Sheldon kicked
Shirley was said to be defamatory of Sheldon,
whoever he might be. &amp;quot;Stalking the perfect
journal&amp;quot; sets out nine commonsense criteria
for mechanical aspects of academic journals,
which few journals actually meet—such as
printing the full postal addresses of authors.
(Computational Linguistics scores 5 out of 9.)
And &amp;quot;Punctuation and human freedom&amp;quot; takes
on copyeditors (like those at Computational
Linguistics—Hi, Lori!) who insist on making
periods and commas precede closing quota-
tion marks even when logic and truth de-
mand otherwise.
Pullum&apos;s talent at mixing wit with diatribe
and fact with fiction makes him a kind of
Garry Trudeau of linguistics. Or maybe Dave
Barry. (Can newspaper syndication be far
away?) His engaging book will delight any
linguist whose name does not appear in it.—

This book contains complete programs and
modules in Common Lisp for a variety of ar-
tificial intelligence applications—parsing,
speech recognition, neural net simulation, ex-
pert systems, and so on. They are all written
in Common Lisp, and use a portable graphics
interface (also included). They can be typed
in from the book, or (preferably!) purchased
on a disk from the author for $12. Included
is considerable discussion of how each pro-
gram works, and the theory behind each—
obviously essential for serious use of the pro-
grams. While none of the programs is exactly
a major commercial product, each is sophis-
ticated enough to be of considerable interest
to any student of Al who wants to learn by
playing with, and extending, real code. All
would make good starting points for further
projects.—G.H.
