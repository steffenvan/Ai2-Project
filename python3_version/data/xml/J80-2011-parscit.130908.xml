The paper discusses the incorporation of richer
semantic structures into the Preference Semantics sys-
tem: they are called pseudo-texts and capture some-
thing of the information expressed in one type of
frame proposed by Minsky (q.v.). However, they are
in a format, and subject to rules of inference, consist-
ent with earlier accounts of this system of language
analysis and understanding. Their use is discussed in
connection with the phenomenon of extended use:
sentences where the semantic preferences are broken.
It is argued that such situations are the norm and not
the exception in normal language use, and that a lan-
guage understanding system must give some general
treatment of them. A notion of sense projection is
proposed, leading on to an alteration of semantic for-
mulas (word sense representations) in the face of
unexpected context by drawing information from the
pseudo texts. A possible implementation is described,
based on a new semantic parser for the Preference
Semantics system, which would cope with extended
use by the methods suggested and answer questions
about the process of analysis itself. It is argued that
this would be a good context in which to place a lan-

This paper describes an implemented, prototype
system for a sophisticated, intelligent tutor for instruc-
tion in a foreign language. The system is an applica-
tion of artificial intelligence research in natural lan-
guage, but it implements several ideas that depart from
standard approaches to natural language understand-
ing. For instance, the semantic analyzer diagnoses
several kinds of comprehension problems and semantic
errors that a student might make. Some fine distinc-
tions in meaning are represented to detect misuse of
words. Not only is a model of good syntax included in
the tutor, but also a model of incorrect forms, rich
enough to pinpoint specific syntactic mistakes. Find-
ing the intended interpretation is complicated by the
likelihood of student errors. Therefore, perfect syn-
tactic form is not necessary for semantic analysis of
the student&apos;s input. The problems discussed and solu-
tions presented are closely related to the more general
problem of how to respond to a natural language input
that surpasses the computer&apos;s model of language or of
context.

Bobrow and Winograd have presented to the AT
community two descriptions of KRL (Bobrow &amp; Wino-
grad, 1977, Bobrow, Winograd et al., 1977) which
explicate both a high level AI programming language
and a theory of knowledge representation. In actual
practice, the line between these roles is necessarily
vague. As is the case with all programming languages,
commitments made to specific data formats or control
structures profoundly affect design decisions made by
the user. In KRL, there are additional commitments
to knowledge representation in the programming lan-
guage as well. While these commitments are neutrally
presented as convenient features of high level lan-
guage, their impact on the user would be far less neu-
tral. To a user who has not previously investigated
problems of knowledge representation first-hand, KRL
either suggests a particular approach or imposes that
same approach. In either case, the user is liable to be
unconscious of the continual trade-off between low
level design options and high level programming con-
venience.

This paper explores some issues which a humanlike
story system ought to encompass, but which are usual-
ly not in the main focus of narrative models since
Propp. We argue that knowledge about actions and
interactions can account not only for how stories are
constructed, but also for why some stories are more
interesting and enduring than others. We analyze a
traditional English folktale in these terms, and show
how classes of surface expressions make recoverable
the underlying structures and dependencies that
schema-based understanders comprise.

Coherence in conversations and in texts can be
partially characterized by a set of coherence relations,
motivated ultimately by the speaker&apos;s or writer&apos;s need
to be understood. In this paper, formal definitions are
given for several coherence relations, based on the
operations of an inference system; that is, the relations
between successive portions of a discourse are charac-
terized in terms of the inferences that can be drawn
from each. In analyzing a discourse, it is frequently
the case that we would recognize it as coherent, in
that it would satisfy the formal definition of some
coherence relation, if only we could assume certain
noun phrases to be coreferential. In such cases, we
will simply assume the identity of the entities referred
to, in what might be called a &amp;quot;petty conversational
implicature,&amp;quot; thereby solving the coherence and core-
ference problems simultaneously. Three examples of
different kinds of reference problems are presented.
In each, it is shown how the coherence of the dis-
course can be recognized, and how the reference prob-
lems are solved, almost as a by-product, by means of
these petty conversational implicatures.

This paper considers a number of problems in the

present a semantic interpretation for belief sentences
and show how this interpretation overcomes some of
the difficulties of alternative approaches, especially
those based on possible-world semantics. Finally, we
argue that these difficulties arise from a mistaken at-
tempt to identify the truth conditions of a sentence
with what a competent speaker knows about the

When two people talk, they focus their attention on
only a small portion of what each of them knows or
believes. Both what is said and how it is interpreted
depend on a shared understanding of this narrowing of
attention to a small highlighted portion of what is
known.
Focusing is an active process. As a dialogue prog-
resses, the participants continually shift their focus and
thus form an evolving context against which utterances
are produced and understood. A speaker provides a
hearer with clues of what to look at and how to look
at it - what to focus on, how to focus on it, and how
wide or narrow the focusing should be. As a result,
one of the effects of understanding an utterance is
that the listener becomes focused on certain entities
(both objects and relationships) from a particular per-
spective.
Focusing clues may be linguistic or they may come
from knowledge about the relationships between enti-
ties in the domain. Linguistic clues may be either
explicit, deriving directly from certain words, or im-
plicit, deriving from sentential structure and from rhet-
orical relationships between sentences.
This paper examines the relationships between fo-
cusing and definite descriptions in dialogue and its
implications for natural language processing systems.
It describes focusing mechanisms based on domain-
structure clues which have been included in a comput-
er system and, from this perspective, indicates future
research problems entailed in modeling the focusing
process more generally.

A framework is proposed for developing a portable

the identification of a key concept of the framework: a
conceptual schema for representing a user&apos;s model of
the domain as distinct from the data base schema.
The notions of conceptual completeness and linguistic
coverage are shown to be natural consequences of this
framework. An implementation of the framework,

Texts are viewed as purposeful transactions whose
interpretation requires inferences based on extra-
linguistic as well as on linguistic information. Text
processors are viewed as systems that model both a
theory of text and a theory of information processing.
The interdisciplinary research required to design such
systems has a common center, conceptually, in the
development of new kinds of lexical information, since
words are not only linguistic objects, they are also
psychological objects that evoke experiences from
which meanings can be inferred. Recent developments
in linguistic theory seem likely to promote more fruit-
ful cooperation and integration of linguistic research
with research on text processing.

This paper presents an explanatory overview of a
large and complex grammar, DIAGRAM, that is used
in a computer system for interpreting English dialogue.
126 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 2, April-June 1980
The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature
DIAGRAM analyzes all of the basic kinds of phrases
and sentence&apos;s and many quite complex ones as well.
It is not tied to a particular domain of application, and
it can be extended to analyze additional constructions,
using the formalism in which it is currently written.
For every expression it analyzes, DIAGRAM provides
an annotated description of the structural relations
holding among its constituents. The annotations pro-
vide important information for other parts of the sys-
tem that interpret the expression in the context of a
dialogue.
DIAGRAM is an augmented phrase structure gram-
mar. Its rule procedures allow phrases to inherit at-
tributes from their constituents and to acquire attrib-
utes from the larger phrases in which they themselves
are constituents. Consequently, when these attributes
are used to set context-sensitive constraints on the
acceptance of an analysis, the contextual constraints
can be imposed by conditions on dominance as well as
conditions on constituency. Rule procedures can also
assign scores to an analysis, rating some applications
of a rule as probable or as unlikely. Less likely ana-
lyses can be ignored by the procedures that interpret
the utterance.
In assigning categories and writing the rule state-
ments and procedures for DIAGRAM, decisions were
guided by consideration of the functions that phrases
serve in communication as well as by considerations of
efficiency in relating syntactic analyses to proposition-
al content. The major decisions are explained and
illustrated with examples of the rules and the analyses
they provide. Some contrasts with transformational
grammars are pointed out and problems that motivate
a plan to use redundancy rules in the future are dis-
cussed. (Redundancy rules are meta-rules that derive
new constituent-structure rules from a set of base
rules, thereby achieving generality of syntactic state-
ment without having to perform transformations on
syntactic analyses.) Other extensions of both grammar
and formalism are projected in the concluding section.
Appendices provide details and samples of the lexicon,
the rule statements, and the procedures, as well as
analyses for several sentences that differ in type and
structure.

This paper describes the results of a three-year
research effort investigating the knowledge and proc-
esses needed for participation in natural-language dia-
logs about ongoing mechanical-assembly tasks. Major
concerns were the ability to interpret and respond to
utterances within the dynamic environment effected by
progress in the task, as well as by the concomitant
shifting dialog context.
The research strategy followed was to determine
the kinds of knowledge needed, to define formalisms
for encoding them and procedures for reasoning with
them, to implement those formalisms and procedures
in a computer system called TDUS, and then to test
them by exercising the system.
Principal accomplishments include: development of
a framework for encoding knowledge about linguistic
processes; encoding of a grammar for recognizing
many of the syntactic structures of English; develop-
ment of the concept of &amp;quot;focusing,&amp;quot; which clarifies a
major role of context; development of a formalism for
representing knowledge about processes, and proce-
dures for reasoning about them; development of an
overall framework for describing how different types
of knowledge interact in the communication process;
development of a computer system that not only dem-
onstrates the feasibility of the various formalisms and
procedures, but also provides a research tool for test-
ing new hypotheses about the communication process.

This thesis concerns how people use language to
communicate. While the literal meaning and syntactic
structure of a sentence tell us what the speaker said,
often they do not capture what was actually meant.
For instance, when we hear &amp;quot;Can you pass the salt?&amp;quot;
at the dinner table, why do we take this to be a re-
quest to pass the salt rather than a query about our
salt-passing ability? The answer, in part, is that un-
derstanding what was meant requires recognizing what
the speaker intended, i.e. what he hopes to achieve.
Thus, we consider &amp;quot;Can you pass the salt?&amp;quot; to be a
request because we recognize that the speaker said it
intending to get us to pass the salt.
In addition, people often communicate using only
short phrases or even single words. For instance, were
you to walk into my office, I could request that you
close the door by simply saying &amp;quot;the door&amp;quot;.
This thesis examines the language comprehension
process using a model of goal-directed behaviour. Ut-
terances are considered to be instances of speech acts,
which are actions that can be reasoned about in a

planning system. A large part of a hearer&apos;s under-
standing of an utterance involves recognizing the plan
(of the speaker) that produced it. This plan may con-
tain obstacles, goals that the speaker cannot achieve
without assistance. The responses are formed on the
basis of these obstacles.
Speech acts are defined in terms of the plan that
the hearer believes the speaker intended him to recog-
nize. Speech act identification is then accomplished
by the plan recognition process. This method accounts
for many sentences that are not intended with their
literal meaning (the indirect speech acts). In particu-
lar, this thesis concentrates on the indirect forms of
requests and informs.
There are other linguistic phenomena that can be
explained by this model and that are considered in the
thesis. Answers that provide more information than
explicitly asked for often arise from the method of
basing responses on the obstacles in the speaker&apos;s
plan. Some sentence fragments can identify the
speaker&apos;s plan and obstacles. Thus, these can be an-
swered appropriately without ever having to construct
a syntactically complete sentence from the fragment.
This work also extends naturally to explain the genera-
tion and participation in subdialogues whose purpose is
to clarify or correct previous utterances.
Finally, it examines possible extensions to this
model. In particular, it considers the generation (the
planning) of indirect forms of speech acts and discuss-
es how this work relates to the other classes of speech
acts.

Natural dialogue does not proceed haphazardly; it
has an easily recognized &amp;quot;episodic&amp;quot; structure and co-
herence that conform to a well developed set of con-
ventions. This report represents these conventions
formally in terms related to speech act theory and to a
theory of action. The major formal unit, the Dialogue
Game, specifies aspects of the communication of both
participants in a dialogue. We define the formal no-
tion of Dialogue Games and describe some of the im-
portant Games of English. Dialogue Games are con-
ventions of interactive goal pursuit. Using them, each
participant pursues his own goal in a way that some-
times serves the goals of the other. The idea of Dia-
logue Games can thus be seen as part of a broader
theoretical perspective characterizing virtually all com-
munication as goal pursuit activity. We also define
and exemplify the property of Motivational Coherence
of dialogues. Motivational coherence can be used as
an interpretive principal in explaining language com-
prehension. Actual dialogue games have a kind of
casual connectedness that is not a consequence of
their formal properties. This is explained in terms of a
theory of action, which is also seen to explain a similar
attribute of speech acts.

For a computer program to be able to compose text
is interesting both intellectually and practically. Artifi-
cial Intelligence research has only recently begun to
address the task of creating coherent texts containing
more than one sentence.
Our recent research has produced a new paradigm
for organizing and expressing information in text.
This paradigm, called Fragment-and-Compose, has
been used in a pilot project to create texts from se-
mantic nets. The method involves dividing the given
body of information into many small propositional
units, and then combining these units into smooth
coherent text. So far the largest example written by
Fragment-and-Compose has been two paragraphs of
instruction about what a computer operator should do
in case of indications of a fire.
This report describes the text generation problem
and anticipates a specific way to disseminate and use
technical developments. It presents the research that
led to creation of Fragment-and-Compose, including
the largest example of computer-produced text. It also
discusses the immediate problems and difficulties of
elaborating Fragment-and-Compose into a general and
powerful method.

Labelling a data base management system as

the more important question for the user: How well
does it work? How much help will it give me in solv-

I want to suggest several criteria for comparison,
evaluation, and selection of natural language query
systems for use with structured data bases. The crite-
ria should also be useful in comparing natural language
systems with artificial languages in similar applications.
More importantly, I want to suggest that there are

which are capable of serving useful purposes, and that
it is perhaps best to look at them from the point of
view of the practical user, rather than from that of
someone trying to simulate the full range of human

PHLIQA1 is an experimental computer program
which answers English questions about a limited sub-
ject domain. The design of the system is based on the
distinction between different, successively &amp;quot;deeper&amp;quot;
levels of semantic analysis. At each of these levels, a
different formal language is used to express the mean-
ing of a question. The languages have the same syn-
tactic and semantic structure, but they differ in the
constants they contain. The most important represent-
ation languages are: (1) the English-oriented Formal
Language, with constants that correspond to the
&amp;quot;content words&amp;quot; of English, (2) the World Model
Language, with constants that represent the primitive
concepts that characterize the subject domain of the
system, and (3) the Data Base Language, with con-
stants that represent the &amp;quot;record types&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;attributes&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;sets&amp;quot; that constitute the data base. The system
consists of a series of modules which translate a ques-
tion from one level to the next lower level, until it
finally results in an answer. The paper describes the
overall structure of the system, the formal languages
used for semantic representation, and the translation
steps between the different levels. It also shows how
the multilevel semantics set-up makes it possible to
treat ambiguous and unanswerable questions in a care-
ful way.

An Anatomy of Graceful Interaction in Spoken

There have recently been a number of attempts to
provide natural and flexible interfaces to computer
systems through the medium of natural language.
While such interfaces typically perform well in re-
sponse to straightforward requests and questions with-
in their domain of discourse, they often fail to interact
gracefully with their users in less predictable circum-
stances. Most current systems cannot, for instance:
respond reasonably to input not conforming to a rigid
grammar; ask for and understand clarification if their
user&apos;s input is unclear; offer clarification of their own
output if the user asks for it; or interact to resolve any
ambiguities that may arise when the user attempts to
describe things to the system.
We believe that graceful interaction in these and
the many other contingencies that can arise in human
conversation is essential if interfaces are ever to ap-
pear cooperative and helpful, and hence be suitable for
the casual or naive user, and more habitable for the
experienced user. In this paper, we attempt to circum-
scribe graceful interaction as a field for study, and
identify the problems involved in achieving it.
To this end we decompose graceful interaction into
a number of relatively independent skills: skills in-
volved in parsing elliptical, fragmented, and otherwise
ungrammatical input; in ensuring robust communica-
tion; in explaining abilities and limitations, actions and
the motives behind them; in keeping track of the focus
of attention of a dialogue; in identifying things from
descriptions, even if ambiguous or unsatisfiable; and in
describing things in terms appropriate for the context.
We claim these skills are necessary for any type of
graceful interaction and sufficient for graceful interac-
tion in a certain large class of application domains.
None of these components is individually much be-
yond the current state of the art, and we outline the
architecture of a system that integrates them all.
Thus, we propose graceful interaction as an idea of
great practical utility whose time has come and which
is ripe for implementation. We are currently imple-
menting a gracefully interacting system along the lines
presented; the system will initially deal with typed
input, but is eventually intended to accept speech.

A novel implementation of the basic mechanisms of
a semantic network is presented. This constitutes a
merging, in terms of the underlying language architec-
ture, of a powerful problem-solving mechanism,
production-rule systems, with a proven representation
formalism. Details are presented on the most basic
aspects of the network, namely on representing nodes
and on mechanisms for their access. Commands for
definition, modification, and search-based displays of
network information are discussed. The relations of
the network are divided into six groups: taxonomic,
structural, functional, descriptive, means-ends, and
physical. The &amp;quot;further specification&amp;quot; relation is put
forward as an improvement over concepts such as
&amp;quot;ISA&amp;quot;, superset, instantiation, individuation, and the
type-token distinction. The importance of uniformly
representing methods and network as rules and the
importance of distinguishing temporary from perma-
nent states are discussed. Since the system is rule-
based, it includes a simple but powerful augmentation
capability, embodied in a language for expressing me-
thods. Though evidence is not provided here for ad-
vanced semantic net capabilities, there is sketched a
production system position on a number of relevant
issues for those capabilities. The domain of applica-
tion is the symbolic description and manipulation of
computer structures at the PMS (processor-memory-
switch) level. The system will ultimately be used for
computer-aided design activities.

A document retrieval system that has knowledge of
the subject matter of its data base is used to explore
the relationship between memory structures and infor-
mation retrieval processes. Six semantic relations are
used to define a semantic network model of legal
knowledge in the area of Negotiable Instruments Law.
These are: set/member relations, superclass/subclass
relations, constituent relations, property relations, role
relations, and event-condition relations. A formal
language is developed that allows the user to create
complex relational expressions describing situations of
interest to lawyers. A data base of 400 cases and
statutes is defined using this language, called the Situ-
ation Description Language (SDL), to describe the
situations that are discussed in each document.
The retrieval system accepts queries in the Situa-
tion .Description Language, and uses its knowledge of
legal relationships to determine when a SDL expres-
sion that has been entered as part of a document de-
scriptor satisfies another SDL expression that has been
entered as a query. Some logical and semantic rela-
tionships between sets of SDL expressions are ex-
plored in the context of different types of queries, and
the realization of these relationships is demonstrated.
The system is implemented in LISP on the Michigan

contraction allows graphs containing many low-level

Inferences can then be performed on any level that is

Montague (1973) translates English into an inten-
sional logic which is an extension of the typed lambda-
calculus. In this paper we consider the ways in which
Montague&apos;s Meaning Postulates can be used to justify
the introduction of extensional forms of translations.
We define a function XTOU, which replaces quantifi-
cation over individual concepts by quantification over
entities, and a function FIXEXT, which then intro-
duces extensional constants in place of the original
intensional forms of lexical items. These obtain the
forms of translations displayed in examples in PTQ.
We prove that the two functions preserve logical equi-
valence in all models satisfying the Meaning Postu-
lates.

In this paper, ideas are presented for the expression
of natural language grammars in clausal logic, follow-
ing the work of Colmerauer, Kowalski, Pereira, and
Warren. A uniform format for syntactic structures is
proposed, in which every syntactic item consists of a
central predication, a cluster of modifiers, a list of fea-
tures, and a determiner. The modifiers of a syntactic
item are again syntactic items (of the same format),
and a modifier&apos;s determiner shows its function in the
semantic structure. In the rules for syntax, the notions
of slots and slot-filling play a central role, following
previous work by the author. The Appendix contains
an example grammar and samples of parses and se-
mantic interpretations into logical form. The system is
implemented in Prolog.

An experiment is described which gives data related
to the usefulness and efficiency of English as a pro-
gramming language. The experiment was performed
with the NLC system described herein and used
twenty-three paid volunteers from a first course in
programming. The subjects were asked to solve two
problems, one on the experimental system and one
using the PL/C language studied in their course. The
subjects typed a total of 1581 English sentences, 81
percent of which were processed correctly. The re-
maining 19 percent were rejected because of question-
able user syntax or system inadequacies which are
discussed.
None of the standard concerns about natural lan-
guage programming related to vagueness, ambiguity,
verbosity, or correctness was a significant problem,
although minor difficulties did arise occasionally. The
time required to solve the problems using English was
much less than for PL/C. However, the natural lan-

The attempts to model the process of natural lan-
guage comprehension with a computer have shed some
light on the very nature of natural language itself. We
discuss here some issues concerning language process-
ing and show that any computational choice entails a
commitment about what natural language really is.
We conclude that what makes a language to be natural
is its ability to be interpreted at variable depths.

Artificial Intelligence, as well as neurophysiological
studies of recent decades, suggests a unitary view of
language, in which natural language constitutes only
part of the total language of the organism; the latter is
a single but complex structure containing also the
symbol-systems and their transformations responsible
for mental processes. Following Sloman, the dogma
that communication is the main function of language is
opposed, and implications of the unitary thesis in re-
spect to a number of linguistic and psychological ques-

The aims of this study are first to provide epistemo-
logical foundations for a scientific study of descriptive
or propositional semantics, independent of particular
theories of syntax, and then to develop certain aspects
of semantic theory to show that for a semantic theory
to be adequate, it must integrate the propositional
meanings of successive sentences together into larger
units. Such theories are called integrative, and the last
major aim is to present one such integrative semantic
theory, the C-net theory developed by the author and
J-P. Paillet, in a semi-formal fashion, and to develop
some of its implications about the lexicon. This work
shows that integrative semantics is both necessary and
possible, and it adds some detail to the structure of an
integrative semantic theory.

Quite typically in word-formation studies, and more
particularly in studies of suffixal derivation, productiv-
ity, i.e. the extent to which a suffix is or is not used to
form new derivatives, is described in qualitative rather
than quantitative terms. By using a computer, one can
group words together by suffix facilely, and then date
the derivatives using historical-etymological dictionar-
ies. So for a given time span all new derivative prod-
uctions can be obtained and counted, subject, of
course, to their datability in such dictionaries.
The some 12,000 words in the Marty-Laveaux
Glossaire were punched onto computer cards. A com-
puter program was written to reverse alphabetize the
words. The reverse dictionary thus produced con-
tained the words spelled in their normal order, but
alphabetized from the right instead of from the left.
The result was that the words were grouped together
by suffix rather than by&apos;prefix (as in a normal diction-
ary). This grouping allowed all the words in Rabelais&apos;
vocabulary with any particular suffix to be examined.
Given a list of the suffixes active in the sixteenth cen-
tury, the final, major task was to isolate those words
with these suffixes which were actually derived in the
sixteenth century, the period investigated; they had to
have been produced by the joining of a suffix to a root
in the sixteenth century, and not be merely a
sixteenth-century spelling of an already existing
French, Latin, or Greek word. To determine whether
or not a word was of sixteenth century genesis, stand-
ard dictionaries were consulted. Graphs were then
generated for the some seventy suffixes considered,
showing the number of sixteenth-century derivatives in
each of the five books.

This paper describes an implemented, prototype system for a sophisticated, intelligent tutor for instruction in a foreign language. The system is an application of artificial intelligence research in natural language, but it implements several ideas that depart from standard approaches to natural language understanding. For instance, the semantic analyzer diagnoses several kinds of comprehension problems and semantic errors that a student might make. Some fine distinctions in meaning are represented to detect misuse of words. Not only is a model of good syntax included in the tutor, but also a model of incorrect forms, rich enough to pinpoint specific syntactic mistakes. Finding the intended interpretation is complicated by the likelihood of student errors. Therefore, perfect syntactic form is not necessary for semantic analysis of the student&apos;s input. The problems discussed and solutions presented are closely related to the more general problem of how to respond to a natural language input that surpasses the computer&apos;s model of language or of context.</abstract>

Bobrow and Winograd have presented to the AT community two descriptions of KRL (Bobrow &amp; Winograd, 1977, Bobrow, Winograd et al., 1977) which explicate both a high level AI programming language and a theory of knowledge representation. In actual practice, the line between these roles is necessarily vague. As is the case with all programming languages, commitments made to specific data formats or control structures profoundly affect design decisions made by the user. In KRL, there are additional commitments to knowledge representation in the programming language as well. While these commitments are neutrally presented as convenient features of high level language, their impact on the user would be far less neutral. To a user who has not previously investigated of knowledge representation first-hand, either suggests a particular approach or imposes that same approach. In either case, the user is liable to be unconscious of the continual trade-off between low level design options and high level programming convenience.</abstract>

Coherence in conversations and in texts can be partially characterized by a set of coherence relations, motivated ultimately by the speaker&apos;s or writer&apos;s need to be understood. In this paper, formal definitions are given for several coherence relations, based on the operations of an inference system; that is, the relations between successive portions of a discourse are characterized in terms of the inferences that can be drawn from each. In analyzing a discourse, it is frequently the case that we would recognize it as coherent, in that it would satisfy the formal definition of some coherence relation, if only we could assume certain noun phrases to be coreferential. In such cases, we will simply assume the identity of the entities referred to, in what might be called a &amp;quot;petty conversational implicature,&amp;quot; thereby solving the coherence and coreference problems simultaneously. Three examples of different kinds of reference problems are presented. In each, it is shown how the coherence of the discourse can be recognized, and how the reference problems are solved, almost as a by-product, by means of these petty conversational implicatures.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.9847053125">Technical Note 185, April 1979. When two people talk, they focus their attention on only a small portion of what each of them knows or believes. Both what is said and how it is interpreted depend on a shared understanding of this narrowing of attention to a small highlighted portion of what is known. Focusing is an active process. As a dialogue progresses, the participants continually shift their focus and thus form an evolving context against which utterances are produced and understood. A speaker provides a hearer with clues of what to look at and how to look at it what to focus on, how to focus on it, and how wide or narrow the focusing should be. As a result, one of the effects of understanding an utterance is that the listener becomes focused on certain entities (both objects and relationships) from a particular perspective. Focusing clues may be linguistic or they may come from knowledge about the relationships between entities in the domain. Linguistic clues may be either explicit, deriving directly from certain words, or implicit, deriving from sentential structure and from rhetorical relationships between sentences. This paper examines the relationships between focusing and definite descriptions in dialogue and its implications for natural language processing systems. It describes focusing mechanisms based on domainstructure clues which have been included in a computer system and, from this perspective, indicates future research problems entailed in modeling the focusing process more generally.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.998507909090909">DIAGRAM analyzes all of the basic kinds of phrases and sentence&apos;s and many quite complex ones as well. It is not tied to a particular domain of application, and it can be extended to analyze additional constructions, using the formalism in which it is currently written. For every expression it analyzes, DIAGRAM provides an annotated description of the structural relations holding among its constituents. The annotations provide important information for other parts of the system that interpret the expression in the context of a dialogue. DIAGRAM is an augmented phrase structure grammar. Its rule procedures allow phrases to inherit attributes from their constituents and to acquire attributes from the larger phrases in which they themselves are constituents. Consequently, when these attributes are used to set context-sensitive constraints on the acceptance of an analysis, the contextual constraints can be imposed by conditions on dominance as well as conditions on constituency. Rule procedures can also assign scores to an analysis, rating some applications of a rule as probable or as unlikely. Less likely analyses can be ignored by the procedures that interpret the utterance. In assigning categories and writing the rule statements and procedures for DIAGRAM, decisions were guided by consideration of the functions that phrases serve in communication as well as by considerations of efficiency in relating syntactic analyses to propositional content. The major decisions are explained and illustrated with examples of the rules and the analyses they provide. Some contrasts with transformational grammars are pointed out and problems that motivate a plan to use redundancy rules in the future are discussed. (Redundancy rules are meta-rules that derive new constituent-structure rules from a set of base rules, thereby achieving generality of syntactic statement without having to perform transformations on syntactic analyses.) Other extensions of both grammar and formalism are projected in the concluding section. Appendices provide details and samples of the lexicon, the rule statements, and the procedures, as well as analyses for several sentences that differ in type and structure.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.983903137931035">Technical Note 210, March 1980. This paper describes the results of a three-year research effort investigating the knowledge and processes needed for participation in natural-language dialogs about ongoing mechanical-assembly tasks. Major concerns were the ability to interpret and respond to utterances within the dynamic environment effected by progress in the task, as well as by the concomitant shifting dialog context. The research strategy followed was to determine the kinds of knowledge needed, to define formalisms for encoding them and procedures for reasoning with them, to implement those formalisms and procedures in a computer system called TDUS, and then to test them by exercising the system. Principal accomplishments include: development of a framework for encoding knowledge about linguistic processes; encoding of a grammar for recognizing many of the syntactic structures of English; development of the concept of &amp;quot;focusing,&amp;quot; which clarifies a major role of context; development of a formalism for representing knowledge about processes, and procedures for reasoning about them; development of an overall framework for describing how different types of knowledge interact in the communication process; development of a computer system that not only demonstrates the feasibility of the various formalisms and procedures, but also provides a research tool for testing new hypotheses about the communication process.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.978499818181818">Technical Report No. 131179, Feb. 1979. This thesis concerns how people use language to communicate. While the literal meaning and syntactic structure of a sentence tell us what the speaker said, often they do not capture what was actually meant. For instance, when we hear &amp;quot;Can you pass the salt?&amp;quot; at the dinner table, why do we take this to be a request to pass the salt rather than a query about our salt-passing ability? The answer, in part, is that understanding what was meant requires recognizing what the speaker intended, i.e. what he hopes to achieve. Thus, we consider &amp;quot;Can you pass the salt?&amp;quot; to be a request because we recognize that the speaker said it intending to get us to pass the salt. In addition, people often communicate using only short phrases or even single words. For instance, were you to walk into my office, I could request that you close the door by simply saying &amp;quot;the door&amp;quot;. This thesis examines the language comprehension process using a model of goal-directed behaviour. Utterances are considered to be instances of speech acts, which are actions that can be reasoned about in a Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 2, April-June 127 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature planning system. A large part of a hearer&apos;s understanding of an utterance involves recognizing the plan (of the speaker) that produced it. This plan may conthat the speaker cannot achieve without assistance. The responses are formed on the basis of these obstacles. Speech acts are defined in terms of the plan that the hearer believes the speaker intended him to recognize. Speech act identification is then accomplished by the plan recognition process. This method accounts for many sentences that are not intended with their literal meaning (the indirect speech acts). In particular, this thesis concentrates on the indirect forms of requests and informs. There are other linguistic phenomena that can be explained by this model and that are considered in the thesis. Answers that provide more information than explicitly asked for often arise from the method of basing responses on the obstacles in the speaker&apos;s plan. Some sentence fragments can identify the speaker&apos;s plan and obstacles. Thus, these can be answered appropriately without ever having to construct a syntactically complete sentence from the fragment. This work also extends naturally to explain the generation and participation in subdialogues whose purpose is to clarify or correct previous utterances. Finally, it examines possible extensions to this model. In particular, it considers the generation (the planning) of indirect forms of speech acts and discusses how this work relates to the other classes of speech acts.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.986070291666667">Natural dialogue does not proceed haphazardly; it has an easily recognized &amp;quot;episodic&amp;quot; structure and coherence that conform to a well developed set of conventions. This report represents these conventions formally in terms related to speech act theory and to a theory of action. The major formal unit, the Dialogue Game, specifies aspects of the communication of both participants in a dialogue. We define the formal notion of Dialogue Games and describe some of the important Games of English. Dialogue Games are conventions of interactive goal pursuit. Using them, each participant pursues his own goal in a way that sometimes serves the goals of the other. The idea of Dialogue Games can thus be seen as part of a broader theoretical perspective characterizing virtually all communication as goal pursuit activity. We also define and exemplify the property of Motivational Coherence of dialogues. Motivational coherence can be used as an interpretive principal in explaining language comprehension. Actual dialogue games have a kind of casual connectedness that is not a consequence of their formal properties. This is explained in terms of a theory of action, which is also seen to explain a similar attribute of speech acts.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.987412333333333">For a computer program to be able to compose text is interesting both intellectually and practically. Artificial Intelligence research has only recently begun to address the task of creating coherent texts containing more than one sentence. Our recent research has produced a new paradigm for organizing and expressing information in text. This paradigm, called Fragment-and-Compose, has been used in a pilot project to create texts from semantic nets. The method involves dividing the given body of information into many small propositional units, and then combining these units into smooth coherent text. So far the largest example written by Fragment-and-Compose has been two paragraphs of instruction about what a computer operator should do in case of indications of a fire. This report describes the text generation problem and anticipates a specific way to disseminate and use technical developments. It presents the research that led to creation of Fragment-and-Compose, including the largest example of computer-produced text. It also discusses the immediate problems and difficulties of elaborating Fragment-and-Compose into a general and powerful method.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.9811559">HAM-RPM Report No. 11, March 1979, (In German). This paper discusses adaptations of the ATN formalism for semantic and pragmatic processing in natural language understanding and generation. First, the various uses of ATNs are classified and a set of definitions of terms like &apos;semantically guided parsing&apos;, &apos;semantic grammar&apos; and &apos;pragmatic grammar&apos; is proposed. The use of ATNs for semantic and pragmatic Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 2, April-June 1980 The FINITE STRING Newsletter Abstracts of Current Literature processing is investigated by discussing the generation of definite noun phrases. It is shown that when we try to describe the generation of noun phrases as a cognitive process whose results enable the listener to identify an object intended by the speaker as it is done in the dialogue system HAM-RPM we are confronted with several limitations of the ATN formalism. Finally, ten critical theses are formulated which summarize the strengths and limitations of ATNs within the framework of semantic and pragmatic processing.</abstract>
