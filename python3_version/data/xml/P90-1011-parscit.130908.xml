A crucially important adequacy test of any the-
ory of speech acts is its ability to handle perfor-
matives. This paper provides a theory of perfor-
matives as a test case for our rationally based the-
ory of illocutionary acts. We show why &amp;quot;I request
you. is a request, and &amp;quot;I lie to you that p&amp;quot; is
self-defeating. The analysis supports and extends
earlier work of theorists such as Bach and Harnish
[1] and takes issue with recent claims by Searle [10]
that such performative-as-declarative analyses are
doomed to failure.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995225">
There is something special about performative
sentences, sentences such as &amp;quot;I promise to return&amp;quot;:
uttering them makes them true. How and when
is this possible? Not all verbs can be uttered in
the first-person present tense and thereby make
the sentence true. In general, the successful verbs
seem to correspond to those naming illocution-
ary acts, but not to perlocutionary ones such as
&amp;quot;frighten.&amp;quot; But, even some illocutionary verbs
cannot be used performatively: e.g., &amp;quot;I lie to you
that I didn&apos;t steal your watch&amp;quot; is self-defeating
[12]. So, which verbs can be use performatively,
and in Searle&apos;s words [10], &amp;quot;how do performatives
work?&amp;quot;
Any theory of illocutionary acts needs to pro-
vide a solution to questions such as these. But,
such questions are not merely of theoretical in-
terest. Natural language database question-
answering systems have been known to receive
performative utterances [14], dialogue systems
that recognize illocutionary acts (e.g., [6]) will
need to infer the correct illocutionary force to
function properly, dialogue translation systems [5]
will have to cope with markers of illocutionary

force that function performatively (e.g., sentence
final particles in Japanese), and proposals for
&amp;quot;agent-oriented programming languages&amp;quot; [7, 13],
as well as Winograd and Flores&apos; [15] COORDINA-
TOR system, are based on performative communi-
cation. For all these systems, it is important to
understand the semantics and pragmatics of such
communicative acts, especially their intended ef-
fects. To do so, one needs a full theory of il-
locutionary acts, and a format theory that pre-
dicts how utterances can be made true by uttering
them.
The currently accepted theory of performatives
is that they are in fact assertions, hence true or
false, and additionally constitute the performance
of the named illocutionary act, in the same way
as an indirect reading of an illocutionary act is
obtained from the direct illocutionary act. That
is, the named illocutionary act is derived from the
assertion as an indirect speech act. The most com-
pelling defense of this performative-as-assertion
analysis that we are aware is that of Bach and Hat-
nish [1], who address many of the linguistic phe-
nomena discussed by Sadock [9], but who, we be-
lieve, have misa,nalyzed indirect speech acts. How-
ever, in a recent paper, Searle [10] forcefully crit-
icizes the performative-as-assertion approach on
the following grounds:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9972902">
• Assertions commit the speaker to the truth
of what is asserted
• Performative statements are self-referential
• &amp;quot;An essential feature of any illocutionary act
is the intention to perform that act&amp;quot;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995825862068966">
Searle claims that accounts based on self-
referential assertions are &amp;quot;doomed to failure&amp;quot; be-
cause one cannot show that being committed to
having the intention to be performing the named
illocutionary act entails that one in fact has that
intention. Moreover, he questions that one should
derive the named illocutionary act from an asser-
tion, rather than vice-versa, However, Searle has
imparted into Bach and Harnish&apos;s theory his no-
tion of assertions as commitments to the truth
without providing a precise analysis of commit-
ment. What may be doomed to failure is any at-
tempt to base an analysis of performatives on such
a theory of assertions.
This paper provides a formal analysis of per-
formatives that treats them as declarative utter-
ances, not initially as assertions, does not succumb
to Searle&apos;s criticisms, and does not require an en-
tirely new class of illocutionary acts (the &amp;quot;dec-
larations&amp;quot;) as Searle and Vanderveken [121 have
proposed. The analysis is offered as another ade-
quacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts.
That theory, more fully explicated in [3], is based
on an analysis of the individual rational balance
agents maintain among their beliefs, goals, inten-
tions, commitments, and actions [2].
As desiderata for the theory of performatives,
we demonstrate that the analysis meets two prop-
erties:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999212">
• A sincere utterance of &amp;quot;I request you to open
the door&amp;quot; is both a request and an assertion,
yet neither illocutionary act characterization
is derived from the other.
• &amp;quot;I lie that the door is open&amp;quot; is self-defeating.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919">
Briefly, the ability to capture performatives is
met almost entirely because such utterances are
treated as indicative mood utterances, and be-
cause illocutionary acts are defined as attempts.
Since attempts depend on the speaker&apos;s beliefs and
goals, and these mental states are introspect able
in our theory if a speaker sincerely says, for ex-
ample, &amp;quot;I request you to open the door,&amp;quot; he must
believe he did the act with the requisite beliefs and
goals. Hence, the utterance is a request.
To meet the desiderata we need first to present,
albeit briefly, the theory of rational interaction,
the treatment of declarative mood utterances, and
then the illocutionary act definitions for request-
ing and asserting. Finally, we combine the vari-
ous analyses natural language processor&apos;s task by
making explicit the intended word sense of the ac-
tion, and by reducing the combinatorics inherent
in determining the attachment of the prepositional
phrases.

2 Abbreviated theory of rational
action
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976298">
Below, we give an abbreviated description of the
theory of rational action upon which we erect a
theory of intention. The theory is cast in a modal
logic of belief, goal, action, and time. Further de-
tails of this logic can be found in [2].

2.1 Syntax
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.922242212121212">
The language we use has the usual connectives of a
first-order language with equality, as well as opera-
tors for the propositional attitudes and for talking
about sequences of events: (BEL x p) and (GOAL x
p) say that p follows from x&apos;s beliefs or goals (a.k.a
choices) respectively; (AGT x e) says that x is the
only agent for the sequence of events e; el Ce2 says
that el is an initial subsequence of e2; and finally,
(HAPPENS a) and (DONE a) say that a sequence
of events describable by an action expression a will
happen next or has just happened, respectively.
Versions of HAPPENS and DONE specifying the
agent (x) are also defined.
An action expression here is built from variables
ranging over sequences of events using the con-
structs of dynamic logic [LI]: a:b is action composi-
tion; alb is nondeterministic choice; alib is concur-
rent occurrence of a and b; p7 is a test action; and
finally, a1 is repetition. The usual programming
constructs such as IF/THEN actions and WHILE
loops, can easily be formed from these. Because
test actions occur frequently in our analysis, yet
create considerable confusion, read p?;a as &amp;quot;action
a occurring when p holds,&amp;quot; and for a;p?, read &amp;quot;ac-
tion a occurs after which p holds.&amp;quot; We use e as
a variable ranging over sequences of events, and a
and b for action expressions.
We adopt the following abbreviations and do-
main predicates.
(BEFORE a p) tf (DONE p?;2)1
(AFTER a p) dAE (HAPPENS a;p?)
Op tf 3e (HAPPENS e;p?).
(LATER p) df A Op.

of words, is a declarative.

spect to some event sequence e (which we will say
has just been done.)

to thing x with respect to event e.
(FULFILL-CONDS s e e&apos;) means that event e ful-
fills the satisfaction conditions, relative to event
e&apos;, that are imposed by sentence 5.3 For example,
ifs is &amp;quot;wash the floor,&amp;quot; e would be a floor-washing
event.

The model we are developing embodies various as-

First, BEL has a &amp;quot;weak S5&amp;quot; semantics, and GOAL
has a &amp;quot;system K&amp;quot; semantics.4 Among the remain-

To capture one grade of commitment that an agent
might have toward his goals, we define a persistent
goal, P-GOAL, to be one that the agent will not

chooses that it be true later, and knows that before
abandoning that choice, he must either believe it
is true, believe it never will be true, or believe q,

etc.) is false.
Intention is a species of persistent goal. We
analyze two kinds of intentions, those to do ac-
tions and those to achieve propositions. Accord-
ingly, we define INTEND] and INTEND2 to take
action expressions and propositions as arguments,
respectively.

Intending to do an action a or achieve a proposi-
tion p is a special kind of commitment (i.e., per-
sistent goal) to having done the action a or having
achieved p.6 However, it is not a simple commit-
ment to having done a or e;p? for that would al-
low the agent to be committed to doing something
accidentally or unknowingly. Instead, we require
that the agent be committed to arriving at a state
in which he believes he is about to do the intended
action next.
This completes a brief discussion of the founda-
tional theory of intention and commitment. Next,
we proceed to define the more specific concepts
needed for analyzing communicative action.

4 Utterance Events
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991891769230769">
We begin the analysis of utterance events by
adopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance&apos;s
features (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-final
particles in Japanese) with the speaker&apos;s mental
state, termed a &amp;quot;core attitude&amp;quot; in [3, 8]. Very
roughly, a declarative utterance s will be corre-
lated with the speaker&apos;s believing the uttered sen-
tence is true, and an imperative utterance will
be correlated with the speaker&apos;s wanting the ad-
dressee to do some action that fulfills the condi-
tions imposed by the sentence. Let us notate these
correlations as
DECLARATIVE (BEL x (TRUE s e))

(FULFILL-CONDS s e&apos; e)
We formalize this notation below.
Someone who thinks he is observing an utter-
ance event will come to believe the speaker is in
the correlated mental state, unless he has other
beliefs to the contrary. For example, if the ob-
server thinks the speaker is lying, he believes that
the speaker does not believe the uttered sentence
is true. But, because he may think the speaker
takes himself to be especially convincing, the ob-
server may still believe that the speaker thinks the
observer is deceived. Hence, he would believe the

<bodyText confidence="0.999774692307692">
speaker thinks that he thinks the speaker believes
P.
This type of reasoning can continue to further
levels. In general, if an utterance is produced
when there are no countervailing observer beliefs
at a certain level of nesting, then the result will
be, at the given level of nesting, that the speaker
is taken to be in the correlated mental state [8].
To be able to state such conditions, we need to
be able to refer easily to what a person x believes
about what y believes about what x believes etc.,
to arbitrary depths. To do so, we use the notion
of ABEL.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.805651">
Definition 3 (ABEL n x y p) dt-f
(BEL x (BEL y (BEL x ...(BEL x p ) ...)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.961281363636364">
That is, ABEL characterises the nth alternating
belief between x and y that p, built up &amp;quot;from out-
side in,&amp;quot; i.e, starting with x&apos;s belief that p. On
this basis, one can define unilateral mutual belief
— what one agent believes is mutually believed —
as follows.
Definition 4 (BMB x y p) Vn(ABEL n x y p)
In other words, (BMB x y p) is the infinite conjunc-
tion (BEL x p) A (BEL x (BEL y p)) A ... Finally,
we define mutual belief and mutual knowledge as
follows.

(MK x y p) p A (MB x y p).

<bodyText confidence="0.9991975">
Utterance events can produce effects at any (or
no) level of alternating belief. For example, the
speaker may not be trying to communicate any-
thing to an intended observer. Illocutionary acts
will be defined to require that the speaker intend
to produce BM Be. In what follows, it is important
to keep in mind the distinction between utterance
events and full-blooded communicative acts.

We now provide a formal notation for this corre-
lation of utterance form and the speaker&apos;s mental
state as a kind of default axiom (cf. [8]). First, we
specify who is speaking (spkr), who is observing
(ohs, which includes the speaker and addressee,
but also others), who is being addressed (addr),
and what kind of sentence (s) has been spoken
(indicated by III). We shall assume that everyone
knows that a given utterance is of a given syn-
tactic type (e.g., declarative), that speakers and
addressees are observers, and that observers are
known by all to be observing.7

That is, #. a is an abbreviation for a quan-
tified implication roughly to the effect that if an
observer obs knows that e was just done, where
e was an uttering to addressee addr of a sentence
s in syntactic mood clb, and obs does not believe
that e was done when the speaker did not want the
addressee to come to know that the core speaker-
attitude a associated with utterances of that type
held, then ohs believes that the speaker in fact
wanted the addressee to know that a, and so he,
the observer, believes that a held just prior to
the utterance. The notation states that at each
level of alternating belief for which the antecedent
holds, so does the consequent. The symbol
can now be understood as a textual-replacement
&amp;quot;macro&amp;quot; operator.
Since these correlations are of the form

As we quantify over the positive integers indicat-
ing levels of alternative belief, we can derive the
conclusion that under certain circumstances, addr
thinks it is mutually believed (in our notation,
BM B&apos;ed) that the speaker spkr wants addr to know
a was true.
Notice that right after the utterance, we are
concerned with what mental state the observer
thinks the speaker chose to bring about in the ob-
server with that utterance. That is, the condition
on utterance events involves the speaker&apos;s wanting
to get the observer to know something, Without
this temporal dimension, our performative analy-
sis would fail. The analysis of performatives will
say that after having uttered such a sentence, or
while uttering it, the speaker believes he has just
done or is doing the named illocutionary act. Typ-
ically, prior to uttering a performative, the speaker
has not just performed that speech act, and so he
would believe his having just done so is false. So, if
the condition on utterance events in Domain -Ax-
iom 1A involved only what the speaker believed
or wanted to be true prior to the utterance, rather
than after, all performatives would fail to achieve
the observer&apos;s coming to believe anything.
We can now state the correlation between ut-
terance form and a speaker&apos;s mental state as a
domain axiom.

Searle [11] points out that an essential condition
for requesting is that the speaker be attempting to
get the addressee to perform the requested action.
We take this observation one step further and de-
fine all illocutionary acts as attempts, hence de-
fined in terms of the speaker&apos;s mental states. At-
tempts involve both types of goal states, GOAL
(merely chosen) and INTEND (chosen with com-
mitment), as noted below.

That is, an attempt to achieve q via p is a complex
action expression in which x is the agent of event e
at time t1, and prior to e the agent believes p and
q are both false, chooses that q should eventually
be true, and intends, relative to that choice, that e
should produce p. So, q represents some ultimate
goal that may or may not be achieved by the at-
tempt, while p represents what it takes to make
an honest effort.

To characterize a request or, for that matter, any
illocutionary action, we must decide on the appro-

acts to be those in which the speaker is committed
to understanding, that is, to achieving a state of
BM B that he is in a certain mental state. Below is

in. Although he is committed to that, what the
speaker has chosen to achieve is not merely to
make public his goal that the addressee know what
mental state he was in, but to make public that
he was in fact in that state of believing p. For
an INFORM, the speaker would choose to achieve
(KNOW addr p).

6 Performatives

To illustrate how performatives work, we show
when both assertions and requests can be derived
from the utterance of the performative &amp;quot;I request
you to &lt;do act&gt;.&amp;quot; The important point to notice
here is that we have not had to add to our ma-
chinery; performative utterances will be treated
exactly as declarative utterances, with the excep-
tion that the content of the utterance will make

That is, if event e is happening and the sentence s
is a present tense declarative sentence whose main
verb is &amp;quot;request,&amp;quot; whose subject x refers to per-
son x, and whose direct object y refers to person
y, then the sentence is true if x is requesting the
addressee y to fulfill the conditions of imperative
sentence s&apos;. A bare present (or present progres-
sive) tense sentence is true when the event being
described is contemporaneous with the event of
uttering it.8 This definition applies equally well
to &amp;quot;John requests Mary to ...&amp;quot; as it does when I
utter &amp;quot;I request you to ...&amp;quot; For the former, such
sentences are likely to be narrations of ongoing
events.9 For the latter, the event that is happen-
ing that makes the utterance true is the speaker&apos;s
uttering of the sentence.
By our definition of request, for x to request
y to achieve p, x has to attempt to get y to do
some action intentionally to fulfill the sentence s&apos;,
by making that goal mutually believed between
them. Thus, to say x requested y to do something
is only to say that x had the right beliefs, goals,
and intentions.

Proof sketch: Essentially, one invokes the do-
main axiom for declaratives at the first level of
ABEL, entailing that the speaker believes that he
believes that he has just done a REQUEST. Then,
one expands the definition of REQUEST into an
ATTEMPT, and then into its parts. The defini-
tion of ATTEMPT is based on BEL, GOAL and
INTEND, the first two of which are obviously in-
trospectable. That is, if one believes one has them
one does, and vice-versa. Hence, by the memory
assumption, the speaker actually had them prior
to the utterance. More critically, intending to act
at time t1 is also introspectable at time t1 because
agents know what they are doing at the next in-
stant and because there is no time to drop their
commitment [2]. Thus, one can repackage these
mental states up into an ATTEMPT and then a
REQUEST.

We have shown that the speaker of a sincere per-
formative utterance containing an illocutionary
verb has performed the illocutionary act named by
that verb. Under somewhat stronger conditions,
we can also prove that the speaker has made an
assertion. As before, let s be &amp;quot;I request you to

This default condition says that before the ut-
terance, the speaker believed there would be no
addressee belief after the utterance event (at any
level n) to the effect that prior to that event the
speaker did not want the addressee to come to
know that the speaker believed (TRUE s e). Given
Domain Axiom 1A, and the fact that BEL entails
GOAL, this suffices to entail the definition of asser-
tion. Notice that whereas requesting was derived
in virtue of the content of the utterance, an asser-
tion was derived by default assumptions regarding
lack of belief in the speaker&apos;s insincerity.

such verbs naming covert acts cannot be perfor-

speaker believes the propositional content is false.
For &amp;quot;I lie to you that the door is open&amp;quot; to be
a successful performative utterance, it would have
to be true that the utterance is a lie. We would
have to show that the uttering of that declarative
sentence results in a lie&apos;s having been done. More
generally, we provide a putative statement of the

That is, if s and s are declarative sentences of

Proof Sketch: Assume that it is mutually be-
lieved that the speaker has uttered declarative
sentence s. Now, apply Domain Axiom 1A. By
assumption, the first conjuct of the antecddent
holds. There are then two cases to consider. First,
assume (**) the second conjunct holds (say, at
level n = 1), i.e., the addressee does not believe
the speaker did not want him to know that he be-
lieved s&apos; was true. In virtue of the supposed truth
conditions on lying, spkr would have to have been
lying. By expanding its definition, and using the
memory and introspectability properties of BEL,
GOAL, and INTEND the addressee can conclude
that, before the utterance, the speaker wanted him
not to know that the speaker believes that in ut-
tering 5, he was lying. But, this contradicts the
assumption (**). Since the speaker in fact uttered
the sentence, that assumption is false, and the ad-
dressee believes the speaker did not in fact want
him to know that he believed the sentence was
true. This renders impossible the intentions to be
achieved in asserting, which are constitutive of ly-
ing as well.
Now, assume (&amp;quot;) is false, so the addressee in
fact believes the speaker did not want him to know
that s&apos; was true. Again, this immediately makes
the speaker&apos;s intentions in asserting, and hence ly-
ing, impossible to achieve. So, in neither case is
the utterance a lie. If the addressee believes the
speaker is a competent speaker of the language,
the speaker must have intended some other inter-
pretation.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998024">
Requesting works well as a performative verb be-
cause requesting requires only that the agent has
made an attempt, and need not have succeeded in
getting the hearer to do the requested action, or
even to form the right beliefs. Some verbs can-
not be used performatively, such as &amp;quot;frighten,&amp;quot;
because they require something beyond a mere
attempt. Renee, such verbs would name action
expressions that required a particular proposition
p be true after the utterance event. When the ut-
terance event does not guarantee such a p, the use
of the performative verb will not be possible.
On the other hand, certain utterances (perfor-
mative or not), when performed by the right peo-
ple in the right circumstances, make certain insti-
tutional facts hold. So, when a clergyman, judge,
or ship captain says &amp;quot;I now pronounce you hus-
band and wife,&amp;quot; the man and woman in question
are married. In our framework, there would be a
domain axiom whose antecedent characterizes the
circumstances, participants, and nature of the ut-
terance event, and whose consequent asserts that
an institutional fact is true. The axiom is justified
not by the nature of rational action, but by the ex-
istence of an institution. Such utterances could be

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931875">
made with a performative prefix provided such at-
tempts are made into successes by the institution.
This paper has shown that treating performa-
tive utterances as declarative sentences is a vi-
able analysis, in spite of Searle&apos;s criticisms. The
performative use of an illocutionary verb is self-
guaranteeing when the named illocutionary act
consists in the speaker&apos;s making an attempt to
make public his mental state. In such casts, if
the speaker thinks he has done so, then he has.
However, we do not derive the named illocution-
ary act from the assertion, nor vice-versa. Instead,
both derivations may be made from the utterance
event, but the assertive one is in fact harder to
obtain as it has extra conditions that need to be
satisfied.

<abstract confidence="0.997050356382981">A crucially important adequacy test of any theory of speech acts is its ability to handle performatives. This paper provides a theory of performatives as a test case for our rationally based theory of illocutionary acts. We show why &amp;quot;I request you. is a request, and &amp;quot;I lie to you that p&amp;quot; is self-defeating. The analysis supports and extends earlier work of theorists such as Bach and Harnish [1] and takes issue with recent claims by Searle [10] that such performative-as-declarative analyses are doomed to failure. &apos;This paper was made possible by a contract from International to SRI International, by a the Systems Development Foundation, and by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representative of the official policies, either expressed or implied, of ATR International, the Systems Development Foundation, or the Canadian government. IFeIlow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. There is something special about performative sentences, sentences such as &amp;quot;I promise to return&amp;quot;: uttering them makes them true. How and when is this possible? Not all verbs can be uttered in the first-person present tense and thereby make the sentence true. In general, the successful verbs seem to correspond to those naming illocutionary acts, but not to perlocutionary ones such as &amp;quot;frighten.&amp;quot; But, even some illocutionary verbs cannot be used performatively: e.g., &amp;quot;I lie to you that I didn&apos;t steal your watch&amp;quot; is self-defeating [12]. So, which verbs can be use performatively, and in Searle&apos;s words [10], &amp;quot;how do performatives work?&amp;quot; Any theory of illocutionary acts needs to prosolution to questions such as these. questions are not merely of theoretical in- Natural language database answering systems have been known to receive performative utterances [14], dialogue systems that recognize illocutionary acts (e.g., [6]) will need to infer the correct illocutionary force to function properly, dialogue translation systems [5] will have to cope with markers of illocutionary 79 force that function performatively (e.g., sentence final particles in Japanese), and proposals for &amp;quot;agent-oriented programming languages&amp;quot; [7, 13], well as Winograd and Flores&apos; [15] COORDINAare based on performative communication. For all these systems, it is important to understand the semantics and pragmatics of such communicative acts, especially their intended effects. To do so, one needs a full theory of illocutionary acts, and a format theory that predicts how utterances can be made true by uttering them. The currently accepted theory of performatives is that they are in fact assertions, hence true or false, and additionally constitute the performance of the named illocutionary act, in the same way as an indirect reading of an illocutionary act is obtained from the direct illocutionary act. That is, the named illocutionary act is derived from the assertion as an indirect speech act. The most compelling defense of this performative-as-assertion analysis that we are aware is that of Bach and Hataddress many of the linguistic phenomena discussed by Sadock [9], but who, we believe, have misa,nalyzed indirect speech acts. However, in a recent paper, Searle [10] forcefully criticizes the performative-as-assertion approach on the following grounds: • Assertions commit the speaker to the truth of what is asserted • Performative statements are self-referential • &amp;quot;An essential feature of any illocutionary act is the intention to perform that act&amp;quot; Searle claims that accounts based on selfreferential assertions are &amp;quot;doomed to failure&amp;quot; because one cannot show that being committed to having the intention to be performing the named illocutionary act entails that one in fact has that intention. Moreover, he questions that one should the named illocutionary act from an asserthan vice-versa, However, Searle has imparted into Bach and Harnish&apos;s theory his notion of assertions as commitments to the truth without providing a precise analysis of commit- What may be doomed to failure is any attempt to base an analysis of performatives on such a theory of assertions. This paper provides a formal analysis of performatives that treats them as declarative utterances, not initially as assertions, does not succumb to Searle&apos;s criticisms, and does not require an entirely new class of illocutionary acts (the &amp;quot;declarations&amp;quot;) as Searle and Vanderveken [121 have proposed. The analysis is offered as another adequacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts. That theory, more fully explicated in [3], is based on an analysis of the individual rational balance agents maintain among their beliefs, goals, intentions, commitments, and actions [2]. As desiderata for the theory of performatives, we demonstrate that the analysis meets two properties: • A sincere utterance of &amp;quot;I request you to open the door&amp;quot; is both a request and an assertion, yet neither illocutionary act characterization is derived from the other. • &amp;quot;I lie that the door is open&amp;quot; is self-defeating. Briefly, the ability to capture performatives is met almost entirely because such utterances are treated as indicative mood utterances, and because illocutionary acts are defined as attempts. Since attempts depend on the speaker&apos;s beliefs and goals, and these mental states are introspect able in our theory if a speaker sincerely says, for example, &amp;quot;I request you to open the door,&amp;quot; he must believe he did the act with the requisite beliefs and goals. Hence, the utterance is a request. To meet the desiderata we need first to present, albeit briefly, the theory of rational interaction, the treatment of declarative mood utterances, and then the illocutionary act definitions for requesting and asserting. Finally, we combine the various analyses natural language processor&apos;s task by making explicit the intended word sense of the action, and by reducing the combinatorics inherent in determining the attachment of the prepositional phrases. 80 2 Abbreviated theory of rational action Below, we give an abbreviated description of the theory of rational action upon which we erect a theory of intention. The theory is cast in a modal logic of belief, goal, action, and time. Further details of this logic can be found in [2]. 2.1 Syntax The language we use has the usual connectives of a first-order language with equality, as well as operators for the propositional attitudes and for talking about sequences of events: (BEL x p) and (GOAL x say that from x&apos;s beliefs or goals (a.k.a respectively; (AGT x that x is the agent for the sequence of events Ce2 is an initial subsequence of e2; and finally, a) and a) a sequence events describable by an action expression happen next or has just happened, respectively. Versions of HAPPENS and DONE specifying the agent (x) are also defined. An action expression here is built from variables ranging over sequences of events using the constructs of dynamic logic [LI]: a:b is action composition; alb is nondeterministic choice; alib is concuroccurrence of a and b; is a test action; and is repetition. The usual programming constructs such as IF/THEN actions and WHILE loops, can easily be formed from these. Because test actions occur frequently in our analysis, yet create considerable confusion, read p?;a as &amp;quot;action a occurring when p holds,&amp;quot; and for a;p?, read &amp;quot;aca occurs after which p holds.&amp;quot; We use ranging over sequences of events, and a action expressions. We adopt the following abbreviations and domain predicates. a p) (DONE a p) (HAPPENS a;p?) 3e (HAPPENS e;p?). p) differs front the BEFORE relation described in [3], which is here labelled PRIOR. clef Op = (PRIOR p q) 1 Vc (HAPPENS c;q?) (a A a;p?). The proposition p will become true no later than q. x p) p p). means that sentence s is an imperative. (DECLARATIVE s) means that sentence s, a string of words, is a declarative. (MAIN-VERB s v), (TENSE s tense), (COMPLE- MENT s s&apos;), (D-OBJECT s np), (SUBJECT s np), are all syntactic predicates intended to have the meanings that sentence s is true with reto some event sequence we will say has just been done.) np x that noun phrase np refers to thing x with respect to event e. (FULFILL-CONDS s e e&apos;) means that event e fulfills the satisfaction conditions, relative to event that are imposed by sentence For example, ifs is &amp;quot;wash the floor,&amp;quot; e would be a floor-washing event. 2.2 Assumptions The model we are developing embodies various assumptions constraining beliefs and choices (goals). First, BEL has a &amp;quot;weak S5&amp;quot; semantics, and GOAL a &amp;quot;system K&amp;quot; Among the remainthe following will be in this Beliefs imply choice: p) D (GOAL x p). free to substitute your favorite syntactic predicates. &apos;TRUE REFERS, and FULFILL-CONDS are just placeholders for semantic theories of truth, reference, and the meanings of imperatives, respectively. Their last event arguments would be used only in the interpretation of indexicals. &apos;See other work of ours [2] for a full model theory. &apos;In other words, we only deal with semantic structures where these propositions come out true. 81 This means that agents choose amongst worlds that are compatible with their beliefs. Goals are known: (GOAL x p) (BEL x (GOAL x p)). Memory: x (BEL x p)?;e) (BEL x (DONE x (BEL x p)?;e)). That is, agents remember what their beliefs were. 3 Individual Commitments and Intentions To capture one grade of commitment that an agent might have toward his goals, we define a persistent goal, P-GOAL, to be one that the agent will not give up until he thinks certain conditions are satisfied. Specifically, we have (P-GOAL p q) (BEL x (GOAL x (LATER (3) [KNOW x (PRIOR [(BEL x p)V(BEL x 0-43)V(BEL x —.[GOAL x (LATER p)])]. That is, the agent x believes p is currently false, chooses that it be true later, and knows that before abandoning that choice, he must either believe it is true, believe it never will be true, or believe q, an escape clause (used to model subgoals, reasons, etc.) is false. Intention is a species of persistent goal. We analyze two kinds of intentions, those to do actions and those to achieve propositions. Accordwe define INTEND] and to take action expressions and propositions as arguments, respectively. 2 def x a [DONE x (BEL x (HAPPENS a))?;a] q). x p q) (P-GOAL x Be[HAPPENS x (BEL x (HAPPENS x q) Intending to do an action a or achieve a proposition p is a special kind of commitment (i.e., persistent goal) to having done the action a or having However, it is not a simple commitment to having done a or e;p? for that would allow the agent to be committed to doing something accidentally or unknowingly. Instead, we require that the agent be committed to arriving at a state in which he believes he is about to do the intended action next. This completes a brief discussion of the foundational theory of intention and commitment. Next, we proceed to define the more specific concepts needed for analyzing communicative action. 4 Utterance Events We begin the analysis of utterance events by adopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance&apos;s features (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-final particles in Japanese) with the speaker&apos;s mental state, termed a &amp;quot;core attitude&amp;quot; in [3, 8]. Very roughly, a declarative utterance s will be correlated with the speaker&apos;s believing the uttered sentence is true, and an imperative utterance will be correlated with the speaker&apos;s wanting the addressee to do some action that fulfills the conditions imposed by the sentence. Let us notate these correlations as x (TRUE e)) (GOAL (DONE y e&apos;) (FULFILL-CONDS s e&apos; e) We formalize this notation below. Someone who thinks he is observing an utterance event will come to believe the speaker is in the correlated mental state, unless he has other beliefs to the contrary. For example, if the observer thinks the speaker is lying, he believes that the speaker does not believe the uttered sentence is true. But, because he may think the speaker takes himself to be especially convincing, the observer may still believe that the speaker thinks the observer is deceived. Hence, he would believe the simplicity, we omit here one condition from definition of 82 speaker thinks that he thinks the speaker believes P. This type of reasoning can continue to further levels. In general, if an utterance is produced when there are no countervailing observer beliefs at a certain level of nesting, then the result will be, at the given level of nesting, that the speaker is taken to be in the correlated mental state [8]. To be able to state such conditions, we need to be able to refer easily to what a person x believes about what y believes about what x believes etc., to arbitrary depths. To do so, we use the notion 3 (ABEL x y p) x (BEL x ...(BEL x p ) ...) is, the nth alternating belief between x and y that p, built up &amp;quot;from outside in,&amp;quot; i.e, starting with x&apos;s belief that p. On this basis, one can define unilateral mutual belief — what one agent believes is mutually believed — as follows. 4 (BMB y p) x y p) other words, x y p) is infinite conjuncx p) x (BEL y p)) ... we define mutual belief and mutual knowledge as follows. 5 (MB x y p) (BMB x y p) (BMB y x p). x y p) p x y Utterance events can produce effects at any (or no) level of alternating belief. For example, the speaker may not be trying to communicate anything to an intended observer. Illocutionary acts will be defined to require that the speaker intend produce In what follows, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between utterance events and full-blooded communicative acts. for Describing Utterance Events We now provide a formal notation for this correlation of utterance form and the speaker&apos;s mental state as a kind of default axiom (cf. [8]). First, we specify who is speaking (spkr), who is observing (ohs, which includes the speaker and addressee, but also others), who is being addressed (addr), what kind of sentence (s) spoken (indicated by III). We shall assume that everyone knows that a given utterance is of a given syntactic type (e.g., declarative), that speakers and addressees are observers, and that observers are by all to be 6 0 V spkr, obs, addr, e, s, n obs (DONE spkr e) spkr addr s e) (0 s)) A ohs spkr (BEFORE e ...(GOAL spkr [AFTER e (KNOW addr (BEFORE e a))]) )) spkr (BEFORE e A spkr [AFTER e (KNOW addr e tified implication roughly to the effect that if an that was done, where an uttering to addressee addr of a sentence in syntactic mood clb, and not believe done when the speaker did not want the addressee to come to know that the core speakerattitude a associated with utterances of that type then ohs believes that speaker in fact wanted the addressee to know that a, and so he, the observer, believes that a held just prior to the utterance. The notation states that at each level of alternating belief for which the antecedent holds, so does the consequent. The symbol now be understood textual-replacement &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot; operator. Since these correlations are of the form imply D VnC)(n). case of unseen observers is straightforward, but omitted here. 83 As we quantify over the positive integers indicating levels of alternative belief, we can derive the conclusion that under certain circumstances, addr thinks it is mutually believed (in our notation, BM B&apos;ed) that the speaker spkr wants addr to know Notice that right after the utterance, we are concerned with what mental state the observer thinks the speaker chose to bring about in the observer with that utterance. That is, the condition on utterance events involves the speaker&apos;s wanting to get the observer to know something, Without this temporal dimension, our performative analysis would fail. The analysis of performatives will say that after having uttered such a sentence, or while uttering it, the speaker believes he has just done or is doing the named illocutionary act. Typically, prior to uttering a performative, the speaker has not just performed that speech act, and so he would believe his having just done so is false. So, if the condition on utterance events in Domain -Axiom 1A involved only what the speaker believed or wanted to be true prior to the utterance, rather than after, all performatives would fail to achieve the observer&apos;s coming to believe anything. We can now state the correlation between utterance form and a speaker&apos;s mental state as a domain axiom. Axiom 1 Imperatives: A. =DECLARATIVE (BEL spkr (TRUE s e)) k (GOAL x 03eIDONE y e&apos;) A (FULFILL-CONDS s e e) I3elow, we present our definitions of illocutionary acts. Further justification can be found in [3]. 5 Illocutionary Acts as Attempts Searle [11] points out that an essential condition for requesting is that the speaker be attempting to get the addressee to perform the requested action. We take this observation one step further and deall illocutionary acts as attempts, hence defined in terms of the speaker&apos;s mental states. Atinvolve both types goal GOAL (merely chosen) and INTEND (chosen with commitment), as noted below. 7 (ATTEMPT xepq x p A x (GOAL x 0q)) (GOAL x 0q)]?; e That is, an attempt to achieve q via p is a complex action expression in which x is the agent of event e at time t1, and prior to e the agent believes p and q are both false, chooses that q should eventually be true, and intends, relative to that choice, that e should produce p. So, q represents some ultimate goal that may or may not be achieved by the attempt, while p represents what it takes to make an honest effort. 5.1 Definitions of Request and Assert To characterize a request or, for that matter, any illocutionary action, we must decide on the appropriate formulas to substitute for p and q in the defan attempt. We constrain illocutionary to be those in which the speaker committed to understanding, that is, to achieving a state of BM B that he is in a certain mental state. Below is a definition of a speaker&apos;s requesting an addressee to achieve p. {REQUEST e p {ATTEMPT spkr e [BMB addr spkr (BEFORE e (GOAL spkr [AFTER e addr p Op) (HELPFUL addr spkr)] )])]] 3e&apos; (DONE addr e&apos;;p7) That is, event e is a request at time t1 if it is an attempt at that time to get the addressee to 84 some condition being committed to making public that the speaker wanted: first, that p eventually be achieved; and second, that the addressed party should intend to achieve it relative to the speaker&apos;s wanting it achieved and relative to the addressee&apos;s being helpfully disposed towards the speaker. The illocutionary act of asserting will be defined as an attempt to make the speaker&apos;s believing the propositional content mutually believed. 9 {ASSERT spkr addr e t1} {ATTEMPT spkr addr e [BMB addr spkr (BEFORE e [GOAL spkr (AFTER e [KNOW addr (BEFORE e spkr (BMB addr spkr (BEFORE e (BEL spkr p))) t1} precisely, assertions at time are defined as attempts in which to make an &amp;quot;honest effort,&amp;quot; the speaker is committed to getting the addressee to believe that it is mutually believed that the speaker wanted prior to the utterance that the addressee would come to know that the speaker believed p held then. That is, just like a request, an assertion makes public that the speaker wants the addressee to know what mental state he was in. Although he is committed to that, what the has chosen to achieve is not public his the addressee know what mental state he was in, but to make public that he was in fact in that state of believing p. For an INFORM, the speaker would choose to achieve (KNOW addr p). 6 Performatives To illustrate how performatives work, we show when both assertions and requests can be derived from the utterance of the performative &amp;quot;I request you to &lt;do act&gt;.&amp;quot; The important point to notice here is that we have not had to add to our machinery; performative utterances will be treated exactly as declarative utterances, with the exception that the content of the utterance will make reference to an utterance event. Reports Let us characterize the truth conditions of the of declarative sentences &amp;quot;x requests (imperative sentence s&apos;).&amp;quot; Let s be such a sen- Let r be y ei) (FULFILLs&apos; e). We ignore most syntactic considerations and indexicality for reasons of space. Axiom 2 tense requests y, e, (DONE ti?;e) A s x) s y) x e) y y e) (TRUE s e) (DONE x {REQUEST xy e t1}) That is, if event e is happening and the sentence s is a present tense declarative sentence whose main verb is &amp;quot;request,&amp;quot; whose subject x refers to person x, and whose direct object y refers to person y, then the sentence is true if x is requesting the addressee y to fulfill the conditions of imperative sentence s&apos;. A bare present (or present progressive) tense sentence is true when the event being described is contemporaneous with the event of This definition applies equally well to &amp;quot;John requests Mary to ...&amp;quot; as it does when I utter &amp;quot;I request you to ...&amp;quot; For the former, such sentences are likely to be narrations of ongoing For the latter, the event that is happening that makes the utterance true is the speaker&apos;s uttering of the sentence. By our definition of request, for x to request to achieve p, x has to attempt to get y to some action intentionally to fulfill the sentence s&apos;, by making that goal mutually believed between them. Thus, to say x requested y to do something is only to say that x had the right beliefs, goals, and intentions. [111 correctly points out that performatives can be uttered in the passive, and in the first-person are ignoring the habitual reading of bare present tense sentences because we do not have a se- 85 Used as Requests Next, we treat performative sentences as declarmeans that the effects of uttering them are described by Domain Axiom 1A. We sketch below a proof of a general theorem regarding performative requests, with s being the declarative sentence &amp;quot;I request you toOmperative and a being addr e). We take the uttering sentence be a unitary utterance event. Performative Request kV spkr, addr, e, n, ti, addr (DONE spkr ti?;e) spkr addr e s)) (GOAL spkr (KNOW addr (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))])])) D (DONE {REQUEST spkr addr e a t}) That is, we need to show that if the sentence &amp;quot;I request you to &lt;imperative sentence&gt;&amp;quot; has just uttered at time sincerely, i.e., when the speaker wanted the addressee to know that he believed the sentence was true, then a direct request place at ti. sketch: Essentially, one the domain axiom for declaratives at the first level of ABEL, entailing that the speaker believes that he believes that he has just done a REQUEST. Then, one expands the definition of REQUEST into an then into its parts. The definition of ATTEMPT is based on BEL, GOAL and INTEND, the first two of which are obviously introspectable. That is, if one believes one has them one does, and vice-versa. Hence, by the memory assumption, the speaker actually had them prior to the utterance. More critically, intending to act time t1 is also introspectable at time because agents know what they are doing at the next instant and because there is no time to drop their [2]. Thus, one repackage mental states up into an ATTEMPT and then a REQUEST. 6.3 Performatives Used as Assertions We have shown that the speaker of a sincere performative utterance containing an illocutionary verb has performed the illocutionary act named by that verb. Under somewhat stronger conditions, we can also prove that the speaker has made an assertion. As before, let s be &amp;quot;I request you to &lt;imperative sentence&gt;.&amp;quot; 2 Used as Assertions addr, e, n, ti, addr (DONE spkr ti?;e) spkr addr e s)) [BEFORE e (BEL spkr [AFTER e Vn--(ABEL n addr spkr spkr [AFTER e (KNOW addr [BEFORE e (BEL spkr (TRUE s e))]] This default condition says that before the utterance, the speaker believed there would be no addressee belief after the utterance event (at any level n) to the effect that prior to that event the speaker did not want the addressee to come to know that the speaker believed (TRUE s e). Given Domain Axiom 1A, and the fact that BEL entails suffices to entail the definition of assertion. Notice that whereas requesting was derived in virtue of the content of the utterance, an assertion was derived by default assumptions regarding lack of belief in the speaker&apos;s insincerity. 7 &apos;Lie&apos; is not a performative Some illocutionary verbs such as &amp;quot;lie,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hint,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;insinuate,&amp;quot; cannot be achieved performatively. The following analysis shows a general model for why verbs naming covert cannot be perfor- A reasonable definition of lying is the following 86 addr e p} spkr spkr addr e p That is, a lie is an assertion performed when the speaker believes the propositional content is false. For &amp;quot;I lie to you that the door is open&amp;quot; to be a successful performative utterance, it would have to be true that the utterance is a lie. We would have to show that the uttering of that declarative sentence results in a lie&apos;s having been done. More generally, we provide a putative statement of the conditions of to y that &lt;declarative sentence s&apos;&gt;. .&amp;quot; Call the main sentence s. Axiom 3 Truth Conditions for Performative Lying x, y, (DONE e) (TRUE s e) (DONE {LIE x y e (TRUE s&apos; e) ti} ) is, if s are declarative sentences of appropriate syntactic form, to x and to y, then s is true if in performing it at x was lying that sentence s&apos; is true. So we can prove the following. Let the sentence be to you that &lt;declarative sentence s&apos;&gt;.&amp;quot; 3 are not performative addr, e, [(DONE spkr (UTTER spkr addr e s)]) {LIE spkr addr e (TRUE s e) In other words, you cannot perform a lie by saying &amp;quot;I lie that ...&amp;quot; Sketch: that it is mutually believed that the speaker has uttered declarative sentence s. Now, apply Domain Axiom 1A. By assumption, the first conjuct of the antecddent holds. There are then two cases to consider. First, assume (**) the second conjunct holds (say, at level n = 1), i.e., the addressee does not believe the speaker did not want him to know that he believed s&apos; was true. In virtue of the supposed truth conditions on lying, spkr would have to have been lying. By expanding its definition, and using the memory and introspectability properties of BEL, and addressee can conclude that, before the utterance, the speaker wanted him not to know that the speaker believes that in uttering 5, he was lying. But, this contradicts the assumption (**). Since the speaker in fact uttered the sentence, that assumption is false, and the addressee believes the speaker did not in fact want him to know that he believed the sentence was true. This renders impossible the intentions to be achieved in asserting, which are constitutive of lying as well. Now, assume (&amp;quot;) is false, so the addressee in fact believes the speaker did not want him to know s&apos; Again, this immediately makes the speaker&apos;s intentions in asserting, and hence lying, impossible to achieve. So, in neither case is the utterance a lie. If the addressee believes the speaker is a competent speaker of the language, the speaker must have intended some other interpretation. 8 Conclusion Requesting works well as a performative verb because requesting requires only that the agent has made an attempt, and need not have succeeded in getting the hearer to do the requested action, or even to form the right beliefs. Some verbs cannot be used performatively, such as &amp;quot;frighten,&amp;quot; because they require something beyond a mere attempt. Renee, such verbs would name action expressions that required a particular proposition p be true after the utterance event. When the utterance event does not guarantee such a p, the use of the performative verb will not be possible. On the other hand, certain utterances (performative or not), when performed by the right people in the right circumstances, make certain institutional facts hold. So, when a clergyman, judge, or ship captain says &amp;quot;I now pronounce you husband and wife,&amp;quot; the man and woman in question are married. In our framework, there would be a domain axiom whose antecedent characterizes the circumstances, participants, and nature of the utterance event, and whose consequent asserts that an institutional fact is true. The axiom is justified not by the nature of rational action, but by the existence of an institution. Such utterances could be 57 made with a performative prefix provided such attempts are made into successes by the institution. paper that treating performautterances sentences is a viable analysis, in spite of Searle&apos;s criticisms. The performative use of an illocutionary verb is selfguaranteeing when the named illocutionary act consists in the speaker&apos;s making an attempt to make public his mental state. In such casts, if the speaker thinks he has done so, then he has. However, we do not derive the named illocutionary act from the assertion, nor vice-versa. Instead, both derivations may be made from the utterance event, but the assertive one is in fact harder to obtain as it has extra conditions that need to be satisfied.</abstract>

This paper provides a formal analysis of performatives that treats them as declarative utterances, not initially as assertions, does not succumb to Searle&apos;s criticisms, and does not require an entirely new class of illocutionary acts (the &amp;quot;declarations&amp;quot;) as Searle and Vanderveken [121 have proposed. The analysis is offered as another adequacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts. That theory, more fully explicated in [3], is based on an analysis of the individual rational balance agents maintain among their beliefs, goals, intentions, commitments, and actions [2]. As desiderata for the theory of performatives, we demonstrate that the analysis meets two properties: • A sincere utterance of &amp;quot;I request you to open the door&amp;quot; is both a request and an assertion, yet neither illocutionary act characterization is derived from the other. • &amp;quot;I lie that the door is open&amp;quot; is self-defeating.

Finally, we combine the various analyses natural language processor&apos;s task by making explicit the intended word sense of the action, and by reducing the combinatorics inherent in determining the attachment of the prepositional phrases. 80 2 Abbreviated theory of rational action Below, we give an abbreviated description of the theory of rational action upon which we erect a theory of intention. The theory is cast in a modal logic of belief, goal, action, and time. Further details of this logic can be found in [2]. 2.1 Syntax The language we use has the usual connectives of a first-order language with equality, as well as operators for the propositional attitudes and for talking about sequences of events: (BEL x p) and (GOAL x p) say that p follows from x&apos;s beliefs or goals (a.k.a choices) respectively; (AGT x e) says that x is the only agent for the sequence of events e; el Ce2 says that el is an initial subsequence of e2; and finally, (HAPPENS a) and (DONE a) say that a sequence of events describable by an action expression a will happen next or has just happened, respectively. Versions of HAPPENS an</context>

First, BEL has a &amp;quot;weak S5&amp;quot; semantics, and GOAL has a &amp;quot;system K&amp;quot; semantics.4 Among the remaining assumptions, the following will be used in this paper.5 Beliefs imply choice: k (BEL x p) D (GOAL x p). 2Feel free to substitute your favorite syntactic predicates. &apos;TRUE REFERS, and FULFILL-CONDS are just placeholders for semantic theories of truth, reference, and the meanings of imperatives, respectively. Their last event arguments would be used only in the interpretation of indexicals. &apos;See other work of ours [2] for a full model theory. &apos;In other words, we only deal with semantic structures where these propositions come out true. 81 This means that agents choose amongst worlds that are compatible with their beliefs. Goals are known: (GOAL x p) (BEL x (GOAL x p)). Memory: (DONE x (BEL x p)?;e) E (BEL x (DONE x (BEL x p)?;e)). That is, agents remember what their beliefs were. 3 Individual Commitments and Intentions To capture one grade of commitment that an agent might have toward his goals, we define a persistent goal, P-GOAL, to be one that the agent will not give up until he thinks certain condition</context>

Someone who thinks he is observing an utterance event will come to believe the speaker is in the correlated mental state, unless he has other beliefs to the contrary. For example, if the observer thinks the speaker is lying, he believes that the speaker does not believe the uttered sentence is true. But, because he may think the speaker takes himself to be especially convincing, the observer may still believe that the speaker thinks the observer is deceived. Hence, he would believe the 6For simplicity, we omit here one condition from the definition of INTEND2 in [2]. 82 speaker thinks that he thinks the speaker believes P. This type of reasoning can continue to further levels. In general, if an utterance is produced when there are no countervailing observer beliefs at a certain level of nesting, then the result will be, at the given level of nesting, that the speaker is taken to be in the correlated mental state [8]. To be able to state such conditions, we need to be able to refer easily to what a person x believes about what y believes about what x believes etc., to arbitrary depths. To do so, we use the notion of ABEL. Definition 3 (ABEL n x y p) dt-f </context>

Instead, we require that the agent be committed to arriving at a state in which he believes he is about to do the intended action next. This completes a brief discussion of the foundational theory of intention and commitment. Next, we proceed to define the more specific concepts needed for analyzing communicative action. 4 Utterance Events We begin the analysis of utterance events by adopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance&apos;s features (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-final particles in Japanese) with the speaker&apos;s mental state, termed a &amp;quot;core attitude&amp;quot; in [3, 8]. Very roughly, a declarative utterance s will be correlated with the speaker&apos;s believing the uttered sentence is true, and an imperative utterance will be correlated with the speaker&apos;s wanting the addressee to do some action that fulfills the conditions imposed by the sentence.

So, if the condition on utterance events in Domain -Axiom 1A involved only what the speaker believed or wanted to be true prior to the utterance, rather than after, all performatives would fail to achieve the observer&apos;s coming to believe anything. We can now state the correlation between utterance form and a speaker&apos;s mental state as a domain axiom. Domain Axiom 1 Declaratives and Imperatives: A. =DECLARATIVE (BEL spkr (TRUE s e)) B. k IMPERATIVE (GOAL x 03eIDONE y e&apos;) A (FULFILL-CONDS s e e) I3elow, we present our definitions of illocutionary acts. Further justification can be found in [3]. 5 Illocutionary Acts as Attempts Searle [11] points out that an essential condition for requesting is that the speaker be attempting to get the addressee to perform the requested action. We take this observation one step further and define all illocutionary acts as attempts, hence defined in terms of the speaker&apos;s mental states. Attempts involve both types of goal states, GOAL (merely chosen) and INTEND (chosen with commitment), as noted below. Definition 7 (ATTEMPT xepq t1} ti?;[(BEL x p A --,q) A (INTEND&apos; x ti?:e;p?

Instead, we require that the agent be committed to arriving at a state in which he believes he is about to do the intended action next. This completes a brief discussion of the foundational theory of intention and commitment. Next, we proceed to define the more specific concepts needed for analyzing communicative action. 4 Utterance Events We begin the analysis of utterance events by adopting a Gricean correlation of an utterance&apos;s features (e.g., syntactic mood or sentence-final particles in Japanese) with the speaker&apos;s mental state, termed a &amp;quot;core attitude&amp;quot; in [3, 8]. Very roughly, a declarative utterance s will be correlated with the speaker&apos;s believing the uttered sentence is true, and an imperative utterance will be correlated with the speaker&apos;s wanting the addressee to do some action that fulfills the conditions imposed by the sentence. Let us notate these correlations as DECLARATIVE (BEL x (TRUE s e)) IMPERATIVE (GOAL x 03e&apos; (DONE y e&apos;) A (FULFILL-CONDS s e&apos; e) We formalize this notation below. Someone who thinks he is observing an utterance event will come to believe the speaker is in the correlated mental state, unless he has other beliefs to the c</context>

Hence, he would believe the 6For simplicity, we omit here one condition from the definition of INTEND2 in [2]. 82 speaker thinks that he thinks the speaker believes P. This type of reasoning can continue to further levels. In general, if an utterance is produced when there are no countervailing observer beliefs at a certain level of nesting, then the result will be, at the given level of nesting, that the speaker is taken to be in the correlated mental state [8]. To be able to state such conditions, we need to be able to refer easily to what a person x believes about what y believes about what x believes etc., to arbitrary depths. To do so, we use the notion of ABEL. Definition 3 (ABEL n x y p) dt-f (BEL x (BEL y (BEL x ...(BEL x p ) ...) That is, ABEL characterises the nth alternating belief between x and y that p, built up &amp;quot;from outside in,&amp;quot; i.e, starting with x&apos;s belief that p. On this basis, one can define unilateral mutual belief — what one agent believes is mutually believed — as follows. Definition 4 (BMB x y p) Vn(ABEL n x y p) In other words</context>

For example, the speaker may not be trying to communicate anything to an intended observer. Illocutionary acts will be defined to require that the speaker intend to produce BM Be. In what follows, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between utterance events and full-blooded communicative acts. 4.1 Notation for Describing Utterance Events We now provide a formal notation for this correlation of utterance form and the speaker&apos;s mental state as a kind of default axiom (cf. [8]). First, we specify who is speaking (spkr), who is observing (ohs, which includes the speaker and addressee, but also others), who is being addressed (addr), and what kind of sentence (s) has been spoken (indicated by III). We shall assume that everyone knows that a given utterance is of a given syntactic type (e.g., declarative), that speakers and addressees are observers, and that observers are known by all to be observing.7 Definition 6 0 aag V spkr, obs, addr, e, s, n (KNOW obs (DONE spkr e) A (UTTER spkr addr s e) A (0 s)) A --(ABEL n ohs spkr (BEFORE e ...(GOAL spkr [AFTER e (KNOW addr </context>
