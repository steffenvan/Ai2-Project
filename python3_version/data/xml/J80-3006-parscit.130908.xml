done to determine the best control strategy to use.
The control issues that were tested were left to right
processing through the sentence versus an &amp;quot;island
driven&amp;quot; strategy, examining all the words that might
be present in a given location at once versus taking
them one at a time, doing time-consuming but accurate
context checking as soon as possible versus delaying
such checking, and focusing the processing on a single
hypothesis versus skipping around to whatever hypoth-
esis seemed best at the time. The average reader will
probably be more interested in the results of the ex-
periments than the details of them, however.
The third chapter explains the semantic component
of the system, which was represented by the parti-
tioned network scheme of Gary Hendrix. With many
detailed examples, Hendrix shows how the partitioning
scheme was used to encode quantifiers and logical
connectives (conjunction, disjunction, negation, impli-
cation), to form associations between semantic objects
and the syntactic units of the input, to distinguish
between new and old information, to encode multiple
hypotheses, to allow sharing of representations among
competing hypotheses, and to define hierarchies for
discourse analysis. The semantic component of the
system used this formalism to filter out combinations
of words that were acoustically and syntactically ac-
ceptable but semantically unacceptable; it also con-
structed a representation of the meaning of good inter-
pretations for other components to use, and could
make predictions of words or structures that were
likely to occur in other parts of the utterance.
The next chapter is devoted to Barbara Grosz&apos;s
work on discourse knowledge. After showing exam-
ples of how the focus of a dialogue affects the identifi-
cation of definite noun phrases, word sense interpreta-
tion, pronominal reference, and ellipsis, she discusses
(again, in more detail than some readers would wish)
the analysis of actual problem solving and question
answering dialogs which were examined to provide the
basis for a representation of focus that would enable
the SRI system to use focus in its semantic interpreta-
tions. The notion of focus spaces which was derived
from these experiments was represented in Hendrix&apos;s
partitioned network formalism and used for resolution
of noun phrases, inferencing, reference resolution, and
other high level aspects of sentential processing. The
problems of shifting focus, reinvoking an old focus of
attention, and dealing with ellipsis are also covered in
detail.
The fifth chapter comprises three sections relating
to the problem of responding to an utterance once it
has been understood. This is unfortunately limited in
scope, since the major emphasis of the project was on
understanding rather than responding to spoken lan-
guage. Gary Hendrix writes on the problem of inter-
acting with the deduction component and an English
generator to formulate a reply. Richard Fikes and
Gary Hendrix detail the deduction component, and
Jonathan Slocum&apos;s section deals with generating an
English description of a semantic structure. The con-
clusion, written by Ann Robinson, summarizes the
work and points out issues relating to other areas of
research.
One of the chief features of the book is the large
number of illustrations and detailed examples, includ-
ing as an appendix a short but well chosen example of
the entire processing of a single utterance.
Someone already familiar with the ARPA speech
project will gain little from this book, and someone
interested in a general overview of the speech under-
standing problem and the ARPA project&apos;s results
would do better to look elsewhere [1, 21. What this
book has to offer is something rare but not unimpor-
tant in the literature: a detailed description of a single
large and complex system. One can get from it not
only an understanding of how that system worked but
also an excellent understanding of the important pieces
of that work which have had a continuing influence in
the field of computational linguistics since the termina-
tion of this particular project.

This book can be reviewed from two perspectives:
(1) as a general and technical introduction to the com-
plexities and subtleties regarding human understanding
of and response to questions and (2) as a much more
comprehensive system, intended to produce not only
humanlike interpretations of questions, but doing so in
ways that model human thought processes. Lehnert
appears to have both approaches in mind, emphasizing
the second more, but it is with respect to only the first
that the book is successful.
From this first perspective, then, there is no other
single source that so completely and persuasively illus-
trates the many-faceted problems of translating a
person&apos;s question (e.g., &amp;quot;Do you have a match?&amp;quot; vs.
&amp;quot;Do you have a hangover?&amp;quot;) into a valid interpreta-
tion of the questioner&apos;s desires or information require-
ments (e.g., &amp;quot;Give me a light&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;How is your physi-
cal state after last night?&amp;quot;). Lehnert provides abun-
dant evidence for the necessity of utilizing a wide
American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 3-4, July-December 1980 187

variety of information in the analysis of questions.
This information can lead to the transformation of the
immediate naive understanding of the question into a
drastically changed conceptualization.
There are four major components to the question-
analysis and answer-generation approach she de-
scribes: (1) different kinds of knowledge sources, (2)
a variety of mapping and inferencing principles, (3) a
parser which converts the surface text into one of a
small number of conceptual representations (actually,
Schank&apos;s system), and (4) a structured taxonomy of
question types, one of which is assigned to the parsed
representation. Among the most important knowledge
sources are those involving &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot; and contexts.
The well established notion of &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot; refers to the
fact that many human activities have a stereotypical
pattern of actions and events (e.g., eating at a restau-
rant: &amp;quot;look for table, go to table, ask for menu, get
menu, be served,&amp;quot; from Fig. 6.1, p. 141). Given that
a script is judged to apply (e.g., cued by a verbal nar-
rative beginning &amp;quot;John went into a restaurant&amp;quot;), Leh-
nert indicates how the details of the script can provide
the basis for interpreting and responding to a wide
variety of questions (e.g., &amp;quot;What did John do next?&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Did John eat?&amp;quot;). The importance of prior communi-
cation and the physical setting are also stressed as
contextual sources of information for establishing top-
ics or references that would otherwise be indetermi-
nate. Two other knowledge sources, stressed as im-
portant but worked out in less detail, are general
world-knowledge and personal memories.
Lehnert outlines as the second major system com-
ponent a number of specific inferencing mechanisms
for hypothesizing an initial question-type, for utilizing
knowledge sources to translate this into a more valid
representation, and for generating the answer. Indeed,
she invokes, in one way or another, most of the impor-
tant concepts involved in artificial intelligence. The
use of inferencing principles and alternative knowledge
sources can be governed by rather flexible search heu-
ristics, but the power and accuracy of her approach
depend critically on the use of a small number of
conceptual-representation and question categories, the
third and fourth system components. While a number
of technical questions can be raised as to the adequacy
of these categories, she does provide many examples in
support of these, illustrating how fine distinctions
among conceptualizations and question-types might be
made.
Were Lehnert&apos;s goals only those described as the
first review perspective, she would have achieved them
rather remarkably: Many thorny problems in question-
answering are presented, and she illustrates in some
detail the processing algorithms that could be applied
to provide a solution; she also indicates numerous
areas where further work is needed. There is no ques-
tion but that Lehnert provides an important and de-
tailed introduction to these problems as well as a sig-
nificant challenge to both psychologists and computer
scientists for testing or extending the theoretical ideas
proposed.
Lehnert&apos;s goals were, however, much more ambi-
tious, as indicated by the book&apos;s subtitle, and through-
out. In the preface, having shortened the phrase
&amp;quot;human information processing&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;information proc-
essing,&amp;quot; she states that &amp;quot;this book describes question
answering as a particular task in information process-
ing&amp;quot; (p. viii). In the first paragraph, she says, &amp;quot;This
thesis presents a process model of question answering
as a theory of conceptual information processing&amp;quot;
(p. 1). In her final sentence, she summarizes by saying
that her system is &amp;quot;a theory of question answering that
is founded on and extends theories of natural language
and conceptual information processing&amp;quot; (p. 270).
On the basis of these very strong claims, the reader
may justifiably expect to find supporting evidence of
three kinds: (1) that the syntactic and semantic prob-
lems of question-interpretation identified and dis-
cussed extensively by linguists will be acknowledged
and dealt with, (2) that existing psychological evidence
on language and problem-solving behavior in general,
and question-answering in particular, will be reviewed
and related to the processing principles of the system,
and (3) that performance statistics will be provided for
a wide variety of test questions, with comparisons
made of the system&apos;s interpretations and intermediate
processing steps to those of humans.
In fact, none of these expectations is fulfilled.
With respect to linguistic data, there is almost no ref-
erence at all to the enormous body of literature that
exists on the interpretation of interrogatives (e.g.,
Aqvist&apos;s A New Approach to the Logical Theory of In-
terrogatives, 1975, and Hudson&apos;s The Meaning of Ques-
tions, 1975). Even without discussion of the particular
views of linguists, there still are well-known technical
linguistic problems which surely should be addressed
by systems intended to implement computer processing
of questions, such as whether noun phrases are to be
understood referentially or attributively, determining
qualifier scope, and interpreting quantification (see the
Syntax and Semantics book series by Academic Press).
The notable exception is her criticism, in a discussion
of semantics, of Katz and Fodor&apos;s (1964) theory as
being inadequate for semantically representing the
equivalence of active-passive transformations (p. 249).
She fails to report, however, that Katz&apos;s later book
(Semantic Theory, 1972), which is an extension and
modification of his earlier work, does in fact provide
for exactly the type of representation for which she
seemed to be arguing.
With respect to psychological data, no reference is
made to the sizable body of literature concerning the
development of human question-asking (e.g., Davis,

&amp;quot;The form and function of children&apos;s questions,&amp;quot;
1932), nor to work concerning adult question-
answering (e.g., Wright, &amp;quot;Some observations on how
people answer questions about sentences,&amp;quot; 1972), nor
even to work closely paralleling her own approach in
the use of a question taxonomy (e.g., Kearsley,
&amp;quot;Question and question asking in verbal discourse: A
cross-disciplinary review,&amp;quot; 1976). Even more distress-
ing is the fact that the human problem-solving litera-
ture, larger by orders of magnitude than the specific
work on question-answering, is not reviewed to pro-
vide a comparison for her system&apos;s detailed search and
inferencing processes.
Finally, almost no performance data of any kind
are provided, not even the complete details of the
processing for a single example. In view of the incom-
pleteness of presentation with respect to the exact
details, one has no way of ascertaining the limitations
of her system. Since most of the examples given were
trivial with respect to the syntactic complexity of ques-
tions for which other question-answering systems have
been designed, and since the system appears to be
very modest with respect to the size of its knowledge
structures relative to more representative situations,
there still remains considerable question whether or
not her system is designed on sufficiently extendible
principles to permit handling of these more realistic
instances.
Despite Lehnert&apos;s failure to provide support for her
more extravagant claims, the reader who adopts the
less demanding perspective will be well rewarded.

This attractive and well-written book describes
QUALM, a facility for question-answering developed
by the author in conjunction with systems designed by
Roger Schank and others at Yale. But it is a good
deal more than a system description, and it will be
read with interest and profit by logicians (particularly
for its contributions to the logic of questions and an-
swers), students of mind and of the philosophy of
science (for its defense of the methods used in artifi-
cial intelligence research), and, in fact, all the readers
of this polyglot newsletter [i.e. CBI]. Someone teach-
ing a course that touched on Al techniques might use
this as a concrete example, suitable for intensive study
-- the writing is clear, full of intriguing examples, con-
cerned with serious problems, and accessible to read-
ers without any background at all in computer science.
The logic of questions and answers has developed
only recently. (For an excellent introduction to this
&amp;quot;erotetic logic,&amp;quot; with an extensive bibliography, see
Nuel D. Belnap, Jr. and Thomas B. Steel, Jr., The Log-
ic of Questions and Answers, New Haven: Yale Univer-
sity Press, 1976.) Inspired by the need for realistic
dialogue with users of a natural language system, it has
attempted to identify the presuppositions that enter
into questions and appropriate responses to them. To
take one of the hoariest examples, &amp;quot;Is the present king
of France bald?&amp;quot; presupposes that there is now a king
of France (Belnap and Steel, p. 110). If we are going
to build a system that responds helpfully to this ques-
tion, it is going to have to have some way of identify-
ing the presupposition.
But this is only one of the questions that Lehnert
addresses, and not the most interesting or important
one. The role of context, the appropriateness of the
answer, the focus of the question, the memory repre-
sentations that are required, the inferences that the
answerer must make, search strategies -- these and
many other problems are raised at the beginning of the
book. The remaining chapters describe the way in
which she solves them.
QUALM reflects the concepts and approaches that
Schank and others have developed at Yale. (Cf. R.C.
Schank and R.P. Abelson, Scripts, Plans, Goals and
Understanding, Hillsdale, N.J. : Lawrence Erlbaum
Associates, 1977.) These notions, including the con-
ceptual dependency approach, and the use of scripts to
represent expected behavior in a situation, are de-
scribed in sufficient detail to permit the reader to fol-
low Lehnert&apos;s discussion without previous exposure to
them.
I found that the book helped greatly to clarify the
current status of natural language processing, docu-
menting the tremendous strides that were taken during
the 1970&apos;s. (The contrast between this book and Ter-
ry Winograd&apos;s pioneering Understanding Natural Lan-
guage, New York: Academic Press, 1972, is quite
overwhelming.) Equally interesting, I think, is the
degree to which Lehnert gives us a sense of what Al
research is doing, why it thinks that it is a science, and
what counts as a successful experiment in Al.
