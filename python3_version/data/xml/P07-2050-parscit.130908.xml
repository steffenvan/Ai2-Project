<bodyText confidence="0.999983666666667">
We propose a novel method to expand a
small existing translation dictionary to a
large translation dictionary using a pivot lan-
guage. Our method depends on the assump-
tion that it is possible to find a pivot lan-
guage for a given language pair on con-
dition that there are both a large transla-
tion dictionary from the source language
to the pivot language, and a large transla-
tion dictionary from the pivot language to
the destination language. Experiments that
expands the Indonesian-Japanese dictionary
using the English language as a pivot lan-
guage shows that the proposed method can
improve performance of a real CLIR system.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9988818">
Rich cross lingual resources including large trans-
lation dictionaries are necessary in order to realize
working cross-lingual NLP applications. However,
it is infeasible to build such resources for all lan-
guage pairs, because there are many languages in the
world. Actually, while rich resources are available
for several popular language pairs like the English
language and the Japanese language, poor resources
are only available for rest unfamiliar language pairs.
In order to resolve this situation, automatic con-
struction of translation dictionary is effective, but it
is quite difficult as widely known. We, therefore,
concentrate on the task of expanding a small existing
translation dictionary instead of it. Let us consider
three dictionaries: a small seed dictionary which
consists of headwords in the source language and
their translations in the destination language, a large
source-pivot dictionary which consists of headwords
in the source language and their translations in the
pivot language, and a large pivot-destination dictio-
nary which consists of headwords in the pivot lan-
guage and their translations in the destination lan-
guage. When these three dictionaries are given, ex-
panding the seed dictionary is to translate words in
the source language that meets two conditions: (1)
they are not contained in the seed dictionary, and (2)
they can be translated to the destination language
transitively referring both the source-pivot dictio-
nary and the pivot-destination dictionary.
Obviously, this task depends on two assumptions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.910481357142857">
(a) the existence of the small seed dictionary, and
(b) the existence of the pivot language which meets
the condition that there are both a large source-
pivot dictionary and a large pivot-destination dic-
tionary. Because of the first assumption, it is true
that this task cannot be applied to a brand-new lan-
guage pair. However, the number of such brand-
new language pairs are decreasing while machine-
readable language resources are increasing. More-
over, The second assumption is valid for many lan-
guage pairs, when supposing the English language
as a pivot. From these point of view, we think that
the expansion task is more promising, although it de-
pends more assumptions than the construction task.

<bodyText confidence="0.999978416666667">
There are two different points among the expan-
sion task and the construction task. Previous re-
searches of the construction task can be classified
into two groups. The first group consists of re-
searches to construct a new translation dictionary for
a fresh language pair from existing translation dic-
tionaries or other language resources (Tanaka and
Umemura, 1994). In the first group, information of
the seed dictionary are not counted in them unlike
the expansion task, because it is assumed that there
is no seed dictionary for such fresh language pairs.
The second group consists of researches to translate

novel words using both a large existing translation
dictionary and other linguistic resources like huge
parallel corpora (Tonoike et al., 2005). Because al-
most of novel words are nouns, these researches fo-
cus into the task of translating nouns. In the expan-
sion task, however, it is necessary to translate verbs
and adjectives as well as nouns, because a seed dic-
tionary will be so small that only basic words will be
contained in it if the target language pair is unfamil-
iar. We will discuss about this topic in Section 3.2.
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: Section 2 describes the method to expand a
small seed dictionary. The experiments presented in
Section 3 shows that the proposed method can im-
prove performance of a real CLIR system. This pa-
per ends with concluding remarks in Section 4.

2 Method of Expanding Seed Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885176470588">
The proposed method roughly consists of two steps
shown in Figure 1. The first step is to generate a co-
occurrence vector on the destination language cor-
responding to an input word, using both the seed
dictionary and a monolingual corpus in the source
language. The second step is to list translation can-
didates up, referring both the source-pivot dictionary
and the pivot-destination dictionary, and to calculate
their co-occurrence vectors based on a monolingual
corpus in the destination.
The seed dictionary is used to convert a co-
occurrence vector in the source language into a
vector in the destination language. In this paper,
f(wi, wj) represents a co-occurrence frequency of
a word wi and a word wj for all languages. A co-
occurrence vector v(xs) of a word xs in the source
is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.980611">
v(xs) = (f(xs, x1), ... , f(xs, xn)), (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851166666667">
where xi(i = 1, 2, ... , n) is a headword of the
seed dictionary D. A co-occurrence vector v(xs),
whose each element is corresponding to a word in
the source, is converted into a vector vt(xs), whose
each element is corresponding to a word in the des-
tination, referring the dictionary D:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989694">
vt(xs) = (ft(xs, z1), ... , ft(xs, zm)), (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999">
where zj(j = 1, 2, ... , m) is a translation word
which appears in the dictionary D. The function
ft(xs, zk), which assigns a co-occurrence degree be-
tween a word xs and a word zj in the destination
based on a co-occurrence vector of a word xs in the
source, is defined as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9949845">
ft(xs, zj) = ∑n f(xs, xi) · δ(xi, zj). (3)
i=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992006307692308">
where δ(xi, zj) is equal to one when a word zj is in-
cluded in a translation word set D(xi), which con-
sists of translation words of a word xi, and zero oth-
erwise.
A set of description sentences Ys in the pivot
are obtained referring the source-pivot dictionary
for a word xs. After that, a description sentence
ys E Ys in the pivot is converted to a set of de-
scription sentences Zs in the destination referring
the pivot-destination dictionary. A co-occurrence
vector against a candidate description sentence zs =
z1sz2s · · · zls, which is an instance of Zs, is calculated
by this equation:

Finally, the candidate zs which meets a certain
condition is selected as an output. Two conditions
are examined in this paper: (1) selecting top-n can-
didates from sorted ones according to each similarity
score, and (2) selecting candidates whose similarity
scores are greater than a certain threshold. In this pa-
per, cosine distance s(vt(xs), u(zs)) between avec-

Because almost of novel words are nouns, these researches focus into the task of translating nouns. In the expansion task, however, it is necessary to translate verbs and adjectives as well as nouns, because a seed dictionary will be so small that only basic words will be contained in it if the target language pair is unfamiliar. We will discuss about this topic in Section 3.2. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the method to expand a small seed dictionary. The experiments presented in Section 3 shows that the proposed method can improve performance of a</context>
