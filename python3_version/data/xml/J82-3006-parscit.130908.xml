4. There shall be a Nominating Committee consist-
ing of three members, who shall serve for three
years, one elected each year. The member whose
term is about to expire shall chair the Committee.
5. Elections shall be conducted as follows: the Nom-
inating Committee shall nominate one person for

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977948529411765">
A conference on Applied Natural Language Proc-
essing, sponsored by the Association for Computation-
al Linguistics and the Naval Research Laboratory, will
be held Tuesday, February 1, through Thursday, Feb-
ruary 3, 1983, at the Miramar-Sheraton Hotel in Santa
Monica, California. This special conference will focus
on the use of computational linguistic techniques to
solve real world problems. The conference will be
limited to 300 participants. In addition to presenta-
tions of technical papers, there will be demonstrations
of working systems and exhibits of special purpose
processors, tools and other materials that support nat-
ural language processing. In conjunction with the
conference, a tutorial program will be offered on Mon-
day, January 31. The conference committee consists
of Iris Kameny (General Chair), System Development
Corporation; Beatrice Oshika (Program Chair), System
