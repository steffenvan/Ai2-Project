Abstract

We proposed a method of machine transla-
tion using inductive learning with genetic
algorithms, and confirmed the effectiveness
of applying genetic algorithms. However,
the system based on this method produces
many erroneous translation rules that can-
not be completely removed from the dictio-
nary. Therefore, we need to improve how
to apply genetic algorithms to be able to re-
move erroneous translation rules from the
dictionary. In this paper, we describe this
improvement in the selection process and
the results of evaluation experiments.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999385">
Many studies have been carried out on machine
translation and a number of problems has been rec-
ognized. Rule-based machine translation (Hutchins
and Somers, 1992) could not deal adequately with
various linguistic phenomena due to the use of lim-
ited rules. To resolve this problem, Example-based
machine translation (Sato and Nagao, 1990) has re-
cently been proposed. However, this method re-
quires many translation examples to achieve a prac-
tical and high-quality translation.
Echizen-ya and others previously proposed a
method of Machine Translation using Inductive
Learning with Genetic Algorithms (GA-ILMT), and
this method has been evaluated(Echizen-ya et al.,
1996). By applying genetic algorithms, we consider
that our proposed method can effectively solve prob-
lems that Example-based machine translation would
require many translation examples. However, the
results of the evaluation experiments show that this
method has some problems. The main problem is
that many erroneous translation rules are produced
and these rules cannot be completely removed from
the dictionary. Therefore, we need to improve how
to apply genetic algorithms to be able to remove
erroneous translation rules. In this paper, we de-
scribe an improvement in the selection process of
GA-ILMT, and confirm the effectiveness of improve-
ment in the selection process of GA-ILMT.

2 Outline of Translation Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999341866666667">
Figure 1 shows the outline of our proposed transla-
tion method. First, the user inputs a source sentence
in English. Second, in the translation process, the
system produces several candidates of translation re-
sults using translation rules extracted in the learn-
ing process. Third, the user proofreads the trans-
lated sentences if they include some errors. Fourth,
in the feedback process, the system determines the
fitness value of translation rules used in the transla-
tion process and performs the selection process of
erroneous translation rules. In the learning pro-
cess, new translation examples are automatically
produced by crossover and mutation, and various
translation rules are extracted from the translation
examples by inductive learning.

translation rules cannot be completely removed from
the dictionary.
To resolve this problem, we propose an improve-
ment in the selection process. Our proposed im-
provement does not require any analytical knowl-
edge as initial condition. Methods that use analyti-
cal knowledge have some problems, such as difficulty
in dealing with unregistered words. We consider
that this problem can be resolved by the learning
method without any analytical knowledge. There-
fore, we consider that our proposed improvement
can remove many erroneous translation rules by uti-
lizing only the given translation examples without
the requirement of analytical knowledge.
The system evaluates the translation rules by
utilizing the given translation examples directly.
Namely, it determines whether a combination of the
English word and the Japanese word in a translation
rule is true or false by utilizing the given translation
examples. The combination may be true when it ex-
ists in a given translation example. For example, the
combination of words which are &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; in English and
&amp;quot;Watashil (In Japanese &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;)&amp;quot; in Japanese is true
when this combination exists in a given translation
example. On the other hand, the combination of
words which are &amp;quot;volleyball&amp;quot; in English and &amp;quot;Ba-
sukettoboru(In Japanese &amp;quot;basketball&amp;quot;)&amp;quot; in Japanese
is false when this combination does not exist in all
given translation examples. In the all combinations
of words in a translation rule, the system determines
whether the each combination of words is true or
false. And the system determines the rate of error
based on the number of erroneous combinations, and
removes the translation rules for which the rate of
error is high.

4 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9616505">
In the experiments, 461 translation examples were
used as data. The examples were taken from a text-
book (Hasegawa et al., 1991) for first-grade junior
&apos;Italic means pronunciation of Japanese
high school students. All of the translation exam-
ples were processed by the method outlined in Fig-
ure 1. The initial dictionary was empty. The exper-
iments were carried out with and without the im-
provement for the selection process described in Sec-
tion 3. In the experiments, the precision increased
from 87.5% to 93.7% and the recall increased from
4.5% to 56.0%.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997135">
In the previous selection process, the translation
rules are evaluated only when they are used in the
translation process. Therefore, the translation rules
which are not used in the translation process are
never removed from the dictionary. However, the
proposed improvement can evaluate all of the pro-
duced translation rules by utilizing only the given
translation examples.
