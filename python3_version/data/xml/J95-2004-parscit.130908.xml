Stochastic approaches to natural language processing have often been preferred to rule-based
approaches because of their robustness and their automatic training capabilities. This was the
case for part-of-speech tagging until Brill showed how state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagging can
be achieved with a rule-based tagger by inferring rules from a training corpus. However, current
implementations of the rule-based tagger run more slowly than previous approaches. In this
paper, we present a finite-state tagger, inspired by the rule-based tagger, that operates in optimal
time in the sense that the time to assign tags to a sentence corresponds to the time required to
follow a single path in a deterministic finite-state machine. This result is achieved by encoding
the application of the rules found in the tagger as a nondeterministic finite-state transducer and
then turning it into a deterministic transducer. The resulting deterministic transducer yields a
part-of-speech tagger whose speed is dominated by the access time of mass storage devices. We
then generalize the techniques to the class of transformation-based systems.

Finite-state devices have important applications to many areas of computer science, in-
cluding pattern matching, databases, and compiler technology. Although their linguis-
tic adequacy to natural language processing has been questioned in the past (Chomsky,
1964), there has recently been a dramatic renewal of interest in the application of finite-
state devices to several aspects of natural language processing. This renewal of interest
is due to the speed and compactness of finite-state representations. This efficiency is ex-
plained by two properties: finite-state devices can be made deterministic, and they can
be turned into a minimal form. Such representations have been successfully applied to
different aspects of natural language processing, such as morphological analysis and
generation (Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992; Clemenceau 1993), parsing (Roche
1993; Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1993), phonology (Laporte 1993; Kaplan and Kay
1994) and speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994). Although finite-state
machines have been used for part-of-speech tagging (Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1993;
Silberztein 1993), none of these approaches has the same flexibility as stochastic tech-
niques. Unlike stochastic approaches to part-of-speech tagging (Church 1988; Kupiec
1992; Cutting et al. 1992; Merialdo 1990; DeRose 1988; Weischedel et al. 1993), up to
now the knowledge found in finite-state taggers has been handcrafted and was not
automatically acquired.
Recently, Brill (1992) described a rule-based tagger that performs as well as taggers
based upon probabilistic models and overcomes the limitations common in rule-based
approaches to language processing: it is robust and the rules are automatically ac-

quired. In addition, the tagger requires drastically less space than stochastic taggers.
However, current implementations of Brill&apos;s tagger are considerably slower than the
ones based on probabilistic models since it may require RKn elementary steps to tag
an input of n words with R rules requiring at most K tokens of context.
Although the speed of current part-of-speech taggers is acceptable for interac-
tive systems where a sentence at a time is being processed, it is not adequate for
applications where large bodies of text need to be tagged, such as in information re-
trieval, indexing applications, and grammar-checking systems. Furthermore, the space
required for part-of-speech taggers is also an issue in commercial personal computer
applications such as grammar-checking systems. In addition, part-of-speech taggers
are often being coupled with a syntactic analysis module. Usually these two modules
are written in different frameworks, making it very difficult to integrate interactions
between the two modules.
In this paper, we design a tagger that requires n steps to tag a sentence of length
n, independently of the number of rules and the length of the context they require.
The tagger is represented by a finite-state transducer, a framework that can also be
the basis for syntactic analysis. This finite-state tagger will also be found useful when
combined with other language components, since it can be naturally extended by
composing it with finite-state transducers that could encode other aspects of natural
language syntax.
Relying on algorithms and formal characterizations described in later sections, we
explain how each rule in Brill&apos;s tagger can be viewed as a nondeterministic finite-state
transducer. We also show how the application of all rules in Brill&apos;s tagger is achieved
by composing each of these nondeterministic transducers and why nondeterminism
arises in this transducer. We then prove the correctness of the general algorithm for
determinizing (whenever possible) finite-state transducers, and we successfully apply
this algorithm to the previously obtained nondeterministic transducer. The resulting
deterministic transducer yields a part-of-speech tagger that operates in optimal time
in the sense that the time to assign tags to a sentence corresponds to the time required
to follow a single path in this deterministic finite-state machine. We also show how
the lexicon used by the tagger can be optimally encoded using a finite-state machine.
The techniques used for the construction of the finite-state tagger are then for-
malized and mathematically proven correct. We introduce a proof of soundness and
completeness with a worst-case complexity analysis for the algorithm for determiniz-
ing finite-state transducers.
We conclude by proving that the method can be applied to the class of transformation-
based error-driven systems.

2. Overview of Brill&apos;s Tagger
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999333125">
Brill&apos;s tagger is comprised of three parts, each of which is inferred from a training cor-
pus: a lexical tagger, an unknown word tagger, and a contextual tagger. For purposes
of exposition, we will postpone the discussion of the unknown word tagger and focus
mainly on the contextual rule tagger, which is the core of the tagger.
The lexical tagger initially tags each word with its most likely tag, estimated by
examining a large tagged corpus, without regard to context. For example, assuming
that vbn is the most likely tag for the word &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; and vbd for &amp;quot;shot,&amp;quot; the lexical
tagger might assign the following part-of-speech tags:&apos;

Since the lexical tagger does not use any contextual information, many words can
be tagged incorrectly. For example, in (1), the word &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; is erroneously tagged as
a verb in past participle form, and in (2), &amp;quot;shot&amp;quot; is incorrectly tagged as a verb in past
tense.
Given the initial tagging obtained by the lexical tagger, the contextual tagger ap-
plies a sequence of rules in order and attempts to remedy the errors made by the initial
tagging. For example, the rules in Figure 1 might be found in a contextual tagger.
The first rule says to change tag vbn to vbd if the previous tag is np. The second
rule says to change vbd to tag vbn if the next tag is by. Once the first rule is applied,
the tag for &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot; in (1) and (3) is changed from vbn to vbd and the following tagged
sentences are obtained:

And once the second rule is applied, the tag for &amp;quot;shot&amp;quot; in (5) is changed from vbd

It is relevant to our following discussion to note that the application of the NEXT-
TAG rule must look ahead one token in the sentence before it can be applied, and that
the application of two rules may perform a series of operations resulting in no net
change. As we will see in the next section, these two aspects are the source of local
nondeterminism in Brill&apos;s tagger.
The sequence of contextual rules is automatically inferred from a training corpus.
A list of tagging errors (with their counts) is compiled by comparing the output of
the lexical tagger to the correct part-of-speech assignment. Then, for each error, it is
determined which instantiation of a set of rule templates results in the greatest error
reduction. Then the set of new errors caused by applying the rule is computed and
the process is repeated until the error reduction drops below a given threshold.

Using the set of contextual rule templates shown in Figure 2, after training on
the Brown Corpus, 280 contextual rules are obtained. The resulting rule-based tagger
performs as well as state-of-the-art taggers based upon probabilistic models. It also
overcomes the limitations common in rule-based approaches to language processing:
it is robust, and the rules are automatically acquired. In addition, the tagger requires
drastically less space than stochastic taggers. However, as we will see in the next
section, Brill&apos;s tagger is inherently slow.

3. Complexity of Brill&apos;s Tagger
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998788842105263">
Once the lexical assignment is performed, in Brill&apos;s algorithm, each contextual rule
acquired during the training phase is applied to each sentence to be tagged. For each
individual rule, the algorithm scans the input from left to right while attempting to
match the rule.
This simple algorithm is computationally inefficient for two reasons. The first rea-
son for inefficiency is the fact that an individual rule is compared at each token of the
input, regardless of the fact that some of the current tokens may have been previously
examined when matching the same rule at a previous position. The algorithm treats
each rule as a template of tags and slides it along the input, one word at a time.
Consider, for example, the rule A B PREVBIGRAM C C that changes tag A to tag B if
the previous two tags are C.
When applied to the input CDCCA, the pattern CCA is compared three times to
the input, as shown in Figure 3. At each step no record of previous partial matches
or mismatches is remembered. In this example, C is compared with the second input
token D during the first and second steps, and therefore, the second step could have
been skipped by remembering the comparisons from the first step. This method is
similar to a naive pattern-matching algorithm.
The second reason for inefficiency is the potential interaction between rules. For
example, when the rules in Figure 1 are applied to sentence (3), the first rule results

in a change (6) that is undone by the second rule as shown in (9). The algorithm may
therefore perform unnecessary computation.
In summary, Brill&apos;s algorithm for implementing the contextual tagger may require
RKn elementary steps to tag an input of n words with R contextual rules requiring at
most K tokens of context.

4. Construction of the Finite-State Tagger
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998218692307692">
We show how the function represented by each contextual rule can be represented
as a nondeterministic finite-state transducer and how the sequential application of
each contextual rule also corresponds to a nondeterministic finite-state transducer
being the result of the composition of each individual transducer. We will then turn
the nondeterministic transducer into a deterministic transducer. The resulting part-
of-speech tagger operates in linear time independent of the number of rules and the
length of the context. The new tagger operates in optimal time in the sense that the
time to assign tags to a sentence corresponds to the time required to follow a single
path in the resulting deterministic finite-state machine.
Our work relies on two central notions: the notion of a finite-state transducer and
the notion of a subsequential transducer. Informally speaking, a finite-state transducer
is a finite-state automaton whose transitions are labeled by pairs of symbols. The first
symbol is the input and the second is the output. Applying a finite-state transducer to
an input consists of following a path according to the input symbols while storing the
output symbols, the result being the sequence of output symbols stored. Section 8.1
formally defines the notion of transducer.
Finite-state transducers can be composed, intersected, merged with the union op-
eration and sometimes determinized. Basically, one can manipulate finite-state trans-
ducers as easily as finite-state automata. However, whereas every finite-state automa-
ton is equivalent to some deterministic finite-state automaton, there are finite-state
transducers that are not equivalent to any deterministic finite-state transducer. Trans-
ductions that can be computed by some deterministic finite-state transducer are called
subsequential functions. We will see that the final step of the compilation of our tag-
ger consists of transforming a finite-state transducer into an equivalent subsequential
transducer.
We will use the following notation when pictorially describing a finite-state trans-
ducer: final states are depicted with two concentric circles; c represents the empty
string; on a transition from state i to state j, a/b indicates a transition on input symbol
a and output symbol(s) b;2 a question mark (?) on an input transition (for example
labeled ?/b) originating at state i stands for any input symbol that does not appear as
input symbol on any other outgoing arc from i. In this document, each depicted finite-
state transducer will be assumed to have a single initial state, namely the leftmost
state (usually labeled 0).
We are now ready to construct the tagger. Given a set of rules, the tagger is
constructed in four steps.
The first step consists of turning each contextual rule found in Brill&apos;s tagger into a
finite-state transducer. Following the example discussed in Section 2, the functionality
of the rule vbn vbd PREVTAG np is represented by the transducer shown on the left of
Figure 4.

Each contextual rule is defined locally; that is, the transformation it describes must
be applied at each position of the input sequence. For instance, the rule
A B PREV10R2TAG C,
which changes A into B if the previous tag or the one before is C, must be applied
twice on CA A (resulting in the output C B B). As we have seen in the previous section,
this method is not efficient.
The second step consists of turning the transducers produced by the preceding step
into transducers that operate globally on the input in one pass. This transformation
is performed for each transducer associated with each rule. Given a function fi that
transforms, say, a into b (i.e. fi (a) =- b), we want to extend it to a function f2 such
that f2 (w) = w&apos; where w&apos; is the word built from the word w where each occurrence
of a has been replaced by b. We say that 12 is the local extension&apos; of Ii, and we write
f2 LocExt(fi). Section 8.2 formally defines this notion and gives an algorithm for
computing the local extension.
Referring to the example of Section 2, the local extension of the transducer for the
rule vbn vbd PREVTAG np is shown to the right of Figure 4. Similarly, the transducer for
the contextual rule vbd vbn NEXTTAG by and its local extension are shown in Figure 5.
The transducers obtained in the previous step still need to be applied one after
the other.

The third step combines all transducers into one single transducer. This corre-
sponds to the formal operation of composition defined on transducers. The formaliza-
tion of this notion and an algorithm for computing the composed transducer are well
known and are described originally by Elgot and Mezei (1965).
Returning to our running example of Section 2, the transducer obtained by com-
posing the local extension of T2 (right in Figure 5) with the local extension of T1 (right
in Figure 4) is shown in Figure 6.
The fourth and final step consists of transforming the finite-state transducer ob-
tained in the previous step into an equivalent subsequential (deterministic) transducer.
The transducer obtained in the previous step may contain some nondeterminism. The
fourth step tries to turn it into a deterministic machine. This determinization is not al-
ways possible for any given finite-state transducer. For example, the transducer shown
in Figure 7 is not equivalent to any subsequential transducer. Intuitively speaking, this
transducer has to look ahead an unbounded distance in order to correctly generate
the output. This intuition will be formalized in Section 9.2.
However, as proven in Section 10, the rules inferred in Brill&apos;s tagger can always
be turned into a deterministic machine. Section 9.1 describes an algorithm for deter-
minizing finite-state transducers. This algorithm will not terminate when applied to
transducers representing nonsubsequential functions.
In our running example, the transducer in Figure 6 has some nondeterministic
paths. For example, from state 0 on input symbol vbd, two possible emissions are
possible: vbn (from 0 to 2) and vbd (from 0 to 3). This nondeterminism is due to the
rule vbd vbn NEXTTAG by, since this rule has to read the second symbol before it can
know which symbol must be emitted. The deterministic version of the transducer T3 is
shown in Figure 8. Whenever nondeterminism arises in T3, the deterministic machine

emits the empty symbol e, and postpones the emission of the output symbol. For
example, from the start state 0, the empty string is emitted on input vbd, while the
current state is set to 2. If the following word is by, the two token string vbn by is
emitted (from 2 to 0), otherwise vbd is emitted (depending on the input from 2 to 2 or
from 2 to 0).
Using an appropriate implementation for finite-state transducers (see Section 11),
the resulting part-of-speech tagger operates in linear time, independently of the num-
ber of rules and the length of the context. The new tagger therefore operates in optimal
time.
We have shown how the contextual rules can be implemented very efficiently. We
now turn our attention to lexical assignment, the step that precedes the application of
the contextual transducer. This step can also be made very efficient.

5. Lexical Tagger
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999839823529412">
The first step of the tagging process consists of looking up each word in a dictionary.
Since the dictionary is the largest part of the tagger in terms of space, a compact rep-
resentation is crucial. Moreover, the lookup process has to be very fast too otherwise
the improvement in speed of the contextual manipulations would be of little practical
interest.
To achieve high speed for this procedure, the dictionary is represented by a deter-
ministic finite-state automaton with both fast access and small storage space. Suppose
one wants to encode the sample dictionary of Figure 9. The algorithm, as described by
Revuz (1991), consists of first building a tree whose branches are labeled by letters and
whose leaves are labeled by a list of tags (such as nn vb) , and then minimizing it into
a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The result of applying this procedure to the sample
dictionary of Figure 9 is the DAG of Figure 10. When a dictionary is represented as
a DAG, looking up a word in it consists simply of following one path in the DAG.
The complexity of the lookup procedure depends only on the length of the word; in
particular, it is independent of the size of the dictionary.
The lexicon used in our system encodes 54,000 words. The corresponding DAG
takes 360Kb of space and provides an access time of 12,000 words per second.&apos;

The rule-based system described by Brill (1992) contains a module that operates after
all known words—that is, words listed in the dictionary—have been tagged with their
most frequent tag, and before contextual rules are applied. This module guesses a
tag for a word according to its suffix (e.g. a word with an &amp;quot;ing&amp;quot; suffix is likely to be
a verb), its prefix (e.g. a word starting with an uppercase character is likely to be a
proper noun), and other relevant properties.
This module basically follows the same techniques as the ones used to implement
the lexicon. Because of the similarity of the methods used, we do not provide further
details about this module.

The tagger we constructed has an accuracy identical&apos; to Brill&apos;s tagger and comparable
to statistical-based methods. However, it runs at a much higher speed. The tagger
runs nearly ten times faster than the fastest of the other systems. Moreover, the finite-
state tagger inherits from the rule-based system its compactness compared with a
stochastic tagger. In fact, whereas stochastic taggers have to store word-tag, bigram,
and trigram probabilities, the rule-based tagger and therefore the finite-state one only
have to encode a small number of rules (between 200 and 300).
We empirically compared our tagger with Eric Brill&apos;s implementation of his tagger,
and with our implementation of a trigram tagger adapted from the work of Church
(1988) that we previously implemented for another purpose. We ran the three programs
on large files and piped their output into a file. In the times reported, we included
the time spent reading the input and writing the output. Figure 11 summarizes the
results. All taggers were trained on a portion of the Brown corpus. The experiments
were run on an HP720 with 32MB of memory. In order to conduct a fair comparison,
the dictionary lookup part of the stochastic tagger has also been implemented using
the techniques described in Section 5. All three taggers have approximately the same

However, the tagger could be extended to include recent improvements described in more recent

precision (95% of the tags are correct).6 By design, the finite-state tagger produces
the same output as the rule-based tagger. The rule-based tagger—and the finite-state
tagger—do not always produce the exact same tagging as the stochastic tagger (they do
not make the same errors); however, no significant difference in performance between
the systems was detected.&apos;
Independently, Cutting et al. (1992) quote a performance of 800 words per second
for their part-of-speech tagger based on hidden Markov models.
The space required by the finite-state tagger (815KB) is distributed as follows:
363KB for the dictionary, 440KB for the subsequential transducer and 12KB for the
module for unknown words.
The speeds of the different parts of our system are shown in Figure 12.8
Our system reaches a performance level in speed for which other, very low-level
factors (such as storage access) may dominate the computation. At such speeds, the
time spent reading the input file, breaking the file into sentences, breaking the sen-
tences into words, and writing the result into a file is no longer negligible.
8. Finite-State Transducers
The methods used in the construction of the finite-state tagger described in the previ-
ous sections were described informally. In the following section, the notion of finite-
state transducer and the notion of local extension are defined. We also provide an
algorithm for computing the local extension of a finite-state transducer. Issues related
to the determinization of finite-state transducers are discussed in the section following
this one.

A finite-state transducer T is a five-tuple (E, Q, i,F,E) where: E is a finite alphabet; Q is
a finite set of states or vertices; i E Q is the initial state; F C Q is the set of final states;
ECQx (E U {€}) x E* x Q is the set of edges or transitions.

6 For evaluation purposes, we randomly selected 90% of the Brown corpus for training purposes and
10% for testing.
7 An extended discussion of the precision of the rule-based tagger can be found in Brill (1992).
8 In Figure 12, the dictionary lookup includes reading the file, splitting it into sentences, looking up each
word in the dictionary, and writing the final result to a file. The dictionary lookup and the tagging of
unknown words take roughly the same amount of time, but since the second procedure only applies
on unknown words (around 10% in our experiments), the percentage of time it takes is much smaller.

<bodyText confidence="0.942402333333333">
A finite-state transducer T also defines a function on words in the following way:
the extended set of edges E, the transitive closure of E, is defined by the following
recursive relation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996946">
• if e E E then e E
• if (q, a, b, q&apos;), (qc a&apos; , q&amp;quot;) E t then (q, aa&apos; bb&apos; q&amp;quot;) E E.

<bodyText confidence="0.977744892857143">
Then the function f from E* to E* defined by f (w) = w&apos; iff q E F such that (i, w, w&apos; , q) E
E is the function defined by T. One says that T represents f and writes f = 11.
The functions on words that are represented by finite-state transducers are called
rational functions. If, for some input w, more than one output is allowed (e.g. f (w) =
{w1, w2, .}) then f is called a rational transduction.
In the example of Figure 13, 1E11 is defined by ILII(ah) -= bh and I T41(ae) = ce.
Given a finite-state transducer T = (E, Q, F, E), the following additional notions
are useful: its state transition function d that maps Q x (E u {€}) into 2Q defined by
d(q, a) = {q&apos; E Q ]w&apos; E E* and (q, a, w&apos; , q&apos;) E E}; and its emission function 5 that maps
Q x (E U {c}) x Q into 2E* defined by (q , a, q&apos;) = {w&apos; E E I (q, a, w,&apos; q&apos;) E E}.
A finite-state transducer could be seen as a finite-state automaton, where each
transition label is a pair. In this respect, T4 would be deterministic; however, since
transducers are generally used to compute a function, a more relevant definition
of determinism consists of saying that both the transition function d and the emis-
sion function (5 lead to sets containing at most one element, that is, Id(q, a)1 &lt; 1 and
18 (q , a, (3&apos;)I &lt; 1 (and that these sets are empty for a = e). With this notion, if a finite-state
transducer is deterministic, one can apply the function to a given word by determin-
istically following a single path in the transducer. Deterministic transducers are called
subsequential transducers (Schfitzenberger 1977).9 Given a deterministic transducer, we
can define the partial functions q 0a = q&apos; iff d(q, a) -= {q&apos;} and q * a = w&apos; iff E Q such
that q 0 a = q&apos; and 6 (q , a, q&apos;) = {w&apos;} . This leads to the definition of subsequential trans-
ducers: a subsequential transducer T&apos; is a seven-tuple (E, Q, i, F, 0, *, p) where: E, Q, i, F
are defined as above; 0 is the deterministic state transition function that maps Q x E
on Q, one writes q Oa = q&apos;; * is the deterministic emission function that maps Q x E on
E*, one writes q * a = w&apos;; and the final emission function p maps F on E*, one writes
p(q) = w.
For instance, T4 is not deterministic because d(0, a) =- {1,2}, but it is equivalent
to Ty represented Figure 14 in the sense that they represent the same function, i.e.

In this section, we will see how a function that needs to be applied at all input positions
can be transformed into a global function that needs to be applied once on the input.
For instance, consider T6 of Figure 15. It represents the function f6 = IT61 such that
f6 (ab) -= bc and f6 (bca) = dca. We want to build the function that, given a word w, each
time w contains ab (i.e. ab is a factor of the word) (resp. bca), this factor is transformed
into its image bc (resp. dca). Suppose, for instance, that the input word is w = aabcab, as
shown in Figure 16, and that the factors that are in dom(f6)1° can be found according
to two different factorizations: i.e. w1 = a • w2 • C &apos; w211, where w2 = ab, and wi =
aa • w3 • b, where w3 = bca. The local extension of f6 will be the transduction that takes
each possible factorization and transforms each factor according to f6, i.e. f6 (w2)=
bc and f6(w3) = dca, and leaves the other parts unchanged; here this leads to two
outputs: abccbc according to the first factorization, and aadcab according to the second
factorization.
The notion of local extension is formalized through the following definition.

Intuitively, if F = LocExt(f) and w E E*, each factor of w in dom(f) is transformed
into its image by f and the remaining part of w is left unchanged. If f is represented
by a finite-state transducer T and LocExt(f) is represented by a finite-state transducer
T&apos;, one writes T&apos; = LocExt(T).
It could also be seen that if -y7- is the identity function on E* — (E* • dom(T) • E*),
then LocExt(T) =- (T -y7-)*.12 Figure 17 gives an algorithm that computes the local
extension directly.
The idea is that an input word is processed nondeterministically from left to right.
Suppose, for instance, that we have the initial transducer T7 of Figure 18 and that we
want to build its local extension, T8 of Figure 19.
When the input is read, if a current input letter cannot be transformed at the
initial state of T7 (the letter c for instance), it is left unchanged: this is expressed by

if the input symbol, say a, can be processed at the initial state of T7, one doesn&apos;t
know yet whether a will be the beginning of a word that can be transformed (e.g. ab)
or whether it will be followed by a sequence that makes it impossible to apply the
transformation (e.g. ac). Hence one has to entertain two possibilities, namely (1) we
are processing the input according to T7 and the transitions should be a/b; or (2) we
are within the identity and the transition should be a/a. This leads to two kind of
states: the transduction states (marked transduction in the algorithm) and the identity
states (marked identity in the algorithm). It can be seen in Figure 19 that this leads
to a transducer that has a copy of the initial transducer and an additional part that
processes the identity while making sure it could not have been transformed. In other
words, the algorithm consists of building a copy of the original transducer and at the
same time the identity function that operates on E* — E* • dom(T) • E*.
Let us now see how the algorithm of Figure 17 applies step by step to the trans-
ducer T7 of Figure 18, producing the transducer T8 of Figure 19.
In Figure 17, C&apos; [0] = ({i}, identity) of line 1 states that state 0 of the transducer to
be built is of type identity and refers to the initial state i = 0 of T7. q represents the
current state and n the current number of states. In the loop do{. •} while (q &lt; n), one
builds the transitions of each state one after the other: if the transition points to a state
not already built, a new state is added, thus incrementing n. The program stops when
all states have been inspected and when no additional state is created. The number of
iterations is bounded by 211 TII*2, where TI = IQ&apos; is the number of states of the original
transducer.&amp;quot; Line 3 says that the current state within the loop is q and that this state

refers to the set of states S and is marked by the type type. In our example, at the
first occurrence of this line, S is instantiated to {0} and type = identity. Line 5 adds
the current identity state to the set of final states and a transition to the initial state
for all letters that do not appear on any outgoing arc from this state. Lines 6-11 build
the transitions from and to the identity states, keeping track of where this leads in the
original transducer. For instance, a is a label that verifies the conditions of line 6. Thus
a transition a/a is to be added to the identity state 2, which refers to 1 (because of the
transition a/b of T7) and to i 0 (because it is possible to start the transduction T7
from any identity state). Line 7 checks that this state doesn&apos;t already exist and adds it
if necessary. e -= n++ means that the arrival state for this transition, i.e. d(q, w), will be
the last added state and that the number of states being built has to be incremented.
Line 11 actually builds the transition between 0 and e = 2 labeled a/a. Lines 12-17
describe the fact that it is possible to start a transduction from any identity state. Here
a transition is added to a new state, i.e. a/b to 3. The next state to be considered is 2
and it is built like state 0, except that the symbol b should block the current output. In
fact, state 1 means that we already read a with a as output; thus, if one reads b, ab is
at the current point, and since ab should be transformed into bc, the current identity
transformation (that is a —&gt; a) should be blocked: this is expressed by the transition b/b
that leads to state 1 (this state is a &amp;quot;trash&amp;quot; state; that is, it has no outgoing transition
and it is not final).
The following state is 3, which is marked as being of type transduction, which
means that lines 19-27 should be applied. This consists simply of copying the transi-
tions of the original transducer. If the original state was final, as for 4 -= ({2}, transduction),
an €/e transition to the initial state is added (to get the behavior of T+).
The transducer T9 = LOCEXt(T6) of Figure 20 gives a more complete (and slightly
more complex) example of this algorithm.

Although it is decidable whether a function is subsequential or not (Choffrut 1977),
the determinization algorithm described in the previous section does not terminate
when run on a nonsubsequential function.
Two issues are addressed in this section. First, the proof of soundness: the fact that
if the algorithm terminates, then the output transducer is deterministic and represents
the same function. Second, the proof of completeness: the algorithm terminates in the
case of subsequential functions.
Soundness and completeness are a consequence of the main proposition, which
states that if a transducer T represents a subsequential function f, then the algorithm
DeterminizeTransducer described in the previous section applied on T computes a sub-
sequential transducer representing the same function.

10. Subsequentiality of Transformation-Based Systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99864">
The proof of correctness of the determinization algorithm and the fact that the algo-
rithm terminates on the transducer encoding Brill&apos;s tagger show that the final function
is subsequential and equivalent to Brill&apos;s original tagger.
In this section, we prove in general that any transformation-based system, such as
those used by Brill, is a subsequential function. In other words, any transformation-
based system can be turned into a deterministic finite-state transducer.
We define transformation-based systems as follows.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.695066" genericHeader="method">
Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919181818182">
A transformation-based system is a finite sequence (fi, fn) of subsequential func-
tions whose domains are bounded.
Applying a transformation-based system consists of applying each function f, one
after the other. Applying one function consists of looking for the first position in
the input at which the function can be triggered. When the function is triggered,
the longest possible string starting at that position is transformed according to this
function. After the string is transformed, the process is iterated starting at the end of
the previously transformed string. Then, the next function is applied. The program
ends when all functions have been applied.
It is not true that, in general, the local extension of a subsequential function is
subsequential.&apos; For instance, consider the function fa of Figure 23.

The local extension of the function f, is not a function. In fact, consider the input
string daaaad; it can be decomposed either into d • aaa ad or into da • aaa d. The first
decomposition leads to the output dbbbad, and the second one to the output dabbbd.
The intended use of the rules in the tagger defined by Brill is to apply each
function from left to right. In addition, if several decompositions are possible, the one
that occurs first is the one chosen. In our previous example, it means that only the
output dbbbad is generated.
This notion is now defined precisely.
Let a be the rational function defined by a(a) = a for a E E, a(I) = a(I) = c on the

We also have A&amp;quot;w&amp;quot; = A1A;A&apos;3 with a(Al2) = a(A2) and the first letter of A/2 is different

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989769230769">
Once the final finite-state transducer is computed, applying it to an input is straight-
forward: it consists of following the unique sequence of transitions whose left labels
correspond to the input. However, in order to have a complexity fully independent of
the size of the grammar and in particular independent of the number of transitions
at each state, one should carefully choose an appropriate representation for the trans-
ducer. In our implementation, transitions can be accessed randomly. The transducer
is first represented by a two-dimensional table whose rows are indexed by states and
whose columns are indexed by the alphabet of all possible input letters. The content
of the table at line q and at column a is the word w such that the transition from q
with the input label a outputs w. Since only a few transitions are allowed from many
states, this table is very sparse and can be compressed. This compression is achieved
while maintaining random access using a procedure for sparse data tables following
the method given by Tarjan and Yao (1979).

The techniques described in this paper are more general than the problem of part-of-
speech tagging and are applicable to the class of problems dealing with local transfor-
mation rules.
We showed that any transformation-based program can be transformed into a
deterministic finite-state transducer. This yields to optimal time implementations of
transformation based programs.
As a case study, we applied these techniques to the problem of part-of-speech
tagging and presented a finite-state tagger that requires n steps to tag a sentence of
length n, independently of the number of rules and the length of the context they
require. We achieved this result by representing the rules acquired for Brill&apos;s tagger
as nondeterministic finite-state transducers. We composed each of these nondetermin-
istic transducers and turned the resulting transducer into a deterministic transducer.
The resulting deterministic transducer yields a part-of-speech tagger that operates in
optimal time in the sense that the time to assign tags to a sentence corresponds to
the time required to follow a single path in this deterministic finite-state machine. The

tagger outperforms in speed both Brill&apos;s tagger and stochastic taggers. Moreover, the
finite-state tagger inherits from the rule-based system its compactness compared with
stochastic taggers. We also proved the correctness and the generality of the methods.
We believe that this finite-state tagger will also be found useful when combined
with other language components, since it can be naturally extended by composing
it with finite-state transducers that could encode other aspects of natural language
syntax.

<abstract confidence="0.997530333333333">Stochastic approaches to natural language processing have often been preferred to rule-based approaches because of their robustness and their automatic training capabilities. This was the case for part-of-speech tagging until Brill showed how state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagging can be achieved with a rule-based tagger by inferring rules from a training corpus. However, current implementations of the rule-based tagger run more slowly than previous approaches. In this paper, we present a finite-state tagger, inspired by the rule-based tagger, that operates in optimal time in the sense that the time to assign tags to a sentence corresponds to the time required to follow a single path in a deterministic finite-state machine. This result is achieved by encoding the application of the rules found in the tagger as a nondeterministic finite-state transducer and then turning it into a deterministic transducer. The resulting deterministic transducer yields a part-of-speech tagger whose speed is dominated by the access time of mass storage devices. We then generalize the techniques to the class of transformation-based systems.</abstract>

This module guesses a tag for a word according to its suffix (e.g. a word with an &amp;quot;ing&amp;quot; suffix is likely to be a verb), its prefix (e.g. a word starting with an uppercase character is likely to be a proper noun), and other relevant properties.

The dictionary lookup and the tagging of unknown words take roughly the same amount of time, but since the second procedure only applies on unknown words (around 10% in our experiments), the percentage of time it takes is much smaller. 236 Emmanuel Roche and Yves Schabes Deterministic Part-of-Speech Tagging Figure 13 T4: Example of a finite-state transducer.

Two issues are addressed in this section. First, the proof of soundness: the fact that if the algorithm terminates, then the output transducer is deterministic and represents the same function.

Introduction Finite-state devices have important applications to many areas of computer science, including pattern matching, databases, and compiler technology. Although their linguistic adequacy to natural language processing has been questioned in the past (Chomsky, 1964), there has recently been a dramatic renewal of interest in the application of finitestate devices to several aspects of natural language processing. This renewal of interest is due to the speed and compactness of finite-state representations. This efficiency is explained by two properties: finite-state devices can be made deterministic, and they can be turned into a minimal form. Such representations have been successfully applied to different aspects of natural language processing, such as morphological analysis and generation (Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992; Clemenceau 1993), parsing (R</context>

The tagger runs nearly ten times faster than the fastest of the other systems. Moreover, the finitestate tagger inherits from the rule-based system its compactness compared with a stochastic tagger. In fact, whereas stochastic taggers have to store word-tag, bigram, and trigram probabilities, the rule-based tagger and therefore the finite-state one only have to encode a small number of rules (between 200 and 300). We empirically compared our tagger with Eric Brill&apos;s implementation of his tagger, and with our implementation of a trigram tagger adapted from the work of Church (1988) that we previously implemented for another purpose. We ran the three programs on large files and piped their output into a file. In the times reported, we included the time spent reading the input and writing the output.

Such representations have been successfully applied to different aspects of natural language processing, such as morphological analysis and generation (Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992; Clemenceau 1993), parsing (Roche 1993; Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1993), phonology (Laporte 1993; Kaplan and Kay 1994) and speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994). Although finite-state machines have been used for part-of-speech tagging (Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1993; Silberztein 1993), none of these approaches has the same flexibility as stochastic techniques. Unlike stochastic approaches to part-of-speech tagging (Church 1988; Kupiec 1992; Cutting et al. 1992; Merialdo 1990; DeRose 1988; Weischedel et al. 1993), up to now the knowledge found in finite-state taggers has been handcrafted and wa</context>

The formalization of this notion and an algorithm for computing the composed transducer are well known and are described originally by Elgot and Mezei (1965). Returning to our running example of Section 2, the transducer obtained by composing the local extension of T2 (right in Figure 5) with the local extension of T1 (right in Figure 4) is shown in Figure 6. The fourth and final step consists of transforming the finite-state transducer obtained in the previous step into an equivalent subsequential (deterministic) transducer. The transducer obtained in the previous step may contain some nondeterminism. The fourth step tries to turn it into a deterministic machine.

Since the dictionary is the largest part of the tagger in terms of space, a compact representation is crucial. Moreover, the lookup process has to be very fast too otherwise the improvement in speed of the contextual manipulations would be of little practical interest. To achieve high speed for this procedure, the dictionary is represented by a deterministic finite-state automaton with both fast access and small storage space. Suppose one wants to encode the sample dictionary of Figure 9. The algorithm, as described by Revuz (1991), consists of first building a tree whose branches are labeled by letters and whose leaves are labeled by a list of tags (such as nn vb) , and then minimizing it into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The result of applying this procedure to the sample dictionary of Figure 9 is the DAG of Figure 10. When a dictionary is represented as a DAG, looking up a word in it consists simply of following one path in the DAG. The complexity of the lookup procedure depends only on the length of the word; in particular, it is independent of the size of the dictionary. The lexicon used in our system encodes 54</context>

This renewal of interest is due to the speed and compactness of finite-state representations. This efficiency is explained by two properties: finite-state devices can be made deterministic, and they can be turned into a minimal form. Such representations have been successfully applied to different aspects of natural language processing, such as morphological analysis and generation (Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992; Clemenceau 1993), parsing (Roche 1993; Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1993), phonology (Laporte 1993; Kaplan and Kay 1994) and speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).

With this notion, if a finite-state transducer is deterministic, one can apply the function to a given word by deterministically following a single path in the transducer. Deterministic transducers are called subsequential transducers (Schfitzenberger 1977).9 Given a deterministic transducer, we can define the partial functions q 0a = q&apos; iff d(q, a) -= {q&apos;} and q * a = w&apos; iff E Q such that q 0 a = q&apos; and 6 (q , a, q&apos;) = {w&apos;} . This leads to the definition of subsequential transducers: a subsequential transducer T&apos; is a seven-tuple (E, Q, i, F, 0, *, p) where: E, Q, i, F are defined as above; 0 is the deterministic state transition function that maps Q x E on Q, one writes q Oa = q&apos;; * is the deterministic emission function that maps Q x E on E*, one writes q * a = w&apos;; and the final emission function p maps F on E*, one writes p(q) = w.

The transducer is first represented by a two-dimensional table whose rows are indexed by states and whose columns are indexed by the alphabet of all possible input letters. The content of the table at line q and at column a is the word w such that the transition from q with the input label a outputs w. Since only a few transitions are allowed from many states, this table is very sparse and can be compressed. This compression is achieved while maintaining random access using a procedure for sparse data tables following the method given by Tarjan and Yao (1979). 12. Conclusion The techniques described in this paper are more general than the problem of part-ofspeech tagging and are applicable to the class of problems dealing with local transformation rules. We showed that any transformation-based program can be transformed into a deterministic finite-state transducer. This yields to optimal time implementations of transformation based programs. As a case study, we applied these techniques to the problem of part-of-speech tagging and presented a finite-state tagger that requires n steps to tag a sentence of length n, independently of the number of rul</context>
