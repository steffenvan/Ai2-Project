A central claim of centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995 henceforth GJW)
is that certain entities mentioned in an utterance are more central than others, and
that this property imposes constraints on a speaker&apos;s use of different types of ex-
pressions to refer to them. To articulate some of these constraints, they define several
fundamental centering concepts and propose rules based on them that should be fol-
lowed by a speaker in producing coherent discourse. This work has led to several
analyses employing centering theory and extensions of it, particularly in the area of
pronoun interpretation (Kameyama 1986; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Di Eu-
genio 1990, 1996; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996, inter alia; see
also citations within GJW, forthcoming papers in Walker, Joshi, and Prince in press,
and psycholinguistic studies described in Hudson-D&apos;Zmura 1989, Gordon, Grosz, and
Gilliom 1993, and Brennan 1995).1 In this squib, we discuss some facets of the pro-
noun interpretation problem that motivate a centering-style analysis, and demonstrate
some problems with a popular centering-based approach with respect to these moti-
vations.

2. Overview of Centering
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989965">
Centering theory is motivated by two related facts about language that are not ex-
plained by purely content-based models of reference and coherence (cf. Hobbs [19791):
(1) that the coherence of a discourse does not depend only on semantic content but
also on the type of referring expressions used, and (2) the existence of garden path ef-
fects, in which pronouns appear to be resolved before adequate semantic information
has become available:
Pronouns and definite descriptions are not equivalent with respect to
their effect on coherence. We conjecture that this is so because they

1 A draft of GJW, which revised and expanded ideas presented in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983),
was circulated as far back as 1986. Therefore some of the works described here as extending the work
contained therein are dated prior to the published version.

engender different inferences on the part of a hearer or reader. In
the most pronounced cases, the wrong choice will mislead a hearer
and force backtracking to a correct interpretation. (Grosz, Joshi, and
Weinstein 1995, p. 207)
GJW exemplify the first of these motivations with passages (1) and (2). Passage (1) is
presumed to be in a longer segment that is currently centered on John.

b. He called up Mike yesterday.
c. John wanted to meet him quite urgently.

<bodyText confidence="0.583324">
The third sentence in this passage is quite odd, presumably because the more central
element (John) is not referred to with a pronoun whereas the less central element
(Mike) is. This passage can be compared to the similar passage in (2).

Although the propositional content expressed by these two passages is the same (the
only difference being the expression used to refer to John in the subject of the third
sentence), passage (2) is not jarring in the way that (1) is.
GJW exemplify the second of these motivations with passage (3).

(3) a. Terry really goofs sometimes.
b. Yesterday was a beautiful day and he was excited about trying out his

Sentence (3e) causes the hearer to be misled: whereas common sense considerations
indicate that the intended referent for He is Tony, hearers tend to initially assign Terry
as its referent. Such examples suggest that more is involved in pronoun interpretation
than simply reasoning about semantic plausibility. In particular, they suggest that
hearers assign referents to pronouns before interpreting the remainder of the sentence.
Details of Centering. In GJW&apos;s centering theory, each utterance Ur, in a discourse has
exactly one backward-looking center (denoted Cb (U„)) and a partially ordered set of
forward-looking centers (denoted Cf(Un)). Roughly speaking, Cf (Un) contains all enti-
ties referred to in Lin; among these is Cb(Un). Following Brennan, Friedman, and Pol-
lard (1987), we refer to the highest-ranked forward-looking center as Cp(11).2 Cb(U5+1)
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.81672525">
2 The issues pertaining to how the ordering of entities in Cf(Lln) is determined have not been completely
resolved. For the examples discussed in this paper, we can use the hierarchy of grammatical relations
given by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), in which the grammatical subject is ranked above all
other grammatical relations (object, object2, and so forth).

Kehler Centering for Pronoun Interpretation
is by definition the most highly ranked element of Cf(U,i) realized in U„+1. Three in-
tersentential relationships between a pair of utterances Lin and U„±i are defined:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9699505">
1. Center Continuation: Cb(Un+1) = Cb(Un) = Cp(Un+i). In this case
Cb(Un+i) is the most likely candidate for Cb(Uti-4-2)•

case Cb(Un+i) is not the most likely candidate for Cb(Un+2)•
3. Center Shifting: Cb(Un+1) Cb(1-In)•
The following rules are proposed in GJW:
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.859536">
Rule 1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999537">
If any element of Cf(Un) is realized by a pronoun in utterance Un+i, then Cb(Un+i)
must be realized as a pronoun also.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.874971">
Rule 2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996193166666667">
Sequences of continuations are preferred over sequences of retaining; and sequences
of retaining are to be preferred over sequences of shifting.
The use of Rule 1 is illustrated by the oddness of passage (1) as compared to
passage (2), because in (1c) the Cb (John) is not pronominalized whereas a non-Cb
(Mike) is. The examples GJW give to illustrate Rule 2 are shown in passages (4) and
(5).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987439125">
(4) a. John went to his favorite music store to buy a piano.
b. He had frequented the store for many years.
c. He was excited that he could finally buy a piano.
d. He arrived just as the store was closing for the day.
(5) a. John went to his favorite music store to buy a piano.
b. It was a store John had frequented for many years.
c. He was excited that he could finally buy a piano.
d. It was closing just as John arrived.

Like passages (1) and (2), passages (4) and (5) express the same propositional con-
tent, yet they are not equally coherent. Whereas passage (4) consists of a sequence of
Continue relations centered on John, passage (5) is marked by movements between
Continuing and Retaining, which gives the effect that the passage flips back-and-forth
between being about John and being about his favorite music store.
Rule 1 is presented as a constraint on center realization, and Rule 2 as a con-
straint on center movement. As formulated, the predictions these rules make about
the preferred referents of pronouns are fairly limited.&apos; For instance, Rule 1 makes no

3 GJW do not make any specific proposals for using Rules 1 and 2 for pronoun interpretation. In
Section 3, we discuss a particular utilization of these rules for pronoun interpretation proposed by
Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987). An apparently popular misconception attributes this utilization
to GJW, however neither the draft nor final versions of GJW put forth such a proposal. See also GJW

Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987, henceforth BFP) describe an algorithm for pro-
noun interpretation based on centering principles, which is also utilized in Walker,
Iida, and Cote (1994, henceforth WIC). In addition to Rule 1, BFP utilize Rule 2 in
making predictions for pronominal reference. They augment the transition hierarchy
by replacing the Shift transition with two transitions, termed Smooth-Shift and Rough-
Shift, which are differentiated on the basis of whether or not Cb(Uti+j) is also Cp (Un+1) -5

correctly predicts that He and him in sentence (3d) refer to Terry and Tony respec-
tively, since this assignment results in a Continue relation whereas the Tony/Terry
assignment results in a less-preferred Retain relation. Their rules also account for the
oddness of sentence (3e), since assigning he to Tony results in a Smooth-Shift whereas
assigning he to Terry results in a Continue. Therefore, the algorithm makes the correct
predictions regarding example (3), one of the central motivating examples of centering
theory.
Problems with the BFP Algorithm. The fact that the BFP algorithm predicts the garden
path effect exhibited by sentence (3e) is particularly indicative that it embodies the
motivations for centering theory. As we noted in Section 2, such effects distinguish
centering-based approaches from purely content-based models of reference and coher-
ence (Hobbs 1979, inter alia). As Brennan (1995) explains:
While knowledge-based theories often succeed in resolving referring
expressions in this manner [=using semantic information and world
knowledge, without taking advantage of the kinds of syntactic con-
straints that centering uses], they do not model human discourse pro-
cessing. An entirely knowledge-based algorithm would not reproduce
an addressee&apos;s immediate tendency to interpret a pronoun as cospec-
ifying the backward center, even when this results in an implausible
interpretation. (Brennan 1995, p. 145)
However, other examples demonstrate that the BFP algorithm also cannot model an
addressee&apos;s immediate tendency to interpret a pronoun, and therefore cannot properly
account for the pronoun interpretation preferences that result from such tendencies.
To illustrate, we consider a modification to passage (3), shown in passage (6), with
three possible follow-ons (6ei-e3).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991125111111111">

d. Tony called him at 6AM the next morning. [Cb=Terry, Cp=Tony]

Sentence (6d) constitutes a Retain, in which Cp(U6d) is Tony and Cb(U6d) is Terry.
Retains often result in an ambiguity based on whether a subsequent subject pronoun
refers to Cb(Uii) (resulting in a Continue) or to Cp( ) (resulting in a Smooth-Shift).
While the subject pronouns in follow-ons (6e1-e3) may all display this ambiguity to a
certain degree, the preferences associated with them appear to be consistent among the
three variants.&apos; That is, the initial preference for the subject pronominal He in sentence

(6e1) does not appear to be affected by the subsequent inclusion of the phrases with
him in variant (6e2) and with Tony in variant (6e3). This accords with the observation
that hearers have an immediate tendency to resolve subject pronouns based on the
existing discourse state, before the entire sentence is interpreted.
Within the BFP algorithm, however, the ways in which these follow-ons are ana-
lyzed differ radically, as summarized in Table 2. In follow-on (6e1), assigning He=Terry
results in a Continue whereas assigning He=Tony results in a Smooth-Shift, and so
Terry is preferred. In follow-on (6e2), assigning He=Terry results in a Rough-Shift
whereas assigning He=Tony again results in a Smooth-Shift, and so Tony is preferred.
The reason for this difference is attributable solely to the fact that the pronoun him
occurs in (6e2): because there are two non-coreferring pronouns in (6e2), one must refer
to Tony, and because Tony is Cp(U6d), by definition Tony is Cb(U6e2) instead of Terry.
Finally, in sentence (6e3), the assignment of He=Terry results in a Rule 1 violation—the
Cb Tony is not pronominalized whereas Terry is—putting it in the company of highly
awkward examples such as passage (1). If we ignore this violation, the resulting tran-
sition is again a Rough-Shift, the lowest-ranked relation. (The assignment of He=Tony
is ruled out by a syntactic constraint violation.)
These varied results are inconsistent with the aforementioned facts concerning
these passages in both empirical and theoretical respects. Empirically, the results are
counter to the more consistent preferences associated with the subject pronouns in each
case. Theoretically, such consistency is just what one would expect given a hearer&apos;s
immediate tendency to resolve subject pronouns based on the existing discourse state.
In either regard, it is unclear why the inclusion of the phrases with him in variant (6e2)
and with Tony in variant (6e3) should lead to such varied predictions for the subject
pronoun. In fact, the example illustrates a general property of the BFP algorithm: that
the preferred assignment for a pronoun in such examples, even in subject position,
cannot be determined until the entire sentence has been processed. This property re-
sults from the fact that determining the transition type between a pair of utterances
Lin and //41 requires the identification of Cb(Up+i), and a noun phrase (pronominal
or not) can occur at any point in the utterance that will alter the assignment of Cb(Un+i )•
This is what occurs in the analysis of passage (6): whereas the Cb of sentence (6ei) is
these sentences in that any garden path in sentence (6e3) may be resolved earlier than in (6e1) and (6e2),
specifically, at the point at which Tony is reached. This is a result of the fact that syntactic constraints on
coreference can be used to eliminate the possibility of He referring to Tony at that time, whereas in the
other cases it is semantic information that comes later in the sentence that eliminates Tony as a referent.

Terry assuming He refers to Terry, the occurrence of him later in the sentence in (6e2)
and similarly Tony in (6e3) causes the Cb to be Tony, thus changing the bindings that
constitute the various transition possibilities, and in this case, the predicted preferred
referents. To be clear, this is not an issue regarding the efficiency nor the cognitive
reality of BFP&apos;s particular algorithm; in fact neither BFP nor WIC make any claims to
these effects. The problem lies more generally in their proposal to utilize Rule 2 along
with the definition of Cb(Un+i) to interpret pronouns—any algorithm incorporating
this proposal will have to process an entire sentence before determining the preferred
referents of pronouns; no reordering of processing within the BFP algorithm can alter
this fact. The need to process an entire sentence to recover pronoun assignments, how-
ever, is one that GJW and Brennan (1995) argue against in motivating centering over
purely content-based models of reference and coherence. That is, this very property
renders such an approach incapable of modeling the preferences associated with an
addressee&apos;s immediate tendency to interpret pronouns, as example (6) demonstrates.&apos;
Preferences and Other Intersentential Relationships. The motivations for centering cited
by GJW and Brennan (1995) reflect the intuition that salience plays a central role
in pronoun interpretation. What remains at issue is the manner in which salience is
utilized by the pronoun interpreter. In the previous section we argued that BFP&apos;s use
of Rule 2 along with the transition definitions and definition of Cb does not provide
the correct utilization. In fact, the only aspects of Un and Un+i utilized by the BFP
algorithm are the identities of Cb(Un), C(U), Cb(Un+1), and Cp ( Un±i ), as well as the
types of expressions used to refer to them. Here, we argue that this is also insufficient.
There is a well-known contrast between passages that are coherent by virtue of
being a narration, as is the case for sentence (7c) and follow-on (7d), versus those
coherent by virtue of parallelism, as is the case for sentence (7c) and follow-on (7d&apos;).

The preferred referent for the pronoun in example (7d) is Bob Dole, whereas the
preferred referent for the pronoun in example (7d&apos;) is Bill Clinton. However, each
passage shares sentences (7a-c), and therefore Cp(U7c) and Cb(1.17c) are the same for each
follow-on. Furthermore, each follow-on contains a new subject (Ross Perot, who will be
7 In order to model this tendency in the BFP algorithm, one might consider a strategy in which
provisional referents are assigned to pronouns while proceeding left-to-right in the current utterance.
Under such a strategy one could assume that Cb(Un+1) is computed incrementally using the
assumption that no additional elements will appear in 11,,±1 that are more highly ranked in Cf(14).
Then, garden paths would be predicted when this assumption does not hold and the assignment of
Cb(Un+i) must be changed, in addition to those caused by semantic influences such as in sentence (3e).
Again, however, this strategy would treat follow-ons (6e1) and (6e2) quite differently. This strategy
would predict no garden path effect for follow-on (6e1), since it assigns Terry as the referent of he and
sticks with it. On the other hand, (6e2) should be much worse because two garden paths would be
predicted: one for changing Cb(1.1,,±1) from Terry to Tony when the pronoun him is processed, and
another for the semantic information subsequently preferring Terry. This difference does not appear to
be reflected in the actual judgements for these two examples (in both cases we find a similar garden
path effect), although experimental evidence would be required to confirm these judgements.

because the relevant Cb and Cr relations are the same, a BFP-style approach cannot
distinguish between these cases.&apos; These examples show that pronominal reference
preferences are affected by additional types of intersentential relationships that may be
identifiable at the time a pronoun is encountered; proposals along these lines include
preference-ranking schemes (e.g., Kameyama [1996]) and systems in which salience
and the process of determining coherence relations interact (e.g., Kehler [1995]).

not model this tendency, which in turn limits the ability of their algorithm to account
for the data. Furthermore, data has been presented that shows that in addition to the
salience factors utilized by BFP, additional types of intersentential relationships must
be taken into account.

8 The BFP approach prefers Bob Dole as the referent for the pronoun in each case. Note that passage (7)
with follow-on (7d&apos;) contradicts BFP&apos;s (page 157) and WIC&apos;s (page 223) claim that constraints based on
structural parallelism, such as Kameyama&apos;s (1986) property-sharing constraint, are epiphenomena of
BFP&apos;s ordering of the Cf and preference for Continue interpretations, since such constraints predict that
Bill Clinton is the referent of him, not Bob Dole. Note also that an appeal to semantic plausibility
factors to alter the preferences for example (7d&apos;) will not work, since it is at least as plausible that Perot
would slam Dole on his tax policies as it is that he would slam Clinton.
Suri and McCoy (1994) also provide minimal pairs that are problematic for BFP, which their
algorithm correctly handles. However, their algorithm also cannot distinguish between the above pair,
preferring Bill Clinton as the referent in both cases.

This work has led to several analyses employing centering theory and extensions of it, particularly in the area of pronoun interpretation (Kameyama 1986; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Di Eugenio 1990, 1996; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996, inter alia; see also citations within GJW, forthcoming papers in Walker, Joshi, and Prince in press, and psycholinguistic studies described in Hudson-D&apos;Zmura 1989, Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993, and Brennan 1995).1 In this squib, we discuss some facets of the pronoun interpretation problem that motivate a centering-style analysis, and demonstrate some problems with a popular centering-based approach with respect to these motivations. 2. Overview of Centering Centering theory is motivated by two related facts about language that are not explained by purely content-based models of reference and coherence (cf. Hobbs [19791): (1) that the coherence of a discourse does not depend only on semantic content but also on the type of referring expressions used, and (2) the existence of garden path effects, in wh</context>

Therefore, the algorithm makes the correct predictions regarding example (3), one of the central motivating examples of centering theory. Problems with the BFP Algorithm. The fact that the BFP algorithm predicts the garden path effect exhibited by sentence (3e) is particularly indicative that it embodies the motivations for centering theory. As we noted in Section 2, such effects distinguish centering-based approaches from purely content-based models of reference and coherence (Hobbs 1979, inter alia). As Brennan (1995) explains: While knowledge-based theories often succeed in resolving referring expressions in this manner [=using semantic information and world knowledge, without taking advantage of the kinds of syntactic constraints that centering uses], they do not model human discourse processing. An entirely knowledge-based algorithm would not reproduce an addressee&apos;s immediate tendency to interpret a pronoun as cospecifying the backward center, even when this results in an implausible interpretation. (Brennan 1995, p. 145) However, other examples demonstrate that the BFP algorithm also cannot model an a</context>

The problem lies more generally in their proposal to utilize Rule 2 along with the definition of Cb(Un+i) to interpret pronouns—any algorithm incorporating this proposal will have to process an entire sentence before determining the preferred referents of pronouns; no reordering of processing within the BFP algorithm can alter this fact. The need to process an entire sentence to recover pronoun assignments, however, is one that GJW and Brennan (1995) argue against in motivating centering over purely content-based models of reference and coherence. That is, this very property renders such an approach incapable of modeling the preferences associated with an addressee&apos;s immediate tendency to interpret pronouns, as example (6) demonstrates.&apos; Preferences and Other Intersentential Relationships. The motivations for centering cited by GJW and Brennan (1995) reflect the intuition that salience plays a central role in pronoun interpretation. What remains at issue is the manner in which salience is utilized by the pronoun interpreter. In the previo</context>
