<bodyText confidence="0.999354583333334">
Bill Mann, Program Committee Chair, reported on
special features of the program. The Committee was
divided into two Panels, one devoted to theory, the other
to applications. A deliberate attempt was made to
encourage more submissions in the latter category, but
they were not forthcoming. Forty of the 61 papers
submitted were accepted. A tutorial program was intro-
duced for the first time at a regular ACL meeting (one
had been held at the Conference on Applied Natural
Language Processing in 1983, and COLING84 had a
&amp;quot;mini-summer school&amp;quot; during the week preceding that
conference). The exhibits program was larger and more
extensive than the one at COLING84, with a number of
demonstrations from university and industry groups.
[NOTE: The final attendance figures show that 363
people registered for the meeting. The 332 page
proceedings is available from the ACL office at $15 for
members, $20 for nonmembers. The tutorials also
proved to be quite successful: 83 attended the Parser
tutorial by Jonathan Slocum; 62 were at Prolog by
Fernando Pereira; 16 at Speech by Beatrice Oshika and
Jared Bernstein; 58 at Interfaces by Norman Sondheimer
and Madeleine Bates; and 112 at Unification by Stuart
Shieber.]

Secretary-Treasurer&apos;s Report

<bodyText confidence="0.999973058823529">
Don Walker reported that income for the year 1984
exceeded expenditures by almost $50,000 ($178,579
against $129,080), resulting in accumulated assets of
$153,927 for the period. Some progress has been made
toward setting up cost centers, but it is still not possible
to allocate expenses accurately. With that qualification,
proceedings sales and conference income help offset loss-
es to the membership account. However, the largest
source of income is the distribution of surplus from the
National Computer Conference by AFIPS, an amount
almost equal to the ACL surplus. Preliminary figures for
the first half of 1985 show an even greater surplus, but
relatively few expenses have been incurred yet for the
year. The total number of personal members at the end
of the year was 1355, down slightly from 1983. Institu-
tional membership was up slightly, to 325. A new
membership drive under the direction of Alan Biermann

James Allen reported that the first three issues of the
journal, representing a set of papers on machine trans-
lation, were almost ready for the printers. The final issue
could be ready before the end of the year. Almost half
of the 35 papers submitted between June 1984 and June
1985 were accepted, which is more than the usual one-
third rate. He encouraged the organization of special
issues focused on particular topics. He also noted that
The FINITE STRING was beginning to publish site

submit information for those purposes.

Norm Sondheimer, the ACL Representative on the AFIPS
Board, noted that although the ACL was the smallest
AFIPS constituent society, it was one of the oldest.
Reporting on recent developments, he stated that Egils
Milberg, a former Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce,
had been appointed Executive Director. Active programs
in government activities, education, and publications are
in progress.
Martha Evens, who represents the ACL on both the
Awards and the NCC Program Planning Committee,
reminded the audience that two ACL sessions were sche-
duled at the National Computer Conference, which was
to be held in Chicago the following week. She had
organized a session on &amp;quot;Microcomputer Databases that
Understand English&amp;quot;; Kathleen McKeown had arranged
one on &amp;quot;Computer-Text Generation — Communicating in
English&amp;quot;. [NOTE: The people and papers presented are

Mary Dee Harris, newly appointed to chair the Associ-
ation for Computers and the Humanities, pointed out the
overlapping interests of the ACH and the ACL, suggest-
ing that there should be more effective coordination. She
also recommended that the ACL consider holding a meet-
ing in conjunction with the Association for Literary and
Linguistic Computing.
Efforts are under way to increase cooperation with the
Linguistic Society of America, as the scheduling of meet-
ings for 1986 and 1987 referred to above demonstrates.
The ACL is considering co-sponsoring the 1987 Linguis-
tic Institute.
Recognizing the imminence of the ACL 25th Anniver-
sary in 1987, plans are being made to reflect on its histo-
ry.
Robin Cohen announced that she plans to conduct a
survey of course contents in computational linguistics. It
will be reported in a future issue of the journal.
Klaus Obermeier reported the establishment of a
Clearinghouse on Natural Language Processing Systems
and Intelligent User Interfaces at Battelle Columbus
Laboratories. He offered to send a questionnaire to

might be used to encourage computational studies of
languages that would otherwise not be supported by

<bodyText confidence="0.999319444444445">
The International Fund was set up to make ACL
memberships and publications available to colleagues
who have difficulty in using their national currencies for
international transactions. Recently, we have broadened
it to allow us to reach people whose current financial
situation makes it impossible for them to join the Associ-
ation. One recent member in this category, a student in
India, provides an appropriate model to justify this form
of participation. He states that when he is further along
in his graduate studies, he will reimburse the Interna-
tional Fund for its support. While there should be no
requirement to do that, it is a way of ensuring that access
to these sources of information are made widely avail-
able. If anyone knows of others in similar situations in
any part of the world, please provide the ACL office with
names and addresses. And do not hesitate to make
contributions directly to the International Fund to enable
us to extend this program.
