In this paper, we describe TANGO as a
collocational concordancer for looking up
collocations. The system was designed to
answer user’s query of bilingual collocational
usage for nouns, verbs and adjectives. We first
obtained collocations from the large
monolingual British National Corpus (BNC).
Subsequently, we identified collocation
instances and translation counterparts in the
bilingual corpus such as Sinorama Parallel
Corpus (SPC) by exploiting the word-
alignment technique. The main goal of the
concordancer is to provide the user with a
reference tools for correct collocation use so
as to assist second language learners to acquire
the most eminent characteristic of native-like
writing.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881128205128">
Collocations are a phenomenon of word
combination occurring together relatively often.
Collocations also reflect the speaker’s fluency of a
language, and serve as a hallmark of near native-
like language capability.
Collocation extraction is critical to a range of
studies and applications, including natural
language generation, computer assisted language
learning, machine translation, lexicography, word
sense disambiguation, cross language information
retrieval, and so on.
Hanks and Church (1990) proposed using point-
wise mutual information to identify collocations in
lexicography; however, the method may result in
unacceptable collocations for low-count pairs. The
best methods for extracting collocations usually
take into consideration both linguistic and
statistical constraints. Smadja (1993) also detailed
techniques for collocation extraction and
developed a program called XTRACT, which is
capable of computing flexible collocations based
on elaborated statistical calculation. Moreover, log
likelihood ratios are regarded as a more effective
method to identify collocations especially when the
occurrence count is very low (Dunning, 1993).
Smadja’s XTRACT is the pioneering work on
extracting collocation types. XTRACT employed
three different statistical measures related to how
associated a pair to be collocation type. It is
complicated to set different thresholds for each
statistical measure. We decided to research and
develop a new and simple method to extract
monolingual collocations.
We also provide a web-based user interface
capable of searching those collocations and its
usage. The concordancer supports language
learners to acquire the usage of collocation. In the
following section, we give a brief overview of the
TANGO concordancer.

TANGO is a concordancer capable of answering
users’ queries on collocation use. Currently,
TANGO supports two text collections: a
monolingual corpus (BNC) and a bilingual corpus
(SPC). The system consists of four main parts:

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959066666667">
For CoNLL-2000 shared task, chunking is
considered as a process that divides a sentence into
syntactically correlated parts of words. With the
benefits of CoNLL training data, we built a
chunker that turn sentences into smaller syntactic
structure of non-recursive basic phrases to
facilitate precise collocation extraction. It becomes
easier to identify the argument-predicate
relationship by looking at adjacent chunks. By
doing so, we save time as opposed to n-gram
statistics or full parsing. Take a text in CoNLL-
2000 for example:
The words correlated with the same chunk tag
can be further grouped together (see Table 1). For
instance, with chunk information, we can extract

different chunk tags: B-CHUNK for the first word

the same chunk)
the target VN collocation “take dive” from the
example by considering the last word of two
adjacent VP and NP chunks. We build a robust and
efficient chunking model from training data of the
CoNLL shared task, with up to 93.7% precision
and recall.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997565625">
In some cases, only considering the chunk
information is not enough. For example, the
sentence “...the attitude he had towards the
country is positive...” may cause problem. With
the chunk information, the system extracts out the
type “have towards the country” as a VPN
collocation, yet that obviously cuts across two
clauses and is not a valid collocation. To avoid that
kind of errors, we further take the clause
information into account.
With the training and test data from CoNLL-
2001, we built an efficient HMM model to identify
clause relation between words. The language
model provides sufficient information to avoid
extracting wrong collocations. Examples show as
follows (additional clause tags will be attached):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99107525">
(1) ....the attitude (S* he has *S) toward the country
(2) (S* I think (S* that the people are most
concerned with the question of (S* when
conditions may become ripe. *S)S)S)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999692166666667">
As a result, we can avoid combining a verb with
an irrelevant noun as its collocate as “have toward
country” in (1) or “think ... people” in (2). When
the sentences in the corpus are annotated with the
chunk and clause information, we can
consequently extract collocations more precisely.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998911">
2.2 Collocation Type Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971727272727">
A large set of collocation candidates can be
obtained from BNC, via the process of integrating
chunk and clause information. We here consider
three prevalent Verb-Noun collocation structures
in corpus: VP+NP, VP+PP+NP, and VP+NP+PP.
Exploiting Logarithmic Likelihood Ratio (LLR)
statistics, we can calculate the strength of
association between two collocates. The
collocational type with threshold higher than 7.88
(confidence level 99.5%) will be kept as one entry
in our collocation type list.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996806">
2.3 Collocation Instance Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996209566666667">
We subsequently identify collocation instances
in the bilingual corpus (SPC) with the collocation
types extracted from BNC in the previous step.
Making use of the sequence of chunk types, we
again single out the adjacent structures of VN,
VPN, and VNP. With the help of chunk and clause
information, we thus find the valid instances where
the expected collocation types are located, so as to
build a collocational concordance. Moreover, the
quantity and quality of BNC also facilitate the
collocation identification in another smaller
bilingual corpus with better statistic measure.

2.4 Extracting Collocational Translation
Equivalents in Bilingual Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991166666667">
When accurate instances are obtained from
bilingual corpus, we continue to integrate the
statistical word-alignment techniques (Melamed,
1997) and dictionaries to find the translation
candidates for each of the two collocates. We first
locate the translation of the noun. Subsequently,
we locate the verb nearest to the noun translation
to find the translation for the verb. We can think of
collocation with corresponding translations as a
kind of translation memory (shows in Table 2).The
implementation result of BNC and SPC shows in
the Table 3, 4, and 5.

3 Collocation Concordance
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99736675">
With the collocation types and instances
extracted from the corpus, we built an online
collocational concordancer called TANGO for
looking up translation memory. A user can type in
any English query and select the intended part of
speech of query and collocate. For example in
Figure 1, after query for the verb collocates of the
noun “influence” is submitted, the results are
displayed on the return page. The user can then
browse through different collocates types and also
click to get to see all the instances of a certain
collocation type.

Moreover, using the technique of bilingual
collocation alignment and sentence alignment, the
system will display the target collocation with
highlight to show translation equivalents in con-
text. Translators or learners, through this web-
based interface, can easily acquire the usage of
each collocation with relevant instances. This
collocational concordancer is a very useful tool for
self-inductive learning tailored to intermedi-ate or
advanced English learners.
Users can obtain the result of the VN or AN
collocations related to their query. TANGO shows
the collocation types and instances with
collocations and translation counterparts high-
lighted.

average precision of 89.3 % with regard to

In this paper, we describe an algorithm that
employs linguistic and statistical analyses to
extract instance of VN collocations from a very
large corpus; we also identify the corresponding
translations in a parallel corpus. The algorithm is
applicable to other types of collocations without
being limited by collocation’s span. The main
difference between our algorithm and previous
work lies in that we extract valid instances instead
of types, based on linguistic information of chunks
and clauses. Moreover, in our research we observe

way for more comprehensive applications.
