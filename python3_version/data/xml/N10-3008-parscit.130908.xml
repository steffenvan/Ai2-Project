Temporal relation classification task has is-
sues of fourteen target relations, skewed dis-
tribution of the target relations, and relatively
small amount of data. To overcome the is-
sues, methods such as merging target relations
and increasing data size with closure algo-
rithm have been used. However, the method
using merged relations has a problem on how
to recover original relations. In this paper,
a new reduced-relation method is proposed.
The method decomposes a target relation into
four pairs of endpoints with three target rela-
tions. After classifying a relation of each end-
point pair, four classified relations are com-
bined into a relation of original fourteen target
relations. In the combining step, two heuris-
tics are examined.

An interesting task in temporal information process-
ing is how to identify a temporal relation between
a pair of temporal entities such as events (EVENT)
and time expressions (TIMEX) in a narrative. Af-
ter the publication of TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al.,
2003b) annotated in TimeML (Pustejovsky et al.,
2003a), supervised learning techniques have been
tested in the temporal relation identification task
with different types of temporal entity pairs (Cham-
bers et al., 2007; Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Verha-
gen et al., 2007).
There are three issues in applying supervised ma-
chine learning methods to this task. The first issue
is that a temporal entity pair that is defined as a di-
rected temporal link (TLINK) in TimeML should be
40
classified into a relation among fourteen relations.
The second issue is that the number of TLINKs is
relatively small in spite of the fourteen targets. The
third issue is skewed distributions of the relations.
Without the solutions of the issues, it is impossi-
ble to achieve good performance in temporal relation
identification through machine learning techniques.
Several solutions have been suggested such as in-
creased number of TLINKs with a transitivity clo-
sure algorithm (Mani et al., 2007; Chambers et
al., 2007) and decreased target relations into six
(Mani et al., 2006; Chambers et al., 2007; Tatu and
Srikanth, 2008) or three (Verhagen et al., 2007). An
issue of the reduced-relation method is how to re-
cover original relations. A module for the recovery
can cause performance degeneration and seems in-
tuitively inappropriate.
In this paper, a new reduced-relation method is
presented. The method uses endpoints of tempo-
ral entities. A TimeML relation can be represented
into four endpoint pairs with three relations: before,
equal, and after. This method requires four rela-
tion identification classifiers among endpoints for a
TLINK and each classifier has only three target re-
lations instead of fourteen. The four classified re-
lations need to be combined in order to restore an
interval-based relation. In this study, the perfor-
mance of the proposed method will be evaluated in
identifying TLINK relations between temporal enti-
ties empirically.
Firstly, related studies are described in section 2.
Secondly, the identification of four pointwise rela-
tions is described. Thirdly, methods for the combi-
nation of pointwise relations are explained. Finally,

10-fold cross validation is applied at document-
level. In some previous studies, all temporal links
were collected into a set and the set was split into
training and test data without the distinction on
sources. However, the approach could boost system
performance as shown in Tatu and Srikanth (2008).
When TLINKs in a file are split in training and
test data, links in training data can be composed of
similar words in test data. In that case, the links in
training can play a role of background knowledge.
Therefore, document-level 10-fold cross validation
is exploited.

4.1 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965007425531915">
In constructing feature vectors of three TLINK
types, features that were used in order to identify
TimeML relations in previous studies are adopted.
The features have been proved useful in identifying
a TimeML relation in the studies. Moreover, the fea-
tures still seem helpful for endpoint relation identifi-
cation task. For example, past and present tenses of
two EVENTs could be a clue to make a prediction
that present tensed EVENT is probably after past
tensed EVENT.
Annotated information of EVENT and TIMEX in
the temporal corpora is used in the feature vector
construction. This proposed approach to use end-
point conversion in relation identification task is the
first attempt. Therefore, the annotated values are
used as features in order to see the effect of this ap-
proach. However, state-of-the-arts natural language
processing programs such as Charniak parser and
Porter Stemmer are sometimes used to extract ad-
ditional features such as stems of event words, the
existence of both entities in the same phrase, and
etc.

Features for TIMEX In the extraction of TIMEX
features, it tries to capture if specific words are in a
time expression to normalize temporal expressions.
The time point of an expression can be inferred
through the specific words such as ago, coming, cur-
rent, earlier and etc. Additionally, the existence of
plural words such as seconds, minutes, hours, days,
months, and years is added as a feature. The specific
words are:
• ago, coming, current, currently, earlier, early,
every, following, future, last, later, latest, next,
now, once, past, previously, recent, recently,
soon, that, the, then, these, this, today, tomor-

Relational features between entities In addition,
relational information between two entities is used
as features. It is represented if two entities are in the
same sentence. To get the other relational informa-
tion, a sentence is parsed with Charniak parser. Syn-
tactic path from an anchor to a target is calculated
from the parsed tree. A syntactic path from reported
to the past three years is “VBNkVPkPPkNP”. It is
represented if two entities are in the same phrase
and clause with the path. When only one clause
or phrase exists in the path except part-of-speeches
of both entities, the features are marked as 1s. The
counts of words, phrases, and clauses between tem-
poral entities are also used as features. When two
entities are not in the same sentence, 0s are given
as the values of the features except the word count.
Some prepositions and conjunctions are used as fea-
tures when the words are used as a head word of
syntactic path from an entity to the other entity. In
the example of “VBNkVPkPPkNP”, “in” in “in the
past three years” is the head word of PP. So, in is
marked 1. The head words that are used as features

In the combining step, two heuristics are examined. 1 Introduction An interesting task in temporal information processing is how to identify a temporal relation between a pair of temporal entities such as events (EVENT) and time expressions (TIMEX) in a narrative. After the publication of TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b) annotated in TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a), supervised learning techniques have been tested in the temporal relation identification task with different types of temporal entity pairs (Chambers et al., 2007; Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Verhagen et al., 2007). There are three issues in applying supervised machine learning methods to this task. The first issue is that a temporal entity pair that is defined as a directed temporal link (TLINK) in TimeML should be 40 classified into a relation among fourteen relations. The second issue is that the number of TLINKs is relatively small in spite of the fourteen targets. The third issue is skewed distributions of the relations. Without the solutions of the issues, it is impossible to achieve good performance in temporal relation identification through machine learning techniques. S</context>

In some previous studies, all temporal links were collected into a set and the set was split into training and test data without the distinction on sources. However, the approach could boost system performance as shown in Tatu and Srikanth (2008). When TLINKs in a file are split in training and test data, links in training data can be composed of similar words in test data. In that case, the links in training can play a role of background knowledge. Therefore, document-level 10-fold cross validation is exploited. 4.1 Features In constructing feature vectors of three TLINK types, features that were used in order to identify TimeML relations in previous studies are adopted. The features have been proved useful in identifying a TimeML relation in the studies. Moreover, the features still seem helpful for endpoint relation identification </context>
