be used in educational applications. Bakker, van der
Korst, and van Schaaik put a new twist on using a
generator to implement and test a linguistic theory: they
propose using such a program to teach a particular
theory (in this case lexical functional grammar) in a
computational linguistics course.
An odd fact about the book is that it is published in
two volumes, each relatively short (under 200 pages).
The topics are split between the volumes, with half the
papers from each category in each book. I could find no
particular motivation for finding a paper in one volume
or the other. The foreword, introduction, and contents
are repeated in both books, and each has an index,
which unfortunately is split between the volumes, so
you need to look up topics twice to find all the papers
that address them. Overall, the division into volumes is
more annoying than useful (I inevitably found myself on
the right page of the wrong volume when looking for a
particular paper), and since there is no organization to
the division, it is unlikely that someone would be
interested in one volume and not the other.
Despite these complaints with the presentation and
some of the papers, the book is useful for researchers in
NLG and related fields to see the range of work going
on in Europe. While the papers themselves are short,
their bibliographies can lead the interested reader to a
wealth of related material. Furthermore, workshops
such as the one motivating this book are important and
their results need to be published. In a young field such
as NLG the focus of the workshops needs to be broad
so that it can define what the major issues are. Collec-
tions such as this one and Kempen (1987) help other
researchers see how their work interacts with the field
as a whole. As the field matures, however, these
workshops need to become more focused. As in the
AAAI-88 workshop (Hovy, McDonald, and Young
1988), the organizers and the editors need to formulate
questions and encourage researchers to address them
directly. This will provide more unity in the resulting
collections, allowing a reader to get a complete picture
of issues rather than isolated snapshots of individuals&apos;
work.

This volume, containing nine systematic studies on
several of the most advanced parsers, fulfills very well
the editor&apos;s aim characterized in his short preface,
namely to present detailed accounts of research by
outstanding specialists. The need for a complex over-
view of the present state of research in the field is
mentioned here as a point for subsequent work.
J.G. Carbonell and P.J. Hayes point out in their
contribution (pp. 1-32) how a multi-strategy approach
(dynamically changing the procedures according to
kinds of constructions being parsed) together with fail-
soft heuristics and with user interaction can be used for
an efficient treatment of semantic and structural ambi-
guity. Two implemented experimental parsers integrat-
ing several parsing strategies are characterized: CAS-
PAR, combining a case-oriented strategy (based on
domain semantics) with linear pattern matching, and
thus obtaining the flexibility and robustness needed to
handle several kinds of deviations from grammaticality;
and DYPAR, including a context-free grammar (with
domain information grouped into hierarchical semantic
categories), a pattern matching component, and a map-
ping into a canonical form (accounting for semantic
equivalence). Furthermore, an integration of the strat-
egies involved is discussed, yielding a multi-strategy
algorithm that uses top-down case-frame expectations
to constrain bottom-up pattern matching. ATNs with
logical variables and unification are compared with
definite clause grammars and used as the basic ingredi-
ents of the system described by T.W. Finin and M.
Stone Palmer (pp. 33-48). A similarity between the
applied framework and certain aspects of lexical func-
tional grammar are pointed out.
The third contribution, by J.G. Neal and S.C. Sha-
piro (pp. 49-92), stresses the role of natural language
understanding, pointing out that natural language serves
as its own metalanguage. A system understanding sen-
tences about the use of language is described, which
includes a kernel language (expressing the knowledge
necessary for a poor language user to be able to be

further instructed) and a set of inferences making it
possible to construct a knowledge base. No clear
boundary between syntax, semantics, and world knowl-
edge is preferred, and the semantic network consists of
nodes representing intensional concepts and arcs corre-
sponding to non-conceptual binary relations between
them. Many examples illustrate how a parser (with
applicable rules activated in parallel and with bi-direc-
tional inference) can be used to enrich the knowledge
system.
In the next study (pp. 93-135), J. Pitrat brings argu-
ments in favor of declarative knowledge. The inter-
preter presented here (parsing chess comments in
French) is general enough for the knowledge formalism
to take an arbitrary form, although (as the author states)
it does not yet use its knowledge as a metaknowledge
and is not more powerful than ATNs, especially in
dealing with word order.
M. Thiel&apos;s contribution (pp. 137-159) is devoted to
issues of probabilistic parsing with weights introduced
into the lexicon as well as into the set of grammar rules
and the control structures. Weights of words and rules
are modified in accordance to text type and subject
domain.
The word is the central notion of the approach
described by S.L. Small (pp. 161-201), who takes all
complex expressions of natural language as basically
idiomatic and attempts to substitute all syntactic and
semantic rules with word experts, which interact to-
gether and with higher-order (pragmatically based) pro-
cesses. One may ask whether the procedural definition
language is suitable for a specification of a word expert
of such a general character. In any case, the lexically
based treatment of syntax and semantics certainly is of
great significance.
A. Sagvall Heb presents the Uppsala Chart Proces-
sor, using R. Kaplan&apos;s approach and points out how
efficient the parsing by such a system may be (pp.
203-266). The main advantages of the processor are
summarized as consisting, first of all, in a clean cut
between the processor and the language, a clean control
structure provided by the active chart, the uniformity in
processing, the generality and flexibility of the formal-
ism, and the implementation with good tracing facilities.
A breadth-first parser is described by W.A. Martin,
K.W. Church, and R. S. Patil (pp. 267-328), who use an
adapted version of J. Earley&apos;s context-free algorithm,
with a procedural grammar, several procedures sup-
porting modularity, and G. Gazdar&apos;s treatment of un-
bounded dependencies. Some difficult grammatical phe-
nomena are treated as &amp;quot;exceptions&amp;quot;, without an
adequate degree of generality.
The volume is concluded by W. Dilger&apos;s discussion
of the syntax-directed translation in the system PLIDIS
(Karlsruhe), which uses a tree-directed grammar (pp.
329-361). On the basis of formal definitions and proofs
it is shown here that the grammars of this kind have less
computational capacity than transformational gram-
mars; the latter are understood as unsuitable for trans-
lating the input sentences into semantic representations,
since the complex transformational manipulation of
trees makes the grammar not only too strong, but also
too difficult to control.
This book consists of well-chosen contributions,
representing some of the main developments in parsing,
a field whose importance keeps growing thanks to the
growing relative weight of natural language comprehen-
sion within Al and to the broadening interest in machine
translation. Among the developments not represented
in Bole&apos;s volume, perhaps the most interesting is that
working with dependency grammar (as for English,
recent results of a long-term project can be found in
Kirschner 1987; for a framework attempting at an
integration of unification and dependency, see Hellwig
1988); this approach seems to be more advantageous
than the constituency-based trends especially in what
concerns the treatment of free word order (which has
already been recognized as being far from marginal and
playing an important role in the topic—focus articulation,
relevant for the issues of quantifier scopes; see Sgall et
al. 1986).
It is to the merit of the book that English is by far not
the only language handled. Such aspects as the attention
paid to the ease of control and enrichment of parsers, to
their flexibility with respect to various subject areas,
and to the integration of accounting for syntactic and
semantico-pragmatic phenomena make the volume a
valuable contribution to the development of computa-
tional linguistics. Even though progress in the domain
has brought new achievements during its production,
the volume remains worth reading, since many basic
ideas and significant insights are contained, and several
original approaches illustrated there are by far not
obsolete.

Sometimes philosophers and linguists say things that
are of interest to computer scientists or would be of
interest if properly explained. Unfortunately, philo-
sophical work and theoretical linguistics are seldom
explained in ways that make them seem relevant to
computer scientists. That is, they are seldom explained
in ways that suggest directions for future research.
Given this communication problem, there is a definite
need for a volume that can bring together some of the
best work in the philosophy of language, linguistics, and
natural language processing, and show how work in the
philosophy of language and linguistics has been and can
be applied to problems in natural language processing.
Unfortunately, despite the title&apos; and the promotional
literature, this volume does not fulfil the need. Part of
the problem is that none of the papers in the volume
describe work in which the theoretical insights of phi-
losophers and linguists are implemented. There are
simply no papers on natural language processing. There
is an introduction by Kulas that is supposed to show
why these essays are important to Al researchers. But
while the introduction occasionally provides reasonable
summaries of the essays, it doesn&apos;t come close to
suggesting applications of the theoretical work to Al. It
may well be that computer scientists ought to be famil-
iar with the essays in the book. Most of the essays are,
after all, classics. But it is pedagogically naive to think
that one can drop, for example, Davidson&apos;s &amp;quot;Truth and
Meaning&amp;quot; in the lap of a computer scientist and suppose
that it suggests anything in the way of a research
program.
Another part of the problem is that the volume has
been limited to papers that originally appeared in books
or journals published by D. Reidel. This is unfortunate,
for a number of sections of the book could have been
greatly strengthened with the addition of material pub-
lished elsewhere. Now it may be that the editors in-
tended to provide something like &amp;quot;D. Reidel&apos;s Greatest
Hits&amp;quot;, but such a strategy seems to me misguided.
There is nothing intrinsically interesting about the fact
that a paper was first published in a Reidel journal. It
may be that the move was inspired by the desire to hold
down costs,2 but if the editors were successful in
holding down costs, the savings certainly were not
passed along to the customer. The price of the 12-essay
volume is $99!
Thus far my comments have been strong, but gen-
eral. I think a section-by-section discussion of the book
may be in order, to point out specific concerns and to
suggest ways in which the collection might have been
improved.
The book begins with a prologue entitled &amp;quot;Modes of
Meaning&amp;quot;, which contains Grice&apos;s &amp;quot;Utterer&apos;s Meaning,
Sentence Meaning, and Word Meaning&amp;quot;—a great pa-
per, but what it is supposed to suggest to the Al
researcher is unclear. Nor is Kulas&apos;s introduction much
help here, as he offers only a one-sentence summary of
the paper.
Part 1 of the book is entitled &amp;quot;Formal Syntax of
Natural Language&amp;quot;, but is really about the question of
whether natural languages are context-free. The first
essay has no place in this volume. It is a short piece that
Pullum wrote as a &amp;quot;Topic . . . comment&amp;quot; column for
Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, which at-
tempts to sort out who was the first to show that natural
language is not context-free. The piece is not, nor do I
believe it intended to be, a serious piece of academic
research. (Pullum has even expressed amusement that
&amp;quot;Topic. . . comment&amp;quot; columns have been indexed and
abstracted.)3 This is not a criticism of Pullum; he has
other work on the problem of the context-freeness of
natural language (e.g., Pullum 1983) that would have
made much better additions to the volume. For that
matter, Gazdar and Pullum (1985) would also have been
a better choice. The second piece in Part 1 is Shieber&apos;s
&amp;quot;Evidence Against the Context Freeness of Natural
Language&amp;quot;, which is a solid piece showing how Swiss-
German is weakly non–context-free. But Shieber would
be the first to admit that the implications of the result for
natural language processing are of no great moment.
Part 2 of the collection is entitled &amp;quot;Semantic Aspects
of Natural Language&amp;quot; and contains Davidson&apos;s &amp;quot;Truth
and Meaning&amp;quot; and Hintikka&apos;s &amp;quot;Semantics for Proposi-
tional Attitudes&amp;quot;. I&apos;ve already noted that the import of
Davidson&apos;s paper (which makes no concessions to the
non-philosopher) is never made clear. As for Hintikka&apos;s
paper, it isn&apos;t really about semantics, but is an applica-
tion of possible-world semantics to the problem of the
attitudes. It more properly belongs with the Perry and
Stalnalcer papers in Part 5. What is unfortunate about
this part of the collection is that there really has been
confusion between philosophers and computer scien-
tists about what semantics is—a confusion that could
have been straightened out here. Most computer scien-
