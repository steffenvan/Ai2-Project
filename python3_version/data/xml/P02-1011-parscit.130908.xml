course Entities (DE&apos;s). Each DE represents
a particular concept&apos;s participation in the dis-
course. Most previous anaphora resolution al-
gorithms only create DE&apos;s for the referents of
NPs; but it is well known that this provides in-
sufficient support for all anaphoric pronouns, for
example (inspired by (Webber, 1988)):
(AO) Each Fall, penguins migrate to Fiji.
(Ala) That&apos;s where they wait out the winter.
(Alb) That&apos;s when it&apos;s too cold even for them.
(Ale) That&apos;s why I&apos;m going there next month.
(Aid) It happens just before the eggs hatch.
The pronouns in Ala and Alb depend only
on noun phrases in AO (Fiji and Fall), but Alc
refers to all of AO characterized as a fact, and the
pronoun in Ald refers to the migration event.
This example demonstrates that the same dis-
course unit (A0) can be characterized in a va-
riety of ways by the anaphoric reference (a fact
and an event in this case). These referents built
from constituents other than noun phrases are
called abstract referents.
Webber (1990) suggests that each discourse
unit produce a pseudo-DE that &amp;quot;stands proxy
for its propositional content&amp;quot;. Proxies can
be coerced into different types of referents by
applying referring functions (Nunberg, 1979).
Each referring function recharacterizes the dis-
course unit in a particular way. To interpret
the pronouns in example A, two functions are
needed: one that takes the proxy for AO and
creates a fact referent, and one for the event.1
Asher (1993) details the syntactic and semantic
conditions in which abstract referents are avail-
able for anaphoric reference.
In dialog, Walker and Whittaker (1990) point
out that once a question is asked, it remains
salient until answered. As a result, in problem-
solving conversations, particular aspects of the
solution that are important for determining how
well the proposed solution addresses the overall
goal are salient even if they were not explicitly
mentioned. These referents must be available
&apos;Webber (1990) additionally describes a model of dis-
course structure that explains which discourse units are
in focus at any point in the discourse, but PHORA does
not employ a sophisticated model of discourse structure
so those details are outside the scope of this discussion.
for interpreting anaphoric pronouns. Which as-
pects of the problem state are salient after each
action depends on the task underway. These
salient aspects of the solution can be inferred
using referring functions in a process similar to
evoking abstract referents. For example, in the
TRAINS93 domain, when the discourse partici-
pants must determine how much time the plan
will take, the following exchange is typical:
(BO) Send engine 1 to Elmira.
(Bla) That&apos;s six hours. / That&apos;ll be six p.m.
DE&apos;s evoked by NP&apos;s remain in the DM for the
duration of a discourse to support long-distance
anaphora. Abstract entities are only available
for pronominal reference in the immediately fol-
lowing discourse unit (Passonneau, 1991).

2.2 Pronoun Resolution Techniques
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999715518518519">
Most extant algorithms operate by linking an
anaphoric pronoun with the noun phrase that
is judged to be its antecedent. The search is
ordered either using syntactic structure (Hobbs,
1986) or an estimation of discourse salience (e.g.
(Brennan et al., 1987; Baldwin, 1997; Tetreault,
2001). Although different techniques use differ-
ent evidence for judging salience (grammatical
role, information structure, coherence structure,
etc.), it is generally agreed that items that ap-
pear as NP&apos;s in the sentence are most salient.2
Other items, such as the situation described by
the sentence, are less salient. Therefore, pro-
nouns that refer to these less salient items are
simply not addressed in the salience paradigm
because they cannot be resolved correctly.
The salience paradigm was originally moti-
vated by the fact that some pronouns have more
than one candidate referent with equally valid
semantic properties, yet human readers do not
find the sentence ambiguous. In example C from
Sidner (1983, pg. 373), the pronoun in sentence
Cl can refer to either the dog or the bull, but
the dog is chosen because it is more focused.
Sidner explains that the focused entity is chosen
as the referent for a pronoun unless its semantic
properties are incompatible with the predicative

vey and evaluation of several salience-based algorithms.

context of the pronoun. When multiple entities
with equal semantics are available as candidate
antecedents, salience provides a useful heuristic
for choosing between them.
(CO) Pam walked her dog near a bull one day.
(Cl) He trotted quietly along.
Relying on salience to guide pronoun inter-
pretation does not work for demonstrative pro-
nouns, which differ from personal pronouns
along several interrelated dimensions. First,
they tend to have clausal antecedents or NP an-
tecedents that were not in subject position (Pas-
sonneau, 1993). Second, they tend to refer to se-
mantically complex items for which the speaker
cannot quickly compute agreement features that
would be required for a personal pronoun (Chan-
non, 1980). Notice the subtle difference between
D0a and DOb. The demonstrative pronoun in
DOb refers to the complex object apple+napkin.
Is that object plural or singular? The demon-
strative pronoun allows the speaker to hedge:
(D0a) Put the apple on the napkin and then
move it to the side.
(DOb) Put the apple on the napkin and then
move that to the side.
Third, demonstrative pronouns tend to re-
fer to an entity not in focus (Linde, 1979).
Schuster (1988) found that her subjects inter-
preted sentences like Ela and Elb differently:
(EO) John thought about {becoming a bum}.
(Ela) It, would hurt his mother and it, would
make his father furious.
(Elb) {/t, would hurt his mother}3 and thati
would make his father furious.
The first it in Ela refers to &amp;quot;becoming a
bum&amp;quot; and thereby focuses attention on this
referent. A second it maintains that refer-
ence, while the demonstrative pronoun prefers
an unfocused entity. This contrast was formal-
ized in the Givenness Hierarchy developed by
Gundel et al. (1993), which distinguishes the in
focus status, marked by personal pronouns, from
the activated status, marked by demonstratives.
Activated entities are in short-term memory be-
cause they were mentioned in the discourse or
because they are in the physical context, but
are not currently at the center of attention.
Because of these differences, anaphoric
demonstrative pronouns have typically been
excluded from pronoun resolution stud-
ies. A notable exception is the model by
Eckert and Strube (2000), which matches
anaphoric pronouns with their antecedents
(pronouns for which no antecedent is identified
are labeled vague pronouns). This algorithm
uses the predication context of the pronoun to
label it as incompatible with either abstract
(clausal) or individual (noun phrase) referents.
For example, the pronoun in &amp;quot;That&apos;s right&amp;quot;
would be labeled individual-incompatible.
When the predication does not constrain the
pronoun, demonstratives prefer abstract refer-
ents and personal pronouns prefer individuals.
Their pronoun resolution technique is an
extension of the S-list technique (Strube,
1998), which incrementally updates the relative
salience of NP-evoked DEs based on information
structure, and judges the salience of clausal an-
tecedents using discourse structure. This model
was designed for spoken dialog, so it requires an-
tecedents to be in the discourse common ground
before they are available for anaphora resolu-
tion. This model assumes that referring func-
tions are available to coerce clausal antecedents
into the intended referents, but does not spec-
ify the details for those functions. Although not
implemented, this technique performed well in
hand-simulation on a set of Switchboard dialogs.

The DM is partitioned into two sets: Mentioned
Entities and Activated Entities. Mentioned DEs
carry the interpretation of noun phrases and are
evoked as soon as the NP is interpreted. Af-
ter interpreting each DU, which in this model
is each clause, one Mentioned DE is designated
as the focus.3 Other constituents, such as en-
tire sentences and nominals, create DE proxies
in the Activated Entities list. DE&apos;s that repre-
sent referents with no existential presupposition
(indefinites, commands, etc.) are not available
as referents until the utterance evoking them is

<bodyText confidence="0.960636465116279">
Mentioned entities All referential NP&apos;s5
create DE&apos;s with mentioned salience. This
includes proper names, descriptive NP&apos;s, and
demonstrative and 3rd-person personal, posses-
sive, and reflexive pronouns.
3This model does not commit to a particular method
of calculating the focus. For the evaluation reported in
Section 4, the left-most NP in each clause was designated
as the focus.
4A plural entity has heterogeneous semantics if its el-
ements are of different semantic types, such as a set of
engines, boxcars, and tankers.
3Constituents that function syntactically as NP&apos;s, but
that do not refer, do not evoke mentioned entities. Ex-
amples are predicate complements, frequency adverbials
and expletives (as in &amp;quot;It&apos;s good that you cleaned up&amp;quot;).
Activated entities Activated DEs, contain-
ing proxies for linguistic constituents other than
noun phrases, are evoked after interpreting each
clause. Some example rules for creating proxies
are shown in Table 1. Notice that one clause
might trigger multiple proxies. During pronoun
interpretation, a set of referring functions can
be invoked to coerce the proxy into a referent
of the desired type. Table 2 lists some example
referring functions. These functions are sensi-
tive to both the syntactic and semantic analysis
of the original constituent, as well as its speech
act. The speech acts defined in this model are:
Tell: Assert the truth of a proposition.
Request: Command one&apos;s partner to perform
an action.
WH-Question: Elicit information from one&apos;s
discourse partner.
YN-Question: Elicit confirmation of an as-
sertion from one&apos;s discourse partner.
Confirm: Accept an utterance made by one&apos;s
partner.
Speech acts are included because they de-
termine which abstract entities are available
for subsequent reference. For example, WH-
questions cannot be characterized as proposi-
tions by subsequent anaphoric reference:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.900475">

entire discourse. Activated DE&apos;s from Clausen

anaphoric mention of an abstract referent evokes
a Mentioned DE that is treated just like any

3.2 Semantic Constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989551">
Semantic type constraints for each pronoun are
determined as the first step of pronoun reso-
lution. In some contexts, the pronoun&apos;s type
is left unconstrained. For example, in &amp;quot;That&apos;s
good&amp;quot; the pronoun is the argument of ACCEPT-
ABLE(X), which can apply to any semantic
type. Semantic constraints come from:
Verb senses have associated semantic restric-
tions for each argument position. (e.g.
&amp;quot;Load them into the boxcar.&amp;quot; produces the
constraint that the theme of LOAD must
be CARGO).
Predicate NPs Be-verbs and other near-
copular constructions that are interpreted
as EQUAL constrain the subject to be the
same type as the complement. For exam-
ple: &amp;quot;That&apos;s a good route&amp;quot; constrains the
subject to be a ROUTE.
Predicate Adjectives Copulas containing
adjectives also constrain the possible se-
mantic type of a pronoun in subject po-
sition. For example, &amp;quot;it&apos;s right&amp;quot; is inter-
preted as CORRECT(X) and the argument
of CORRECT must be a PROPOSITION.

3.3 Pronoun resolution search order
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999777526315789">
Pronoun resolution is a search for the first refer-
ent that satisfies semantic type constraints and
agreement features for the pronoun. A referent
satisfies the type constraint if it is of type T or a
subtype of that type. The search through Men-
tioned entities works backwards in the order the
clauses appeared in the discourse.6 Within each
clause, Mentioned entities are searched in left-
to-right order.7 Searching the Activated entities
means applying referring functions that produce
an acceptable type of referent to each DE proxy.
The referring functions produce a referent if the
function was successful or NIL if the function
was not able to produce a referent of the desired
type from the proxy DE. Personal and demon-
strative pronouns employ different search orders.
Personal The referent of a singular pro-
noun is the first singular, individual referent
found in this order:

Walker, 1996), no method exists for building an accurate
discourse structure in realtime.

instead is a point for future work.

There is no other pronoun resolution software
that resolves non-NPC pronouns to use for com-
parison in this evalution. Eckert and Strube&apos;s
model relies on hand-annotated discourse struc-
ture, which was not available for this corpus.
Therefore, the LRC algorithm, which performs
well on NPC pronouns (Tetreault, 2001), was
chosen as the baseline. LRC uses salience only
to select NP antecedents, and treats demonstra-
tives the same as personal pronouns. Rows A
through I of Table 4 show the composition of the
evaluation corpus using the format defined in
(Byron, 2001). Pronoun resolution results start
with LRC in the row numbered 1, and the differ-
ent elements of PHORA are gradually added to
this baseline technique. LRC correctly resolved
37% of pronouns in the evaluation set.10
1Â°Only 50% of pronouns in this set are NPC, so that is
the upper limit for LRC on this data. LRC resolves 69%
of the NPC pronouns in this test set correctly, which is
Row 2 shows the improvement gained by
adding semantic type matching, which im-
proves both personal and demonstrative pro-
nouns. Row 3 shows the effect of adding ac-
tivated entities for non-NP constituents. The
success rate on demonstratives is expected to
improve, but notice that personals improve by
7% as well. Finally, the full PHORA model
is shown in Row 4. Using a different search
order for demonstrative pronouns correctly re-
solves 72%, nearly doubling the LRC baseline.
Many of the remaining errors were due to the
simplistic linear model of discourse structure.
Detecting embedded dialogs or utilizing prosody
to detect structural shifts (Hirschberg and Pier-
rehumbert, 1986), should improve performance
and is proposed as future work.
One limitation of this model is its dependence
on semantic resources. A domain-independent
evaluation was conducted by labeling seman-
tic constraints as domain-dependent or indepen-
dent (e.g. the theme of &amp;quot;that&apos;s right&amp;quot; is a propo-
sition in any domain, but the theme of &amp;quot;they
go to Avon&amp;quot; as a MOVABLE-OBJECT is spe-
cific to TRAINS93). On the same evaluation
data with only domain-independent semantics
enabled, the full PHORA model resolved 51%
of the test pronouns correctly. Applying the
model to open-domain discourse using a stan-
dard semantic resourse, such as Wordnet, is an
anticipated future direction.

5 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982384615385">
The pronoun resolution technique described
here significantly expands the range of
anaphoric pronouns that can be automati-
cally interpreted. It draws upon many previous
lines of research to allow abstract entities to be
generated as candidate referents for anaphoric
pronouns, and adds semantic filtering during
pronoun resolution to counteract this increase
in potential referents. To date, the model has
been implemented only in a closed-domain
system. However, the technique itself is not
domain-specific, and testing the technique on
open-domain discourse is a point of future work.

Most previous anaphora resolution algorithms only create DE&apos;s for the referents of NPs; but it is well known that this provides insufficient support for all anaphoric pronouns, for example (inspired by (Webber, 1988)): Fall, penguins migrate to Fiji. they wait out the winter. it&apos;s too cold even for them. I&apos;m going there next month. just before the eggs hatch. The pronouns in Ala and Alb depend only on noun phrases in AO (Fiji and Fall), but Alc refers to all of AO characterized as a fact, and the pronoun in Ald refers to the migration event. This example demonstrates that the same discourse unit (A0) can be characterized in a variety of ways by the anaphoric reference (a fact and an event in this case). These referents built from constituents other than noun phrases are Webber (1990) suggests that each discourse unit produce a pseudo-DE that &amp;quot;stands proxy for its propositional content&amp;quot;. Proxies can be coerced into different types of referents by functions 1979). Each referring function recharacterizes the discourse unit in a particular way. To interpret the pronouns in example A, two functions are needed: one that takes the proxy for AO and a fact referent, and one for the Asher (1993) details the syntactic and semantic conditions in which abstract referents are available for anaphoric reference. In dialog, Walker and Whittaker (1990) point out that once a question is asked, it remains salient until answered. As a result, in problemsolving conversations, particular aspects of the solution that are important for determining how well the proposed solution addresses the overall goal are salient even if they were not explicitly mentioned. These referents must be available &apos;Webber (1990) additionally describes a model of discourse structure that explains which discourse units are in focus at any point in the discourse, but PHORA does not employ a sophisticated model of discourse structure so those details are outside the scope of this discussion. for interpreting anaphoric pronouns. Which aspects of the problem state are salient after each action depends on the task underway. These salient aspects of the solution can be inferred using referring functions in a process similar to evoking abstract referents. For example, in the TRAINS93 domain, when the discourse participants must determine how much time the plan will take, the following exchange is typical: engine 1 to Elmira. six hours. / That&apos;ll be six p.m. DE&apos;s evoked by NP&apos;s remain in the DM for the duration of a discourse to support long-distance anaphora. Abstract entities are only available for pronominal reference in the immediately following discourse unit (Passonneau, 1991). 2.2 Pronoun Resolution Techniques Most extant algorithms operate by linking an anaphoric pronoun with the noun phrase that is judged to be its antecedent. The search is ordered either using syntactic structure (Hobbs, or an estimation of discourse salience (Brennan et al., 1987; Baldwin, 1997; Tetreault, 2001). Although different techniques use different evidence for judging salience (grammatical role, information structure, coherence structure, etc.), it is generally agreed that items that apas NP&apos;s in the sentence are most Other items, such as the situation described by the sentence, are less salient. Therefore, pronouns that refer to these less salient items are simply not addressed in the salience paradigm because they cannot be resolved correctly. The salience paradigm was originally motivated by the fact that some pronouns have more than one candidate referent with equally valid semantic properties, yet human readers do not find the sentence ambiguous. In example C from Sidner (1983, pg. 373), the pronoun in sentence Cl can refer to either the dog or the bull, but the dog is chosen because it is more focused. Sidner explains that the focused entity is chosen as the referent for a pronoun unless its semantic properties are incompatible with the predicative reader is referred to (Tetreault, 2001) for a survey and evaluation of several salience-based algorithms. context of the pronoun. When multiple entities with equal semantics are available as candidate antecedents, salience provides a useful heuristic for choosing between them. Pam walked her a day. quietly along. Relying on salience to guide pronoun interpretation does not work for demonstrative pronouns, which differ from personal pronouns along several interrelated dimensions. First, they tend to have clausal antecedents or NP antecedents that were not in subject position (Passonneau, 1993). Second, they tend to refer to semantically complex items for which the speaker cannot quickly compute agreement features that would be required for a personal pronoun (Channon, 1980). Notice the subtle difference between D0a and DOb. The demonstrative pronoun in DOb refers to the complex object apple+napkin. Is that object plural or singular? The demonstrative pronoun allows the speaker to hedge: (D0a) Put the apple on the napkin and then the side. (DOb) Put the apple on the napkin and then the side. Third, demonstrative pronouns tend to refer to an entity not in focus (Linde, 1979). Schuster (1988) found that her subjects interpreted sentences like Ela and Elb differently: (EO) John thought about {becoming a bum}. hurt his mother and make his father furious. hurt his and would make his father furious. first to &amp;quot;becoming a bum&amp;quot; and thereby focuses attention on this A second that reference, while the demonstrative pronoun prefers an unfocused entity. This contrast was formalized in the Givenness Hierarchy developed by et al. (1993), which distinguishes the marked by personal pronouns, from marked by demonstratives. Activated entities are in short-term memory because they were mentioned in the discourse or because they are in the physical context, but are not currently at the center of attention. Because of these differences, anaphoric demonstrative pronouns have typically been excluded from pronoun resolution studies. A notable exception is the model by Eckert and Strube (2000), which matches anaphoric pronouns with their antecedents (pronouns for which no antecedent is identified labeled This algorithm uses the predication context of the pronoun to label it as incompatible with either abstract (clausal) or individual (noun phrase) referents. For example, the pronoun in &amp;quot;That&apos;s right&amp;quot; would be labeled individual-incompatible. When the predication does not constrain the pronoun, demonstratives prefer abstract referents and personal pronouns prefer individuals. Their pronoun resolution technique is an extension of the S-list technique (Strube, 1998), which incrementally updates the relative salience of NP-evoked DEs based on information structure, and judges the salience of clausal antecedents using discourse structure. This model was designed for spoken dialog, so it requires antecedents to be in the discourse common ground before they are available for anaphora resolution. This model assumes that referring functions are available to coerce clausal antecedents into the intended referents, but does not specify the details for those functions. Although not implemented, this technique performed well in hand-simulation on a set of Switchboard dialogs. 3 Details of PHORA PHORA can be summarized as three steps, each of which is detailed in this section: 1. Build DE proxies for Discourse Unit (DU). To resolve each pronoun in DUnÂ±i: 2. Calculate the most general semantic type T that satisfies constraints on the predicate argument positions the pronoun appears in. 3. Test DE&apos;s in salience order to find a referent that matches the pronoun&apos;s agreement features, using different search orders for personal and demonstrative pronouns. Testing each DE involves applying the referring Table 1: Constituents that evoke activated entities (DE proxies) Trigger Constituent Example or gerund phrase load the boxcars/Loading them an hour. entire clause think that he&apos;s an alien. sentential I think that an alien. clause he&apos;s an alien... functions in an attempt to find a referent of type T or one of its subtypes. 3.1 Incrementing the Discourse Context The DM is partitioned into two sets: Mentioned Entities and Activated Entities. Mentioned DEs carry the interpretation of noun phrases and are evoked as soon as the NP is interpreted. After interpreting each DU, which in this model is each clause, one Mentioned DE is designated the Other constituents, such as entire sentences and nominals, create DE proxies in the Activated Entities list. DE&apos;s that represent referents with no existential presupposition (indefinites, commands, etc.) are not available as referents until the utterance evoking them is Confirmed. DE&apos;s have these attributes: â¢ Input: The surface linguistic constituent â¢ Number: singular or plural â¢ Type: such as ENGINE, PERSON, etc. Composition: heteroor â¢ Specificity: individual or kind â¢ Interpretation: the referent or Proxy associated with this DE entities All create DE&apos;s with mentioned salience. This includes proper names, descriptive NP&apos;s, and demonstrative and 3rd-person personal, possessive, and reflexive pronouns. model does not commit to a particular method of calculating the focus. For the evaluation reported in Section 4, the left-most NP in each clause was designated as the focus. plural entity has heterogeneous semantics if its elements are of different semantic types, such as a set of engines, boxcars, and tankers. that function syntactically as NP&apos;s, but that do not refer, do not evoke mentioned entities. Examples are predicate complements, frequency adverbials and expletives (as in &amp;quot;It&apos;s good that you cleaned up&amp;quot;). entities DEs, containing proxies for linguistic constituents other than noun phrases, are evoked after interpreting each clause. Some example rules for creating proxies are shown in Table 1. Notice that one clause might trigger multiple proxies. During pronoun interpretation, a set of referring functions can be invoked to coerce the proxy into a referent of the desired type. Table 2 lists some example referring functions. These functions are sensitive to both the syntactic and semantic analysis of the original constituent, as well as its speech act. The speech acts defined in this model are: the truth of a proposition. one&apos;s partner to perform an action. information from one&apos;s discourse partner. confirmation of an assertion from one&apos;s discourse partner. an utterance made by one&apos;s partner. Speech acts are included because they determine which abstract entities are available for subsequent reference. For example, WHquestions cannot be characterized as propositions by subsequent anaphoric reference: highway is closed (Tell) the highway closed? (Y/N Question) right. is the highway closed? (WH-Q) right. After each clause that updates the solution being constructed (TELLs and REQUESTs), a proxy DE is added for the plan. Reference functions are defined to infer salient task-related entities such as the completion time of the plan. For instance, if a sentence describes an event Table 2: Referring Functions DE / Proxy Details Any Mentioned DE if its type meets type constraint t Descriptive NP (not bare plural NP) meeting of type t Sentence with tensed stative verb Sentence with tensed eventive verb infinitive form of action/event Gerund form of action/event Each TELL or YN-Question that sentential if/when subordinate clause Sentence with tensed eventive verb Gerund or Infinitive from eventive verb Function Ident (d,t) Kind(d,t) Situation(d) Output Types Event (d) train red. KindA (d)/KindE (d) great route. Proposition(d) Endtime(d) train there load them an hour. them an hour. I think that he&apos;s an alien. think that an alien. If he&apos;s an alien... Then we go to Avon. need load the boxcars. to be added to the plan, and the task must be completed in a certain amount of time, the completion time of that task is salient. The function Endtime(d) would return a referent of type TIME-POINT denoting the end time of the event for which d is a proxy. Mentioned DE&apos;s remain in the DM for the discourse. Activated DE&apos;s from only while interpreting The anaphoric mention of an abstract referent evokes a Mentioned DE that is treated just like any other Mentioned DE. 3.2 Semantic Constraints Semantic type constraints for each pronoun are determined as the first step of pronoun resolution. In some contexts, the pronoun&apos;s type is left unconstrained. For example, in &amp;quot;That&apos;s good&amp;quot; the pronoun is the argument of ACCEPT- ABLE(X), which can apply to any semantic type. Semantic constraints come from: Verb senses have associated semantic restrictions for each argument position. (e.g. &amp;quot;Load them into the boxcar.&amp;quot; produces the constraint that the theme of LOAD must be CARGO). Predicate NPs Be-verbs and other nearcopular constructions that are interpreted as EQUAL constrain the subject to be the same type as the complement. For example: &amp;quot;That&apos;s a good route&amp;quot; constrains the subject to be a ROUTE. Predicate Adjectives Copulas containing also constrain the possible semantic type of a pronoun in subject position. For example, &amp;quot;it&apos;s right&amp;quot; is interpreted as CORRECT(X) and the argument of CORRECT must be a PROPOSITION. 3.3 Pronoun resolution search order Pronoun resolution is a search for the first referent that satisfies semantic type constraints and agreement features for the pronoun. A referent satisfies the type constraint if it is of type T or a subtype of that type. The search through Mentioned entities works backwards in the order the appeared in the Within each clause, Mentioned entities are searched in left- Searching the Activated entities means applying referring functions that produce an acceptable type of referent to each DE proxy. The referring functions produce a referent if the function was successful or NIL if the function was not able to produce a referent of the desired type from the proxy DE. Personal and demonstrative pronouns employ different search orders. Personal The referent of a singular pronoun is the first singular, individual referent found in this order: â¢ Mentioned entities to the left of the pronoun in the current clause are searched in right-to-left order The focused entity from linear order is an inaccurate model of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Webber, 1988; Walker, 1996), no method exists for building an accurate discourse structure in realtime. the breadth-first ordering of Hobbs algorithm instead is a point for future work. Table 3: DM after &amp;quot;It takes an hour to load the oranges.&amp;quot; Input Number Type Composition Specificity Interpretation Salience Engine 1 Sing ENGINE Homogeneous Indiv ENG1 focus Avon Sing CITY Homogeneous Indiv AVON mentioned the oranges Plural ORANGE Homogeneous Indiv ORANGES1 mentioned to get oranges Sing Functional Homogeneous Kind proxy activated All of GO Sing Functional Homogeneous Indiv proxy activated The plan Sing Functional Homogeneous Indiv proxy activated â¢ The remaining Mentioned entities Activated entities from pronouns, algorithm uses the same search order but looks for plural referents. If no plural entity is found, it applies the Kind(d) referring function to each Mentioned DE in an attempt to generate a Kind referent. Pronouns refer to Kinds, singular or plural referents, while refer to singular referents. The referent is the first one meeting number agreement using this search order: Activated entities from â¢ The focused entity only if it can be coerced to a Kind â¢ Mentioned DE&apos;s from the entire discourse (preferring heterogeneous ones) 3.4 An Example This section demonstrates PHORA at work. Table 3 shows the DE&apos;s evoked by CO that provide possible referents for Cl. AVON, ENC1, and ORANCES1 are objects from the referential world. MOVE and LOAD are actions. 1 goes to Avon to get the oranges. CO is interpreted as (this is an abbreviated version of the logical form): (TELL (MOVE :theme x :dest :reason (LOAD :theme w))) (the x (refers-to x ENG1)) (the y (refers-to y AVON)) (the w (refers-to w ORANGES1)) there at 3 p.m. :theme x y :time z) ARRIVE constrains its theme to be a MOVABLE-OBJECT, so the candidates are {ENC1, ORANCES1}. The search orfor ENC1 as the referent. That two hours. :theme x :cost y) TAKE-TIME constrains its theme to The search order for attempts Activated DEs first, using the function Event (d). The function is successful on the proxy for CO since MOVE is an event. the orange warehouse is. :theme x :complement x must be a LOCATION since that is type of the complement No function creates locations, so the search proceeds to Mentioned entities, and the type constraint. 4 Evaluation PHORA was evaluated on a set of ten problemsolving dialogs from the TRAINS93 corpus (Heeman and Allen, 1995). The meaning of all third-person pronouns in these dialogs had been in a previous study (Byron, The resulting dataset contains 557 utterances 180 test PHORA runs as the last step of semantic analysis in the TRIPS spoken dialog system. TRIPS&apos; grammar and lexicon coverage was extended to parse these dialogs.

Each pronoun was considered correctly resolved if both the correct antecedent and the correct referring function were chosen. All pronoun interpretation and DM construction was performed automatically by the PHORA software. 4.1 Results There is no other pronoun resolution software that resolves non-NPC pronouns to use for comparison in this evalution. Eckert and Strube&apos;s model relies on hand-annotated discourse structure, which was not available for this corpus. Therefore, the LRC algorithm, which performs well on NPC pronouns (Tetreault, 2001), was chosen as the baseline. LRC uses salience only to select NP antecedents, and treats demonstratives the same as personal pronouns. Rows A through I of Table 4 show the composition of the evaluation corpus using the format defined in (Byron, 2001). Pronoun resolution results start with LRC in the row numbered 1, and the different elements of PHORA are gradually added to this baseline technique. LRC correctly resolved of pronouns in the evaluation 50% of pronouns in this set are NPC, so that is the upper limit for LRC on this data. LRC resolves 69% of the NPC pronouns in this test set correctly, which is Row 2 shows the improvement gained by adding semantic type matching, which improves both personal and demonstrative pronouns. Row 3 shows the effect of adding activated entities for non-NP constituents. The success rate on demonstratives is expected to improve, but notice that personals improve by 7% as well. Finally, the full PHORA model is shown in Row 4. Using a different search order for demonstrative pronouns correctly resolves 72%, nearly doubling the LRC baseline. Many of the remaining errors were due to the simplistic linear model of discourse structure. Detecting embedded dialogs or utilizing prosody to detect structural shifts (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986), should improve performance and is proposed as future work. One limitation of this model is its dependence on semantic resources. A domain-independent evaluation was conducted by labeling semantic constraints as domain-dependent or independent (e.g. the theme of &amp;quot;that&apos;s right&amp;quot; is a proposition in any domain, but the theme of &amp;quot;they go to Avon&amp;quot; as a MOVABLE-OBJECT is specific to TRAINS93). On the same evaluation data with only domain-independent semantics enabled, the full PHORA model resolved 51% of the test pronouns correctly. Applying the model to open-domain discourse using a standard semantic resourse, such as Wordnet, is an anticipated future direction. comparable with its performance on other datasets. 5 Summary The pronoun resolution technique described here significantly expands the range of anaphoric pronouns that can be automatically interpreted. It draws upon many previous lines of research to allow abstract entities to be generated as candidate referents for anaphoric pronouns, and adds semantic filtering during pronoun resolution to counteract this increase in potential referents. To date, the model has been implemented only in a closed-domain system. However, the technique itself is not domain-specific, and testing the technique on open-domain discourse is a point of future work.

These referents built from constituents other than noun phrases are called abstract referents. Webber (1990) suggests that each discourse unit produce a pseudo-DE that &amp;quot;stands proxy for its propositional content&amp;quot;. Proxies can be coerced into different types of referents by applying referring functions (Nunberg, 1979). Each referring function recharacterizes the discourse unit in a particular way. To interpret the pronouns in example A, two functions are needed: one that takes the proxy for AO and creates a fact referent, and one for the event.1 Asher (1993) details the syntactic and semantic conditions in which abstract referents are available for anaphoric reference. In dialog, Walker and Whittaker (1990) point out that once a question is asked, it remains salient until answered. As a result, in problemsolving conversations, particular aspects of the solution that are important for determining how well the proposed solution addresses the overall goal are salient even if they were not explicitly mentioned. These referents must be available &apos;Webber (1990) additionally describes a model of discourse structure that explains which discourse units ar</context>

Eckert and Strube&apos;s model relies on hand-annotated discourse structure, which was not available for this corpus. Therefore, the LRC algorithm, which performs well on NPC pronouns (Tetreault, 2001), was chosen as the baseline. LRC uses salience only to select NP antecedents, and treats demonstratives the same as personal pronouns. Rows A through I of Table 4 show the composition of the evaluation corpus using the format defined in (Byron, 2001).

(CO) Pam walked her dog near a bull one day. (Cl) He trotted quietly along. Relying on salience to guide pronoun interpretation does not work for demonstrative pronouns, which differ from personal pronouns along several interrelated dimensions. First, they tend to have clausal antecedents or NP antecedents that were not in subject position (Passonneau, 1993). Second, they tend to refer to semantically complex items for which the speaker cannot quickly compute agreement features that would be required for a personal pronoun (Channon, 1980). Notice the subtle difference between D0a and DOb. The demonstrative pronoun in DOb refers to the complex object apple+napkin. Is that object plural or singular? The demonstrative pronoun allows the speaker to hedge: (D0a) Put the apple on the napkin and then move it to the side. (DOb) Put the apple on the napkin and then move that to the side. Third, demonstrative pronouns tend to refer to an entity not in focus (Linde, 1979).

Because of these differences, anaphoric demonstrative pronouns have typically been excluded from pronoun resolution studies. A notable exception is the model by Eckert and Strube (2000), which matches anaphoric pronouns with their antecedents (pronouns for which no antecedent is identified are labeled vague pronouns). This algorithm uses the predication context of the pronoun to label it as incompatible with either abstract (clausal) or individual (noun phrase) referents. For example, the pronoun in &amp;quot;That&apos;s right&amp;quot; would be labeled individual-incompatible.

Finally, the full PHORA model is shown in Row 4. Using a different search order for demonstrative pronouns correctly resolves 72%, nearly doubling the LRC baseline. Many of the remaining errors were due to the simplistic linear model of discourse structure. Detecting embedded dialogs or utilizing prosody to detect structural shifts (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986), should improve performance and is proposed as future work. One limitation of this model is its dependence on semantic resources. A domain-independent evaluation was conducted by labeling semantic constraints as domain-dependent or independent (e.g. the theme of &amp;quot;that&apos;s right&amp;quot; is a proposition in any domain, but the theme of &amp;quot;they go to Avon&amp;quot; as a MOVABLE-OBJECT is specific to TRAINS93).

This example demonstrates that the same discourse unit (A0) can be characterized in a variety of ways by the anaphoric reference (a fact and an event in this case). These referents built from constituents other than noun phrases are called abstract referents. Webber (1990) suggests that each discourse unit produce a pseudo-DE that &amp;quot;stands proxy for its propositional content&amp;quot;. Proxies can be coerced into different types of referents by applying referring functions (Nunberg, 1979). Each referring function recharacterizes the discourse unit in a particular way. To interpret the pronouns in example A, two functions are needed: one that takes the proxy for AO and creates a fact referent, and one for the event.1 Asher (1993) details the syntactic and semantic conditions in which abstract referents are available for anaphoric reference.

(Cl) He trotted quietly along. Relying on salience to guide pronoun interpretation does not work for demonstrative pronouns, which differ from personal pronouns along several interrelated dimensions. First, they tend to have clausal antecedents or NP antecedents that were not in subject position (Passonneau, 1993). Second, they tend to refer to semantically complex items for which the speaker cannot quickly compute agreement features that would be required for a personal pronoun (Channon, 1980). Notice the subtle difference between D0a and DOb. The demonstrative pronoun in DOb refers to the complex object apple+napkin. Is that object plural or singular? The demonstrative pronoun allows the speaker to hedge: (D0a) Put the apple on the napkin and then move it to the side. (DOb) Put the apple on the napkin and then move that to the side.

The first it in Ela refers to &amp;quot;becoming a bum&amp;quot; and thereby focuses attention on this referent. A second it maintains that reference, while the demonstrative pronoun prefers an unfocused entity. This contrast was formalized in the Givenness Hierarchy developed by Gundel et al.

Therefore, pronouns that refer to these less salient items are simply not addressed in the salience paradigm because they cannot be resolved correctly. The salience paradigm was originally motivated by the fact that some pronouns have more than one candidate referent with equally valid semantic properties, yet human readers do not find the sentence ambiguous. In example C from Sidner (1983, pg. 373), the pronoun in sentence Cl can refer to either the dog or the bull, but the dog is chosen because it is more focused. Sidner explains that the focused entity is chosen as the referent for a pronoun unless its semantic properties are incompatible with the predicative 2The reader is referred to (Tetreault, 2001) for a survey and evaluation of several salience-based algorithms. context of the pronoun.

This algorithm uses the predication context of the pronoun to label it as incompatible with either abstract (clausal) or individual (noun phrase) referents. For example, the pronoun in &amp;quot;That&apos;s right&amp;quot; would be labeled individual-incompatible. When the predication does not constrain the pronoun, demonstratives prefer abstract referents and personal pronouns prefer individuals. Their pronoun resolution technique is an extension of the S-list technique (Strube, 1998), which incrementally updates the relative salience of NP-evoked DEs based on information structure, and judges the salience of clausal antecedents using discourse structure. This model was designed for spoken dialog, so it requires antecedents to be in the discourse common ground before they are available for anaphora resolution. This model assumes that referring functions are available to coerce clausal antecedents into the intended referents, but does not specify the details for those functions. Although not implemented, this technique performed well in hand-simulation on a set of Switchboa</context>

Abstract entities are only available for pronominal reference in the immediately following discourse unit (Passonneau, 1991). 2.2 Pronoun Resolution Techniques Most extant algorithms operate by linking an anaphoric pronoun with the noun phrase that is judged to be its antecedent. The search is ordered either using syntactic structure (Hobbs, 1986) or an estimation of discourse salience (e.g. (Brennan et al., 1987; Baldwin, 1997; Tetreault, 2001). Although different techniques use different evidence for judging salience (grammatical role, information structure, coherence structure, etc.), it is generally agreed that items that appear as NP&apos;s in the sentence are most salient.2 Other items, such as the situation described by the sentence, are less salient.

Each pronoun was considered correctly resolved if both the correct antecedent and the correct referring function were chosen. All pronoun interpretation and DM construction was performed automatically by the PHORA software. 4.1 Results There is no other pronoun resolution software that resolves non-NPC pronouns to use for comparison in this evalution. Eckert and Strube&apos;s model relies on hand-annotated discourse structure, which was not available for this corpus. Therefore, the LRC algorithm, which performs well on NPC pronouns (Tetreault, 2001), was chosen as the baseline. LRC uses salience only to select NP antecedents, and treats demonstratives the same as personal pronouns. Rows A through I of Table 4 show the composition of the evaluation corpus using the format defined in (Byron, 2001). Pronoun resolution results start with LRC in the row numbered 1, and the different elements of PHORA are gradually added to this baseline technique. LRC correctly resolved 37% of pronouns in the evaluation set.10 1Â°Only 50% of pronouns in this set are NPC, so that is the upper limit for LRC on this data.

The pronouns in Ala and Alb depend only on noun phrases in AO (Fiji and Fall), but Alc refers to all of AO characterized as a fact, and the pronoun in Ald refers to the migration event. This example demonstrates that the same discourse unit (A0) can be characterized in a variety of ways by the anaphoric reference (a fact and an event in this case).
