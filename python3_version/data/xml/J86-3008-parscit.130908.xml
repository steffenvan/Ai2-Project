CALL FOR NOMINATIONS FOR IJCAI AWARDS
THE IJCAI AWARD FOR RESEARCH EXCELLENCE
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.99886385">
The IJCAI Award for Research Excellence is given, at
each International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelli-
gence, to a scientist who has carried out a program of
research of consistently high quality yielding several
substantial results. If the research program has been
carried out collaboratively the award may be made jointly
to the research team. The first recipient of this award
was John McCarthy in 1985.
The Award carries with it a certificate and the sum of
$1,000 plus travel and living expenses for the IJCAI. The
researcher(s) will be invited to deliver an address on the
nature and significance of the results achieved and write
a paper for the conference proceedings. Primarily,
however, the award carries the honour of having one&apos;s
work selected by one&apos;s peers as an exemplar of sustained
research in the maturing science of Artificial Intelligence.
We hereby call for nominations for The IJCAI Award
for Research Excellence to be made at IJCAI-87 in Milan.
The note on Selection Procedures for IJCAI Awards
provides the relevant details.

THE CATALOGUE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999412428571429">
The Catalogue of Artificial Intelligence Tools is a kind of
mail order catalogue of Al techniques and portable soft-
*are. Its purpose is to promote interaction between
members of the Al community. It does this by announc-
ing the existence of Al tools, and acting as a pointer into
the literature. Thus the Al community will have access to
a common, extensional definition of the field, which will:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999336333333333">
• promote a common terminology,
• discourage the reinvention of wheels, and
• act as a clearing house for ideas and software.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994537727272727">
The catalogue is a reference work providing a quick
guide to the Al tools available for different jobs. It is not
intended to be a textbook like the Artificial Intelligence
Handbook. It, intentionally, only provides a brief
description of each tool, with no extended discussion of
the historical origin of the tool or how it has been used in
particular AI programs. The focus is on techniques
abstracted from their historical origins.
The original version of the catalogue was hastily built
in 1983 as part of the UK SERC-DoI, IKBS, Architec-
ture Study. It has now been adopted by the UK Alvey
Programme and is both kept as an on-line document
undergoing constant revision and refinement and
published as a paperback by Springer Verlag. Springer
Verlag have agreed to reprint the Catalogue at frequent
intervals in order to keep it up to date.
The on-line and paperback versions of the catalogue
meet different needs and differ in the entries they
contain. In particular, the on-line version was designed
to promote UK interaction and contains all the entries we
received that meet the criteria defined below. Details of
how to access the on-line version are available from

Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 OQX
United Kingdom
The paperback version was designed to serve as a refer-
ence book for the international community, and does not
contain entries which are only of interest in a UK
context.
By &amp;quot;Al techniques&amp;quot; we mean algorithms, data (know-
ledge) formalisms, architectures, and methodological
techniques that can be described in a precise, clean way.
The catalogue entries are intended to be non-technical
and brief, but with a literature reference. The reference
might not be the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; one. It will often be to a text-
book or survey article. The border between Al and
non-AI techniques is fuzzy. Since the catalogue is to
promote interaction, some techniques are included
because they are vital parts of many Al programs, even
though they did not originate in Al.
By &amp;quot;portable Al software&amp;quot; we mean programming
languages, shells, packages, toolkits etc. available for use
by Al researchers outside the group of the implementor,
including both commercial and non-commercial products.
To obtain a copy of software, do not write to us or the
contributor of the entry; look at the &amp;quot;Availability&amp;quot; field
or write to the implementor. We hope that (s)he will
supply sufficient documentation for the system to be
used by an outsider, but do not expect non-commercial
products to be as professionally polished as commercial
ones.
We have not included in the catalogue separate entries
for each slight variation of a technique, programming
language, etc. Neither have we always included details of
how to obtain the software, nor descriptions of AI
programs tied to a particular application, nor of
descriptions of work in progress. The catalogue is not
intended to be a dictionary of Al terminology nor to
include definitions of Al problems.
Entries are short (abstract length) descriptions of a
technique or piece of software. They include a title, list
of aliases, contributor&apos;s name, paragraph of description,
information on availability and references. The contribu-
tor&apos;s name is that of the original contributor of the entry.
Only occasionally is the contributor of the entry also the
implementor of the software or the inventor of the tech-
nique. The &amp;quot;Availability&amp;quot; field or the reference is a
better guide to the identity of the implementor or inven-
tor. Some entries have been subsequently modified by
the referees and/or editorial team, and these modifica-
tions have not always been checked with the original
contributor, so (s)he should not always be held morally
responsible, and should never be held legally responsible.
If you would like to submit an entry for the catalogue
then please send the information requested below to:

TINLAP3
7-9 January 1987, New Mexico State University, Las
Cruces, New Mexieco
TINLAP3 will be the third in the series of interdisciplinary
workshops
Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing.
The format will be as in MIT (1985) and Illinois (1978):
invited panels of distinguished figures in the field will
discuss pre-circulated statements of position. Lively audi-
ence participation is anticipated. The panels are intended
to cover the major contentious issues of the moment.
TINLAP3 is being supported by the Association of
Computational Linguistics and funds are also being
sought from NSF, AAAI, and ACM.

Corridor for Technical Excellence, Computing Research
Lab. (505-646-5466) for further details.
Forming the western corner of a triangle with White
Sands and El Paso, Las Cruces, a city of about 50,000
people, is situated in southern New Mexico between the
spectacular Organ Mountains fifteen miles to the east,
and the historic Rio Grande River to the west. Two miles
west of Las Cruces, near the Rio Grande, is La Mesilla,
the old Mexican village where the Gadsden Purchase was
signed. The town square is bordered by restaurants and
shops, with Indian arts — pottery, paintings, jewelry,
baskets, and weaving.
Also nearby are the White Sands National Monument
(about 55 miles), the Carlsbad Caverns (about 160
miles), and Sierra Blanca, a 12,000 foot mountain with
fine skiing (about 130 miles; an hour and a half drive).
The weather in early January is usually clear and
sunny; temperatures are usually in the 50s in the
daytime, and the 20s at night.

<abstract confidence="0.966256027777777">ArpaNet: bundy@rutgers.arpa JANet: bundy@uk.ac.edinburgh ANNOUNCEMENTS THE CATALOGUE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS Catalogue of Artificial Intelligence Tools a kind of mail order catalogue of Al techniques and portable soft- *are. Its purpose is to promote interaction between members of the Al community. It does this by announcing the existence of Al tools, and acting as a pointer into the literature. Thus the Al community will have access to a common, extensional definition of the field, which will: • promote a common terminology, • discourage the reinvention of wheels, and • act as a clearing house for ideas and software. The catalogue is a reference work providing a quick guide to the Al tools available for different jobs. It is not to be a textbook like the Intelligence intentionally, only provides a description of each tool, with no extended discussion of the historical origin of the tool or how it has been used in particular AI programs. The focus is on techniques abstracted from their historical origins. The original version of the catalogue was hastily built in 1983 as part of the UK SERC-DoI, IKBS, Architecture Study. It has now been adopted by the UK Alvey Programme and is both kept as an on-line document undergoing constant revision and refinement and published as a paperback by Springer Verlag. Springer Verlag have agreed to reprint the Catalogue at frequent intervals in order to keep it up to date. The on-line and paperback versions of the catalogue meet different needs and differ in the entries they contain. In particular, the on-line version was designed to promote UK interaction and contains all the entries we received that meet the criteria defined below. Details of how to access the on-line version are available from</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.99631926">The paperback version was designed to serve as a reference book for the international community, and does not contain entries which are only of interest in a UK context. By &amp;quot;Al techniques&amp;quot; we mean algorithms, data (knowledge) formalisms, architectures, and methodological techniques that can be described in a precise, clean way. The catalogue entries are intended to be non-technical and brief, but with a literature reference. The reference might not be the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; one. It will often be to a textbook or survey article. The border between Al and non-AI techniques is fuzzy. Since the catalogue is to promote interaction, some techniques are included because they are vital parts of many Al programs, even though they did not originate in Al. By &amp;quot;portable Al software&amp;quot; we mean programming languages, shells, packages, toolkits etc. available for use by Al researchers outside the group of the implementor, including both commercial and non-commercial products. obtain a copy of software, do to us or the contributor of the entry; look at the &amp;quot;Availability&amp;quot; field or write to the implementor. We hope that (s)he will supply sufficient documentation for the system to be used by an outsider, but do not expect non-commercial products to be as professionally polished as commercial ones. We have not included in the catalogue separate entries for each slight variation of a technique, programming language, etc. Neither have we always included details of how to obtain the software, nor descriptions of AI programs tied to a particular application, nor of descriptions of work in progress. The catalogue is not intended to be a dictionary of Al terminology nor to include definitions of Al problems. Entries are short (abstract length) descriptions of a technique or piece of software. They include a title, list of aliases, contributor&apos;s name, paragraph of description, information on availability and references. The contributor&apos;s name is that of the original contributor of the entry. Only occasionally is the contributor of the entry also the implementor of the software or the inventor of the technique. The &amp;quot;Availability&amp;quot; field or the reference is a better guide to the identity of the implementor or inventor. Some entries have been subsequently modified by the referees and/or editorial team, and these modifications have not always been checked with the original contributor, so (s)he should not always be held morally responsible, and should never be held legally responsible. If you would like to submit an entry for the catalogue then please send the information requested below to:</abstract>

Forming the western corner of a triangle with White Sands and El Paso, Las Cruces, a city of about 50,000 people, is situated in southern New Mexico between the spectacular Organ Mountains fifteen miles to the east, and the historic Rio Grande River to the west. Two miles west of Las Cruces, near the Rio Grande, is La Mesilla, the old Mexican village where the Gadsden Purchase was signed. The town square is bordered by restaurants and shops, with Indian arts — pottery, paintings, jewelry, baskets, and weaving. Also nearby are the White Sands National Monument (about 55 miles), the Carlsbad Caverns (about 160 miles), and Sierra Blanca, a 12,000 foot mountain with fine skiing (about 130 miles; an hour and a half drive). The weather in early January is usually clear and sunny; temperatures are usually in the 50s in the daytime, and the 20s at night. NOTE The full program will be mailed to all registrants in September and the preprints in December. Detailed accommodation and travel information will be sent on receipt of completed registration form. Hotel rates will be from $20-$50 per night. Since accommodation may be limited, it is advisable to register early, to obtain hotel information.</abstract>
