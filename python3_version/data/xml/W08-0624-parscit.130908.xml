Since scientific journals are still the most important
means of documenting biological findings, biomed-
ical articles are the best source of information we
have on protein-protein interactions. The mining of
this information will provide us with specific knowl-
edge of the presence and types of interactions, and
the circumstances in which they occur.
There are various linguistic constructions that can
describe a protein-protein interaction, but in this pa-
per we will focus on subject-verb-object construc-
tions. If a certain protein is mentioned in the sub-
ject of a sentence, and another protein in the ob-
ject, we assume in this paper that some interaction is
described between those proteins. The verb phrase
that links the subject and object together plays an
important role in this. However, there are a great
many different verbs in the English language that
can be used in a description of a protein-protein in-
teraction. Since it is practically impossible to manu-
ally determine the specific biomedical meanings for
all of these verbs, we try to determine these mean-
ings automatically. We define two classes of protein-
protein interactions, causal and non-causal, and us-
ing a Naive Bayesian Classifier, we predict for a
given verb in which class it belongs. This process
is a first step in automatically creating a useful net-
work of interacting proteins out of information from
biomedical journals.

The protein-protein interactions we are interested in
are described in the subject, the object and the in-
terlinking verb phrase of a sentence. To determine
which parts of the sentence make up this construc-
tion, we need to preprocess the sentence. For this,
we use the Genia Chunker1 to break the sentence
into different chunks (in particular we are interested
in noun phrases and verb phrases). We combine
this information with the result of the Stanford De-
pendency Parser2 to determine how these different
chunks (phrases) are connected to each other.

The subject-verb-object construction can be
schematically represented as follows:
[(state of) protein] [verb] [(state of) protein]
We make a distinction between two classes of
verbs. One class describes a strict causal relation
and the other covers all other types of meanings
(non-causal). Table 1 shows some example verbs
for the two classes.

Since we leave out the information of the states

positive, negative and neutral causal relations. The

correlation (interact), but also verbs such as require

tionship, but not specifically a causal one.
We use a Naive Bayesian Classifier to estimate
the probability P(ci|V ) that a given verb belongs to
a certain class. In the retrieved subject-verb-object
constructions, such a verb V will occur a number
of times, each time in combination with a specific
ordered pair of proteins ppj, one in the subject and
one in the object. Each pair ppj independently con-
tributes to the estimation of P(ci|V ).

To test our approach, we retrieved a set of subject-
verb-object relations from PubMed. We choose to
test our approach on yeast proteins rather than e.g.
human proteins to avoid Named Entity Recognition
problems.
To get rid of any excess information, the verb
phrases are normalized. We assume the last verb
in the phrase to be the relevant verb and check the
direction of the relation (active or passive form of
that verb). Finally, the verb is stemmed. For those
verbs that are in the passive form, the order of the
protein pairs around it was reversed, and, for simpli-
fication, verb phrases that describe a negation were
removed. More than one protein can occur in the
subject and/or object, so we count each possible pair
as an occurrence around the particular verb.
We used the 6 verbs as shown in Table 1 as a start-
ing set to test the classifier. They represent the dif-
ferent types within each class, and of these it is clear
they belong in that specific class. By using Word-
Net3 we can augment this set. Table 1 shows the
results of the different tests, using different param-
eter settings in WordNet to augment the training set
(‘l1’ means recursive level 1, ‘s2’ means WordNet
senses 1 to 2, ‘sa’ means all WordNet senses are
taken). It contains the number of verbs classified in
the leave-one-out cross validation (V), the number
of verbs that were correctly classified (C), the preci-
sion (P = CV ) and the probability Q that a random

Given an appropriate set of known verbs, we can
predict the meanings of unknown verbs with reason-
able confidence. This automatic prediction is very
useful, since it is infeasible to manually determine
the meanings of all possible verbs. We used two
classes of verbs, making the distinction between re-
lations that describe proteins affecting other proteins
(causal relation) and any other relation (non-causal
relation). Verbs like require and bind describe bi-
ologically distinct interactions however, and prefer-
ably should be put into classes separate from gen-
eral correlations. We chose to use a two-way dis-
tinction as a first step however, which was still bio-
logically relevant. In order to create a more detailed
network of interacting proteins, one can take these
other types into account as well.
Furthermore, it would be useful to separate the
causal relationship into positive and negative rela-
tions. This specific distinction however is not just
described in the connecting verb, but also in possi-
ble state descriptions in the noun phrases. Further
research is necessary to extract these descriptions
from the text. Finally, it would be useful to look
at different syntactical constructions, other than just
subject and object.
