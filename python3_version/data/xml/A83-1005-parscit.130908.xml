<bodyText confidence="0.999701956521739">
Constructing natural language interfaces to
computer systems often requires achievment of ad-
vanced reasoning and expert capabilities in addition
to basic natural language understanding. In this pa-
per the above issues are faced in the frame of an
actual application concerning the design of a natu-
ral language interface for the access to online in-
formation retrieval systems. After a short discus -
sion of the peculiarities of this application, which
requires both natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, the general architecture and
fundamental design criteria of a system presently
being developed at the University of Udine are then
presented. The system, named IR-NLI, is aimed at al-
lowing non-technical users to directly access through
natural language the services offered by online da-
ta bases. Attention is later focused on the basic
functions of IR-NLI, namely, understanding and dia-
logue, strategy generation, and reasoning. Knowledge
represenetation methods and Lagorithms adopted are
also illustarted. A short example of interaction
with IR-NLI is presented. Perspectives and directions
for future research are also discussed.

I INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98085362">
Natural language processing has developed in
the last years in several directions that often go
far beyond the original goal of mapping natural lan-
guage expressions into formal internal representa -
:ions. Problems concerned with discourse modeling,
reasoning about beliefs, knowledge and wants of
sneaker and hearer, expiicitely dealing with goals,
plans, and speech acts are only a few of the topics
of current interest in the field. This paper is con-
:erned with one aspect of natural language processing
:hat we name here reasoning. It is intended as a ba-
sic activity in natural language comprehension that
is aimed at capturing speaker&apos;s goals and inten -
tions that often lie behind the mere literal mea-
ning of the utterance. In this work we explore the
main implications of reasoning in the frame of an
actual application which is concerned with the na-
tural language acces to online information retrie-
val services (Politt,1981; Waterman,1978).
In particular, we shall present the detailed
design of a system, named IR-NLI (Information Re-
trieval Natural Language Interface), that is being
developed at the University of Udine and we shall
discuss its main original features. The topic of
natural language reasoning is first shortly illu-
strated from a conceptual point of view and compa-
red to related proposals. The main features of the
chosen application domain are then described and
the specifications of IR-NLI are stated. We later
turn to the architecture of the system and we go
further into a detailed account of the structure of
its knowledge bases and of its mode of operation.
Particular attention id devoted to the three funda-
mental modules STARTEGY GENERATOR, REASONING, and
UNDERSATNDING AND DIALOGUE. A sample search session
with IR-NLI concludes the illustarion of the pro-
ject. A critical evaluation of the work is then pre-
sented, and main lines of the future development
the project are outlined with particular attention
to original research issues.
II NATURAL LANGUAGE =ERETANDING AND REASONING
Research in natural langage processint: has
come in the last years a highly multidisciplinary
topic, in which artificial intelligence, ccmputati
nal linguistic, cognitive science, psychology, ano
logic share a wide set of common intrests. In tni3
frame, reasoning is not a new issue. The meaning
that we attach to this term in tile :ontext fthis
also with : Milan Polytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project, Milano, Italy.
also with : CISM, International Center for Mechanical Sciences, Udine, Italy.
</bodyText>

work is, nevertheless original. We distinguish in
the natural language comprehension activity between
a surface comprehension that only aims at represen-
ting the literal content of a natural language ex -
pression into a formal internal representation, and
a ieep comprehension that moves beyond surface mea-
ning to capture the goals and intentions which lie
behind the utterance (Grosz,I979; Hobbs,1979; Allen,
?errault,I980). The process that brings from surfa-
ce to deep comprehension is just what we name here
reasoning activity. Differntly from Winograd (1980),
reasoning is not , in our model, something that ta-
kes place after understanding is completed and aims
at developing deductions on facts and concepts
acquired. Reasoning is a basic part of deep compre-
hension and involves not only linguistic capabili-
ties lunderstanding and dialogue) but also deduc -
tion, induction, analogy, generalization, etc., on
common sense and domain specific knowledge. Figure
I presents a graphic representation of the basic
relationships between understanding and reasoning,
and clearly shows how reasoning moves the internal
representation of an utterance from a first point,
oorresuonding to surface coprehension, to a second
one that represents jeep comprehension.
:n the application of online information retrie-
val that we face in this work,the above concepts are
:onsidered in the frame of man-machine communica -
:ion, and reasoning will mostly be concerned with
terminology, as we shall further explore in the next
section.

<bodyText confidence="0.999710418604651">
:n this section we present an application domain
where the topic of natural language reasoning plays
a fundamental role, namely, aatural language access
to online information retrieval services. As it is
well known, online services allow interested users
to solve information problems by selecting and re-
trieving relevant doLuments stored in very large bi-
bliographic or factual data bases. .3eneraily end-users
are unwilling or unable] to serach personally and
lirectly access :hese large files, but they often
rely on the assistance of a skilful information pro-
fessional, the intermediary, whc H._ws how to select
appropriate data bases and ho.. to design good search
startegies for the retrieval of the desired informa-
tion, and how to implement them in a suitable formal
luery language. &apos;jsually, the interaction between end-
and intermediary begins with a presearch inter-
71&apos;,/ aimed at precisely clarifying the content and
objectives of the Information need. On tha base
of the information gathered, the interemdiary chooses
the most suitable data bases and, with the nelp of
seraching referral aids such as thesauri, directo-
ries, etc., he devises the search strategy to be
executed by the information retrieval system. :he
output of the search is then evaluated by the end-
user, who may propose a refinement and an interac-
tion of the search for better matching his requests.
We claim that the intermediary&apos;s :ask represents
a good example of the issues of natural language rea-
soning, particularly for what concerns the ability of
understanding natural language user&apos;s requests ani :f
reasoning on their linguistic and semantic ni.ance.,,
in order to fully 2apture user&apos;s neeas Ind goals.
Besides, it has to be stressed that the intermediary
should also posses other important skills,
expertise and precise knowledge about data base can-
ten-i, organization, and indexing criteria, about
availability and use of searching referral aiis,about
system query languages and access procedures, and
Last about how to plot and construct an adequate
search strategy. The above illustrated
motivate the design of a natural language expert sy-
stem for interfacing online data bases. :n fact, the

IV THE IR-NLI SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968832267857143">
IR-Nla is conceived as an interactive interface
to online information retrieval system supporting
English language interaction. It should be able to
manage a dialogue with the user on his information
needs and to construct an appropiate search strategy.
More precisely, IR-MLI is aimed at meeting the needs
of non-technical users who are not acquainted with on
line searching. For this purpose three different ca-
pabilities are requested. First, the system has to
be an expert of online searching,i.e. it must embed
knowledge of the intermediary&apos;s professional skill.
Second, it must be able of understanding natural lan-
guage and of carrying on the dialogue with the user.
Third, it has to be capable of reasoning on langua-
ge in order to capture the information needs of the
user and to formulate them with appropriate terms in
a given formal query language.
In the current first phase of the project we
have considered a set of working hypotheses for IR-
NLI :
- it operates on just one data base;
- it utilizes only one query language;
- it refers to only one subject domain;
- it is conceived only for off-line use without in-
teraction with the data base during the search
session.
fire suitable sequences of understanding, dialogue,
and reasoning functions until the internal repre.-
sentation of the user&apos;s requests is completely ex-
panded and validated.
The UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE module is devo-
ted to perform activities mostly of linguistic con-
cern. First, it has to translate the natural langu-
age user&apos;s requests into a basic formal internal re-
presentation (IR). Second, it manages the dialogue
with the user by generating appropriate queries and
by translating his replays,thus expanding the IN with
new information. The UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE ao-
dule utilizes for its operation a base of linguistic
knowledge (LK).
The REASONING module is aimed at reasoning on
IR in order to enlarge its content with all the in-
formation required to generate an appropiate search
strategy. It utilizes for this task a base .of domain
specific knowledge (DSK).
The FORMALIZER module, after the STRATEGY GENE-
RATOR has completed its activity, constructs from
the IN the output search strategy to be executed for
accessing the online data base. The FORMALIZER utili
ass for its operation knowledge about the formal Ian
guage needed to interrogate the online data base and
operates through a simple syntax-directed schema. it
is conceived as a parametric translator capable
of producing search strategies in several languages
for accessing online services, such as SDC ORBIT,
Euronet DIANE, Lockheed DIALOG, etc.

The general architecture designed for the IR-
NLI system is shown in Figure 2. The kernel of the
system is constituted by the 6ThAll:tit GENERATOR,
which is devoted to devise the top-level choices con-
cerning the overall operation of the system and to
2cntrol their execution. It utilizes for its acti-
7ity a base of excert knowledge (a) which concerns
the evaluation of user&apos;s requests, the managament
of the presearch interview, the selection of a sui-
table approach for generation of the search strate-
gy, and suheduling of the activities of the lower
Level modules UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE, REASONING,

pert rules, that apply to different situations and

VI KNOWLEDGE BASES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996425757142857">
In this section we shall illustrate the main
features of the three knowledge bases utilized by
the IR-NLI system.
Let us begin with DSK. The purpose of this know
ledge base is to store information about the domain
covered by the online data base to which IR-NLI re-
fers. This information presents two aspects : a se-
mantic facet concerning what concepts are in the da-
ta base and how they relate to each other, and a lin-
guistic one concerning how the concepts are curren-
tly expressed through appropriate terms. The struc-
ture of DSK proposed reflects and generalizes to
some extent that of classical searching referral
aids (in particular, thesauri and subject classi-
fications). At a logical level, it is constituted
by a labelled directed network in which nodes re-
present concepts and directed arcs represent rela-
tions between concepts. Each node contains a term,
a flag denoting whether the term is controlled or
not, a field that stores the posting count, i.e.
the number of items in the data base in which the
term appear, and a level number which represents
the degree of specificity of the term in a hirar-
:hicai subject classification. Arcs gnerally denote
the usual cross-reference relationships utilized
for structuring thesauri; e.g., BT (broader term),
NT (narrower term), RT (related term), UF (used for).
:n addition, arcs of type next are provided that al-
low, in connection with the level numbers of nodes,
a sequential scanning of the knowledge base accor-
iing to the currently utilized hierarchical subject
•Lassification. This structure is conceived to be
directly obtained (possibly in a partially automa-
tic way through appropriate data conversion programs)
from available searching referral aids and online
thesauri.
Let us turn now to LK. This knowledge base is
aimed at supplying all information concerning natu-
ral language that is needed to understand user&apos;s re-
luests. According to the mode of operation of the
=DERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE module (see section IX),
it contains the lexicon of the application domain
which Is currently considered. Each record of the
Lexicon contains a word of the language, its sem,a1-
- tyce concept, connective, function, and its
meaning. The semantic type denotes the role of a
word in a sentence; namely:
- denoting a term of the data base;
- defining a particular relation betwocen different
concepts in user&apos;s requests;
- specifying a particular function that the user de-
sires to obtain from the information retrieval
cyst em
The meaning of a word may be expressed as a pointer
to a term of the DSK in the case of a word of type
concept, as a special purpose procedure in the ca-
se of a connective or a function.
Let us note that,in order to avoid =useful
duplication of information in the DSK and LK, a sha-
red directory of entry words may be utilized f:r
both bases.
The purpose of EK is to contain information
that concerns the professional expertise of the in-
termediary on how to manage a search session in or-
der to appropriately satisfy the information needs
of the end-user. Its content is made up of several
classes of rules concerning the different kinds of
activities performed during a search session. The
general structure of the rules is of the classical
type IF-THEN.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.933005" genericHeader="method">
VII STRATEGY GENERATOR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.795994">
The task of the STRATEGY GENERATOR can be con-
sidered from two different points of view :
- an external one, that concerns performing inter-
mediary&apos;s activity;
- an internal one, that relates to management and
control of REASONING and UNDERSTANDING AND DIALO-
GUE modules.
On the base of these specifications, it must embed
expert capabilities and behave as a consultation
system for information retrieval ;Politt,1927 The
basic mode of operation of this module is organized
around the following four main steps that reflect
the usual practice of online information searching
(Lancaster,1979; Meadow, Cochrane,1981:.

1. perform presearch interview
2. select approach

4. construct search startegy.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996828">
The IS adopted is unique throughput the whole
operation of the system and it is constituted by a
frame, initialized by the UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE
module,and then further refined and expanded oy the
reasoning module. This frame is structural ints
frames in such a way to contain, classified under
different headings, any information that Le rele-
vant for searching an online data &apos;case, and
an effective pattern-matching for the selection of
search approaches and tactics. More specifically,
encompasses terminology about concepts and facets
present in user&apos;s requests, .:1-.,.-ifioations about
search constraints and output format, and figures
about search objectives such as recall and precision
(Meadow, Cochr.,ne,1981!.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997932">
34
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99961536">
To go further in our description, let us introduce
precise definitions of two technical terms above
used in an informal way :
search approach : the abstract way of facing a search
problem, reasoning on it, analyzing its facets, and
devising a general mode of operation for having ac-
cess to desired information stored in an online da-
ta base;
search tactic : a move, a single step or action, in
the execution of a search approach.
Let us recall that a search strategy is a program,
written in an appropriate formal query language, for
obtaining desired information from an online system;
taking into account the two above definitions a
search strategy can be viewed as the result ,f tlde
execution of a search approach through application
of appropriate search tactics.
Within IR-NLI, a search approach is represen-
ted as an algorithm that defines which tactics to
utilize, among the available ones, and how to use
them in the construction of a strategy. An approach
is not however a fixed procedure, since it does not
specify at each step which particular tactic to
execute, but only suggests a set of candidate tac-
tics, whose execution may or may not be fired.
Tactics are represented at two different levels
of abstraction :
- an high-level representation &lt;name, objectives&gt;
provided for use by the STRATEGY GENERATOR;
- a low-level representation &lt;name,reasoning actions&gt;
supplied for use by the REASONING module.
About 15 tactics are considered, taken from the ve-
ry rich discussion by Bates (1979) : CORRECT, CUT,
SELECT, EXHAUST, REDUCE, PARALLEL, PINPOINT, BLOCK,
SUPER, SUB, RELATE, NEIGHBOUR, FIX, RESPELL, RESPA-
etc.
The operation of the STRATEGY GENERATOR is ba-
sically pattern-directed; namely, the particular
activities to be performed and the way in which UN-
DE:ZTANDING AND DIALOGUE and REASONING modules are
activated are determined by the content of the cur-
rent :R &apos;or of some parts of it), which is matched
with an appropriate subset of the expert rules. In
this way its mode of operation is not strictly de-
terminate : some activities may or may not be fired
.r may be performed in different ways according to
the results of the pat:ern-matching algorithm.
-The ..ctivity of the STRATEGY GENERATOR can now
be repr-,sented in a more detailed way through the
following high-level program :

As already mentioned in section IV, in the
first version of IR-NLI the off-line operation
the system lead us to consider only the building
block approach; future versions of the system will
encompass also other classical and commonly utili-
zed approaches such as successive fraction, zita -
tion pearl growing, most specific facet first, !t:.
(Meadow, Cochrane,1981), that are more suitable fi-r
an on-line operation of the system in which di:act
interaction with the data base luring the search
session is allowed.
VIII REASONING
The REASONING module operates on the :R and is
aimed at precisely capturing user&apos;s goals and needs
through deductive and inferential processes.
specifically, the REASONING L,odule has the main
task of executing the tactics fired by the STRATE-
GY GENERATOR. Hence, from this point of view, it
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998304">
35
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996665692307693">
represents the actuator of the reasoning process
devised by the STRATEGY GENERATOR.
:t utilizes the low-level representation of
the tactics, which specifies suitable reasoning ac-
tions expressed in terms of :
- accessing DSK;
- updating the IN with the new information.
Among the basic capabilitis of the RESONING mo-
dule we consider generalization to broader terms,
extension to related concepts, particularization
to narrower terms, analysis of synonymi and homo-
nymi, etc. Its operation is based on special-pur-
pose procedures that correspond to the reasoning
actions involved in the tactics. Furthermore,
when an action has to be performed on IN for ex-
tending its content, validation may be requested
from the user in order to ensure a correct mat-
ching betwwen his wants and system proposals. This
is done through the UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE mo-
dule which has to gather user&apos;s agreement about
the new terms to be introduced in the IN.
For what concerns the dialogue function, it
relies on two strictly connected activities :
- generation of a query, according to some re:uests
from the STRATEGY GENERATOR 3r RE;ZONING modules,
thcro%zgh assembly and completing of parametric text
fragments stored in the UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE
module;
- understanding of the user&apos;s answer and refinement,
i.e. validation, updating or completing, of the
current IN.
Let us stress that, according to the basic goal-
oriented conception of the parsing mechanism of
UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE module, the understan-
ding activity performed in the frame of the dialo-
gue function is strongly directed by knowledge of
the query that the system has asked the user and,
therefore, of expected information to be captured
in the answer.

<bodyText confidence="0.999858352941176">
The purpose of the UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE
module is twofold :
- to translate users requests into IR;
- to generate queries to the user and to understand
:lie answers, i.e. to manage a bounded scope dia-
logue.
The conception of this module strongly relies,
for what concerns he understanding function, (..n
the experience previously developed by the authors
with NLI project, and is organized around the con-
cepts of semantics-directed and goal-oriented par-
sing &apos;Guida,Tasso,1982a),Its mode of operation is
mainly rule-based : a main parsing algorithm per-
forms the most elementary steps of the analysis
search in the lexicon, construction of a basic
tentative internal representation, validation of
basic internal i.epresentation), and manages a
pattern-directed invocation of heuristic rules for
reso.ution of critioal events &apos;e.g., ambiguities,
sllitpes, anaphoric references, indirect speech,
-;.c.:.An important feature of the understanding fun-
it the ability 7...) splve critical situations
by engaging the user in a clarification dialogue
activated by some of the above mentioned heuristic
rules, to gather additional information which is
necessary to correctly understand the input natu-
ral language requests.
In this section we present a short example of
the basic mode of operation of IR-NL:. Figure 3
shows a sample session in which, in addition to
the user-system dialogue, parts of the IR and the
search strategy generated (in Euronet DAN URO-
LANGUAGE) are reported. The example refers to the
domain of computer science.

BISBLE (Bates,1979)) and reasoning actions, that
enable the system to keep track of previous search
sessions and to analogize from experience in de-
vising and executing a search approach.

<abstract confidence="0.995595708333333">Constructing natural language interfaces to computer systems often requires achievment of adreasoning and expert capabilities to basic natural language understanding. In this paper the above issues are faced in the frame of an actual application concerning the design of a natural language interface for the access to online information retrieval systems. After a short discus sion of the peculiarities of this application, which requires both natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, the general architecture and fundamental design criteria of a system presently being developed at the University of Udine are then presented. The system, named IR-NLI, is aimed at allowing non-technical users to directly access through natural language the services offered by online data bases. Attention is later focused on the basic functions of IR-NLI, namely, understanding and dialogue, strategy generation, and reasoning. Knowledge represenetation methods and Lagorithms adopted are also illustarted. A short example of interaction with IR-NLI is presented. Perspectives and directions for future research are also discussed.</abstract>

We distinguish in the natural language comprehension activity between a surface comprehension that only aims at representing the literal content of a natural language ex - pression into a formal internal representation, and a ieep comprehension that moves beyond surface meaning to capture the goals and intentions which lie behind the utterance (Grosz,I979; Hobbs,1979; Allen, ?errault,I980). The process that brings from surface to deep comprehension is just what we name here reasoning activity. Differntly from Winograd (1980), reasoning is not , in our model, something that takes place after understanding is completed and aims at developing deductions on facts and concepts acquired. Reasoning is a basic part of deep comprehension and involves not only linguistic capabilities lunderstanding and dialogue) but also deduc - tion, induction, analogy, generalization, etc., on common sense and domain specific knowledge. Figure I presents a graphic representation of the basic relationships between understanding and reasoning, and clearly shows how reasoning moves the internal representation of an utterance from a first po</context>
