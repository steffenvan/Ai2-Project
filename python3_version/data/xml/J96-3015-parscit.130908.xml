&amp;quot;We... recommend this book to anyone
interested in computational phonology&amp;quot;
—Computational Linguistics
Computational phonology is one of the
newest areas of computational linguistics,
and is experiencing rapid growth as its
practitioners apply the wealth of theories,
technologies and methodologies of
computational linguistics to phonology.
This book is the first to survey these
developments, and it does so in a way
that is accessible to computational
linguists, phonologists and computer
scientists alike.

the current frameworks for syntactic
description have evolved to differ from
it. The volume also provides a context

It&apos;s about time
Temporal aspects of cognitive
processes in text production
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992394304347826">
Amsterdam/Atlanta, GA 1996. 354 pp.
(Utrecht Studies in Language and Communication 6)
ISBN: 90-5183-947-2 Hfl. 100,-/US-$ 67.-
A central issue of cognitive studies of text production is &amp;quot;What goes on
in people&apos;s minds when they produce a text?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How do they plan the
text?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How do they decide in what order to express their thoughts?&amp;quot;
In this volume, writers are followed in their footsteps during the
moment-to-moment process of producing routine business letters. Their
writing processes are explored in real time with the ultimate goal to
contribute to a cognitive theory of text production. Such a theory
should tell what kind of mental structures underly text production, how
these structures are converted into coherent texts, and how this process
is framed within real writing time.
The study starts from a large corpus of real-life text production
processes. It combines methods to explore both process and product of
text production. Processes are described by analyzing the pause
patterns that emerge in the course of writing. Products are described by
analyzing their hierarchical structure. Together, these descriptions yield
several significant insights in the real time organization of cognitive
processes in production.
The study can be characterized as a cognitive linguistic approach to
text production. This volume will be of special interest to researchers in
the field of (psycho-)-linguistics, textlinguistics and cognitive science.

Pragmatics &amp; Cognition is an interdisciplinary journal that focuses on the
interrelations between mental activity and the use of semiotic (incl. linguistic)
systems by human, animals or machines. Its scope covers a wide variety of semiotic
systems as related to a broad range of forms of mental life:

• natural language • pattern recognition

Pragmatics &amp; Cognition seeks to explore relations of all sorts between the former

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9858105">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.965812">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974904375">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.

Their processes are explored in time the ultimate goal to contribute to a cognitive theory of text production. Such a theory should tell what kind of mental structures underly text production, how these structures are converted into coherent texts, and how this process is framed within real writing time. The study starts from a large corpus of real-life text production processes. It combines methods to explore both process and product of text production. Processes are described by analyzing the pause patterns that emerge in the course of writing. Products are described by analyzing their hierarchical structure. Together, these descriptions yield several significant insights in the real time organization of cognitive processes in production. The study can be characterized as a cognitive linguistic approach to text production. This volume will be of special interest to researchers in the field of (psycho-)-linguistics, textlinguistics and cognitive science.</abstract>

The paper</note>
<abstract confidence="0.98891847368421">should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. to the Editor: category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.696191">Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
