This paper presents a method for con-
structing a large-scale Person Ontology
with category hierarchy from Wikipe-
dia. We first extract Wikipedia category
labels which represent person (hereafter,
Wikipedia Person Category, WPC) by
using a machine learning classifier. We
then construct a WPC hierarchy by de-
tecting is-a relations in the Wikipedia
category network. We then extract the
titles of Wikipedia articles which
represent person (hereafter, Wikipedia
person instance, WPI). Experiments
show that the accuracy of WPC extrac-
tion is 99.3% precision and 98.4% re-
call, while that of WPI extraction is
98.2% and 98.6%, respectively. The ac-
curacies are significantly higher than
the previous methods.

<bodyText confidence="0.998956907407408">
In recent years, we have become increasingly
aware of the need for, up-to-date knowledge
bases offering broad coverage in order to im-
plement practical semantic inference engines
for advanced applications such as question
answering, summarization and textual entail-
ment recognition. General ontologies, such as
WordNet (Fellbaum et al., 1998), and Nihongo
Goi-Taikei (Ikehara et al., 1997), contain gen-
eral knowledge of wide range of fields. How-
ever, it is difficult to instantly add new know-
ledge, particularly proper nouns, to these gen-
eral ontologies. Therefore, Wikipedia has
come to be used as a useful corpus for know-
ledge extraction because it is a free and large-
scale online encyclopedia that continues to be
actively developed. For example, in DBpedia
(Bizer et al. 2009), RDF triples are extracted
from the Infobox templates within Wikipedia
articles. In YAGO (Suchanek et al. 2007), an
appropriate WordNet synset (most likely cate-
gory) is assigned to a Wikipedia category as a
super-category, and Wikipedia articles are ex-
tracted as instances of the category.
As a first step to make use of proper noun
and related up-to-date information in Wikipedia,
we focus on person names and the articles and
categories related to them because it contains a
large number of articles and categories that in-
dicate person, and because large-scale person
ontology is useful for applications such as per-
son search and named entity recognition. Ex-
amples of a person article are personal name
and occupational title such as “Ichiro” and “Fi-
nancial planner,” while an example of a person
category is occupational title such as
“Sportspeople.”
The goal of this study is to construct a large-
scale and comprehensive person ontology by
extracting person categories and is-a relations1
among them. We first apply a classifier based
on machine learning to all Wikipedia categories
to extract categories that represent person. If
both of the linked Wikipedia categories are per-
son categories, the category link is labeled as
an is-a relation. We then use a heuristic-based
rule to extract the title of articles that represent
person as person instance from the person cate-
gories.
In the following sections, we first describe
the language resources and the previous works.
We then introduce our method for constructing
the person ontology and report our experimen-
tal results.

<bodyText confidence="0.999843875">
Wikipedia is a free, multilingual, on-line en-
cyclopedia that is being actively developed by a
large number of volunteers. Wikipedia has ar-
ticles and categories. The data is open to the
public as XML files2. Figure 1 shows an exam-
ple of an article. An article page has a title,
body, and categories. In most articles, the first
sentence of the body is the definition sentence
of the title. Although the Wikipedia category
system is organized in a hierarchal manner, it is
a thematic classification, not a taxonomy. The
relation between category and subcategory and
that between a category and articles listed on it
are not necessarily an is-a relation. A category
could have two or more super categories and
the category network could have loops.

2.2 Nihongo Goi-Taikei

<bodyText confidence="0.997130071428572">
To construct the ontology, we first apply a ma-
chine learning based classifier to determine if a
category label indicates a person or not. A Wi-
kipedia category label is often a common com-
pound noun or a noun phrase, and the head
word of a Japanese compound noun and noun
phrase is usually the last word. We assume the
semantic category of the last word is an impor-
tant feature for classification.
Nihongo Goi-Taikei (hereafter, Goi-Taikei)
is one of the largest and best known Japanese
thesauri. Goi-Taikei contains different semantic
category hierarchies for common nouns, proper
nouns, and verbs. In this work, we use only the

common noun category (Figure 2). It consists
of approximately 100,000 Japanese words (he-
reafter, instance) and the meanings of each
word are described by using about 2,700 hie-
rarchical semantic categories. Words (In-
stances) with multiple meanings (ambiguous
words) are assigned multiple categories in Goi-
Taikei. For example, the transliterated Japanese
word (instance) raita ( ラ イ タ ー ) has two
meanings of “writer” and “lighter,” and so be-
longs to two categories, “353:author 3 ” and
“915:household.”
Japanese WordNet (approximately 90,000
entries as of May 2010), which has recently
been released to the public (Bonds et al., 2008),
could be an alternative to Goi-Taikei as a large-
scale Japanese thesaurus. We used Goi-Taikei
in this work because Japanese WordNet was
translated from English WordNet and it is not
known whether it covers the concepts unique to
Japanese.

3.1 Ponzetto’s method and Sakurai’s me-
thod
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998987173913043">
Ponzetto et al. (2007) presented a set of
lightweight heuristics such as head matching
and modifier matching for distinguishing is-a
links from not-is-a links in the Wikipedia cate-
gory network. The main heuristic, “Syntax-
based methods” is based on head matching, in
which a category link is labeled as is-a relation
if the two categories share the same head lem-
ma, such as CAPITALS IN ASIA and CAPI-
TALS. Sakurai et al. (2008) presented a method
equivalent to head matching for Japanese Wi-
kipedia. As Japanese is a head final language,
they introduced the heuristic called suffix
matching; it labels a category link as a is-a rela-
tion if one category is the suffix of the other
category, such as N本CD空港(airports in Ja-
pan) and 空港(airports). In the proposed me-
thod herein, if a Wikipedia category and its
parent category are both person categories, the
category link is labeled as is-a relation. There-
fore, is-a relations, which cannot be extracted
by Ponzetto’s or Sakurai’s method, can be ex-
tracted.

3.2 Kobayashi’s method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916571428571">
Kobayashi et al. (2008) presented a tech-
nique to make a Japanese ontology equivalent
to YAGO; it assigns Goi-Taikei categories to
Japanese Wikipedia categories. These two me-
thods and our method are similar in that a Wi-
kipedia category and the title of an article are
regarded as a category and an instance, respec-
tively. Kobayashi et al. automatically extract
hypernyms from the definition sentence of each
article in advance (referred to hereafter as “D-
hypernym.”) They apply language-dependent
lexico-syntactic patterns to the definition sen-
tence to extract the D-hypernym. Here are some
examples.

where &lt;EOS&gt; refer to the beginning of a
sentence
For example, from the article in Figure 1, the
words “:/L7 -f- (golf player)” is extracted
as the D-hypernym of the article “���/L�
�&apos;j4— (Michelle Wie).”
Figure 3 outlines the Kobayashi’s method.
First, for a Wikipedia category, if its last word
matches an instance of Goi-Taikei category, all
such Goi-Taikei categories are extracted as a
candidate of the Wikipedia category’s super-
class. If the last word of the D-hypernym of the
Wikipedia article listed on the Wikipedia cate-
gory matches an instance of the Goi-Taikei cat-
egory, the Goi-Taikei category is extracted as
the super-class of the Wikipedia category and
its instances (Wikipedia articles) (Figure 3).
Although the Kobayashi’s method is a general
one, it can be used to construct person ontology
if the super-class candidates are restricted to
those Goi-Taikei categories which represent
person.

“ 年 没 (deaths)” and “ 世 紀 没 (th-century

personal names. As far as we know, it is the
only publicly available software to extract a
large number of person names from the Japa-

method, it should be noted that his method
cannot extract person categories.

We extract the WPC by using a machine learn-
ing classifier. If a Wikipedia category and its
parent category are both person categories, the
category link is labeled as an is-a relation. This
means that all is-a relations in our person on-
tology are extracted from the original Wikipe-
dia category hierarchy using only a category
classifier. This is because we investigated
1,000 randomly sampled links between person
categories and found 98.7% of them were is-a
relations. Figure 4 shows an example of the
Wikipedia category hierarchy and the con-
structed WPC hierarchy.

We detect whether the Wikipedia category
label represents a person by using Support Vec-
tor Machine (SVM). The semantic category of
the words in the Wikipedia category label and
those in the neighboring categories are used for
the features. We use the following three aspects
of the texts that exist around the target category
for creating the features:

<listItem confidence="0.9931524">
1. Structural relation between the target cat-

2. Span of the text. (2 kinds)
3. Semantic category of the text derived

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999418">
We examined 48 features by combining the
above three aspects (6*2*4).
The following are the six structural relations
in Wikipedia between the target category and
the text information:
</bodyText>

As for F, for example, when the article ベー
シスト(bassist) is listed on the category: ベ

hypernym of the article as the hypernym of
the category.
As most category labels and D-hypernyms are
common nouns, they are likely to match in-
stances in Goi-Taikei which lists possible se-
mantic categories of words.
5As for D-hypernym extraction patterns, we used almost
the same patterns described in previous works on Japa-
nese sources such as (Kobayashi et al. 2008; Sumida et al.,
2008), which are basically equivalent to the works on
English sources such as (Hearst, 1992).

After the texts located at various structural
relations A-F are collected, they are matched to
the instances of Goi-Taikei in two different
spans:
Span of the text
Ⅰ. All character strings of the text
Ⅱ. The last word of the text
For the span Ⅱ, the text is segmented into
words using a Japanese morphological analyzer.
The last word is used because the last word
usually represents the meaning of the entire
noun phrase (semantic head word) in Japanese.
In the proposed method, hierarchical seman-
tic categories of Goi-Taikei are divided into
two categories; “Goi-Taikei person categories”
and other categories. Goi-Taikei person catego-
ry is defined as those categories that represent
person, that is, all categories under “5:humans”
and “223:officials,” and “1939: occupation”
and “1066:name” in Goi-Taikei hierarchy as
shown in Figure 1.
For each structural relation A-F and span Ⅰ
and Ⅱ, we calculate four relative frequencies
a-d, which represents the manner in which the
span of texts match the instance of Goi-Taikei
person category. It basically indicates the de-
gree to which the span of text is likely to mean
a person.
Semantic type
a. The span of text matches only instances of
Goi-Taikei person categories.
b. The span of text matches only instances of
categories other than Goi-Taikei person cat-
egories.
c. The span of text matches both instances of
Goi-Taikei person categories and those of
other categories.
d. The span of text does not match any in-
stances of Goi-Taikei.
For example, when the target category is “音楽
家” (musicians) in Figure 5 and the feature in
question is B-Ⅱ (the last word of its parent
categories), the word “家” (whose senses are
family and house) falls into semantic type c,
and the word “音楽” (music) falls into seman-
tic type b. Therefore, the frequency of semantic
types a, b, c, d are 0, 1, 1, 0, respectively, in the
features related to B-Ⅱ, and the relative fre-
quencies used for the feature value related B-Ⅱ
are 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0, respectively. In this way, we
use 48 relative frequencies calculated from the
combinations of structural relation A-F, span
Ⅰ and Ⅱ, and semantic type a-d, as the feature
vector for the SVM.

4.2 Similar category
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999928">
In Wikipedia, there are categories that do not
have articles and those with few neighboring
categories. Here, we define the neighboring
categories for a category as those categories
that can be reached through a few links from
the category. In these cases, there is a possibili-
ty that there is not enough text information
from which features (mainly semantic category
of words) can be extracted, which could de-
grade the accuracy.
The proposed method overcomes this prob-
lem by detecting categories similar to the target
category (the category in question) from its
neighboring categories for extracting sufficient
features to perform classification. Here, &amp;quot;simi-
lar category&amp;quot; is defined as parent, child, and
sibling categories whose last word matches the
last word of the target category. This is because
there is a high possibility that the similar cate-
gories and the target category have similar
meaning if they share the same last word in the
category labels. If the parent (child) category is
determined as a similar category, its parent
(child) category is also determined as a similar
category if the last word is the same. The pro-
cedure is repeated as long as they share the
same last word.
Figure 5 shows an example of similar cate-
gories when the target category is “Musicians.”
In this case, features extracted from A-F of

similar categories are added to features ex-

pation” are added to B of “Musicians.”

<bodyText confidence="0.9999198">
We used the XML file of the Japanese Wiki-
pedia as of July 24, 2008. We removed irrele-
vant pages by using keywords (e.g., “image:,”
“Help:”) in advance. This cleaning yielded
477,094 Wikipedia articles and 39,782 Wiki-
pedia categories. We manually annotated each
category to indicate whether it represents per-
son (positive) or not (negative). For ambiguous
cases, we used the following criteria:
*Personal name by itself (e.g., Michael Jack-
son) is not regarded as WPC because usually
it does not have instances. (Note: personal
name as article title is regarded as WPI. )
*Occupational title (e.g., Lawyers) is regarded
as WPC because it represents a person.
*Family (e.g., Brandenburg family) and Eth-
nic group (e.g., Sioux) are regarded as WPC.
*Group name (e.g., The Beatles) is not re-
garded as WPC.
In order to develop a person category classifier,
we randomly selected 2,000 Wikipedia catego-
ries (positive:435, negative:1,565) from all cat-
egories for training6. We used the remaining
37,767 categories for evaluation. To evaluate
WPI extraction accuracy, we used Wikipedia
articles not listed on the Wikipedia categories
used for training. 417,476 Wikipedia articles
were used in the evaluation.
To evaluate our method, we used TinySVM-
0.09 7 with a linear kernel for classification,
and the Japanese morphological analyzer JU-
MAN-6.08 for word segmentation. The com-
parison methods are Kobayashi’s method and
Yamashita’s method under the same conditions

To confirm our assumption on the links be-
tween WPCs, we randomly selected 1,000 pairs
of linked categories from extracted WPCs, and
manually investigated whether both
represented person and were linked by is-a re-
lation. We found that precision of these pairs
was 98.3%.
Errors occurred when the category link be-
tween person categories in the Wikipedia cate-
gory network was not an is-a relation, such as
T�ATc(Chiba clan) – )C,&apos;ARATc(Ohsuga clan).
However, this case is infrequent, because
98.7% of the links between person categories
did exhibit an is-a relation (as described in Sec-
tion 4.1).
Table 2 shows the WPIs extraction accuracy.
We randomly selected 1,000 Wikipedia articles
from all categories in Wikipedia, and manually
created evaluation data (positive:281, nega-
tive:719). The recall of the proposed method
was 98.6%, 21.0 points higher than that of Ya-
mashita’s method. Our method topped the F-
measure of Kobayashi’s method by 3.4 points.
Among 118,552 extracted as WPIs by our me-
thod, 116,418 articles were expected be correct.
In our method, errors occurred when WPI was
not listed on any WPCs. However, this case is
very rare. Person instances are almost always
assigned to at least one WPC. Thus, we can
achieve high coverage for WPIs even if we fo-
cus only on WPCs. We randomly selected
1,000 articles from all articles and obtained 277
person instances by a manual evaluation. Fur-
thermore, we investigated the 277 person in-
stances, and found that only two instances were
not classified into any WPCs (0.7%).

We constructed a WPC hierarchy using the
8,357 categories created by combining ex-
tracted categories and training categories. The
resulting WPC hierarchy has 224 root catego-
ries (Figure 4). Although the majority of the
constructed ontology is interconnected, 194
person categories had no parent or child (2.3 %
of all person categories). In rare cases, the cat-
egory network has loops (e.g., “Historians” and
“Scholars of history” are mutually interlinked).
Shibaki et al. (2009) presented a method for
building a Japanese ontology from Wikipedia
using Goi-Taikei, as its upper ontology. This
method can create a single connected taxono-
my with a single root category. We also hope
to create a large-scale, single-root, and inter-
connected person ontology by using some up-
per ontology.
Our method is able to extract WPCs that do
not match any Goi-Taikei instance (e.g., Vi-
olinists and Animators). Furthermore, our me-
thod is able to detect many ambiguous Wikipe-
dia category labels correctly as person category.
For example, “ファッションモデル (fashion
model)” is ambiguous because the last word
“モデル (model)” is ambiguous among three
senses: person, artificial object, and abstract
relation. Kobayashi’s method cannot extract a
WPC if the last word of the category label does
not match any instance in Goi-Taikei. Their
method is error-prone if the last word has mul-

tiple senses in Goi-Taikei because it is based on
simple pattern matching. Our method can han-
dle unknown and ambiguous category labels
since it uses machine learning-based classifiers
whose features are extracted from neighboring
categories.
Our method can extract is-a person category
pairs that could not be extracted by Ponzetto et
al. (2007) and Sakurai et al. (2008). Their me-
thods use head matching in which a category
link is labeled as an is-a relation only if the
head words of category labels are matched.
However, our method can extract is-a relations
without reference to surface character strings,
such as “✓-r tJ,&gt;I,1 (Journalists)” and
“,&gt;I,-*, &amp;quot;l743 (Sports writers).” Among
all 14,408 Wikipedia category pairs extracted
as is-a relations in our method, 5,558 (38.6%)
did not match their head words.
We investigated the learning curve of the
machine learning-based classifier for extracting
WPCs, in order to decide the appropriate
amount of training data for future updates.
As we have already manually tagged all
39,767 Wikipedia categories, we randomly se-
lected 30,000 categories and investigated the
performance of our method when the number
of the training data was changed from 1,000 to
30,000. The evaluation data was the remaining
9,767 categories.

Figure 6 shows the precision, recall, and F-
measure for different training data sizes. F-
measure differed only 0.4 points from 1,000
samples (98.5%) to 30,000 samples (98.9%).
Figure 6 shows that the proposed method of-
fers high accuracy in detecting WPCs with only
a few thousand training examples.
Our method uses similar categories for
creating features as well as the target Wikipe-
dia category (Section 4.1). We compared the
proposed method to a variant that does not use
similar categories to confirm the effectiveness
of this technique. Furthermore, our method
uses the Japanese thesaurus, Goi-Taikei, to
look up the semantic category of the words for
creating the features for machine learning. We
also compared the proposed method with the
one that does not use semantic category (de-
rived from Goi-Taikei) but instead uses word
surface form for creating features (This one
uses similar categories).
Figure 7 shows the performance of the clas-
sifiers for each type of features. We can clearly
observe that using similar categories results in
higher F-measure, regardless of the training
data size. We also observe that when there is
little training data, the method using word sur-
face form as features results in drastically low-
er F-measures. In addition, its accuracy was
consistently lower than the others even if the
training data size was increased. Therefore, we
can conclude that using similar category and
Goi-Taikei are very important for creating good
features for classification.

We first extract Wikipedia category labels which represent person (hereafter, Wikipedia Person Category, WPC) by using a machine learning classifier. We then construct a WPC hierarchy by dein the Wikipedia category network. We then extract the titles of Wikipedia articles which represent person (hereafter, Wikipedia person instance, WPI). Experiments show that the accuracy of WPC extraction is 99.3% precision and 98.4% recall, while that of WPI extraction is 98.2% and 98.6%, respectively. The accuracies are significantly higher than the previous methods.</abstract>

General ontologies, such as WordNet (Fellbaum et al., 1998), and Nihongo Goi-Taikei (Ikehara et al., 1997), contain general knowledge of wide range of fields. However, it is difficult to instantly add new knowledge, particularly proper nouns, to these general ontologies. Therefore, Wikipedia has come to be used as a useful corpus for knowledge extraction because it is a free and largescale online encyclopedia that continues to be actively developed. For example, in DBpedia (Bizer et al. 2009), RDF triples are extracted from the Infobox templates within Wikipedia articles. In YAGO (Suchanek et al. 2007), an appropriate WordNet synset (most likely category) is assigned to a Wikipedia category as a super-category, and Wikipedia articles are extracted as instances of the category. As a first step to make use of proper noun and related up-to-date information in Wikipedia, we focus on person names and the articles and categories related to them because it contains a large number of articles and categories that indicate person, and because large-scale person ontology is useful for applic</context>

(2007) presented a set of lightweight heuristics such as head matching and modifier matching for distinguishing is-a links from not-is-a links in the Wikipedia category network. The main heuristic, “Syntaxbased methods” is based on head matching, in which a category link is labeled as is-a relation if the two categories share the same head lemma, such as CAPITALS IN ASIA and CAPITALS. Sakurai et al. (2008) presented a method equivalent to head matching for Japanese Wikipedia. As Japanese is a head final language, they introduced the heuristic called suffix matching; it labels a category link as a is-a relation if one category is the suffix of the other category, such as N本CD空港(airports in Japan) and 空港(airports). In the proposed method herein, if a Wikipedia category and its parent category are both person categories, the category link is labeled as is-a relation. Therefore, is-a relations, which cannot be extracted by Ponzetto’s or Sakurai’s method, can be extracted. 3 The Goi-Taikei category </context>

The resulting WPC hierarchy has 224 root categories (Figure 4). Although the majority of the constructed ontology is interconnected, 194 person categories had no parent or child (2.3 % of all person categories). In rare cases, the category network has loops (e.g., “Historians” and “Scholars of history” are mutually interlinked). Shibaki et al. (2009) presented a method for building a Japanese ontology from Wikipedia using Goi-Taikei, as its upper ontology. This method can create a single connected taxonomy with a single root category. We also hope to create a large-scale, single-root, and interconnected person ontology by using some upper ontology. Our method is able to extract WPCs that do not match any Goi-Taikei instance (e.g., Violinists and Animators). Furthermore, our method is able to detect many ambiguous Wikipedia category labels correctly as person category. For example, “ファッションモデル (fashion model)” is ambiguous because the last </context>

General ontologies, such as WordNet (Fellbaum et al., 1998), and Nihongo Goi-Taikei (Ikehara et al., 1997), contain general knowledge of wide range of fields. However, it is difficult to instantly add new knowledge, particularly proper nouns, to these general ontologies. Therefore, Wikipedia has come to be used as a useful corpus for knowledge extraction because it is a free and largescale online encyclopedia that continues to be actively developed. For example, in DBpedia (Bizer et al. 2009), RDF triples are extracted from the Infobox templates within Wikipedia articles. In YAGO (Suchanek et al. 2007), an appropriate WordNet synset (most likely category) is assigned to a Wikipedia category as a super-category, and Wikipedia articles are extracted as instances of the category. As a first step to make use of proper noun and related up-to-date information in Wikipedia, we focus on person names and the articles and categories related to them because it contains a large number of articles and categories that indicate person, and because large-scale person ontology is useful for applications such as person search and named entity recognition. Examples of a person article are personal name and oc</context>

All D-hypernyms extracted from the articles with the same name as the target category. As for F, for example, when the article ベー シスト(bassist) is listed on the category: ベ ー シス ト (bassist), we regard the Dhypernym of the article as the hypernym of the category. As most category labels and D-hypernyms are common nouns, they are likely to match instances in Goi-Taikei which lists possible semantic categories of words. 5As for D-hypernym extraction patterns, we used almost the same patterns described in previous works on Japanese sources such as (Kobayashi et al. 2008; Sumida et al., 2008), which are basically equivalent to the works on English sources such as (Hearst, 1992).
