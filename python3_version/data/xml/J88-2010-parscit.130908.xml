Professor Gunji&apos;s book continues the tradition of explic-
itness in linguistic description so well demonstrated by
Gazdar, Klein, Pullum, and Sag (1985) (GKPS). In
theoretical orientation, too, there is a heavy debt to the
latter. The details, however, show a certain trend
towards the lexicalist position exemplified in theories
such as head-driven phrase-structure grammar (Pollard
and Sag 1987), and categorial unification grammar (Usz-
koreit 1986, Karttunen 1986, Zeevat et al. 1986).
All these theories have been developed with a strong
computational orientation. GKPS could be considered
essential reading for anyone intending or attempting to
develop a serious computational grammar for English,
and Gunji&apos;s Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar
(JPSG) stands in the same relation to Japanese. In fact,
JPSG is used as the basis of the natural-language
component of the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer
project.
The book, a considerably revised version of the
author&apos;s Ohio State M.A. thesis, presents a thorough
and extensive analysis of the central syntactic phenom-
ena of the Japanese language—control in complementa-
tion, reflexive and zero anaphora, unbounded depen-
dencies, and word-order variation.
After a brief introduction, the apparatus to be used in
the analysis is presented. Despite the book&apos;s title, the
phrase-structure rule component is reduced to a single
schematic rule, M —&gt; D H. The burden of constraining
the well-formedness of the local trees licensed by this
rule falls on several principles that govern the distribu-
tion of features in the categories M(other), D(aughter),
and H(ead). These include the head-feature principle
(HFP) and foot-feature principle (FFP), familiar from
GKPS; an adjunct-feature principle, which requires the
value of the ADJUNCT feature of the category D to
unify with the category H; and a SUBCAT feature
principle (SFP), which ensures the satisfaction of lexical
complementation requirements, as in HPSG. SUBCAT
is a feature that takes sets of case-marked categories as
its value, and the SFP states that in complementation,
the value of the mother&apos;s SUBCAT is that of the head
minus the element that unified with the non-head daugh-
ter.
Gunji assumes for most of the book a semantics with
a-reduction of A-calculus expressions as the basic com-
bination operation, and it is this that is explained in the
preliminaries section. However, in the final chapter, on
word order, he suggests that a semantic combination
based on unification is more appropriate for handling a
language with the word-order characteristics of Japa-
nese.
Chapter 3, &amp;quot;Fundamental constructions&amp;quot;, starts with
a detailed argument for the existence of a verb phrase
(VP) in Japanese, and by corollary for the importance of
subject, since VP abbreviates the category
V[SUBCATIPP[SB.M. The rest of the book crucially
exploits the notion of VP. The remainder of Chapter 3
examines the productive processes of causativization,
passivization, and benefactivization. These phenomena
have been the focus of continuing research since Ku-
roda 1965, and have generally been treated by consid-
ering the causative, passive, and benefactive mor-
phemes as verbs taking sentential complements in the
deep structure, with obligatory equi or raising and
predicate raising. In Gunji&apos;s analysis, these morphemes
subcategorize for subject, (possibly dative) object, and
a (crucially) unsaturated verbal constituent. The latter is
either a VP (= V[SUBCAT{PP[SBJ11]), in causatives
and intransitive (adversity) passives, or a TVP (=
V[SUBCATIPP[SBJLPP[OBJ]}]) for the transitive pas-
sive.
Given the unification-based semantics of the final
chapter, the object control is captured simply by iden-
tifying the semantics of the object and the VP or TVP&apos;s
subject in the lexical entries for the bound morphs.
Gunji explicitly declines to give a consistent account of
case marking in simplex sentences and these construc-
tions, thus failing to explain why the causee may not be
marked with accusative case when the embedded verb
is transitive (the latter fact being captured with a feature
co-occurrence restriction.) Neither does he appear to be
worried by the existence of a phrase boundary occur-
ring internally to a word, as in:
Ken ga Naomi ni [vp hon wo yom] ase ta
NOM DAT book ACC read CAUSE PAST
(Ken made Naomi read the book.)
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 77
Book Reviews Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar: A Unification-Based Approach
where the causative yomaseta is clearly a word by the
usual criteria.
Nevertheless, the account of the coreference possi-
bilities of the reflexive zibun made possible by his
analysis is the most convincing to date within a mono-
stratal framework. In a sentence like:
Ken ga [vp Naomi ni [vp zibun no hon wo yom] ase ta]
self GEN
(Ken made Naomi read his (= Ken&apos;s)/her (= Naomi&apos;s)
book.)
the reflexive may be coreferential with the higher sub-
ject or the understood subject of the embedded predi-
cation. Long considered evidence for the biClausal
nature of causative sentences, this ambiguity can be
explained naturally in Gunji&apos;s framework as the possi-
bility of coreference between zibun and the subject on
the SUBCAT list of any dominating VP or TVP,
whether the subject is realized explicitly or controlled
by another element.
Chapter 4 continues the analysis of control, extend-
ing it to cover control of zero pronouns. The latter may
be controlled syntactically, by a constituent with which
they share grammatical function, or pragmatically. In
the former case, the presence of a zero pronoun is
reflected in a nonempty SUBCAT feature on a domi-
nating node. In the latter, an empty lexical element is
freely generated with an appropriate SLASH value. A
general Control Principle then allows a category, such
as an element of the SUBCAT, SLASH, or REFL
feature of a.complement, to be unified with an element
of SUBCAT in the mother. The constituent that finally
unifies with this element by SFP will thus control the
anaphor. The Control Principle applies optionally, so
the mother may in fact inherit SLASH or REFL by the
FFP. Pragmatic control is implicated if such features
have not been discharged at the root of the tree.
Chapter 5 applies the foot-feature apparatus to un-
bounded dependency constructions such as topical-
ization, relativization, and exhaustivization. In the ad-
junction structures that introduce the unbounded
dependency, the FFP allows a foot feature on one of the
daughters to unify with the other daughter. Elsewhere,
the FFP licenses the percolation of SLASH, passing the
dependency through the tree until it terminates at a
category X[SLASH X], the lexical category of the
empty string.
Finally, Chapter 6, though brief, offers two alterna-
tive analyses for the problem of scrambling. The first
exploits the fact that SUBCAT is a set-valued feature,
with no ordering defined over the members. This ap-
proach naturally captures the impossibility of corefer-
ence between subject and reflexive object in object-
subject-verb sentences, since there is no VP dominating
the reflexive. It is not clear, however, that it extends to
the scrambling of constituents in, e.g., causative sen-
tences, since the complements of the lexical and caus-
ative verbs are not members of the same SUBCAT
feature. Though Gunji does not discuss this, he does
point out the inadequacy of the SUBCAT approach for
unbounded scrambling, and proposes an alternative
account based on the use of the SLASH feature for this
phenomenon. Quite justifiably, though, he rejects a
SLASH-based treatment for clause-bounded scram-
bling as unnecessarily complex.
Though the extensive data and detailed argumenta-
tion do not always make for an easy read, Gunji&apos;s style
is fluent and lively. The stories that provide the context
to illustrate sentence meanings are amusing and infor-
mative. There are several sections devoted to the short-
comings of previous transformational approaches,
though the style of Gunji&apos;s analyses are often similar to
them, as he acknowledges, and not as radically lexical-
ist as they might be. Nevertheless, the precision and
coverage of the data exceeds that of all other post-
transformational grammars of Japanese. The details of
JPSG will no doubt be superseded, but it will remain a
yardstick against which Japanese grammars will be
measured for some time to come.
