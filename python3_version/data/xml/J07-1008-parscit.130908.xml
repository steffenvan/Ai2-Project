By “reinterpretation” Egg means to include various phenomena hitherto treated sepa-
rately: metonymy (Amelie labeled the wine, i.e., bottles of wine; All the tenors are on the top
shelf, i.e., CDs of tenors), where either semantic mismatch or contextual implausibility
cause us to do some reasoning in order to arrive at a likely interpretation; examples
of the type enjoy the book discussed in the generative lexicon literature (Pustejovsky
1995); ambiguous adjectival modification of agentives such as beautiful dancer (one who
dances beautifully or a beautiful one who dances); and the various types of coercion
encountered in aspectual composition, where a sentence like John sneezed is taken to
refer to a single event, whereas John sneezed for five minutes is most naturally interpreted
as referring to a sequence of sneezing events.
An important contribution of this book to the literature on aspectual coercion is
a distinction between two kinds of reinterpretation. The first kind is like the sneezing
example where the reinterpretation can be succinctly described formally via the inter-
position of a type-shifting operator between the temporal modifier and the whole global
event complex. The second kind is what Egg calls “landing site” coercion, where some
internal component of the verbal event complex is augmented and made the object of
the temporal modifier; for example, Joe hired a car for a week, where for a week describes
the duration of the result of the hiring event rather than the hiring event itself. The two
types of coercion, Egg points out, can differ in their entailment properties. Amelie played
the sonata, in a neutral context, entails that she completed it. Amelie played the sonata for an
hour can have either an iterative or a progressive reading. On the progressive reading,
famously, it is not entailed that Amelie played (i.e., completed) the sonata. However,
in an example of “landing site” coercion like Amelie left for an hour the entailment that
Amelie left is preserved. Notice that on the iterative reading of the sonata example,
however, the perfective entailment that Amelie completed the sonata (at least once,
possibly several times) is preserved: The diagnostic is only conclusive for cases like the
progressive coercion.
The structure of the book is as follows. Chapter 1 is a survey of previous work
in all types of aspectual, nominal, and verbal coercion. Egg’s discussion is fair and
sympathetic, though not uncritical; he argues, correctly in my view, that Pustejovsky’s
(1995) account of coercions like begin the book draws the line between linguistic and non-
linguistic knowledge in the wrong place.
Chapter 2 describes Egg’s chosen formalism for representing meanings: The Con-
straint Language for Lambda Structures, one of a family of representation languages
designed to be able to capture underspecification. Although the details are too complex
Computational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 1
to be included here, the basic idea is that lambda terms are represented in a directed
graph notation, where nodes represent constants, variables, and operators, and edges
represent structural relations such as dominance. Underspecified meaning representa-
tions are incomplete graphs, typically lacking one or more edges, but capable of being
monotonically augmented to represent specific (sets of) meanings. For example, differ-
ent resolutions of scope ambiguities can be represented by adding different dominance
constraints between terms representing quantifiers. Egg’s treatment of the range of
reinterpretation phenomena that are discussed essentially extends this mechanism by
allowing various extra-linguistic constraints to fill in for missing edges, their effect being
to allow a connection between nodes that would otherwise be incompatible through
type or sortal or contextual mismatches.
Chapters 3 and 4 are a detailed account of the mechanics of this process for most of
the phenomena introduced and described informally in the earlier chapters. Getting a
reasonably complete analysis of any linguistic phenomenon necessitates a few assump-
tions that are perhaps arguable, and these chapters are no exception, but the account
given is detailed and clear enough that it would be perfectly possible to incorporate
the main features in an actual implementation (with the usual caveats about the limited
coverage of hand-crafted fragments), which is a good deal more than can be said for
most published linguistic analyses.
In Chapter 5, Egg embarks on a preliminary sketch of a piece of “commonsense
metaphysics.” It is clear that one of the primary factors involved in aspectual coercion
is a mismatch between temporal durations: We interpret Joe sneezed for five minutes as
iterative because we know that the typical temporal duration of a sneeze is less than five
minutes. Egg develops the beginnings of an account of the role of temporal duration in
reinterpretation, arguing that predicates are associated with their typical durations, not
in the lexicon, but as part of our knowledge of the world. Egg represents durations as
sets of “temporal granularities” such as {minutes}, {hours}, and {0.1 sec}. Mismatch
of durations corresponds to empty intersections of these granularities. Egg develops
enough of a mechanism for it to be clear how this information could be integrated into
his previous account of reinterpretation.
Egg also argues that the availability of an account of temporal duration eliminates
the need for a separate aspectual category of punctuality, or the “point” class that
Moens and Steedman (1988) added to Vendler’s original taxonomy. If we can account
for the coercion in Joe sneezed for five minutes simply in terms of duration mismatch, we
do not need to talk about coercion of a point category into something else. I am less
convinced of this in the general case, however. Several accounts of multiple aspectual
coercion, such as that exemplified in Moens and Steedman’s splendid example It took
me two days to play the “Minute Waltz” in less than sixty seconds for more than an hour
require a complex eventuality “play the Minute Waltz in less than sixty seconds” to be
coerced to a point, and then that point to be coerced to an iteration “for more than an
hour.” It is implausible to assume that non-lexical predicates like this have a prior non-
linguistic association with characteristic temporal durations, and this would in any case
suggest a different interpretation for such an example. In these cases at least, a punctual
category of “point,” in which any internal temporal structure is ignored, does seem to
be required.
I enjoyed reading this book, and not just because it agreed with many of my own
prejudices. It is clearly written, consistently fair-minded and interesting, and the analy-
ses are detailed enough to be convincing. For those who, like me, still hope that one
day the kind of fine-grained semantic analysis illustrated in this book will be capable of
implementation on a large scale, there is much of value here.
