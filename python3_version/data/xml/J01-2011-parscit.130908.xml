Talmy is a pioneer of cognitive linguistics and something of an icon. His most impor-
tant papers from 1972 to 1999 are re-presented here organized in terms of their subject
matter. All papers have been revised, and most expanded. However, they are not par-
ticularly well integrated in this massive work, which combines patches of brilliance
with unnecessary wordiness and repetition—it needed a stern editor.&apos; Volume I, con-
sisting of an introduction and eight chapters, is &amp;quot;concerned with the patterns in which
and the processes by which conceptual content is organized in language&amp;quot; (1.2). Vol-
ume II, consisting of the identical introduction and (a different) eight chapters, presents
typologies for the structure of concepts, proceeding to on-line processing of these in
culture and narrative. Talmy&apos;s viewpoint is that &amp;quot;the relation between a linguistic ex-
pression and something in the world cannot be direct but must, in effect &apos;pass through&apos;
the mind of the language user&amp;quot; (1.309, n. 14). Cognitive systems—language, percep-
tion, reasoning, affect, attention, memory, cultural structure, and motor control—share
some fundamental properties as well as each having unique structural properties; they
are not autonomous like Fodor modules (I.16). &amp;quot;Semantics simply pertains to concep-
tual content as it is organized in language&amp;quot; (1.4). Conceptual content includes affect
and perception—only accessible through introspection, which must be employed with
&amp;quot;controlled manipulation of linguistic material&amp;quot; (I.5)—that is, correlation with other
findings across languages and other sciences. Talmy pays closer attention to meaning-
form mappings than do many writers on semantics. He is best known for bringing
the notions of Figure and Ground—a schematic system of attention—into linguistics
in the early 1970s. &amp;quot;In Figure-Ground organization, the entity that functions as the
Figure of a situation attracts focal attention and is the entity whose characteristics and
fate are of concern. The Ground entity is in the periphery of attention and functions
as a reference entity used to characterize the Figural properties of concern&amp;quot; (1.12-13).
It is within this framework that the book is written.

1 There are inconsistencies; for example, there is no explanation when it is first mentioned of Atsugewi&apos;s
affiliation (it is a Hokan language of Northern California). Abbreviations are only occasionally
explained. There are many minor typos. Also, I disagree with many of Talmy&apos;s grammaticality
judgments—which would lead me to different analyses of a small portion of his material.

Chapter 1.1, on the relation of grammar to cognition, covers many topics in a
fairly shallow manner. Some of them could have been written up in more extensive
studies as separate chapters. Talmy&apos;s general point is that grammar is &amp;quot;the determinant
of conceptual structure&amp;quot; (1.22). Closed-class grammatical forms structure conception
(which sounds Whorfian); open-class lexical forms contain content. Talmy identifies
four lexical classes: ideophones, nouns, verbs, adjectives (in the two volumes he says
nothing further about ideophones and rarely mentions adjectives). Controversially,
he claims that all adverbs are derived (1.23)—for example, I dried the cups carefully
derives from I was careful in drying the cups (1.393). Interestingly, Talmy applies cognitive
categories that have traditionally been restricted to either noun or verb to both lexical
categories; for example, countability is usually limited to nominals but, using the terms
&amp;quot;uniplex&amp;quot; (singular) and &amp;quot;multiplex&amp;quot; (mass and plural), he applies them to verbs (1.49-
50). He correlates count with punctual aspect, collective with iterative aspect, mass
with durative aspect (1.95, n. 12).
On a theme that recurs throughout the work, Talmy compares static and motile
perspectives (1.68):

(2) There is a house every now and then through the valley.

<bodyText confidence="0.9003968">
Chapter 1.2 is on fictive motion and &amp;quot;ception&amp;quot;—the latter a useful neologism su-
perordinate to both conception and perception. Fictive motion is demonstrated by the
motion perceived &amp;quot;in successive flashes along a row of lightbulbs as on a marquee&amp;quot;
(1.99) and in (3), where the fence has fictive motion and factive stationariness, and (4)
where the scenery does so.

<bodyText confidence="0.99928025">
Fictive motion with factive stationariness is more common than the reverse (e.g., The
students get younger every year), reflecting a cognitive bias toward dynamism. This seems
to be at odds with a later claim that &amp;quot;stationariness is basic for an observer&amp;quot; (1.133),
manifest in the pre-Renaissance belief that the heavens move around Earth and (5)–(6).

Chapter 1.3 is on how languages structure space. Talmy&apos;s pioneering work has
inspired many others and a lot has been written on this topic since the 1970s. Talmy&apos;s
notions of Figure and Ground have been widely adopted.
The Figure is a moving or conceptually movable entity whose site,
path, or orientation is conceived as variable the particular value of
which is the relevant issue.
The Ground is a reference entity, one that has a stationary setting
relative to a reference frame, with respect to which the Figure&apos;s site,
path, or orientation is characterized. (1.184)

Figure properly includes the participant role of &amp;quot;theme,&amp;quot; extending the idea to clauses
within complex sentences that do not clearly hold a participant role within a clause
structure. To anyone familiar with the relevant literature, there is little new in this
chapter, which presents a detailed and formal account of motion and stasis in space and
time. The appendix (1.245-252) offers the most succinct account to be found anywhere.
Chapter 1.4 examines the windowing of attention—that is, placing &amp;quot;a portion of a
coherent referent situation [event frame] into the foreground of attention by explicit
mention&amp;quot; (1.257). The rest is &amp;quot;gapped&amp;quot; (backgrounded). An event frame is demarcated
by a boundary enclosing a region of coherence, corelevance, and connectivity They
include paths, causal chains, cycles, participant interactions and interrelationships such
as Figure-Ground, factual-counterfactual. Different types of complement occur within
the event frame: obligatory, optional, and blocked. Outside the event frame are optional
adjuncts (1.263); for example:

There is an excellent analysis of causation (1.272). Cross-linguistically, bodily actions
and the means of causing can readily be omitted; for example, I broke the window
(1.279). As Talmy says in another context &amp;quot;Linguistic structures, in effect, &apos;chunk&apos; the
complexities and continuities of occurrence into this simplified schema&amp;quot; (1.457).
I have grave doubts about Talmy&apos;s account of counterfactuals (which courageously
ignores most of the literature). One reason for doubt is found on page 1.293, where
Talmy glosses A(not-P) as &amp;quot;What actually happened [-= A] is that [not-P] it is not the
case that I went to the party&amp;quot; which he says is &amp;quot;equivalent to — A(P)&amp;quot;. But — A(P) is
identical with not so Talmy is claiming, in effect, &amp;quot;What actually happened is that
it is not the case that I went to the party&amp;quot; is true only if &amp;quot;What didn&apos;t actually happen
is that I went to the party&amp;quot;. If we reinterpret this as (A not-P) (not-A P), it
is false. However, if we read Talmy&apos;s &amp;quot;— A(P)&amp;quot; as not-(A --÷ P), then it is true that

I went to the party&amp;quot; entails &amp;quot;What actually happened is that it is not the case that I
went to the party&amp;quot; (but not vice versa).
Chapter 1.5 is on Figure and Ground, and there is not a lot new here. The stan-
dard examples such as (14) being preferred over (15) are found together with more
interesting constraints such as that on while in (17).

There is a very interesting semantics for prepositions and coordinating conjunctions in
the following Chapter 1.6 (1.351-352). This chapter reviews many structures and lexical
forms that relate Figure to Ground events. On the model of (14), Talmy generates many
semi-acceptable nominalizations such as (18), which presumably means (19) (1.349).
Can&apos;t Figure-Ground relations be handled any other way?

Talmy identifies what he calls &amp;quot;copy-cleft sentences&amp;quot; (see discussion 1.370-377), itali-

anyway.
(20) They were feeling tired; (but) they went out {
despite that.
Copy-clefts are sort of proforms; for example, that in (20) can be expanded to the fact
that they were feeling tired. In a copy-cleft, the Figure always comes second. Example (21)
is a complex sentence and (22) is its copy-cleft counterpart.
(21) They stayed at home [F] because they were feeling tired [G].
(22) They were feeling tired [G], so they stayed at home [F].
It is suggested that the copy-clefts may be easier to process (1.382-383). Talmy claims
that &amp;quot;languages appear to fall into two typological categories on the basis of whether
they have or lack conjunctional copy-cleft structure&amp;quot; (1.404), but this is not demon-
strated for more than a small handful of languages.
Talmy identifies an &amp;quot;Inclusion principle&amp;quot; (1.379).
The unmarked (or only possible) linguistic expression for a relation
of temporal inclusion between two events treats the larger, containing
event as Ground and the smaller, contained event as Figure. Where
the complete syntactic form is a full complex sentence, the two events
are in the subordinate and the main clause, respectively.
Similarly in a causative: the causing event is Ground and the result is Figure.

Chapter 1.7 is on force dynamics, &amp;quot;one of the pre-eminent conceptual organizing
categories in language&amp;quot; (1.461). &amp;quot;Force dynamics covers the range of relations that one
entity can bear to another with respect to force&amp;quot; (I.10). Force dynamic verbs include
make, get, stop, let, keep, help, refrain from, exert oneself to, try to, manage to, fail to, resist, yield
to, withstand, urge, persuade, refuse (1.425-440). The focal force entity is &apos;Agonist&amp;quot;, the
entity opposing it &amp;quot;Antagonist&amp;quot; (1.413); see Table 1.
There are some problems with Talmy&apos;s discussion of modals. For instance, he
wrongly equates root modal with deontic modal (1.443). The root meaning of can,
for example in I can speak Swahili is cognate with Scots ken, know, canny, cunning. The
deontic meaning has to do with permission—cf. Yes, you can go to the movie if you&apos;re back
home by midnight.
Chapter 1.8 examines the semantics of causation, analyzing increasingly complex
causatives. Talmy proposes an underlying syntactic structure in which semantic com-
ponents and their interrelations are explicitly indicated, and these are systematically
correlated with surface forms. This very comprehensive account of causatives should
be read by everyone working on them. It is one of the best chapters in the book.
Turning to Volume II, Chapter 11.1 is on lexicalization patterns—systematic rela-
tions between meaning and form. It looks at semantic components, their various modes
of combination, and the effects of their different locations in surface sentences. The
chapter begins by examining semantic categories lexicalized in the verb root; for exam-
ple, there is a conflation of MOVE and manner in English slide, roll, bounce, swing, creak,
rush, twist; a conflation of MOVE and cause in blow, pull, boil, kick, flick, chop, saw (11.28).
Motion is characteristic of Figure; Ground rarely if ever gets conflated. Talmy makes a
detailed semantics of motion and to a lesser extent location verbs in English, Spanish,
Atsugewi, and a few other languages. There is a survey of how different languages
handle being in a position, getting into a position, and putting into a position (11.78-84).
What others call &amp;quot;semantic primitives&amp;quot; Talmy calls &amp;quot;deep morphemes&amp;quot; (11.37):
A deep morpheme represents a concept that is believed to be both fun-
damental and universal in the semantic organization of language. A
mid-level morpheme represents a particular conceptual complex that
consists of a deep morphemic concept together with certain additional
semantic material.
Chapter 11.2, which surveys lexicalization patterns, is an appendix to the previous
chapter. Except for Section 4 on Atsugewi cause satellites and polysynthetic verbs, most
of the content is to be found elsewhere in these two volumes. (&amp;quot;Satellites&amp;quot; are manifest
by verb particles in English, affixes in many languages, verb complements in Chinese.
Talmy classifies many verbal classifiers, for example, in Atsugewi, as satellites.)

Chapter 11.3 gives a typology of event integration. A &amp;quot;macro-event,&amp;quot; an event
complex, is &amp;quot;fundamental and pervasive .. . amenable to conceptualization as a single
fused event&amp;quot; expressed by a single clause (11.213). For example, I broke the window may
be the chunked version of I took up a stone and threw it and it broke the window—as remarked
earlier. Five macro-event types are these (contrast the verb particle/adverbial): Motion:
The ball rolled in. Change of state: The candle blew out. Temporal contouring: They talked
on. She stopped talking. Action correlating: She sang along. Realization: The fugitive was
hunted down. (11.214)
In &amp;quot;verb-framed languages&amp;quot; (e.g., Romance, Japanese, Bantu, Mayan), the activat-
ing process and core schema is in the verb; the support event is in an adjunct (the
satellite): for example, Spanish La botella salio flotando [the bottle exited floating]. In
&amp;quot;satellite-framed languages&amp;quot; (e.g., English, Chinese, Ojibwa, Warlpiri), the activating
process and supporting event are in the verb; the core schema is in the satellite and/or
preposition; for example, The bottle floated out (11.223).
Chapter 11.4, &amp;quot;Borrowing semantic space: diachronic hybridization,&amp;quot; identifies Slav-
ic semantic influence on Yiddish, then generalizes to semantic borrowing across lan-
guages without sufficient ground for doing so (11.316-318). For instance, Talmy sug-
gests that no language will lose distinctions under influence of a language that does
not have them; but this isn&apos;t always true for classifier systems in the world&apos;s languages.
The chapter has a somewhat out-of-place but nonetheless interesting list of differences
in semantic organization between English and Atsugewi (11.294). Yiddish took over
morphemes from Slavic using Germanic morphs. For example, &amp;quot;Russian na- expresses
not only &apos;accumulate by Ving&apos; but also &apos;fill by Ving&apos; and, with the reflexive, &apos;V to
one&apos;s full capacity&apos;. And Yiddish on- has the same three meanings&amp;quot; (11.299). It turns
out that Yiddish on-, derived from German an-, is not synonymous with Russian na-,
but overlaps it in meaning. Clearly Yiddish on-, and other morphs and morphemes,
have developed independent meanings over time (11.304). In relevant contexts, Yid-
dish has an obligatory perfective aspect prefix, just as Russian does. However no
Slavic suffixes were adopted (11.312). Here follows a completely empty statement: &amp;quot;A
structure in another language can be incommensurate enough to a potential borrower
that neither the structure nor sometimes even the meanings expressed by it will be
acceptable&amp;quot; (11.313). It doesn&apos;t explain or predict anything further than that a structure
in the donor language has not been borrowed!
Chapter 11.5 is 14 pages on semantic conflict and resolution. What little it contains
that is new should have been included in Chapters 1.1 or 1.2.
Chapter 11.6 is on how to correlate possibly conflicting communicative goals with
the available means of expression (11.337). Talmy recognizes that communication often
has interpersonal as well as ideational purposes, but he fails to mention the work
of Halliday or Grice and their followers. He is unusual in recognizing in a schol-
arly work that individuals vary in their ability to communicate (11.342). The excellent
list of communicative goals (11.343-344) is unfortunately discussed without additional
insight.
Chapter 11.7, &amp;quot;The cognitive culture system,&amp;quot; is on what is universal, what is in-
dividual, and what is innate in the expression of culture. Talmy&apos;s main point is that
&amp;quot;culture is a highly organized cognitive construction&amp;quot; (11.374). Unfortunately he only
elaborates on the blindingly obvious: culture is acquired from those around us during
our early years (cultural development parallels language development) (11.377); we ex-
ercise cultural practices in our communities; and we pass on culture to the young. He
lists (from Murdock [1965]) 72 universal categories of culture (e.g., age-grading, sex-
ual restrictions, [11.376]), which seem acceptable. Animals, even nonhuman primates,
brought up with humans never adopt human culture—which seems to indicate an in-

nate predisposition on our part. Talmy recognizes that an individual may react against
his or her culture, but not that this is always in a very limited sphere. He emphasizes
the individual variations that lead to cultural change, but doesn&apos;t make enough of
the chicken-and-egg nature of culture: an individual is a product of their cultural
environment as well as a contributor to its development.
Chapter 11.8 presents a cognitive account of narrative structure. &amp;quot;Th[e] narrative
cognitive system would generally function to connect and integrate certain compo-
nents of conscious content over time into a coherent ideational structure&amp;quot; (11.419).
There is nothing new in this chapter. The content might offer a useful review of narra-
tive or discourse structure for a complete neophyte; but the language Talmy employs
would exclude many a young undergraduate. It is a disappointing end to the book.
Toward a Cognitive Semantics makes a useful reference work. It was a good idea
to collect 30 years&apos; work together, but the items of real value could probably have
been pared down to fill a single volume. One general criticism is that Talmy often
makes universalist claims for cognitive patterns and processes in language with very
little cross-linguistic exemplification or support. But this, I suppose, leaves research
for others to do.
