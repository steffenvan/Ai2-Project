We demonstrate a text to sign language
translation system for investigating sign
language (SL) structure and assisting in
production of sign narratives and informa-
tive presentations1. The system is demon-
strable on a conventional PC laptop com-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999049">
During the last half century sign languages have
been recognized as genuine languages. Thus sign
languages are now accepted as minority languages,
which coexist with majority languages (Neidle et
al., 2000) and which are the native languages for
many deaf people. Provision of information ac-
cess and services in signed languages is as impor-
tant as in other minority languages. Such provision,
however, introduces theoretical and technical chal-
lenges. The use of a sign language gesture nota-
tion to drive virtual humans (avatars) for present-
ing signing has been investigated (Kennaway, 2001).
Semi-automatic translation system from individual
English sentences to such a sign language gesture
notation has been demonstrated (self identifyinh ref-
erences). Here, extension of this system to handle
location of nominals at positions in the three dimen-
sional space in front of the signer and noun verb
agreement involving such allocated positions is de-
scribed and illustrated.

2 Sign language phenomena
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927176470588">
Sign Languages (SLs) involve simultaneous manual
and non-manual components for conveying mean-
ing. Non-manual features are comprised of the pos-
ture of the upper torso, the orientation of the head
and facial expressions. Manual features have been
often been decomposed as hand-shape, hand orienta-
tion, hand position and motion (Stokoe,1978; Brien,
1992; Sutton-Spence and Woll, 1999). The Ham-
burg Notation System (HamNoSys) (Prillwitz et al.,
1989; Hanke and Schmaling, 2001; Hanke, 2002)
is an established phonetic transcription system for
SLs comprising more than 200 iconically motivated
symbols to describe these manual and non-manual
features of signs.
The manual components of signs are constrained
to occur within signing space. Signing space is the
three-dimensional space in front of the signer which
extends vertically from above the signer’s head to
waist level, and horizontally from touching/close to
the body to at arm’s length in front of and to the
side of the signer. Signs can be categorised in terms
of the ways they use signing space. Body anchored
and fixed nominal and verbal signs are either signed
at a fixed body location or involve internal motion
which allow relatively little modification to the sign.
In contrast, some nominal signs can be signed at
varying locations and thus the location where they
are signed has significance. Furthermore, directional
verbs allow grammatical and semantic information
to be encoded within signing space such that the spe-
cific start and/or end positions of these signs have
syntactic and semantic significance (Liddel, 1990).
A further distinction can be made between topo-
graphic and syntactic use of space (Klima and Bel-

lugi, 1979; Emmorey et al., 1995; Sutton-Spence
and Woll, 1999). In the case of the former, signing
space is used to gesture towards and point at objects
and persons physically present and thus has similar-
ities with body anchored signs where the location at
which a sign is made has an iconic/deictic function.
However, in cases where the signer describes rela-
tionships between objects and persons which are not
present, position within signing space can be used
to denote abstract referents. Similarities between to-
pographic and syntactic uses are apparent and of-
ten there is overlap between the two, and there is
some evidence to suggest that, contrary to expecta-
tions, the granularity of the two may be comparable
(Cormier, 2002). As our concerns are with transla-
tion from English text to sign language (and hence
physical presence is not an issue) we concentrate on
the syntactic uses of signing space.

The architecture of the English text to British Sign
Langauge (BSL) system is essentially a pipeline of
four main translation stages

3.1 Syntactic Parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775142857143">
English text (Figure 2 top left) is parsed by the
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) link grammar
parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1991) to produce
an appropriate linkage which characterises syntactic
dependencies (Figure 2 bottom left). In cases where
multiple linkages are generated, the user intervenes
to select an appropriate linkage.

3.2 DRS Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948083333333">
From a CMU parser generated linkage a Discourse
Representation Structure DRS (Kamp and Reyle,
1993) is generated to capture the semantic content
of the text (Figure 2 top middle). DRSs allow iso-
lation of specific semantic content (nominal, verbal
and adjectival based predicates, discourse referents
and temporal relationships). Anaphora resolution is
used to associate pronouns with discourse referents,
and reuse of nouns is used to imply co-reference
to the same linguistic referent. Currently, the most
common 50% CMU links are transformed into DRS
form.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999627">
3.3 Semantic Transfer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998551692307692">
An English oriented DRS is transformed into a SL
oriented DRS. In particular, the number of argu-
ments for some predicates is modified to a different
number of arguments expected of a corresponding
SL sign. For example, the English verb move obli-
gatorily requires only one argument but is often ac-
companied by optional adjuncts for the source and
destination locations. Its BSL equivalent (glossed
as MOVE) requires three arguments - the start and
end sign space positions and a (classifier or default)
handshape consistent with the object being moved.
Such transformations are effected on the DRS.
The DRS is then transformed to an equivalent

3.4 HamNoSys SL Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99818965">
A SL grammar and lexicon are used to drive deriva-
tion of a HamNoSys phonetic description of a sign
sequence from the HPSG semantic structure (Fig-
ure 2 bottom middle). The BSL lexicon contains ap-
proximately 250 lexical items. Some lexical items
are fully instantiated forms for fixed and body-
anchored signs, however others are only partially in-
stantiated forms for directional verbs and forms of
modulation of lexical items. For nominal oriented
signs, classifiers are associated with signs, and for
directional verbs the lexical entries require incorpo-
ration of specific forms of classifiers and sign space
locations.
The SL grammar constitutes a collection of simul-
taneous constraints which the phonology and syntax
of selected signs must satisfy in order to constitute
a valid sign sequence. These constraints enforce ap-
propriate sign order, for example realising a topic
comment ordering signs for the English sentence ” I
saw an exciting video.”

<sectionHeader confidence="0.915095" genericHeader="method">
VIDEO EXCITING/INTERESTING SEE ME
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943038461538">
Sign space location agreement requires that nom-
inals are assigned consistent positions in signing
space and that directional verbs agree with these
positions that reflects anaphoric relationships of the
original text and use with directional verbs. In this
example, the directional verb SEE must start at the
location of ME and be directed towards the location
of VIDEO. Subsequent references to the same ob-
ject must respect its position by signing the sign at
the same location or by anaphoric pointing at that
location. This form of agreement is achieved by in-
clusion of a model of signing space within the HPSG
feature structure in which nominals are allocated po-
sitions and from which verbal signs acquire posi-
tional information (Figure 2 top right).
Number agreement between nominal and verbal
signs is enforced distinguishing between collective
and distributive interpretations of plurals. For ex-
ample, the friends in ”I invited four friends” may
have been invited individually (in which case the di-
rectional verb INVITE is repeated three times) or
they may have been invited as a group (with IN-
VITE signed only once). The under-specification in
the English input is resolved by requesting the user
to volunteer the additional information of a distribu-
tive or collective reading.

Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999978266666667">
The resulting HamNoSys sign sequence descriptions
are realised visually as virtual human behaviour
(Kennaway, 2001) (Figure 2 bottom right) 2. Cur-
rently, the SL generation sub-system incorporates a
lexicon and grammar whose coverage are represen-
tative of a number of interesting SL phenomena and
whose semantic, syntactic and phonological formal-
isation is one of the most advanced SL characteri-
sations available. Such detail is essential to enable
visualisation by a virtual human. The main omis-
sion in the system currently is the absence of non-
manual components of signing, though the SL gen-
eration has been designed to be extended in this di-
rection in the future. The functionality of the system
is demonstrable on a laptop computer.

For example, the friends in ”I invited four friends” may have been invited individually (in which case the directional verb INVITE is repeated three times) or they may have been invited as a group (with INVITE signed only once). The under-specification in the English input is resolved by requesting the user to volunteer the additional information of a distributive or collective reading. Conclusions The resulting HamNoSys sign sequence descriptions are realised visually as virtual human behaviour (Kennaway, 2001) (Figure 2 bottom right) 2. Currently, the SL generation sub-system incorporates a lexicon and grammar whose coverage are representative of a number of interesting SL phenomena and whose semantic, syntactic and phonological formalisation is one of the most advanced SL characterisations available. Such detail is essential to enable visualisation by a virtual human. The main omission in the system currently is the absence of nonmanual components of signing, though the SL generation has been designed to be extended in this direction in the future. The functionality of the system is demonstrable o</context>

Body anchored and fixed nominal and verbal signs are either signed at a fixed body location or involve internal motion which allow relatively little modification to the sign. In contrast, some nominal signs can be signed at varying locations and thus the location where they are signed has significance. Furthermore, directional verbs allow grammatical and semantic information to be encoded within signing space such that the specific start and/or end positions of these signs have syntactic and semantic significance (Liddel, 1990).

The system is demonstrable on a conventional PC laptop computer. 1 Introduction During the last half century sign languages have been recognized as genuine languages. Thus sign languages are now accepted as minority languages, which coexist with majority languages (Neidle et al., 2000) and which are the native languages for many deaf people. Provision of information access and services in signed languages is as important as in other minority languages. Such provision, however, introduces theoretical and technical challenges.

English syntactic parsing, 2. Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) generation, 3. Semantic transfer, 4. Generation of HamNoSys SL phonetic descriptions, as illustrated in Figure 1. 3.1 Syntactic Parsing English text (Figure 2 top left) is parsed by the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) link grammar parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1991) to produce an appropriate linkage which characterises syntactic dependencies (Figure 2 bottom left). In cases where multiple linkages are generated, the user intervenes to select an appropriate linkage. 3.2 DRS Generation From a CMU parser generated linkage a Discourse Representation Structure DRS (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) is generated to capture the semantic content of the text (Figure 2 top middle). DRSs allow isolation of specific semantic content (nominal, verbal and adjectival based predicates, discourse referents and temporal relationships).
