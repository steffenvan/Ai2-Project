Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are paid. Membership
includes a full year of the A CL joumal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most A CL-sponsored conferences, and discounts
on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for renewals received after! April; this fee does not apply to new
members. Institutions subscribe to the journal through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; +1-617-253-
2889 phone; 258-6779 fax; journals-orders@mit.edu email. Back issues and proceedings are available only from the ACL, except that
institutions should backorder journals for 1988 and following years through MIT Press. Payments for dues, back issues, and proceedings
can be made in Europe and Japan as well as the U.S. Read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify
institutional affiliation, ifit is not part of your address. Also provide telephone country &amp; region codes and e-mail address, even if you have

Enter Total Amount at end of address field.
Prepayment is necessary; invoices are available on request. The U.S. dollar price is definitive when paying in other currencies, although
rounding off is appropriate. Checks and money orders should be made out to the Association for Computation Linguistics (or to ACL). ALL
CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS MUST BE MADE TO THE ACL OFFICE IN THE USA; ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS ARE
PREFERRED; send the information above from Name through Total Payment, with an identification of the items for which payment is
being made, to acl@bellcore.com; or request a form by email. Other payments can be made to one of the addresses below, as follows:

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95031275">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.756994">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9957405">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been
formed; others are likely to be added.
