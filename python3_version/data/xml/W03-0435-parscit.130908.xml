We used the memory-based learner Timbl
(Daelemans et al., 2002) to find names in En-
glish and German newspaper text. A first sys-
tem used only the training data, and a number
of gazetteers. The results show that gazetteers
are not beneficial in the English case, while
they are for the German data. Type-token gen-
eralization was applied, but also reduced per-
formance. The second system used gazetteers
derived from the unannotated corpus, as well as
the ratio of capitalized versus uncapitalized use
of each word. These strategies gave an increase
in performance.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997495">
This paper describes a memory-based approach to learn-
ing names in English and German newspaper text.
The first system used no unannotated data - only the
provided training material, and a number of gazetteers.
It was shown that the gazetteers made for a better per-
formance in the German task, but not in the English task.
Type-token generalization was helpful for neither English
nor German.
The second system used unannotated data, but only for
the English task. The extra data were used in two ways:
first, more gazetteers were derived from the corpus by
exploiting conjunctions: if in a conjunction of capitalized
strings one string is recognized as being a certain type
of name, the other strings are assumed to be of the same
type and stored in a new gazetteer. This list was then used
to construct an additional feature for training the machine
learning algorithm. The second approach counts how of-
ten each word form in the additional corpus is capitalized,
and how often it is not. This is used as another feature for
the learning algorithm.

2 Memory Based Learning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938722222222">
We used Timbl (Daelemans et al., 2002), a memory-
based learner. When presented with training instances,
the learner stores them all, and then classifies new data
on the basis of its k nearest neighbours in the training set.
Before classification, the learner assigns weights to each
of the features, marking their importance for the learning
task. Features with higher weights are treated as more
important in classification as those with lower weights.
Timbl has some parameters which can be adjusted in
order to improve learning. For the NER system described
in this paper, we varied the parameters k and m. k is the
number of nearest neighbours Timbl looks at. m deter-
mines the feature metrics, i.e. the importance weights
given to each feature, and the way similarity between
values of the same feature is computed. This parame-
ter can be adjusted separately for each feature. The two
metrics used were weighted overlap and modified value
difference.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.926708">
3.1 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999781736842105">
For the basic English system, 37 features were used. The
first seven features were the lowercase versions of the fo-
cus word, and a context of three words to the left and the
right. The next seven features were the part-of-speech
tags of the same seven words. Then followed seven fea-
tures indicating for each of the seven words if they were
capitalized or not. The next six features represented the
first and last three letters of the word to be classified.
These features were included in order to make it possible
for the memory-based learner to use word-internal infor-
mation. Frequent prefixes and suffixes can thus be used
to learn names. Finally, ten features indicated if the focus
word appears in any of the gazetteers used for this task.
These gazetteers are discussed in more detail in the next
section.
For the German system, the same features were used,
with an additional seven features: for each word in the
seven-word window, the stem of the word was also in-
cluded.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995807">
3.2 Gazetteers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998275">
Ten gazetteers were used to provide features. These
gazetteers listed names of all four kinds, as well as words
which often appear inside names (such as International
(for organization names) and de (for person names)).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997876">
3.3 Type – token generalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908333333333">
A module was created to generalize NE tags from types
to tokens. It is a simple program which assumes that if
two capitalized words have the same form, they will also
have the same NE tag. This is potentially problematic,
because many words can be used either as part of a name
or not, and in this case it indeed proved to be unhelpful.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.985202" genericHeader="method">
4 System 2: Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999763666666666">
For the extended English system, four more features were
added to each instance: the first four indicated if the focus
word was part of a named entity found in a list of named
entities derived from the unannotated data. The second
new feature indicated if the focusword is capitalized or
uncapitalized most often in the unannotated data.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997555">
4.1 Gazetteers extracted from conjunctions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982736842105">
First, potential names were identified in the unannotated
data. This was done using the gazetteers which were
used for the first system, and a simple grammar of names.
Then we looked for all conjunctions of capitalized strings
in the unannotated data. If one of the strings was tagged
in its entirety as being of one NE type, and no other
strings in the conjunction had another NE tag, it was hy-
pothesized that all strings in this conjunction were of the
same type. All strings would then be stored in a gazetteer
of NEs of that type.
The next step was to add four more features to the
training and test sets of the NE system. In the training and
test texts, strings of capitalized words were matched with
the strings in the newly made gazetteers. All instances
were enlarged by four binary features, one for each type
of NE (L, M, O, P). These features are on when the fo-
cus word (and its context in the case of a longer name)
matches a string in the associated gazetteer, and off when
it does not.

4.2 Ratio of capitalized to non-capitalized
occurrence of tokens
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977444444444">
A last feature added to all instances indicated if the focus
word (the word to be classified) appears more often cap-
italized or uncapitalized in the unannotated corpus. This
approach has been used earlier by (Collins, 2002). In
order to make this feature, a list was made of all word-
forms, converted to lowercase, in the corpus, and the ra-
tio of capitalized to uncapitalized occurrences. The extra
feature was binary: on if a word appears more often cap-
italized than not, and off otherwise.

5 System 1: Discussion of results
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997505">
5.1 Role of gazetteers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981103">
Two experiments were run to assess the importance of
the gazetteers in this experiment: the first used only the
word to be classified and its context, the second used bi-
nary features indicating inclusion in gazetteers, as well
as the features used in the first experiment. Perhaps sur-
prisingly, the English system did worse when gazetteer
information was used. This was true using the default pa-
rameter settings, and also after (limited) separate param-
eter optimization. The German system did slightly better
on the development data when gazetteers were used.
The difference between the English and German sys-
tems is very surprising, as the lists were not adjusted to
include extra German names. They contain mainly En-
glish and Dutch names, as a result of previous work on
Dutch and English. In order to find an explanation, we
looked at the performance (not optimized) of the lists on
their own, not using any context or word-internal infor-
mation at all. The result did not make things at all clearer:
the precision of the lists on the German data was striking,
even more so than on the English data.

5.2 Type – token generalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959866666667">
Type-token generalization was attempted only on the En-
glish data. The intuition behind this approach is that a
memory-based learner may recognize a name due to its
context, but it will not generalize the classification to
other tokens of the same type. However, a concern is
that mistakes will be introduced by generalizing ambigu-
ous words to the wrong type, and by repeating mistakes
which would otherwise occur only sporadically. In the
end, introducing generalization did not make much of
a difference. While precision declines marginally (two
more phrases were incorrectly tagged as names), recall is
unaffected.
The results in Table 2 were derived using Timbl with
default parameters. The lack of optimization explains the
low result even without generalization.

5.3 Parameter optimization and feature selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99973075">
Parameter optimization was used both for system 1 and
for system 2. This was combined with limited feature
selection. The difference feature selection can make, is
already obvious from the results above, and will be shown

in the rest of the paper also. Parameter optimization can
have a major effect on performance of machine learning
systems in general, and Timbl in particular, as can be seen
in Table 3.
As was shown by Daelemans and Hoste (2002), param-
eter optimization and feature selection heavily interact in
machine learning: separate optimization leads to inferior
results to interleaved optimization. Different parameter
settings might be best for different feature selections, and
vice versa. It would therefore be best to optimize both
at the same time, treating feature selection and parameter
optimization together as one search space. This was done
to a very limited extent for this problem, but because of
the time needed for each experiment, a full search of the
solution space was impossible.
Another restriction is the fact that not all parameters of
the learner were optimized, again due to time constraints.
The two that were found to have a great effect were used
only. These are k, the number of nearest neighbours taken
into account when classifying a new instance, and m, the
feature metric. m was toggled between weighted overlap
and modified value difference.
The results shown in Table 3 are those on the consis-
tently best featureset found, i.e. the one using all infor-
mation minus gazetteers.
On the German data, parameter optimization and fea-
ture selection were also found to be beneficial, but opti-
mization had to be cut short due to time constraints.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989111111111">
In this system, extra information is added to the train-
ing set in the following way: the number of the instances
in the training set remains the same, but the number of
features for each instance is increased. The information
for the extra instances is found in the unannotated data,
so this should bring the benefit of using this extra infor-
mation source. At the same time, only the hand-tagged
training set is used, which means that no extra noise is
introduced into the training set.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999477">
6.1 Gazetteers extracted from conjunctions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887916666667">
In this step, four new features were added to each instance
in the training and test sets, one for each type of NE.
Even though gazetteers were already in use, we ex-
tracted new gazetteers from the unannotated data. The
hope was that these gazetteers would be more useful for
this particular task, as they would be corpus-specific. The
gazetteers which were used originally, and which did not
improve performance, were mainly taken off the inter-
net, and partially hand-crafted. This means that they are
general-purpose gazetteers. Also, they were a mixture
of Dutch and English names. The new gazetteers were
only English, and only included those names which were
found in the Reuters corpus.
Once the gazetteers were extracted, their entries were
matched against the text in the training data. When a
string of words in the training data matched a name, this
would be reflected in the new features. For example, if
New York was found both in the locations gazetteer and in
the training set, then both New and York would receive a
feature value Ltag (for location tag) for the newly added
location feature. The results in Table 4 show that this
strategy was successful.
The results were found using Timbl with default set-
tings.

Next, another feature was added to the training and test
instances. This feature is another binary feature, and it in-
dicates if the focus word of the instance is found more of-
ten in its capitalized form, or in its non-capitalized form.
This feature can help the process of NER in different
ways. One of them is the identification of sentence-initial
words. They are always capitalized in English, but if they
tend to appear uncapitalized more often, they are proba-
bly not a name. Another way they can help is in finding
words which are sometimes names, and sometimes ordi-
nary words (e.g. Apple). They should not be tagged as a
name if the uncapitalized version occurs more frequently.
This approach was also successful. Results shown in
Table 5 were once again obtained by using Timbl with
default settings.

Finally, all features were combined, and a number of op-

cuted. The best run found used all five of the extra fea-
tures derived from the unannotated data. This is good
news, because it means that using unannotated data can
help to improve NER of English.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983875">
In the plain learning problem (i.e. using only annotated
data), our system used only context and word-internal in-
formation. Type – token generalization was never benefi-
cial, and gazetteers helped only for the German task.
When using unannotated data, performance was im-
proved in two ways: extra gazetteers were constructed by
exploiting conjunctions, and words which appear mostly
in capitalized form were set apart from those that do not.
