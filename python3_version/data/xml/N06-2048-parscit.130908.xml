<bodyText confidence="0.999679222222222">
Images (i.e., figures or tables) are important ex-
perimental results that are typically reported in
bioscience full-text articles. Biologists need to
access the images to validate research facts and
to formulate or to test novel research hypothe-
ses. We designed, evaluated, and implemented a
novel user-interface, BioEx, that allows biolo-
gists to access images that appear in a full-text
article directly from the abstract of the article.

<bodyText confidence="0.997279565217391">
The rapid growth of full-text electronic publica-
tions in bioscience has made it necessary to cre-
ate information systems that allow biologists to
navigate and search efficiently among them. Im-
ages are usually important experimental results
that are typically reported in full-text bioscience
articles. An image is worth a thousand words.
Biologists need to access image data to validate
research facts and to formulate or to test novel
research hypotheses. Additionally, full-text arti-
cles are frequently long and typically incorpo-
rate multiple images. For example, we have
found an average of 5.2 images per biological
article in the journal Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Biologists need to
spend significant amount of time to read the full-
text articles in order to access specific images.
Figure 1. BioEx user-interface (as shown in A) is built upon the PubMed user-interface. Images
are shown as thumbnails at the bottom of a PubMed abstract. Images include both Figure and Ta-
ble. When a mouse (as shown as a hand in A) moves to “Fig x”, it shows the associated abstract
sentence(s) that link to the original figure that appears in the full-text articles. For example, “Fig
1” links to image B. “Related Text” provides links to other associated texts that correspond to the
image besides its image caption.

In order to facilitate biologists’ access to images,
we designed, evaluated, and implemented a
novel user-interface, BioEx, that allows biolo-
gists to access images that appear in a full-text
article directly from the abstract of the article. In
the following, we will describe the BioEx user-
interface, evaluation, and the implementation.

2. Data Collection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889636363636">
We hypothesize that images reported in a full-
text article can be summarized by sentences in
the abstract. To test this hypothesis, we ran-
domly selected a total of 329 biological articles
that are recently published in leading journals
Cell (104), EMBO (72), Journal of Biological
Chemistry (92), and Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences (PNAS) (61). For each arti-
cle, we e-mailed the corresponding author and
invited him or her to identify abstract sentences
that summarize image content in that article. In
order to eliminate the errors that may be intro-
duced by sentence boundary ambiguity, we
manually segmented the abstracts into sentences
and sent the sentences as the email attachments.
A total of 119 biologists from 19 countries par-
ticipated voluntarily the annotation to identify
abstract sentences that summarize figures or ta-
bles from 114 articles (39 Cells, 29 EMBO, 30
Journal of Biological Chemistry, and 16 PNAS),
a collection that is 34.7% of the total articles we
requested. The responding biologists included
the corresponding authors to whom we had sent
emails, as well as the first authors of the articles
to whom the corresponding authors had for-
warded our emails. None of the biologists or
authors were compensated.
This collection of 114 full-text articles incorpo-
rates 742 images and 826 abstract sentences.
The average number of images per document is
6.5±1.5 and the average number of sentences per
abstract is 7.2±1.9. Our data show that 87.9%
images correspond to abstract sentences and
66.5% of the abstract sentences correspond to
images. The data empirically validate our hy-
pothesis that image content can be summarized
by abstract sentences. Since an abstract is a sum-
mary of a full-text article, our results also em-
pirically validate that images are important
elements in full-text articles. This collection of
114 annotated articles was then used as the cor-
pus to evaluate automatic mapping of abstract
sentences to images using the natural language
processing approaches described in Section 4.

3. BioEx User-Interface Evaluation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955151515151">
In order to evaluate whether biologists would
prefer to accessing images from abstract sen-
tence links, we designed BioEx (Figure 1) and
two other baseline user-interfaces. BioEx is built
upon the PubMed user-interface except that im-
ages can be accessed by the abstract sentences.
We chose the PubMed user-interface because it
has more than 70 million hits a month and repre-
sents the most familiar user-interface to biolo-
gists. Other information systems have also
adapted the PubMed user-interface for similar
reasons (Smalheiser and Swanson 1998; Hearst
2003). The two other baseline user-interfaces
were the original PubMed user-interface and a
modified version of the SummaryPlus user-
interface, in which the images are listed as dis-
jointed thumbnails rather than related by abstract
sentences.
We asked the 119 biologists who linked sen-
tences to images in their publications to assign a
label to each of the three user-interfaces to be
“My favorite”, “My second favorite”, or “My
least favorite”. We designed the evaluation so
that a user-interface’s label is independent of the
choices of the other two user-interfaces.
A total of 41 or 34.5% of the biologists com-
pleted the evaluation in which 36 or 87.8% of
the total 41 biologists judged BioEx as “My fa-
vorite”. One biologist judged all three user-
interfaces to be “My favorite”. Five other biolo-
gists considered SummaryPlus as “My favorite”,
two of whom (or 4.9% of the total 41 biologists)
judged BioEx to be “My least favorite”.

4. Linking Abstract Sentences to Images
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975159">
We have explored hierarchical clustering algo-
rithms to cluster abstract sentences and image
captions based on lexical similarities.
Hierarchical clustering algorithms are well-
established algorithms that are widely used in
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99998795652174">
many other research areas including biological
sequence alignment (Corpet 1988), gene expres-
sion analyses (Herrero et al. 2001), and topic
detection (Lee et al. 2006). The algorithm starts
with a set of text (i.e., abstract sentences or im-
age captions). Each sentence or image caption
represents a document that needs to be clustered.
The algorithm identifies pair-wise document
similarity based on the TF*IDF weighted cosine
similarity. It then merges the two documents
with the highest similarity into one cluster. It
then re-evaluates pairs of documents/clusters;
two clusters can be merged if the average simi-
larity across all pairs of documents within the
two clusters exceeds a predefined threshold. In
presence of multiple clusters that can be merged
at any time, the pair of clusters with the highest
similarity is always preferred.
In our application, if abstract sentences belong
to the same cluster that includes images cap-
tions, the abstract sentences summarize the im-
age content of the corresponded images. The
clustering model is advantageous over other
models in that the flexibility of clustering meth-
ods allows “many-to-many” mappings. That is a
sentence in the abstract can be mapped to zero,
one or more than one images and an image can
be mapped to zero, one or more than one ab-
stract sentences.
We explored different learning features, weights
and clustering algorithms to link abstract sen-
tences to images. We applied the TF*IDF
weighted cosine similarity for document cluster-
ing. We treat each sentence or image caption as
a “document” and the features are bag-of-words.
We tested three different methods to obtain the
IDF value for each word feature: 1)
IDF(abstract+caption): the IDF values were
calculated from the pool of abstract sentences
and image captions; 2) IDF(full-text): the IDF
values were calculated from all sentences in the
full-text article; and 3)
IDF(abstract)::IDF(caption): two sets of IDF
values were obtained. For word features that
appear in abstracts, the IDF values were calcu-
lated from the abstract sentences. For words that
appear in image captions, the IDF values were
calculated from the image captions.
The positions of abstract sentences or images are
important. The chance that two abstract sen-
tences link to an image decreases when the dis-
tance between two abstract sentences increases.
For example, two consecutive abstract sentences
have a higher probability to link to one image
than two abstract sentences that are far apart.
Two consecutive images have a higher chance to
link to the same abstract sentence than two im-
ages that are separated by many other images.
Additionally, sentence positions in an abstract
seem to correspond to image positions. For ex-
ample, the first sentences in an abstract have
higher probabilities than the last sentences to
link to the first image.
To integrate such “neighboring effect” into our
existing hierarchical clustering algorithms, we
modified the TF*IDF weighted cosine similar-
ity. The TF*IDF weighted cosine similarity for a
pair of documents i and j is Sim(i,j), and the final
similarity metric W(i,j) is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9991026">
W i j Sim i j
( )
, = ( , ) * (1 ( /
−abs P i T i Pj Tj
− / ))
</equation>
<listItem confidence="0.826705866666666">
1. If i and j are both abstract sentences,
Ti=Tj=total number of abstract sentences; and
Pi and Pj represents the positions of sentences i
and j in the abstract.
2. If i and j are both image captions,
Ti=Tj=total number of images that appear in a
full-text article; and Pi and Pj represents the
positions of images i and j in the full-text arti-
cle.
3. If i and j are an abstract sentence and an
image caption, respectively, Ti=total number
of abstract sentences and Tj=total number of
images that appear in a full-text article; and Pi
and Pj represent the positions of abstract sen-
tence i and image j.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.901589">
Finally, we explored three clustering strategies;
namely, per-image, per-abstract sentence, and
mix.
The Per-image strategy clusters each image
caption with all abstract sentences. The image is
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997063">

<bodyText confidence="0.9998636">
assigned to (an) abstract sentence(s) if it belongs
to the same cluster. This method values features
in abstract sentences more than image captions
because the decision that an image belongs to (a)
sentence(s) depends upon the features from all
abstract sentences and the examined image cap-
tion. The features from other image captions do
not play a role in the clustering methodology.
The Per-abstract-sentence strategy takes each
abstract sentence and clusters it with all image
captions that appear in a full-text article. Images
are assigned to the sentence if they belong to the
same cluster. This method values features in im-
age captions higher than the features in abstract
sentences because the decision that an abstract
sentence belongs to image(s) depends upon the
features from the image captions and the exam-
ined abstract sentence. Similar to per-image
clustering, the features from other abstract sen-
tences do not play a role in the clustering meth-
odology.
The Mix strategy clusters all image captions
with all abstract sentences. This method treats
features in abstract sentences and image captions
equally.

5. Results and Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999472294117647">
Figures 2 - 4 show the results from three differ-
ent combinations of features and algorithms with
varied TF*IDF thresholds. The default parame-
ters for all these experiments were “per image”,
“bag-of-words”, and “without neighboring
weight”.
Figure 2 shows that the “global” IDFs, or the
IDFs obtained from the full-text article, have a
much lower performance than “local” IDFs, or
IDFs calculated from the abstract sentences and
image captions. Figure 3 shows that Per-image
out-performs the other two strategies. The re-
sults suggest that features in abstract sentences
are more useful than features that reside within
captions for the task of clustering. Figure 4
shows that the “neighboring weighted” approach
offers significant enhancement over the TF*IDF
weighted approach. When the recall is 33%, the
precision of “neighboring weighted” approach
increases to 72% from the original 38%, which
corresponds to a 34% increase. The results
strongly indicate the importance of the
“neighboring effect” or positions of additional
features. When the precision is 100%, the recall
is 4.6%. We believe BioEx system is applicable
for real use because a high level of precision is
the key to BioEx success.
