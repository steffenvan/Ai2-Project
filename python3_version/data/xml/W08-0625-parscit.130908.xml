1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999062487179487">
Through advanced technologies in clinical care
and research, especially the rapid progress in imag-
ing technologies, more and more medical imaging
data and patient text data is generated by hospitals,
pharmaceutical companies, and medical research.
For enabling advanced access to clinical imaging
and text data, it is relevant to know what kind of
knowledge the clinician wants to know or the que-
ries that clinicians are interested in. Through inten-
sive interviews and discussions with radiologists
and clinicians, we have learned that medical imag-
ing data is analyzed - and hence queried – from
three different perspectives, i.e. the anatomic per-
spective addressing the involved body parts, the
radiology-specific spatial perspective describing
the relationships of located anatomical regions to
other anatomical parts, and the disease perspective
distinguishing between normal and abnormal im-
aging features. Our aim is to establish query pat-
terns reflecting those three perspectives that would
typically be used by clinicians and radiologists to
find patient-specific sets of relevant images.
The context of our work is in the Theseus-
MEDICO1 project on cross-modal image and in-
formation retrieval in the medical domain. The
focus of the work reported here is on setting up
Wikipedia-based corpora of human anatomy and
radiology and on obtaining a statistical profile of
concepts from three semantic knowledge resources
with these corpora: the Foundational Model of
Anatomy (FMA), the radiology lexicon RadLex,
and a subset of the international classification of
disease codes ICD-9 CM. Using this information,
we intend to extract relations that are likely to oc-
cur between statistically relevant terms and the
concepts they express.
The final goal of our work is to derive potential
query patterns from the extracted set of relations
that can be used in the MEDICO semantic-based

image retrieval application. For example when re-
staging head and neck lymphoma, clinicians and
radiologists look for information and images that
report on essential radiological patterns as “an
enlargement in the dimension of the lymph node in
the neck”. Therefore, within our approach, we aim
at establishing hypotheses about possible user que-
ries, i.e. the query patterns that reflect the three
perspectives discussed above. Accordingly, an ex-
ample query pattern might look like this:

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.984563333333333">
Once an initial set of similar patterns has been es-
tablished in this way, they will be evaluated by
clinicians for their validity and relevance.

A central aspect of the query pattern mining task is
the statistical analysis of the FMA and RadLex
terms in relevant text collections. In this way rele-
vance scores can be assigned to terms that allow to
investigate the most likely expressed (and hence
queried) relations between them. For this purpose
we need access to a representative corpus of texts
that at the same time reflects the joint view of
anatomy, spatial aspects of radiology and disease
that we are targeting. Patient records would be our
first choice, but due to strict anonymization re-
quirements these are difficult to obtain. We there-
fore constructed a corpus based on the Wikipedia
Categories Anatomy and Radiology. We then ran
all text sections of each corpus through a part-of-
speech tagger (Brants, 2000) to extract all nouns in
the corpus and to compute a relevance score (chi-
square) for each by comparing anatomy and radi-
ology frequencies with those in the British Na-

3 FMA Terms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999436105263158">
The statistically most relevant FMA terms were
identified on the basis of chi-square scores com-
puted for nouns in each corpus. Single word terms
in the FMA and occurring in the corpus correspond
directly to the noun that the term is build up of
(e.g. the noun ‘ear’ corresponds to the FMA term
ear). In this case, the statistical relevance of the
term is the chi-square score of the corresponding
noun. In the case of multi-word terms occurring in
the corpus, the statistical relevance is computed on
the basis of the chi-square score for each constitut-
ing noun and/or adjective in the term, summed and
normalized over the length of the term. Thus, the
relevance value for lymph node is the summation
of chi-square scores for ‘lymph’ and ‘node’ di-
vided by 2. In order to take frequency in account,
we further multiplied the summed relevance value
by the frequency of the term. This assures that only
frequently occurring terms are judged as relevant.

Analogously, RadLex was used to identify the
most relevant radiology terms. The most relevant
RadLex terms are shown below. As with the FMA,
the most relevant RadLex terms in the anatomy
corpus are centered on “artery”. In contrast, in the
radiology corpus the RadLex relevance scores in-
deed point to a radiology profile:

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905375">
Using ICD-9 lymphoma terminology, we will
derive a Pubmed-based corpus on lymphoma to
analyse the context of the statistically top most
relevant terms from the FMA and RadLex termi-
nologies. In this way we will be able to identify
relationships and eventually query patterns across
the three dimensions of anatomy, radiology and
lymphoma research.
