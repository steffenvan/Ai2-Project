Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999866103448276">
Sentiment analysis is one of the hot de-
manding research areas since last few dec-
ades. Although a formidable amount of
research have been done, the existing re-
ported solutions or available systems are
still far from perfect or do not meet the sa-
tisfaction level of end users’. The main is-
sue is the various conceptual rules that
govern sentiment and there are even more
clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey
these concepts from realization to verbali-
zation of a human being. Human psycholo-
gy directly relates to the unrevealed clues
and governs the sentiment realization of us.
Human psychology relates many things
like social psychology, culture, pragmatics
and many more endless intelligent aspects
of civilization. Proper incorporation of hu-
man psychology into computational senti-
ment knowledge representation may solve
the problem. In the present paper we pro-
pose a template based online interactive
gaming technology, called Dr Sentiment to
automatically create the PsychoSenti-
WordNet involving internet population.
The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension
of SentiWordNet that presently holds hu-
man psychological knowledge on a few as-
pects along with sentiment knowledge.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999731">
In order to identify sentiment from a text, lexical
analysis plays a crucial role. For example, words
like love, hate, good and favorite directly indicate
sentiment or opinion. Previous works (Pang et al.,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.960462148148148">
2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Baccianella et.
al., 2010) have already proposed various tech-
niques for making dictionaries for those sentiment
words. But polarity assignment of such sentiment
lexicons is a hard semantic disambiguation prob-
lem. The regulating aspects which govern the lexi-
cal level semantic orientation are natural language
context (Pang et al., 2002), language properties
(Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic
knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimen-
sion (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparava
and Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hid-
den aspects. Therefore it is a challenging and
enigmatic research problem.
The current trend is to attach prior polarity to
each entry at the sentiment lexicon level. Prior po-
larity is an approximation value based on heuristics
based statistics collected from corpus and not ex-
act. The probabilistic fixed point prior polarity
scores do not solve the problem completely rather
it places the problem into next level, called contex-
tual polarity classification.
We start with the hypothesis that the summation
of all the regulating aspects of sentiment orienta-
tion is human psychology and thus it is a multi-
faceted problem (Liu, 2010). More precisely what
we mean by human psychology is the union of all
known and unknown aspects that directly or indi-
rectly govern the sentiment orientation knowledge
of us. The regulating aspects wrapped in the
present PsychoSentiWordNet are Gender, Age,
City, Country, Language and Profession.
The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension of the
existing SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et. al.,
2010) to hold the possible psychological ingre-
dients and govern the sentiment understandability
of us. The PsychoSentiWordNet holds variable
prior polarity scores that could be fetched depend-
ing upon those psychological regulating aspects.

The lexicons tagged by this system are credible
as it is tagged by human beings. It is not a static
sentiment lexicon set [polarity changes with time
(Read, 2005)] as it is updated regularly. Around
10-20 players each day are playing it throughout
the world in different languages. The average
number of tagging per word is about 7.47 till date.
The Sign Up form of the “Dr Sentiment” game
asks the player to provide personal information
such as Sex, Age, City, Country, Language and
Profession. These collected personal details of a
player are kept as a log record in the database.
The gaming interface has four types of question
templates. The question templates are named as
Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.
2 Dr Sentiment
Dr Sentiment1 is a template based interactive on-
line game, which collects player’s sentiment by
asking a set of simple template based questions and
finally reveals a player’s sentimental status. Dr
Sentiment fetches random words from Senti-
WordNet synsets and asks every player to tell
about his/her sentiment polarity understanding re-
garding the concept behind the word fetched by it.
There are several motivations behind developing
the intuitive game to automatically collect human
psycho-sentimental orientation information.
In the history of Information Retrieval research
there is a milestone when ESP game2 (Ahn et al.,
2004) innovated the concept of a game to automat-
ically label images available in the World Wide
Web. It has been identified as the most reliable
strategy to automatically annotate the online im-

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972230769231">
Dr Sentiment asks 30 questions to each player.
There are predefined distributions of each question
type as 11 for Q1, 11 for Q2, 4 for Q3 and 4 for
Q4. These numbers are arbitrarily chosen and ran-
domly changed for experimentation. The questions
are randomly asked to keep the game more inter-
esting. For word based translation Google transla-
tion5 service has been used. At each Question (Q)
level translation service has been used to display
the sentiment word into player’s own language.
Google API provides multiple senses for word lev-
el translation and currently only the first sense has
been picked automatically.

more positive than other. Table 3 shows how in
SentiWordNet relative scoring has been made.
With the present gaming technology relative polar-
ity scoring has been assigned to each n-n word pair
combination.
Randomly n (presently 2-4) words have been
chosen from the source SentiWordNet synsets
along with their images as retrieved by Google

them that he/she likes most. The relative score is
calculated and stored in the corresponding log ta-

2.7 Dr Sentiment’s Prescription
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995347826087">
The final prescription depends on various factors
such as total number of positive, negative or neu-
tral comments and the total time taken by any
player. The final prescription also depends on the
range of the accumulated values of all the above
factors.
This is the most important appealing factor to a
player. The motivating message for players is that
Dr Sentiment can reveal their sentimental status:
whether they are extreme negative or positive or
very much neutral or diplomatic etc. It is not
claimed that the revealed status of a player by Dr
Sentiment is exact or ideal. It is only to make the
players motivated but the outcomes of the game
effectively helps to store human sentimental psy-
chology in terms of computational lexicon.
A word previously tagged by a player is avoided
by the tracking system during subsequent turns by
the same player. The intension is to tag more and
more words involving Internet population. We ob-
serve that the strategy helps to keep the game in-
teresting as a large number of players return to
play the game after this strategy was implemented.

The word “blue” gets tagged by different players
around the world. But surprisingly it has been
tagged as positive from one part of the world and
negative from another part of the world. The

negative tags are coming from the middle-east and
especially from the Islamic countries.

We found a line in Wiki6 (see in Religion Section)

for evil doers whose eyes are glazed with fear”.
But other explanations may be there for this situa-

6 Conclusion and Future Directions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944047619048">
In the present paper the development of the Psy-
choSentiWordNet for 56 languages has been de-
scribed. No evaluation has been done yet as there
is no data available for this kind of experimenta-
tion and to the best of our knowledge this is the
first endeavor where sentiment analysis meets AI
and psychology.
Our present goal is to collect such corpus and
carry out experiments to check whether variable
prior polarity scores of PsychoSentiWordNet excel
over the fixed point prior polarity score of Senti-
WordNet.
Automatically picked first sense from Google
translation API may cause difficulties for cross
lingual projection of sentiment synsets. Erroneous
outputs from API may also cause some problems.
But these problems lead to another research issue
that may be termed as cross lingual sentiment syn-
set linking. Presently we are giving a closer look to
the qualitative analysis of developed multilingual
psycho-sentiment lexicons.

<abstract confidence="0.998918966666667">Sentiment analysis is one of the hot demanding research areas since last few decades. Although a formidable amount of research have been done, the existing reported solutions or available systems are still far from perfect or do not meet the satisfaction level of end users’. The main issue is the various conceptual rules that govern sentiment and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being. Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues and governs the sentiment realization of us. Human psychology relates many things like social psychology, culture, pragmatics and many more endless intelligent aspects of civilization. Proper incorporation of human psychology into computational sentiment knowledge representation may solve the problem. In the present paper we propose a template based online interactive technology, called Sentiment create the PsychoSentiinternet population. The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension of SentiWordNet that presently holds human psychological knowledge on a few aspects along with sentiment knowledge.</abstract>
