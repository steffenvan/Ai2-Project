Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999585785714286">
In social psychology, it is generally accepted
that one discloses more of his/her personal in-
formation to someone in a strong relationship.
We present a computational framework for au-
tomatically analyzing such self-disclosure be-
havior in Twitter conversations. Our frame-
work uses text mining techniques to discover
topics, emotions, sentiments, lexical patterns,
as well as personally identifiable information
(PII) and personally embarrassing information
(PEI). Our preliminary results illustrate that in
relationships with high relationship strength,
Twitter users show significantly more frequent
behaviors of self-disclosure.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999726">
We often self-disclose, that is, share our emotions,
personal information, and secrets, with our friends,
family, coworkers, and even strangers. Social psy-
chologists say that the degree of self-disclosure in a
relationship depends on the strength of the relation-
ship, and strategic self-disclosure can strengthen the
relationship (Duck, 2007). In this paper, we study
whether relationship strength has the same effect on
self-disclosure of Twitter users.
To do this, we first present a method for compu-
tational analysis of self-disclosure in online conver-
sations and show promising results. To accommo-
date the largely unannotated nature of online conver-
sation data, we take a topic-model based approach
(Blei et al., 2003) for discovering latent patterns that
reveal self-disclosure. A similar approach was able
to discover sentiments (Jo and Oh, 2011) and emo-
tions (Kim et al., 2012) from user contents. Prior
work on self-disclosure for online social networks
has been from communications research (Jiang et
al., 2011; Humphreys et al., 2010) which relies
on human judgements for analyzing self-disclosure.
The limitation of such research is that the data is
small, so our approach of automatic analysis of self-
disclosure will be able to show robust results over a
much larger data set.
Analyzing relationship strength in online social
networks has been done for Facebook and Twitter
in (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2009; Gilbert, 2012) and
for enterprise SNS (Wu et al., 2010). In this paper,
we estimate relationship strength simply based on
the duration and frequency of interaction. We then
look at the correlation between self-disclosure and
relationship strength and present the preliminary re-
sults that show a positive and significant correlation.

2 Data and Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935333333333">
Twitter is widely used for conversations (Ritter et al.,
2010), and prior work has looked at Twitter for dif-
ferent aspects of conversations (Boyd et al., 2010;
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011; Ritter et al.,
2011). Ours is the first paper to analyze the degree
of self-disclosure in conversational tweets. In this
section, we describe the details of our Twitter con-
versation data and our methodology for analyzing
relationship strength and self-disclosure.

three conversations from October, 2011 to Decem-
ber, 2011 and collected their tweets for that dura-
tion. To protect users’ privacy, we anonymized the
data to remove all identifying information. This
dataset consists of 131,633 users, 2,283,821 chains
and 11,196,397 tweets.

2.2 Relationship Strength
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942666666667">
Research in social psychology shows that relation-
ship strength is characterized by interaction fre-
quency and closeness of a relationship between
two people (Granovetter, 1973; Levin and Cross,
2004). Hence, we suggest measuring the relation-
ship strength of the conversational dyads via the fol-
lowing two metrics. Chain frequency (CF) mea-
sures the number of conversational chains between
the dyad averaged per month. Chain length (CL)
measures the length of conversational chains be-
tween the dyad averaged per month. Intuitively, high
CF or CL for a dyad means the relationship is strong.

2.3 Self-Disclosure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999698583333333">
Social psychology literature asserts that self-
disclosure consists of personal information and open
communication composed of the following five ele-
ments (Montgomery, 1982).
Negative openness is how much disagreement
or negative feeling one expresses about a situation
or the communicative partner. In Twitter conver-
sations, we analyze sentiment using the aspect and
sentiment unification model (ASUM) (Jo and Oh,
2011), based on LDA (Blei et al., 2003). ASUM
uses a set of seed words for an unsupervised dis-
covery of sentiments. We use positive and negative
emoticons from Wikipedia.org1. Nonverbal open-
ness includes facial expressions, vocal tone, bod-
ily postures or movements. Since tweets do not
show these, we look at emoticons, ‘lol’ (laughing
out loud) and ‘xxx’ (kisses) for these nonverbal ele-
ments. According to Derks et al. (2007), emoticons
are used as substitutes for facial expressions or vocal
tones in socio-emotional contexts. We also consider
profanity as nonverbal openness. The methodology
used for identifying profanity is described in the next
section. Emotional openness is how much one dis-
closes his/her feelings and moods. To measure this,

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.997627571428571">
we look for tweets that contain words that are iden-
tified as the most common expressions of feelings in
blogs as found in Harris and Kamvar (2009). Recep-
tive openness and General-style openness are diffi-
cult to get from tweets, and they are not defined pre-
cisely in the literature, so we do not consider these
here.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996233">
2.4 PII, PEI, and Profanity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999642416666667">
PII and PEI are also important elements of self-
disclosure. Automatically identifying these is quite
difficult, but there are certain topics that are indica-
tive of PII and PEI, such as family, money, sick-
ness and location, so we can use a widely-used topic
model, LDA (Blei et al., 2003) to discover topics
and annotate them using MTurk2 for PII and PEI,
and profanity. We asked the Turkers to read the con-
versation chains representing the topics discovered
by LDA and have them mark the conversations that
contain PII and PEI. From this annotation, we iden-
tified five topics for profanity, ten topics for PII, and
eight topics for PEI. Fleiss kappa of MTurk result
is 0.07 for PEI, and 0.10 for PII, and those numbers
signify slight agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977).
Table 1 shows some of the PII and PEI topics. The
profanity words identified this way include nigga,
lmao, shit, fuck, lmfao, ass, bitch.

To verify the topic-model based approach to dis-
covering PII and PEI, we tried supervised classifi-
cation using SVM on document-topic proportions.
Precision and recall are 0.23 and 0.21 for PII, and
0.30 and 0.23 for PEI. These results are not quite
good, but this is a difficult task even for humans,
and we had a low agreement among the Turkers. So
our current work is in improving this.

<bodyText confidence="0.999674607142857">
Chain frequency (CF) and chain length (CL) reflect
the dyad’s tweeting behaviors. In figure 1, we can
see that the two metrics show similar patterns of
self-disclosure. When two users have stronger rela-
tionships, they show more negative openness, non-
verbal openness, profanity, and PEI. These patterns
are expected. However, weaker relationships tend
to show more PII and emotions. A closer look at the
data reveals that PII topics are related to cities where
they live, time of day, and birthday. This shows
that the weaker relationships, usually new acquain-
tances, use PII to introduce themselves or send triv-
ial greetings for birthdays. Higher emotional open-
ness in weaker relationships looks strange at first,
but similar to PII, emotion in weak relationships is
usually expressed as greetings, reactions to baby or
pet photos, or other shallow expressions.
It is interesting to look at outliers, dyads with very
strong and very weak relationship groups. Table 3
summarizes the self-disclosure behaviors of these
outliers. There is a clear pattern that stronger re-
lationships show more nonverbal openness, nega-

tive openness, profanity use, and PEI. In figure 1,
emotional openness does not differ for the strong
and weak relationship groups. We can see why this
is when we look at the topics for the strong and
weak groups. Table 2 shows the topics that are
most prominent in the strong relationships, and they
include daily greetings, plans, nonverbal emotions
such as ‘lol’, ‘omg’, and profanity. In weak relation-
ships, the prominent topics illustrate the prevalence
of initial getting-to-know conversations in Twitter.
They welcome and greet each other about kids and
pets, and offer sympathies about feeling bad.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999617214285714">
We looked at the relationship strength in Twitter
conversational partners and how much they self-
disclose to each other. We found that people dis-
close more to closer friends, confirming the social
psychology studies, but people show more positive
sentiment to weak relationships rather than strong
relationships. This reflects the social norm toward
first-time acquaintances on Twitter. Also, emotional
openness does not change significantly with rela-
tionship strength. We think this may be due to the in-
herent difficulty in truly identifying the emotions on
Twitter. Identifying emotion merely based on key-
words captures mostly shallow emotions, and deeper
emotional openness either does not occur much on

Twitter or cannot be captures very well.
With our automatic analysis, we showed that
when Twitter users have conversations, they con-
trol self-disclosure depending on the relationship
strength. We showed the results of measuring the re-
lationship strength of a Twitter conversational dyad
with chain frequency and length. We also showed
the results of automatically analyzing self-disclosure
behaviors using topic modeling.
This is ongoing work, and we are looking to im-
prove methods for analyzing relationship strength
and self-disclosure, especially emotions, PII and
PEI. For relationship strength, we will consider not
only interaction frequency, but also network distance
and relationship duration. For finding emotions, first
we will adapt existing models (Vaassen and Daele-
mans, 2011; Tokuhisa et al., 2008) and suggest a
new semi-supervised model. For finding PII and
PEI, we will not only consider the topics, but also
time, place and the structure of questions and an-
swers. This paper is a starting point that has shown
some promising research directions for an important
problem.

We asked the Turkers to read the conversation chains representing the topics discovered by LDA and have them mark the conversations that contain PII and PEI. From this annotation, we identified five topics for profanity, ten topics for PII, and eight topics for PEI. Fleiss kappa of MTurk result is 0.07 for PEI, and 0.10 for PII, and those numbers signify slight agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). Table 1 shows some of the PII and PEI topics.

Our preliminary results illustrate that in relationships with high relationship strength, Twitter users show significantly more frequent behaviors of self-disclosure. 1 Introduction We often self-disclose, that is, share our emotions, personal information, and secrets, with our friends, family, coworkers, and even strangers. Social psychologists say that the degree of self-disclosure in a relationship depends on the strength of the relationship, and strategic self-disclosure can strengthen the relationship (Duck, 2007). In this paper, we study whether relationship strength has the same effect on self-disclosure of Twitter users. To do this, we first present a method for computational analysis of self-disclosure in online conversations and show promising results. To accommodate the largely unannotated nature of online conversation data, we take a topic-model based approach (Blei et al., 2003) for discovering latent patterns that reveal self-disclosure. A similar approach was able to discover sentiments (Jo and Oh, 2011) and emotions (Kim et al., 2012) from user contents. Prior work on self-disclosure for onl</context>

In Twitter conversations, we analyze sentiment using the aspect and sentiment unification model (ASUM) (Jo and Oh, 2011), based on LDA (Blei et al., 2003). ASUM uses a set of seed words for an unsupervised discovery of sentiments. We use positive and negative emoticons from Wikipedia.org1. Nonverbal openness includes facial expressions, vocal tone, bodily postures or movements. Since tweets do not show these, we look at emoticons, ‘lol’ (laughing out loud) and ‘xxx’ (k</context>

Prior work on self-disclosure for online social networks has been from communications research (Jiang et al., 2011; Humphreys et al., 2010) which relies on human judgements for analyzing self-disclosure. The limitation of such research is that the data is small, so our approach of automatic analysis of selfdisclosure will be able to show robust results over a much larger data set.
