In this paper, we present a method for generating French texts conveying temporal information
that integrates Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) and Systemic Grammar Theory. DRT
is used to represent temporal information and an intermediate semantic level for the temporal
localization expressed by temporal adverbial phrases and verb phrases. This representation is
then translated into a syntactic form using Systemic Grammar Theory. We have implemented
this method in a working prototype called Pretexte.

In speaker-generated texts, reference is made to facts taking place in time. To use the
same kind of references in automatically generated text, the mechanisms that govern
the expression of temporal concepts must be identified. There is no simple or direct
mapping between conceptual time, as it is perceived in the real world, and linguistic
time, which refers to the way time is formulated in language. There may be different
ways to present the same temporal concept in a text, and a single linguistic marker
can be used to convey different temporal meanings.
For example, the discourse below (Discourse 1) is a text generated by Pretexte,
a system we developed for implementing the expression of temporal localization in
French textsl. It is a slightly modified version of an example used by Bras (1990) for the
extraction of temporal information in text analysis. The sentences report occurrences
that are facts taking place in time. We have inserted labels in parentheses to distinguish
the twelve occurrences reported in the text.

In Discourse 1, we find two types of temporal markers: verb tense and what we
call adverbials of temporal location (ATL). An ATL is an adjunct, such as yesterday,
until 10:50, or when it flew over Barcelona, that provides information about the temporal
localization of an occurrence or its duration, or both at the same time.
For verb tense, we distinguish different ways of indicating localization in the past.
Three French verb tenses can be used: passe cornpose, imparfait, and plus-que-parfait; their
closest equivalents in English are the simple past, past progressive, and past perfect.
The passé compose il a survole &apos;it flew over&apos; presents the occurrence as an event and
localizes it in relation to the time of speech. With the plus-que-parfait ii s&apos;etait allume &apos;it
had come on&apos;, the occurrence is also presented as an event, but localized in relation
to a perspective point other than speech time. The imparfait le reacteur fonctionnait &apos;the
engine was working&apos; presents the occurrence as being in progress. For present and
future tenses there are fewer options than for past tense, but more than one form is
available for theses tenses as well.
For ATLs, temporal localization can be achieved in many ways; for example, in
relation to the time of speech (hier &apos;yesterday&apos;), by designating an absolute temporal
location (a 8h00 &apos;at 8:00 A.m.&apos;), or in relation to another fact (puis &apos;then&apos;, a ce moment-id
&apos;at this moment&apos;, quand il a survole Barcelone &apos;when it flew over Barcelona&apos;). To this
variety in the semantics of localization we must add the variety of syntactic forms.
Localization can be expressed by an adverb (puis &apos;then&apos;), a prepositional phrase (jusqu&apos;d
10h50 &apos;until 10:50&apos;), a nominal phrase (le lendemain &apos;the day after&apos;) or a subordinate
clause (quand il a survole Barcelone &apos;when it flew over Barcelona&apos;).
No text generator has yet been developed to solve the problem of the expression
of time. The ones that have tackled this problem have focused on the production of
verb tenses, without solving the choice of temporal adverbs. The work presented in
this paper addresses the problem of generating the elements that convey temporal
localization in French, including both verbs and temporal adverbs.
In a previous paper (Gagnon and Lapalme 1992), we proposed a method of inte-
grating the expression of temporal concepts into the text-generation process. In par-
ticular, we showed how to produce different types of text in French from a single
representation of events. Unfortunately, the method governing the planning process
was too determined by temporal concepts, so it was difficult to link this planning
process with other frameworks, such as the schema proposed by McKeown (1985) or
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann 1991; Hovy 1991).
As we were not really successful in integrating the expression of time in French
into the text-generation process, we decided to pursue our research with a different
perspective. We designed a system covering many of the possibilities of expressing
time in French, our hypothesis being that the achievement of this task would facilitate
the design of a text-planning process. We believed it would be easier to organize the
structure of the discourse with a better understanding of the way temporal information
can be expressed by adverbs and verb tenses. We started from the work of Bras (1990),
who proposes a method of extracting the temporal structure of a text, according to
Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981), that relies on an analysis of adverbials
of temporal location made by Molines (1990).
To implement the production of ATLs and verb tenses, we have chosen Systemic
Grammar (Halliday 1985; Berry 1975, 1976), which formulates the syntactic structure
of a sentence as the result of a sequence of semantic choices. We developed a grammar
interpreter inspired by Nigel (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991), but departing from it
in many respects; in particular, our representation of the production of verb tenses
and adverbs is quite different.
In this paper, we discuss the elements required to produce a text such as Dis-

course 1. The process starts from a conceptual representation that encodes the facts to
be reported in the text, associated with their position in time. The information at this
objective conceptual level must be translated into a semantic representation where the
facts are presented according to a subjective perspective. The semantic representation
is then used to produce the text. We have concentrated our attention on this last stage,
but we cannot avoid the problem of determining how the representation used at this
level is obtained from previous levels. In the following sections, we describe the two
stages of the text-generation process.

It is generally accepted that the generation process requires at least two parts. The
first part, deep generation, is a planning process in which the content and the overall
structure of the text are established. In the second part, surface generation, the words
and the syntactic structure of the text are chosen.
Figure 1 summarizes our view of the global process, starting from a conceptual
representation that contains occurrences and relations between them. The fact that
an occurrence takes place at a certain time is expressed by an overlapping relation
between this occurrence and the object representing this time.
The deep generation process is decomposed into two steps. In the first step, the
conceptual representation is segmented and structured to build a discourse represen-
tation. In our discourse representation, which uses Segmented Discourse Representa-

tion Theory (SDRT) (Asher 1993), the information is cut into smaller segments each
of which contains the information to be expressed by a single sentence. The structure
linking these segments relies on a set of rhetorical relations.
In the second step of the deep generation process, the discourse representation
is traversed and, for each segment, rules are applied to identify the feature values
needed to translate it into a sentence. We thus obtain a linear structure in which each
element is a set of features that determine the syntactic form of the sentence.
In the surface generation process, the information in the semantic representation
is used to select the appropriate syntactic structure for the expression of time: an
adverbial of temporal location (ATL) or a verb phrase (VP), or both.

Although our work focuses on surface generation, we cannot ignore the issue of deep
generation, because the nature of the semantic representation is determined not only
by the syntax of the language, but also by the temporal concepts available. Therefore,
in this section, we first present the conceptual representation that induces the semantic
representation used by our generator. We then explain the intermediate discourse level.
We do not know yet in detail how to produce the semantic representation from the
conceptual representation, but we do have an idea of what information each level
of representation must contain and what choices must be made at each stage of the
process.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875909090909">
To represent temporal concepts in Pretexte, we chose the principles of Discourse Rep-
resentation Theory (DRT), which offers one of the most interesting explanations of
how temporal notions are conveyed by a text. DRT was developed to deal with spe-
cific problems of discourse understanding: in particular, problems with anaphora and
the differences between some verb tenses, with respect to temporal localization. Our
goal is not to show how this theory can be used for generation but rather to use its
principles as a convenient formalism for the representation of time.
In DRT, a text is associated with a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) that
is updated incrementally by the processing of each sentence. A DRS is a structure
containing a set of entities and a set of conditions on these entities. There are different
types of entities in DRT:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9977756">
• a temporal fact can either be presented as an event (having a punctual
aspect), or as a situation (having a certain extent in time, but considered
from an internal perspective at a given moment in time);
• a temporal constant that designates a segment of the temporal axis;
• entities that participate in the events or situations.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998693714285714">
In Pretexte, conceptual knowledge is represented as a DRS, which we adapted slightly
for text generation. We do not distinguish between events and situations in the concep-
tual representation, because we want this level to remain independent of the language.
Furthermore, we feel that this distinction should not be encoded at the conceptual
level, rather the generation system should choose among these possibilities. There-
fore, at the conceptual level we use the concept of occurrence for either an event or a
situation.

Conceptual representation for the first three sentences of Discourse 1.
There are essentially two ways of considering time or, to be more precise, the
notion of temporal location: either temporal location is determined using a preexisting
time scale, or it is deduced from the occurrence. Following Kamp (1981), we think that
the second possibility, in which temporal location is a relative concept, is more suitable
for natural text processing. Treating occurrences as entities, rather than making them
subordinate to temporal intervals or points, has been proposed by Davidson (1967).
An occurrence may be represented in relation to another temporal object, without
any reference to its own location in time. This approach eases the representation of
underspecified temporal localizers—an important point for our semantics. For further
discussion of the advantages of taking occurrences as primitives, see (Bras 1990; Kamp
1979, 1981).
In the conceptual representation, we find four types of information:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992309333333333">
• the description of occurrences;
• the description of participants in the occurrences;
• the description of temporal localizers, which are called temporal
constants (they usually refer to time periods of the calendar);
• temporal relations between occurrences and temporal localizers:
— The relation &lt; represents temporal precedence.

<bodyText confidence="0.607248666666667">
_ The overlap relation 0 indicates that two temporal objects are
somehow simultaneous. Thus, in our representation, &amp;quot;Y happens

temporal object is a subset of the temporal extent of another
object.

these temporal constants are to be described in DRT, so we have proposed elsewhere
a formalization of the type of objects designated by these constants (Gagnon and Bras
1994). In this article, we give only an English description of them: n represents speech
time, which, in Figure 2, is included in the time represented by t3 (September 111992).
Four occurrences are represented: 01, 02, 03, and 04, all of which take place before n.
Not all temporal relations in the DRS need to be given as input because many
relations can be inferred using three kinds of knowledge:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997377636363636">
• The representation of conventional time to identify a specific period in
time; this representation relies on a structure of conventional time,
together with reasoning mechanisms to deduce temporal relations (see
Gagnon and Bras [1994] for an implementation of such a structure). For
example, from this knowledge we can deduce that September 10 must be
before September 11, which would be represented as t1 &lt; t3. Similarly, we
can deduce t2Ct1,t4 C ti, and t2 &lt;
• World knowledge about the occurrences: knowing that 02,03, and 04 are
part of 01 implies that they are all temporally included in it.
• A reasoning mechanism on the temporal relations, using a set of axioms,
such as:
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.9945715">
Vx,y(x0yVx&lt;yVy&lt;x)
Vu,v,x,y(u0xAvOyAx&lt;y uOvVu&lt;v)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99958325">
The first axiom states that for any two times, either they overlap or one
precedes the other. The second axiom states that if two other times u, v
overlap two times x, y that are in a precedence relation, either u overlaps
v, or it precedes it.
So in Figure 2, from the relations 02 0 t2, 03 0 t4, and t2 &lt; t4, we can infer
02 &lt;03 v 02 0 03. From world knowledge, we can infer that 02 and 03 cannot overlap
(leaving of Paris cannot overlap flying over Barcelona). Therefore, we conclude that

3.2 The Discourse Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995756">
To generate a text from an input such as Figure 2, we must choose a discourse structure
that segments the message into sentences.
Figure 3 illustrates one discourse representation, inspired by the Segmented Dis-
course Representation Theory (SDRT) proposed by Asher (1993), which extends DRT
by adding rhetorical relations such as those found in RST (Mann and Thompson 1987).
A discourse structure that contains the same information as in Figure 2, except that
it has been segmented, we call a Segmented Discourse Representation Structure (or
SDRS). The top-level DRS contains three small DRSs that are linked by rhetorical rela-
tions: each DRS corresponds to a sentence. In addition to these three small DRSs, the
top-level DRS contains the global text information: the description of participants and
the description of speech time. We do not yet produce this discourse structure, but
we are working on this problem, using the results of researchers who have applied
SDRT to the analysis process (Lascarides and Asher 1993; Bras and Asher 1994). In
the discourse structure of Figure 3, one sentence is elaborated by two other sentences
that constitute a narration.

The discourse structure is then translated into a semantic representation of the form
S1, S2, . . ,Sn where S, designates the ith element of a semantic representation S. Transla-
tion of the SDRS is obtained by a depth-first traversal of the DRSs it contains. For each
DRS, we establish its corresponding feature structure in the semantic representation.
Figure 4 is a semantic representation produced from the SDRS of Figure 3. Each
structure contains five features. The feature message refers to the occurrence that must
be reported by the sentence, and specifies its aspect. We distinguish, as Kamp does,
two aspects that can be used to present an occurrence: event or situation. Situations
can be open or resulting. A situation is open when the speaker/hearer is located at a
time within an occurrence. A resulting situation is the state following the termination
of an occurrence. In French, the event aspect for a past occurrence results in the use
of the passe compose (simple past in English). The mparfait and the plus-que-parfait
correspond to open and resulting situations (the closest tenses in English are the past
progressive and the past perfect). In the first two elements of Figure 4, the occurrence
is presented as an event, whereas in the last one it is presented as an open situation.
Among the four occurrences contained in the DRS, only three of them constitute the
main &amp;quot;message&amp;quot; of the text: Oj, 02, and 04.
The four other features in a structure Si give the value of four temporal markers
that express the localization of the occurrence. These markers correspond to the four
markers proposed by Kamp and Rohrer (Bras 1990) for the analysis of texts, which we
have adapted for text generation. They can be seen as an extension of Reichenbach&apos;s
markers (1947). Essentially, the values of these four features depend on two data:

Discourse representation for the first seven sentences of Discourse I.
The marker N represents the time of speech. This marker is constant in our exam-
ple, but it could be locally altered in the discourse, in indirect speech for example. We
did not study such cases, but we think that the marker N would be required to deal
with them.
Perspective point PERSP refers to an instant from which the occurrence must be
considered. Usually it is the same as the time of speech, but in some cases, such as a
flashback, it has a different value. In Discourse 1, there is one such case. The fifth and
sixth sentences (where occurrences 06 and 07 are reported) constitute a flashback: the
perspective point is the occurrence of the fourth sentence (05). In discourse structure,
the flashback is represented with a rhetorical structure. Consider for example the
discourse structure for the first seven sentences of Discourse 1 as sketched in Figure 5.
For the translation of the two DRSs containing 06 and 07, the value of PERSP will be
the occurrence 05, since the DRS containing this occurrence dominates the two others
with the relation flashback. For the next DRS, the one containing 05, the perspective
point will be reset to the value it had before entering the flashback, that is, the value
when the DRS of 06 was considered.
The value of PERSP is used for the choice of verb tense. In Discourse 1, the
flashback results in the choice of the plus-que-parfait.
LOC represents the temporal location of the occurrence reported. If this occurrence
overlaps another temporal object, this object may be used as a value for LOC. In

Figure 4, the values of LOC show that t1 and t2 are used to localize the first two
occurrences. In the third sentence, the situation corresponding to 04 is presented at
the instant where 03 takes place. If no other temporal object overlaps the one that
constitutes the message, the temporal location represented by LOC can be defined in
relation to another temporal object. We will see examples of this in the next section.
LOC represents the information to be expressed by an ATL in the sentence and does
not necessarily have a value, because a sentence may not contain an ATL.
In a text, when we want to express a succession of occurrences, we need a way
to memorize the occurrence that is used as a reference for the localization of the
next one. This is exactly the role of the marker REF. The values of REF are used to
represent the progression of time in the discourse. Each time a sentence expresses a
new temporal location (which can be an occurrence or a temporal constant), the value
of REF is updated to this new value, and the temporal localization in the following
sentence may be achieved in relation to this reference. The following rules are used
for identifying the value of REF:
I. Identify the S-antecedent, the DRS to which the current DRS is attached
in the discourse structure, and S„ the feature structure associated with
this DRS in the semantic representation.

2. If the occurrence reported as message in Sa is presented as a situation, it
cannot be used as a reference point, since a situation cannot state a
progression in time.
3. If LOC has a value that is temporally more precise than the occurrence
in the message, REF will take on its value, otherwise REF is bound to the
occurrence in the message, if this occurrence is not presented as a
situation.
4. If LOC has no value and the occurrence in the message is a situation, the
antecedent sentence does not state a progress in time. Therefore, REF
takes the same value as in Sa•
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992419578947368">
In Figure 4, the context for the first sentence is empty so no value is given to
REF. For the second and third sentences, the value of REF is the event presented in
the previous sentence. The occurrence in the third sentence is expressed as a situation,
so it cannot be the reference for the fourth sentence (not shown in the figure). Con-
sequently, REF for the fourth sentence takes the value of LOC in the structure of the
third sentence: t4. We will see in Section 5 how the value of REF is used to produce
the temporal adverb.
The choice of aspect in building the semantic structure is achieved by taking into
account pragmatic information and the interaction with other choices, such as the
type of temporal localizer. Currently, we first identify the localizer that constrains the
selection of aspect, but more study is needed to clarify their interaction.
If an occurrence is presented as a situation, the temporal localizer must be a time
included in it; but an event aspect cannot be combined with a localizer. In Figure 4,
the occurrence of S1 must be presented as an event, since the localizer t1 includes
the occurrence. In S2, the occurrence is also an event, even if the localizer overlaps
the occurrence: the overlapping relation does not prevent the existence of an inclusion
relation. If an inclusion relation between t2 and 02 could be deduced, then the situation
aspect could be chosen. In 53, the localizer is included in the occurrence of the message,
so the situation aspect is selected.

An alternative semantic representation.
The semantic representation given in Figure 4 is not unique. Figure 6 shows an-
other semantic representation built from the DRS of Figure 2. It contains a fourth
sentence. The main difference from the previous representation is that 03, instead of
acting as a localizer for 04, is the message of a sentence; t3, referring to a moment
located two hours after t2, localizes 03. Therefore, instead of the third sentence of
Discourse 1, we would obtain these two sentences:
Deux heures plus tard, il a survole Two hours later, it flew over Barcelona (6). At
Barcelone (6). A ce moment-là, le reacteur this moment, the engine was working (o&apos;4).
fonctionnait (014).
Once the semantic representation is produced, the adverbial or temporal location (ATL)
and the verb phrase (VP) can be generated independently. The syntactic form of the
verb phrase is determined by the combination of the following information:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999832333333333">
• temporal relation between localizer LOC and speech time N;
• temporal relation between localizer LOC and perspective point PERSP;
• aspect of the occurrence.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997899">
The choice of the syntactic structure of the ATL depends on the value of LOC,
which may refer to N or REF. The interaction of temporal information conveyed by
verb tense and adverbs is taken into account in the process of translation from the con-
ceptual representation to the semantic level, where the choices of aspect, perspective
point PERSP and localizer LOC are made.
We still have not entirely solved the problem of choosing among all semantic
representations that can be built from a DRS. In the current implementation of Pretexte,
we have identified a set of rules to produce the semantic representation. In particular,
these rules insure that the values of the four temporal markers are coherent with the
aspect chosen to present the occurrences. What remains to be done, essentially, is to
identify the knowledge that governs these rules causing them to select a particular
semantic representation.

3.4 Representation of Localization

<bodyText confidence="0.994456375">
We have argued in the previous section that four temporal markers are needed to
express the temporal location of an occurrence. In this section, we discuss the marker
LOC, the localizer that provides information about the location in time of the occur-
rence using another entity. The localizer is usually a temporal constant, but it can also
be another occurrence, whose approximate location in time is already known.
An ATL can convey localizers of two types: in the first type, a localizer directly
identifies the temporal zone of an occurrence using another temporal object that over-
laps it; in the second type the temporal zone of an occurrence is conveyed in relation

to another localizer. In Figure 4, all occurrences are localized directly. Occurrence 04 is
localized directly by another occurrence, whereas oi and 02 are localized directly by
a temporal constant. For S1 and S2, the values for LOC are simply constants ti and
t2. The same temporal localization can usually be expressed in many ways, and we
must also specify how these constants are worded. For example, in Discourse 1, Ti
has been translated into hier &apos;yesterday&apos; but it could also have been translated into le
10 septembre 1992 &apos;September 10th 1992&apos;, or mercredi dernier &apos;last Wednesday&apos;.
Thus, the value of LOC in the semantic representation determines the expression
of the localization, giving rise to three main problems:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991099714285714">
• how to represent the temporal constants in the conceptual representation;
• how to determine the link between these conceptual temporal constants
and their semantic representation, which specifies how they are to be
expressed in the text; and
• how to implement the selection mechanism, which relies on pragmatic
and stylistic information to choose between the many different ways of
expressing the same temporal localization.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999345727272727">
In Gagnon and Bras (1994), we gave a solution to the first two problems but the
last one still remains to be solved. Here, we discuss only the second problem: the
semantic expression of localization.
First, a few words about temporal context: usually, temporal localizers may be
understood only in reference to some time in the context. For example, in on April
15th, it is assumed that it is clear which year this time is part of. Thus, we take for
granted that all expressions of temporal localization are made in relation to such a
contextual time.
Let t, be a temporal constant, taken from the conceptual representation, which is to
be used as a localizer in the semantic representation, and -cont the contextual time. The
expression in the semantic representation is based on a term of the following form:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.56545">
[ti, Type, Naming]
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963130352941176">
The first argument is the identifier of the constant in the conceptual representation.
The second argument is the type of the temporal localizer (day, month, year, etc.). Thus,
tcont may be decomposed into times of type Type, of which t, is one. The last argument
names the time referred to by the localizer t,. There is exactly one time in the &amp;quot;real
world&amp;quot; that corresponds to the temporal constant t,. We call it objective time. We use
the notation t7 to represent the objective time that corresponds to a localizer
For example, the expression for the temporal localizer en avril &apos;in April&apos;, would be
something like this (here t67 is the corresponding temporal constant in the conceptual
representation):
[t67, month, april]
The naming april is not the syntactic word &amp;quot;April&amp;quot; but an internal keyword that
helps distinguish between the time referred to and the other months of the contextual
year.
An important distinction is made between a temporal constant t, and a objective
time t7. The constant t, pertains to the way a temporal location is expressed in the
discourse, whereas t7 can be considered the corresponding portion of time in the real
world. More than one temporal constant may correspond to a single objective time.

Suppose, for example, that the discourse contains two temporal constants, correspond-
ing to yesterday and two days after Robert&apos;s departure. We can imagine a situation where
both designate exactly the same day. But it is not possible for a single temporal con-
stant to correspond to more than one objective time. If it were, it would mean that
an ATL could be ambiguous. In our computational perspective, we accept some un-
derspecified ATLs (not precisely specifying the temporal location), but not ambiguous
ones.
A triplet is the simplest expression of a temporal localization. Usually, expressing a
temporal localization is more complex, because the temporal constant used as localizer
cannot be rendered directly in relation to the contextual time. This is the case, for
example, if the localizer is a day, and the contextual time a year, because there is
no natural way of decomposing a year into days&apos;. In these cases, we must express
relations with some intermediate localizers, until we reach one that can be related to
the contextual time.
Let [t„ T,, N1] be the localizer and [t1,T1,1\11], [tk,Tk,Nk] be intermediates localizers.
Many kinds of relations can be distinguished. They are listed in Table 1. Note that
these relations can be combined recursively. This means that the triplets used as argu-
ments may also be represented using a relation. We will show examples of this in the
following discussion.
Among the arguments of these relations, one pertains to the temporal localizer,
and one (two, in the case of the relation extent) pertains to an intermediate localizer
to which the temporal localizer is related. We call this last argument an anchor, since
it represents a time to which the relation must be &amp;quot;anchored&amp;quot; in order to deduce the
time of localization.
We will now give a short discussion of the relations of Table 1. In the follow-
ing examples, t10, designates the temporal constant corresponding to the localizer of
the occurrence, and n and t„f designate the time of speech and the reference time,
respectively.

Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic Time
The first relation is the most frequent for expressing temporal localization. It is
used to express localizations like le 3 avril &apos;on April 3rd&apos;. In this case, the localizer
could be formulated as:
inclin([hoc, day, 3], [t1, month, april])
As expected, the intermediate localizer t1 is to be interpreted in relation to the
contextual year. The semantics of a more complex localizer like le matin du 3 avril 1994
&apos;on the morning of April 3rd 1994&apos; is an example of using recursivity for the expression:
inclinGt10c, moment-of-day, morning], inclinUt1, day, 3],
inclinGt2, month, april], [t3, year, 1994])))
The second relation, incl, is required to deal with adverbials such as le jour ou Paul
est parti &apos;the day when Paul left&apos;, aujourd&apos;hui &apos;today&apos; and ce jour-la &apos;that day&apos;. All of
these refer to a day, but this day is not expressed in relation to a time that includes it.
On the contrary, the other time is included in it: the time when Paul left in the first
example, the time of speech in the second example, and the referent time associated
with REF in the third one. Suppose that in the conceptual representation, 023 is the
object representing the departure of Paul. These three examples could be represented,
respectively, as:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.533304666666667">
inclGti„, day, _], [023, -,
incl([1.10, day,_], [n, , _])
inclUtioc, day, -],[tre ,
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.950792375">
where &amp;quot;_&amp;quot; is used for arguments whose values are not relevant or unknown.
The relations begin and end represent the case where only one boundary of the
localizer is known. This results in an ATL such as depuis le 3 avril &apos;since April 3rd&apos; or
jusqu&apos;au 3 avril &apos;until April 3rd&apos; where meaning is ambiguous. What do we mean ex-
actly, when we write that t, begins at time tj? That the initial boundary of t, is included
in tj or that the ending of tj &amp;quot;meets&amp;quot; the beginning of t1? If the answer is that ti includes
the initial boundary of t,, what is the constraint on the duration of t,? It is clear that it
must be shorter than tj. We do not have any answers to these crucial questions, and
other similar ones. These are problems that pertain to the deep generation process,
which is not the focus of this paper. We think that at the level of the semantic repre-
sentation, this relation need not be further clarified, since it corresponds to the way
time is expressed in the language. In fact, all our relations have this underspecified
nature.
For the relations before and after, the value of the temporal distance is given as a
duration, using an expression of this form:
duration(N, Type)
The value of the duration is obtained by calculating the period corresponding to
N periods of type Type. For example, the adverbial deux jours apres le depart de Paul &apos;two
days after Paul&apos;s departure&apos; would be represented as (023 represents the occurrence of
Paul&apos;s departure):
afteratioc, [023, _],duration(2, day))
If the temporal distance is not known (or irrelevent), it is indicated by indefinite.
Thus, apres le depart de Paul &apos;after Paul&apos;s departure&apos; would be represented as:
afterGtioc, -, -I, [023,_, _], indefinite)

Now, let&apos;s suppose that the localizer ti is of type T. In some cases, a good way
to express it is by giving its position relative to another time tj of the same type. For
example, the ATL cinq jours plus tard &apos;five days later&apos; is not used to mean &amp;quot;at a time
in the future, five days from the reference time,&amp;quot; but rather &amp;quot;the 5th day after the one
which included the reference time.&amp;quot; If the reference time is itself a day, the semantics
of this ATL could be:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.57137525">
relpos(5, [t10, day, _], [tref, , _])
If tref is not a day, we must express the relation by taking as anchor the day which
includes it:
relpos (5, [thx, day, _], incl( [t1, day, _], {tref, day, _]))
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.962074375">
(This takes for granted that the time tref is not bigger than a day. If tref were bigger
than a day, it would not make any sense to express relative position by specifying the
temporal distance in days.)
Similarly, hier &apos;yesterday&apos; would be expressed semantically as &amp;quot;the day that is the
first one before the day that includes the time of speech&amp;quot;:
relpos (-1, [t10c, day, _], inclifiti, day, _], [n, , _]))
We have seen a way of expressing duration, by giving the length as a number
of time units. But there is another way of expressing duration: by indicating the two
boundaries of the period. By using this method, not only the duration of an occurrence
is expressed, but so is its temporal location, at least partially. The relation extent is used
to express this kind of duration. For example, the semantics of du 3 avril au 5 mai &apos;from
April 3rd to May 5th&apos; is formulated as:
extent Gt , _], inclin([t1, day, 3], [t2, month, april]), inclin([t3, day, 5], [Li, month, may]))
The semantics of du 3 au 10 avril &apos;from April 3 to 10&apos; should represent the fact that
the whole duration is included in the same month:
inclin (extent ([t1oc, -, -], [t1, day, 3], [t2, day, 10]), [t3, month, april])
The relation extent is also used to represent adverbials like depuis trois jours &apos;for
three days&apos; and pendant trois jours a partir du 3 avril &apos;during three days starting from
April 3rd&apos;. These adverbials explicitly express one of the two boundaries. In the first
example, it is either the time of speech or the reference time (the ATL means &amp;quot;for
three days until now&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;for three days until then&amp;quot;). In the second example, it is the
time corresponding to April 3rd. The other boundary is indicated implicitly by giving
a temporal distance from the anchor. The first example, supposing that the explicit
boundary is speech time, would be represented as:
extent( [t10, , _],beforeGt1, [n, , _], duration (3, day)), [n, -1)
This expresses a period whose ending is the time of speech and whose beginning must
be calculated by finding the time that is three days before speech time.
The second example would be represented as:
extent ([t1„, , _], inclinati, day, 3], [t2, month, april]), after( [t3, -, -1, [t1, duration (3, day)))
Note that in both examples, the same temporal constant represents both the explicit
boundary and the anchor of the relation after or before used to express the implicit
boundary (n and t1, respectively).

Considering the examples we have just given, one may think that recursivity
applies only to the anchor. This is not the case. The triplet that gives the location time
in the expression can be replaced by a complex expression. We have such a situation
with le 3 avril dernier &apos;the last April 3rd&apos; represented as:
relpos (-1, inclinGt10c, day, 3], [ti , month, april]), inclat2, day, _1, [n,
More precisely, this expression means &amp;quot;the April 3rd that is the first one in the
past, taking speech time as starting point.&amp;quot;
Finally, to illustrate the richness of our semantics for expressing ATLs, in Table 2
we give a list of more adverbials with their semantics. Note the extensive use of the
combination property.
Thus, to specify the localization of an occurrence, we can use another simultaneous
object, or use a localizer that is expressed in relation to another localizer. The list of
relations given in Table 1, together with the possibility of combining them, offers a very
powerful way of expressing the great diversity in the semantics of temporal localizers.
Of course, not all the combinations may be expressed naturally in the language, but
we are convinced that most of the ATLs can be expressed with this semantics.&apos;
The problem of representing temporal location has received a lot of attention in
the past (Dowty 1979, 1982, 1986; Bach 1986; Verkuyl 1989; and Vlach 1993). But these
works have focused on the aspectual structure of adverbials and their relation to tense
and aspect. We have not found any previous proposals of a recursive semantics like
ours for representing the various types of localizations.
More related to our work is Allen (1983) who proposes a set of primitive relations
to represent all possible relations between two temporal intervals. The relations defined
in Table 1 differ in many respects from the relations proposed by Allen. As mentioned
before, ours are less precise. For example, the moment represented using the relation
end in our model corresponds to three relations in Allen&apos;s model. Suppose that t7 and
are the objective times corresponding to the localizer and the anchor, respectively.
Then, in Allen&apos;s model, the end of t7 could coincide with the beginning of t7, could
coincide with the end of t, or could be included in t.
The main reason for using a different set of primitives is to represent as closely
as possible the way temporal localization is dealt with in language. The result of our

expressive. It can be shown that all of Allen&apos;s relations may be represented in our
system. For example, Allen&apos;s relation start could be represented by a combination of
begin and inclin. In other words, our set of relations and Allen&apos;s represent two different
ways of expressing the same temporal facts.
A model like Allen&apos;s seems more suitable for reasoning at a conceptual level. We
will see, in Section 5, how our semantics can be used to generate adverbials of temporal
localization. Before doing so, we must see how the generation process is implemented
in Pretexte.

4. The Surface Generation Process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987519625">
To implement the surface generation process, we adopted the theory of Systemic Func-
tional Grammar (SFG) of Halliday, described in Berry 1975, 1976; Winograd 1983;
Matthiessen and Bateman 1991), because it is based on the very nature of the genera-
tion process: a selection mechanism.
SFG, instead of treating language as a cognitive process, as in the linguistic tradi-
tion that follows from Chomsky&apos;s work, considers it a part of social interaction. This
bias results in a paradigmatic analysis of language as opposed to the more syntagmatic
analyses of the Chomskyan approach: a constituent in a sentence is compared to, or
contrasted with, other forms that could have been used. SFG is thus more focused on
semantics than on syntax. See Fawcett (1988) for a more detailed description of SFG
and its relevance for natural language generation.
The choices for an expression are represented as systems in SFG. The final structure
of a phrase is determined by a sequence of choices made by traversing a system
network. For example, the contrast between the two temporal adverbials in (1) can be
explained by the choice between direct and relative in the system DESIGNATION of
Figure 7.

These features reflect the fact that in (1a), the adverbial expresses a temporal
location directly, whereas in (lb), the localization of the period when Marie is sick is
presented indirectly, in relation to another temporal localization.

Implementation of the surface generation process in Pretexte.
To produce a sentence, the network is processed from left to right. When a system
is entered, a choice is made that may lead to another system or to a conjunction of
systems processed concurrently. The syntactic structure of the phrase results from a
set of constraints determined by features selected during the traversal of the entire
network.
The choices made in the first traversal of the network determine the overall struc-
ture of the sentence, represented as an ordered sequence of functions that must be
fulfilled. The term &amp;quot;function,&amp;quot; in this context, refers to the role played by a con-
stituent of a phrase in achieving a communicative goal (Halliday 1985). For example,
a sentence can often be decomposed into three constituents fulfilling the following
functions: Subject, Predicate, and Object.&apos;
Once the functional structure of the sentence is established, its network is traversed
again to determine the syntactic structure, which is then further refined until each
function is realized by a single word.
Figure 8 illustrates the organization of the modules in Pretexte, inspired by Nigel
(Mann 1983; Mann 1985; Matthiessen 1985; Matthiessen and Bateman 1991). To produce
a sentence, Pretexte uses three information components: the environment, containing
the information about the message and a knowledge base describing how to achieve
lexicalization; the grammar, represented as a systemic network; and the blackboard,
used to determine the syntactic structure. The engine controls the surface genera-
tion process and accesses the three information components through three interface
modules: semantic interface, interpreter and realizer. The solver determines the fi-
nal structure of the constituent, using constraints posted in the blackboard during the
traversal of the network.

The engine starts by posting on the blackboard the description of the realized con-
stituent representing the sentence. It then activates the traversal of the network by the
interpreter. To select a feature in a system, the interpreter transmits inquiries to the
engine. If the information necessary to respond to the inquiry is in the environment,
the engine transmits the inquiry to the semantic interface. If an inquiry is about a
decision previously made in the surface generation process (for example, a question
about what features have been selected in a system visited earlier), then the engine
transmits the inquiry to the realizer.
Answers to inquiries enable the selection of a feature in the visited system. The
interpreter then extracts a set of realization statements associated with the selected
feature. After the execution of these statements by the realizer, the information about
the structure of the realized constituent, contained in the blackboard, is updated. Three
kinds of action may be executed by the realizer:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.923477">
• addition of a new constituent with the appropriate semantic information
fulfilling a specific function;
• updating of the information pertaining to one constituent;
• addition of partial ordering constraints that identify the sequence of
functions composing the final structure.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999817">
This process goes on until no more system can be visited. The solver then solves
the ordering constraints on the blackboard. We thus obtain a sequence of functions
that constitutes the final structure of the realized constituent. Each of these functions
is associated with semantic information extracted from the environment. For example,
the sentence may contain the function Temp_loc (temporal localizer), whose semantic
information will be the expression associated with the temporal marker LOC in the
input. If a function is to be lexicalized as a word, the lexicon is consulted to identify
the word, taking into account the features selected during the traversal. Otherwise the
grammar is re-entered using the function as the new realized constituent with some
features preselected. For example, to generate the sentence in 2:

where 010 must be expressed as an event and 1-11 is a period terminating at 10:50. The
event 010 is before the time of speech and it coincides more or less with the time used
as localizer. The first traversal of the grammar determines the overall structure of the
sentence made of the four functions at the top of Figure 9. As none of them may be
lexicalized directly as a word, they must be realized by re-entering the grammar.
We describe only the realization of the function Temploc. The semantics associ-
ated with Temploc is the value of LOC in the semantic representation. Traversal of
the network for the realization of Temploc results in a structure with two functions:
the Positioner and the Reference Zone. The first function is lexicalized with the prepo-
sition jusque; for the second function, the grammar is re-entered, taking as semantics
the anchor of the expression associated with Temploc: inclinat6,minute,501,114,hour,101).
Again, this results in a structure with two functions; in this case, both functions can
be lexicalized, ending the realization of the function Temploc. The same kind of pro-
cessing is done for the other functions in the sentence.

Unfortunately, the combination of localizers in the semantics does not always
correspond to the combination of adverbials. For example, if there were such a corre-
spondence, the adverbial in (1) would be something like le jour avant le jour qui contient
l&apos;instant d&apos;enonciation &apos;the day before the day that contains the time of speech&apos;. Instead,
we get the simple adverbial hier &apos;yesterday&apos;. For complex semantic expressions, in all
examples except (15), (16) and (18), there is one embedded adverbial corresponding to
each anchor. For example, the anchor relpos(1,112,month4, inclat3,month-1, 1-tref in
(12) corresponds to le mois suivant &apos;the following month&apos; in the adverbia1.5 Examples
(1-5) are special, since the relation and the anchor are combined in the same syntactic
structure. In (15), direct translation of the anchor into an adverbial would produce
trois lours apres ce moment-la &apos;three days after that moment&apos;, and in (18), pendant trois
lours jusqu&apos;a ce moment-la &apos;during three days until that moment&apos;.

forms, which one should be used in the grammar to distinguish among ATLs? We
have chosen the semantic form because adverbials are distinguished not only by the
number of anchors but also by their nature. Examples (4) and (5) are both syntactically
simple—the anchor in the semantic form is not expressed—but it is the anchor that
explains their difference: the first uses speech time, whereas the second uses reference
time.
Figure 10 illustrates the part of the network taking into account the combination
property. We first identify the number of anchors. If there is only one, the feature unique
is selected in the system QTY_ANCHORS. Otherwise, double is selected. Then, for each
anchor, we must establish if it is deictic, anaphoric, or autonomous. If the localization
represented by the anchor is made in relation to the time of speech, deictic is selected;
if the localization is made in relation to the reference time, anaphoric is selected; if
the anchor achieves a localization without using either of the two temporal markers,
autonomous is selected. In Table 4, we indicate the features selected in the systems of
Figure 10, for the production of the adverbials given in Table 3.
Some adverbials may be distinguished using the systems of Figure 10, but Table 4
shows that these systems are not enough. The features have a strong influence on the
most embedded adverbials. For example, in (11), the selection of deictic results in cette
semaine &apos;this week&apos; for the most embedded adverbial but if the feature anaphoric had
been selected, it would have produced cette semaine-la &apos;that week&apos;.
These features alone do not explain the recursive form of adverbials. Figure 11
shows the structure of two adverbials from Table 3. The structure of adverbial (11) is
given in (a). It has three levels, each one corresponding to one adverbial. The simple
structure of adverbial (4) is shown in (b). Their difference is not only due to the number
of levels in the structure. In (a), the structure contains a function, the Positioner, that
expresses the relation to the anchor; there is no function in (b). Sometimes an anchor
is not realized syntactically at all. In Figure 12, we consider (13) and (15): the anchor
is expressed in (13), shown in (a), but not in (15), shown in (b). The structure of (15)
contains the Positioner and a function conveying the temporal distance to an implicit
anchor.
These examples show that features are not sufficient; to determine the syntactic
structure of the adverbial, we need more systems in our grammar, such as the network
of Figure 7. The two networks of Figure 7 and Figure 10 must be traversed in parallel.

adverbials (14) and (15): trois jours &apos;three days&apos;. Thus, (14) contains both functions and
(15) contains only the Temporal Distance. Adverbial (16) is distinguished from (14)
and (15) because it contains neither of these functions.
In dans trois jours &apos;in three days from now&apos; and apres le 9 octobre &apos;after October 9th&apos;,
we find two different structures. The elements of the first structure are exactly the
same as the structure of adverbial (15), but they occur in a different order: Temporal
Distance comes before the Positioner. In the second structure, there is a Temporal
Reference Zone, le 9 octobre, but no Temporal Distance. Thus, for punctual adverbials,
there are five possible structures, illustrated in Figure 12. To distinguish between these
adverbials, we use a network, part of which is shown in Figure 13.
Two features are expressed by the system RELATION TYPE: before and after. To
realize the Positioner, there is no need to re-enter the grammar, since it may be found
directly in the lexicon. The lexical choice depends not only on the selection achieved

in RELATION TYPE, but also in the choice made in the system ANCHOR of figure 10.
For example, in the cases where after is chosen, the Positioner could be lexicalized as
puis &apos;then&apos; or plus tard &apos;later&apos;; if anaphoric is chosen in ANCHOR it can be lexicalized
as dans &apos;in&apos; if deictic is chosen or apres &apos;after&apos; if autonomous is chosen.
The fact that Temporal Distance and Temporal Reference Zone are optional in the
structure is represented in the grammar by two parallel systems: REFERENCE ZONE
and TEMPORAL DISTANCE. If, in REFERENCE ZONE, explicit is chosen, the function
Temporal Reference Zone is included in the structure. Since this function represents
another localizer, the anchor, it is realized by re-entering the grammar, taking as input
the semantic representation of this anchor. In TEMPORAL DISTANCE, the selection
of definite results in the inclusion of the function Temporal Distance. To realize it,
the grammar must be re-entered, and some features must be preselected so that it is
realized as a noun phrase.
Table 6 lists all possible adverbials represented by the network of Figure 13 to-
gether with their selected features. The three adverbials taken from Table 3 are pre-
ceded by their reference number to ease the comparison of their semantics with the
selected features; their relations will be discussed later.
The distinction between structures (b) and (c) in Figure 12 is not explained by
the grammar section shown in Figure 13, since the same features are selected for trois
jours plus tard and dans trois jours. However, structure (b) in Figure 12 is found only
for deictic localizers. Therefore, features for deictic localizers selected in the system
ANCHOR, will distinguish structure (b) from structure (c).
Let us now see how the features are selected for the production of relational
punctual localizers. In RELATION TYPE, the feature reflects the relation used in the
semantics, if this relation is before or after. Adverbial (14) deserves some explanation.
Since its semantic expression uses the relation relpos, we would expect its syntactic
realization to be: le troisieme jour apres le jour du depart de Robert &apos;the third day after the
day of Robert&apos;s departure&apos;, but this usage is rare. Instead we find trois jours apres le
depart de Robert &apos;three days after Robert&apos;s departure&apos;, which is what we would expect if
the semantic expression used the relation after. This seems to be because if the temporal
distance is one unit, a direct localizer is preferred. So, instead of generating un mois
plus tard &apos;one month later&apos;, we produce le mois suivant &apos;the next month&apos;. Our intuition

is that when X is &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; we have this equivalence:
relpos(X, [t„ T1, N1, Z) == af ter ([t, T1, Z, duration(X, T,))
and similarly for X negative and the relation before. More study is needed to determine
the threshold at which the two relations become equivalent in the linguistic realization.
We are sure that for X = 1 or X = —1, they are not equivalent, so in our implementation,
we use 2 and —2 as thresholds.
In the system REFERENCE ZONE, the feature implicit is chosen if the anchor is
a simple localizer using the reference time or the time of speech, otherwise explicit is
chosen. Feature selection in TEMPORAL DISTANCE depends on whether the third
argument in the semantic expression is indefinite or a specified duration.
5.2.2 Durative Adverbials. We now show how the durative adverbials of Table 5 can
be differentiated. The part of the network that generates these adverbials is shown
in Figure 14. We give the three kinds of structure identified for these adverbials in
Figure 15, and, finally, in Table 7 we list the durative adverbials of Table 5 with their
corresponding features according to the systems of Figure 14. To give a complete
illustration of all adverbials generated with the network of Figure 14, we added one
adverbial to the list: pendant trois jours &apos;for three days from now&apos;, which is symmetrical
to depuis trois jours &apos;for three days until now&apos;.
In Figure 14, we distinguish two types of durative adverbial phrases: bound, if
the duration is expressed by specifying one or two of its boundaries; and quantified,

if the duration is expressed as a quantity of time units. In the first case, we get a
structure such as (b) or (c) in Figure 15. In (b) there is only one boundary, and the
Positioner indicates which one is used: its lexicalization depends on the feature selected
in DURATION ANCHOR. If anterior is selected, one further distinction is required to
lexicalize the Positioner, as represented by the system DURATION PERSPECTIVE. The
Positioner is realized by the phrase a partir de if the feature chosen is external, otherwise
it is realized as depuis. The choice depends on the aspect of the occurrence reported:
the feature external is chosen if the occurrence is presented as an event, and internal is
chosen if the occurrence is presented as a situation. These two cases are exemplified
in the following two sentences:

In (3a), since the occurrence is presented as an event, the feature external is selected
during the determination of the ATL, thus resulting in the form a partir de 1972 &apos;from
1972&apos;. In (3b), the same occurrence is presented as a situation considered from the
reference time. Thus, internal is selected, resulting in the form depuis 1972 &apos;since 1972&apos;.
This is a good example of the interaction of ATLs with the aspect of the occurrence.
In the interpretation of the ATL in (3b), the duration is anchored not only on
the year 1972 but also on the reference time included in the occurrence. But in the
semantics of the ATL, which uses the relation begin, as well as ATL (12) in Table 3,
there is only one anchor. Even if the reference time is involved in the understanding
of the whole sentence, it is not directly expressed in the semantics of the ATL.
An alternative would be to express the same localization using the relation extent,
as in (18) of Table 3. If the reference time is included in 1982 (the beginning of the
duration expressed in (3b) thus being 10 years before), the semantics would be:

In depuis dix ans &apos;For 10 years&apos;, the meaning of the ATL, which is &amp;quot;since 10 years
in the past starting from this moment&amp;quot; requires the use of the reference time.
If, in the system DURATION ANCHOR, the feature double is chosen, we get a
structure containing two boundaries, as in (c) in Figure 15. A boundary, in the structure
of a bound localizer, is always realized as a temporal adverbial, by re-entering the
grammar.
When the feature quantified is selected, the structure in (a) of Figure 15 is obtained.
To realize the Positioner in this case, another system is required, because the quantity
of time that constitutes the duration can be worded in many ways. We can express
the duration of the occurrence without giving any hint about its location in time, as
in durant trois jours &apos;during three days&apos;, or we can indicate a duration that begins or
ends at some time.
To see how the features are selected in the grammar section of Figure 14, compare
the adverbials of Table 7 with their semantics as given in Table 3 (the semantics for
pendant trois jours is the same as depuis trois jours, but the relation after is substituted
before and the two anchors are reversed). First, the feature bound in DURATION TYPE
is selected if the relation used in the semantic representation is either begin or end, or
if it is extent and the two anchors are autonomous. In DURATION ANCHOR, features
corresponding to these three cases are selected. In DURATION PERSPECTIVE, the
selection depends on the aspect of the occurrence reported in the sentence.
In DURATION TYPE, quantified is selected if the semantics uses the relation extent
and one anchor is deictic or anaphoric, as in our examples, or if it uses the relation
duration. In the first case, the selection depends on the position of the anaphoric or
deictic anchor in the expression. If the relation duration is used, since there is no anchor,
the feature nil is selected in the next system.

5.3 Direct Localizers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999520333333333">
We complete our discussion of adverbials by explaining how the direct localizers can be
differentiated. Figure 16 shows the structure of the direct adverbials that constitute the
first half of Table 5; there are three possible structures for a direct localizer. The simplest
ones, in (a) and (b), contain only one function, Zone Designator, that expresses the
temporal location zone designated by the adverbial. This function is realized directly
by an adverb, in (a), using the lexicon depending on the system ANCHOR of Figure 10.
In (b), the grammar must be re-entered to generate a nominal phrase whose form also
depends on the choice in ANCHOR.
In some cases, it is not sufficient to specify a temporal location zone: we must also
add what we call a Pointer to relate the occurrence with this zone. In our examples,
the Pointer indicates that the occurrence takes place during the month of April, or when
Robert left. The existence of such a localizer in the structure seems to depend on the
level of the adverbial in the embedding structure. For example, we find a Pointer in
the adverbial a 8h00 &apos;at 8:00&apos; if it is used alone, but not if it is embedded in another
adverbial, like depuis 8h00 &apos;since 8:00&apos;. Our approach to this problem may be contrasted
with Forster&apos;s (1989), who determines the realization of the Pointer by the temporal
aspect of the Zone Designator (durative or punctual) using a constraint propagation
technique.
Other possible structures for direct localizers are illustrated in (d) and (e) in Fig-
ure 16. One function is the Zone Designator, which designates the direct expression
of temporal zone. If this zone is included in another localizer or in a position relative
to another localizer, we must include another function in the structure: the Reference
Zone, which corresponds to this second localizer. The Attributor links these two func-
tions. In (e), le matin du 3 avri11995 &apos;the morning of April 3rd 1995&apos; directly expresses

a morning. This morning is itself part of another localizer, and so on. The Attributor
is sometimes lexicalized as an empty item.
To these direct localizers, we must add the embedded direct adverbials found
in the relational adverbials of table 5. In Figure 17, we use by dashed-line boxes to
indicate those that differ from Figure 16.
The system shown in Figure 18 differentiates among these different forms of direct
adverbials. For occurrential adverbials, for example, the second adverbial of (b) in
Figure 16 and the embedded adverbials in (d) in Figure 16 and (b) in Figure 17, the
occurrence may be nominalized or not. We do not have any satisfying answers to the
question of how to choose between these two possibilities. We will state only that
when the adverbial is embedded, a nominalized form may be preferred to another
embedded adverbial.
For chronological adverbials, the system AUTONOMOUS ZONE distinguishes
between those that have an anaphoric or deictic temporal location zone, and those for
which the temporal location zone is autonomous. Adverbials of the first type always
have a simple structure: aujourd&apos;hui, hier, demain, ce mois-ci, ce mots-la, cette semaine, le
mois suivant. The temporal location zone is different from the anchor. In mercredi de cette
semaine &apos;Wednesday of this week&apos;, the temporal location zone, expressed by mercredi,
is autonomous whereas the anchor expressed by cette semaine is deictic. When the
network is traversed the first time, yes is selected in the system AUTONOMOUS
ZONE. Its only in the second traversal, when cette semaine is generated, that no is
selected in this system.
We must further distinguish adverbials with an autonomous temporal location
zone, by deciding if their structure contains a Reference Zone or not. The feature

5.4 Related Work on the Generation of ATLs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958192307693">
The problem of temporal localization has already been studied by many researchers,
but most of them have focused on the aspectual interaction of the adverbials with
verb tense; the problem of the semantic and syntactic structures of ATLs has been
neglected. Molines&apos; (1990) study from a linguistic perspective characterizes the ad-
verbials based on noun phrases. Our work extends hers because our computational
perspective has made us go farther in the formalization. Bras and Molines (1993)
made a similar attempt, but from the perspective of discourse understanding. Since
the problems of understanding are very different from the problems of generation, we
could not simply use their method in a &amp;quot;reversed mode.&amp;quot; Their method relies on a
compositional analysis of the language, where all information units extracted from the
semantic structure are combined to select one meaning for the adverbial. This compo-
sitional approach is not easily reversible, and it does not provide any insight into the
selection problem inherent to the generation task. Ehrich (1987) classifies adverbials in
the context of generation, but she does not cover all the cases presented in this section.
Concerning the problem of the generation of ATLs, Maybury (1991) shows how the
notion of focus as used by McKeown (1985) can be extended to include a temporal
focus that corresponds essentially to the reference point in the Reichenbach model
(1947). An operation on the temporal focus, in combination with the value of speech
and event times, selects the temporal adverbial and the verb tense. Since the emphasis
in this work was on the planning aspect of the task, the variety of adverbials that can
be generated is limited.
Forster (1989) explains how the syntactic structure of a temporal adverbial may be
controlled by semantic information such as the durative or punctual nature of the lo-
calizer. Essentially, the final structure is obtained by propagating constraints associated
with each syntactic subpart of the structure. In particular, he focuses on the interaction
between prepositional phrases and noun phrases. For example, the preposition on is

<bodyText confidence="0.999663777777778">
selected in on Sunday because Sunday is identified as a punctual localizer; this rules out
in, which implies a durative localizer. We have already presented one problem with
this approach: it is not clear how the choice of these prepositions can be achieved by
propagating semantic constraints. The choice of preposition in French is very different
from English and it often appears to be arbitrary or conventional. Furthermore, many
aspects of the problem are neglected, such as the type of reference expressed by the
adverbial: it is not clear how Forster&apos;s system can represent the distinctions between
anaphoric, deictic and autonomous localizers because the link between the semantic
and syntactic levels is not fully explained.
Nigel (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991) offers the widest coverage of English but
the variety of forms for ATLs is quite limited. The temporal localization that may be
expressed by different types of syntactic structures is represented in Nigel by systems
dispersed throughout the whole grammar network. For the expression of temporal
localizers, their grammar is more dependent on the syntactic structure than ours,
which is mainly determined by the semantics.
To summarize, our approach departs from previous approaches by covering more
types of adverbials, by proposing a semantics for localization, and by explaining in
detail how the different syntactic structures may be obtained from this semantics.

6. The Production of Verb Phrases
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988933333333">
In our work, we have focused on the generation of adverbials because we felt this
problem had not received enough attention and because the temporal localization
achieved by ATLs is more complex and more diversified than that expressed by verb
tenses. To generate a discourse like Discourse 1, however, we cannot avoid the problem
of determining the structure of the verb phrase, because part of the localization is
achieved by the verb, and because of the relations between verbs and adverbials.
In our implemention of the expression of temporal localization, the relation be-
tween the verb and the adverbial is taken into account mainly in the deep generation
process. In the semantic representation, we find traces of this interaction. By keeping
these decisions in the deep generation process, the verb phrase and the ATL can be
generated independently.
Our method for generating the verb phrase takes advantage of the kind of in-
formation directly represented in DRT: the relation of the occurrence to speech time,
which we call the primary localization, the aspect of the occurrence, and the presence
or absence of a perspective point. It is implemented by the grammar section illustrated
in Figure 19. In Pretexte, the production of verb phrases requires many traversals of
the network. First, when the structure of the sentence is determined, choices are made
regarding localization, aspect, and perspective. After a first traversal of the network,
the sentence&apos;s structure contains a function called Predicate, realized as a verb phrase.
The grammar must be re-entered to realize the Predicate. The systems visited during
this second traversal (not shown here) classify verb tenses in French. Most of the se-
lections during this second traversal were preselected during the first traversal. For
each verb tense, there is one associated structure, which contains a main verb and one
or two auxiliaries. To generate each verb or auxiliary, another traversal is needed.
In the first system of Figure 19, PRIMARY LOC, the selection depends on the
temporal relation between the localized occurrence and the speech time. The features
of the systems ASPECT and SIT TYPE reflect the value of aspect in the semantic rep-
resentation. If the aspect is event, the system PERSPECTIVE determines if this event is
presented using a perspective. If there is one, another choice must be made regarding
its type.

Table 9 shows examples of verb phrases, including the list of features selected
for each example during the two traversals. The same tense can be used for different
feature patterns. This is the case with the imparfait and the plus-que-parfait: the impar-
fait expresses an open situation or an anterior perspective, while the plus-que-parfait
presents a resulting situation or a posterior perspective. This may be a problem in
an understanding process, since it is a source of ambiguity, but not in a generation
process since it does not matter if two different inputs map into the same syntactic
structure.
More than one verb tense may be used for the same features. This means that
our grammar is not complete: more systems would be needed to distinguish among
these different cases. For example, to distinguish the two tenses used with the first
feature pattern of Table 9, we would have to augment the grammar section of Figure 19
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994859">
123
</page>
<note confidence="0.690948">

<bodyText confidence="0.999948828571429">
to determine if the verb phrase is part of a temporal adverbial or not. For the two
cases in the third feature pattern, the difference relates to the use of indirect discourse.
Here, not only would the grammar have to be modified, but so would the semantic
representation, to take into account indirect speech. In Discourse 1, this problem is not
apparent: all verb tenses used are distinguished in our grammar because we limited
ourselves to a subset of the data.
Thus, the production of VP is more complex than what we have implemented and
we have not completely identified all the rules for the selection of verb tense: indirect
discourse is not implemented and we have not identified how modal information can
be used to select forms such as the subjunctive and the conditional. But our approach
is a good start and it could be extended by adding more systems and their selection
rules, without changing the overall structure of the network.
We can see from the approximate translations given in Table 9 that the systems
for generating French and English verb tenses differ greatly. For English verb tenses,
the method implemented in Nigel resorts to a recursive semantics involving temporal
markers, as proposed by Halliday (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991). The purpose in
this approach is to deal correctly with complex structures, such as will have been eating.
Put simply, the idea is that each auxiliary reflects a relation between two temporal
markers. This suggests a network that displays a recursive process. Thus, the phrase
will have been going to eat would be represented semantically as to eat at a time that is in
the future relative to another time that is in the past relative to a time that is in the future relative
to speech time.
This method may be adequate for English, since it seems to capture the recursive
structure of verb tenses; but in French, this recursive structure is not found. Fur-
thermore, nothing is said about how a deep generation process could produce the
corresponding semantic structure with the intermediate temporal markers. In fact, we
are not convinced that this could be easily done. Rather, we think that it is the overall
structure that is selected for a particular usage.
This completes our brief description of the generation of verb tenses. We have
not completely solved the problem. In particular, we have chosen to put most of the
problems pertaining to verb tense in the deep generation process, in order to facilitate
their generation at the surface level. This approach greatly simplifies the process and
our grammar could be easily completed to encompass all cases. Once the semantic
demands are better understood, it should be easier to solve the problem of deep
generation.

7. Conclusion and Future Work

<bodyText confidence="0.9998071">
In this paper, we have presented a method that has been successfully used to produce
text conveying temporal information. Our method combines the principles of two
theories: Kamp&apos;s Discourse Representation Theory, which guides the expression of
temporal information, and Halliday&apos;s Systemic Functional Grammar, which provides
a generation process controlled by a set of semantic choices, with the syntactic form
resulting from these choices. We argued for the use of a conceptual structure, a Dis-
course Representation Structure, combined with rhetorical principles and pragmatic
information, and for its translation into a semantic structure that is easily realized syn-
tactically. The deep generation process is hard to implement, mainly because of the
difficulty in formalizing this information. Since we assume that the deep generation

process requires a good understanding of the syntactic mechanisms, we decided to
focus on the surface generation process.
The most innovative part of our work is the generation of adverbials of temporal
location (ATLs). Our work departs from previous work in many aspects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984293571428571">
• We cover a large variety of ATLs, much larger than in any previous
generator.
• We propose a clear semantics of localization reflecting the structure of
possible ATLs. Our semantics is compatible with DRT, a theory that has
shown its usefulness in dealing with localization in discourse analysis.
• We propose an implemented method for producing the ATLs using this
semantics.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950805555556">
For verb tense, our system is less powerful, but considered in combination with
our method for generating ATLs, we have a system that can generate a text with
an account of localization that goes farther than any previous system. In particular,
our system, programmed in Prolog, has many advantages compared to other Sys-
temic Grammar interpreters, such as Nigel. The syntax of the grammar is easy to
read because we implemented the selection mechanism as a set of Prolog rules, which
are more natural than the decision trees used in Nigel. Pretexte&apos;s engine is small,
thus easy to understand. In short, Pretexte is a generator that could, and probably
should, be extended but nevertheless can be used with other grammars. At this mo-
ment, the implemented grammar contains about 70 systems and produces a text such
as Discourse 1 in less than five seconds. Our approach still has to be tested in real
applications; any comparison with Nigel must be made with care, since the size of
our grammar is small. We are confident that it could be enlarged without too much
difficulty, but this remains to be implemented experimentally.
In this paper, we have shown how to generate the syntactic structures expressing
temporal localization, starting from the semantic level. To justify the choices made in
the formalization of the semantic representation, we thought it necessary to discuss the
conceptual level. Our work is the first attempt to use DRT as a starting point for im-
plementing a generation process. Since the deep generation process is not completely
identified, we cannot at this moment state that the DRT is well-suited for generation.
Still, we think that most of the issues associated with the whole process have been
discussed.
In the future, the grammar will be extended to cover more types of ATLs and
VPs. For example, ATLs referring to multiple instants, such as tous les lundis &apos;every
Monday&apos;, and VP forms expressing modality, such as conditional and subjunctive
forms, would have to be covered. The problem of negation should also be considered.
Other languages, such as English, differ significantly from French, in regard to the
production of ATLs, so a cross-linguistic exploration should be done within our model.
We think that the semantics developed, and the first systems of the grammar that
directly reflect this semantics, would remain unchanged, since we specifically defined
a formal representation abstracted from the syntactic form.
The hardest task left to tackle is the deep generation process, to determine how
one semantic representation is chosen from among those that can be built from a
conceptual representation. To implement such a process, we will have to establish a
method for constructing the semantic representation and for identifying the constraints
on this mechanism.

The problem of indirect speech should also be addressed because it has conse-
quences on surface generation, where the selection mechanism of verb tenses must be
adapted, and on deep generation, where the appropriate temporal markers must be
found. Furthermore, this problem forces us to deal with the representation of possible
(or potential) worlds.

DRT is used to represent temporal information and an intermediate semantic level for the temporal localization expressed by temporal adverbial phrases and verb phrases. This representation is then translated into a syntactic form using Systemic Grammar Theory. We have implemented this method in a working prototype called Pretexte.</abstract>

The fact that an occurrence takes place at a certain time is expressed by an overlapping relation between this occurrence and the object representing this time. The deep generation process is decomposed into two steps. In the first step, the conceptual representation is segmented and structured to build a discourse representation. In our discourse representation, which uses Segmented Discourse Representa93 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1 tion Theory (SDRT) (Asher 1993), the information is cut into smaller segments each of which contains the information to be expressed by a single sentence. The structure linking these segments relies on a set of rhetorical relations. In the second step of the deep generation process, the discourse representation is traversed and, for each segment, rules are applied to identify the feature values needed to translate it into a sentence. We thus obtain a linear structure in which each element is a set of features that determine the syntactic form of the sentence. In the surface generation process, the information in the semanti</context>

So in Figure 2, from the relations 02 0 t2, 03 0 t4, and t2 &lt; t4, we can infer 02 &lt;03 v 02 0 03. From world knowledge, we can infer that 02 and 03 cannot overlap (leaving of Paris cannot overlap flying over Barcelona). Therefore, we conclude that 02 &lt;03. 3.2 The Discourse Representation To generate a text from an input such as Figure 2, we must choose a discourse structure that segments the message into sentences. Figure 3 illustrates one discourse representation, inspired by the Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) proposed by Asher (1993), which extends DRT by adding rhetorical relations such as those found in RST (Mann and Thompson 1987). A discourse structure that contains the same information as in Figure 2, except that it has been segmented, we call a Segmented Discourse Representation Structure (or SDRS). The top-level DRS contains three small DRSs that are linked by rhetorical relations: each DRS corresponds to a sentence. In addition to these three small DRSs, the top-level DRS contains the global text information: the description of participants and the description of speech time.

In other words, our set of relations and Allen&apos;s represent two different ways of expressing the same temporal facts. A model like Allen&apos;s seems more suitable for reasoning at a conceptual level. We will see, in Section 5, how our semantics can be used to generate adverbials of temporal localization. Before doing so, we must see how the generation process is implemented in Pretexte. 4. The Surface Generation Process To implement the surface generation process, we adopted the theory of Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) of Halliday, described in Berry 1975, 1976; Winograd 1983; Matthiessen and Bateman 1991), because it is based on the very nature of the generation process: a selection mechanism. SFG, instead of treating language as a cognitive process, as in the linguistic tradition that follows from Chomsky&apos;s work, considers it a part of social interaction. This bias results in a paradigmatic analysis of language as opposed to the more syntagmatic analyses of the Chomskyan approach: a constituent in a sentence is compared to, or contrasted with, other forms that could have been used. SFG is thus more focused on semantics than on syntax. See Fa</context>

There is no simple or direct mapping between conceptual time, as it is perceived in the real world, and linguistic time, which refers to the way time is formulated in language. There may be different ways to present the same temporal concept in a text, and a single linguistic marker can be used to convey different temporal meanings. For example, the discourse below (Discourse 1) is a text generated by Pretexte, a system we developed for implementing the expression of temporal localization in French textsl. It is a slightly modified version of an example used by Bras (1990) for the extraction of temporal information in text analysis. The sentences report occurrences that are facts taking place in time. We have inserted labels in parentheses to distinguish the twelve occurrences reported in the text. Hier l&apos;avion a effectue un vol (a1). A 8h00 il a quitte Paris (02).

As we were not really successful in integrating the expression of time in French into the text-generation process, we decided to pursue our research with a different perspective. We designed a system covering many of the possibilities of expressing time in French, our hypothesis being that the achievement of this task would facilitate the design of a text-planning process. We believed it would be easier to organize the structure of the discourse with a better understanding of the way temporal information can be expressed by adverbs and verb tenses.

For further discussion of the advantages of taking occurrences as primitives, see (Bras 1990; Kamp 1979, 1981). In the conceptual representation, we find four types of information: • the description of occurrences; • the description of participants in the occurrences; • the description of temporal localizers, which are called temporal constants (they usually refer to time periods of the calendar); • temporal relations between occurrences and temporal localizers: — The relation &lt; represents temporal precedence. _ The overlap relation 0 indicates that two temporal objects are somehow simultaneous.

The four other features in a structure Si give the value of four temporal markers that express the localization of the occurrence. These markers correspond to the four markers proposed by Kamp and Rohrer (Bras 1990) for the analysis of texts, which we have adapted for text generation. They can be seen as an extension of Reichenbach&apos;s markers (1947).

Bras and Molines (1993) made a similar attempt, but from the perspective of discourse understanding. Since the problems of understanding are very different from the problems of generation, we could not simply use their method in a &amp;quot;reversed mode.&amp;quot; Their method relies on a compositional analysis of the language, where all information units extracted from the semantic structure are combined to select one meaning for the adverbial. This compositional approach is not easily reversible, and it does not provide any insight into the selection problem inherent to the generation task. Ehrich (1987) classifies adverbials in the context of generation, but she does not cover all the cases presented in this section. Concerning the problem of the generation of ATLs, Maybury (1991) shows how the notion of focus as used by McKeown (1985) can be extended to include a temporal focus that corresponds essentially to the reference point in the Reichenbach model (1947).

SFG, instead of treating language as a cognitive process, as in the linguistic tradition that follows from Chomsky&apos;s work, considers it a part of social interaction. This bias results in a paradigmatic analysis of language as opposed to the more syntagmatic analyses of the Chomskyan approach: a constituent in a sentence is compared to, or contrasted with, other forms that could have been used. SFG is thus more focused on semantics than on syntax. See Fawcett (1988) for a more detailed description of SFG and its relevance for natural language generation. The choices for an expression are represented as systems in SFG. The final structure of a phrase is determined by a sequence of choices made by traversing a system network. For example, the contrast between the two temporal adverbials in (1) can be explained by the choice between direct and relative in the system DESIGNATION of Figure 7. (1) a.

An operation on the temporal focus, in combination with the value of speech and event times, selects the temporal adverbial and the verb tense. Since the emphasis in this work was on the planning aspect of the task, the variety of adverbials that can be generated is limited. Forster (1989) explains how the syntactic structure of a temporal adverbial may be controlled by semantic information such as the durative or punctual nature of the localizer. Essentially, the final structure is obtained by propagating constraints associated with each syntactic subpart of the structure. In particular, he focuses on the interaction between prepositional phrases and noun phrases. For example, the preposition on is 121 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1 selected in on Sunday because Sunday is identified as a punctual localizer; this rules out in, which implies a durative localizer. </context>

No text generator has yet been developed to solve the problem of the expression of time. The ones that have tackled this problem have focused on the production of verb tenses, without solving the choice of temporal adverbs. The work presented in this paper addresses the problem of generating the elements that convey temporal localization in French, including both verbs and temporal adverbs. In a previous paper (Gagnon and Lapalme 1992), we proposed a method of integrating the expression of temporal concepts into the text-generation process. In particular, we showed how to produce different types of text in French from a single representation of events.

Figure 2 shows the part of the DRS used to generate the first three sentences of Discourse 1. It contains five temporal constants: n, t1, t2, t3 and t4. It is not clear how 95 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1 these temporal constants are to be described in DRT, so we have proposed elsewhere a formalization of the type of objects designated by these constants (Gagnon and Bras 1994). In this article, we give only an English description of them: n represents speech time, which, in Figure 2, is included in the time represented by t3 (September 111992). Four occurrences are represented: 01, 02, 03, and 04, all of which take place before n. Not all temporal relations in the DRS need to be given as input because many relations can be inferred using three kinds of knowledge: • The representation of conventional time to identify a specific period in time; this representation relies on a structure of conventional time, together with reasoning mechanisms to deduce temporal relati</context>

Thus, the value of LOC in the semantic representation determines the expression of the localization, giving rise to three main problems: • how to represent the temporal constants in the conceptual representation; • how to determine the link between these conceptual temporal constants and their semantic representation, which specifies how they are to be expressed in the text; and • how to implement the selection mechanism, which relies on pragmatic and stylistic information to choose between the many different ways of expressing the same temporal localization. In Gagnon and Bras (1994), we gave a solution to the first two problems but the last one still remains to be solved. Here, we discuss only the second problem: the semantic expression of localization. First, a few words about temporal context: usually, temporal localizers may be understood only in reference to some time in the context. For example, in on April 15th, it is assumed that it is clear which year this time is part of. Thus, we take for granted that all expressions of temporal localization are made in relation to such a contextual time.

The term &amp;quot;function,&amp;quot; in this context, refers to the role played by a constituent of a phrase in achieving a communicative goal (Halliday 1985). For example, a sentence can often be decomposed into three constituents fulfilling the following functions: Subject, Predicate, and Object.&apos; Once the functional structure of the sentence is established, its network is traversed again to determine the syntactic structure, which is then further refined until each function is realized by a single word.

We started from the work of Bras (1990), who proposes a method of extracting the temporal structure of a text, according to Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981), that relies on an analysis of adverbials of temporal location made by Molines (1990). To implement the production of ATLs and verb tenses, we have chosen Systemic Grammar (Halliday 1985; Berry 1975, 1976), which formulates the syntactic structure of a sentence as the result of a sequence of semantic choices. We developed a grammar interpreter inspired by Nigel (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991), but departing from it in many respects; in particular, our representation of the production of verb tenses and adverbs is quite different.

In other words, our set of relations and Allen&apos;s represent two different ways of expressing the same temporal facts. A model like Allen&apos;s seems more suitable for reasoning at a conceptual level. We will see, in Section 5, how our semantics can be used to generate adverbials of temporal localization. Before doing so, we must see how the generation process is implemented in Pretexte. 4. The Surface Generation Process To implement the surface generation process, we adopted the theory of Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) of Halliday, described in Berry 1975, 1976; Winograd 1983; Matthiessen and Bateman 1991), because it is based on the very nature of the generation process: a selection mechanism. SFG, instead of treating language as a cognitive process, as in the linguistic tradition that follows from Chomsky&apos;s work, considers it a part of social interaction. This bias results in a paradigmatic analysis of language as opposed to the more syntagmatic analyses of the Chomskyan approach: a constituent in a sentence is compared to, or contrasted with, other forms that could have been used. SFG is thus more focused on semantics than on syntax. See Fawcett (1988) for a more detailed description of SFG </context>

The choice of preposition in French is very different from English and it often appears to be arbitrary or conventional. Furthermore, many aspects of the problem are neglected, such as the type of reference expressed by the adverbial: it is not clear how Forster&apos;s system can represent the distinctions between anaphoric, deictic and autonomous localizers because the link between the semantic and syntactic levels is not fully explained. Nigel (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991) offers the widest coverage of English but the variety of forms for ATLs is quite limited. The temporal localization that may be expressed by different types of syntactic structures is represented in Nigel by systems dispersed throughout the whole grammar network. For the expression of temporal localizers, their grammar is more dependent on the syntactic structure than ours, which is mainly determined by the semantics. To summarize, our approach departs from previous approaches by covering more types of adverbials, by proposing a semantics for localization, and by explaining in detail how the </context>

But our approach is a good start and it could be extended by adding more systems and their selection rules, without changing the overall structure of the network. We can see from the approximate translations given in Table 9 that the systems for generating French and English verb tenses differ greatly. For English verb tenses, the method implemented in Nigel resorts to a recursive semantics involving temporal markers, as proposed by Halliday (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991). The purpose in this approach is to deal correctly with complex structures, such as will have been eating. Put simply, the idea is that each auxiliary reflects a relation between two temporal markers. This suggests a network that displays a recursive process. Thus, the phrase will have been going to eat would be represented semantically as to eat at a time that is in the future relative to another time that is in the past relative to a time that is in the future relative to speech time. This method may be adequate for English, since it seems to capture the recursive structure of verb tenses; </context>
