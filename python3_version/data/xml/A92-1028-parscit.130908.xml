A method of anaphoral resolution of zero pronouns
in Japanese language texts using the verbal semantic
attributes is suggested. This method focuses
attention on the semantic attributes of verbs and
examines the context from the relationship between
the semantic attributes of verbs governing zero
pronouns and the semantic attributes of verbs
governing their referents. The semantic attributes of
verbs are created using 2 different viewpoints:
dynamic characteristics of verbs and the relationship
of verbs to cases. By using this method, it is shown
that, in the case of translating newspaper articles, the
major portion (93%) of anaphoral resolution of zero
pronouns necessary for machine translation can be
achieved by using only linguistic knowledge.
Factors to be given special attention when
incorporating this method into a machine translation
system are examined, together with suggested
conditions for the detection of zero pronouns and
methods for their conversion. This study considers
four factors that are important when implementing
this method in a Japanese to English machine
translation system: the difference in conception
between Japanese and English expressions, the
difference in case frame patterns between Japanese
and English, restrictions by voice and restriction by
translation structure. Implementation of the
proposed method with due consideration of these
points leads to a viable method for anaphoral
resolution of zero pronouns in a practical machine
translation system.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999741339285715">
In all natural languages, components that can be easily
deduced by the reader are frequently omitted from expressions
in texts. In Japanese in particular, the subject and object are
often omitted. These phenomena cause problems in
machine translation because components not overtly
indicated in the source language (i.e. Japanese) become
mandatory elements in the target language (i.e. English).
Thus, in Japanese to English translation systems it becomes
necessary to identify corresponding case elements omitted
from the Japanese original (these are referred to as &amp;quot;zero
pronouns&amp;quot;) to be translated into English expressions.
Therefore, the technique of zero pronoun resolution is an
extremely important function.
Several methods have been proposed with regard to this
problem. Grotz et al. proposed the method of resolving
definite noun phrases by using a centering algorithm.
ICameyama expanded this concept by introducing property
sharing constraints and applied it to zero pronoun resolution
in Japanese. This method relies on the types of
postpositional particle and whether there are any empathy-
loaded verbs to exercise control over priority rankings for the
focus of discourse segments.
Yoshimoto suggested a method that uses topics from a
dialogue. This method has focused attention on the
characteristic of the Japanese language where the case for the
sentence is determined by the type of postpositional particle
(e.g. &amp;quot;ha&amp;quot; (pronounced &amp;quot;wa&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;ga&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;wo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ni&amp;quot; indicate
the theme, subject, direct object and indirect object
respectively). The method uses case elements accompanied
by the postpositional particle &amp;quot;ha&amp;quot; and case elements become
the theme or subject matter through expressions governed by
a special sentence structure pattern.
Kuno classified zero pronouns into two categories
(pseudo-zero, real-zero) and suggested separate resolution
methods for each category. This method handles pseudo-zero
pronouns (omitted by across-the-board discourse deletion)
and real-zero pronouns (topicalized noun phrase or a noun
phrase existing in a dialogue scene which can become a
referent, somewhat resembling personal pronouns in the
English language) separately from the point of the referent
detection method.
The foregoing methods of anaphoral resolution can be
divided into two major groupings. One uses comparatively
superficial information such as the types of postpositional
particles or the existence / non-existence of interjections.
The other introduces the concepts of plans and scripts.
When considering application to machine translation, the
former leads to problems in the precision of resolutions
because it is restricted to using specified information. The
latter needs common knowledge and world models and to
develop a translation system handling texts over a broad
field, the volume of knowledge to be prepared beforehand is
so large that this method can be regarded as impossible to
realize.
Thus in this paper, attention has been focused on verbal
semantic attributes. We propose a method of resolving zero
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996559">

<bodyText confidence="0.999737857142857">
pronouns common in Japanese discourse. The method uses
the dynamic characteristics of verbs and the relationship
between verbs. The rules needed by this method are
independent of the fields of the source text. Therefore,
anaphora resolution may be conducted with a relatively
small volume of knowledge, so the proposed method is very
suitable for machine translation.

2 Zero Pronouns as viewed from Machine
Translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950066666667">
Zero pronouns are very common in Japanese discourse, but
the number of zero pronouns that actually require resolution
varies according to the purpose for which analysis results are
to be used. For example, the case of a question and answer
system involving a task such as replying to questions from
a user who has just read a sentence. The questions, which
can come from several points of view, must be anticipated,
and practically all of the zero pronouns in the sentence will
require resolution. In contrast, in the case of machine
translation of text, depending on the translation languages,
zero pronouns requiring resolution tend to limited. This
paper considers the task of extracting zero pronouns in a
Japanese to English text machine translation system. We
first examine the four basic factors important in
implementing such a system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.962455">
2.1 The difference in conception between
Japanese and English expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999705333333333">
When extracting zero pronouns in machine translation,
whether the zero pronouns require resolution analysis or not
needs to be decided. For example, in the sentence.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.973279571428571">
(1)X-sha ha 2-gatsu-1 -nichi, ha-dodhisuku-shouchi wo
CompanyX TOP February 1 hard disc device OBJ
hatsubai-suru.
place on sale
&amp;quot;Company X will put on sale the hard disc device from
February 1.&amp;quot;
esubj oobj tsuki-400-dai seisan-suru.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97707580952381">
400 units per month produce
&amp;quot;They produce 400 units of it per month.&amp;quot;
The second sentence has a structure that is centered
around the verb &amp;quot;seisan-suru(produce)&amp;quot; and the subject and
object have become zero pronouns. But to translate the
sentence into natural English, there is a need to rewrite it
into a predicate noun sentence (&amp;quot;da&amp;quot; sentence, so called
because of the original Japanese &amp;quot;Gessan wa 400 dai da&amp;quot;) to
read
(2) Gessan ha 400-dai da.
Monthly production TOP/SUBJ 400 units is
&amp;quot;Monthly production is 400 units&amp;quot;.
To translate the expression in this form, referential
analysis of the zero pronouns of the subject and object of the
verb &amp;quot;produce&amp;quot; is no longer necessary. When translating
this type of expression, the syntactic/semantic structure of
the sentence to be translated is first converted into an
English type structure in the source language (This is makes
the Japanese-Japanese conversion) in an analysis phase.
Selection of only zero pronouns whose referent needs to
resolved becomes possible.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.944914">
2.2 The difference in case frame patterns
between Japanese and English
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863">
There are verbs, the case elements of which are mandatory in
Japanese but optional when translated into English. For
example, an expression such as,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.960218333333333">
(3) X (facility) de Y (animals) wo kau.
X at Y OBJ keep
&amp;quot;At Y(facility), X(animals) are being kept.&amp;quot;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963">
in which there is no subject in Japanese, it would be
possible to translate this by using the expression,&amp;quot; X raise
Y&amp;quot;. In cases such as this, it would be useful to prepare case
patterns to be used for syntactic analysis for each and every
translation of English verb form and designate the English
case structure when analyzing the Japanese. Elements which
do not become mandatory cases in English will then not be
mandatory cases in Japanese either. Thus deciding which
zero pronouns must be analyzed can be done accurately.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999366">
2.3 Restrictions by Voice
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999511333333333">
Elements which have become zero pronouns in Japanese
will, if the voice can be changed to give natural English, not
need to be resolved. For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986617">
• A sentence originally in the passive voice
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.948335">
In this case, converting the English expression to passive
voice will limit the zero pronouns for which the referent
must be identified.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.79185025">
• Sentences containing verbs which take the passive voice
in Japanese become active in English. For example, the
expression,
(4)A ga B (document) ni keisai-sareru.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.936307615384615">
A OBJ B in publish-PASSIVE
&amp;quot;A is published in B.&amp;quot;
is the passive expression of &amp;quot;fasubj publishes A in B&amp;quot; in
which the subject has become a zero pronoun. In English,
however, even though there is no subject in Japanese, it is
possible to =slate this to the expression &amp;quot;A appears in B&amp;quot;.
In cases such as this, case frame patterns must be prepared
by modifying the English language to be used in syntactic
analysis. When analyzing the Japanese, it is possible to
limit the number of zero pronouns which must be resolved
by limiting mandatory case patterns to those instances that
are accompanied by passive aspects which are mandatory
cases in the English case pattern.

2.4 Restriction by translation structure

&amp;quot;They increased the number of units to be connected by

the verbs &amp;quot;incorporate&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;increase&amp;quot; have turned the subject
into a zero pronoun. The sentence with &amp;quot;Kumikomu-
koto(incorporate-EMBEDDED)&amp;quot; is structured as an
&amp;quot;embedded sentence&amp;quot; modifying the action &amp;quot;koto&amp;quot;.
Translated into English, the portion &amp;quot;koro de&amp;quot; becomes the
methodical case &amp;quot;by incorporating software into the OS&amp;quot; and
assumes a gerund phrase expression. That is the embedded
sentence in Japanese becomes a prepositional phrase
accompanied by a gerund phrase. Because different sentence
structures are generated between Japanese and English, zero
pronouns need to be extracted by converting the Japanese
original to an English like syntactic/semantic structure.
In a Japanese to English machine translation system, it
is important to classify zero pronouns with due
consideration of the factors outlined above.

3. Appearance of Zero Pronouns in
Newspaper Articles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937370823529412">
With due consideration of the conditions as presented in
Chapter 2, we examine where troublesome zero pronouns
and their referents appear in newspaper articles. Newspaper
articles generally tend to use compressed forms of
expressions. Thus, declinable words are frequently turned
into nouns by compressing the declinable suffixes. Thus,
more often than not, it is impossible to determine the zero
pronoun&apos;s referent merely by relying on postpositional
particle information, themes or the types of empathy-loaded
verbs. For example,
(6) NTT ha shingata-koukanki wo dounyuu-sita.
NTT TOP new model switchboard OBJ introduce
&amp;quot;NTT will introduce a new model switchboard.&amp;quot;
asubj jiko-shindan-kinou wo tousai,

<bodyText confidence="0.996962545454545">
200 systems OBJ install be-planning-to
&amp;quot;NTT is planning to install 200 systems.&amp;quot;
In the first sentence, the subject is topicalized, but in the
second sentence, the subject of the first portion of the
sentence and the subject of the latter portion of the sentence
are zero pronouns. Of the two zero pronouns, in the former
case, the &amp;quot;shingata-koukanki&amp;quot;(new model switchboard),
which is the object of the former sentence, and in the latter
case, &amp;quot;NTT&amp;quot; , which is the subject of the former sentence
become the referents. Thus, when there are elements which
have been topicalized, and there are no other elements that
can be topicalized, it cannot be taken for granted that
topicalized elements will become the resolution elements for
zero pronouns. Under such circumstances, there is a need for
information other than whether the element has been
topicalized or not, such as further semantic restrictions.
The lead paragraphs in 29 newspaper articles, totaling
102 sentences in all, were examined for zero pronouns and
their referents, and the results are shown in Table 1. There
were 88 cases of zero pronouns. According to this study,
the case where elements topicalized by the postpositional
particle &amp;quot;ha&amp;quot; in the first sentence became the referents of zero
pronouns when being made the subject in the second
sentence, was most common, with 45 instances (51%).
Furthermore, zero pronouns having referents in the first
sentence, totalled 76 instances (86%). With newspaper
articles, the first sentence contains information that gives an
outline of the entire article and thus the case element tends
to become the referent. There were 67 instances (74%) of
zero pronoun referents in the second and following sentences
being used by the first sentence amounted to 67
instances(74%) which strongly suggests the importance of
the first sentence.

Moreover, there were 12 instances (14%) where the
referent was neither the theme nor the subject; the zero
pronoun is the subject. From this, it can be observed that
it would be inappropriate to rely solely on the technique of
selecting the referent from case elements that have been
topicalized or of determining the order of priorities for
resolution elements from the type of postpositional particle.
These 12 instances were studied further and found to contain
verbs that included the referent. Such verbs were
&amp;quot;hatsubaisuru&amp;quot; (sell), &amp;quot;kaisetsusuru&amp;quot; (establish),
&amp;quot;kaihatsusuru&amp;quot; (develop) and other such words intended to
introduce new object elements. Verbs for zero pronouns tend
to be a noun predicate as in &amp;quot;LAN da&amp;quot; (That is LAN) -- [In
English, it would correspond to the expression, &amp;quot;el be
&lt;noun&gt;&amp;quot;] or, to words such as &amp;quot;belong to&amp;quot; indicating
attributes. To resolve this type of zero pronoun, it would
appear essential that verb attributes be categorized and the
zero pronoun referent be determined from the relationships of
verbal semantic attributes.

4 Classification of Verbal Semantic
Attributes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998328">
As mentioned in the preceding chapter, the resolution of
certain types of zero pronouns that could not be dealt with
by conventional methods, may now be resolved by using
semantic information. Therefore, in this chapter, the verbal
semantic attributes will be categorized for the purpose of
resolving zero pronouns using only linguistic knowledge
(i.e. not world knowledge). The referent of zero pronouns
will be determined by the relationship between attributes.
Japanese verbs will be categorized using the following 2
viewpoints.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.864379">

and the reaction brought about to discourse situation by

Ex. &amp;quot;motsu&amp;quot;(to have) --- Possession
&amp;quot;kaihatsusuru&amp;quot;(to develop) --- Production
•Relationship of Verbs to Cases
Ex.&amp;quot;kanseisuru&amp;quot;:SUBJ be completed-&gt;SUBJ be produced
&amp;quot;kaihatsusuru&amp;quot;:SUBJ develop OBJ-&gt;SUBJ produce OBJ
The conceptual system of verbs as categorized by these
standards is shown in Figure 1.
Next, we consider the relationship between verbs, by
examining the information regarding the relationships
within sentences containing zero pronouns and assess
whether this information will be furnished anew to sentences
containing the referent. The verbal semantic attribute (VSA)
between verbs governing the referent and the verb governing
the zero pronoun can be summarized in the form shown in
Table 2. The use of this relationship will make it possible
to make an assumption of verbal relationship and to
determine the referential elements of zero pronouns based on
the relationship of the two factors of verbal semantic
attributes.
As mentioned in Chapter 3, the first sentence of the lead
paragraph in a newspaper article often consists of a
discourse structure that presents an outline of the contents of
the entire article. Here, we shall refer to a unit sentence of
this type as a &amp;quot;topicalized unit sentence&amp;quot;, and based on its
semantic attributes, the referents of zero pronouns in
sentences that follow will be selected.
By relying on the categorization of verbal semantic
attributes, and observing the rules for determining the
referential elements of zero pronouns as described by its
attribute value, we find that it is possible to describe multi-
purpose anaphora resolution analysis rules which do not rely
on the target domain of the analysis. Thus because, the
information that is required for analysis is contained within
the scope of linguistic knowledge, anaphora resolution ol
zero pronouns using this method can be applied to machine
translation.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995672571428572">
The structure of the system for resolution of zero pronouns
using verbal semantic attributes is shown in Figure 2. The
Japanese sentence to be analyzed has already undergone
morphological analysis, syntactic/semantic analysis, and the
results are input to context analysis. In context analysis,
anaphora resolution of zero pronouns is conducted as
follows.
(Step 1) --Detection of zero pronouns.
If they exist, examine whether there are referents
within the same sentence.
If they exist, and resolution is concluded, proceed
to Step 4
Resolution of referents within the same sentence relies on
two types of methods.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9918535">
1) Anaphoral resolution of zero pronouns based on the type
of conjunction
2) Anaphoral resolution based on
verbal semantic attributes
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994802428571429">
The first method uses
constraints where anaphoral
elements determine the syntactic
structure depending on the type of
postpositional particle and of
conjunctions. A portion of the
rules for determining anaphoral
elements depending on the type of
conjunctions is shown in Table3.
The second method is when, within
the same sentence, anaphoral
elements cannot be determined
based on conjunctions (for example,
when three or more types of unit
sentences exist within the same
sentence), anaphoral resolution is
then conducted using VSA.
(Step 2)--When they do not exist
within the same
sentence,referent candidates are selected from
among the case elements of topicalized unit
sentences that are retained within the contextual
information stage sector. The standard for
selection will be based on the relationship
between VSA of verbs governed by zero pronouns
and VSA of topicalized unit sentences and on the
rules for designating verbs given in Table 2.
When constraints by verbs are satisfied, anaphoral
relationships become valid and proceed to Step 4.
(Step 3)--When the referent cannot be detected, handle as
&amp;quot;processing impossible&amp;quot;.
Based on the semantic restrictions imposed on the
zero pronoun by the verbs, conjecture anaphoral
elements.
(Step 4)--From the knowledge base for sentence structure
control, use the rules for extraction of topicalized
unit sentences determined by relying on the
sentence structure of target field of analysis&apos; to
select the topicalized unit sentence and have the
context information retaining sector retain the
sentence.
Proceed to the next sentence.

The results of analyzing the first sentence are used to
extract the topicalized unit sentence. In example (7), the
first sentence is structured from the unit sentence and the
result of analysis is stored in the context information storage
sector as the topicalized unit sentence. Next, from the
analysis results of the second sentence, it can be understood
that the subjects of &amp;quot;tousaisuru (is outfitted with or equipped
with)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;yoteida (is planning to)&amp;quot; have been converted to
zero pronouns. Since there are no referents within the same
sentence, the case element within the topicalized unit
sentence becomes the referent candidate. The VSA of
&amp;quot;tousaisuru&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;yoteida&amp;quot; are respectively, &amp;quot;POSS&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;THINK-ACT&amp;quot;, and the VSA of topicalized unit sentence

to the rules given in Table 2, &amp;quot;Detailed explanation&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;Policy decision&amp;quot; are established as the verbal semantic
relationships and the object and subject of the topicalized

The following is an outline of the processing undertaken by
the Japanese to English machine translation system, ALT-
J/E (See Figure 3). First, a morphological analysis of the
input Japanese sentence is conducted, followed by a

sentences2 are extracted based on results of the relationships
between verbs, and from these a simple unit sentence3 is
extracted. Subjective expression information such as

parsed to the level where it has only one predicate..

sentence to yield the objective simple unit sentence. This
objective simple unit sentence, as shown in Figure 4, is
collated with two types of pattern dictionaries having
predicates as index words (the idiomatic expression transfer
dictionary and the semantic valentz pattern transfer
dictionary). When there is no appropriate pattern, a general
pattern transfer rule is applied. This determines the syntactic
and semantic structure pattern that is used in Japanese to
English conversion. In the cases of (3) and (4) in Chapter 2,

they are not identified during processing as cases of zero
pronouns. If numerous interpretations remain at this point,
a single and final interpretation is decided on, based on the
results of interpretation of the pattern at the objective simple
unit sentence level. Also, as seen in (1) and (7) of Chapter
2, when there is a wide difference between the structures in
Japanese and English, converting the Japanese structure
resulting from analysis to a structure as close as possible to
the English expression can make it possible to avoid
referential analysis; only the zero pronouns that are used in
the English translation need to be treated. If, after the
foregoing analysis, zero pronouns still remain, anaphora
resolution using the context is conducted as shown in
Chapter 5. At this stage, the sentence pattern used in
generating the unit sentence is established and all that
remains is to use this to generate the backbone expression in
English, adding other relevant information such as modality,
tense and conjunction. In doing so, care should be taken to
avoid the situation where extracting zero pronouns after
correspondence analysis results in verbose English. In this
case elliptical pronouns and definite articles should be used.

8. Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934346153846">
This paper has suggested a powerful method for anaphora&apos;
resolution using VSA to deal with the zero pronouns
appearing in Japanese texts. With previously suggested
methods, it was difficult to realize pronominal resolution of
zero pronouns in a practical translation system due to the
huge volume of knowledge necessary (common sense and
world knowledge). In contrast, the proposed method, which
utilizes semantic attributes of categorized verbs, makes it
unnecessary to describe rules unique to various fields. With
a comparatively limited volume of knowledge, it is thus
possible to anaphorically resolve zero pronouns. This
method has been realized in the machine translation system
ALT-J/E. ALT-J/E was assessed by processing common
Japanese newspaper articles. It was found that 93% of the
Japanese zero pronouns requiring anaphora&apos; resolution had
their referents determined correctly.
One possible application of this method in context
processing would be to generate an abridged text based on a
structural analysis of sentences in the entire article and
categorization of contents of the articles focusing on the
VSA of the first sentence in each text.
In this report, the target sentences were limited to
newspaper article lead paragraphs and comparatively short
sentences. In the future, studies need to be made on changes
in topic and sentences with a complicated discourse
structure.

<abstract confidence="0.99970490625">A method of anaphoral resolution of zero pronouns in Japanese language texts using the verbal semantic attributes is suggested. This method focuses attention on the semantic attributes of verbs and examines the context from the relationship between the semantic attributes of verbs governing zero pronouns and the semantic attributes of verbs governing their referents. The semantic attributes of verbs are created using 2 different viewpoints: dynamic characteristics of verbs and the relationship of verbs to cases. By using this method, it is shown that, in the case of translating newspaper articles, the major portion (93%) of anaphoral resolution of zero pronouns necessary for machine translation can be achieved by using only linguistic knowledge. Factors to be given special attention when incorporating this method into a machine translation system are examined, together with suggested conditions for the detection of zero pronouns and methods for their conversion. This study considers four factors that are important when implementing this method in a Japanese to English machine translation system: the difference in conception between Japanese and English expressions, the difference in case frame patterns between Japanese and English, restrictions by voice and restriction by translation structure. Implementation of the proposed method with due consideration of these points leads to a viable method for anaphoral resolution of zero pronouns in a practical machine translation system.</abstract>
