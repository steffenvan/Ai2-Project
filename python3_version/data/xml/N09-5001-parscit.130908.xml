Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99723925">
Traditional Information Extraction (IE) sys-
tems identify many unconnected facts. The
objective of this paper is to define a new
cross-document information extraction task
and demonstrate a system which can extract,
rank and track events in two dimensions: tem-
poral and spatial. The system can automati-
cally label the person entities involved in
significant events as &apos;centroid arguments&apos;, and
then present the events involving the same
centroid on a time line and on a geographical
map.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999518714285714">
Information Extraction (IE) systems can identify
‘facts’ (entities, relations and events) of particular
types within individual documents, and so can
unleash the knowledge embedded in texts for many
domains, such as military monitoring, daily news,
financial analysis and biomedical reports. However,
most current IE systems focus on processing single
documents and, except for coreference resolution,
operate a sentence at a time. The result are large
databases containing many unconnected, unranked,
redundant (and some erroneous) facts.
McNamara (2001) proved that a high-coherence
text has fewer conceptual gaps and thus requires
fewer inferences and less prior knowledge, render-
ing the text easier to understand. In our task text
coherence is the extent to which the relationships
between events in a text can be made explicit. We
noted that linking all events in temporal and spatial
directions for the entire corpus was not feasible
because of the large number of event arguments.
Grosz et al. (1995) claimed that certain entities are

more central than others and that this property im-
posed constraints on discourse coherence. There-
fore we have developed a system which can extract
globally salient and novel arguments as centroid
arguments, and link all events involving each cen-
troid argument on a time line and on a geographi-
cal map.
Beyond extracting isolated facts from individual
sentences, we provide coherent event chains so that
the users can save time in connecting relevant
events and conducting reasoning, such as tracking
a person’s movement activities and an organiza-
tion’s personnel changes. This will provide a richer
set of views than is possible with document clus-
tering for summarization or with topic tracking. In
addition, such cross-document extraction results
are indexed and allow a fast entity searching
mechanism. Beyond traditional search, the system
can correlate and organize information across dif-
ferent time series by temporal tracking, and deliver
to users in different geographies by spatial tracking.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 presents the overall system architecture
including the baseline system and the detailed ap-
proaches to extract event chains. Section 3 then
presents the experimental results compared to tra-
ditional IE. Section 4 demonstrates the system out-
put. Section 5 compares our approach with related
work and Section 6 then concludes the paper and
sketches our future work.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978846153846">
We first apply a state-of-the-art English IE system
(Ji and Grishman, 2008) to extract events from
each single document. The IE system includes en-
tity extraction, time expression extraction and
normalization, relation extraction and event extrac-
tion. Entities include persons, locations, organiza-
tions, facilities, vehicles and weapons; Events
include the 33 distinct event types defined in
Automatic Content Extraction (ACE05)1.
The event extraction system combines pattern
matching with statistical models. For every event
instance in the ACE training corpus, patterns are
constructed based on the sequences of constituent
heads separating the trigger and arguments. In ad-
dition, a set of Maximum Entropy classifiers are
trained: to distinguish events from non-events; to
classify events by type and subtype; to distinguish
arguments from non-arguments; to classify argu-
ments by argument role; and given a trigger, an
event type, and a set of arguments, to determine
whether there is a reportable event mention. In ad-
dition, the global evidence from related documents
is combined with local decisions to conduct cross-
document inference for improving the extraction
performance as described in (Ji and Grishman,
2008).

2.2 Centroid Argument Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973125636363636">
After we harvest a large repository of events we
can label those important person entities which are
involved frequently in events as ‘centroid argu-
ments’. Not only are such arguments central to the
information in a collection (high-frequency), they
also should have higher accuracy (high-
confidence). In this project we exploit global con-
fidence metrics to reach both of these two goals.
For an event mention, the within-document
event classifiers produce the following local confi-
dences values:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.897949444444444">
• LConf(trigger,etype): The probability of a
string trigger indicating an event mention with
type etype.
• LConf(arg, etype): The probability that a men-
tion arg is an argument of some particular
event type etype.
• LConf(arg, etype, role): If arg is an argument
with event type etype, the probability of arg
having some particular role.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992065">
We use the INDRI information retrieval system
(Strohman et al., 2005) to obtain the top N related
documents for each test document to form a topi-
cally-related cluster. The intuition is that if an ar-
gument appears frequently as well as with high
extraction confidence in a cluster, it is more salient.
For each argument arg we also added other person
names coreferential with or bearing some ACE
relation to the argument as argset.
In addition we developed a cross-document per-
son name disambiguation component based on
heuristic rules to resolve ambiguities among cen-
troid arguments. Then we define the following global
metric weighted with the local confidence values to
measure salience, and generate the top-ranked entities
as centroid arguments.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6175578">
• Global-Confidence(arg): The frequency of
argset appearing as an event argument in a
cluster, weighted by local confidence values:
LConf(trigger,etype)*LConf(arg, etype)*
LConf(arg, etype, role).

2.3 Cross-document Event Aggregation and
Global Time Discovery
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965578947368">
If two events involve the same centroid argument,
we order them along a time line according to their
time arguments and group them into specific geo-
graphical locations based on their place arguments.
When ordering a pair of entity arguments, we re-
place pronouns with their coreferential names or
nominals, and replace nominals with their corefer-
ential names, if applicable. If the normalized dates
are the same for two events, we further compare
them based on their time roles (e.g. ‘time-end’
should be ordered after ‘time-beginning’).
We start from aggregating events by merging
coreferential event mentions using the within-
document coreference resolution component in the
IE system. However, the degree of similarity
among events contained in a group of topically-
related documents is much higher than within a
document, as each document is apt to describe the
main point as well as necessary shared background.

3 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999716">
We used 10 newswire texts from ACE 2005 train-
ing corpora as our test. For each test text we re-
trieved 25 related texts from English Topic
Detection and Tracking (TDT-5)2 corpus which in
total consists of 278,108 texts. The IE system ex-
tracted 179 event mentions including 140 Name
arguments. We define an argument is correctly
extracted if its event type, offsets, and role match
any of the reference argument mentions.
We found that after ranking with the global con-
fidence metrics, the top-ranked event arguments
are substantially more accurate than the arguments
as a whole: the overall accuracy without ranking is
about 53%; but after ranking the top 85 arguments
(61% of total) get accuracy above 70% and the top
116 arguments (83% of total) are above 60% accu-
racy. It suggests that aggregating and ranking
events according to global evidence can enable
users to access salient and accurate information
rapidly.

Recently there has been heightened interest in dis-
covering temporal event chains. For example,
Bethard and Martin (2008) applied supervised
learning to classify temporal and causal relations
simultaneously. Chambers and Jurafsky (2008)
extracted narrative event chains based on common
protagonists. In this paper we import these ideas
into IE while take into account some major differ-
ences. Following the original idea of centering
(Grosz et al., 1995) and the approach of centering
events involving protagonists (Chambers and Ju-
rafsky, 2008), we introduce a new concept of ‘cen-
troid arguments’ to represent those entities which
are involved in all kinds of salient events fre-
quently. We operate cross-document instead of
within-document, which requires us to resolve
more conflicts and ambiguities. In addition, we
study the temporal and spatial linking task on top
of IE results. In this way we extend the representa-
tion of each node in the chains to a structured ag-
gregated event including fine-grained information
such as event types, arguments and their roles.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999595076923077">
In this paper we described several new modes for
browsing and searching a large collection of news
articles, and demonstrated a system implementing
these modes. We introduced ranking methods into
IE, so that the extracted events are connected into
temporal and spatial chains and presented to the
user in an order of salience. We believe these new
forms of presentation are likely to be highly bene-
ficial, especially to users whose native language is
not English, by distilling the information landscape
contained in the large collection of daily news arti-
cles – making more information sources accessible
and useful to them.
On the other hand, for the users searching news
about particular person entities, our system can
suggest a list of centroid event arguments as key
words, and provide a brief story by presenting all
connected events. We believe this will signifi-
cantly speed up text comprehension. In this paper
we only demonstrated the results for person enti-
ties, but this system can be naturally extended to
other entity types, such as company names to track
their start/end/acquire/merge activities. In addition,
we plan to automatically adjust cross-document
event aggregation operations according to specific
compression ratios provided by the users.

The intuition is that if an argument appears frequently as well as with high extraction confidence in a cluster, it is more salient. For each argument arg we also added other person names coreferential with or bearing some ACE relation to the argument as argset. In addition we developed a cross-document person name disambiguation component based on heuristic rules to resolve ambiguities among centroid arguments. Then we define the following global metric weighted with the local confidence values </context>
