Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999563">
It has previously been proposed that a
Centering-style theory might be integrated with
Dynamic Semantics, in a way that solves prob-
lems associated with strict and sloppy readings
of pronouns. However, I show that this inte-
gration is in fact inconsistent with Centering. I
trace the problem to an implicit assumption in
Centering that coherence relations are primar-
ily entity-based. I present a modified version of
Centering, Dynamic Centering, in which this as-
sumption is removed. This makes it possible to
successfully integrate Centering with Dynamic
Semantics. I show that this results in a simpler
as well as more empirically successful version of
Centering.

1 Background: Centering and
Sloppy Identity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.936103680851064">
Consider the problem of strict and sloppy read-
ings of pronouns, illustrated by (1):
Ellen, was talking to Mary3 and
Susank about cats.
Mary3 loves her3 cat.
a. Susank loves her3 cat too. (strict)
b. Susank loves herk cat too. (sloppy)
c. Susank loves her, cat too. (other)
The terms strict and sloppy are originally due
to (Ross, 1967), where they were applied to
cases involving ellipsis. In the above example,
the VP &amp;quot;loves her cat&amp;quot; can be elided. Whether
&amp;quot;loves her cat&amp;quot; is overt or elided does not change
the interpretive possibilities in this example.
Although the analysis of the differences between
elliptical sentences and their overt counterparts
is an important area of research, I will ignore
this issue in this paper, and assume that the
ellipsis case is interpretively analogous to the
above overt examples.
It is widely accepted that the strict and
sloppy readings are equally acceptable, while
the other reading is impossible. In a series of
papers (Hardt, 1996; Hardt, 1999; Stone and
Hardt, 1997; Hardt, 2003) I have previously sug-
gested that Centering Theory might provide an
account of this. These papers do not apply Cen-
tering in a systematic way. Rather, they rely
on certain claims that are inspired by Center-
ing. First, in sentences with a single pronoun,
that pronoun must refer to the Center. Second,
there is a preference that Center Shifts are as-
sociated with Subjects, or otherwise prominent
NP&apos;s.
I employ the following notational conven-
tions: a pronoun referring to the Center is no-
tated with a * subscript, while an NP that
shifts the Center is notated with a * superscript.
This follows a well-established convention in dy-
namic semantics that superscripted indices in-
dicate context change, while subscripts do not.
The * is meant to indicate position 0 in the cur-
rent state (or assignment function). All NP&apos;s
also receive ordinary indices as well; this ensure
that an individual remains accessible after it is
no longer the Center.
The three readings are indexed as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9982235">
(4) Ellen*i was talking to Mary3 and
Susank about cats.
(5) Mary* loves her cat.
(6) a. Susank loves her cat too. (strict)
b. Susan* loves her cat too. (sloppy)
c. Susank loves her, cat too. (other)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929">
First, Ellen is established as the Center.
Next, the Center shifts to Mary. Then for the
strict reading, the Center remains Mary, while
for the sloppy reading, it shifts to Susan. In
both cases, the pronoun refers to the Center, as
required since it is the only pronoun. For the
other, the pronoun does not refer to the Center.
The Centering approach to strict/sloppy al-
ternation is proposed as an alternative to se-
mantic accounts (Sag, 1976) which rely on vari-
able binding. I have argued that the variable
binding account predicts that the antecedent for
a sloppy pronoun (&amp;quot;Susan&amp;quot; in the above exam-
ple) must be sister to a constituent containing
the sloppy pronoun; the Centering account is
somewhat more flexible; it involves a preference
that the antecedent must be rather prominent,
but does not impose a specific structural con-
straint. From this perspective, one would ex-
pect that sloppy identity is somewhat flexible
concerning the structural position of the an-
tecedent, as long as it is contextually prominent.
It has long been recognized that sloppy iden-
tity exhibits precisely this sort of flexibility.
This poses a major problem for the variable
binding account, and (Hardt, 2003) points out
that a recent attempt (Tomioka, 1999) to solve
this problem requires substantial complication
of the syntax-semantics interface, and appears
to encounter substantial empirical problems as
well.
This proposal is attractive in that it imports
independently required principles concerning
the processing of pronouns. It arguably ac-
counts for strict-sloppy alternation better than
alternative accounts, and avoids any complica-
tions to the mechanisms of syntax and seman-
tics.

2 The Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990125416666667">
Unfortunately, there is a serious problem with
this rosy scenario: Centering Theory as it is gen-
erally understood fails utterly to capture the
facts in examples involving strict-sloppy alter-
nation. While it is generally agreed that the
strict and sloppy readings are both acceptable,
and the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; reading impossible, Centering
only permits the strict reading, treating the
sloppy reading on a par with the impossible
&amp;quot;other&amp;quot; reading.
To show this, I will first give a brief presen-
tation of Centering Theory.

backward-looking center)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99604">
The ordering of the Cf list is an intensive area

syntactic prominence, with the subject the most

The above claims are instantiated in the BFP
algorithm(Brennan et al., 1987). For purposes
of comparison, it is convenient to use the for-
mulation of (Beaver, 2002), COT. This is an
OT (Optimality Theory) version of Centering,
in terms of ordered constraints. Beaver shows
that COT is equivalent to the BFP algorithm.

The reader is referred to (Beaver, 2002) for
details. The FAM-DEF constraint is not rele-
vant to the issues discussed in this paper. Also,
while ALIGN is described as a requirement that
Cb be in subject position, it might better be ex-
pressed in somewhat more broad terms, for ex-
ample, that the Cb is (syntactically) prominent.
However, for simplicity I will leave ALIGN as
defined by Beaver in this paper.

it would incorrectly permit the following non-
parallel reading:
(31) John talked to Fred about Fred&apos;s
problems, and Bill did too. [talk to
Fred about Bill&apos;s problems]
A center shift from Fred in the first sentence
to Bill in the second would give rise to the
above, incorrect reading. However, it should be
clear from the preceding discussion that such
readings are to be ruled out by the general par-
allelism theory, which as I have argued, is inde-
pendently needed. While space doesn&apos;t permit
a detailed study of the integration of Dynamic
Centering with a general parallelism theory, it
seems clear that a theory such as Rooth&apos;s would
naturally rule out the above reading: Rooth&apos;s
theory requires non-accented material in the
second sentence to semantically match corre-
sponding material in the first sentence. It is
clear that the above reading violates this re-
quirement.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998170625">
It has previously been proposed that Centering
be integrated with Dynamic Semantics, to ad-
dress the problem of strict-sloppy alternations
in pronoun interpretation. However, Centering
as currently formulated fails when applied to
such examples. I have argued that this results
from an assumption in Centering that entity-
based coherence is more important than other
aspects of coherence. I argue that this assump-
tion is false, and I propose a version of Cen-
tering, Dynamic Centering, in which the CO-
HERE constraint is removed from Centering.
This makes it possible to integrate Centering
with Dynamic Semantics. I show that this has
several important empirical benefits over stan-
dard Centering.

This is an OT (Optimality Theory) version of Centering, in terms of ordered constraints. Beaver shows that COT is equivalent to the BFP algorithm. 2.1 Beaver&apos;s COT COT consists of the following ordered constraints: • AGREE: Anaphoric expressions agree with their antecedents in terms of number and gender. • DISJOINT: Co-arguments of a predicate are disjoint. • PRO-TOP: The Cb is pronominalized.&apos; • FAM-DEF: Each definite NP is familiar. • COHERE: The Cb of the current sentence is the Cb of the previous </context>

This makes it possible to successfully integrate Centering with Dynamic Semantics. I show that this results in a simpler as well as more empirically successful version of Centering. 1 Background: Centering and Sloppy Identity Consider the problem of strict and sloppy readings of pronouns, illustrated by (1): Ellen, was talking to Mary3 and Susank about cats. Mary3 loves her3 cat. a. Susank loves her3 cat too. (strict) b. Susank loves herk cat too. (sloppy) c. Susank loves her, cat too. (other) The terms strict and sloppy are originally due to (Ross, 1967), where they were applied to cases involving ellipsis. In the above example, the VP &amp;quot;loves her cat&amp;quot; can be elided. Whether &amp;quot;loves her cat&amp;quot; is overt or elided does not change the interpretive possibilities in this example. Although the analysis of the differences between elliptical sentences and their overt counterparts is an important area of research, I will ignore this issue in this paper, and assume that the ellipsis case is interpretively analogous to the above overt examples.

Susan* loves her cat too. (sloppy) c. Susank loves her, cat too. (other) First, Ellen is established as the Center. Next, the Center shifts to Mary. Then for the strict reading, the Center remains Mary, while for the sloppy reading, it shifts to Susan. In both cases, the pronoun refers to the Center, as required since it is the only pronoun. For the other, the pronoun does not refer to the Center. The Centering approach to strict/sloppy alternation is proposed as an alternative to semantic accounts (Sag, 1976) which rely on variable binding. I have argued that the variable binding account predicts that the antecedent for a sloppy pronoun (&amp;quot;Susan&amp;quot; in the above example) must be sister to a constituent containing the sloppy pronoun; the Centering account is somewhat more flexible; it involves a preference that the antecedent must be rather prominent, but does not impose a specific structural constraint.
