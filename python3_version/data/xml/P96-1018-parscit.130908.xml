This paper describes an accurate and
robust text alignment system for struc-
turally different languages. Among
structurally different languages such as
Japanese and English, there is a limitation
on the amount of word correspondences
that can be statistically acquired. The
proposed method makes use of two kinds
of word correspondences in aligning bilin-
gual texts. One is a bilingual dictionary of
general use. The other is the word corre-
spondences that are statistically acquired
in the alignment process. Our method
gradually determines sentence pairs (an-
chors) that correspond to each other by re-
laxing parameters. The method, by com-
bining two kinds of word correspondences,
achieves adequate word correspondences
for complete alignment. As a result, texts
of various length and of various genres
in structurally different languages can be
aligned with high precision. Experimen-
tal results show our system outperforms
conventional methods for various kinds of
Japanese-English texts.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949389830509">
Corpus-based approaches based on bilingual texts
are promising for various applications(i.e., lexical
knowledge extraction (Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et
al., 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Dagan and Church,
1994; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Haruno et al.,
1996), machine translation (Brown and others, 1993;
Sato and Nagao, 1990; Kaji et al., 1992) and infor-
mation retrieval (Sato, 1992)). Most of these works
assume voluminous aligned corpora.
Many methods have been proposed to align bilin-
gual corpora. One of the major approaches is based
on the statistics of simple features such as sentence
length in words (Brown and others, 1991) or in
characters (Gale and Church, 1993). These tech-
niques are widely used because they can be imple-
mented in an efficient and simple way through dy-
namic programing. However, their main targets are
rigid translations that are almost literal translations.
In addition, the texts being aligned were structurally
similar European languages (i.e., English-French,
English-German).
The simple-feature based approaches don&apos;t work
in flexible translations for structurally different lan-
guages such as Japanese and English, mainly for the
following two reasons. One is the difference in the
character types of the two languages. Japanese has
three types of characters (Hiragana, Katakana, and
Kanji), each of which has different amounts of in-
formation. In contrast, English has only one type
of characters. The other is the grammatical and
rhetorical difference of the two languages. First, the
systems of functional (closed) words are quite differ-
ent from language to language. Japanese has a quite
different system of closed words, which greatly influ-
ence the length of simple features. Second, due to
rhetorical difference, the number of multiple match
(i.e., 1-2, 1-3, 2-1 and so on) is more than that among
European languages. Thus, it is impossible in gen-
eral to apply the simple-feature based methods to
Japanese-English translations.
One alternative alignment method is the lexicon-
based approach that makes use of the word-
correspondence knowledge of the two languages.
(Church, 1993) employed n-grams shared by two lan-
guages. His method is also effective for Japanese-
English computer manuals both containing lots of
the same alphabetic technical terms. However,
the method cannot be applied to general transla-
tions in structurally different languages. (Kay and
Roscheisen, 1993) proposed a relaxation method to
iteratively align bilingual texts using the word cor-
respondences acquired during the alignment pro-
cess. Although the method works well among Euro-
pean languages, the method does not work in align-
ing structurally different languages. In Japanese-
English translations, the method does not capture
enough word correspondences to permit alignment.
As a result, it can align only some of the two texts.
This is mainly because the syntax and rhetoric are

<bodyText confidence="0.999639674418605">
greatly differ in the two languages even in literal
translations. The number of confident word cor-
respondences of words is not enough for complete
alignment. Thus, the problem cannot be addressed
as long as the method relies only on statistics. Other
methods in the lexicon-based approach embed lex-
ical knowledge into stochastic models (Wu, 1994;
Chen, 1993), but these methods were tested using
rigid translations.
To tackle the problem, we describe in this
paper a text alignment system that uses both
statistics and bilingual dictionaries at the same
time. Bilingual dictionaries are now widely
available on-line due to advances in CD-ROM
technologies. For example, English-Spanish,
English-French, English-German, English-Japanese,
Japanese-French, Japanese-Chinese and other dic-
tionaries are now commercially available. It is rea-
sonable to make use of these dictionaries in bilingual
text alignment. The pros and cons of statistics and
online dictionaries are discussed below. They show
that statistics and on-line dictionaries are comple-
mentary in terms of bilingual text alignment.
Statistics Merit Statistics is robust in the sense
that it can extract context-dependent usage
of words and that it works well even if word
segmentation&apos; is not correct.
Statistics Demerit The amount of word corre-
spondences acquired by statistics is not enough
for complete alignment.
Dictionaries Merit They can contain the infor-
mation about words that appear only once in
the corpus.
Dictionaries Demerit They cannot capture
context-dependent keywords in the corpus and
are weak against incorrect word segmentation.
Entries in the dictionaries differ from author to
author and are not always the same as those in
the corpus.
Our system iteratively aligns sentences by using
statistical and on-line dictionary word correspon-
dences. The characteristics of the system are as fol-
lows.

• The system performs well and is robust for var-
ious lengths (especially short) and various gen-
res of texts.
• The system is very economical because it as-
sumes only online-dictionaries of general use
and doesn&apos;t require the labor-intensive con-
struction of domain-specific dictionaries.
• The system is extendable by registering statis-
tically acquired word correspondences into user
dictionaries.

words. The first task for alignment is , therefore, to

Figure 1 overviews our alignment system. The
input to the system is a pair of Japanese and En-
glish texts, one the translation of the other. First,
sentence boundaries are found in both texts using
finite state transducers. The texts are then part-
of-speech (POS) tagged and separated into origi-
nal form words&apos;. Original forms of English words
are determined by 80 rules using the POS infor-
mation. From the word sequences, we extract only
nouns, adjectives, adverbs verbs and unknown words
(only in Japanese) because Japanese and English
closed words are different and impede text align-
ment. These pre-processing operation can be easily
implemented with regular expressions.

The initial state of the algorithm is a set of al-
ready known anchors (sentence pairs). These are de-
termined by article boundaries, section boundaries
and paragraph boundaries. In the most general case,
initial anchors are only the first and final sentence
pairs of both texts as depicted in Figure 2. Pos-
sible sentence correspondences are determined from
the anchors. Intuitively, the number of possible cor-
respondences for a sentence is small near anchors,
while large between the anchors. In this phase, the
most important point is that each set of possible
sentence correspondences should include the correct
correspondence.
The main task of the system is to find anchors
from the possible sentence correspondences by us-
ing two kinds of word correspondences: statistical
word correspondences and word correspondences as
held in a bilingual dictionary3. By using both cor-
respondences, the sentence pair whose correspon-
dences exceeds a pre-defined threshold is judged as
an anchor. These newly found anchors make word
correspondences more precise in the subsequent ses-
sion. By repeating this anchor setting process with
threshold reduction, sentence correspondences are
gradually determined from confident pairs to non-
confident pairs. The gradualism of the algorithm
makes it robust because anchor-setting errors in the
last stage of the algorithm have little effect on over-
all performance. The output of the algorithm is the
alignment result (a sequence of anchors) and word
correspondences as by-products.

</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999759">
3.1 Statistics Used
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966133333333">
In this section, we describe the statistics used to
decide word correspondences. From many similar-
ity metrics applicable to the task, we choose mu-
tual information and t-score because the relaxation
of parameters can be controlled in a sophisticated
manner. Mutual information represents the similar-
ity on the occurrence distribution and t-score rep-
resents the confidence of the similarity. These two
parameters permit more effective relaxation than the
single parameter used in conventional methods(Kay
and Roscheisen, 1993).
Our basic data structure is the alignable sen-
tence matrix (ASM) and the anchor matrix (AM).
ASM represents possible sentence correspondences
and consists of ones and zeros. A one in ASM in-
dicates the intersection of the column and row con-
stitutes a possible sentence correspondence. On the
contrary, AM is introduced to represent how a sen-
tence pair is supported by word correspondences.
The i-j Element of AM indicates how many times
the corresponding words appear in the i-j sentence
pair. As alignment proceeds, the number of ones in
ASM reduces, while the elements of AM increase.
Let pi be a sentence set comprising the ith
Japanese sentence and its possible English corre-
spondences as depicted in Figure 3. For example, p2
is the set comprising Jsentence2, Esentence2 and
Esentence3, which means Jsentence2 has the pos-
sibility of aligning with Esentence2 or Esentence3.
The pis can be directly derived from ASM.

&apos;Adding to the bilingual dictionary of general use,
users can reuse their own dictionaries created in previous
sessions.
We introduce the contingency matrix (Fung and
Church, 1994) to evaluate the similarity of word oc-
currences. Consider the contingency matrix shown
Table 1, between Japanese word wjpn and English
word tveng • The contingency matrix shows: (a) the
number of pis in which both wipn and weng were
found, (b) the number of pis in which just weng was

was found. Note here that pis overlap each other
and we may be double counted in the contingency
matrix. We count each weng only once, even if it
occurs more than twice in pis.

<bodyText confidence="0.999807666666667">
If wipn and Weng are good translations of one an-
other, a should be large, and b and c should be small.
In contrast, if the two are not good translations of
each other, a should be small, and b and c should
be large. To make this argument more precise, we
introduce mutual information:

<equation confidence="0.6809835">

Unfortunately, mutual information is not reliable
when the number of occurrences is small. Many
words occur just once which weakens the statistics
approach. In order to avoid this, we employ t-score,
defined below, where M is the number of Japanese
sentences. Insignificant mutual information values
are filtered out by thresholding t-score. For exam-
ple, t-scores above 1.65 are significant at the p &gt;
0.95 confidence level.

3.2 Basic Alignment Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999966">
Our basic algorithm is an iterative adjustment of the
Anchor Matrix (AM) using the Alignable Sentence
Matrix (ASM). Given an ASM, mutual information
and t-score are computed for all word pairs in possi-
ble sentence correspondences. A word combination
exceeding a predefined threshold is judged as a word
correspondence. In order to find new anchors, we
combine these statistical word correspondences with
the word correspondences in a bilingual dictionary.
Each element of AM, which represents a sentence
pair, is updated by adding the number of word cor-
respondences in the sentence pair. A sentence pair
containing more than a predefined number of corre-
sponding words is determined to be a new anchor.
The detailed algorithm is as follows.

3.2.1 Constructing Initial ASM
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955111111111">
This step constructs the initial ASM. If the texts
contain M and N sentences respectively, the ASM
is an M x N matrix. First, we decide a set of an-
chors using article boundaries, section boundaries
and so on. In the most general case, initial anchors
are the first and last sentences of both texts as de-
picted in Figure 2. Next, possible sentence corre-
spondences are generated. Intuitively, true corre-
spondences are close to the diagonal linking the two
anchors. We construct the initial ASM using such
a function that pairs sentences near the middle of
the two anchors with as many as 0(NYL) (L is the
number of sentences existing between two anchors)
sentences in the other text because the maximum
deviation can be stochastically modeled as O(rL)
(Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). The initial ASM has
little effect on the alignment performance so long as
it contains all correct sentence correspondences.

3.2.2 Constructing AM
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999643357142857">
This step constructs an AM when given an ASM
and a bilingual dictionary. Let thigh, tlow -Thigh and
ho„ be two thresholds for t-score and two thresholds
for mutual information, respectively. Let ANC be
the minimal number of corresponding words for a
sentence pair to be judged as an anchor.
First, mutual information and t-score are com-
puted for all word pairs appearing in a possible sen-
tence correspondence in ASM. We use hereafter the
word correspondences whose mutual information ex-
ceeds /low and whose t-score exceeds thnv. For all
possible sentence correspondences Jsentencei and
Esentencej (any pair in ASM), the following op-
erations are applied in order.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999689217391304">
1. If the following three conditions hold, add 3
to the i-j element of AM. (1) Jsentencei and
Esentencej contain a bilingual dictionary word
correspondence (wipn and weng). (2) weng does
not occur in any other English sentence that
is a possible translation of Jsentencei. (3)
Jsentencei and Esentencej do not cross any
sentence pair that has more than ANC word
correspondences.
2. If the following three conditions hold, add 3
to the i-j element of AM. (1) Jsentencei and
Esentencej contain a stochastic word corre-
spondence (wipn and weng) that has mutual
information /high and whose t-score exceeds
thigh. (2) Weng does not occur in any other
English sentence that is a possible translation
of Jsentencei. (3) J sentence, and Esentencej
do not cross any sentence pair that has more
than ANC word correspondences.

how • (2) wens, does not occur in any other
English sentence that is a possible translation
of Jsentencei. (3) Jsentencei and Esentencei
does not cross any sentence pair that has more
than ANC word correspondences.
The first operation deals with word correspon-
dences in the bilingual dictionary. The second op-
eration deals with stochastic word correspondences
which are highly confident and in many cases involve
domain specific keywords. These word correspon-
dences are given the value of 3. The third operation
is introduced because the number of highly confi-
dent corresponding words are too small to align all
sentences. Although word correspondences acquired
by this step are sometimes false translations of each
other, they play a crucial role mainly in the final
iterations phase. They are given one point.

3.2.3 Adjusting ASM
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988333333333">
This step adjusts ASM using the AM constructed
by the above operations. The sentence pairs that
have at least ANC word correspondences are deter-
mined to be new anchors. By using the new set of
anchors, a new ASM is constructed using the same
method as used for initial ASM construction.
Our algorithm implements a kind of relaxation by
gradually reducing tic., how and ANC, which en-
ables us to find confident sentence correspondences
first. As a result, our method is more robust than
dynamic programing techniques against the shortage
of word-correspondence knowledge.

In this section, we report the result of experiments
on aligning sentences in bilingual texts and on sta-

for the experiment varied in length and genres as

taken from &apos;Yomiuri Shinbun&apos; and its English ver-

Our evaluation focuses on much smaller texts than
those used in other study(Brown and others, 1993;
Gale and Church, 1993; Wu, 1994; Fung, 1995; Kay
and Roscheisen, 1993) because our main targets are
well-separated articles. However, our method will
work on larger and noisy sets too, by using word
anchors rather than using sentence boundaries as
segment boundaries. In such a case, the method
constructing initial ASM needs to be modified.
We briefly report here the computation time of
our method. Let us consider Text 4 as an exam-
ple. After 15 seconds for full preprocessing, the
first iteration took 25 seconds with t10„ = 1.55 and
hoev = 1.8. The rest of the algorithm took 20 sec-
onds in all. This experiment was performed on a
SPARC Station 20 Model HS21. From the result,
we may safely say that our method can be applied
to voluminous corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.999592324324324">
Table 3 shows the performance on sentence align-
ments for the texts in Table 2. Combined, Statis-
tics and Dictionary represent the methods using
both statistics and dictionary, only statistics and
only dictionary, respectively. Both Combined and
Dictionary use a CD-ROM version of a Japanese-
English dictionary containing 40 thousands entries.
Statistics repeats the iteration by using statistical
corresponding words only. This is identical to Kay&apos;s
method (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) except for the
statistics used. Dictionary performs the iteration
of the algorithm by using corresponding words of
the bilingual dictionary. This delineates the cover-
age of the dictionary. The parameter setting used
for each method was the optimum as determined by
empirical tests.
In Table 3, PRECISION delineates how many of
the aligned pairs are correct and RECALL delineates
how many of the manual alignments we included
in systems output. Unlike conventional sentence-
chunk based evaluations, our result is measured on
the sentence-sentence basis. Let us consider a 3-1
matching. Although conventional evaluations can
make only one error from the chunk, three errors
may arise by our evaluation. Note that our evalua-
tion is more strict than the conventional one, espe-
cially for difficult texts, because they contain more
complex matches.
For Text 1 and Text 2, both the combined
method and the dictionary method perform much
better than the statistical method. This is ob-
viously because statistics cannot capture word-
correspondences in the case of short texts.
Text 3 is easy to align in terms of both the com-
plexity of the alignment and the vocabularies used.

that Text 4 concerns brain science and the bilingual
dictionaries of general use did not contain domain
specific keywords. On the other hand, the combined
and statistical methods well capture the keywords
as described in the next section. Note here that
Combined performs better than Statistics in the
case of longer texts, too. There is clearly a limitation
in the amount of word correspondences that can be
captured by statistics. In summary, the performance
of Combined is better than either Statistics or
Dictionary for all texts, regardless of text length
and the domain.

4.2 Word Correspondence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999602027777778">
In this section, we will demonstrate how well the pro-
posed method captured domain specific word corre-
spondences by using Text 4 as an example. Table 4
shows the word correspondences that have high mu-
tual information. These are typical keywords con-
cerning the non-invasive approach to human brain
analysis. For example, NMR, MEG, PET, CT, MRI
and functional MRI are devices for measuring brain
activity from outside the head. These technical
terms are the subjects of the text and are essential
for alignment. However, none of them have their
own entry in the bilingual dictionary, which would
strongly obstruct the dictionary method.
It is interesting to note that the correct Japanese
translation of &apos;MEG&apos; is &apos; fg&apos;. The Japanese mor-
phological analyzer we used does not contain an en-
try for &apos; and split it into a sequence of three
characters &apos; and &apos; El&apos;. Our system skillfully
combined &apos; and &apos; gp with &apos;MEG&apos;, as a result of
statistical acquisition. These word correspondences
greatly improved the performance for Text 4. Thus,
the statistical method well captures the domain spe-
cific keywords that are not included in general-use
bilingual dictionaries. The dictionary method would
yield false alignments if statistically acquired word
correspondences were not used.
Although these word correspondences are very ef-
fective for sentence alignment task, they are unsat-
isfactory when regarded as a bilingual dictionary.
For example, &apos; 7 7 V IV a *A-MR I&apos; in Japanese
is the translation of &apos;functional MRI&apos;. In Table 4, the
correspondence of these compound nouns was cap-
tured only in their constituent level. (Haruno et al.,
1996) proposes an efficient n-gram based method to
extract bilingual collocations from sentence aligned
bilingual corpora.

Sentence alignment between Japanese and English
was first explored by Sato and Murao (Murao, 1991).
They found (character or word) length-based ap-
proaches were not appropriate due to the structural
difference of the two languages. They devised a
dynamic programming method based on the num-
ber of corresponding words in a hand-crafted bilin-
gual dictionary. Although some results were promis-
ing, the method&apos;s performance strongly depended on
the domain of the texts and the dictionary entries.
(Utsuro et al., 1994) introduced a statistical post-
processing step to tackle the problem. He first ap-
plied Sato&apos;s method and extracted statistical word
correspondences from the result of the first path.
Sato&apos;s method was then reiterated using both the ac-
quired word correspondences and the hand-crafted
dictionary. His method involves the following two
problems. First, unless the hand-crafted dictionary
contains domain specific key words, the first path
yields false alignment, which in turn leads to false
statistical correspondences. Because it is impossible
in general to cover key words in all domains, it is
inevitable that statistics and hand-crafted bilingual
dictionaries must be used at the same time.

The proposed method involves iterative alignment
which simultaneously uses both statistics and a
bilingual dictionary.
Second, their score function is not reliable espe-
cially when the number of corresponding words con-
tained in corresponding sentences is small. Their
method selects a matching type (such as 1-1, 1-2
and 2-1) according to the number of word correspon-
dences per contents word. However, in many cases,
there are a few word translations in a set of corre-
sponding sentences. Thus, it is essential to decide
sentence alignment on the sentence-sentence basis.
Our iterative approach decides sentence alignment
level by level by counting the word correspondences
between a Japanese and an English sentence.
(Fung and Church, 1994; Fung, 1995) proposed
methods to find Chinese-English word correspon-
dences without aligning parallel texts. Their mo-
tivation is that structurally different languages such
as Chinese-English and Japanese-English are diffi-
cult to align in general. Their methods bypassed
aligning sentences and directly acquired word cor-
respondences. Although their approaches are ro-
bust for noisy corpora and do not require any in-
formation source, aligned sentences are necessary
for higher level applications such as well-grained
translatiOn template acquisition (Matsumoto et al.,
1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Haruno et al., 1996)
and example-based translation (Sato and Nagao,
1990). Our method performs accurate alignment for
such use by combining the detailed word correspon-
dences: statistically acquired word correspondences
and those from a bilingual dictionary of general use.
(Church, 1993) proposed char_align that makes
use of n-grams shared by two languages. This
kind of matching techniques will be helpful in our
dictionary-based approach in the following situation:
Entries of a bilingual dictionary do not completely
match the word in the corpus but partially do. By
using the matching technique, we can make the most
of the information compiled in bilingual dictionaries.

We have described a text alignment method for
structurally different languages. Our iterative
method uses two kinds of word correspondences at
the same time: word correspondences acquired by
statistics and those of a bilingual dictionary. By
combining these two types of word correspondences,
the method covers both domain specific keywords
not included in the dictionary and the infrequent
words not detected by statistics. As a result, our
method outperforms conventional methods for texts
of different lengths and different domains.

<abstract confidence="0.997419692307692">This paper describes an accurate and text alignment system for structurally different languages. Among structurally different languages such as Japanese and English, there is a limitation on the amount of word correspondences that can be statistically acquired. The proposed method makes use of two kinds of word correspondences in aligning bilingual texts. One is a bilingual dictionary of general use. The other is the word correspondences that are statistically acquired in the alignment process. Our method gradually determines sentence pairs (anchors) that correspond to each other by relaxing parameters. The method, by combining two kinds of word correspondences, achieves adequate word correspondences for complete alignment. As a result, texts of various length and of various genres in structurally different languages can be aligned with high precision. Experimental results show our system outperforms conventional methods for various kinds of Japanese-English texts.</abstract>

The number of confident word correspondences of words is not enough for complete alignment. Thus, the problem cannot be addressed as long as the method relies only on statistics.

Bilingual dictionaries are now widely available on-line due to advances in CD-ROM technologies.

Most of these works assume voluminous aligned corpora. Many methods have been proposed to align bilingual corpora. One of the major approaches is based on the statistics of simple features such as sentence length in words (Brown and others, 1991) or in characters (Gale and Church, 1993). These techniques are widely used because they can be implemented in an efficient and simple way through dynamic programing. However, their main targets are rigid translations that are almost literal translations. In addition, the texts being aligned were structurally similar European languages (i.e., English-French, English-German). The simple-feature based approaches don&apos;t work in flexible translations for structurally different languages such as Japanese and English, mainly for the following two reasons. One is the difference in the character types of the two languages. Japanese has three </context>
<context position="3367" citStr="Church, 1993" startWordPosition="499" endWordPosition="500">ages. First, the systems of functional (closed) words are quite different from language to language. Japanese has a quite different system of closed words, which greatly influence the length of simple features. Second, due to rhetorical difference, the number of multiple match (i.e., 1-2, 1-3, 2-1 and so on) is more than that among European languages. Thus, it is impossible in general to apply the simple-feature based methods to Japanese-English translations. One alternative alignment method is the lexiconbased approach that makes use of the wordcorrespondence knowledge of the two languages. (Church, 1993) employed n-grams shared by two languages. His method is also effective for JapaneseEnglish computer manuals both containing lots of the same alphabetic technical terms. However, the method cannot be applied to general translations in structurally different languages. (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) proposed a relaxation method to iteratively align bilingual texts using the word correspondences acquired during the alignment process. Although the method works well among European languages, the method does not work in aligning structurally different languages. In JapaneseEnglish translations, the met</context>

Our evaluation focuses on much smaller texts than those used in other study(Brown and others, 1993; Gale and Church, 1993; Wu, 1994; Fung, 1995; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) because our main targets are well-separated articles. However, our method will work on larger and noisy sets too, by using word anchors rather than using sentence boundaries as segment boundaries. In such a case, the method constructing initial ASM needs to be modified. We briefly report here the computation time of our method. Let us consider Text 4 as an example. After 15 seconds for full preprocessing, the first iteration took 25 seconds with t10„ = 1.55 and hoev = 1.8. The rest of the algorithm took 20 seconds in all. This experiment was pe</context>

Thus, the statistical method well captures the domain specific keywords that are not included in general-use bilingual dictionaries. The dictionary method would yield false alignments if statistically acquired word correspondences were not used. Although these word correspondences are very effective for sentence alignment task, they are unsatisfactory when regarded as a bilingual dictionary. For example, &apos; 7 7 V IV a *A-MR I&apos; in Japanese is the translation of &apos;functional MRI&apos;. In Table 4, the correspondence of these compound nouns was captured only in their constituent level. (Haruno et al., 1996) proposes an efficient n-gram based method to extract bilingual collocations from sentence aligned bilingual corpora. 5 Related Work Sentence alignment between Japanese and English was first explored by Sato and Murao (Murao, 1991). They found (character or word) length-based approaches were not appropriate due to the structural difference of the two languages. They devised a dynamic programming method based on the number of corresponding words in a hand-crafted bilingual dictionary. Although some results were promising, the method&apos;s performance strongly depended on the domain of the texts and</context>

Thus, it is impossible in general to apply the simple-feature based methods to Japanese-English translations. One alternative alignment method is the lexiconbased approach that makes use of the wordcorrespondence knowledge of the two languages. (Church, 1993) employed n-grams shared by two languages. His method is also effective for JapaneseEnglish computer manuals both containing lots of the same alphabetic technical terms. However, the method cannot be applied to general translations in structurally different languages. (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) proposed a relaxation method to iteratively align bilingual texts using the word correspondences acquired during the alignment process. Although the method works well among European languages, the method does not work in aligning structurally different languages. In JapaneseEnglish translations, the method does not capture enough word correspondences to permit alignment. As a result, it can align only some of the two texts. This is mainly because the syntax and rhetoric are 131 greatly differ in the two languages even in literal translations. The number of confident word correspondences of wo</context>

From many similarity metrics applicable to the task, we choose mutual information and t-score because the relaxation of parameters can be controlled in a sophisticated manner. Mutual information represents the similarity on the occurrence distribution and t-score represents the confidence of the similarity. These two parameters permit more effective relaxation than the single parameter used in conventional methods(Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). Our basic data structure is the alignable sentence matrix (ASM) and the anchor matrix (AM). ASM represents possible sentence correspondences and consists of ones and zeros. A one in ASM indicates the intersection of the column and row constitutes a possible sentence correspondence. On the contrary, AM is introduced to represent how a sentence pair is supported by word correspondences. The i-j Element of AM indicates how many times the corresponding words appear in the i-j sentence pair. As alignment proceeds, the number of ones in ASM reduces, while the elements of AM increase. Let pi be a s</context>
<context position="15048" citStr="Kay and Roscheisen, 1993" startWordPosition="2329" endWordPosition="2332">s using article boundaries, section boundaries and so on. In the most general case, initial anchors are the first and last sentences of both texts as depicted in Figure 2. Next, possible sentence correspondences are generated. Intuitively, true correspondences are close to the diagonal linking the two anchors. We construct the initial ASM using such a function that pairs sentences near the middle of the two anchors with as many as 0(NYL) (L is the number of sentences existing between two anchors) sentences in the other text because the maximum deviation can be stochastically modeled as O(rL) (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). The initial ASM has little effect on the alignment performance so long as it contains all correct sentence correspondences. 3.2.2 Constructing AM This step constructs an AM when given an ASM and a bilingual dictionary. Let thigh, tlow -Thigh and ho„ be two thresholds for t-score and two thresholds for mutual information, respectively. Let ANC be the minimal number of corresponding words for a sentence pair to be judged as an anchor. First, mutual information and t-score are computed for all word pairs appearing in a possible sentence correspondence in ASM. We use hereafter the word correspon</context>

(Haruno et al., 1996) proposes an efficient n-gram based method to extract bilingual collocations from sentence aligned bilingual corpora. 5 Related Work Sentence alignment between Japanese and English was first explored by Sato and Murao (Murao, 1991). They found (character or word) length-based approaches were not appropriate due to the structural difference of the two languages. They devised a dynamic programming method based on the number of corresponding words in a hand-crafted bilingual dictionary. Although some results were promising, the method&apos;s performance strongly depended on the domain of the texts and the dictionary entries. (Utsuro et al., 1994) introduced a statistical postprocessing step to tackle the problem. He first applied Sato&apos;s method and extracted statistical word correspondences from the result of the first path. Sat</context>

As a result, texts of various length and of various genres in structurally different languages can be aligned with high precision. Experimental results show our system outperforms conventional methods for various kinds of Japanese-English texts. 1 Introduction Corpus-based approaches based on bilingual texts are promising for various applications(i.e., lexical knowledge extraction (Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Dagan and Church, 1994; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Haruno et al., 1996), machine translation (Brown and others, 1993; Sato and Nagao, 1990; Kaji et al., 1992) and information retrieval (Sato, 1992)). Most of these works assume voluminous aligned corpora. Many methods have been proposed to align bilingual corpora. One of the major approaches is based on the statistics of simple features such as sentence length in words (Brown and others, 1991) or in characters (Gale and Church, 1993). These techniques are widely used because they can be implemented in an efficient and simple way through dynamic programing. However, their main targets are rigid translations that are almost literal translations. In addition, the texts being aligned</context>

Their motivation is that structurally different languages such as Chinese-English and Japanese-English are difficult to align in general. Their methods bypassed aligning sentences and directly acquired word correspondences. Although their approaches are robust for noisy corpora and do not require any information source, aligned sentences are necessary for higher level applications such as well-grained translatiOn template acquisition (Matsumoto et al., 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Haruno et al., 1996) and example-based translation (Sato and Nagao, 1990). Our method performs accurate alignment for such use by combining the detailed word correspondences: statistically acquired word correspondences and those from a bilingual dictionary of general use.

First, unless the hand-crafted dictionary contains domain specific key words, the first path yields false alignment, which in turn leads to false statistical correspondences.
