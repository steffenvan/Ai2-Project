Manual evaluation of translation quality is
generally thought to be excessively time
consuming and expensive. We explore a
fast and inexpensive way of doing it using
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to pay small
sums to a large number of non-expert an-
notators. For $10 we redundantly recre-
ate judgments from a WMT08 transla-
tion task. We find that when combined
non-expert judgments have a high-level of
agreement with the existing gold-standard
judgments of machine translation quality,
and correlate more strongly with expert
judgments than Bleu does. We go on to
show that Mechanical Turk can be used to
calculate human-mediated translation edit
rate (HTER), to conduct reading compre-
hension experiments with machine trans-
lation, and to create high quality reference
translations.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999038">
Conventional wisdom holds that manual evalua-
tion of machine translation is too time-consuming
and expensive to conduct. Instead, researchers
routinely use automatic metrics like Bleu (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002) as the sole evidence of im-
provement to translation quality. Automatic met-
rics have been criticized for a variety of reasons
(Babych and Hartley, 2004; Callison-Burch et al.,
2006; Chiang et al., 2008), and it is clear that
they only loosely approximate human judgments.
Therefore, having people evaluate translation out-
put would be preferable, if it were more practical.
In this paper we demonstrate that the manual
evaluation of translation quality is not as expensive
or as time consuming as generally thought. We
use Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, an online labor
market that is designed to pay people small sums
of money to complete human intelligence tests –
tasks that are difficult for computers but easy for
people. We show that:

<listItem confidence="0.999319">
• Non-expert annotators produce judgments
that are very similar to experts and that have
a stronger correlation than Bleu.
• Mechanical Turk can be used for complex
tasks like human-mediated translation edit
rate (HTER) and creating multiple reference
translations.
• Evaluating translation quality through read-
ing comprehension, which is rarely done, can
be easily accomplished through creative use
of Mechanical Turk.

Snow et al. (2008) examined the accuracy of la-
bels created using Mechanical Turk for a variety
of natural language processing tasks. These tasks
included word sense disambiguation, word simi-
larity, textual entailment, and temporal ordering
of events, but not machine translation. Snow et
al. measured the quality of non-expert annotations
by comparing them against labels that had been
previously created by expert annotators. They re-
port inter-annotator agreement between expert and
non-expert annotators, and show that the average
of many non-experts converges on performance of
a single expert for many of their tasks.
Although it is not common for manual evalu-
ation results to be reported in conference papers,
several large-scale manual evaluations of machine
translation quality take place annually. These in-

Amazon describes its Mechanical Turk web ser-
vice1 as artificial artificial intelligence. The name
and tag line refer to a historical hoax from the 18th
century where an automaton appeared to be able to
beat human opponents at chess using a clockwork
mechanism, but was, in fact, controlled by a per-
son hiding inside the machine. The Mechanical
Turk web site provides a way to pay people small
amounts of money to perform tasks that are sim-
ple for humans but difficult for computers. Exam-
ples of these Human Intelligence Tasks (or HITs)
range from labeling images to moderating blog
comments to providing feedback on relevance of
results for a search query.
Anyone with an Amazon account can either
submit HITs or work on HITs that were submit-
ted by others. Workers are sometimes referred to
as “Turkers” and people designing the HITs are
“Requesters.” Requesters can specify the amount
that they will pay for each item that is completed.
Payments are frequently as low as $0.01. Turkers
are free to select whichever HITs interest them.
Amazon provides three mechanisms to help en-
sure quality: First, Requesters can have each HIT
be completed by multiple Turkers, which allows
higher quality labels to be selected, for instance,
by taking the majority label. Second, the Re-
quester can require that all workers meet a particu-
lar set of qualications, such as sufficient accuracy
on a small test set or a minimum percentage of
previously accepted submissions. Finally, the Re-
quester has the option of rejecting the work of in-
dividual workers, in which case they are not paid.
The level of good-faith participation by Turkers
is surprisingly high, given the generally small na-
ture of the payment.2 For complex undertakings
like creating data for NLP tasks, Turkers do not

We use Mechanical Turk as an inexpensive way
of evaluating machine translation. In this section,
we measure the level of agreement between ex-
pert and non-expert judgments of translation qual-
ity. To do so, we recreate an existing set of gold-
standard judgments of machine translation quality
taken from the Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT), which conducts an annual
large-scale human evaluation of machine transla-
tion quality. The experts who produced the gold-
standard judgments are computational linguists
who develop machine translation systems.
We recreated all judgments from the WMT08
German-English News translation task. The out-
put of the 11 different machine translation systems
that participated in this task was scored by ranking
translated sentences relative to each other. To col-
lect judgements, we reproduced the WMT08 web
interface in Mechanical Turk and provided these
instructions:
Evaluate machine translation quality Rank each transla-
tion from Best to Worst relative to the other choices (ties are
allowed). If you do not know the source language then you
can read the reference translation, which was created by a
professional human translator.
The web interface displaced 5 different machine
translations of the same source sentence, and had
radio buttons to rate them.
Turkers were paid a grand total of $9.75 to
complete nearly 1,000 HITs. These HITs ex-
actly replicated the 200 screens worth of expert
judgments that were collected for the WMT08
German-English News translation task, with each
screen being completed by five different Turkers.
The Turkers were shown a source sentence, a ref-
erence translation, and translations from five MT
systems. They were asked to rank the translations
relative to each other, assigning scores from best
to worst and allowing ties.
We evaluate non-expert Turker judges by mea-
suring their inter-annotator agreement with the
WMT08 expert judges, and by comparing the cor-
relation coefficient across the rankings of the ma-
chine translation systems produced by the two sets
of judges.

ber of HITs they completed. The figure shows
that their agreement varies considerably, and that
Turker who completed the most judgments was
among the worst performing.
To avoid letting careless annotators drag down
results, we experimented with weighted voting.
We weighted votes in two ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.695026428571429">
• Votes were weighted by measuring agree-
ment with experts on the 10 initial judgments
made. This would be equivalent to giving
Turkers a pretest on gold standard data and
then calibrating their contribution based on
how well they performed.
• Votes were weighted based on how often one

Turker agreed with the rest of the Turkers
over the whole data set. This does not re-
quire any gold standard calibration data. It
goes beyond simple voting, because it looks
at a Turker’s performance over the entire set,
rather than on an item-by-item basis.
Figure 1 shows that these weighting mechanisms
perform similarly well. For this task, deriving
weights from agreement with other non-experts
is as effective as deriving weights from experts.

we are able to achieve the same rate of agreement
with experts as they achieve with each other.
Correlation when ranking systems In addi-
tion to measuring agreement with experts at
the sentence-level, we also compare non-expert
system-level rankings with experts. Following
Callison-Burch et al. (2008), we assigned a score
to each of the 11 MT systems based on how of-
ten its translations were judged to be better than or
equal to any other system. These scores were used
to rank systems and we measured Spearman’s ρ
against the system-level ranking produced by ex-
perts.
Figure 3 shows how well the non-expert rank-
ings correlate with expert rankings. An up-
per bound is indicated by the expert-expert bar.
This was created using a five-fold cross valida-
tion where we used 20% of the expert judgments
to rank the systems and measured the correlation
against the rankings produced by the other 80%
of the judgments. This gave a ρ of 0.78. All ways
of combining the non-expert judgments resulted in
nearly identical correlation, and all produced cor-
relation within the range of with what we would
experts to.
The rankings produced using Mechanical Turk
had a much stronger correlation with the WMT08
expert rankings than the Blue score did. It should
be noted that the WMT08 data set does not have
multiple reference translations. If multiple ref-
erences were used that Bleu would likely have
stronger correlation. However, it is clear that the
cost of hiring professional translators to create
multiple references for the 2000 sentence test set
would be much greater than the $10 cost of col-
lecting manual judgments on Mechanical Turk.

In this section we report on a number of cre-

In addition to evaluating machine translation qual-

Mechanical Turk to create additional reference
translations for use with automatic metrics like
Bleu. Before trying this, we were skeptical that
Turkers would have sufficient language skills to
produce translations. Our translation HIT had the
following instructions:

Quality of Turkers’ translations Our 50 sen-
tence test sets were selected so that we could com-
pare the translations created by Turkers to transla-
tions commissioned by the Linguistics Data Con-
sortium. For the Chinese, French, Spanish, and
German translations we used the the Multiple-
Translation Chinese Corpus.3 This corpus has
11 reference human translations for each Chinese
source sentence. We had bilingual graduate stu-
dents translate the first 50 English sentences of
that corpus into French, German and Spanish, so
that we could re-use the multiple English reference
translations. The Urdu sentences were taken from
the NIST MT Eval 2008 Urdu-English Test Set4

for every Urdu source sentence.

the Bleu score would be for a professional trans-

We calculated a Bleu score for each of the 11
LDC translators using the other 10 translators as
the reference set. The average Bleu score for
LDC2002T01 was 0.54, with a standard deviation
of 0.07. The average Bleu for the Urdu test set is
lower because it has fewer reference translations.
To measure the Turkers’ translation quality, we
randomly selected translations of each sentence
from Turkers who passed the Detect MT HIT, and
compared them against the same sets of 10 ref-
erence translations that the LDC translators were
compared against. We randomly sampled the
Turkers 10 times, and calculated averages and

Cost and speed We paid Turkers $0.10 to trans-
late each sentence, and $0.006 to detect whether a
sentence was machine translated. The cost is low
enough that we could create a multiple reference
set quite cheaply; it would cost less than $1,000 to
create 4 reference translations for 2000 sentences.
The time it took for the 250 translations to be
completed for each language varied. It took less
than 4 hours for Spanish, 20 hours for French, 22.5
hours for German, 2 days for Chinese, and nearly
4 days for Urdu.

Go” determinant of whether teams will continue
to receive funding. Thus, each team have a strong
incentive to get as good a result as possible under
the metric.
Each of the three GALE teams encompasses
multiple sites and each has a collection of ma-
chine translation systems. A general strategy em-
ployed by all teams is to perform system combi-
nation over these systems to produce a synthetic
translation that is better than the sum of its parts
(Matusov et al., 2006; Rosti et al., 2007). The con-
tribution of each component system is weighted
by the expectation that it will produce good out-
put. To our knowledge, none of the teams perform
their own HTER evaluations in order to set these
weights.
We evaluated the feasibility of using Mechan-
ical Turk to perform HTER. We simplified the
official GALE post-editing guidelines (NIST and
LDC, 2007). We provided these instructions:
Edit Machine Translation Your task is to edit the machine
translation making as few changes as possible so that it
matches the meaning of the human translation and is good
English. Please follow these guidelines:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994090875">
• Change the machine translation so that it has the same
meaning as the human translation.
• Make the machine translation into intelligible English.
• Use as few edits as possible.
• Do not insert or delete punctuation simply to follow
traditional rules about what is “proper.”
• Please do not copy-and-paste the human translation
into the machine translation.

edit rate decreases as the number of editors in-
creases from zero (where HTER is simply the TER
score between the MT output and the reference
translation) and five.
We displayed 10 sentences from a news article. In
one column was the reference English translation,
in the other column were text boxes containing
the MT output to be edited. To minimize the edit
rate, we collected edits from five different Turkers
for every machine translated segment. We verified
these with a second HIT were we prompted Turk-
ers to:

<footnote confidence="0.915197857142857">
Judge edited translations First, read the reference human
translation. After that judge the edited machine translation
using two criteria:
9 Does the edited translation have the same meaning as
the reference human translation?
9 Is it acceptable English? Some small errors are OK, so
long as its still understandable.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993575862069">
For the final score, we choose the edited segment
which passed the criteria and which minimized the
edit distance to the unedited machine translation
output. If none of the five edits was deemed to be
acceptable, then we used the edit distance between
the MT and the reference.
Setup We evaluated five machine translation
systems using HTER. These systems were se-
lected from WMT09 (Callison-Burch et al., 2009).
We wanted a spread in quality, so we took the top
two and bottom two systems from the German-
English task, and the top system from the French-
English task (which significantly outperformed
everything else). Based on the results of the
WMT09 evaluation we would expect the see the
following ranking from the least edits to the most
edits: google.fr-en, google.de-en, rbmt5.de-en,
geneva.de-en and tromble.de-en.
Results Table 2 gives the HTER scores for the
five systems. Their ranking is as predicted, indi-
cating that the editing is working as expected. The
table reports averaged scores when the five anno-
tators are subsampled. This gives a sense of how
much each additional editor is able to minimize
the score for each system. The difference between
the TER score with zero editors, and the HTER
five editors is greatest for the rmbt5 system, which
has a delta of .29 and is smallest for jhu-tromble
with .07.

5.3 Reading comprehension
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974972972973">
One interesting technique for evaluating machine
translation quality is through reading comprehen-
sion questions about automatically translated text.
The quality of machine translation systems can be
quantified based on how many questions are an-
swered correctly.
Jones et al. (2005) evaluated translation quality
using a reading comprehension test the Defense
Language Proficiency Test (DLPT), which is ad-
ministered to military translators. The DLPT con-
tains a collection of foreign articles of varying lev-
els of difficulties, and a set of short answer ques-
tions. Jones et al used the Arabic DLPT to do a
study of machine translation quality, by automat-
ically translating the Arabic documents into En-
glish and seeing how many human subjects could
successfully pass the exam.
The advantage of this type of evaluation is that
the results have a natural interpretation. They indi-
cate how understandable the output of a machine
translation system is better than Bleu does, and
better than other manual evaluation like the rela-
tive ranking. Despite this advantage, evaluating
MT through reading comprehension hasn’t caught
on, due to the difficulty of administering it and due
to the fact that the DLPT or similar tests are not
publicly available.
We conducted a reading comprehension evalua-
tion using Mechanical Turk. Instead of simply ad-
ministering the test on Mechanical Turk, we used
it for all aspects from test creation to answer grad-
ing. Our procedure was as follows:
Test creation We posted human translations of
foreign news articles, and ask Tukers to write three
questions and provide sample answers. We gave
simple instructions on what qualifies as a good
reading comprehension question.

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.994609785714286">
Question selection We posted the questions for
each article back to Mechanical Turk, and asked
other Turkers to vote on whether each question
was a good and to indicate if it was redundant with
any other questions in the set. We sorted questions
to maximize the votes and minimized redundan-
cies using a simple perl script, which discarded
questions below a threshold, and eliminated all re-
dundancies.
Taking the test We posted machine translated
versions of the foreign articles along with the
questions, and had Turkers answer them. We en-
sured that no one would see multiple translations
of the same article.

<construct confidence="0.779286846153846">
Answer questions about a machine translated text You will
answer questions about an article that has been automat-
ically translated from another language into English. The
translation contains many errors, but the goal is to see how
understandable it is. Please do your best to guess at the right
answers to the questions. Please:
9 Read through the automatically translated article.
9 Answer the questions listed below, using just a few
words.
9 Give your best guess at the answers, even if the trans-

Grading the answers We aggregated the
answers and used Mechanical Turk to grade
them. We showed the human translation of the
article, one question, the sample answer, and
displayed all answers to it. After the Turkers
graded the answers, we calculated the percentage
of questions that were answered correctly for each
system.
Turkers created 90 questions for 10 articles, which
were subsequently filtered down to 47 good ques-
tions, ranging from 3–6 questions per article. 25
Turkers answered questions about each translated
article. To avoid them answering the questions
multiple times, we randomly selected which sys-
tem’s translation was shown to them. Each sys-

based on the HTER scores and on the human eval-

helps to validate that the reading comprehension
methodology. The scores are more interpretable
than Blue scores and than the WMT09 relative

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933136363636">
Mechanical Turk is an inexpensive way of gather-
ing human judgments and annotations for a wide
variety of tasks. In this paper we demonstrate
that it is feasible to perform manual evaluations
of machine translation quality using the web ser-
vice. The low cost of the non-expert labor found
on Mechanical Turk is cheap enough to collect re-
dundant annotations, which can be utilized to en-
sure translation quality. By combining the judg-
ments of many non-experts we are able to achieve
the equivalent quality of experts.
The suggests that manual evaluation of trans-
lation quality could be straightforwardly done to
validate performance improvements reported in
conference papers, or even for mundane tasks
like tracking incremental system updates. This
challenges the conventional wisdom which has
long held that automatic metrics must be used
since manual evaluation is too costly and time-
consuming.
We have shown that Mechanical Turk can be
used creatively to produce quite interesting things.

We showed how a reading comprehension test
could be created, administered, and graded, with
only very minimal intervention.
We believe that it is feasible to use Mechanical
Turk for a wide variety of other machine translated
tasks like creating word alignments for sentence
pairs, verifying the accuracy of document- and
sentence-alignments, performing non-simulated
active learning experiments for statistical machine
translation, even collecting training data for low
resource languages like Urdu.
The cost of using Mechanical Turk is low
enough that we might consider attempting
quixotic things like human-in-the-loop minimum
error rate training (Zaidan and Callison-Burch,
2009), or doubling the amount of training data
available for Urdu.

Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the
influence of drugs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980549866666667">
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda on the popular se-
ries Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bar-
bara (California) after driving under the influence of drugs. A
witness saw her performing inappropriate maneuvers while
trying to take her car out of a parking space in Montecito, as
revealed to People magazine by a spokesman for the Califor-
nian Highway Police. The witness stated that around 4.30pm
Ms. Locklear “hit the accelerator very roughly, making ex-
cessive noise and trying to take the car out from the park-
ing space with abrupt back and forth maneuvers. While re-
versing, she passed several times in front of his sunglasses.”
Shortly after, the witness, who at first, apparently had not rec-
ognized the actress, saw Ms. Locklear stopping in a nearby
street and leaving the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, be-
cause “he was concerned about Ms. Locklear’s life.” When
the patrol arrived, the police found the actress sitting inside
her car, which was partially blocking the road. “She seemed
confused,” so the policemen took her to a specialized centre
for drugs and alcohol and submitted her a test. According to a
spokesman for the police, the actress was cooperative and ex-
cessive alcohol was ruled out from the beginning, even if “as
the officers initially observed, we believe Ms. Locklear was
under the influences drugs.” Ms. Locklear was arrested under
suspicion of driving under the influence of some - unspecified
substance, and imprisoned in the local jail at 7.00pm, to be re-
leased some hours later. Two months ago, Ms. Locklear was
released from a specialist clinic in Arizona where she was
treated after an episode of anxiety and depression.
4 questions were selected

We explore a fast and inexpensive way of doing it using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to pay small sums to a large number of non-expert annotators. For $10 we redundantly recreate judgments from a WMT08 translation task. We find that when combined non-expert judgments have a high-level of agreement with the existing gold-standard judgments of machine translation quality, and correlate more strongly with expert judgments than Bleu does.

Based on the results of the WMT09 evaluation we would expect the see the following ranking from the least edits to the most edits: google.fr-en, google.de-en, rbmt5.de-en, geneva.de-en and tromble.de-en.

Instead, researchers routinely use automatic metrics like Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) as the sole evidence of improvement to translation quality. Automatic metrics have been criticized for a variety of reasons (Babych and Hartley, 2004; Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Chiang et al., 2008), and it is clear that they only loosely approximate human judgments. Therefore, having people evaluate translation output would be preferable, if it were more practical. In this paper we demonstrate that the manual evaluation of translation quality is not as expensive or as time consuming as generally thought. We use Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, an online labor market that is designed to pay people small sums of money to complete human intelligence tests – tasks that are difficult for computers but easy for people.

This gives a sense of how much each additional editor is able to minimize the score for each system. The difference between the TER score with zero editors, and the HTER five editors is greatest for the rmbt5 system, which has a delta of .29 and is smallest for jhu-tromble with .07. 5.3 Reading comprehension One interesting technique for evaluating machine translation quality is through reading comprehension questions about automatically translated text. The quality of machine translation systems can be quantified based on how many questions are answered correctly. Jones et al. (2005) evaluated translation quality using a reading comprehension test the Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT), which is administered to military translators. The DLPT contains a collection of foreign articles of varying levels of difficulties, and a set of short answer questions. Jones et al used the Arabic DLPT to do a study of machine translation quality, by automatically translating the Arabic documents into English and seeing how many human subjects could successfully pass the exam. The advantage of this type of evaluation is that the results have a natural interpretation. They indicate h</context>
