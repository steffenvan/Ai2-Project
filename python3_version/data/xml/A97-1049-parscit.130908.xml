In this paper, we describe our multilingual
(or cross-linguistic) information browsing
and retrieval system, which is aimed at
monolingual users who are interested in in-
formation from multiple language sources.
The system takes advantage of information
extraction (IE) technology in novel ways
to improve the accuracy of cross-linguistic
retrieval and to provide innovative meth-
ods for browsing and exploring multilin-
gual document collections. The system in-
dexes texts in different languages (e.g., En-
glish and Japanese) and allows the users to
retrieve relevant texts in their native lan-
guage (e.g., English). The retrieved text
is then presented to the users with proper
names and specialized domain terms trans-
lated and hyperlinked. Moreover, the sys-
tem allows interactive information discov-
ery from a multilingual document collec-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99996475">
More and more multilingual information is available
on-line every day. The World Wide Web (WWW),
for example, is becoming a vast depository of mul-
tilingual information. However, monolingual users
can currently access information only in their na-
tive language. For example, it is not easy for a
monolingual English speaker to locate necessary in-
formation written in Japanese. The users would not
know the query terms in Japanese even if the search
engine accepts Japanese queries. In addition, even
when the users locate a possibly relevant text in
Japanese, they will have little idea about what is
in the text. Outputs of off-the-shelf machine trans-
lation (MT) systems are often of low-quality, and
even &amp;quot;high-end&amp;quot; MT systems have problems partic-
ularly in translating proper names and specialized
domain terms, which often contain the most critical
information to the users.
In this paper, we describe our multilingual (or
cross-linguistic) information browsing and retrieval
system, which is aimed at monolingual users who
are interested in information from multiple language
sources. The system takes advantage of information
extraction (IE) technology in novel ways to improve
the accuracy of cross-linguistic retrieval and to pro-
vide innovative methods for browsing and exploring
multilingual document collections. The system in-
dexes texts in different languages (e.g., English and
Japanese) and allows the users to retrieve relevant
texts in their native language (e.g., English). The
retrieved text is then presented to the users with
proper names and specialized domain terms trans-
lated and hyperlinked. The system also allows the
user in their native language to browse and discover
information buried in the database derived from the
entire document collection.

2 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999227739130435">
The system consists of the Indexing Module, the
Client Module, the Term Translation Module, and
the Web Crawler. The Indexing Module creates and
loads indices into a database while the Client Module
allows browsing and retrieval of information in the
database through a Web browser-based graphical
user interface (GUI). The Term Translation Mod-
ule is bi-directional; it dynamically translates user
queries into target foreign languages and the indexed
terms in retrieved documents into the user&apos;s native
language. The Web Crawler can be used to add tex-
tual information from the WWW; it fetches pages
from user-specified Web sites at specified intervals,
and queues them up for the Indexing Module to in-
gest regularly.
For our current application, the system indexes
names of people, entities, and locations, and scien-
tific and technical (S&amp;T) terms in both English and
Japanese texts, and allows the user to query and
browse the database in English. When Japanese
texts are retrieved, indexed terms are translated into
English.
This system is designed to expand to other lan-

guages besides English and Japanese and other do-
mains beyond S&amp;T terms. Moreover, the English-
centric browsing and retrieval mode can be switched
according to the users&apos; language preference so that,
for example, a Japanese user can query and browse
English documents in Japanese.

2.1 The Intelligent Indexing Module
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999759283783784">
The Indexing Module indexes names of people, enti-
ties, and locations and a list of scientific and techni-
cal (S&amp;T) terms using state-of-the-art IE technol-
ogy. It uses different configurations of the same
fast indexing engine called NameTagTm for differ-
ent languages. Two separate configurations (&amp;quot;index-
ing servers&amp;quot;) are used for English and Japanese, and
how the English and Japanese indexing servers work
is described in (Krupka, 1995; Aone, 1996).
In the Sixth Message Understanding Conference
(MUC-6), the English system was benchmarked
against the Wall Street Journal blind test set for
the name tagging task, and achieved a 96% F-
measure, which is a combination of recall and preci-
sion measures (Adv, 1995),. Our internal testing
of the Japanese system against blind test sets of
various Japanese newspaper articles indicates that
it achieves from high-80 to low-90% accuracy, de-
pending on the types of corpora. Indexing names
in Japanese texts is usually more challenging than
English for two main reasons. First, there is no case
distinction in Japanese, whereas English names in
newspapers are capitalized, and capitalization is a
very strong clue for English name tagging. Sec-
ond, Japanese words are not separated by spaces and
therefore must be segmented into separate words be-
fore the name tagging process. As segmentation is
not 100% accurate, segmentation errors can some-
times cause name tagging rules not to fire or to mis-
fire.
Indexing of names is particularly useful in the
Japanese case as it can improve overall segmenta-
tion and thus indexing accuracy. In English, since
words are separated by spaces, there is no issue of in-
dexing accuracy for individual words. On the other
hand, in languages like Japanese, where word bound-
aries are not explicitly marked by spaces, indexing
accuracy of individual words depends on accuracy
of word segmentation. However, most segmentation
algorithms are more likely to make errors on names,
as these are less likely to be in the lexicons. Name
tagging can reduce such errors by identifying names
as single units.
Both indexing servers are &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; because
they identify and disambiguate names with high
speed and accuracy. They identify names in texts
dynamically rather than relying on finite lists of
names. Thus, they can identify names which they
have never seen before. In addition, they can dis-
ambiguate types of names so that a person named
&amp;quot;Washington&amp;quot; is distinguished from a place called
Washington, and a company &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot; can be dis-
tinguished from a common noun &amp;quot;apple.&amp;quot; In addi-
tion, they can generate aliases of names automat-
ically (e.g., &amp;quot;ANA&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;All Nippon Airline&amp;quot;) and
link variants of names within a document.
As the indexing servers process texts, the in-
dexed terms are stored in a relational database
with their semantic type information (person, entity,
place, S&amp;T term) and alias information along with
such meta data as source, date, language, and fre-
quency information. The system can use any ODBC
(Open DataBase Connectivity)-compliant database,
and form-based Boolean queries from the Client
Module, similar to those seen in any Web search
engine, are translated into standard SQL queries
automatically. We have decided to use commercial
databases for our applications as we are not only in-
dexing strings of terms but also adding much richer
information on indexed terms available through the
use of IE technology. Furthermore, we plan to apply
data-mining algorithms to the resulting databases
to conduct advanced data analysis and knowledge
discovery.

2.2 The Client Module
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928970588235">
The Client Module lets the user both retrieve and
browse information in the database through the Web
browser-based GUI. In the query mode (cf. Fig-
ure 1), a form-based Boolean query issued by a user
is automatically translated into an SQL query, and
the English terms in the query are sent to the Term
Translation Module. The Client Module then re-
trieves documents which match either the original
English query or the translated Japanese query. As
the indices are names and terms which may con-
sist of multiple words (e.g, &amp;quot;Bill Clinton,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;personal
computer&amp;quot;), the query terms are delimited in sep-
arate boxes in the form, making sure no ambiguity
occurs in both translation and retrieval. The user
has the choice of selecting the sources (e.g, Washing-
ton Post, Nikkei Newspaper, Web pages), languages
(e.g., English, Japanese, or both), and specific date
ranges of documents to constrain queries.
In the browsing mode, the Client Module allows
the user to browse the information in the database
in various ways. As an overview of the database con-
tent, the Client Module lets the user browse the top
25 and 50 most frequent entity, person, and loca-
tion names and S&amp;T terms in the database (cf. Fig-
ure 4). Once the user selects a particular document
for viewing, the client sends the document to an ap-
propriate (i.e., English or Japanese) indexing server
for creating hyperlinks for the indexed terms and in
the case of a Japanese document, sends the indexed
terms to the Term Translation Module to translate
the Japanese terms into English. The result that the
user browses is a document each of whose indexed
terms are hyperlinked to other documents contain-
ing the same indexed terms (cf. Figure 2). Since hy-

perlinking is based on the original or translated En-
glish terms, the user can follow the links to both En-
glish and Japanese documents transparently. In ad-
dition, the Client Module is integrated with a com-
mercial MT system for rough translation. A docu-
ment which the user is browsing can be translated
on the fly by clicking the TRANSLATE button.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996779">
2.3 The Term Translation Module
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999457959183674">
The Term Translation Module is used by the Client
Module bi-directionally in two different modes. It
translates English query terms into Japanese in the
query mode and translates Japanese indexed terms
into English for viewing of a retrieved Japanese text
in the browsing mode.
This translation module is sensitive to the seman-
tic types of terms it is translating to resolve trans-
lation ambiguity. Thus, if a term can be translated
in one way for one type and in another way for an-
other type, the Term Translation Module can output
appropriate translations based on the type informa-
tion. For example, in translating Japanese text into
English, a single kanji (Chinese) character standing
for England can be also a first name of a Japanese
personal name, which should be translated to &amp;quot;Hide&amp;quot;
and not &amp;quot;England.&amp;quot; In translating an English query
into Japanese, a company &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot; should be trans-
lated into a transliteration in katakana and not into
a Japanese word meaning a fruit apple.
The Term Translation Module uses various re-
sources and methods to translate English and
Japanese names. We use automated methods as
much as possible to reduce the cost of creating a
large name lexicon manually.
First, this module is unique in that it creates on
the fly English translations of hiragana names and
personal names. Hiragana names are transliterated
into English using the hiragana-to-romaji mapping
rules. Japanese personal names are translated by
finding a combination of first and last names which
spans the input.&apos; Then, each of the name parts is
translated using the Japanese-English first and last
name lexicons.
In addition, in order to develop a large lexicon
of English names and their Japanese translations,
which are transliterated into katakana, we have au-
tomatically generated katakana names from pho-
netic transcriptions of English names. We have
written rules which maps phonetic transcriptions to
katakana letters, and generated possible Japanese
katakana translations for given English names. As
transliterations of the same English names may dif-
fer, multiple katakana translations may be generated
for single English names.2
The remaining terms are currently translated us-
ing the English-Japanese translation lexicons, and
we are expanding the lexicons by utilizing on-line
resources and corpora and a translation aiding tool.

3 Utilizing IE in Multilingual
Information Access
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998842">
The system applies information extraction technol-
ogy (Adv, 1995) to index names accurately and ro-
bustly. In this section, we describe how we have in-
corporated this technology to improve multilingual
information access in several innovative ways.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997648">
3.1 Query Disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997493529411765">
As described in Section 2.1, the Indexing Module not
only identifies names of people, entities and locations
but also disambiguates types among themselves and
between names and non-names. Thus, if the user is
searching for documents with the location &amp;quot;Wash-
ington (not a person or a company named &amp;quot;Wash-
ington&amp;quot;), a person &amp;quot;Clinton&amp;quot; (not a location), or an
entity &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot; (not fruit), the system allows the user
to specify, through the GUI, the type of each query
term (cf. Figure 1). This ability to disambiguate
types of queries not only constrains the search and
hence improves retrieval precision but also speeds
&apos;The Japanese Indexing Module does not specify if
an identified name is a first name, a last name, or a
combination of first and last name. Since there is no
space between first and last names in Japanese, this must
be automatically determined.

</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998783">
3.2 Translation Disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998932583333334">
In developing the system, we have intentionally
avoided an approach where we first translate foreign-
language documents into English and index the
translated English texts (Fluhr, 1995; Kay, 1995;
Oard and Dorr, 1996). In (Aone et al., 1994), we
have shown that, in an application of extracting in-
formation from foreign language texts and present-
ing the results in English, the &amp;quot;MT first, IE second&amp;quot;
approach was less accurate than the approach in the
reverse order, i.e., &amp;quot;IE first, MT second&amp;quot;. In partic-
ular, translation quality of names by even the best
MT systems is poor.
There are two cases where an MT system fails to
translate names. First, it fails to recognize where
a name starts and ends in a text string. This is a
non-trivial problem in languages such as Japanese
where words are not segmented by spaces and there
is no capitalization convention. Often, an MT sys-
tem &amp;quot;chops up&amp;quot; names into words and translates
each word individually. For example, among the
errors we have encountered, an MT system failed
to recognize a person name &amp;quot;Mon Hanae&amp;quot; in kanji
characters, segmented it into three words &amp;quot;mori,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;hana,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; and translated them into &amp;quot;forest,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;England&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;blessing,&amp;quot; respectively.
Another common MT system error is where the
system fails to make a distinction between names
and non-names. This distinction is very important
in getting correct translations as names are usu-
ally translated very differently from non-names. For
example, a personal name &amp;quot;Dole&amp;quot; in katakana was
translated into a common noun &amp;quot;doll&amp;quot; as the two
have the same katakana string in Japanese. Abbre-
viated country names for Japan and United States in
single kanji characters, which often occurs in news-
papers, were sometimes translated by an MT system
into their literal kanji meanings, &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rice,&amp;quot;
respectively.
Our system avoids these common but serious
translation errors by taking advantage of the Index-
ing Module&apos;s ability to identify and disambiguate
names. In translating terms from Japanese to En-
glish in the browsing mode, the Indexing Module
identifies names correctly, avoiding the first type
of translation errors. Then, the Term Translation
Module utilizes type information obtained by the In-
dexing Module to decide which translation strategies
to use, thus overcoming the second type of error.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987857">
3.3 Intelligent Query Expansion and
Hyperlinking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982666666667">
As described in Section 2.1, the Indexing Module
automatically identifies aliases of names and keeps
track of such alias links in the database. For exam-
ple, if &amp;quot;International Business Machine&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot;
appears in the same document, the system records
in the database that they are aliases.
The system uses this information in automatically
expanding terms for query expansion and hyper-
linking. At the query time, when the user types
&amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot; and chooses the alias option in the search
screen (see Figure 1), the query is automatically ex-
panded to include its variant names both in English
and Japanese, e.g., &amp;quot;International Business Ma-
chine,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;International Business Machine Corp.&amp;quot; and
Japanese translations for &amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot; and their aliases
in Japanese. This is especially useful in retriev-
ing Japanese documents because typically the user
would not know various ways to say &amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot; in
Japanese. The automated query expansion thus
improves retrieval recall without manually creating
alias lexicons.
The same alias capability is also used in hyper-
linking indexed terms in browsing a document. For
example, when a user follows a hyperlink &amp;quot;United
States,&amp;quot; it takes the user to a collection of documents
which contains the English term &amp;quot;United States&amp;quot;
and its aliases (e.g., &amp;quot;US,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;U.S.A.&amp;quot; etc.), and the
Japanese translations of &amp;quot;United States&amp;quot; and their
aliases. The result is a truly transparent multilin-
gual document browsing and access capability.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994007">
3.4 Information Discovery
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872290322581">
One of the biggest advantages of introducing IE tech-
nology into information access systems is the ability
to create rich structured data which can be analyzed
for &amp;quot;buried&amp;quot; information. Our multilingual capabil-
ity enables the merging of possibly complementary
data from both English and Japanese sources and
enriching the available information.
Currently the system offers the user several ways
to explore and discover hidden information. Our
search capability allows interactive information dis-
covery methods. For example, using the query inter-
face, the user can in effect ask &amp;quot;Which company was
mentioned along with Intel in regard to micropro-
cessors?&amp;quot; and the system will return all the articles
which mentions &amp;quot;Intel,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;microprocessors,&amp;quot; and one
or more company names. The user might see that
NexGen and Cyrix often occurs with Intel and find
out that they are competitors of Intel in this field.
Or the user might ask &amp;quot;Who is related to &amp;quot;Shinshin-
tou Party,&amp;quot; a Japanese political party, and the user
can find out all the people associated with this party.
This type of search capabilities cannot be offered by
typical information retrieval systems as they treat
words as just strings and do not distinguish their
semantic attributes.
Furthermore, as we discussed earlier in Sec-
tion 2.2, browsing documents by following hyper-
links allows a user to discover related information
effectively. For example, when the user searches for
documents on &amp;quot;NEC Corp.&amp;quot;, selects one of the re-
turned documents, and finds another company name

<bodyText confidence="0.999967625">
In this section, we give a tour of the system. Figure 4
shows the main Browse screen where the user can
browse the top 25 or 50 names of people, entities,
locations, and S&amp;T terms. This can provide the
user with a snapshot of what is in the database and
what types of information are likely to be available.
By following the top 50 entity name link, the user
sees the list of entity names in order of frequency
(cf. Figure 5). The Subtype column in the screen
indicates more detailed types of the entity (e.g., or-
ganization, company, facility, etc.) From this screen,
the user can go to a list of all English and Japanese

provides information on the title, length, source, lan-

In the main Search screen (cf. Figure 1), the user
types in each query term, including multi-words like

user can formulate a Boolean query using the box
numbers and boolean operators. If not specified, the
query terms are joined by &amp;quot;OR&amp;quot;. When the Alias

We have described an advanced multilingual cross-
linguistic information browsing and retrieval sys-
tem which takes advantage of information extraction
technology in unique ways. In addition to its basic
capability of allowing a user to send Boolean queries
in English against English and Japanese documents
and to view the results in semi- and fully translated
forms, the system has many innovative capabilities.
It can disambiguate query terms to increase preci-
sion, expand query terms automatically using aliases
to increase recall, and improve translation accuracy
significantly by finding and disambiguating names
accurately. Moreover, the system allows interactive
information discovery from a multilingual document
collection by combining IE and MT technologies.
The Indexing Module is currently running on a
Sun platform and is designed to scale for a multi-user
operational environment. The Web browser-based
user interface will work in any Web browser sup-
porting HTML 3.0 on any platform which the Web
browser supports, and this ensures a large user base.
The system is customizable in several ways. For our
current application, the system indexes names and
S&amp;T terms, but for other applications we can cus-
tomize the system to index different types of names
and terms. For example, the system can be cus-
tomized to index product names and financial terms
for a business application. Its ODBC-compliance
makes porting of databases from one vendor to an-
other very easy. Finally, the system does not as-
sume any particular language combination or target
language. Thus, this system can also be used for
Japanese monolingual users who want to query and
browse in Japanese a set of documents written in
English, Japanese, and Spanish.

<abstract confidence="0.998589954545455">In this paper, we describe our multilingual (or cross-linguistic) information browsing and retrieval system, which is aimed at monolingual users who are interested in information from multiple language sources. system takes advantage of technology in novel ways to improve the accuracy of cross-linguistic retrieval and to provide innovative methods for browsing and exploring multilingual document collections. The system indexes texts in different languages (e.g., English and Japanese) and allows the users to retrieve relevant texts in their native language (e.g., English). The retrieved text is then presented to the users with proper names and specialized domain terms translated and hyperlinked. Moreover, the system allows interactive information discovery from a multilingual document collection. More and more multilingual information is available on-line every day. The World Wide Web (WWW), for example, is becoming a vast depository of multilingual information. However, monolingual users can currently access information only in their native language. For example, it is not easy for a monolingual English speaker to locate necessary information written in Japanese. The users would not know the query terms in Japanese even if the search engine accepts Japanese queries. In addition, even when the users locate a possibly relevant text in Japanese, they will have little idea about what is in the text. Outputs of off-the-shelf machine translation (MT) systems are often of low-quality, and even &amp;quot;high-end&amp;quot; MT systems have problems particularly in translating proper names and specialized domain terms, which often contain the most critical information to the users. In this paper, we describe our multilingual (or cross-linguistic) information browsing and retrieval system, which is aimed at monolingual users who are interested in information from multiple language The system takes advantage of technology in novel ways to improve the accuracy of cross-linguistic retrieval and to provide innovative methods for browsing and exploring multilingual document collections. The system indexes texts in different languages (e.g., English and Japanese) and allows the users to retrieve relevant texts in their native language (e.g., English). The retrieved text is then presented to the users with proper names and specialized domain terms translated and hyperlinked. The system also allows the in their native language to browse and information buried in the database derived from the entire document collection. 2 System Description The system consists of the Indexing Module, the Client Module, the Term Translation Module, and the Web Crawler. The Indexing Module creates and loads indices into a database while the Client Module allows browsing and retrieval of information in the database through a Web browser-based graphical user interface (GUI). The Term Translation Module is bi-directional; it dynamically translates user queries into target foreign languages and the indexed terms in retrieved documents into the user&apos;s native language. The Web Crawler can be used to add textual information from the WWW; it fetches pages from user-specified Web sites at specified intervals, and queues them up for the Indexing Module to ingest regularly. For our current application, the system indexes names of people, entities, and locations, and scientific and technical (S&amp;T) terms in both English and Japanese texts, and allows the user to query and browse the database in English. When Japanese texts are retrieved, indexed terms are translated into English. system is designed to expand to other lan- 332 guages besides English and Japanese and other domains beyond S&amp;T terms. Moreover, the Englishcentric browsing and retrieval mode can be switched according to the users&apos; language preference so that, for example, a Japanese user can query and browse English documents in Japanese. 2.1 The Intelligent Indexing Module The Indexing Module indexes names of people, entities, and locations and a list of scientific and technical (S&amp;T) terms using state-of-the-art IE technology. It uses different configurations of the same fast indexing engine called NameTagTm for different languages. Two separate configurations (&amp;quot;indexing servers&amp;quot;) are used for English and Japanese, and how the English and Japanese indexing servers work is described in (Krupka, 1995; Aone, 1996). In the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6), the English system was benchmarked against the Wall Street Journal blind test set for the name tagging task, and achieved a 96% Fmeasure, which is a combination of recall and precision measures (Adv, 1995),. Our internal testing of the Japanese system against blind test sets of various Japanese newspaper articles indicates that it achieves from high-80 to low-90% accuracy, depending on the types of corpora. Indexing names in Japanese texts is usually more challenging than English for two main reasons. First, there is no case distinction in Japanese, whereas English names in newspapers are capitalized, and capitalization is a very strong clue for English name tagging. Second, Japanese words are not separated by spaces and therefore must be segmented into separate words before the name tagging process. As segmentation is not 100% accurate, segmentation errors can sometimes cause name tagging rules not to fire or to misfire. Indexing of names is particularly useful in the Japanese case as it can improve overall segmentation and thus indexing accuracy. In English, since words are separated by spaces, there is no issue of indexing accuracy for individual words. On the other hand, in languages like Japanese, where word boundaries are not explicitly marked by spaces, indexing accuracy of individual words depends on accuracy of word segmentation. However, most segmentation algorithms are more likely to make errors on names, as these are less likely to be in the lexicons. Name tagging can reduce such errors by identifying names as single units. Both indexing servers are &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot; because with high speed and accuracy. They identify names in texts dynamically rather than relying on finite lists of names. Thus, they can identify names which they never seen before. In addition, they can disambiguate types of names so that a person named &amp;quot;Washington&amp;quot; is distinguished from a place called Washington, and a company &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot; can be distinguished from a common noun &amp;quot;apple.&amp;quot; In addithey can of names automatically (e.g., &amp;quot;ANA&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;All Nippon Airline&amp;quot;) and of names within a document. As the indexing servers process texts, the indexed terms are stored in a relational database with their semantic type information (person, entity, place, S&amp;T term) and alias information along with such meta data as source, date, language, and frequency information. The system can use any ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity)-compliant database, and form-based Boolean queries from the Client Module, similar to those seen in any Web search engine, are translated into standard SQL queries automatically. We have decided to use commercial databases for our applications as we are not only indexing strings of terms but also adding much richer information on indexed terms available through the use of IE technology. Furthermore, we plan to apply data-mining algorithms to the resulting databases to conduct advanced data analysis and knowledge discovery. 2.2 The Client Module The Client Module lets the user both retrieve and browse information in the database through the Web browser-based GUI. In the query mode (cf. Figure 1), a form-based Boolean query issued by a user is automatically translated into an SQL query, and the English terms in the query are sent to the Term Translation Module. The Client Module then retrieves documents which match either the original English query or the translated Japanese query. As the indices are names and terms which may consist of multiple words (e.g, &amp;quot;Bill Clinton,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;personal computer&amp;quot;), the query terms are delimited in separate boxes in the form, making sure no ambiguity occurs in both translation and retrieval. The user has the choice of selecting the sources (e.g, Washington Post, Nikkei Newspaper, Web pages), languages (e.g., English, Japanese, or both), and specific date ranges of documents to constrain queries. In the browsing mode, the Client Module allows the user to browse the information in the database in various ways. As an overview of the database content, the Client Module lets the user browse the top 25 and 50 most frequent entity, person, and location names and S&amp;T terms in the database (cf. Figure 4). Once the user selects a particular document for viewing, the client sends the document to an appropriate (i.e., English or Japanese) indexing server for creating hyperlinks for the indexed terms and in the case of a Japanese document, sends the indexed terms to the Term Translation Module to translate the Japanese terms into English. The result that the user browses is a document each of whose indexed terms are hyperlinked to other documents contain-</abstract>

In addition, the Client Module is integrated with a commercial MT system for rough translation. A document which the user is browsing can be translated on the fly by clicking the TRANSLATE button. 2.3 The Term Translation Module The Term Translation Module is used by the Client Module bi-directionally in two different modes. It translates English query terms into Japanese in the query mode and translates Japanese indexed terms into English for viewing of a retrieved Japanese text in the browsing mode. This translation module is sensitive to the semantic types of terms it is translating to resolve translation ambiguity. Thus, if a term can be translated in one way for one type and in another way for another type, the Term Translation Module can output appropriate translations based on the type informa- For example, in translating Japanese into a single character standing for England can be also a first name of a Japanese personal name, which should be translated to &amp;quot;Hide&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;England.&amp;quot; In translating an English query into Japanese, a company &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot; should be transinto a transliteration in not into a Japanese word meaning a fruit apple. The Term Translation Module uses various remethods to translate English and Japanese names. We use automated methods as much as possible to reduce the cost of creating a large name lexicon manually. this module is unique in that it on fly English translations of and personal names. Hiragana names are transliterated into English using the hiragana-to-romaji mapping rules. Japanese personal names are translated by finding a combination of first and last names which spans the input.&apos; Then, each of the name parts is translated using the Japanese-English first and last In addition, in order to develop a large lexicon of English names and their Japanese translations, are transliterated into have automatically generated katakana names from phonetic transcriptions of English names. We have written rules which maps phonetic transcriptions to katakana letters, and generated possible Japanese katakana translations for given English names. As transliterations of the same English names may differ, multiple katakana translations may be generated single English The remaining terms are currently translated using the English-Japanese translation lexicons, and we are expanding the lexicons by utilizing on-line resources and corpora and a translation aiding tool. 3 Utilizing IE in Multilingual Information Access system applies extraction technology (Adv, 1995) to index names accurately and robustly. In this section, we describe how we have incorporated this technology to improve multilingual in innovative ways. 3.1 Query Disambiguation As described in Section 2.1, the Indexing Module not only identifies names of people, entities and locations but also disambiguates types among themselves and between names and non-names. Thus, if the user is searching for documents with the location &amp;quot;Washington (not a person or a company named &amp;quot;Washington&amp;quot;), a person &amp;quot;Clinton&amp;quot; (not a location), or an entity &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot; (not fruit), the system allows the user to specify, through the GUI, the type of each query term (cf. Figure 1). This ability to disambiguate types of queries not only constrains the search and hence improves retrieval precision but also speeds &apos;The Japanese Indexing Module does not specify if an identified name is a first name, a last name, or a combination of first and last name. Since there is no space between first and last names in Japanese, this must be automatically determined. is still an experimental effort, and we have not evaluated the quality of generated translations quantitatively yet. 335 up the search time considerably especially when the database is very large. 3.2 Translation Disambiguation In developing the system, we have intentionally an approach where we first translate foreignlanguage documents into English and index the translated English texts (Fluhr, 1995; Kay, 1995; Oard and Dorr, 1996). In (Aone et al., 1994), we have shown that, in an application of extracting information from foreign language texts and presenting the results in English, the &amp;quot;MT first, IE second&amp;quot; approach was less accurate than the approach in the reverse order, i.e., &amp;quot;IE first, MT second&amp;quot;. In particular, translation quality of names by even the best MT systems is poor. There are two cases where an MT system fails to translate names. First, it fails to recognize where a name starts and ends in a text string. This is a non-trivial problem in languages such as Japanese where words are not segmented by spaces and there no capitalization convention. Often, an MT system &amp;quot;chops up&amp;quot; names into words and translates each word individually. For example, among the errors we have encountered, an MT system failed to recognize a person name &amp;quot;Mon Hanae&amp;quot; in kanji characters, segmented it into three words &amp;quot;mori,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hana,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; and translated them into &amp;quot;forest,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;England&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;blessing,&amp;quot; respectively. Another common MT system error is where the system fails to make a distinction between names and non-names. This distinction is very important in getting correct translations as names are usually translated very differently from non-names. For example, a personal name &amp;quot;Dole&amp;quot; in katakana was translated into a common noun &amp;quot;doll&amp;quot; as the two the same katakana string in Japanese. Abbreviated country names for Japan and United States in single kanji characters, which often occurs in newspapers, were sometimes translated by an MT system into their literal kanji meanings, &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rice,&amp;quot; respectively. Our system avoids these common but serious errors by taking advantage of the Indexing Module&apos;s ability to identify and disambiguate names. In translating terms from Japanese to English in the browsing mode, the Indexing Module identifies names correctly, avoiding the first type of translation errors. Then, the Term Translation Module utilizes type information obtained by the Indexing Module to decide which translation strategies to use, thus overcoming the second type of error. 3.3 Intelligent Query Expansion and Hyperlinking As described in Section 2.1, the Indexing Module automatically identifies aliases of names and keeps track of such alias links in the database. For examif &amp;quot;International Business Machine&amp;quot; and appears in the same document, the system records in the database that they are aliases. The system uses this information in automatically expanding terms for query expansion and hyperlinking. At the query time, when the user types chooses the in the search screen (see Figure 1), the query is automatically expanded to include its variant names both in English and Japanese, e.g., &amp;quot;International Business Machine,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;International Business Machine Corp.&amp;quot; and Japanese translations for &amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot; and their aliases in Japanese. This is especially useful in retrieving Japanese documents because typically the user would not know various ways to say &amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot; in Japanese. The automated query expansion thus improves retrieval recall without manually creating alias lexicons. The same alias capability is also used in hyperlinking indexed terms in browsing a document. For example, when a user follows a hyperlink &amp;quot;United States,&amp;quot; it takes the user to a collection of documents which contains the English term &amp;quot;United States&amp;quot; and its aliases (e.g., &amp;quot;US,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;U.S.A.&amp;quot; etc.), and the Japanese translations of &amp;quot;United States&amp;quot; and their aliases. The result is a truly transparent multilingual document browsing and access capability. 3.4 Information Discovery One of the biggest advantages of introducing IE technology into information access systems is the ability to create rich structured data which can be analyzed for &amp;quot;buried&amp;quot; information. Our multilingual capability enables the merging of possibly complementary data from both English and Japanese sources and enriching the available information. Currently the system offers the user several ways to explore and discover hidden information. Our search capability allows interactive information discovery methods. For example, using the query interface, the user can in effect ask &amp;quot;Which company was mentioned along with Intel in regard to microprocessors?&amp;quot; and the system will return all the articles mentions &amp;quot;Intel,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;microprocessors,&amp;quot; or more company names. The user might see that NexGen and Cyrix often occurs with Intel and find out that they are competitors of Intel in this field. Or the user might ask &amp;quot;Who is related to &amp;quot;Shinshintou Party,&amp;quot; a Japanese political party, and the user can find out all the people associated with this party. This type of search capabilities cannot be offered by typical information retrieval systems as they treat words as just strings and do not distinguish their semantic attributes. Furthermore, as we discussed earlier in Section 2.2, browsing documents by following hyperlinks allows a user to discover related information effectively. For example, when the user searches for documents on &amp;quot;NEC Corp.&amp;quot;, selects one of the returned documents, and finds another company name 336 Figure 3: Person Names Co-occurring with Peru &amp;quot;Toshiba&amp;quot; mentioned in this document, the user can establish an immediate connection and follow the from &amp;quot;Toshiba&amp;quot; to other English documents which contain that term. In addition, for each indexed term, the user can explore co-occurring persons, entities, places and technology. For example, Figure 3 shows a list of people co-occurring with the place &amp;quot;Peru.&amp;quot; It lists the Japanese prime minister and the Peruvian president at the top (as the Japanese embassy hostage incident occurred recently.) 4 The System Tour In this section, we give a tour of the system. Figure 4 shows the main Browse screen where the user can browse the top 25 or 50 names of people, entities, locations, and S&amp;T terms. This can provide the user with a snapshot of what is in the database and what types of information are likely to be available. By following the top 50 entity name link, the user sees the list of entity names in order of frequency Figure 5). The in the screen indicates more detailed types of the entity (e.g., organization, company, facility, etc.) From this screen, the user can go to a list of all English and Japanese documents which mention, for example, &amp;quot;Bank of Japan&amp;quot; by clicking the link (cf. Figure 6). The list provides information on the title, length, source, language, and date of each article.</abstract>

The user can formulate a Boolean query using the box numbers and boolean operators. If not specified, the query terms are joined by &amp;quot;OR&amp;quot;. When the Alias button is on, query terms are expanded to include their aliases. The Type menu allows the user to disambiguate types of query terms. In the Language box, the user has the choice of selecting documents in English, Japanese, or both. In addition, the user can constrain sources and the date range of documents, and also sort the results by date, title, and sources. As discussed in Section 2.2, when the user selects a Japanese article, they can optionally send the article to a commercial MT system for rough translation by the (cf. Figure2). Figure 7 shows the translation result for the Japanese document in Figure 2. 5 Summary We have described an advanced multilingual crosslinguistic information browsing and retrieval system which takes advantage of information extraction technology in unique ways. In addition to its basic capability of allowing a user to send Boolean queries in English against English and Japanese documents and to view the results in semiand fully translated forms, the system has many innovative capabilities. It can disambiguate query terms to increase precision, expand query terms automatically using aliases to increase recall, and improve translation accuracy significantly by finding and disambiguating names accurately. Moreover, the system allows interactive information discovery from a multilingual document collection by combining IE and MT technologies. The Indexing Module is currently running on a Sun platform and is designed to scale for a multi-user operational environment. The Web browser-based user interface will work in any Web browser supporting HTML 3.0 on any platform which the Web browser supports, and this ensures a large user base. The system is customizable in several ways. For our current application, the system indexes names and S&amp;T terms, but for other applications we can customize the system to index different types of names and terms. For example, the system can be customized to index product names and financial terms for a business application. Its ODBC-compliance makes porting of databases from one vendor to another very easy. Finally, the system does not assume any particular language combination or target language. Thus, this system can also be used for Japanese monolingual users who want to query and browse in Japanese a set of documents written in English, Japanese, and Spanish.</abstract>

Our internal testing of the Japanese system against blind test sets of various Japanese newspaper articles indicates that it achieves from high-80 to low-90% accuracy, depending on the types of corpora.
