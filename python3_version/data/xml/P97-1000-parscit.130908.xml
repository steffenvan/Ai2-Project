PREFACE

<bodyText confidence="0.9961221">
We are pleased to present you with this volume containing the papers accepted for presentation
at the 35th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 8th Conference
of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, July 7-12, 1997 at
the Universidad Nacional de Eclucacion a Distancia (UNED) Madrid, Spain.
In this, the first joint meeting of the American and European chapters of the Association for
Computational Linguistics, you will find a wealth of high-quality papers, tutorials, and
workshops on a wide range of topics related to natural language processing. This year&apos;s
response to the Call for Papers was overwhelming - a 47% increase over the number of
submissions to ACL&apos;96. This dramatic increase in papers submitted indicates the field is
thriving.
This volume contains 63 papers, which were chosen from the 264 that were submitted to the
conference. With an acceptance rate of 24%, ACL-EACL&apos;97 is one of the most selective
international conferences of 1997.
This year, reviewing was conducted by a hierarchically structured program committee,
consisting of five area chairs and 53 regular program committee members, supported by the
invaluable assistance of 54 additional specialist reviewers. Their names are listed on the
following pages. Reviewing was conducted blind, to all reviewers and area chairs.
All papers that remained controversial for some reason - or for which reviewers indicated low
confidence in their judgements - were explicitly discussed at the meeting of the PC Chairs and
the Area Chairs on March 2, 1997 in Brighton.
32 accepted papers come from North America (51%), 25 from Europe (40%) and 6 from Asia
(9%). ACL-EACL 97 is a truely international conference: authors from 16 different countries
contribute accepted papers. The top three contributing countries are: USA (29), Germany (9),
and Japan (5).
It is interesting to note that 20 papers (32%) were authored by reseachers working in industrial
labs. This shows clearly the industrial and economic relevance of our field.
There was an increase of papers (6) based on transatlantic collaboration between US researchers
and researchers from Finland, France, Israel, Italy, Romania and the United Kingdom. This is a
very encouraging trend that is certainly due to increased telecooperation based on the Internet.
The technical program will consist of two full tracks, and occasionally a third parallel session
for student papers. Unfortunately, given space considerations, many very good papers could
not be accepted. However, the substantial increase in submissions will undoubtedly cause
future organizers to consider further changes in conference structure.
In addition to the technical program, this year there are four tutorials, a record twelve
workshops over two days, two student sessions with ten papers, numerous demonstrations,
and book exhibits. We are also fortunate to have David Sadek from France Telecom and Nino
Varile from the European Commission delivering invited addresses. David Sadek will speak
about &amp;quot;Rational Agency as the Basis for Natural Dialogue: The ARTIMIS Technology&amp;quot;, and
Nino Varile will discuss &amp;quot;Current and Future EU Activities in the Field of Language
Technologies&amp;quot;.

We would like to thank everybody who helped to bring about the richness and high standards of
the ACL-EACL&apos;97 conference. We thank all of the authors of submitted papers for choosing
ACL-EACL&apos;97 as a forum for the communication of their research results. We have been
constantly impressed by the dedication of the Area Chairs and other Program Committee
Members, who worked very hard to get the best possible job done. Special praise goes to our
workshop coordinator, Harald Trost from the Austrian Research Institute for Al, who ably
arranged the post-conference workshops, and to Megurni Kameyama from SRI International,
who put together an excellent slate of tutorial speakers. We are very grateful to Pamela Jordan
and Johan Bos, who organized two most interesting student sesssions.
We would like to express our gratitude to Kathy McKeown and Priscilla Rasmussen, who
provided support and guidance for our work. In addition, we are most appreciative of the
outstanding job performed by Marfa Felisa Verdejo, the local arrangements chair, and her Local
Organizing Committee in Madrid.
We would like to thank the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) for
providing internal financial support for both administrative and technical tasks related to the
conference.
Ira Smith from OGI, who handled the electronic submissions, designed and maintained the
submission database, Jochen Muller from DFKI, who designed the interactive Web form for
reviewing, maintained the review database and formatted the front pages, Gabi Jacquinot, who
maintained the PC database and helped with the Proceedings, and Vivienne Wicks, who
arranged a very pleasant PC meeting in Brighton, deserve special mention for the excellent
support that they provided.

David Powers, The Flinders University of South Australia
Over the last 30 years, issues relating to how language can be learned have shaped fields as diverse as linguistics,
automata theory, and psycholinguistics. More recently, machine learning and neural nets have found linguistic problems
a natural target for exploration and demonstration of techniques. Conversely, computational linguistics, natural language
processing and speech technology are all actively looking for ways in which learning can be put to practical use in
specific applications. Indeed, the increasing availability of large corpora and treebanks promises that the recent explosion
in interest will continue.
This tutorial will provide the participant with an understanding of the perspectives on language learning adopted by the
different fields, will explore the nature and significance of the various theoretical results, and will characterize and
explain the basic machine learning paradigms and algorithms which have been used for language learning. Recent work
will be characterized in terms of this framework, with more detailed case studies being drawn from two different
paradigms. The focus here will be on developing an intuition as to how and why the various techniques work.
David Powers is co-author of the Springer monograph &apos;Machine Learning of Natural Language&apos; and is currently President
of SIGNLL, the ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning. This tutorial will provide background
useful to those contemplating attending SIGNLL&apos;s two day CoNLL workshop.

Information Retrieval (IR) is a dynamically growing field of research and development activities which offers many
substantial job opportunities to linguists. The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce computational or theoretical
linguists to IR, thus enabling them to make reasonable decisions on linguistic issues in an IR context. The tutorial will
give an overview of all major issues in IR research and development that are relevant to a linguist in that context.
An important focus will be the effectiveness of linguistic approaches to IR: Which methods are provably effective, and
which ones, in spite of arguments to the contrary, are not? The literature on linguistic IR experiments reports many
conflicting results. The IR community is split into those who believe language technology can improve retrieval results
and those who do not. The entire IR machinery necessary to understand this situation, in terms of retrieval models,
evaluation, system architectures, applications, linguistic representation etc. will be focused in this tutorial.

Maximum Entropy Modeling for Natural Language 3:00PM--6:30PM
Eric Sven Ristad, Princeton University
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998960875">
The maximum entropy framework is a powerful method for building statistical models of natural language. It is
expressive, allowing modelers to easily represent their special insights into the data generating machinery. It is
statistically efficient, because it models the intersection of complex events without increasing the number of parameters
or fragmenting the training data. And it provides strong models, models that can outperform their traditional variants
with less tweaking. This tutorial explains how to build maximum entropy models for natural language applications
such as information retrieval and speech recognition. We review the maximum entropy framework, explore the art of
effective feature design, and show how to implement models using the instructor&apos;s publicly available Maximum Entropy
Modeling Toolkit.

Logical Approaches to Syntactic Theories 3:00PM--6:30PM

<bodyText confidence="0.998361181818182">
The trend, over the last ten or fifteen years, has been towards specifying syntactic structures in terms of constraints on
their form rather than via mechanisms for generating them. This leads naturally to a fully declarative approach in which
sets of syntactic structures are treated as sets of ordinary mathematical models and theories of syntax are defined by
systems of logical axioms. This model-theoretic approach allows existing tools of mathematical logic to be applied to
formal issues in syntax. In addition to the obvious applications to questions of consistency and independence of sets of
constraints, results have been obtained establishing the complexity of constraint based theories, logical axiomatizations
have been employed as a common framework in which to compare strongly dissimilar generative systems, and
automata-based proof techniques have begun to be explored as novel approaches to processing languages axiomatized in
this way. This tutorial will explore the foundations of this approach, the results it has yielded so far, and the potential it
holds. The presentation will presume only a passing familiarity with basic formal logic and traditional theories of
syntax (e.g., GB and GPSG).

PREFACE TO THE STUDENT SESSION PAPERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99367945">
These proceedings include the extended abstracts accepted for presentation at the Student Session
of the 35th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 8th Conference of the
European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. The goal of the Student Session
is to provide a forum for student members to present work in progress, rather than completed work,
and to receive feedback from other members of the computational linguistics community, particularly
senior researchers. The response to the ACL Student Sessions held during the previous years was
very positive. The student authors consistently report that they find the Student Sessions valuable,
and answers to questionnaires filled out by ACL members (most recently in 1995) indicate that the
audiences find the sessions interesting and of high quality.
In previous years, the ACL Student Session had moved from paper presentations to poster pre-
sentations while the EACL Student Session had continued with paper presentations. Although this
year&apos;s Call for Papers advertised a Student poster session, the Program Co-Chairs encouraged us to
switch to paper presentations. We thank Wolfgang Wahlster and Phil Cohen for this opportunity to
have paper presentations once again.
Forty-two papers were submitted to the Student Session and we accepted ten of these. We thank
all the authors for their submissions, and hope that the reviews provided constructive criticism and
encouraged them in their research.
We also thank all of the reviewers for the time they spent doing careful reviews of the submissions.
Everyone was most cooperative and forgiving as we negotiated matches between reviewers and papers.

<abstract confidence="0.9739894375">PREFACE We are pleased to present you with this volume containing the papers accepted for presentation at the 35th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 8th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, July 7-12, 1997 at the Universidad Nacional de Eclucacion a Distancia (UNED) Madrid, Spain. In this, the first joint meeting of the American and European chapters of the Association for Computational Linguistics, you will find a wealth of high-quality papers, tutorials, and workshops on a wide range of topics related to natural language processing. This year&apos;s response to the Call for Papers was overwhelming a 47% increase over the number of submissions to ACL&apos;96. This dramatic increase in papers submitted indicates the field is thriving. This volume contains 63 papers, which were chosen from the 264 that were submitted to the conference. With an acceptance rate of 24%, ACL-EACL&apos;97 is one of the most selective international conferences of 1997. This year, reviewing was conducted by a hierarchically structured program committee, consisting of five area chairs and 53 regular program committee members, supported by the invaluable assistance of 54 additional specialist reviewers. Their names are listed on the following pages. Reviewing was conducted blind, to all reviewers and area chairs. All papers that remained controversial for some reason or for which reviewers indicated low confidence in their judgements were explicitly discussed at the meeting of the PC Chairs and the Area Chairs on March 2, 1997 in Brighton. 32 accepted papers come from North America (51%), 25 from Europe (40%) and 6 from Asia (9%). ACL-EACL 97 is a truely international conference: authors from 16 different countries contribute accepted papers. The top three contributing countries are: USA (29), Germany (9), and Japan (5). It is interesting to note that 20 papers (32%) were authored by reseachers working in industrial labs. This shows clearly the industrial and economic relevance of our field. There was an increase of papers (6) based on transatlantic collaboration between US researchers and researchers from Finland, France, Israel, Italy, Romania and the United Kingdom. This is a very encouraging trend that is certainly due to increased telecooperation based on the Internet. The technical program will consist of two full tracks, and occasionally a third parallel session for student papers. Unfortunately, given space considerations, many very good papers could not be accepted. However, the substantial increase in submissions will undoubtedly cause future organizers to consider further changes in conference structure. In addition to the technical program, this year there are four tutorials, a record twelve workshops over two days, two student sessions with ten papers, numerous demonstrations, and book exhibits. We are also fortunate to have David Sadek from France Telecom and Nino Varile from the European Commission delivering invited addresses. David Sadek will speak about &amp;quot;Rational Agency as the Basis for Natural Dialogue: The ARTIMIS Technology&amp;quot;, and Nino Varile will discuss &amp;quot;Current and Future EU Activities in the Field of Language Technologies&amp;quot;. III We would like to thank everybody who helped to bring about the richness and high standards of the ACL-EACL&apos;97 conference. We thank all of the authors of submitted papers for choosing ACL-EACL&apos;97 as a forum for the communication of their research results. We have been constantly impressed by the dedication of the Area Chairs and other Program Committee Members, who worked very hard to get the best possible job done. Special praise goes to our workshop coordinator, Harald Trost from the Austrian Research Institute for Al, who ably arranged the post-conference workshops, and to Megurni Kameyama from SRI International, who put together an excellent slate of tutorial speakers. We are very grateful to Pamela Jordan and Johan Bos, who organized two most interesting student sesssions. We would like to express our gratitude to Kathy McKeown and Priscilla Rasmussen, who provided support and guidance for our work. In addition, we are most appreciative of the outstanding job performed by Marfa Felisa Verdejo, the local arrangements chair, and her Local Organizing Committee in Madrid. We would like to thank the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) for providing internal financial support for both administrative and technical tasks related to the conference. Ira Smith from OGI, who handled the electronic submissions, designed and maintained the submission database, Jochen Muller from DFKI, who designed the interactive Web form for reviewing, maintained the review database and formatted the front pages, Gabi Jacquinot, who maintained the PC database and helped with the Proceedings, and Vivienne Wicks, who arranged a very pleasant PC meeting in Brighton, deserve special mention for the excellent support that they provided.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.968175291666667">Over the last 30 years, issues relating to how language can be learned have shaped fields as diverse as linguistics, automata theory, and psycholinguistics. More recently, machine learning and neural nets have found linguistic problems a natural target for exploration and demonstration of techniques. Conversely, computational linguistics, natural language processing and speech technology are all actively looking for ways in which learning can be put to practical use in specific applications. Indeed, the increasing availability of large corpora and treebanks promises that the recent explosion in interest will continue. This tutorial will provide the participant with an understanding of the perspectives on language learning adopted by the different fields, will explore the nature and significance of the various theoretical results, and will characterize and explain the basic machine learning paradigms and algorithms which have been used for language learning. Recent work will be characterized in terms of this framework, with more detailed case studies being drawn from two different paradigms. The focus here will be on developing an intuition as to how and why the various techniques work. David Powers is co-author of the Springer monograph &apos;Machine Learning of Natural Language&apos; and is currently President of SIGNLL, the ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning. This tutorial will provide background useful to those contemplating attending SIGNLL&apos;s two day CoNLL workshop. Information Retrieval from a Linguist&apos;s Perspective 9:30AM--1:00PM Sebastian GOser, IBM Germany, Gerda Ruge, Technical University of Munich Information Retrieval (IR) is a dynamically growing field of research and development activities which offers many substantial job opportunities to linguists. The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce computational or theoretical linguists to IR, thus enabling them to make reasonable decisions on linguistic issues in an IR context. The tutorial will give an overview of all major issues in IR research and development that are relevant to a linguist in that context. An important focus will be the effectiveness of linguistic approaches to IR: Which methods are provably effective, and which ones, in spite of arguments to the contrary, are not? The literature on linguistic IR experiments reports many conflicting results. The IR community is split into those who believe language technology can improve retrieval results and those who do not. The entire IR machinery necessary to understand this situation, in terms of retrieval models, evaluation, system architectures, applications, linguistic representation etc. will be focused in this tutorial. Maximum Entropy Modeling for Natural Language 3:00PM--6:30PM Eric Sven Ristad, Princeton University The maximum entropy framework is a powerful method for building statistical models of natural language. It is expressive, allowing modelers to easily represent their special insights into the data generating machinery. It is statistically efficient, because it models the intersection of complex events without increasing the number of parameters or fragmenting the training data. And it provides strong models, models that can outperform their traditional variants with less tweaking. This tutorial explains how to build maximum entropy models for natural language applications such as information retrieval and speech recognition. We review the maximum entropy framework, explore the art of effective feature design, and show how to implement models using the instructor&apos;s publicly available Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit. Logical Approaches to Syntactic Theories 3:00PM--6:30PM James Rogers, University of Central Florida, Thomas Cornell, SFB 340, University of Tubingen The trend, over the last ten or fifteen years, has been towards specifying syntactic structures in terms of constraints on their form rather than via mechanisms for generating them. This leads naturally to a fully declarative approach in which sets of syntactic structures are treated as sets of ordinary mathematical models and theories of syntax are defined by systems of logical axioms. This model-theoretic approach allows existing tools of mathematical logic to be applied to formal issues in syntax. In addition to the obvious applications to questions of consistency and independence of sets of constraints, results have been obtained establishing the complexity of constraint based theories, logical axiomatizations have been employed as a common framework in which to compare strongly dissimilar generative systems, and automata-based proof techniques have begun to be explored as novel approaches to processing languages axiomatized in this way. This tutorial will explore the foundations of this approach, the results it has yielded so far, and the potential it holds. The presentation will presume only a passing familiarity with basic formal logic and traditional theories of syntax (e.g., GB and GPSG).</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.921610722222222">the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 8th Conference of the Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. goal of the Student Session is to provide a forum for student members to present work in progress, rather than completed work, and to receive feedback from other members of the computational linguistics community, particularly senior researchers. The response to the ACL Student Sessions held during the previous years was very positive. The student authors consistently report that they find the Student Sessions valuable, and answers to questionnaires filled out by ACL members (most recently in 1995) indicate that the audiences find the sessions interesting and of high quality. In previous years, the ACL Student Session had moved from paper presentations to poster presentations while the EACL Student Session had continued with paper presentations. Although this year&apos;s Call for Papers advertised a Student poster session, the Program Co-Chairs encouraged us to switch to paper presentations. We thank Wolfgang Wahlster and Phil Cohen for this opportunity to have paper presentations once again. Forty-two papers were submitted to the Student Session and we accepted ten of these. We thank all the authors for their submissions, and hope that the reviews provided constructive criticism and encouraged them in their research. We also thank all of the reviewers for the time they spent doing careful reviews of the submissions. Everyone was most cooperative and forgiving as we negotiated matches between reviewers and papers.</abstract>
