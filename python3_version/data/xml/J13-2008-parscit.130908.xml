As the name of the book suggests, Arabic is
a rather challenging language to handle in a
machine translation (MT) system. The main
challenges that are discussed and tackled
throughout the book include Arabic complex
morphology and a different syntactic struc-
ture from English.
The book assembles recent work targeting
Arabic-to-English and English-to-Arabic ma-
chine translation. Paradigms for MT include
statistical MT (SMT) and example-based
MT (EBMT). Techniques to improve the MT
quality include preprocessing (Arabic seg-
mentation, reordering) and syntactic models
for SMT, and generalized matching for EBMT.
The domains of research that are presented
in the book are rather broad, but it lacks
a unified experimental environment, render-
ing a comparison of the empirical results
hard. One additional caveat is the partial
quantitative information about Arabic trans-
lation challenges. Statistics about Arabic
ambiguity and about the amount and com-
plexity of reorderings, and a comparison to
other language pairs (e.g., German–English),
could be meaningful and relate well to the
title of the book. Additionally, this informa-
tion can justify the need for a special treat-
ment of the Arabic language within the MT
community.
Finally, the strong side of the book in-
cludes exploration of less dominant research
fields as English-to-Arabic MT and EBMT. A
comparison of SMT and EBMT, and a dis-
cussion of advantages and disadvantages of
the paradigms is also given. I would rec-
ommend the book for MT professionals as
a useful starting point containing references
and established work on Arabic MT.—Saab
