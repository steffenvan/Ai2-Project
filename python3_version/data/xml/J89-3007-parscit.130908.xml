lack of an index. An even greater deficit is the absence
of a comprehensive bibliography. One could receive the
false impression that the book is a first work by the
group (it builds directly on Harris 1982, 1988), or that
they are the only group working in sublanguage (cf. the
collections by Kittredge and Lehrberger (1982) and
Grishman and Kittredge (1986). The absence of refer-
ences to related work in theoretical or computational
linguistics makes the book much less accessible to
readers unfamiliar with the sublanguage approach. This
is truly unfortunate since there are many fruitful corre-
spondences.
In summary, the book offers a clear description of a
much-needed methodology for knowledge acquisition,
and a concise, formulaic representation for science
information. It is highly recommended to anyone devel-
oping text-processing applications in restricted seman-
tic domains.

This collection of 10 papers incorporates proceedings of
the 1985 Lund conference on generalized quantifiers
(GQ). Research on GQ was brought into natural lan-
guage analysis in 1981 by Barwise and Cooper in their
&amp;quot;Generalized quantifiers and natural language&amp;quot;. The
aim was to elevate model-theoretic analysis of NL
phenomena from a sterile exercise in formalization to a
valuable stimulus in development of linguistic theory.
Following Montague&apos;s PTQ, generalized quantifiers
were treated not as the determiner expressions in a
noun phrase (NP), but rather as the entire NP construc-
tion. An NP determiner functions to select a family of
sets from the head noun&apos;s extension as the denotation
for the NP. Interpretation of the noun denotation as a
restriction upon the domain of quantification then al-
lows for uniform semantics for NPs, encompassing
non-logical determiners, (e.g., most, a few), along with
the traditional logical determiners such as every and
some.
The articles in this volume pick up on this theme by
extending the GQ analysis to many of the syntactically
varied forms of NP constructions. At least four distinct
approaches to semantic interpretation are considered,
showing the interest in exploring alternatives to the
possible worlds interpretations of Montague.
Jon Barwise and Robin Cooper each have contribu-
tions that incorporate interpretive structures from situ-
ation semantics in building an alternative to Montague&apos;s
model-theoretic interpretations. Situation semantics of-
fers a more intuitive and simplified domain of individu-
als, properties, and facts for model-theoretic construc-
tion than the intensional domain of functions across
possible worlds. Because the focus is on logical inves-
tigations into the semantic properties of GQs, however,
computational issues concerning implementation of the
proposed semantic models are not explored. Accord-
ingly the volume is directed to those with well-devel-
oped research interests in formal methods, focusing on
modeling a variety of NP phenomena. Other themes
explored within these fine-grained treatments of quan-

tificational phenomena include the empirical adequacy
of GQ for such NP constructions as plurals and mass
terms, and the integration of GQ theory with logics for
intensional contexts and discourse analysis. In each
case the task is to find a logic that captures the struc-
tures we use in language, rather than offer a reduction-
istic analysis.
Barwise, in his contribution &amp;quot;Noun phrases, GQ,
and anaphora&amp;quot;, introduces the conception of a dynamic
model for variable assignment (a model for a speaker&apos;s
production of utterances with anaphora). On this new,
&amp;quot;better&amp;quot; formal semantics, semantic values take the
form of constraints upon the input and output variable
assignments that are part of a sentence&apos;s denotation.
The notion of constraint captures the idea that language
users must interpret variable assignments on the basis
of incomplete or partial information. Combining the
representation of constraints as partial variable assign-
ments with Barwise&apos;s dynamic interpretations, we get a
picture of the gradual build-up of pronominal anteced-
ents. When two sentences are combined to form a
discourse, the output assignment for the first is matched
with the input assignment for the second. Thus, the
co-indexing of NPs is mediated by the set-theoretic
composition of input and output assignments. Barwise
extends GQ theory to handle the puzzles of singular
reference and restricted NPs in &amp;quot;donkey&amp;quot; sentences
(&amp;quot;Every man who owns a donkey beats it&amp;quot;) and related
phenomena that were not resolved in the original GQ
paper. In fact the dependent/antecedent relation his
model develops applies to such non-pronominal rela-
tions as reference via other and a singular NP in simple
comparatives (e.g., &amp;quot;John is taller than every other
logician.&amp;quot;) (Recent work on the Candide system re-
ported by Pollack and Pereira (1988) implements a
theoretically similar approath to non-compositional in-
teractions of semantic interpretation with pragmatic
context in determination of NP reference.)
Rooth&apos;s paper picks up on this theme and develops
the case for a systematic isomorphism between Kamp&apos;s
discourse representation semantics (1981), in which a
separate, intermediate level of discourse structure is
introduced, and an interpretive model of Heim&apos;s (1982)
&amp;quot;file-change semantics&amp;quot;, similar to Barwise&apos;s dynamic
model. In both accounts, indefinite NPs are treated as
introducing free variables, not quantifiers as in the GQ
analysis. Rooth&apos;s comparison finds that the theory of
&amp;quot;indefinites as variables&amp;quot; is not in fact essential to the
empirical success of Kamp&apos;s and Heim&apos;s analysis of
anaphora and conversational implicature.
Model-theoretic semantics has traditionally been
conducted without regard to the computational com-
plexity of the denotational assignments. The Montague
tradition builds up interpretations of expressions in
accordance with rules for compositionality that ignore
the computational complexity of the language. Van
Benthem&apos;s methodological premise for his &amp;quot;Towards a
computational semantics&amp;quot; is that basic terms in natural
language should correspond to procedurally simple in-
terpretations. Van Benthem uses the hierarchy of au-
tomata as his benchmark for complexity, and seeks out
those natural language constructions whose semantic
interpretations require jumps in the hierarchy. Quanti-
fiers are characterized by the automata that control
acceptance of strings describing the algebraic properties
of a domain of discourse. First-order quantifiers emerge
as those that may be &amp;quot;computed&amp;quot; by acyclic finite state
machines; the knowledge of domain cardinality required
for interpretation of GQ-like most and several leads to
the introduction of memory via push-down automata.
Full Turing-machine functionality is required for some
attempts to represent classificatory properties as com-
parative quantifiers (e.g., interpreting the attribute tall
as taller than most).
Van Benthem contemplates the extension of this
compositional semantics to modal operators (beginning
with negation), and in an extended appendix considers
the prospects for relating semantic complexity to a
realistic account of learnability and mental processing.
Each paper in this anthology is valuable for extend-
ing the published theoretical results by some of the
leading researchers in the field. The treatments are
penetrating, both in the formal understanding of noun
phrases in their multifarious forms, and the illumination
of recent alternative domains for the model-theoretic
structures that capture a wide range of the expressive
power of natural language.
