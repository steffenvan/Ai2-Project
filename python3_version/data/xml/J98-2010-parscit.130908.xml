As computer science continues to study human language and its importance to system
development, the field of linguistics will undoubtedly play a necessary and crucial
role in ensuring that system design is sensitive to the intricacies and complexity of
language in carrying out joint actions. To this end, Linguistic Concepts and Methods in
CSCW provides us with perhaps our first detailed study of potential links between
linguistics and the emerging field of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW).
Editors John H. Connolly and Lyn Pemberton have geared this collection of 15 chapters
to those interested in either linguistics or CSCW, and the book begins with an excellent
summary of both fields that could be used as stand-alone reading for any introductory
course on linguistics or collaborative computing.
Though many chapters of this book contain strong, productive links between the
two disciplines, CSCW specialists may find certain chapters lacking in their applicabil-
ity to the design of collaborative computing systems. As someone fairly well-grounded
in CSCW research, I was confused about the focus of the first few chapters, which
seemed to conflate CSCW and the general field of computer science. For example, in
the second chapter, &amp;quot;Linguistics and task analysis in computer supported cooperative
work,&amp;quot; Christine Cheepen and James Monaghan offer their analysis of business let-
ters produced by a single author in a London solicitor&apos;s office as a predictive model
for improving the reliability of speech-driven word processing programs. While this
chapter is certainly interesting, speech recognition programs are usually intended for
individual users composing texts in isolation, and it is not readily apparent from their
discussion what application, if any, their research has to CSCW.
In the third chapter, &amp;quot;Spoken language and speech synthesis in computer sup-
ported cooperative work,&amp;quot; Katherine Morton explores the role that computerized
speech synthesis might play in CSCW design. But once again, this topic is never firmly
related to how people use computer systems to coordinate joint activities. In her dis-
cussion, Morton argues that speech synthesis programs that accurately read textual
information could provide the advantages of speech by conveying pragmatic effect,
while also taking advantage of narrow bandwidth requirements for transmission of
textual information. Her bandwidth argument has some merits, but it seems dubious
to me that synthetic speech generated from electronic text could convey much of the
&amp;quot;human-ness&amp;quot; that Morton feels natural speech provides to communicative interaction.
But as one continues through the book in a linear fashion, the link to CSCW be-
comes gradually more apparent, as in Stephanie Robertson&apos;s chapter, &amp;quot;The contribution
of genre to computer supported cooperative work.&amp;quot; Drawing on Swales&apos;s (1986) con-

cept of real-life genres, Robertson argues that a firm understanding of task-oriented
genres used in joint activities not only can illuminate our knowledge of workplace
practices, but also can serve as an explicit basis for designing certain CSCW applica-
tions. A curious omission from her discussion, however, is the debate within CSCW
during the past decade about the problem of trying to mirror patterns of human
language in systems architecture—mainly the various reactions to Terry Winograd&apos;s
(1988) language/action perspective and its implementation in the Coordinator system.
Still, Robertson&apos;s approach moves us closer to the realm of CSCW.
This closer link with CSCW continues in subsequent chapters, such as that by
Alison Newlands, Anne Anderson, and Jim Mullin entitled &amp;quot;Dialog structure and co-
operative task performance in two CSCW environments.&amp;quot; Here the authors draw on
the work of Herbert Clark and his colleagues on how people achieve mutual knowl-
edge in conversation and how they often alter their &amp;quot;grounding&amp;quot; techniques when
using different media. Clark&apos;s work has had enormous influence on CSCW research
in recent years, and in this chapter, Newlands, Anderson, and Mullin use his notion of
grounding as an analytical framework for exploring patterns of communication in two
different electronic media—one a text-based synchronous messaging system, and the
other a video/audio-based communication system. While there is insufficient room
in this review to summarize their findings, the authors conclude that for &amp;quot;some tasks
in some settings, fairly low technology solutions might be adequate for delivering
effective outcomes, as users will adopt communicative strategies which exploit the
available communication resources to achieve effective cooperation. Their motivation
and satisfaction, however, are likely to be influenced by the supportive or restrictive
nature of the communicative context&amp;quot; (p. 60).
The next two chapters—&amp;quot;A language of cooperation?&amp;quot; by Anthony Clarke, John
Connolly, Steven Garner, and Hilary Palinen and &amp;quot;Some grammatical characteristics of
spoken dialog in a CSCW context&amp;quot; by John Connolly—offer the reader fairly detailed
analyses of linguistic data obtained from a single CSCW research project. Clarke and
colleagues examine dialogues at the discourse level between product design students
in two conditions—one using full speech and video communication with a common
sketchpad, and another using only the sketchpad and the speech channel. Employing
word-frequency and content analyses, the authors found linguistic evidence of cooper-
ative behavior in both conditions, though strangely they found no category of speech
acts—such as declarative unilateral and cooperative acts—that might be classed as
&amp;quot;cooperative&amp;quot; (p. 67). In his chapter, Connolly uses random samples from the same
data set, but takes us to the deeper level of grammatical structure, examining such
features as structural integrity and the use of pronominal subjects and adverbials. He
concludes that while the dialogues are filled with ill-formed and grammatically incor-
rect clauses, the language of the conversations exhibits a &amp;quot;functional resilience&amp;quot; that
helped move the design projects along with little need for conversational repair.
Perhaps the most interesting chapter from a theoretical standpoint is &amp;quot;A semantic
framework for computer supported cooperative work&amp;quot; by Pat Healey and Carl Vogel,
which offers a formal semantic model of communication between people of disparate
backgrounds and worldviews. While acknowledging past criticism of formal models in
CSCW research, Healey and Vogel feel such models can provide &amp;quot;productive insights
into the structural complexities of natural language&amp;quot; (p. 91), especially if they take into
account the ontological pluralism of communicative agents. In contrast to past seman-
tic theory that has presumed individuals to be ontologically transparent, Healey and
Vogel seek to map how ontological differences are managed in the information flows
between individuals with widely different conceptualizations of a particular situation.
To do so, they draw on Seligman and Barwise&apos;s (1993) Channel Theory to argue that

successful communication is not the result of intersecting individual ontologies, but
instead &amp;quot;the articulation and evolution of channels between agents&amp;quot; (p. 100). A hall-
mark of Healey and Vogel&apos;s formal model is that dialogue and joint actions between
two or more individuals can reach a stable point in which disparate conceptualizations
coexist. Though Healey and Vogel do not link their model specifically to system de-
sign, they believe it does provide a semantic framework for conducting more detailed
task analysis and ethnographic studies that in turn can impact CSCW design. It is an
interesting chapter that helps explain, for example, how symbolic convergence might
occur in multidisciplinary design teams, even though individual team members still
hold divergent views of the emerging object.
Continuing in this theoretical vein, Julian Newman argues, in his chapter &amp;quot;Semi-
otics, information and cooperation,&amp;quot; that CSCW research suffers from an inadequate
theoretical perspective on the concept of &amp;quot;information.&amp;quot; To address this problem, New-
man briefly summarizes several theories of information that have informed the field
of computer science over the past few decades, and in the end, he favors Nauta&apos;s
(1972) Cybernetic-Semiotic framework as most suitable for relating the &amp;quot;ethnographic
and technocratic strands&amp;quot; of CSCW research (p. 120).
The next two chapters—&amp;quot;Sociolinguistic inquiry + situation theory = contribution
to CSCW?&amp;quot; by Duska Rosenberg and &amp;quot;Telltales and overhearers: Participant roles in
electronic mail communication&amp;quot; by Lyn Pemberton—take a sociolinguistic perspective
on CSCW. As the title would suggest, Rosenberg&apos;s chapter blends the qualitative meth-
ods of ethnomethodology with the mathematical formalism of situation theory in order
to link the social and technological aspects of systems design. But unlike some other
language perspectives, Rosenberg&apos;s intent is not to mirror social structure in actual
system architecture, but instead to inform design &amp;quot;by explicitly expressing the bound-
aries of technological solutions to human concerns&amp;quot; (p. 123). While acknowledging
potential criticisms of applying mathematical formalism to social contexts, Rosenberg
believes situation theory can provide a uniform framework encompassing the con-
cerns of computer scientists, linguists, and social scientists in the design of CSCW
systems. Pemberton&apos;s chapter on e-mail uses a pragmatic perspective to compare the
role of participants in spoken, paper-based, and electronic communication. Though
production roles are similar across all three media, Pemberton argues that e-mail re-
cipients are often faced with ambiguous response roles depending on whether they
are addressed directly or listed under Cc: or Bcc: in the e-mail header. Pemberton
believes that understanding the complexity of roles in e-mail communication not only
can provide insight into breakdowns in group communication, but can also inform
design of future groupware applications.
One of the more interesting chapters in terms of system design is that by John
Levine and Chris Mellish on the Collaborative Requirements Capture Tool (CORECT)
project being developed at the University of Edinburgh Department of Artificial Intel-
ligence in cooperation with other corporate and academic interests. Using natural lan-
guage generation tools, the CORECT system creates documents from a central knowl-
edge database that are individualized for the specific information needs of various
participants—such as customers, salespersons, and systems engineers—in the design
of electronic testing systems. Using CORECT, participants can request an overview of
the design&apos;s progress geared to their own level of interest and expertise, selectively
filtering out information that is irrelevant to their individual concerns. It is a highly
ambitious, complex project that is still under development, but the authors believe
that such a system will solve a basic problem in CSCW research—how to make the
accumulating mass of information in multiauthor knowledge bases accessible in intel-
ligible, natural language form to users of different perspectives and backgrounds.

Another interesting chapter is &amp;quot;An interactive spoken dialog interface to virtual
worlds&amp;quot; by Christophe Godereaux and colleagues at the Universite de Caen. As the
title suggests, this chapter describes a prototype interface to the DIVE virtual reality
system at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science that allows participants to use
voice commands instead of a mouse to navigate through the virtual realm. The authors
describe in a fair amount of detail their statistical analysis of an initial dialogue corpus,
how this analysis helped shape design of the system architecture, and plans for future
development, including the ability to create and move objects in the virtual landscape
using nothing but the spoken word.
The collection concludes with two chapters on the role that interlanguage linguis-
tics might play in CSCW research. First, Jeremy Fox presents a short chapter, &amp;quot;Com-
puter mediated communication in foreign language learning,&amp;quot; in which he outlines
three phases in the development of computer-assisted language learning (CALL). In
particular, Fox believes the realization that second language learning is best accom-
plished through collaborative methods and group communication might have some
interest for those in the field of CSCW. Larry Selinker has a similar goal in mind in
&amp;quot;Understanding the &apos;good and bad language learner&apos;: CSCW as a necessary tool,&amp;quot; in
which he provides a brief summary of various concepts in interlanguage linguistics
and how they might relate to group CALL.
Overall, Linguistic Concepts and Methods in CSCW provides an interesting portrait of
various perspectives on the role that linguistics might play in CSCW research. Several
of the chapters provide detailed analyses of human dialogue at various linguistic levels
and how their results might inform systems design, while others describe prototype
systems designed to solve language problems in group communication. As noted at
the beginning of this review, however, some of the chapters make precarious links
to central issues and existing research in the field of CSCW. As a result, most CSCW
researchers will find only certain chapters of critical interest, while those steeped in
computational linguistics may feel like they are treading on all-too-familiar ground
in many chapters. For those fairly new to either or both fields, however, Linguistic
Concepts and Methods in CSCW does provide some interesting synergy between the two
disciplines and much fertile ground in developing ideas for future research.
