<bodyText confidence="0.999534">
In many cases, museum documentation
consists of semi-structured data records
with free text fields, which usually refer
to contents of other fields, in the same
data record, as well as in others. Most of
these references comprise of person and
place names, as well as time specifica-
tions. It is, therefore, important to rec-
ognize those in the first place. We report
on techniques and results of partial pars-
ing in an ongoing project, using a large
database on German goldsmith art. The
texts are encoded according to the TEI
guidelines and expanded by structured de-
scriptions of named entities and time spec-
ifications. These are building blocks for
event descriptions, at which the next step
is aiming. The identification of named en-
tities allows the data to be linked with var-
ious resources within the domain of cul-
tural heritage and beyond. For the latter
case, we refer to a biological database and
present a solution in a transdisciplinary
perspective by means of the CIDOC Con-
ceptual Reference Model (CRM).

1 Specific Goals of Content Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987938775511">
When we speak of museum documentation, we
address a wide variety of document types. First
of all, there are acquisition and inventory lists or
index cards, which contain more or less detailed
records of museum objects. Often these are ac-
companied by photographs, restoration records,
and further archival records. If curators prepare
exhibitions, usually they provide catalogs by com-
piling data from sources, such as those just men-
tioned, and by contributing short articles on the ex-
hibits. Last but not least there are scholarly mono-
graphs on museum objects.
With the introduction of information technol-
ogy in museums and cultural heritage institu-
tions, such records have been stored in (relational)
database systems and content management sys-
tems. At the beginning — with the exception
of bibliographic records — there were no meta-
data standards at all in the museum world. Since
the 1990s, many metadata schemata have been
proposed for the field of cultural heritage, some
with very detailed classification features for spe-
cific object types1. There is still an active dis-
cussion about metadata schemata and their stan-
dardisation, as can be seen with recent proposals
for CDWA Lite, museumdat and their combination
(Stein and Coburn, 2008).
Today, access to museum documentation via the
World Wide Web has become a matter of course,
in particular, if the documentation has been the
result of publicly funded research projects. Nat-
urally, printed editions are still a very important
medium of publication. However, in many cases
the data are too voluminous, which means only
abridged versions are published in print, while
the full data are available only in digital form.
Web access allows many means to retrieve and
print the data, with very little cost involved. Us-
ing controlled language defined in terminologies
and formal ontologies, different forms of “intelli-
gent search” come within reach as well as inter-
active evaluation and visualisation methods. But
it is not only access to the data alone; interactiv-
ity opens up possibilites for Wiki-style annotation
and scholarly communication, as well as forums
for the general public. Furthermore, the technol-
ogy provides methods to link the data with other
resources, e.g. authority files containing biograph-
ical or geographical data.

A common situation in museum documenta-
tion is characterized by the fact that it is cen-
tered around museum objects, i.e. there is a
database system or content management system,
which contains structured descriptions of museum
objects and further information about their cre-
ators, provenance, use, and so forth, according
to given descriptive and administrative metadata
schemata. Besides fields in such data records en-
forcing (more or less strictly defined) data types,
e.g. for inventory numbers, there are free text
fields which contain important background infor-
mation about persons, objects, materials, stylistic
festures, etc. without any further tagging. Ba-
sically, the free text fields are open for any kind
of information which cannot be expressed in the
strictly defined parts of the schema. Therefore,
overall, the given data records at best provide a
semi-structured representation.
The free text fields and their relations to other
fields, in particular, indicate a clear need for con-
tent analysis. Firstly, named entitities must be
identified, in particular person and geographic
place names. For instance, there may be a data
field for the creator of a work of art and another
one for the place where this work was created, ad-
ditionally one or more free text fields which talk
about the artist’s family relations, when he came to
the mentioned place and how long he stayed there,
etc. As this example indicates, at least a second
type of linguistic expressions, time specifications
in a variety of forms, ought to be recognized. In
the future, we would like to identify event descrip-
tions and how they are related among each other,
for which the recognition of named entitites and
time specifications is a first step.
In the following sections we describe our ap-
proach to address these problems. The next sec-
tion outlines characteristic features of the data
with a reflection on their typicality. Section three
is the central technical part presenting the shallow
text analysis techniques we use — word class tag-
ging, recognition of temporal specifications, place
and person names — and the utilization of name
authorities for lexical and semantic enrichment.
In the fourth section we show how the results
achieved so far can be used to construct event-
based shallow semantic representations related to
the CIDOC CRM. Furthermore, the CRM is also
the key to transdisciplinary approaches in museum
documentation as outlined in the final section with
an example between biology and cultural history.
2 Characteristics of the Data
We are working2 with data which resulted from a
project on goldsmith art in Nuremberg, executed
at the German National Museum, providing de-
scriptions of more than 6700 objects, 2290 artists,
many locations, etc. Furthermore, with the mu-
seum’s content management system we can access
many more data records on sculptures and paint-
ings — with a particular emphasis on the work of
Albrecht D¨urer — up to 1800. The latter corpora
were accessed primarily to verify the general use-
fulness of the approach that will be presented in
the following sections.
For many projects in the field of cultural her-
itage in Germany, a condition for public fund-
ing has been to use the MIDAS3 data schema
(Heusinger, 1989) in combination with a spe-
cific database implementation (HiDA). MIDAS
defines a framework of record types with appro-
priate properties for terms (thesauri), time, place,
artists, other persons and organizations, objects,
content and signs, events, sources, and adminis-
trative data. The goal of MIDAS was to establish
a de facto standard based on the current documen-
tation practice in museums. Depending on what
is to be documented, the appropriate record types
can be selected. HiDA is a data administration sys-
tem, which provides a graphical user interface for
data input, editing, and search; it stores the records
not in a database system, but in a system of files,
one for each type, in a proprietary format. For
this reason and problems in handling the user in-
terface, many HiDA-encoded data are now being
converted to an XML representation. For the free
texts, we decided to follow the encoding rules of
the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) (Ide and Vero-
nis, 1995)4 for text bodies.
The actual encoding of the XML-transformed
data sets is still very close to HiDA as far as
the “classes” and properties are concerned. Cur-
rently, the data are in the process of being trans-
formed to the emerging museumdat/CDWA Lite

standard (Stein and Coburn, 2008)5, which in turn
is compatible with CIDOC’s Conceptual Refer-
ence Model (Doerr, 2003)6. The CRM is the for-
mal reference ontology, which defines the con-
ceptual background for the semantic representa-
tions resulting from content analysis. We refer to
the CRM as a formally defined reference ontology
because with the “Erlangen CRM”7 we provided
is a description logic version of the latest stan-
dard (ISO 21127:2009), implemented in OWL-DL
(Goerz et al., 2008).
As for the content of the free text fields, the texts
contain well-formed sentences in the linguistic
sense, although in some cases, one can find elliptic
formulations in telegraphic style. In most cases,
the texts refer to defined data record fields (per-
sons, creatorship, object properties, bibliographic
data), providing additional information, for which
there is no other place in the schema. A great deal
of the texts talk about family and other relations
between persons, about creatorship, techniques,
actions of the mentioned persons other than the
creation of the artwork, and the general cultural
context. As in early modern German there is a
great orthographic variation even in writing per-
son and place names, many of the texts suggest
disambiguations of different kinds. Nevertheless,
there are still many writing variants of named en-
tities. Furthermore, many texts contain quotations
from reference works, some of which are too old
to obey the actual orthographic standards.
It is important to notice that the actual data we
have to deal with are nevertheless a typical ex-
ample of the state of the art of documentation in
many cultural heritage institutions. Hence, the
techniques of content analysis and annotation pre-
sented in the following will be of a general utility
in many similar projects.

tags of the module namesdates for person and
place names. For processing, all texts in the free
text fields of a MIDAS file — e.g., the “object” file
containing all object descriptions in the “database”
— are merged in a single multi-text TEI file. Each
text from a data field is represented as a &lt;text&gt;
element where the text proper without further an-
notations is contained in its subordinate &lt;body&gt;
element. The association between the TEI text el-
ements and the orginal MIDAS data fields is as-
sured by unique XML identifiers in xml:id at-
tributes. The “raw” text data are transformed au-
tomatically into the initial TEI representation in a
rather straightforward way by a script. No further
internal structuring is provided at this stage; anno-
tations are added by subsequent processing steps.
Shallow parsing for place names and time spec-
ifications is based on sets of chunk rules imple-
mented with the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG)
formalism8 which are executed by Prolog. There
are grammars for person and place names and for
time specifications; these sets of grammar rules
define three partial “parsers”. For the three parsers
there is only one pass, and there is in principle no
restriction on the order in which they are applied.
The parsing results of each of the parsers are rep-
resented as feature structures, which are then con-
verted to TEI tags and inserted into the file by a
separate software component. At this stage, there
is no recognition and resolution of anaphoric ref-
erences, such as pronouns. In a second and inde-
pendent pass, a lookup of person and place names
in Name Authority files is executed and the results
are collected in local files. There is no filtering ap-
plied to the lookup because, at this point, no spe-
cial knowledge about these resources is available.

3.1 Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999795">
First of all, the texts encoded conforming to the
TEI guidelines are annotated with word class tags
and lemmata (base forms) by a POS tagger. Lem-
matisation is very useful in languages with a rich
inflectional system, such as German. For POS tag-
ging, we use the Stuttgart TreeTagger9 with the
STTS tagset which provides categories for Ger-
man words and delimiters.

The resulting TEI tags express morphosyntac-
tic descriptions. Of particular interest are the tags
&lt;w&gt; for encoding words and &lt;c&gt; for individ-
ual punctuation marks which are very well suited
for encoding tokens: Both can accept an attribute
type for the determination of the word or charac-
ter class. Lemmata are encoded with the attribute

3.2 Time Specifications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986684210526">
The “temporal” grammar/parser recognizes a
broad variety of temporal expressions built up
from days, weeks, months, seasons of the year,
years, decades, and centuries.10 Time specifica-
tions may be given as absolute or relative.
Absolute time specifications describe unique
time points or intervals on the time line, such as
calendar dates (e.g. 28. August 1749) and open or
closed time spans (e.g. bis 1832, up to 1832). Fur-
thermore, modifying particles are recognized, e.g.
Mitte 1749 (midyear 1749) or Ende M¨arz 1832
(end of March 1832).
To determine the missing data in relative time
specifications, such as drei Wochen sp¨ater (three
weeks later), a kind of anaphoric resolution
method is applied. Therefore, we keep track of
all occurences of temporal expressions. For reso-
lution, we choose the most recently mentioned at
the appropriate level (day, month, year).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984147">
3.3 Places
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977466333333334">
The normal case of place specifications in the
goldsmith corpus consists of a geographic place
name or a preposition followed by a place name.
In some cases there are also enumerations of place
names. We distinguish between a named entity
and the corresponding linguistic phrase. Named
entities are looked up in a local dictionary which
is built from entries in Name Authorities.
Before lexical lookup, a procedure is executed
which prevents the annotation of lower case words
as named entities. It implements the simple
heuristics that — even composite — named en-
tities are designated by words beginning with a
capital letter, but not each word beginning with a
capital letter is a named entity as in English. In
German, a noun must be written with its first letter
in upper case.
Each named entity is associated with one out
of ten geographical types to avoid aggregations of

incompatible types as in die St¨adte M¨unchen und
Berlin und Finnland (the cities Munich, Berlin and
Finland). On the other hand, certain words such
as city, town, settlement, etc. are associated with
such a type (“city”) to be used as a constraint on
subsequent proper nouns.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.938508">
3.4 Persons
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999466346153846">
Parsing ofperson names is much more difficult be-
cause they are more complex and there is a con-
siderably larger variation than with place names.
Whereas, usually, composite place names are lex-
icalized, this is not a real option for person names.
Every person in German speaking countries has
at least one first and one surname, optionally
amended by further forenames, appellations of no-
bility or ancestry or generation. We do not regard
titles and forms of address such as K¨onig (king)
or Herr (Mister) as parts of names — in spite of
the fact that according to German law the title of
Doktor (doctor) is a part of the name.
For name parsing, the constituents of names are
divided into four categories: forenames, surnames,
copula, and generation appellations. The class of
copula subsumes many particles which serve as
predicates of nobility or ancestry, e.g. von, van der
or French/Spanish/Italian de la. The category of
generation appellations contains words and num-
berings to distinguish persons with the same name,
e.g. Karl V., Albrecht D¨urer der ¨Altere.
There are several sources of ambiguities with
person names the grammar has to deal with, as
well w.r.t. the correct interpretation of their parts
as regarding their reference:

the ordering of name parts.
• The use of a comma to separate surname and

Therefore we use dictionaries for the four cat-

may be members of several categories, if there are
several possibilities of interpretation. The dictio-

first and surnames, several name lists were com-
piled into one dictionary file from lists available

To recognize person names containing very rare
first and surnames, as well as writing variants
which are not contained in the lexicon, we use a
system of syntactic and semantic cues — based on
statistical analyses of the texts — which indicate
the occurence of a name at a specific location (cf.
table).

<bodyText confidence="0.9999828">
Statistical analysis of the goldsmith corpus has
given clear evidence for three groups of words
whose occurrence indicates an immediate follow-
ing person name: Appellations of professions, ap-
pellations plus titles, and relations between per-
sons. A relation between persons is regarded as a
cue only if certain particles occur immediately be-
fore or after it. The word sequence “Tochter von”
(daughter of) is a good example of such a cue for
a subsequent person name.
In a first step, the name parts and the cues are
labelled separately. In a second pass, whenever a
cue or a name part is encountered, an algorithm to
assemble the parts into complete person names is
run. It tries to match the current word sequence
with different patterns of name parts which con-
stitute valid person names, i.e. it applies different
finite state machines11 to the word sequence. The
longest sequence recognized by a finite state ma-
chine is assumed to be a name (see Table 2).

<bodyText confidence="0.941948636363636">
Name authorities can be directly accessed through
the dictionary interfaces of the place and person
name parsers. To accelerate the search for entries,
the retrieved data are stored in local dictionary
files, one for each name authority. The dictionary
files can be generated either during the recognition
process or off-line. To keep the local data up to
date, the generation process should to be repeated
from time to time, at least for some of the men-
tioned resources.
3.5.2 Name Authorities for Metadata
Harvesting
Metadata harvesting has been implemented as a
separate process; it consists of the search for anno-
tations of named entities in the TEI files, of query-
ing name authorities and collecting the metadata
through special interfaces, encoding in an appro-
priate format and storing in local files. We do not
rank name authorities and the content of the meta-
data; its structure and degree of detail are taken as
retrieved. However, with each data set the list of
IDs of the tagged findings in the TEI file is stored.

Temporal expressions are encoded with the

The tag &lt;placeName&gt; is used to anno-
tate place expressions as a whole. To label
the named entities contained within, the TEI

there may be a refinement by means of the ten ge-
ographic types mentioned in 3.3 with the attribute

On the goldsmith corpus with a test set of about
2000 word types, a precision of 81.8% and a recall
of 72.6% was achieved with the described level of
granularity, i.e., accounting for the distinction of
first and last names and geographic types.
If these distinctions are dropped, as in many
other systems, precision increases to 83.0% and
recall to 82.6%.
A separate evaluation of the parsers (in paren-

Depending on the choice of name authorities
used for lexicon generation, and due to a high de-

been left out, because it led to a considerable de-

4 Building Blocks for Event Recognition

<bodyText confidence="0.999994411764706">
With parsing results for person and place names
and time specifications, we have a first-level
partial semantic representation of text chunks,
which could be combined into larger representa-
tion structures. However, considering the char-
acteristics of the given free texts and the state of
the art in computational linguistics, it would be
presumptuous to aim at a deep semantic analysis.
Nevertheless, under the assumption of composi-
tionality, i.e., the assumption that semantic rep-
resentations of larger units are to be composed
from those of their parts in a systematic way, it
is possible to assemble partial semantic represen-
tations. In particular, we are interested in identi-
fying events and the involved actors, objects, and
instruments. Event recognition in texts has been

lar in combination with text mining.18 In previous
work (Fischer et al., 1996; B¨ucher et al., 2002), we
augmented a chart-based chunk parser with an in-
cremental construction procedure for (partial) Dis-
course Representation Structures (DRSs). DRSs
are semantic representations which contain a list
of discourse referents, introduced by named enti-
ties or definite noun phrases, and a body, which
consists of a possibly complex logical form repre-
senting the meaning of the given part of speech19.
For events, we use a neo-Davidsonian represen-
tation, i.e., the corresponding verb is a one-place
predicate whose argument is a discourse referent
representing an event, conjoined with binary re-
lations for the thematic roles. For example, the
sentence “Albrecht D¨urer painted a self-portrait
in 1500 in Nuremberg” would get a semantic rep-
resentation in which — extremely simplified —
e would be the discourse referent for the event,
paint(e) the representation of the event, and ac-
tor(e,a), object(e,s), time(e,1500), etc. constitute
the body, where a and s are the discourse referents
for the artist and the self-portrait, resp. DRSs are
reaching beyond sentence limits and can in prin-
ciple be combined into larger and larger discourse
structures. Therefore, they are appropriate repre-
sentations on which reference resolution mecha-
nisms, such as those described in (Fischer et al.,
1996) can be built. In our current work, a cen-
tral activity is to port this method and its imple-
mentation to the museum documentation domain
and enrich it by collocational analysis as in (Smith,
2002).
The representation of events is not only an ex-
tremely important key to content analysis, but also
the pivot which connects various objects, persons,
places, with each other, making a variety of con-
nections explicit, which are implicitly contained
in the data fields and free texts of records of dif-
ferent types. It, therefore, becomes an obvious
goal to enrich such relational structures with fur-
ther information elements from other cultural her-
itage resources — beyond name authorities. In our
particular application, access to Getty’s Art and
Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), to other museum
and collection databases or online auction cata-
logs would be obvious. Unfortunately, many of

these resources use idiosyncratic data formats just
as MIDAS mentioned above. At best, they refer
to a formal representation of their respective do-
main, in terms of a so-called “formal domain on-
tology”, a representative hierarchical structure of
concepts, properties and constraints of the domain.
However, to satisfy the desideratum of linking di-
verse data collections, an intermediate level of in-
teroperability is required. A well proven approach
for such information integration tasks is to link the
different domain ontologies to a generic reference
ontology, which contains just the fundamental and
most general concepts and properties for a wide
variety of applications. In fact, for the field of
cultural heritage, CIDOC’s Conceptual Reference
Model (CRM) is such a reference ontology. It is
worthwhile to notice that, among other things, the
CRM emphasizes the event-driven perspective, in
fact, events are the glue in CRM which connects
all documentation elements. As a first step, we
have already implemented a generator for CRM
instances from TEI-conformant texts with named
entity annotations.

5 Transdisciplinary Aspects
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983346153846">
Coming back to our project on goldsmith art doc-
umentation, we recognize clues in the data, which
point beyond the domain of cultural history: there
are goblets and centerpieces (epergnes) showing
sculptered animals, such as lizards and beetles.
Two of the documented objects exhibit a beau-
tiful stag beetle, which induced interesting ques-
tions about those insects, not only on their icono-
graphic significance, but also on their determina-
tion and classification in biology, the distribution
of species, etc. This illustrates that there is a
need to connect with further knowledge sources,
such as resources from biology, biodiversity re-
search, etc. For example, we may want to con-
sult a database such as BIODAT, maintained by
the natural history museum Koenig in Bonn. Con-
sidering the completely different scientific back-
ground and the different perspectives in descrip-
tion, this task seems to be very ambitious, to say
the least. Whereas the stag beetle in the foot of the
goblet is described in terms of art history and met-
allurgy, we find a completely different description
of a pinned stag beetle in the BIODAT data base.
We may be lucky to identify it there if we know
the precise species name in advance, but in many
cases, there is a significant chance that the match-

<bodyText confidence="0.999972902439024">
ing task will fail. At this point in time, we can only
provide a sketch in terms of an example how we
would approach this challenge. But it seems ob-
vious if we could find a general way to connect to
different description systems, we would approach
the long-term goal of an “epistemic web”.
Recent efforts showed that there is in fact a
way to a solution, indicated by the term “trans-
disciplinarity”; first results have been presented
at the first meeting of the CIDOC working group
on “Transdisciplinary Approaches in Documen-
tation”20. Originating from philosophy of sci-
ence (Mittelstrass, 2002), transdisciplinarity con-
centrates on problems, which cannot be solved
within a single disciplinary framework. It takes
a new view on the unity of science, focussing on
scientific rationality, not systems. Taking into ac-
count that for all sciences there are common ele-
ments in the practice of argumentation and justifi-
cation, transdisciplinarity is a research principle in
the first place. Its emphasis on rational language
use in science offers a clue to the field of docu-
mentation; as a starting point, our methodological
focus is first of all on data integration . Taking
into account that transdisciplinarity addresses the
practice of research, this framework should sup-
port an action and event perspective on a generic
level, i.e. for the tasks of classification, represen-
tation, annotation, linking, etc.
In fact, we claim that the CIDOC CRM can play
the role of such a transdisciplinary framework;
at least for the stag beetle on goblets and still
life paintings, some other insects and also birds
on drawings and paintings, the modelling task
has already been performed successfully. For the
birds — hooded crows in Dutch winter scenes in
Brueghel paintings — our transdisciplinary mod-
elling effort provided a nice result for biodiversity
research as a side effect: During the “little ice age”
hooded crows lived in Western Europe, whereas
today they can only be found east of the Elbe river.

<abstract confidence="0.994635717948718">In many cases, museum documentation consists of semi-structured data records with free text fields, which usually refer to contents of other fields, in the same data record, as well as in others. Most of these references comprise of person and place names, as well as time specifications. It is, therefore, important to recognize those in the first place. We report on techniques and results of partial parsing in an ongoing project, using a large database on German goldsmith art. The texts are encoded according to the TEI guidelines and expanded by structured descriptions of named entities and time specifications. These are building blocks for event descriptions, at which the next step is aiming. The identification of named entities allows the data to be linked with various resources within the domain of cultural heritage and beyond. For the latter case, we refer to a biological database and present a solution in a transdisciplinary perspective by means of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM). 1 Specific Goals of Content Analysis When we speak of museum documentation, we address a wide variety of document types. First of all, there are acquisition and inventory lists or index cards, which contain more or less detailed records of museum objects. Often these are accompanied by photographs, restoration records, and further archival records. If curators prepare exhibitions, usually they provide catalogs by compiling data from sources, such as those just mentioned, and by contributing short articles on the exhibits. Last but not least there are scholarly monographs on museum objects.</abstract>

The latter corpora were accessed primarily to verify the general usefulness of the approach that will be presented in the following sections. For many projects in the field of cultural heritage in Germany, a condition for public funding has been to use the MIDAS3 data schema (Heusinger, 1989) in combination with a specific database implementation (HiDA). MIDAS defines a framework of record types with appropriate properties for terms (thesauri), time, place, artists, other persons and organizations, objects, content and signs, events, sources, and administrative data. The goal of MIDAS was to establish a de facto standard based on the current documentation practice in museums. Depending on what is to be documented, the appropriate record types can be selected. HiDA is a data administration system, which provides a graphical user interface for data input, editing, and search; it sto</context>

At best, they refer to a formal representation of their respective domain, in terms of a so-called “formal domain ontology”, a representative hierarchical structure of concepts, properties and constraints of the domain. However, to satisfy the desideratum of linking diverse data collections, an intermediate level of interoperability is required. A well proven approach for such information integration tasks is to link the different domain ontologies to a generic reference ontology, which contains just the fundamental</context>

At this point in time, we can only provide a sketch in terms of an example how we would approach this challenge. But it seems obvious if we could find a general way to connect to different description systems, we would approach the long-term goal of an “epistemic web”. Recent efforts showed that there is in fact a way to a solution, indicated by the term “transdisciplinarity”; first results have been presented at the first meeting of the CIDOC working group on “Transdisciplinary Approaches in Documentation”20. Originating from philosophy of science (Mittelstrass, 2002), transdisciplinarity concentrates on problems, which cannot be solved within a single disciplinary framework. It takes a new view on the unity of science, focussing on scientific rationality, not systems. Taking into account that for all sciences there are common elements in the practice of argumentation and justification, transdisciplinarity is a research principle in the first place. Its emphasis on rational language use in science offers a clue to the field of documentation; as a starting point, our methodological focus is first of all on data integration .

DRSs are reaching beyond sentence limits and can in principle be combined into larger and larger discourse structures. Therefore, they are appropriate representations on which reference resolution mechanisms, such as those described in (Fischer et al., 1996) can be built. In our current work, a central activity is to port this method and its implementation to the museum documentation domain and enrich it by collocational analysis as in (Smith, 2002). The representation of events is not only an extremely important key to content analysis, but also the pivot which connects various objects, persons, places, with each other, making a variety of connections explicit, which are implicitly contained in the data fields and free texts of records of different types. It, therefore, becomes an obvious goal to enrich such relational structures with further information elements from other cultural heritage resources — beyond name authorities.

At the beginning — with the exception of bibliographic records — there were no metadata standards at all in the museum world. Since the 1990s, many metadata schemata have been proposed for the field of cultural heritage, some with very detailed classification features for specific object types1. There is still an active discussion about metadata schemata and their standardisation, as can be seen with recent proposals for CDWA Lite, museumdat and their combination (Stein and Coburn, 2008). Today, access to museum documentation via the World Wide Web has become a matter of course, in particular, if the documentation has been the result of publicly funded research projects. Naturally, printed editions are still a very important medium of publication. However, in many cases the data are too voluminous, which means only abridged versions are published in print, while the full data are available only in digital form. Web access allows many means to retrieve and print the data, with very little cost involved. Using controlled language defined in terminologies and formal ontologies, </context>

We refer to the CRM as a formally defined reference ontology because with the “Erlangen CRM”7 we provided is a description logic version of the latest standard (ISO 21127:2009), implemented in OWL-DL (Goerz et al., 2008).

There is no filtering applied to the lookup because, at this point, no special knowledge about these resources is available. 3.1 Tagging First of all, the texts encoded conforming to the TEI guidelines are annotated with word class tags and lemmata (base forms) by a POS tagger. Lemmatisation is very useful in languages with a rich inflectional system, such as German. For POS tagging, we use the Stuttgart TreeTagger9 with the STTS tagset which provides categories for German words and delimiters. 8based on previous work by (Tantzen, 2004). 9Institute for Automatic Language Processing of the University of Stuttgart. The tagger is available at http: //www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/ corplex/TreeTagger/DecisionTreeTagger. html ; visited 03.12.2008. 3 The resulting TEI tags express morphosyntactic descriptions. Of particular interest are the tags &lt;w&gt; for encoding words and &lt;c&gt; for individual punctuation marks which are very well suited for encoding tokens: Both can accept an attribute type for the determination of the word or character class.
