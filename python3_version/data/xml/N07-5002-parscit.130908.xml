Statistical language models have recently been successfully applied to many information retrieval prob-
lems. A great deal of recent work has shown that statistical language models not only achieve superior
empirical performance, but also facilitate parameter tuning and provide a more principled way, in general,
for modeling various kinds of complex and non-traditional retrieval problems.
The purpose of this tutorial is to systematically review the recent progress in applying statistical language
models to information retrieval with an emphasis on the underlying principles and framework, empirically
effective language models, and language models developed for non-traditional retrieval tasks. Tutorial at-
tendees can expect to learn the major principles and methods of applying statistical language models to
information retrieval, the outstanding problems in this area, as well as obtain comprehensive pointers to
the research literature. The tutorial should appeal to both people working on information retrieval with an
interest in applying more advanced language models and those who have a background on statistical lan-
guage models and wish to apply them to information retrieval. Attendees will be assumed to know basic
probability and statistics.
The outline of the tutorial is as follows:

Champaign, where he also holds a joint appointment at the Institute for Genomic Biology and the Graduate
School of Library and Information Science. He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Nanjing Uni-
versity in 1990, and a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies from Carnegie Mellon University in
2002. He worked at Clairvoyance Corp. as a Research Scientist and, later, a Senior Research Scientist from
1997 to 2000. His research interests include information retrieval, text mining, natural language processing,
machine learning, and bioinformatics. He serves on the editorial board of ACM Transactions on Information
Systems, and is the program co-chair of ACM CIKM 2004 and NAACL HLT 2007. He is an invited partici-
pant of the National Academy of Engineering’s 2006 US Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. He received
an NSF CAREER Award in 2004, the ACM SIGIR 2004 Best Paper Award, and the 2004 Presidential Early
Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).
