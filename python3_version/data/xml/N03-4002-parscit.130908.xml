ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.998902181818182">
Alias-i ThreatTrackers are an advanced information access
application designed around the needs of analysts working through
a large daily data feed. ThreatTrackers help analysts decompose an
information gathering topic like the unfolding political situation in
Iraq into specifications including people, places, organizations and
relationships. These specifications are then used to collect and
browse information on a daily basis. The nearest related
technologies are information retrieval (search engines), document
categorization, information extraction and named entity
detection.ThreatTrackers are currently being used in the Total
Information Awareness program.

Alias-i ThreatTrackers are an advanced information access
application designed around the needs of analysts working
through a large daily data feed. ThreatTrackers help analysts
decompose an information gathering topic like the unfolding
political situation in Iraq into specifications including
people, places, organizations and relationships. These
specifications are then used to collect and browse
information on a daily basis. The nearest related
technologies are information retrieval (search engines),
document categorization, information extraction and named
entity detection.ThreatTrackers are currently being used in
the Total Information Awareness program.
ThreatTrackers have two major components, first is a
mentally natural organization of a data feed we call
Cognitive Indexing(tm), and second, a user interface which
combines data triage, browsing and ThreatTracker
authoring.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999530916666667">
Cognitive Indexing organizes text data feeds into mentally
natural units like people, events, things, organizations and
relationships. For example, the Cognitive Indexing
representation for an Entity like Osama bin Laden contains
pointers to all sentences in the data feed that mention him
Fig 4, including spelling variation (i.e. Usama) and
pronouns which refer to him. In future versions of the
system, the Cognitive Indexing representation of Osama will
include audio mentions of him as well as database entries for
him. In addition to coreference, Cognitive Indexing supports
standard key word lookup, relationship detection between
entities and analyst authored classes of Entities.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780777777778">
The ThreatTracker interface provides complete analyst control over
what is in a ThreatTracker, and provides multiple views into the
collected data. Included are sentence excerpt summaries, tables of
relationships between Entities and easy access to original source
documents. There is also a redundant information filter on
documents or sentences. ThreatTrackers allow analysts to create
new categories of Entities like “Chemical Weapons Precursors “
for use inside ThreatTrackers. Once created, ThreatTrackers serve
as a form of information triage against the data feed.
