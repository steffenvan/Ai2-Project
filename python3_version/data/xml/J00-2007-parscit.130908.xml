This monograph belongs to a literary species that flowers every time Chomsky comes
up with a new proposal and has as its aim to show that what is proposed is woefully
inadequate on empirical and theoretical grounds. This kind of literature has a ped-
agogical role to play in theoretical linguistics and card-carrying syntacticians should
read the book. However, over the years Chomsky&apos;s versions of syntactic theory have
become so irrelevant to natural language processing that computational linguists can
safely skip this book and the one it is a response to, Chomsky (1995).
But, as it is not a long book, some computational linguists might be interested
in reading the first chapters as a quick summary of early minimalism and the fourth
chapter as an introduction to the HPSG treatment of wh-constructions. After a brief intro-
ductory chapter, the authors summarize the Chomsky 1995 version of global economy
in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, they discuss two versions of local economy, that proposed
by Collins (1997) and the one developed by Yang (1997). They contrast the Minimalist
Program model with what they call the incremental interface correspondence model,
which is exemplified in several recent linguistic frameworks, from Montague grammar
to LFG, to GPSG, to TAGS, to cite only a few. In Chapter 4, they compare an account
of wh-constructions in Iranian Arabic according to a local version of economy to one
based on an HPSG local-constraint approach. The last chapter addresses issues of theory
construction in general.
The general argument developed in the second chapter is somewhat awkward: the
authors want to show that the three main economy principles proposed by Chomsky
(Procrastinate, the Smallest Derivation Principle, and &amp;quot;Have an Effect on Output&amp;quot;) are
unnecessary. They do this mainly by showing that other, more GB-like, mechanisms
could account for the same data. Given the limited amount of data discussed (a lot
of the discussion centers on the contrast between There seems to be somebody in the
room and *There seems somebody to be in the room), it would be rather astonishing if this
were not the case. We get here the familiar dialogue des sourds where one party points
out descriptive problems and alternatives whereas the other party is arguing about
&amp;quot;explanatory&amp;quot; adequacy. The discussion allows the authors to make a couple of points
about the computational complexity of the Minimalist Program proposal that would
certainly help scare away practically minded computer linguists, but as I said above,
I do not think they will be tempted. It makes also the usual points about Chomsky&apos;s
sloppiness and vagueness.

The third chapter looks at attempts to replace global economy by local economy,
a move that could help alleviate the computational problem. Johnson and Lappin
show that the proposal made by Collins does away, by and large, with the economy
approach as such and actually proposes local constraints, and that the proposal by
Yang is empirically and formally inadequate in that it proposes a metric that leads to
contradictory rankings. The authors then propose their own explicit account of raising
and expletive constructions in an incremental correspondence model. In general, I
sympathize with the authors&apos; complaints about the lack of rigor and explicitness of
syntactic work by the current followers of Chomsky. But I have to admit that to
compare a fully developed mature theory, such as HPSG, to something that cannot
be more than a sketch, such as minimalism, on the grounds of descriptive adequacy
strikes me as a bit facile. The discussion, however, brings out some valuable points
about the oddities of minimalist theory construction with respect to interpretable and
noninterpretable features, a distinction that in a derivational approach needs to be
made before the information to make it is available.
The fourth chapter discusses some wh-constructions in Iranian Arabic, a language
that has wh-words both in sentence initial position and in situ. The HPSG account given
seems adequate; minimalism as it stands seems to get into contradictions in the face
of this set of facts. The authors do a good job in summarizing the main points of the
HPSG approach for those of us that might have some trouble keeping all the various
features and their behavior straight.
In the last chapter, Johnson and Lappin address more-general issues. They point
out that while Chomsky always stresses Universal Grammar as determined by biolog-
ical properties of the brain, optimality of design as proposed in minimalism is rarely
a characteristic of biological systems. This is a short chapter and it is rather anecdo-
tal, but it raises important questions. The meager results of forty years of syntactic
theory constructions by bright and enthusiastic practitioners lead one to suspect that
there is something fundamentally wrong with the way the problem is being looked
at: to assume that simplicity and parsimony are part of universal grammar might
just be misguided. A degree of redundancy and independence of subparts might be
the necessary characteristics of a robust and continuously evolving system such as
language, and theories such as minimalism might be more harmful because they are
philosophically misguided than because they are descriptively inadequate.
