An important aspect of the interpretation of multimodal messages is the ability to identify when
the same object in the world is the referent of symbols in different modalities. To understand the
caption of a picture, for instance, one needs to identify the graphical symbols that are referred to
by names and pronouns in the natural language text. One way to think of this problem is in terms
of the notion of anaphora; however, unlike linguistic anaphoric inference, in which antecedents
for pronouns are selected from a linguistic context, in the interpretation of the textual part of
multimodal messages the antecedents are selected from a graphical context. Under this view,
resolving multimodal references is like resolving anaphora across modalities. Another way to
see the same problem is to look at pronouns in texts about drawings as deictic. In this second
view, the context of interpretation of a natural language term is defined as a set of expressions of
a graphical language with well-defined syntax and semantics. Natural language and graphical
terms are thought of as standing in a relation of translation similar to the translation relation that
holds between natural languages. In this paper a theory based on this second view is presented. In
this theory, the relations between multimodal representation and spatial deixis, on the one hand,
and multimodal reasoning and deictic inference, on the other, are discussed. An integrated model
of anaphoric and deictic resolution in the context of the interpretation of multimodal discourse is
also advanced.

In this paper a model for the resolution of multimodal references is presented. This
is the problem of finding the referent of a symbol in one modality using information
present either in the same or in other modalities. A model of this kind can be useful
both for implementing intelligent multimodal tools (e.g., authoring tools to input nat-
ural language and graphics interactively for the automatic construction of tutorials or
manuals) and from the point of view of human-computer interaction (HCI) where it
can help in the design of computer interfaces in which the interpretation constraints
of multimodal messages should be taken into account.
Consider Figure 1 (adapted from Rist [1996]) in which a message is expressed
through two different modalities, namely text and graphics. The figure illustrates a
kind of reasoning required to understand multimodal presentations: in order to make
sense of the message, the interpreter must realize what individuals are referred to by
the pronouns he and it in the text. For the sake of argument, it is assumed that the
graphical symbols in the figure are understood directly in terms of a graphical lexicon,
in the same way that the words he, it, and washed are understood in terms of the textual

lexicon. It can easily be seen that given the graphical context, he should resolve to the
man, and it should resolve to the car. However, this inference is not valid since the
information inferred is not contained in the overt graphical context and the meaning
of the words involved.
One way to look at this problem is as a case of anaphoric inference. Consider
that the information provided by graphical means can also be expressed through the
following piece of discourse: There is a man, a car, and a bucket. He washed it. With Kamp&apos;s
discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp 1981; Kamp and Reyle 1993) a discourse
representation structure (DRS) in which the reference to the pronoun he is constrained
to be the man can be built. However, the pronoun it has two possible antecedents,
and conceptual knowledge is required to select the appropriate one. In particular,
the knowledge that a man can wash objects with water, and that water is carried in
buckets, must be employed. If these concepts are included in the interpretation context
like DRT conditions (which should be retrieved from memory rather than from the
normal flow of discourse), the anaphora can be solved. By analogy, situations like the
one illustrated in Figure 1 have been considered problems of anaphors with pictorial
antecedents in which the interpretation context is built not from a preceding text but
from a graphical representation that is introduced with the text (André and Rist 1994).
Consider now the converse situation shown in Figure 2 (adapted from Rist [19961),
in which a drawing is interpreted as a map in the context of the preceding text. The
dots and lines in the drawing, and their properties, do not have an interpretation
and the picture in itself is meaningless. However, given the context introduced by the
text, and also considering the common knowledge that Paris is a city in France, and
Frankfurt a city in Germany, and that Germany lies to the east of France (to the right),

it is possible to infer that the denotations of the dots to the left, middle, and right
in the picture are Paris, Saarbriicken, and Frankfurt, respectively, and that the dotted
lines denote borders between countries, and in particular, the lower segment denotes
the border between France and Germany. In this example, graphical symbols can be
thought of as &amp;quot;variables&amp;quot; of the graphical representation or &amp;quot;graphical pronouns&amp;quot; that
can be resolved in terms of the textual antecedent. Here again, the inference is not
valid, as the graphical symbols could be given other interpretations or none at all.
The situation in Figure 2 has been characterized as an instance of a pictorial
anaphor with linguistic antecedent, and further related examples can be found in
André and Rist (1994). This situation, however, cannot be modeled very easily in
terms of Kamp&apos;s DRT because the &amp;quot;pronouns&amp;quot; are not linguistic objects, and lacking
a proper formalization of the graphical information, there is no straightforward way
to express in a discourse representation structure that a dot representing &amp;quot;a variable&amp;quot;
in the graphical domain has the same denotation as a natural language name or de-
scription introduced from text in a DRS. Furthermore, the situation in Figure 1 can be
thought of as anaphoric only if we ignore the modality of the graphics, as was done
above; but if the notion of modality is to be considered at all in the analysis, then
the situation in Figure 1 poses the same kinds of problems as the one in Figure 2. In
general, graphical objects, functioning as constant terms or as variables, introduced as
antecedents or as pronouns, cannot be expressed in a DRS, since the rules constructing
these structures are triggered by specific syntactic configurations of the natural lan-
guage in which the information is expressed. However, this limitation can be overcome
if graphical information can be expressed in a language with well-defined syntax and
semantics.
An alternative is to look at these kinds of problems in terms of the traditional
linguistic notion of deixis (Lyons 1968). Deixis has to do with the orientational fea-
tures of language, which are relative to the spatio-temporal situation of an utterance.
Under this view, and in connection with the notion of graphical anaphora discussed
above, it is possible to mention the deictic category of demonstrative pronouns: words
like this and that permit us to make reference to extralinguistic objects. In Figure 1,
for instance, the pronouns he and it can be supported by overt pointing acts at the
time the expression he washed it is uttered. Note that the purpose of the pointing act
is to provide the referents for the pronouns directly, greatly simplifying the resolu-
tion process. However, the deictic use of a pronoun does not necessarily have to be
supported by a physical gesture, because deictic use is characterized, more generally,
by the identification of the referent in a metalinguistic context. Ambiguity in such
words is not unusual, as they can also function as anaphors if they are preceded by
a linguistic context, and even as determiners with a deictic component (e.g., this car).
Additionally, not only demonstratives and pronouns but also proper names, definite
descriptions, and even indefinites can be used deictically. As a great variety of con-
textual factors are conceivably involved in the interpretation of a deictic expression,
gestures, although prominent, should be thought of only as one particular kind of
contextual factor. In summary, the denotation of a deictic term is the individual that
is picked out by the human interpreter in relation to the interpretation context.1 Con-
sider that in the same way that an anaphoric inference is required for identifying the
antecedent of an anaphoric term, an inference process is required for interpreting a
term used deictically. We refer to this process as a deictic inference. The inference by

which one determines that he and it are the man and the car is, accordingly, a deictic
inference.
For our purposes, it is important to investigate the nature of the relation between
the notions of deixis and modality on the one hand, and multimodal reasoning and
inference, either deictic or anaphoric, on the other. According to Kamp (1981, 283), the
difference between deictic and anaphoric pronouns is that,
deictic and anaphoric pronouns select their referents from certain sets
of antecedently available entities. The two pronoun&apos;s uses differ with
regard to the nature of these sets. In the case of a deictic pronoun
the set contains entities that belong to the real world, whereas the
selection set for an anaphoric pronoun is made up of constituents of
the representation that has been constructed in response to antecedent
discourse.
Our concern here is how &amp;quot;the set of entities that belong to the real world&amp;quot; is ac-
cessible to the interpreter. In normal deictic spatial situations the referent of a deictic
term is perceived directly through the visual modality, and as a result of such a vi-
sual interpretation process, the object is represented by the subject. The question is
how the information can be expressed in this intermediate &amp;quot;visual&amp;quot; representation. A
plausible answer is that there is a coding system and a medium associated with each
particular modality. Our suggestion is that the notion of modality is a representational
notion, and not a sensory one as normally assumed in psychological discussion. In
our sense, a modality is a formal language, with a lexicon and well-defined syntac-
tic and semantic structures, with an associated medium in which the expressions of
the modality are written. Multimodal reasoning is a process involving information
expressed in the languages associated with different modalities, and is achieved with
the help of a translation relation similar to the relation of translation between natural
languages. Performing a multimodal reasoning process is possible if the translation
relation between expressions of different modalities is available. However, for particu-
lar multimodal reasoning tasks, the translation relation between individual constants
of different modalities cannot be stated beforehand and has to be worked out dy-
namically through a deictic inferential process, as will be argued in the rest of this
paper.

This view of multimodal representation and reasoning can be formalized in terms of
Montague&apos;s general semiotic program (Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1985). Each modality
in the system can be captured through a particular language, and relations between
expressions of different modalities can be modeled in terms of translation functions
from basic and composite expressions of the source modality into expressions of the
target modality. In a system of this kind, interpreting examples in Figures 1 and 2
in relation to the linguistic modality is a matter of interpreting the information ex-
pressed through natural language directly when enough information is available, and
completing the interpretation process by means of translating expressions of the graph-
ical modality into the linguistic one, and vice versa. Consider Figure 3—developing
from previous work (Pineda 1989, 1998; Klein and Pineda 1990; Santana 1999)—in
which a multimodal representational system for linguistic and graphical modalities is
illustrated.
The circles labeled L and G in Figure 3 stand for sets of expressions of the natural
language (e.g., English) and the graphical language, respectively, and the circle labeled

Multimodal representational system for linguistic and graphical modalities.
P stands for the set of graphical symbols constituting the graphical modality proper
(i.e., the actual symbols on a piece of paper or on the screen). Note that two sets of
expressions are considered for the graphical modality: the expressions in G belong
to a formal language in which the geometry of pictures is represented and reasoned
about, and P contains the overt graphical symbols that can be seen and drawn but
cannot be manipulated directly. The functions PL-G and PGL stand for the translation
mappings between the languages L and G, and the functions pp_G and pc_p stand
for the corresponding translations between G and P. The translation function pp--G
maps well-defined objects of the graphical modality into expressions of G where the
interpretation process is performed. The translation PG-P, on the other hand, maps
geometrical expressions of G into pictures; for every well-defined term of G of a
graphical type (e.g., dot, line, etc.) there is a graphical object or a graphical composi-
tion that can be drawn or highlighted with the application of geometrical algorithms
associated to operators of G in a systematic fashion. The circle labeled W stands for
the world and together with the functions FL and Fp constitutes a multimodal system
of interpretation. The ordered pair (W, FL) defines the model ML for the natural lan-
guage, and the ordered pair (W, Fp) defines the model Mp for the interpretation of
drawings. The interpretation of expressions in G in relation to the world is defined
either by the composition FL°pG_L or, alternatively, by FP°Pc--r. The denotation of the
word France in L, for instance, is the same as the denotation of the corresponding
region of the map of Europe that denotes France, the country, since both refer to the
same individual. The denotation of the symbol r1 in G that is related to the word
France in L through PG_L, and to a particular region in P through fiG_p, is also France,
as translation is a meaning-preserving relation between expressions. The interpreta-
tion functions FL and Fp relate basic expressions, either graphical or linguistic, to the
objects or relations of the world that these expressions happen to represent, and the
definition of a semantic algebra for computing the denotation of composite graphical
and linguistic expressions is required.
An important consideration for the scheme in Figure 3 is that the symbols of P
have two roles: on the one hand, they are representational objects (e.g., a region of

the drawing represents a country), but on the other, they are also geometrical ob-
jects that can be talked about as geometrical entities. The geometrical region of the
map representing France, for instance, is itself represented by the constant r1 in G. In
this second view, geometrical entities are individual objects in the world of geometry,
and as such they have a number of geometrical properties that are independent of
whether we think of graphical symbols as objects in themselves or as symbols rep-
resenting something else. The same duality can be stated from the point of view of
the expressions of G, since the set of individual geometrical objects (i.e., P) constitutes
a domain of interpretation for the language G. This is to say that expressions of G
have two interpretations: they represent geometrical objects, properties, and relations
directly, but they also represent the objects of the world (e.g., France, Germany, etc.)
indirectly through the translation relation and interpretation of symbols in P taken as
a language (i.e., the composition Fp°pG_p). The ordered pair (P, FG) defines the model
MG for the geometrical interpretation of G as geometrical objects; the geometrical in-
terpretation function FG assigns a denotation for every constant of G; the denotation
of individual constants of G are the graphical symbols themselves, and the denotation
of operators and function symbols of G denoting graphical properties and relations
will be given by predefined geometrical algorithms commonly used in computational
geometry and computer graphics—see, for instance, Shamos (1978). The semantic in-
terpretation of composite expressions of G, on the other hand, is defined through a
semantic algebra, as will be shown below in Section 2.3.2. The definition of this ge-
ometrical interpreter will allow us to perform inferences about the geometry of the
drawing in a very effective fashion. Consider that to state explicitly all true and false
geometrical statements about a drawing would be a very cumbersome task, as the
number of statements that would have to be made even for small drawings would
be very large. Note also that although a map can be an incomplete representation
of the world (e.g., some cities might have been omitted), the geometrical algorithms
associated with operators of G will always provide complete information on the map
as a geometrical object.

1.2 Multimodal interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866">
For the kind of problem exemplified in Figures 1 and 2, the objects in L, P, and G
are given, and the function FL establishes the relation between linguistic constants
and the objects of the world that such constants happen to refer to. To interpret these
multimodal messages, Fp must be made explicit. If one asks who is he? looking at
Figure 1, for instance, the answer is found by computing PG_p(pL_G(he)), whose value
is the picture of the man on the drawing. Once this computation is performed, the
picture can be highlighted or signaled by other graphical means. However, in other
kinds of situations the knowledge of Fp might be available and the purpose of the
interpretation process could be to identify FL. If one points out the middle dot in
Figure 2 at the time the question what is this? is asked, the answer can be found
by applying the function PG_L&apos;pr-G to the dot indicated (i.e., pG_L(pp_G(.))), whose
value would be the word Saarbrikken. A similar situation arises in the interpretation of
multimodal referring expressions. Consider the following example—also from André
and Rist (1994)—in which a multimodal message is constituted by a picture of an
espresso machine that has two switches, and by the textual expression the temperature
control. In this scenario, the denotation of the natural language expression can be
found by the human interpreter if the corresponding switch is identified in the picture
through visual inspection (e.g., if the switch is highlighted). In general, multimodal
coreference can be established if PL-G and PG-I., are defined, as Fp can be made explicit
in terms of FL and vice versa.

In situations in which all theoretical elements illustrated in Figure 3 are given,
questions about multimodal scenarios can be answered through the evaluation of ex-
pressions of a given modality in terms of the interpreters of the languages involved
and the translation functions. However, when one is instructed to interpret a multi-
modal message, like Figures 1 and 2, not all information in the scheme of Figure 3 is
available. In particular, the translation functions PL-G and PG-L of the graphical and
linguistic individual constants mentioned in the texts and the pictures of the multi-
modal messages are not known, and the crucial inference of the interpretation process
has as its goal to find out the definition of these functions (i.e., to establish the rela-
tions between names of L and G). It is important to emphasize that in order to find
out PL-G and PG_L, the information overtly provided in the multimodal message is
usually not enough, and in order to carry out such an interpretation process it will be
necessary to consider the grammatical structure of the languages involved, the defi-
nition of translations rules between languages, and also conceptual knowledge stored
in memory about the interpretation domain.
An additional consideration regarding the scheme in Figure 3 is related to the
problem of ambiguity in the interpretation of multimodal messages. In the literature
of intelligent multimodal systems, ambiguity is commonly seen from the perspective of
human users. A multimodal referring expression constituted by the text the temperature
control and a drawing with two switches is said to be ambiguous, for instance, if the
human user is not able to tell which one is the temperature control. A well-designed
presentation should avoid this kind of ambiguity by providing additional information
either in a textual form (e.g., the temperature control is the switch on the left) or
by a graphical focusing technique (e.g., highlighting the left switch). An important
motivation in the design of intelligent presentation systems like WIP (Wahlster et al.
1993) and COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993) is to generate graphical and linguistic
explanations in which these kinds of ambiguities are avoided.&apos; Note, however, that
such situations are better characterized as problems of underspecification, rather than
as problems of ambiguity, since the expression the temperature control has only one
syntactic structure and one meaning, and the referent can be identified in a given
context if enough information is available.
Ambiguity in multimodal systems has also been related to the granularity of
graphical pointing acts. A map, for instance, can be represented by an expression
of G that translates into a graphical composition in P denoting a single individual
(e.g., Europe) or by a number of expressions of G that refer to the minimal graphical
partitions in P (e.g., the countries of Europe) depending on whether the focus of the
interpretation process is the whole of the drawing or its constituent parts. This prob-
lem has also been addressed in a number of intelligent multimodal systems like XTRA
(Wahlster 1991) and AlFresco (Stock et al. 1993), but the lack of a formalized notion
of graphical language (and also a better understanding of indexical expressions), has
prevented a deeper analysis of this kind of ambiguity.
These notions of &amp;quot;ambiguity&amp;quot; in multimodal systems contrast with the traditional
notion of ambiguity in natural language in which an ambiguous expression has sev-
eral interpretations. The formalization of graphical representations through the def-
inition of graphical languages with well-defined syntax and semantics allows us to
face the problem of ambiguity directly in terms of the relation of translation between
natural and graphical languages, and the semantics of expressions of both modal-

input by human users through the interaction and, therefore, there is no ambiguity to be resolved.

ities. An interesting question is whether the graphical context offers clues that the
parser can use to resolve lexical and structural ambiguity. Although we have yet to
explore this issue, there are some antecedents in this regard. In Steedman&apos;s theory
of incremental interpretation in dialogue, for instance, the rules of syntax, seman-
tics, and processing are very closely linked (Steedman 1986) and local ambiguities
may be resolved by taking into account their appropriateness to the context, which
can be graphical. Structural ambiguity in G can be appreciated, for instance, in rela-
tion to the granularity of graphical objects, as the same drawing will have different
syntactic analysis depending on whether it is interpreted as a whole or as an aggre-
gation of parts. It is likely that the resolution of this latter kind of ambiguity is also
influenced by pragmatic factors concerning the purpose of the task, the interpreta-
tion domain, and the attentional state of the interpreter, but this investigation is also
pending.
We do, however, address issues of ambiguity related to the resolution of spa-
tial indexical terms and anaphoric references in an integrated fashion. In Section
3, an incremental constraint satisfaction algorithm for resolving referential terms in
relation to the graphical domain is presented. This algorithm relies on spatial con-
straints of drawings and general knowledge about the interpretation domain, and
its computation is performed during the construction of multimodal discourse rep-
resentation structures (MDRSs), which are extensions of DRSs in DRT (Kamp and
Reyle 1993) as illustrated in Section 4. In the same way that DRT makes no pro-
vision for ambiguity resolution and alternative DRSs are constructed for different
readings of a sentence, several MDRSs would have to be constructed in our ap-
proach for ambiguous multimodal messages.&apos; However, as natural language terms
in L in our simplified domain refer to graphical objects, indefinites are very un-
likely to have specific readings (e.g, &amp;quot;a city&amp;quot; normally refers to any city) and a sim-
ple heuristic in which indefinites are within the scope of definite descriptions and
proper names can be used to obtain the preferred reading of sentences such as the
one in Figures 2. Nevertheless, even if only this reading is considered, and the in-
terpreter knows that the drawing is a map and is aware of the interpretation con-
ventions of this kind of graphical representations (i.e., countries are represented by
regions, cities by dots, etc.), drawings can still be ambiguous. In Figure 2, for instance,
there are four possible interpretations for the graphical symbols that are consistent
with the text if no knowledge of the geography of Europe is assumed. Our algo-
rithm is designed to resolve reference for spatial referential and anaphoric terms in
the course of the multimodal discourse interpretation, and the graphical ambiguity
is resolved in the course of this process, as will be shown in detail in Sections 3
and 4.
To conclude this section, we believe the formalization of the syntax and seman-
tics of graphical representations in a form compatible with the syntax and semantics
of natural language, as in the scheme in Figure 3, may be a point of departure for
investigating how the graphical or visual context helps to resolve natural language
ambiguities at different levels of representation and processing.

3 A question for further research is whether our approach can be generalized to address problems of
ambiguity by means of underspecified representations (e.g., van Deemter and Peters 1995). These
representations result from the lexical and syntactic disambiguation process, but leave unspecified some
information, like the interpretation of indexical references, the resolution of anaphoric expressions and
the semantic scope of operators. A relevant antecedent related to our extension of multimodal DRSs is
Poesio&apos;s extension of DRT into the so-called Conversational Representation Theory (Poesio 1994).

An important motivation for the study of the interpretation of multimodal mes-
sages is the definition of multimodal presentation or explanation systems in which
users are able to identify the referent of graphical and linguistic expressions eas-
ily. In WIP, for instance, a central concern is whether the human user is able to
&amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; the relevant &amp;quot;representations&amp;quot; (presumably in his or her mind) and re-
solve the graphical and linguistic ambiguities and anaphors (using WIP&apos;s terminol-
ogy) present in multimodal messages. This is possible, in general, if the message
conveys to the human user explicit interpretation paths from the information that
is available overtly to the information that the user is expected to infer. The pro-
duction of multimodal referring expressions in this kind of system depends on the
use of presentation strategies defined in terms of rhetorical structures and intentional
goals—e.g., along the lines of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thomp-
son 1988), and its computational implementation (Moore 1995). The use of a partic-
ular presentation strategy in a multimodal explanation (e.g., in WIP) depends cru-
cially on whether the expressions generated on the basis of such a strategy satisfy
the conditions defined to activate the expected representations in the user&apos;s mind
(an intentional goal). Furthermore, some rhetorical structures are designed explic-
itly to provide additional information to activate the expected representations if the
conditions for the identification of the referent of an expression are not met. Con-
sider again the resolution of the &amp;quot;ambiguity&amp;quot; in the interpretation of the tempera-
ture control example in WIP in which the presentation strategy provides the infor-
mation required by the human user to identify the referent, either through the text
the temperature control is the switch on the left or highlighting or pointing to the corre-
sponding switch in the drawing. WIP is able to tell whether the presentation would
be ambiguous for the human user if additional information were not provided be-
cause it has a representation of the actual situation and a simple model of the user&apos;s
beliefs.
Although the main representation structure of multimodal presentation and expla-
nation systems is defined at a rhetorical level, the use of presentation strategies relies
on algorithms for the generation of graphical and linguistic referring expressions. For
instance, the &amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; presentation strategy of WIP (André and Rist 1994), the pur-
pose of which is to establish a mutual belief between the human user and the system
about the identity of an object, employs an algorithm for the generation of referring
expressions based on an incremental interpretation algorithm proposed by Reiter and
Dale (1992). It is interesting to note that presentations generated by WIP and other
multimodal explanation systems like COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993), or TEX-
PLAN (Maybury 1993), are limited to the production of definite descriptions only,
even though the use of indefinite descriptions can be natural in multimodal commu-
nication. However, this restriction can be overcome with a more solid representational
framework such as the one illustrated in Figure 3. Consider that basic or composite
expressions of the languages G and L can be translated to basic or composite expres-
sions of the other language, depending on the definition of the translation function.
So, to refer linguistically to a graphical configuration, for instance, it would only be
necessary to find an expression of G that succinctly expresses the relevant graphical
properties of the desired object, and then translate it to its corresponding expression
in L. The resulting natural language expression could be used directly or embedded
in a larger natural language expression containing words that refer to abstract objects
or properties. The descriptions obtained through this strategy explicitly employ the
concrete and graphical properties of the representation, since expressions of G are

made up of constants and operators that directly describe the geometry of objects and
configurations.
Consider the natural language text: Saarbriicken lies at the intersection between the bor-
der between France and Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt. This sentence contains
the definite description the intersection between the border between France and Germany
and a line from Paris to Frankfurt, which in turn contains the border between France and
Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt. Finding the graphical referents of these ex-
pressions requires the identification of a dot, a curve, and a line on the map (i.e., the
corresponding graphical objects). These graphical objects can be referred to directly
through language; however, there are additional graphical entities on the map in Fig-
ure 2 that have an interpretation but are not mentioned explicitly in the text of the
multimodal message. In Figure 4, for instance, Belgium is represented by the region
r4, and the curve c6 represents the border between France and Belgium. Once a picture
has been interpreted, one would be entitled to ask not only for graphical objects that
have been mentioned in the textual part of the message, but also for any meaningful
graphical object. So, if one points to the curve c6 in Figure 2 at the time the question
What is this? is asked, the answer could be the border between France and Belgium, or
alternatively, the indefinite a border. As some graphical objects named by constants of
the graphical language do not have a proper name in natural language, the translation
function pc_L must associate a basic constant of G with a composite expression of L.
The process of inducing such a translation function is closely related to the process of
generating the corresponding natural language descriptions, and this relation will be
explored further in Section 3.
In the rest of this paper, we discuss in more detail how the scheme for multi-
modal representation and interpretation in Figure 3 can be carried out. In Section 2,
we present a formalization of the languages L, P. and G with their corresponding
translation functions, along the lines of Montague&apos;s general semiotic program. The
process of multimodal interpretation is explained, and the translation of expressions
of one modality into expressions of another modality is illustrated. However, such
a process can be carried out only if the translation functions are known, which is
not normally the case in the interpretation of multimodal messages (as noted above).
In Section 3, we offer an account of how such functions can be induced in terms
of the message, constraints on the interpretation conventions of the modalities, and
constraints on general knowledge of the domain. In this section we also illustrate
the process of generating graphical and linguistic descriptions, which is associated
with the induction of the translation functions. In Section 4, we discuss how to ex-

2. A Multimodal System of Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991965">
In this section, we present the definition of the syntax and semantics of languages L,
P. and G, illustrating the theory with the multimodal message of Figure 2. Language L
is a segment of English designed to produce expressions useful for referring to objects,
properties, and relations commonly found in discourse about maps. In particular, the
natural language expression of Figure 2 can be constructed in a compositional fashion.
The syntactic structure of P. on the other hand, imposes a restriction on the possible
geometries of the family of drawings in the interpretation domain. Language G is a
logical language in which interpretation and reasoning about geometrical configura-
tions can be carried out. It is an interlingua representation for information expressed
in both of the modalities.
The definitions of L, P. and G closely follow the general guidelines of Montague&apos;s
semiotic program. As a first step in the syntactic definition of a language, the set of
categories or types is stated. A number of constants—or basic expressions—for each
type is defined, and the combination rules for producing composite expressions are
stated. For each type of a source language, a corresponding type in the target lan-
guage is assigned. Basic expressions of the source language can be mapped either to
basic or to composite expressions of the corresponding type in the target language and
vice versa. For each syntactic rule of a source language, a translation rule for map-
ping the expression formed by the rule into its translation in the target language is
defined.

Language L contains the textual part of multimodal messages in the domain of maps.
An expression of L is, for instance, Saarbriicken lies at the intersection between the border
between France and Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt, which is the natural language
part of Figure 2. Constants like France and Germany, and all subexpressions of the
former sentence, like the border between France and Germany or a line from Paris to Frankfurt
are also in L. In addition, L contains expressions like France is a country, Frankfurt is
a city of Germany or Germany is to the east of France, which express general knowledge
required in the interpretation of maps.

Constants of language L.
The table in Figure 5 illustrates the constants of L with their category names and
category definitions. Common nouns are divided into CN and CN&apos;. Expressions of
category CN translate into graphical predicates (sets of graphical objects) while ex-
pressions of category CN&apos; translate into abstract concepts. For instance, city translates
into a set of dots representing cities, but east translates into a geometrical function
from regions to zones (e.g., if the region representing France is the argument of this
function, the zone to the right of that region is the function value). Prepositional
phrases are divided into PP and PP&apos; due to the classification of common nouns into
CN and CN&apos;. There are no basic constants of categories PP, PP&apos;, and IV, as prepo-
sitional words are introduced syncategorematically and intransitive verb phrases are
always composite expressions in this grammar. Transitive verbs are defined in a stan-
dard fashion, and the constant be of category IV /ADJ is used to form attributive
sentences.
Next, the syntactic rules of L are presented. Each rule is shown in a separate item
containing the purpose of the rule, the syntactic rule itself, and some examples of
expressions that can be formed with the rule. Following Montague, syntactic rules
and syntactic operations for combining symbols (for instance, FLi) associated to each
rule are separated. In the following, Pc is the set of expressions of category C.

fashion as follows: The interpretation domain is the world W = {Paris, Saarbriicken,
Frankfurt, France, Germany, the border between France and Germany, ...}. Let D, be
the set of possible denotations for expressions of type x, and for any types A and B,
DA/B =DADB (i.e., the set of all functions from DB to DA). Let FL be an interpretation
function that assigns to each constant of type A a member of DA. For the example in
Figure 3, FL is defined as shown in Figure 6.
Not every constant of L has an interpretation assigned by FL; in particular, words
like east, be, lie at, and be to have no interpretation defined directly in L. In principle
the definition of these constants could be stated as an object of the appropriate se-
mantic type but this is not a straightforward enterprise. Consider, for instance, that
the constant east of category CN&apos; is a basic object (a kind of predicate), but the indi-
vidual objects in its extension are not overtly defined in the interpretation domain.
Furthermore, it is more natural to talk about the interpretation of composite pred-
icates, like east of France, of which east is a part. However, even the interpretation
of such composite predicates is problematic, as they have a vague spatial mean-
ing. For these reasons, the interpretation of these constants is not defined explic-
itly as a part of the function FL, but in terms of their translation into G, where a
spatial meaning can be formally defined, as will be shown below. A similar strat-
egy is used for the interpretation of spatial prepositions; although of, between, and
from-to were introduced syncategorematically in the syntax of L, they could have
been defined as objects of an appropriate category and their semantics could have
been given explicitly through FL or, alternatively, through their translation into in-
tensional logic along the lines of PTQ. However, the semantic type of such objects is
extraordinarily complex, and the actual definition of these constants is seldom seen
in the literature.6 In our system the interpretation of spatial prepositions will also be
given in terms of the translation into G and the interpretation of P. Note also that
no interpretation has been defined for the determiners a and the. One strategy for
assigning a denotation would be to translate these constants into intensional logic,
but this would be required only for a larger fragment of English in which reference

6 In PTQ, prepositions—of category (IV/IV)/T)—are treated semantically as functions that apply to sets
of properties to give functions from properties to properties, but no explicit example of the actual
semantic value of any of these constants is provided. In our system it will be possible to compute the
semantic value of spatial prepositional phrases in an effective manner, yet the approach is fully
compatible with intensional logic.

to space was not the focus of study. In our approach the determiners will be in-
terpreted in terms of their translations into G in which high-order functions can be
expressed.
In summary, the semantics of some constants and all composite expressions of L
will be given in terms of their translations into G and P. Note that according to the
scheme in Figure 3, if the translations between L and G, and G and P are defined, and
the semantic interpretation of P is overtly defined, the interpretation of the natural lan-
guage expressions can be found. Although the semantics of L is not further discussed
in this paper, we consider that the interpretation of linguistic expressions referring
to spatial situations could be embedded in a larger fragment of English, and a full
semantic interpretation would have to be given by translating English into intensional
logic. In such a model the semantic value of spatial prepositions would be left unde-
fined, expressions referring to spatial configurations would be translated into G, and
the interpretation of expressions of G would be embedded within the interpretation
of intensional logic.
2.2 Definition of Language P
In this section, the syntax and semantics of language P are formally defined. The
purpose of these definitions is to characterize the family of drawings that can be in-
terpreted as maps, and to discriminate these drawings from other kinds of graphical
configurations constituted by dots, curves, and regions. This notion of a multimodal
system of representation in which objects in the graphical modality are formalized
through a well-defined language is similar to the notion of graphical language intro-
duced by Mackinlay for the automatic design of graphical presentations (Mackinlay
1987), where a number of graphical languages (e.g., the languages of bar charts, area
and position graphs, scatter plots, etc.) are formally specified. In Mackinlay&apos;s work,
expressions of graphical languages are related to the objects of the world that they
represent through an encodes relation with three arguments: the graphical constant
or expression performing the representation, the object of the world that is repre-
sented through the graphical expression, and the graphical language to which the
graphical expression belongs.&apos; The formalization of P permits us to define a pre-
cise statement of expressiveness of a graphical language, as follows: &amp;quot;a set of facts
is expressible in a language (graphical) if the language contains a sentence that en-
codes every fact in the set and does not encode any additional facts&amp;quot; (Mackinlay 1987,
54). The formalization additionally allows empirical studies to determine how effec-
tively a human user can interpret expressions of a particular graphical language in
relation to another in which the same set of facts is encoded. Although all graph-
ical languages studied by Mackinlay are conventional and have a precise geomet-
7 Incidentally, a similar encoding relation encodes is used in the WIP system to relate the representational
object to the object that it represents, but the third argument of this relation in WIP is a context space
that allows use of the same presentation in different perspectives (e.g., an espresso machine may refer
to an individual machine in a context space, or alternatively it can be seen as the prototype of espresso
machines in a different context space). The encodes relation in WIP and in Mackinlay is similar to the
translation relation between objects of P (or G) and L in our system, and we can think of a graphical
language as a language encoding the information that is intended to be communicated. However, it is
interesting to note that the status of the &amp;quot;linguistic&amp;quot; argument of the encodes relation is different in WIP
and in Mackinlay&apos;s system. In the former, it is an &amp;quot;internal representation&amp;quot;—a psychological
notion—while in the latter it stands for an object or a relation in the world itself—a semantic notion. In
our approach, on the other hand, there are no &amp;quot;internal representations&amp;quot; and the translation relates
graphical and linguistic expressions that are both &amp;quot;external&amp;quot; and that both refer to the world through a
well-defined semantics.

rical characterization, the notions of expressiveness and effectiveness of graphical
languages can be applied to more unruly graphical domains (e.g., maps are ana-
logical representations with a diagrammatic conventional component) as long as a
formalization for the family of drawings can be approximated. Here, the question
of whether arbitrary families of graphical objects can be formalized through a well-
defined syntax is left open, and although it is possible to think of many families
of drawings with very arbitrary geometries, some important efforts have been made
in the characterization of design and other kinds of objects—see, for instance, shape
grammars (Stiny 1975). Another related issue that is relevant for the construction of
multimodal interactive systems is whether it is possible and useful to input expres-
sions of P directly, and to obtain their syntactic structure through graphical parsing
techniques (Wittenburg 1998). In summary, the purpose of formalizing P is to be able
to talk about maps as a modality, where a modality, in our sense, is a code sys-
tem for the symbols expressed in a medium, and a multimodal system of represen-
tation relates information expressed through different code systems in a systematic
fashion.
2.2.1 Syntactic Definition of P. The types of P are dot, line, curve, region, zone, compos-
ite_region, dot_set, line_set, and map. Let C, be the set of constants of type s, and Es the
set of well-formed expressions of graphical type s. Although the constants of P are
the actual graphical marks on the screen or a piece of paper, a number of labels for
facilitating the presentation are illustrated in Figure 7.
For the syntactic definition of P we capitalize on the distinction introduced by
Montague between syntactic rules and syntactic operations. This distinction is based
on the observation that &amp;quot;syntactic rules can be thought of as comprising two parts:
one which specifies under what conditions the rule is to be applied, and the other
which specifies what operation to perform under those conditions&amp;quot; (Dowty, Wall, and
Peters 1985, 254). While a syntactic rule comprises both parts and defines the syntactic
structure of an expression, the syntactic operation is a rule that depends on—or at
least takes into account—the shape of the symbols and the medium in which the
symbols are substantially realized. For instance, the syntactic operation FL5 in the rule
S71_, (i.e., FL5 (a, )3) = between a and 13) combines the symbols between and and with
the arguments to form the linear string indicated by the operation. For the definition
of syntactic operations of P we generalize the operations that manipulate strings of
symbols into general geometrical operations on the shapes of the graphical symbols
on the paper or the screen, and these manipulations are defined according to certain
geometrical conditions.

With the help of this grammar it is possible to draw maps like the one illustrated
in Figure 2. Note that the basic object in this particular graphical construction is the
region. The idea is to successfully construct a map from its constituting regions (i.e.,
as in a jigsaw puzzle) until the full map is produced. Once the map is constructed,
other kinds of objects with conventional meanings, like dots and lines, can be drawn
upon the assembly of regions. Consider Figure 8 in which the syntactic structure of
the map in Figure 4 is shown. Note that the decision to use regions as basic objects in
the graphical composition is not mandatory, and alternative constructions are possible;
for instance, we could have designated curves as basic objects and obtained regions as
compositions made out of curves. The set of graphical symbols included in a graphical
syntactic tree of a map will be called the base. For instance, the base of the map
in Figure 8 is the set {di, d2, d3, /1, r2, r3, rd. The base is just the set of graphical
objects that are taken as the atoms of the graphical composition in each particular
interpretation task, and different graphical grammars would select different types of
graphical objects for the base.
The purpose of this grammar is illustrative; we make no claims about what con-
stitutes a map. P imposes very few constraints on graphical expressions, and many
configurations that can be produced with these rules might not count as maps; in ad-
dition, P is not expressive enough to characterize a large number of objects that would
be normally interpreted as maps. Another consideration is that graphical objects can
be used either as basic building blocks of the construction, or as objects produced by
graphical compositions (which we call emergent objects); for instance, in the grammar
of P. regions are basic objects but curves are produced by graphical compositions. Ad-
ditionally, in some contexts the interpretation of the graphical expression as a whole

may be required but in others only the interpretation of some of the parts may be rel-
evant; for instance, although curves are not a part of the syntactic tree in Figure 8 they
can be generated and translated into G when required through rules S3p and T3p-c
as long as the composition is made out of regions included in the base of the map.
Had the grammar allowed the generation of composite regions out of regions of the
base, these emergent objects could also be used for the generation of curves. Another
consideration is that expressions of type map are in general ambiguous as they have
several syntactic analyses, but since this feature is harmless for the current discussion
we do not pursue the issue further. A final remark is that alternative grammars could
be defined for characterizing the same class of drawings with different consequences
in the syntax and the semantics. One possibilitity, for instance, is to define a syntactic
operation that takes two adjacent regions and produces the union of the regions as one
single emerging region, instead of the set of the two regions as currently defined. Such
a rule would be similar to the rule that combines two regions to produce a curve, and
it would be useful in applications like XTRA (Wahlster 1991), in which the ambiguity
of pointing to a part or the whole is intended to be resolved.

G is a very expressive language and not every well-formed expression has a trans-
lation into L as will be further discussed in Section 2.5. Useful translations are, for
instance, names and descriptions of geometrical objects and configurations. Next, the
definition of expressions of G that have a translation into L is presented. For clarity,
the abbreviations in Figure 11 are used.
Two geometrical interpretations are given for the spatial prepositions of and be-
tween. Although the characterization of the meaning of these words is a very complex
problem that is beyond the scope of this paper, we allow that spatial prepositions can
be interpreted in more than one way, as long as each interpretation is stated in terms
of a geometrical algorithm explicitly defined in G. For instance, the spatial meaning
of of is different in city of France and east of France. In the former, of denotes a spatial
inclusion relation (oFa), but in the latter it denotes a relation of adjacency (oFb). Sim-
ilarly, the spatial meaning of between in border between France and Germany and its first
occurrence in intersection between the border between France and Germany and a line from
Paris to Frankfurt is different, as it denotes a curve in the first case (BETWEENO and a
dot in the second (BETwEENb).

2.3.2 Semantic Definition of G. The interpretation of expressions of G is defined
in relation not to the world W but to a domain constituted by the graphical objects
in P. For this reason, we refer to the interpreter of G as a geometrical interpreter,
and to the process of interpreting expressions of G as a geometrical interpretation
process. The semantics of G is given in a model-theoretic fashion as follows: Let
Pbase = {d1, d2, d3, r1, r2, r3, r4, be the set of basic graphical objects shown in Figure 4.
Let P be the union of Pbase and all graphical objects that can be produced from Pbase
with the help of geometrical functions: the emergent objects. Emergent objects can also
be produced on the basis of other emergent objects previously generated. A particular

kind of emergent object that is interesting for the current discussion is the zone of
a map that is considered to be the east of a region. For the production of emergent
objects in P there is a well-defined computational geometry algorithm associated with
an operator symbol of G, as will be seen below.
Let D, be the set of possible denotations for expressions of type x, such that De = P.
Dt = {1, 0}, and, for any types a and b, D(a,b) = D. Let FG be an interpretation function
that assigns to each constant of type a a member of D. For every graphical object co in
Pbase there is a constant a of type e such that FG (a) = (p; for our example, FG assigns the
objects d1, d2, d3, r1, r2, r3, r4, and l to the constants d1, d2, d3, r1, r2, r3, r4, and /1, respec-
tively. The interpretation (assigned by FG) of the geometrical-type predicates dot, re-
gion, curve, line, intersection are the sets containing the corresponding graphical objects.
The constants right., lie_at*, bein_zone,„ inside*, curve_between*, intersection_between*,
and line_from_to. are interpreted as geometrical functions. If the arguments of these
geometrical functions are of an appropriate type, expressions containing these con-
stants can be properly interpreted through geometrical algorithms; otherwise, these
expressions have no denotation in G and, as a consequence, their translations into L
also lack denotation. For further discussion of the interpretation of graphical expres-
sions that have no proper graphical referent in the interpretation state, see Pineda
(1992).
Following Montague, the interpretation of variables is defined in terms of an as-
signment function g. We adopt the notational convention by which the semantic value
or denotation of an expression a with respect to a model M and a value assignment
g is expressed as [[a]]Mg.
The semantic rules for interpreting expressions of G are the following:

<listItem confidence="0.998690416666667">
1. If a E Cs, then [[a]]m = FG (a).
2. If it E V„ then ([1-1]ms

In order to capture the translation of expressions of L into G compositionally,
while preserving the quantificational properties of the original source natural lan-
guage expression, terms in G referring to graphical objects are type-raised; conse-
quently, graphical predicates like be_in_zone, curve_between, and inside have type-raised
arguments. The expression curve _between (AP[P (r1)])(AP [P (r2)1)(x), for instance, refers
to the curve x between regions 7&apos;1 and r2; the first two arguments refer not to the
regions themselves, but to the set of properties that such regions have. Similarly, the
expression inside(AP]y[region(y) A P(y)])(z) denotes that the dot z is inside a region
y, but the first argument denotes the set of properties P that the region has, rather

than denoting y directly. However, whenever the full interpretation of these expres-
sions in relation to a finite domain of graphical objects is required, they must be
transformed into equivalent first-order expressions. This transformation is achieved
through meaning postulates. The result of these transformations for the examples
above are curve_between*(ri, r2) =- x and ]y[region(y)Ainside,, (z, y)] , where curve_between*
and inside denote geometrical functions whose arguments are graphical entities. The
meaning postulates are defined as follows:

<equation confidence="0.94615525">
MP1. VxVP[6(P)(x) P(Ay[S. (x, y)]) where SE {lie_at,be_in_zone, inside}

<bodyText confidence="0.9998885">
where P, P, and P2 are variables ranging over sets of properties (i.e., of type ((e, t), t)),
and x, y, u, and v are variables ranging over individuals. Meaning postulate MP1
establishes, for instance, that a geometrical relation that holds between a set of prop-
erties of an individual a and an individual b stands in one-to-one correspondence
with the relation that holds between the individuals a and b themselves, since the
only property of a that is relevant for the geometrical interpretation process is the
property of being in such a geometrical relation with the object b (i.e., that the object a
lies at, is in a zone of, or is inside the object b). Similarly for meaning postulates MP2
and MP3.
The five examples that follow illustrate how the graphical interpreter works.

an algorithm that computes the average area of all regions in the map and returns the
set of all regions whose area is larger than the average. This is a simple convention
for illustrative purposes and alternative conventions could be chosen. Although the
purpose of this paper is not to explore issues related to the interpretation of vague
terms, it is interesting to note that within the present framework specific algorithms
related to specific application domains that take into account the graphical context
could be defined for the construction of practical applications.

as this predicate is not used for picking out the object referred to by the definite
description.&apos; We call the object referred to by the denoting concept its concrete exten-
sion. The concrete extension of (10) can be identified, for instance, by interpreting the
denoting concept without using the predicative abstraction Q (i.e., ]y[VxRcurve(x) A
curve _between* (1&apos;1, r2) = x) x -= y]]) in relation to the graphical domain; if the denot-
ing concept is indefinite, we take any object satisfying the expression as its concrete
extension.
11 As argued by Kaplan, contextual factors have to be considered for the identification of the referent of a
definite description used referentially rather than attributively (Kaplan 1978). If the referent is identified
deictically, as in the current example, the referent is found through the translation of the definite
description into the graphical language, where the shape of the object is available directly. Note as well
that as expressions of G have an interpretation not only in relation to the graphical domain but also in
relation to the world, through the translation into P and the semantics of P, the referent of a definite
description in L can be found by computing the geometrical interpretation of its translation into G.

chosen. Similar conventions could be used to interpret whether other kinds of graphical objects stand
in a right-of relation. Furthermore, several conventions for the interpretation of such words can be
used and a particular geometric algorithm can be defined for each interpretation. These algorithms
need not be fully quantitative; more qualitative approaches can be employed as long as the
computation returns a semantic value of an appropriate kind.

2.4 Translations between L and G
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998681">
In this section, the translation functions PL-G and PG-L are defined. As discussed
in Section 1, the goal in interpreting a multimodal message like the one in Figure 2
is to find the translations of individual constants, which are not known. In this sec-
tion, however, we assume that the translation is fully defined in order to illustrate
all theoretical elements of the scheme in Figure 3. The induction of the translation of
individual constants, on the other hand, will be shown in Section 3.
For each syntactic category of L there is a corresponding type in G. The correspon-
dence between linguistic categories and geometrical types resembles the translation
from English to intensional logic (Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1985) and is defined in
terms of the function f as follows:

2.4.1 Translation from L into G. Figure 12 shows the translation of constants of L.
Simple terms, such as the names of cities and countries, translate into expressions
denoting characteristic functions of sets of graphical entities. This graphical type is
interpreted as the set of &amp;quot;properties&amp;quot; that an individual named by the term has (for
the purpose of this discussion a property is just the set of individuals, as no inten-
sional types are considered). So, as a city is represented by a dot in the graphical
domain, the translation of Paris, for instance, is the set of geometrical properties that
the dot representing Paris has in the interpretation state. Common nouns of category
CN and CN&apos; translate into predicates and functions from sets of properties to individ-
uals, respectively. Adjectives occurring in attributive sentences are translated as sets
of individuals. Note that there are two constants be: one combines with a term and

the other with an adjective and both combinations produce intransitive verbs. The
translations corresponding to these constants are functions from sets of properties to
sets of individuals, and from sets of individuals to sets of individuals, respectively.
Transitive verbs like lie_at and be_to translate into geometrical operators whose type is
a function from sets of properties to sets of individuals. Determiners are translated in
a standard fashion.
The translation rules for composite expressions are as follows:

Note that the term the east can be formed by the rule S4L, but it cannot be translated
into G because there is a type restriction in the definition of &apos;1L-G (i.e., 0 E PCN, but
east E Pop). This restriction prevents the translation of terms like the east as these
expressions have no concrete graphical representation; however, the east of France can
be generated, translated into G and interpreted through the geometry as shown in
Section 2.3.2. In general, natural language expressions denoting abstract concepts do
not have a graphical representation (i.e., the population of France), and although in this
grammar we have focused on expressions that can be translated into G, the language
can be extended with linguistic terms that would be interpreted only in the linguistic
modality.

As mentioned above, G is a very expressive language; not all expressions of G
can be translated into expressions of L. Rules T1G_L to T8G_L define the expressions
that do have a translation. Instances of expressions that cannot be translated are indi-
vidual constants (e.g., d1), equality relations between individuals (e.g., d1 = d2), and
conjunctions or disjunctions (e.g., dot(di) A dot(d2)). Other examples are expressions of
the form AP[P(ei)V P(e2) V. • VP(e)1, where ei is an individual constant, which denote
the set of properties that one or another individual has. However, this latter kind of

An example of the translation of a map from P into G by rule Tllp_G is shown
in Figure 16. A map is interpreted in G as the set of properties that one or an-
other graphical object in the base of the map has. Computing and translating all
possible syntactic structures that can be generated in P on the basis of the overt
graphical symbols of the drawing is not required for the interpretation of the pic-
ture in Figure 4. The translation rules permit mapping a large number of syntactic
structures into G, and they can be used as necessary. However, for the interpreta-
tion of a map we will only translate a designated expression of type map that
results from parsing a full drawing in terms of the graphical objects in the base. C

modality P. In addition, the graphical terms in the disjunction of the body of expres-
sions of type map are used in G to define the interpretation domain P
- base. When
this set is defined the semantic rules to interpret expressions of G can be evalu-
ated.
2.5.2 Translation from G into P. As mentioned in Section 1 in relation to the scheme
in Figure 3, the purpose of this translation is to draw the graphical symbols that are
referred to in G. To picture the full map, the only symbols that must be drawn are the
symbols of the base (-Phase), as emerging symbols do not have an independent pictorial
realization. Thus, the only translations that have to be defined are the translations of
the symbols contained in the expression (i.e., the map). We also have to consider
that graphical terms occurring in expressions of G can have a graphical realization,
which may be required for specific purposes. For instance, if one needs to highlight
the region to the east of France the term of G denoting that region should be translated
and depicted in P. In the definition of the rules below, Q stands for either the quantifier
A or THE.

This completes the specification of the system of multimodal representation in
Figure 3. In this system, it is possible to express natural language and graphical infor-
mation about maps and translate expressions between these two modalities. Natural
language can be seen as stating or imposing an interpretation upon graphical rep-
resentations, making the graphics meaningful. Alternatively, graphics can be seen as
representing knowledge in an effective fashion. Expressions of the languages L and
P can be translated through the interface language G in which both the semantics of
L and the geometrical structure of P can be represented and reasoned about in an
integrated fashion.
The system provides solid semantic ground on which to state and resolve prob-
lems of reference in multimodal scenarios. The syntactic and semantic structures of
the three languages permit expression and interpretation of information in each of the
modalities, and the ability to systematically find correlated expressions in different
modalities with the same semantic values. As a consequence, it is possible to state
formally what it means to resolve a multimodal reference: according to this theory, to
resolve a multimodal reference is to find the semantic value of an expression using ei-
ther the information expressed in the modality or information expressed through other
modalities with the help of the translation functions. In a fully interpreted multimodal
system such as the one illustrated in this section, interpreting a multimodal message
is a matter of evaluating the multimodal expression. However, as argued in Section 1,
the relationship between individual constants input through different modalities must
be established before multimodal expressions can be evaluated. How to establish this
relationship, the crucial part of the interpretation process, is illustrated in Section 3.

In the theory developed in Section 2, it was assumed that the translations of constants
of all categories from L into G and vice versa were available, and then multimodal
interpretation could be carried out; however, in the interpretation of multimodal mes-
sages, natural language and graphics are input from different sources, and working
out the meaning of a multimodal message is by no means trivial. As discussed in
Section 1, resolving the references and inducing the translation between graphical and
linguistic terms can be thought of as the same problem. Consider, for instance, reading
a book with words and pictures: when the associations between textual and graphical

symbols are realized by the reader, the message as a whole has been properly un-
derstood. However, it cannot be expected that such an association can be known in
advance.
The process of inducing the translation functions for constants of G and L is
similar to the computer vision problem of interpreting drawings. A related antecedent
is the work on the logic of depiction (Reiter and Mackworth 1987) in which a logic for
the interpretation of maps, to be applied to computer vision and intelligent graphics,
is developed. It is argued that any adequate representation scheme for visual (and
computer graphics) knowledge must make a distinction between knowledge of the
image (the geometry) and knowledge of the scene (its linguistic interpretation), and
about the relation between symbols at these two levels of representation; following
Reiter and Mackworth (1987) we call this the depiction relation. In Reiter&apos;s system,
two sets of first-order logic representing the scene and the image are employed. They
express, respectively, the conceptual and geometrical knowledge about handdrawn
sketch maps of geographical regions. In the view adopted here, the depiction relation
corresponds to the translation function between constants of L and G as discussed
above. An interpretation in Reiter&apos;s system is defined as a model, in the logical sense,
of both sets of sentences and the depiction relation, and interpreting a drawing is
a matter of finding all possible models of such sets of sentences. The domain for
these models is determined by the set of individuals in the image and the scene
of the picture that is being interpreted. Although computing the set of models of a
set of first-order logical formulae is a very hard computational problem, the entities
constituting a drawing normally form a finite set, which is often small. So, whether it
is possible to compute the set of models of a given drawing is an empirical question.
In particular, Reiter&apos;s system employs a constraint satisfaction algorithm to find all
possible interpretations of maps, and the output of his system is a set of labels for
such as &amp;quot;river&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;road&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;shore&amp;quot; for curves or chains, and &amp;quot;land region&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;water
region&amp;quot; for areas. As mentioned above, finding the translation functions between G
and L is a similar problem, with the same level of complexity. In Section 3.1, we
present a constraint satisfaction algorithm for the induction of the translation into G
of individual constants of L mentioned explicitly in the text of a multimodal message.
We also show how composite terms of L can be translated into their corresponding
graphical expressions of G (and subsequently of P).
A second consideration in this section is that working out the translation between
graphical and linguistic individual constants suggests a method for generating natu-
ral language expressions that refer to graphical objects and configurations. Note that
inducing the linguistic translation of a graphical term that has not been mentioned
overtly in the textual part of a multimodal message is the same as generating a lin-
guistic description for the object denoted by the corresponding graphical term: once
one knows the translation between individual constants of both of the modalities, the
generation of multimodal descriptions can be achieved through the translation rules.
For instance, in the map of Figure 4, if one points to the curve c1 once the translation
of individual constants has been found, the expression the border between France and
Germany can be generated. This strategy for producing natural language descriptions
is discussed further in Section 3.2.

From the point of view of our system, in interpreting multimodal messages like Fig-

and parsing a drawing (an expression of type map) produces a syntactic structure of
P whose translation into G is the expression (which we called the map). Emergent
objects can also be represented in G as long as they can be produced from the base
through syntactic rules of P and their translations into G. Consequently, expressions of
G that refer to graphical objects stand in a one-to-one relation with the corresponding
objects in P. Although, theoretically, expressions in G and P are different represen-
tational objects, in actual interpretation processes they always come packed together.
The relation between expressions of G and L, on the other hand, has to be worked
out. For this purpose we present an algorithm for establishing a relationship between
the individual constants of L and the graphical constants included in the expression
(the map), which correspond to the interpretation domain Pbase. The algorithm for
computing the translation function assigns a graphical constant to all proper names
overtly mentioned in the linguistic part of a multimodal message (e.g., the graphi-
cal symbols d1, d2, d3, r1, and r2 to the linguistic constants Paris, Saarbri,icken, Frankfurt,
France, and Germany, respectively). The set of proper names appearing in a particular
multimodal message will be referred to as Names. As the translations for linguistic con-
stants of other types are given beforehand, once the translations for proper names are
available, it is possible to find the graphical symbols and configurations that corefer
with composite natural language descriptions through the translation rules between
L, G, and P. For instance, once the regions representing France and Germany have
been identified, the term the border between France and Germany can be translated into an
expression of G, which denotes the corresponding curve, and also into the drawing of
the curve in P. which denotes the border between France and Germany itself. Here, it
is important to highlight that the translation for individual constants cannot normally
be found with the overt information expressed through the multimodal message only.
For working out the interpretation of Figure 2, for instance, we need, in addition to
the text and graphics, knowledge about the geography of Europe and also knowledge
about the interpretation conventions of maps.
For the definition of the algorithm, a table representing the set of possible functions
from linguistics predicates (e.g., city, country, etc.) to their corresponding graphical
types (e.g, dot, region, etc.) is defined. This table will be referred to as a function table.
For each particular interpretation task, a set of appropriate function tables is defined
according to the following rule: For each 6 E CCN of L and 6&apos; E C(e,t) of G such that
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.930324666666667">
PL—G(6) = , create a function table (X6, Y6,) such that:
X6 = fx E CTI[[X is a Se is true and x E Names}
Y = {y E Ce I [{61 (y)]jm is true}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951818181818">
where X6 and Y6 are not empty. In case either of these two sets is empty no function
table for the corresponding pair is defined.
The function tables for our example are illustrated in Figure 17.
Note that if only one cell of each column of a function table is filled in, a function
from proper names to graphical constants is defined. Furthermore, if the result of this
process is a table in which only one cell of each row is also marked, the function is
one-to-one. Accordingly, if there are n names and m graphical objects, the first column
of a function table can be filled up in m different ways, the second in m — 1 different
ways, and so on, until n graphical objects have been assigned. As a consequence,
each function table with n names and m graphical objects defines m!/(m — n)! possible
translation functions.19 In the example, (Xcdy, Y dot) and (Xeountry, Yregion) define 6 and 12

possible functions, respectively. Let T6 be the set of possible translation functions for
the function table (X6, Y6,), and let F be the cross product of all T6 in an interpretation
context (i.e., the set of possible translation models). For our example, F = Tcity x T country,
where IFI = 72. This set contains 72 ordered pairs of functions, and each one represents
a possible translation model for the multimodal message. Translation models can be
enumerated by assigning a natural number to every cell in the array F. We give the
following enumeration for bidimensional translation models: let -y,„ -=- gi) be the nth
translation model in F = T x Ty, where 0(n( IFI and f, E T,g1 E T. For every n, if mod
ITI 0 then i = (n — 1 mod ITI) + 1 and j = (n — 1 div &apos;Tx&apos;) + 1. Similar expressions
can be defined for higher dimensions.
To enumerate the set of possible functions from n names to m graphical objects we
use the following procedure: Let N be a list of names and 0 a list of graphical objects,
and let F-INDEX be an n-digit string containing the n digits of a numeral in base m.
Every string in F-INDEX codifies a total function in which the jth graphical object mi
in 0 (where 0 &lt; j(m) is assigned to the nith name in N by the rule F-INDEX(i) =j. The
set of possible entries in F-INDEX codes the ne possible functions from n names to
m graphical objects. One-to-one functions are those in which no mj occurs more than
once in a given value of F-INDEX. The functions sought are the m!/(m — n)! one-to-one
functions that result from enumerating in base m all possible values for F-INDEX from
0 to inn —1, and filtering out all numbers in which the same digit occurs more than once
in the enumeration order. Consider the graphical illustration of the F-INDEX scheme
for identifying the functions corresponding to a function table with three names and
four graphical objects in Figure 18. This function table has 43 = 64 possible functions
out of which 4!/(4 — 3)! = 24 are one-to-one. The graphical object mj in 0 is associated
to the name n, in N by marking the corresponding cell in the table, where j is placed
in the corresponding cell of F-INDEX. The string in F-INDEX is the numeral 000 in
interpretation scenarios related to the Hyperproof system (Barwise and Etchemendy 1994)—the
number of possible translation functions will be mn, where m is the number of graphical objects and n
is the number of names.

three names.
Some examples of the enumeration of functions are shown, in Figure 19. The first
table shows function 12 (base 4), which is the smallest index for a one-to-one function;
the second table shows function 123, which associates names n1, n2, and n3 to the
graphical objects 01,02, and 03, respectively; the third table illustrates the function 321,
which is the largest index for a total function in the set; and finally, the fourth table
illustrates the function 333, which is a constant function assigning the object 03 to all
three names.
Armed with these concepts, we can define an algorithm for working out the in-
terpretation of a multimodal message, as follows: Let messageL be a sentence of L (the
textual part of the multimodal message), OG an empty set of expressions of G, and
F the set of possible translation models for message. Then, for each E r assume
that is a translation model for messageL and include its translation messages under
-y, in OG—i.e., pL_G(messageL) = messages. If the semantic value of all expressions OG
in relation to the geometrical domain Pba„ is true, then -y, is a translation model for
message; otherwise, exclude -y, from F. Once all translation models have been tested,
check whether there is only one -yi in F. If so, that is the translation function; other-
wise, select a new appropriate expression of L (a general knowledge constraint) and
include its translation into G in OG, and repeat the process until there is only one -yj
in F.
For our example, 4 translations out of the 72 -y&apos;s in F will come out true for the first
cycle of the algorithm in which the multimodal message is used as the only constraint
(Example 5 in Section 2.3), as shown in Figure 20.
To continue with the algorithm, some knowledge of the geography of Europe is
required. For our problem the constraints relevant to interpreting the message are
illustrated in Figure 21.
The idea of the algorithm is simply to take constraints one at a time and produce
the interpretation of the message incrementally. Considering constraint 1 in Figure 21,
the translation functions (2) and (4) in Figure 20 can be removed; the translation func-
tion (3), in turn, can be ruled out either through constraints 2 or 3 (the interpretation
of the translation of constraint 1 into G is shown in Example 4 in Section 2.3). For the
example, only three cycles of the algorithm are required to rule out all but the correct
translation model in r, which is the translation function (1) in Figure 20.
This concludes the presentation of the procedure for interpreting proper names
deictically in relation to a graphical context. Although only the interpretation of this
kind of constant was required for our example, the interpretation of other kinds of
terms, e.g. pronouns, can be carried out in the present framework. Consider that to
be able to cope with multimodal messages in which pronouns were included in the
textual part, as in Figure 1, a more general definition of the language L would be
required, but in such an extension both proper names and pronouns would be con-

stants of category T in the grammar. In the present framework, pronouns would be
interpreted along the lines of proper names. For the definition of function tables, each
pronoun present in a multimodal text would be included in the set Names, and as
a first approximation, it would be a member of the domain of all function tables;
different instances of the same pronoun would be considered two different objects
in the interpretation process (e.g., heo, ., etc.), and the interpretation would be
worked out as shown above. It is also possible to think of a situation in which there
are two or more graphical objects with the same name; in this context, proper names
would be considered kinds of pronouns, and from the point of view of L, a different
subscripted constant of category T (nameo,namei, .) would be assigned to each such
graphical object. To differentiate these objects, alternative definite descriptions could
be obtained through the translation from constants of P into expressions of G, as will
be argued in Section 3.2, and such descriptions could be used in the context of the
particular rhetorical structures and communicative purposes of multimodal messages.
A further consideration is that not only the constants of category T in a grammar can
be used deictically; definite and indefinite descriptions can also be interpreted in this
way. Consider that the textual part of the multimodal message in Figure 1 could have
been John washed it, the man washed it, or even a man washed it and all three terms John,

the man, and a man would have to be interpreted deictically in relation to the graphical
context. To be able to deal with this latter situation, descriptions can be interpreted
deictically in our approach if terms of this kind are also included in the set Names
for the construction of function tables. More generally, our interpretation procedure
defines a function from terms into individuals of the world through the graphical
context. This is because although function tables define translation models between
linguistic and graphical terms, graphical objects in P denote the corresponding indi-
viduals in the world. We can think of our deictic interpretation procedure as a specific
implementation for our graphical domain of Kaplan&apos;s operator DTHAT—in our sim-
plified extensional language—which takes a term and maps it into an individual of
the world in the interpretation context whenever the term is used deictically (Kaplan
1978).
The interpretation of proper names and definite descriptions has long been a
source of interesting semantic problems. Consider that linguistic terms serve to iden-
tify individuals, and whenever they are used, the individual they denote should exist.
However, as pointed out by Donnellan and commented on by Kaplan, &amp;quot;using a definite
description referentially a speaker may say something true even though the descrip-
tion correctly applies to nothing&amp;quot; (Kaplan 1978). For example, suppose a bachelor
enters a room accompanied by a woman who is misintroduced as his wife. Someone
who notices the woman&apos;s solicitous attention to the man, says His wife is kind to him.
The speaker uses the description his wife to refer to the woman, which implies that
the bachelor has a wife (!), and nevertheless, what the speaker says is true. Here, one
might be inclined to say that his wife applies to nothing, but if the woman is in the
visual field of the speaker, it would be more proper to say that his wife applies de-
ictically to the woman. If the expression she is kind to him had been used instead, or
simply, the speaker had pointed to the woman at the time the expression is kind to him
were uttered, the deictic nature of the reference would be easily revealed. According
to Kaplan, whenever a description is used referentially (as opposed to attributively),
describing can be taken as a form of pointing, and as he suggested, instead of taking
the sense of a description as the subject of a proposition, the sense is used only to fix
the denotation, which is then taken directly as the subject of the proposition. Similarly,
although a proper name is usually thought of as related to an individual (the bearer)
in an intimate fashion through an interpretation function in model theory, and it is of-
ten stated that proper names are related to the same individual through all world and
time indices (i.e., as rigid designators [Kripke 1972]), we would argue proper names
can be also interpreted deictically to fix a referent, which can then be taken directly
as the subject of a proposition.

The multimodal representation scheme and the resolution of deictic inferences pre-
sented above permit the generation of multimodal descriptions in a simple and sys-
tematic fashion. Once a multimodal representational system is fully defined, the gen-
eration of graphical and linguistic expressions can be achieved directly through the
translation rules. As the crucial piece of knowledge required for use of the translation
rules is the translation model, the deictic inference required to identify an individual
and the inference required to generate a description for such an individual are but
two sides of the same coin.
If a graphical object is pointed out on the screen, a number of natural language
descriptions to refer to it can be produced. Several strategies for finding an appropri-
ate description are available, depending on whether the object pointed at is in P

or whether it is an emergent object. Another consideration is whether the object has

a proper name or can be referred to either by a definite or an indefinite description.
Suppose that a graphical cursor for pointing to graphical objects is available. The cur-
sor itself is modeled as a graphical object of type dot within the graphical domain.
With this interactive device we can identify dots if the position of a dot in a drawing
is the same as the position of the cursor, lines and curves if the cursor lies on the line
or the curve, and regions if the cursor is inside or on the border of a region. With
this device, we can select all basic or emergent graphical objects that are identified by
an individual pointing act. Basic objects will be identified directly, and the emergent
objects selected by a pointing act will be those that can be produced by the grammar
of P and satisfy the geometrical conditions associated with the cursor. Objects iden-
tified by a cursor will be terms of P that can be translated into G as proper names,
definite descriptions, or indefinite descriptions. To refer to a graphical object we can
use the following simple strategy: if a graphical object can be translated into L as a
proper name, use the proper name; if the graphical object can be translated as a de-
scription and it is the only one satisfying such a description, use a definite description;
otherwise, use an indefinite description.
Consider a pointing action in which the dot ch or the region r1 is selected. The
translations from P into G of these objects, according to rule Tlp_G (a), are AP[P(c/i)]
and AP[P(ri)], respectively. As these expressions can be translated into L as shown
in Figure 14, these objects can be referred to in L as Paris and France, respectively.
However, consider that as these objects are the concrete extension of a number of
denoting concepts of G, these objects can also be translated into G through rule T1p-c
(b) as A/THE(dot), and A / THE(region), respectively, and they can be translated into L
as a/the city and a/the country. Another possible translation for the dot d1 whenever it
is produced by rule S4p and translated into G through T4p_G is A/THE(oFa(Ri)(dot)),
which in turn can be translated into L as a/the city of France.
There may be constants of P that cannot be translated into L as proper names.
Consider, for instance, the line /1 in Figure 4; the translation of this line into G is
AP[P(11)], but as can be seen in Figure 14, there is no proper name that corresponds
to this expression in L. However, this constant could be translated by rule Tlp_G (b)
as the denoting concepts A/THE(line). As the line is also an emergent object that can
be produced via the syntactic rule S2p, its translations according to rule T2p_G are
A/THE(FRom_To(Di)(133)(line)); subsequently, such an object can be referred to in L as
a/the line and a/the line from Paris to Frankfurt. A similar example is the description of
the curve c1, which is produced by rule S3p and can be translated into L through G
as a/the border between France and Germany.
As mentioned in Section 1, the generation of descriptions is required within the
context of specific rhetorical and intentional structures, such as the activate structure
of the WIP system, which employs Reiter and Dale&apos;s algorithm for the production of
definite descriptions on demand. Our system can be used to support the generation
of descriptions either definite or indefinite, and even pronouns used deictically, in
multimodal generation systems with a solid semantic base. These descriptions could
be used according to particular rhetorical and intentional structures related to specific
application domains. The advantage of such an approach is that the choice of the ex-
pressions to be used in multimodal presentations could be made not only on the basis
of predefined heuristics, but also on the basis of the semantic value of these expres-
sions in the context of use. In addition, the decision about what kind of knowledge is
expressed through either modality for the production of coordinated natural language
and graphical explanations could take into account not only the kind of heuristics that
are currently employed in systems like WIP and COMET, but also the expressiveness
and effectiveness criteria of natural and graphical languages.

<bodyText confidence="0.999919216216216">
The ability to interpret individual multimodal messages is a prerequisite for interpret-
ing sequences of multimodal messages occurring in the normal flow of interactive
conversations. In the same sense that discourse theories, like DRT, are designed to
interpret sequences of sentences, it is desirable to have a theory in which sequences
of multimodal messages can be interpreted. Such a theory would have to support
anaphoric and deictic resolution models in an integrated fashion, and would have
to be placed in a larger pragmatic setting in which intentions and presuppositions
are considered, and in which mechanisms to retrieve knowledge from memory are
also taken into account. To work out such a theory is quite an ambitious goal; how-
ever, in the same way that DRT focuses in internal structural processes that govern
anaphoric resolution, it is plausible to consider a multimodal discourse representation
theory (MDRT) to cope with the resolution of spatial deictic inferences. In the same
way that DRT postulates discourse representation structures in which referents and
conditions are introduced incrementally through the interpretation of the incoming
natural language discourse by means of the application of construction rules, it is
plausible to conceive similar multimodal discourse representation structures (MDRS)
whose referents and conditions would be introduced by modality-dependent con-
struction rules acting upon the expressions of the corresponding modality. In these
structures, DRS conditions extracted from different modalities would be kept in sep-
arate partitions, but discourse referents would be abstract objects common to the
whole MDRS. In particular, MDRS&apos;s could help to specify accessibility relations be-
tween anaphoric and deictic terms and their antecedents and interpretation context,
imposing severe constraints on the possible interpretations, as is normal in DRT.
The resolution process itself would be accomplished by incremental constraint sat-
isfaction, as shown for deictic inferences. In the rest of this section, we present a
schematic picture of how an MDRS can be developed, and illustrate using the inter-
pretation of the multimodal message in Figure 2. Consider first the empty MDRS in
Figure 22.
The MDRS is a structure with four partitions; it extends traditional DRS with
one partition for graphical conditions and another to store the translation models
that hold in a particular interpretation state. The partition for linguistic conditions
is used as in normal DRS, and the top partition for referents includes a variable
for every individual that is referred to in the multimodal message in either of the
modalities. Figure 23 illustrates the initial state for the interpretation process of the
multimodal message in Figure 2. Graphical expressions of G (the map) are included
in the graphical section of the MDRS, and textual conditions, with the associated
type information, are included in the linguistic section as in normal DRS. A refer-

ent is included in the corresponding partition for every individual that has been in-
troduced through either modality, as referents are considered medium-independent
abstractions. In the same way that the order of processing of linguistic information
is not crucial for the definition of the linguistic conditions, we abstract over scan-
ning considerations and assume that graphical expressions are introduced as a single
&amp;quot;sentence.&amp;quot;2° Finally, the partition for the possible translation models is empty at this
stage, as the coreference relation between text and graphics has not yet been estab-
lished.
The interpretation process by constraint satisfaction is illustrated in Figure 24.
Figure 24(a) illustrates the interpretation state after the first cycle of the constraint
satisfaction algorithm presented in Section 3.1 has been carried out. In this state,
the partition for the translation conditions contains the disjunction of the four pos-
sible translation models that are consistent with the message, taking the message
itself as the only interpretation constraint. Figure 24(b) illustrates the interpretation
state once the additional constraint that Germany is to the east of France has been
considered.21 The interpretation of the corresponding expression introduces two addi-
tional discourse referents (n6 and n7), as the terms Germany and France in the textual
part of the message should be resolved anaphorically in relation to the context pre-
viously built. However, this anaphoric resolution process is kept within the linguistic
section of the MDRS and should take into account the accessibility constraints between
anaphor and antecedent, as commonly done in DRT. The result of this anaphoric in-
ference is reflected in the equality conditions n6 = n3 and n7 = n2. The inclusion
of the constraint Germany is to the east of France permits us to rule out two possible
translation models, and the result of the second cycle of the constraint satisfaction
20 We leave for further research whether the analysis of scanning protocols by means of eye-tracking
techniques can provide information for imposing additional constraints on accessibility relations and
possible translation models for the construction of MDRS&apos;s. An interesting antecedent for the definition
of such constraints can be found in Faraday and Sutcliffe (1998).
21 How this constraint is selected is beyond the scope of this paper and we only make the assumption
that the symbols in the graphical and linguistic partitions of the MDRS form a part of the indexing
scheme required to retrieve the information from memory. For a prototype implementation, this kind
of constraint could be provided by the human user directly.

<abstract confidence="0.989354971428571">An important aspect of the interpretation of multimodal messages is the ability to identify when the same object in the world is the referent of symbols in different modalities. To understand the caption of a picture, for instance, one needs to identify the graphical symbols that are referred to by names and pronouns in the natural language text. One way to think of this problem is in terms of the notion of anaphora; however, unlike linguistic anaphoric inference, in which antecedents for pronouns are selected from a linguistic context, in the interpretation of the textual part of multimodal messages the antecedents are selected from a graphical context. Under this view, resolving multimodal references is like resolving anaphora across modalities. Another way to see the same problem is to look at pronouns in texts about drawings as deictic. In this second view, the context of interpretation of a natural language term is defined as a set of expressions of a graphical language with well-defined syntax and semantics. Natural language and graphical terms are thought of as standing in a relation of translation similar to the translation relation that holds between natural languages. In this paper a theory based on this second view is presented. In this theory, the relations between multimodal representation and spatial deixis, on the one hand, and multimodal reasoning and deictic inference, on the other, are discussed. An integrated model of anaphoric and deictic resolution in the context of the interpretation of multimodal discourse is also advanced. 1. Reference, Spatial Deixis, and Modality In this paper a model for the resolution of multimodal references is presented. This is the problem of finding the referent of a symbol in one modality using information present either in the same or in other modalities. A model of this kind can be useful both for implementing intelligent multimodal tools (e.g., authoring tools to input natural language and graphics interactively for the automatic construction of tutorials or manuals) and from the point of view of human-computer interaction (HCI) where it can help in the design of computer interfaces in which the interpretation constraints of multimodal messages should be taken into account. Consider Figure 1 (adapted from Rist [1996]) in which a message is expressed through two different modalities, namely text and graphics. The figure illustrates a kind of reasoning required to understand multimodal presentations: in order to make sense of the message, the interpreter must realize what individuals are referred to by pronouns the text. For the sake of argument, it is assumed that the graphical symbols in the figure are understood directly in terms of a graphical lexicon, the same way that the words it, understood in terms of the textual * Department of Computer Science, Institute for Applied Mathematics and Systems (IIMAS), National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Mexico.

It can be seen that given the graphical context, resolve to the and resolve to the car. However, this inference is not valid since the information inferred is not contained in the overt graphical context and the meaning of the words involved. One way to look at this problem is as a case of anaphoric inference. Consider that the information provided by graphical means can also be expressed through the piece of discourse: is a man, a car, and a bucket. He washed it. Kamp&apos;s representation theory 1981; Kamp and Reyle 1993) a discourse structure (DRS) in which the reference to the pronoun constrained the man can be built. However, the pronoun two possible antecedents, and conceptual knowledge is required to select the appropriate one. In particular, the knowledge that a man can wash objects with water, and that water is carried in buckets, must be employed. If these concepts are included in the interpretation context like DRT conditions (which should be retrieved from memory rather than from the normal flow of discourse), the anaphora can be solved. By analogy, situations like the one illustrated in Figure 1 have been considered problems of anaphors with pictorial antecedents in which the interpretation context is built not from a preceding text but from a graphical representation that is introduced with the text (André and Rist 1994). Consider now the converse situation shown in Figure 2 (adapted from Rist [19961), in which a drawing is interpreted as a map in the context of the preceding text. The dots and lines in the drawing, and their properties, do not have an interpretation and the picture in itself is meaningless. However, given the context introduced by the text, and also considering the common knowledge that Paris is a city in France, and Frankfurt a city in Germany, and that Germany lies to the east of France (to the right), 140 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution it is possible to infer that the denotations of the dots to the left, middle, and right in the picture are Paris, Saarbriicken, and Frankfurt, respectively, and that the dotted lines denote borders between countries, and in particular, the lower segment denotes the border between France and Germany. In this example, graphical symbols can be thought of as &amp;quot;variables&amp;quot; of the graphical representation or &amp;quot;graphical pronouns&amp;quot; that can be resolved in terms of the textual antecedent. Here again, the inference is not valid, as the graphical symbols could be given other interpretations or none at all. The situation in Figure 2 has been characterized as an instance of a pictorial anaphor with linguistic antecedent, and further related examples can be found in André and Rist (1994). This situation, however, cannot be modeled very easily in terms of Kamp&apos;s DRT because the &amp;quot;pronouns&amp;quot; are not linguistic objects, and lacking a proper formalization of the graphical information, there is no straightforward way to express in a discourse representation structure that a dot representing &amp;quot;a variable&amp;quot; in the graphical domain has the same denotation as a natural language name or description introduced from text in a DRS. Furthermore, the situation in Figure 1 can be thought of as anaphoric only if we ignore the modality of the graphics, as was done above; but if the notion of modality is to be considered at all in the analysis, then the situation in Figure 1 poses the same kinds of problems as the one in Figure 2. In general, graphical objects, functioning as constant terms or as variables, introduced as antecedents or as pronouns, cannot be expressed in a DRS, since the rules constructing these structures are triggered by specific syntactic configurations of the natural language in which the information is expressed. However, this limitation can be overcome if graphical information can be expressed in a language with well-defined syntax and semantics. An alternative is to look at these kinds of problems in terms of the traditional linguistic notion of deixis (Lyons 1968). Deixis has to do with the orientational features of language, which are relative to the spatio-temporal situation of an utterance. Under this view, and in connection with the notion of graphical anaphora discussed above, it is possible to mention the deictic category of demonstrative pronouns: words us to make reference to extralinguistic objects. In Figure 1, instance, the pronouns be supported by overt pointing acts at the the expression washed it uttered. Note that the purpose of the pointing act is to provide the referents for the pronouns directly, greatly simplifying the resolution process. However, the deictic use of a pronoun does not necessarily have to be supported by a physical gesture, because deictic use is characterized, more generally, by the identification of the referent in a metalinguistic context. Ambiguity in such words is not unusual, as they can also function as anaphors if they are preceded by linguistic context, and even as determiners with a deictic component (e.g., car). Additionally, not only demonstratives and pronouns but also proper names, definite descriptions, and even indefinites can be used deictically. As a great variety of contextual factors are conceivably involved in the interpretation of a deictic expression, gestures, although prominent, should be thought of only as one particular kind of contextual factor. In summary, the denotation of a deictic term is the individual that picked out by the human interpreter in relation to the interpretation Consider that in the same way that an anaphoric inference is required for identifying the antecedent of an anaphoric term, an inference process is required for interpreting a used deictically. We refer to this process as a inference. inference by</abstract>

For our purposes, it is important to investigate the nature of the relation between the notions of deixis and modality on the one hand, and multimodal reasoning and inference, either deictic or anaphoric, on the other. According to Kamp (1981, 283), the difference between deictic and anaphoric pronouns is that, deictic and anaphoric pronouns select their referents from certain sets of antecedently available entities. The two pronoun&apos;s uses differ with regard to the nature of these sets. In the case of a deictic pronoun the set contains entities that belong to the real world, whereas the selection set for an anaphoric pronoun is made up of constituents of the representation that has been constructed in response to antecedent discourse. Our concern here is how &amp;quot;the set of entities that belong to the real world&amp;quot; is accessible to the interpreter. In normal deictic spatial situations the referent of a deictic term is perceived directly through the visual modality, and as a result of such a visual interpretation process, the object is represented by the subject. The question is how the information can be expressed in this intermediate &amp;quot;visual&amp;quot; representation. A plausible answer is that there is a coding system and a medium associated with each particular modality. Our suggestion is that the notion of modality is a representational notion, and not a sensory one as normally assumed in psychological discussion. In our sense, a modality is a formal language, with a lexicon and well-defined syntactic and semantic structures, with an associated medium in which the expressions of the modality are written. Multimodal reasoning is a process involving information expressed in the languages associated with different modalities, and is achieved with the help of a translation relation similar to the relation of translation between natural languages. Performing a multimodal reasoning process is possible if the translation relation between expressions of different modalities is available. However, for particular multimodal reasoning tasks, the translation relation between individual constants of different modalities cannot be stated beforehand and has to be worked out dynamically through a deictic inferential process, as will be argued in the rest of this paper. 1.1 A Model for Multimodal Representation This view of multimodal representation and reasoning can be formalized in terms of Montague&apos;s general semiotic program (Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1985). Each modality in the system can be captured through a particular language, and relations between expressions of different modalities can be modeled in terms of translation functions from basic and composite expressions of the source modality into expressions of the target modality. In a system of this kind, interpreting examples in Figures 1 and 2 in relation to the linguistic modality is a matter of interpreting the information expressed through natural language directly when enough information is available, and completing the interpretation process by means of translating expressions of the graphical modality into the linguistic one, and vice versa. Consider Figure 3—developing from previous work (Pineda 1989, 1998; Klein and Pineda 1990; Santana 1999)—in which a multimodal representational system for linguistic and graphical modalities is illustrated. circles labeled Figure 3 stand for sets of expressions of the natural language (e.g., English) and the graphical language, respectively, and the circle labeled 142 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution Figure 3 Multimodal representational system for linguistic and graphical modalities. for the set of graphical symbols constituting the graphical modality proper (i.e., the actual symbols on a piece of paper or on the screen). Note that two sets of are considered for the graphical modality: the expressions in to a formal language in which the geometry of pictures is represented and reasoned and the overt graphical symbols that can be seen and drawn but be manipulated directly. The functions PL-GandPGLstand for the translation between the languages the functions the corresponding translations between translation function well-defined objects of the graphical modality into expressions of the process is performed. The translation the other hand, maps expressions of pictures; for every well-defined term of a type (e.g., line, there is a graphical object or a graphical composition that can be drawn or highlighted with the application of geometrical algorithms to operators of a systematic fashion. The circle labeled W stands for world and together with the functions and a multimodal system interpretation. The ordered pair (W, defines the model ML for the natural lanand the ordered pair Fp) the model Mp for the interpretation of The interpretation of expressions in relation to the world is defined by the composition or, alternatively, by FP°Pc--r.The denotation of the instance, is the same as the denotation of the corresponding region of the map of Europe that denotes France, the country, since both refer to the individual. The denotation of the symbol is related to the word and to a particular region in also France, as translation is a meaning-preserving relation between expressions. The interpretation functions FL and Fp relate basic expressions, either graphical or linguistic, to the objects or relations of the world that these expressions happen to represent, and the definition of a semantic algebra for computing the denotation of composite graphical and linguistic expressions is required. important consideration for the scheme in Figure 3 is that the symbols of have two roles: on the one hand, they are representational objects (e.g., a region of 143 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 the drawing represents a country), but on the other, they are also geometrical objects that can be talked about as geometrical entities. The geometrical region of the representing France, for instance, is itself represented by the constant this second view, geometrical entities are individual objects in the world of geometry, and as such they have a number of geometrical properties that are independent of whether we think of graphical symbols as objects in themselves or as symbols representing something else. The same duality can be stated from the point of view of expressions of the set of individual geometrical objects (i.e., domain of interpretation for the language is to say that expressions of have two interpretations: they represent geometrical objects, properties, and relations directly, but they also represent the objects of the world (e.g., France, Germany, etc.) through the translation relation and interpretation of symbols in as language (i.e., the composition Fp°pG_p). The ordered pair defines the model the geometrical interpretation of geometrical objects; the geometrical infunction a denotation for every constant of denotation individual constants of the graphical symbols themselves, and the denotation operators and function symbols of graphical properties and relations will be given by predefined geometrical algorithms commonly used in computational geometry and computer graphics—see, for instance, Shamos (1978). The semantic inof composite expressions of the other hand, is defined through a semantic algebra, as will be shown below in Section 2.3.2. The definition of this geometrical interpreter will allow us to perform inferences about the geometry of the drawing in a very effective fashion. Consider that to state explicitly all true and false geometrical statements about a drawing would be a very cumbersome task, as the number of statements that would have to be made even for small drawings would be very large. Note also that although a map can be an incomplete representation of the world (e.g., some cities might have been omitted), the geometrical algorithms with operators of always provide complete information on the map as a geometrical object. 1.2 Multimodal interpretation the kind of problem exemplified in Figures 1 and 2, the objects in P, are given, and the function FL establishes the relation between linguistic constants and the objects of the world that such constants happen to refer to. To interpret these messages, be made explicit. If one asks is he? at 1, for instance, the answer is found by computing value is the picture of the man on the drawing. Once this computation is performed, the picture can be highlighted or signaled by other graphical means. However, in other of situations the knowledge of be available and the purpose of the process could be to identify If one points out the middle dot in 2 at the time the question is this? asked, the answer can be found by applying the function PG_L&apos;pr-G to the dot indicated (i.e., pG_L(pp_G(.))), whose would be the word similar situation arises in the interpretation of multimodal referring expressions. Consider the following example—also from André and Rist (1994)—in which a multimodal message is constituted by a picture of an machine that has two switches, and by the textual expression temperature this scenario, the denotation of the natural language expression can be found by the human interpreter if the corresponding switch is identified in the picture through visual inspection (e.g., if the switch is highlighted). In general, multimodal can be established if PL-Gand are defined, as be made explicit terms of and vice versa. 144 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution In situations in which all theoretical elements illustrated in Figure 3 are given, questions about multimodal scenarios can be answered through the evaluation of expressions of a given modality in terms of the interpreters of the languages involved and the translation functions. However, when one is instructed to interpret a multimodal message, like Figures 1 and 2, not all information in the scheme of Figure 3 is In particular, the translation functions the graphical and linguistic individual constants mentioned in the texts and the pictures of the multimodal messages are not known, and the crucial inference of the interpretation process has as its goal to find out the definition of these functions (i.e., to establish the relabetween names of It important to emphasize that in order to find PL-Gand information overtly provided in the multimodal message is usually not enough, and in order to carry out such an interpretation process it will be necessary to consider the grammatical structure of the languages involved, the definition of translations rules between languages, and also conceptual knowledge stored in memory about the interpretation domain. An additional consideration regarding the scheme in Figure 3 is related to the problem of ambiguity in the interpretation of multimodal messages. In the literature of intelligent multimodal systems, ambiguity is commonly seen from the perspective of users. referring expression constituted by the text temperature a drawing with two switches is said to be ambiguous, for instance, if the human user is not able to tell which one is the temperature control. A well-designed presentation should avoid this kind of ambiguity by providing additional information either in a textual form (e.g., the temperature control is the switch on the left) or by a graphical focusing technique (e.g., highlighting the left switch). An important motivation in the design of intelligent presentation systems like WIP (Wahlster et al. 1993) and COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993) is to generate graphical and linguistic explanations in which these kinds of ambiguities are avoided.&apos; Note, however, that such situations are better characterized as problems of underspecification, rather than problems of ambiguity, since the expression temperature control only one syntactic structure and one meaning, and the referent can be identified in a given context if enough information is available. Ambiguity in multimodal systems has also been related to the granularity of graphical pointing acts. A map, for instance, can be represented by an expression translates into a graphical composition in a single individual Europe) or by a number of expressions of refer to the minimal graphical in the countries of Europe) depending on whether the focus of the interpretation process is the whole of the drawing or its constituent parts. This problem has also been addressed in a number of intelligent multimodal systems like XTRA (Wahlster 1991) and AlFresco (Stock et al. 1993), but the lack of a formalized notion of graphical language (and also a better understanding of indexical expressions), has prevented a deeper analysis of this kind of ambiguity. These notions of &amp;quot;ambiguity&amp;quot; in multimodal systems contrast with the traditional notion of ambiguity in natural language in which an ambiguous expression has several interpretations. The formalization of graphical representations through the definition of graphical languages with well-defined syntax and semantics allows us to face the problem of ambiguity directly in terms of the relation of translation between and graphical languages, and the semantics of expressions of both modal- 2 It is also worth noticing that systems like WIP and COMET do not interpret multimodal messages input by human users through the interaction and, therefore, there is no ambiguity to be resolved. 145 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 ities. An interesting question is whether the graphical context offers clues that the parser can use to resolve lexical and structural ambiguity. Although we have yet to explore this issue, there are some antecedents in this regard. In Steedman&apos;s theory of incremental interpretation in dialogue, for instance, the rules of syntax, semantics, and processing are very closely linked (Steedman 1986) and local ambiguities may be resolved by taking into account their appropriateness to the context, which can be graphical. Structural ambiguity in G can be appreciated, for instance, in relation to the granularity of graphical objects, as the same drawing will have different syntactic analysis depending on whether it is interpreted as a whole or as an aggregation of parts. It is likely that the resolution of this latter kind of ambiguity is also influenced by pragmatic factors concerning the purpose of the task, the interpretation domain, and the attentional state of the interpreter, but this investigation is also pending. We do, however, address issues of ambiguity related to the resolution of spatial indexical terms and anaphoric references in an integrated fashion. In Section 3, an incremental constraint satisfaction algorithm for resolving referential terms in relation to the graphical domain is presented. This algorithm relies on spatial constraints of drawings and general knowledge about the interpretation domain, and its computation is performed during the construction of multimodal discourse representation structures (MDRSs), which are extensions of DRSs in DRT (Kamp and Reyle 1993) as illustrated in Section 4. In the same way that DRT makes no provision for ambiguity resolution and alternative DRSs are constructed for different readings of a sentence, several MDRSs would have to be constructed in our approach for ambiguous multimodal messages.&apos; However, as natural language terms in L in our simplified domain refer to graphical objects, indefinites are very unlikely to have specific readings (e.g, &amp;quot;a city&amp;quot; normally refers to any city) and a simple heuristic in which indefinites are within the scope of definite descriptions and proper names can be used to obtain the preferred reading of sentences such as the one in Figures 2. Nevertheless, even if only this reading is considered, and the interpreter knows that the drawing is a map and is aware of the interpretation conventions of this kind of graphical representations (i.e., countries are represented by regions, cities by dots, etc.), drawings can still be ambiguous. In Figure 2, for instance, there are four possible interpretations for the graphical symbols that are consistent with the text if no knowledge of the geography of Europe is assumed. Our algorithm is designed to resolve reference for spatial referential and anaphoric terms in the course of the multimodal discourse interpretation, and the graphical ambiguity is resolved in the course of this process, as will be shown in detail in Sections 3 and 4. To conclude this section, we believe the formalization of the syntax and semantics of graphical representations in a form compatible with the syntax and semantics of natural language, as in the scheme in Figure 3, may be a point of departure for investigating how the graphical or visual context helps to resolve natural language ambiguities at different levels of representation and processing. 3 A question for further research is whether our approach can be generalized to address problems of ambiguity by means of underspecified representations (e.g., van Deemter and Peters 1995). These representations result from the lexical and syntactic disambiguation process, but leave unspecified some information, like the interpretation of indexical references, the resolution of anaphoric expressions and the semantic scope of operators. A relevant antecedent related to our extension of multimodal DRSs is Poesio&apos;s extension of DRT into the so-called Conversational Representation Theory (Poesio 1994). 146 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution 1.3 Multimodal Generation An important motivation for the study of the interpretation of multimodal messages is the definition of multimodal presentation or explanation systems in which users are able to identify the referent of graphical and linguistic expressions easily. In WIP, for instance, a central concern is whether the human user is able to &amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; the relevant &amp;quot;representations&amp;quot; (presumably in his or her mind) and resolve the graphical and linguistic ambiguities and anaphors (using WIP&apos;s terminology) present in multimodal messages. This is possible, in general, if the message conveys to the human user explicit interpretation paths from the information that is available overtly to the information that the user is expected to infer. The production of multimodal referring expressions in this kind of system depends on the use of presentation strategies defined in terms of rhetorical structures and intentional goals—e.g., along the lines of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1988), and its computational implementation (Moore 1995). The use of a particular presentation strategy in a multimodal explanation (e.g., in WIP) depends crucially on whether the expressions generated on the basis of such a strategy satisfy the conditions defined to activate the expected representations in the user&apos;s mind (an intentional goal). Furthermore, some rhetorical structures are designed explicitly to provide additional information to activate the expected representations if the conditions for the identification of the referent of an expression are not met. Conagain the resolution of the &amp;quot;ambiguity&amp;quot; in the interpretation of temperacontrol in WIP in which the presentation strategy provides the information required by the human user to identify the referent, either through the text temperature control is the switch on the left highlighting or pointing to the corresponding switch in the drawing. WIP is able to tell whether the presentation would be ambiguous for the human user if additional information were not provided because it has a representation of the actual situation and a simple model of the user&apos;s beliefs. Although the main representation structure of multimodal presentation and explanation systems is defined at a rhetorical level, the use of presentation strategies relies on algorithms for the generation of graphical and linguistic referring expressions. For instance, the &amp;quot;activate&amp;quot; presentation strategy of WIP (André and Rist 1994), the purpose of which is to establish a mutual belief between the human user and the system about the identity of an object, employs an algorithm for the generation of referring expressions based on an incremental interpretation algorithm proposed by Reiter and Dale (1992). It is interesting to note that presentations generated by WIP and other multimodal explanation systems like COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993), or TEX- PLAN (Maybury 1993), are limited to the production of definite descriptions only, even though the use of indefinite descriptions can be natural in multimodal communication. However, this restriction can be overcome with a more solid representational framework such as the one illustrated in Figure 3. Consider that basic or composite of the languages be translated to basic or composite expressions of the other language, depending on the definition of the translation function. So, to refer linguistically to a graphical configuration, for instance, it would only be to find an expression of succinctly expresses the relevant graphical properties of the desired object, and then translate it to its corresponding expression resulting natural language expression could be used directly embedded in a larger natural language expression containing words that refer to abstract objects or properties. The descriptions obtained through this strategy explicitly employ the and graphical properties of the representation, since expressions of 147 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 Labeling the graphical objects in Figure 2. made up of constants and operators that directly describe the geometry of objects and configurations. the natural language text: lies at the intersection between the borbetween France and Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt. sentence contains definite description intersection between the border between France and Germany a line from Paris to Frankfurt, in turn contains border between France and line from Paris to Frankfurt. the graphical referents of these expressions requires the identification of a dot, a curve, and a line on the map (i.e., the corresponding graphical objects). These graphical objects can be referred to directly through language; however, there are additional graphical entities on the map in Figure 2 that have an interpretation but are not mentioned explicitly in the text of the multimodal message. In Figure 4, for instance, Belgium is represented by the region the curve c6 represents the border between France and Belgium. Once a picture has been interpreted, one would be entitled to ask not only for graphical objects that have been mentioned in the textual part of the message, but also for any meaningful object. So, if one points to the curve Figure 2 at the time the question is this? asked, the answer could be border between France and Belgium, the indefinite border. some graphical objects named by constants of the graphical language do not have a proper name in natural language, the translation associate a basic constant of a composite expression of The process of inducing such a translation function is closely related to the process of generating the corresponding natural language descriptions, and this relation will be explored further in Section 3. In the rest of this paper, we discuss in more detail how the scheme for multimodal representation and interpretation in Figure 3 can be carried out. In Section 2, present a formalization of the languages P. their corresponding translation functions, along the lines of Montague&apos;s general semiotic program. The process of multimodal interpretation is explained, and the translation of expressions of one modality into expressions of another modality is illustrated. However, such a process can be carried out only if the translation functions are known, which is not normally the case in the interpretation of multimodal messages (as noted above). In Section 3, we offer an account of how such functions can be induced in terms of the message, constraints on the interpretation conventions of the modalities, and constraints on general knowledge of the domain. In this section we also illustrate the process of generating graphical and linguistic descriptions, which is associated the induction of the translation functions. In 4, we discuss how to ex- 148 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution tend Kamp&apos;s DRS with multimodal structures. Finally, in Section 5, some concluding remarks and some directions for further work are presented. 2. A Multimodal System of Representation this section, we present the definition of the syntax and semantics of languages the theory with the multimodal message of Figure 2. Language is a segment of English designed to produce expressions useful for referring to objects, properties, and relations commonly found in discourse about maps. In particular, the natural language expression of Figure 2 can be constructed in a compositional fashion. syntactic structure of the other hand, imposes a restriction on the possible of the family of drawings in the interpretation domain. Language a logical language in which interpretation and reasoning about geometrical configurations can be carried out. It is an interlingua representation for information expressed in both of the modalities. definitions of P. follow the general guidelines of Montague&apos;s semiotic program. As a first step in the syntactic definition of a language, the set of categories or types is stated. A number of constants—or basic expressions—for each type is defined, and the combination rules for producing composite expressions are stated. For each type of a source language, a corresponding type in the target language is assigned. Basic expressions of the source language can be mapped either to basic or to composite expressions of the corresponding type in the target language and vice versa. For each syntactic rule of a source language, a translation rule for mapping the expression formed by the rule into its translation in the target language is defined. 2.1 Definition of Language L the textual part of multimodal messages in the domain of maps. expression of for instance, lies at the intersection between the border France and Germany and a line from Paris to Frankfurt, is the natural language of Figure 2.

Syntactic Definition of L. set of syntactic categories of as follows: The basic syntactic categories of IV, ADJ, CN, category of sentences, the category of intransitive verbs, category of adjectives, and two categories of common nouns.

Common nouns are divided into of into graphical predicates (sets of graphical objects) while exof category into abstract concepts. For instance, a set of dots representing cities, but into a geometrical function from regions to zones (e.g., if the region representing France is the argument of this function, the zone to the right of that region is the function value).

Although the semantics of not further discussed in this paper, we consider that the interpretation of linguistic expressions referring to spatial situations could be embedded in a larger fragment of English, and a full semantic interpretation would have to be given by translating English into intensional logic. In such a model the semantic value of spatial prepositions would be left undeexpressions referring to spatial configurations would be translated into interpretation of expressions of be embedded within the interpretation of intensional logic. 2.2 Definition of Language P this section, the syntax and semantics of language formally defined. The purpose of these definitions is to characterize the family of drawings that can be interpreted as maps, and to discriminate these drawings from other kinds of graphical configurations constituted by dots, curves, and regions. This notion of a multimodal system of representation in which objects in the graphical modality are formalized through a well-defined language is similar to the notion of graphical language introduced by Mackinlay for the automatic design of graphical presentations (Mackinlay 1987), where a number of graphical languages (e.g., the languages of bar charts, area and position graphs, scatter plots, etc.) are formally specified. In Mackinlay&apos;s work, expressions of graphical languages are related to the objects of the world that they through an with three arguments: the graphical constant or expression performing the representation, the object of the world that is represented through the graphical expression, and the graphical language to which the expression belongs.&apos; The formalization of us to define a precise statement of expressiveness of a graphical language, as follows: &amp;quot;a set of facts is expressible in a language (graphical) if the language contains a sentence that encodes every fact in the set and does not encode any additional facts&amp;quot; (Mackinlay 1987, 54). The formalization additionally allows empirical studies to determine how effectively a human user can interpret expressions of a particular graphical language in relation to another in which the same set of facts is encoded. Although all graphlanguages studied by Mackinlay are conventional and have a precise geomet- Incidentally, a similar encoding relation used in the WIP system to relate the representational to the object that it represents, but the third argument of this relation in WIP is a space that allows use of the same presentation in different perspectives (e.g., an espresso machine may refer to an individual machine in a context space, or alternatively it can be seen as the prototype of espresso in a different context space). The in WIP and in Mackinlay is similar to the relation between objects of and in our system, and we can think of a graphical language as a language encoding the information that is intended to be communicated. However, it is to note that the status of the &amp;quot;linguistic&amp;quot; argument of the is different in WIP and in Mackinlay&apos;s system. In the former, it is an &amp;quot;internal representation&amp;quot;—a psychological notion—while in the latter it stands for an object or a relation in the world itself—a semantic notion. In our approach, on the other hand, there are no &amp;quot;internal representations&amp;quot; and the translation relates graphical and linguistic expressions that are both &amp;quot;external&amp;quot; and that both refer to the world through a well-defined semantics. 153 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 Constant Type d2, d3, • • • dot 11,12,13, • • • line c2, • • curve r2, r3, • • region Z3r • • zone . . • composite _region 0, dsi, ds2, . . . dot _set 0, lsi , 152, • • • line_set ttl3r • • map Figure 7 of language rical characterization, the notions of expressiveness and effectiveness of graphical languages can be applied to more unruly graphical domains (e.g., maps are analogical representations with a diagrammatic conventional component) as long as a formalization for the family of drawings can be approximated. Here, the question of whether arbitrary families of graphical objects can be formalized through a welldefined syntax is left open, and although it is possible to think of many families of drawings with very arbitrary geometries, some important efforts have been made in the characterization of design and other kinds of objects—see, for instance, shape grammars (Stiny 1975). Another related issue that is relevant for the construction of multimodal interactive systems is whether it is possible and useful to input expresof and to obtain their syntactic structure through graphical parsing techniques (Wittenburg 1998). In summary, the purpose of formalizing P is to be able to talk about maps as a modality, where a modality, in our sense, is a code system for the symbols expressed in a medium, and a multimodal system of representation relates information expressed through different code systems in a systematic fashion. Syntactic Definition of P. The types of line, curve, region, zone, composdot_set, line_set, C, be the set of constants of type s, and the of well-formed expressions of graphical type s. Although the constants of the actual graphical marks on the screen or a piece of paper, a number of labels for facilitating the presentation are illustrated in Figure 7. the syntactic definition of capitalize on the distinction introduced by Montague between syntactic rules and syntactic operations. This distinction is based on the observation that &amp;quot;syntactic rules can be thought of as comprising two parts: one which specifies under what conditions the rule is to be applied, and the other which specifies what operation to perform under those conditions&amp;quot; (Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1985, 254). While a syntactic rule comprises both parts and defines the syntactic structure of an expression, the syntactic operation is a rule that depends on—or at least takes into account—the shape of the symbols and the medium in which the symbols are substantially realized. For instance, the syntactic operation FL5 in the rule (i.e., )3) = a and 13) the symbols the arguments to form the linear string indicated by the operation. For the definition syntactic operations of generalize the operations that manipulate strings of symbols into general geometrical operations on the shapes of the graphical symbols on the paper or the screen, and these manipulations are defined according to certain geometrical conditions. 154 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution definition of well-formed expressions of as follows: CONSTANT If a E then a E Examples: 0, /, LINE If a, 0 E E a line from a to 0. resulting graphical expression is only the line) CURVE If a, 0 E that a and 0 are adjacent then E p2(a, is the curve between a and 0. . , resulting graphical expression is only the curve) INTERSECTION If a E 0 Fp3(a,i3) E is the dot in the intersection between a and 0.

Note that the basic object in this particular graphical construction is the region. The idea is to successfully construct a map from its constituting regions (i.e., as in a jigsaw puzzle) until the full map is produced. Once the map is constructed, other kinds of objects with conventional meanings, like dots and lines, can be drawn upon the assembly of regions. Consider Figure 8 in which the syntactic structure of the map in Figure 4 is shown. Note that the decision to use regions as basic objects in the graphical composition is not mandatory, and alternative constructions are possible; for instance, we could have designated curves as basic objects and obtained regions as compositions made out of curves. The set of graphical symbols included in a graphical tree of a map will be called the instance, the base of the map 8 the set {di, d2, d3, /1, r3, The base is just the set of graphical that are taken as the the graphical composition in each particular interpretation task, and different graphical grammars would select different types of graphical objects for the base. The purpose of this grammar is illustrative; we make no claims about what cona map. very few constraints on graphical expressions, and many configurations that can be produced with these rules might not count as maps; in adnot expressive enough to characterize a large number of objects that would be normally interpreted as maps. Another consideration is that graphical objects can be used either as basic building blocks of the construction, or as objects produced by compositions (which we call objects); instance, in the are basic objects but curves are produced by graphical compositions. Additionally, in some contexts the interpretation of the graphical expression as a whole 8 Examples for the rules S7p to Slip are included in the construction of the map in Figure 8, as explained below. 156 Figure 8 Construction of a map. may be required but in others only the interpretation of some of the parts may be relevant; for instance, although curves are not a part of the syntactic tree in Figure 8 they be generated and translated into required through rules S3p and T3p-c as long as the composition is made out of regions included in the base of the map. Had the grammar allowed the generation of composite regions out of regions of the base, these emergent objects could also be used for the generation of curves. Another is that expressions of type in general ambiguous as they have several syntactic analyses, but since this feature is harmless for the current discussion we do not pursue the issue further. A final remark is that alternative grammars could be defined for characterizing the same class of drawings with different consequences in the syntax and the semantics. One possibilitity, for instance, is to define a syntactic operation that takes two adjacent regions and produces the union of the regions as one single emerging region, instead of the set of the two regions as currently defined. Such a rule would be similar to the rule that combines two regions to produce a curve, and it would be useful in applications like XTRA (Wahlster 1991), in which the ambiguity of pointing to a part or the whole is intended to be resolved.

The syntactic rules of G are as follows: If If p, If 0 then If and If 0 then If and then G is a very expressive language and not every well-formed expression has a translation into L as will be further discussed in Section 2.5.

Emergent objects can also be produced on the basis of other emergent objects previously generated. A particular 162 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution kind of emergent object that is interesting for the current discussion is the zone of a map that is considered to be the east of a region. For the production of emergent in is a well-defined computational geometry algorithm associated with operator symbol of will be seen below. the set of possible denotations for expressions of type that = P. = 0}, and, for any types = D.

If the arguments of these geometrical functions are of an appropriate type, expressions containing these constants can be properly interpreted through geometrical algorithms; otherwise, these have no denotation in as a consequence, their translations into also lack denotation. For further discussion of the interpretation of graphical expressions that have no proper graphical referent in the interpretation state, see Pineda (1992). Following Montague, the interpretation of variables is defined in terms of an asfunction adopt the notational convention by which the semantic value denotation of an expression respect to a model M and a value assignment expressed as semantic rules for interpreting expressions of the following: If = FG (a). If If 13 If and that function that for all objects equal to like g except that (u) = k. If i then 1 iff for some value assignment that exactly like possibly for the individual assigned = If and then 1 iff for every value assignment that exactly like possibly for the individual to = 1. order to capture the translation of expressions of while preserving the quantificational properties of the original source natural lanexpression, terms in to graphical objects are type-raised; consegraphical predicates like curve_between, type-raised The expression _between (AP[P (r1)])(AP [P (r2)1)(x), instance, refers the curve regions 7&apos;1 first two arguments refer not to the regions themselves, but to the set of properties that such regions have. Similarly, the that the dot z is inside a region the first argument denotes the set of properties the region has, rather 163 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 than denoting y directly. However, whenever the full interpretation of these expressions in relation to a finite domain of graphical objects is required, they must be transformed into equivalent first-order expressions. This transformation is achieved postulates. result of these transformations for the examples are r2) =x (z, y)] , geometrical functions whose arguments are graphical entities. The meaning postulates are defined as follows: VxVP[6(P)(x) P(Ay[S. y)]) {lie_at,be_in_zone, inside} VxVP[6(P)(x) Ay = E {right} VxVP1VP2[6(Pi)(P2)(x) = E intersection_between, line_from_to} P, variables ranging over sets of properties (i.e., of type t), t)), v are variables ranging over individuals. Meaning postulate MP1 establishes, for instance, that a geometrical relation that holds between a set of propof an individual an individual in one-to-one correspondence the relation that holds between the individuals since the property of is relevant for the geometrical interpretation process is the of being in such a geometrical relation with the object that the object at, is in a zone of, or is inside the object for meaning postulates MP2 and MP3. The five examples that follow illustrate how the graphical interpreter works. Example 1 the interpretation of the expression is the translaof country is big. expression can be reduced as follows: APAQ3x[P(x) (region) (AP AzP(z)) (big) APAQ3x[P(x) (region) AQ]x[region(x) ]x[region(x) ]x[region(x) Expression (5) is interpreted through the standard quantification rules of the geometinterpreter without the help of meaning postulates. The interpretation of an algorithm that computes the average area of all regions in the map and returns the set of all regions whose area is larger than the average. This is a simple convention for illustrative purposes and alternative conventions could be chosen. Although the purpose of this paper is not to explore issues related to the interpretation of vague terms, it is interesting to note that within the present framework specific algorithms related to specific application domains that take into account the graphical context could be defined for the construction of practical applications. Example 2 the interpretation of (Ri) (R2) the transof border between France and Germany, will be shown in Section 2.4.1. The 164 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution expression without the abbreviations is: APAQ]y[Vx[P(x) 4—&gt; Ax( Ay( Az Au, [z _between (x)(y)(u)] (AP[P(r1)11(AP[P(r2)])(curve)) which can be reduced as follows: AP AQ]y[Vx[P(x) 4—&gt; x = y] _between(AP[P (ri)])(AP[P (r2)])(u)]) AQ]y[Vx[Au[curve(u) _between(AP[P (r1)11 4—* Yi AQ3y[Vx[(curve(x) A curve _between(AP[P (r1)1)(AP[P (r2)])(x)) x = y] AQ]y[VxRcurve(x) A curve _between(AP[P (r1)])(AP[P (r2)])(x)) 4-4 x = y] AQ]y[VxRcurve(x) (v, u) = x Yi AQ]y[V xRcurve(x) A AP[P(r2)](Au[Av[curve_between„(v, u) = x] = y] AQ(Y)] AQ]y[VxRcurve(x) (r2)](Au[curve _between.(ri,u) = x])) 4-4 x = y] AQ(Y)] AQ]y[Vx[(curve(x) (11, u) = x](r2)) x QM] AQ]y[Vx[(curve(x) _between r2) = x) x = y] Note that Expression (5) cannot be further reduced unless the types of the arof the predicate _between lowered with the help of meaning postulate MP3. The geometrical functions in Expression (10) can be evaluated directly. Expression (10) is a denoting concept that refers to the curve between the regions cannot be further reduced. Consider that the expression border France and Germany a definite description and, in order to obtain a truth value, must be combined with a predicate. The graphical object referred to by (10), on the other hand, could be identified regardless of the nature of the predicate Q, as this predicate is not used for picking out the object referred to by the definite We call the object referred to by the denoting concept its extenconcrete extension of (10) can be identified, for instance, by interpreting the concept without using the predicative abstraction Q (i.e., _between* (1&apos;1, r2) = x) x -= y]]) relation to the graphical domain; if the ing concept is indefinite, we take any object satisfying the expression as its concrete extension. 11 As argued by Kaplan, contextual factors have to be considered for the identification of the referent of a definite description used referentially rather than attributively (Kaplan 1978). If the referent is identified deictically, as in the current example, the referent is found through the translation of the definite description into the graphical language, where the shape of the object is available directly. Note as well as expressions of an interpretation not only in relation to the graphical domain but also in to the world, through the translation into the semantics of referent of a definite in be found by computing the geometrical interpretation of its translation into 165 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 Example 3 Consider the interpretation of an expression similar to the one in Example 2, but which an indefinite is included.

Expression (9) is a denoting concept similar to the final expression in Example 2, but one which has an embedded quantified expression. Meaning postules MP1 to MP3 are defined in such a way that terms preserve quantificational properties through the reduction process. Example 4 Consider the expression R2(bein_zone(THE(oFb(Ri)(right))))—which is the translation of is to the east of France. reduced expression is the following: be_in_zone(AQ]y[Vx[right(AP[P(ri)])(x) x = y] by meaning postulate MP2: be_in_zone(AQ3yrdx[AP[P(r1)](Az[right.(z) = xl) x Q(y)])(r2) be_in_zone(AQ3yrdx[Az[right.(z) = x](ri) x 4. be_in_zone(AQAyNx[right.(n) = x x = y A Q(Y)i)(r2) 166 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution by meaning postulate MPl: AQ]yrdx[right.(ri) = x x = y] Ay[Vx[right(ri) = x x = y] z)](Y)] ay[Vx[right.(n) = x — x -= y] A be_in_zone„.

It is worth emphasizing that as the five examples illustrate, the reason for typeraising graphical terms is to be able to translate natural language quantified expression into the graphical domain compositionally in a rather elegant way. The scheme provides a clear specification strategy; however, in a practical implementation, it would 12 This is an arbitrary convention defined for illustrative purposes and alternative conventions could be chosen. Similar conventions could be used to interpret whether other kinds of graphical objects stand in a right-of relation. Furthermore, several conventions for the interpretation of such words can be used and a particular geometric algorithm can be defined for each interpretation. These algorithms need not be fully quantitative; more qualitative approaches can be employed as long as the computation returns a semantic value of an appropriate kind. 167 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 constant of L: a Category name Category definition Translation into G: pi...-c(a) Corresponding type in G Paris T t/IV AP[P(di)] Frankfurt T t/IV AP[P(d3)] ((e, t), t) Saarbriicken T t/IV AP[F(d2)] ((e, t), t) France T t/IV AP[P(ri)] ((e, t), t) Germany T t/IV AP[P(r2)] city CN CN dot (e, t) country CN CN region (e, t) border CN CN curve (e, t) line CN CN line (e, t) intersection CN CN intersection (e, t) east CN&apos; CN&apos; right (((e, t), t), e) big AD] ADJ big (e, t) be TV IV / (t/ IV) AP AxP(Ay[x = y]) (((e, t), t), (e, t)) be IV / ADJ IV / ADJ AP AxP(x) ((e, t), (e, t)) lie at TV IV / (t / IV) lie _at (((e, t), t), (e, t)) be to TV IV / (t / IV) be _in_zone (((e, t), t), (e, t)) a T / CN (t / IV)/ CN AQ3x[P(x) the T /CN (t / IV)/ CN ((e, t), ((e, t), t)) Figure 12 Translation of constants of L into G. convenient to limit the expressive power of to define it as a first-order language. 2.4 Translations between L and G this section, the translation functions defined. As discussed in Section 1, the goal in interpreting a multimodal message like the one in Figure 2 is to find the translations of individual constants, which are not known. In this section, however, we assume that the translation is fully defined in order to illustrate all theoretical elements of the scheme in Figure 3. The induction of the translation of individual constants, on the other hand, will be shown in Section 3. each syntactic category of is a corresponding type in correspondence between linguistic categories and geometrical types resembles the translation from English to intensional logic (Dowty, Wall, and Peters 1985) and is defined in of the function follows: 1. f (t) = t. f (CN) = f (IV) = f (ADJ) = , t) . For any categories f (A / B) = (f(B),f (A)). Translation from L into G. 12 shows the translation of constants of Simple terms, such as the names of cities and countries, translate into expressions denoting characteristic functions of sets of graphical entities. This graphical type is interpreted as the set of &amp;quot;properties&amp;quot; that an individual named by the term has (for the purpose of this discussion a property is just the set of individuals, as no intensional types are considered). So, as a city is represented by a dot in the graphical the translation of instance, is the set of geometrical properties that the dot representing Paris has in the interpretation state. Common nouns of category into predicates and functions from sets of properties to individuals, respectively. Adjectives occurring in attributive sentences are translated as sets individuals. Note that there are two constants combines with a term and 168 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution the other with an adjective and both combinations produce intransitive verbs.

A map is interpreted in G as the set of properties that one or another graphical object in the base of the map has. Computing and translating all possible syntactic structures that can be generated in P on the basis of the overt graphical symbols of the drawing is not required for the interpretation of the picture in Figure 4. The translation rules permit mapping a large number of syntactic structures into G, and they can be used as necessary. However, for the interpretaof a map we will only translate a designated expression of type results from parsing a full drawing in terms of the graphical objects in the base.

Translation from G into P. mentioned in Section 1 in relation to the scheme in Figure 3, the purpose of this translation is to draw the graphical symbols that are to in picture the full map, the only symbols that must be drawn are the of the base (-Phase),as emerging symbols do not have an independent pictorial realization. Thus, the only translations that have to be defined are the translations of the symbols contained in the expression (i.e., the map). We also have to consider graphical terms occurring in expressions of have a graphical realization, which may be required for specific purposes. For instance, if one needs to highlight region to the east of France the term of that region should be translated depicted in the definition of the rules below, Q stands for either the quantifier (a) If a -= then pG_p(a) is the drawing of If = Q(s) line, curve, region, zone} is drawing of whatever graphical object in • PG-p(AP[P(4)]) / PG-p(AP[P(ri)1) = pG_p(A(region)) = LINE T2G_p. a,,@ that are either Or a&apos; pG-r (0) = /3&apos; then P1 0&apos;).

This completes the specification of the system of multimodal representation in Figure 3. In this system, it is possible to express natural language and graphical information about maps and translate expressions between these two modalities. Natural language can be seen as stating or imposing an interpretation upon graphical representations, making the graphics meaningful. Alternatively, graphics can be seen as knowledge in an effective fashion. Expressions of the languages be translated through the interface language which both the semantics of the geometrical structure of be represented and reasoned about in an integrated fashion. The system provides solid semantic ground on which to state and resolve problems of reference in multimodal scenarios. The syntactic and semantic structures of the three languages permit expression and interpretation of information in each of the modalities, and the ability to systematically find correlated expressions in different modalities with the same semantic values. As a consequence, it is possible to state formally what it means to resolve a multimodal reference: according to this theory, to resolve a multimodal reference is to find the semantic value of an expression using either the information expressed in the modality or information expressed through other modalities with the help of the translation functions. In a fully interpreted multimodal system such as the one illustrated in this section, interpreting a multimodal message is a matter of evaluating the multimodal expression. However, as argued in Section 1, the relationship between individual constants input through different modalities must be established before multimodal expressions can be evaluated. How to establish this relationship, the crucial part of the interpretation process, is illustrated in Section 3. 3. Resolution of Deictic Inference by Constraint Satisfaction In the theory developed in Section 2, it was assumed that the translations of constants all categories from vice versa were available, and then multimodal interpretation could be carried out; however, in the interpretation of multimodal messages, natural language and graphics are input from different sources, and working out the meaning of a multimodal message is by no means trivial. As discussed in Section 1, resolving the references and inducing the translation between graphical and linguistic terms can be thought of as the same problem. Consider, for instance, reading a book with words and pictures: when the associations between textual and graphical 179 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 symbols are realized by the reader, the message as a whole has been properly understood. However, it cannot be expected that such an association can be known in advance. The process of inducing the translation functions for constants of G and L is similar to the computer vision problem of interpreting drawings. A related antecedent is the work on the logic of depiction (Reiter and Mackworth 1987) in which a logic for the interpretation of maps, to be applied to computer vision and intelligent graphics, is developed. It is argued that any adequate representation scheme for visual (and computer graphics) knowledge must make a distinction between knowledge of the image (the geometry) and knowledge of the scene (its linguistic interpretation), and about the relation between symbols at these two levels of representation; following Reiter and Mackworth (1987) we call this the depiction relation. In Reiter&apos;s system, two sets of first-order logic representing the scene and the image are employed. They express, respectively, the conceptual and geometrical knowledge about handdrawn sketch maps of geographical regions. In the view adopted here, the depiction relation corresponds to the translation function between constants of L and G as discussed above. An interpretation in Reiter&apos;s system is defined as a model, in the logical sense, of both sets of sentences and the depiction relation, and interpreting a drawing is a matter of finding all possible models of such sets of sentences. The domain for these models is determined by the set of individuals in the image and the scene of the picture that is being interpreted. Although computing the set of models of a set of first-order logical formulae is a very hard computational problem, the entities constituting a drawing normally form a finite set, which is often small. So, whether it is possible to compute the set of models of a given drawing is an empirical question. In particular, Reiter&apos;s system employs a constraint satisfaction algorithm to find all possible interpretations of maps, and the output of his system is a set of labels for such as &amp;quot;river&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;road&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;shore&amp;quot; for curves or chains, and &amp;quot;land region&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;water region&amp;quot; for areas. As mentioned above, finding the translation functions between G and L is a similar problem, with the same level of complexity. In Section 3.1, we present a constraint satisfaction algorithm for the induction of the translation into G of individual constants of L mentioned explicitly in the text of a multimodal message. also show how composite terms of be translated into their corresponding expressions of G (and subsequently of A second consideration in this section is that working out the translation between graphical and linguistic individual constants suggests a method for generating natural language expressions that refer to graphical objects and configurations. Note that inducing the linguistic translation of a graphical term that has not been mentioned overtly in the textual part of a multimodal message is the same as generating a linguistic description for the object denoted by the corresponding graphical term: once one knows the translation between individual constants of both of the modalities, the generation of multimodal descriptions can be achieved through the translation rules. For instance, in the map of Figure 4, if one points to the curve c1 once the translation individual constants has been found, the expression border between France and be generated. This strategy for producing natural language descriptions is discussed further in Section 3.2. 3.1 Resolution of Spatial Deixis From the point of view of our system, in interpreting multimodal messages like Fig- 1 and 2, what is given are expressions of L and expressions of what has to worked out is the composition and the reciprocal function note that the expressions of the graphical symbols on the drawings 180 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution parsing a drawing (an expression of type a syntactic structure of translation into the expression (which we called the map).

For this purpose we present an algorithm for establishing a relationship between individual constants of the graphical constants included in the expression map), which correspond to the interpretation domain algorithm for computing the translation function assigns a graphical constant to all proper names overtly mentioned in the linguistic part of a multimodal message (e.g., the graphisymbols d1, d2, d3, the linguistic constants Saarbri,icken, Frankfurt, The set of proper names appearing in a particular message will be referred to as the translations for linguistic constants of other types are given beforehand, once the translations for proper names are available, it is possible to find the graphical symbols and configurations that corefer with composite natural language descriptions through the translation rules between G, instance, once the regions representing France and Germany have identified, the term border between France and Germany be translated into an of denotes the corresponding curve, and also into the drawing of curve in denotes the border between France and Germany itself. Here, it is important to highlight that the translation for individual constants cannot normally be found with the overt information expressed through the multimodal message only. For working out the interpretation of Figure 2, for instance, we need, in addition to the text and graphics, knowledge about the geography of Europe and also knowledge about the interpretation conventions of maps. For the definition of the algorithm, a table representing the set of possible functions linguistics predicates (e.g., country, to their corresponding graphical (e.g, region, is defined. This table will be referred to as a table. For each particular interpretation task, a set of appropriate function tables is defined to the following rule: For each of that = , a function table that: = fx CTI[[X is a is true = E I is true} not empty. In case either of these two sets is empty no function table for the corresponding pair is defined. The function tables for our example are illustrated in Figure 17. Note that if only one cell of each column of a function table is filled in, a function from proper names to graphical constants is defined. Furthermore, if the result of this process is a table in which only one cell of each row is also marked, the function is one-to-one. Accordingly, if there are n names and m graphical objects, the first column a function table can be filled up in m different ways, the second in — different and so on, until objects have been assigned. As a consequence, function table with and m graphical objects defines m!/(m —</abstract>

Armed with these concepts, we can define an algorithm for working out the inof a multimodal message, as follows: Let be a sentence of part of the multimodal message), empty set of expressions of the set of possible translation models for for each is a translation model for and include its translation under = the semantic value of all expressions relation to the geometrical domain true, then a translation model for exclude all translation models have been tested, whether there is only one in so, that is the translation function; otherselect a new appropriate expression of general knowledge constraint) and its translation into repeat the process until there is only one For our example, 4 translations out of the 72 -y&apos;s in F will come out true for the first cycle of the algorithm in which the multimodal message is used as the only constraint (Example 5 in Section 2.3), as shown in Figure 20. To continue with the algorithm, some knowledge of the geography of Europe is required. For our problem the constraints relevant to interpreting the message are illustrated in Figure 21. The idea of the algorithm is simply to take constraints one at a time and produce the interpretation of the message incrementally. Considering constraint 1 in Figure 21, the translation functions (2) and (4) in Figure 20 can be removed; the translation function (3), in turn, can be ruled out either through constraints 2 or 3 (the interpretation the translation of constraint 1 into shown in Example 4 in Section 2.3). For the example, only three cycles of the algorithm are required to rule out all but the correct model in is the translation function (1) in Figure 20. This concludes the presentation of the procedure for interpreting proper names deictically in relation to a graphical context. Although only the interpretation of this kind of constant was required for our example, the interpretation of other kinds of terms, e.g. pronouns, can be carried out in the present framework. Consider that to be able to cope with multimodal messages in which pronouns were included in the part, as in Figure 1, a more general definition of the language be but in such an extension both proper names and pronouns would be con-</abstract>

For the definition of function tables, each present in a multimodal text would be included in the set as a first approximation, it would be a member of the domain of all function tables; different instances of the same pronoun would be considered two different objects the interpretation process (e.g., and the interpretation would worked out as shown above. It is also possible to think of a situation in which there are two or more graphical objects with the same name; in this context, proper names be considered kinds of pronouns, and from the point of view of different constant of category (nameo,namei, .) be assigned to each such graphical object. To differentiate these objects, alternative definite descriptions could obtained through the translation from constants of expressions of will be argued in Section 3.2, and such descriptions could be used in the context of the particular rhetorical structures and communicative purposes of multimodal messages. further consideration is that not only the constants of category a grammar can be used deictically; definite and indefinite descriptions can also be interpreted in this way. Consider that the textual part of the multimodal message in Figure 1 could have washed it, the man washed it, even man washed it all three terms 184 Pirteda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution man, man have to be interpreted deictically in relation to the graphical context. To be able to deal with this latter situation, descriptions can be interpreted in our approach if terms of this kind are also included in the set for the construction of function tables. More generally, our interpretation procedure defines a function from terms into individuals of the world through the graphical context. This is because although function tables define translation models between and graphical terms, graphical objects in the corresponding individuals in the world. We can think of our deictic interpretation procedure as a specific implementation for our graphical domain of Kaplan&apos;s operator DTHAT—in our simplified extensional language—which takes a term and maps it into an individual of the world in the interpretation context whenever the term is used deictically (Kaplan 1978). The interpretation of proper names and definite descriptions has long been a source of interesting semantic problems. Consider that linguistic terms serve to identify individuals, and whenever they are used, the individual they denote should exist. However, as pointed out by Donnellan and commented on by Kaplan, &amp;quot;using a definite description referentially a speaker may say something true even though the description correctly applies to nothing&amp;quot; (Kaplan 1978). For example, suppose a bachelor enters a room accompanied by a woman who is misintroduced as his wife. Someone notices the woman&apos;s solicitous attention to the man, says wife is kind to him. speaker uses the description wife refer to the woman, which implies that the bachelor has a wife (!), and nevertheless, what the speaker says is true. Here, one be inclined to say that wife to nothing, but if the woman is in the field of the speaker, it would be more proper to say that wife deto the woman. If the expression is kind to him been used instead, or the speaker had pointed to the woman at the time the expression kind to him were uttered, the deictic nature of the reference would be easily revealed. According to Kaplan, whenever a description is used referentially (as opposed to attributively), describing can be taken as a form of pointing, and as he suggested, instead of taking the sense of a description as the subject of a proposition, the sense is used only to fix the denotation, which is then taken directly as the subject of the proposition. Similarly, although a proper name is usually thought of as related to an individual (the bearer) in an intimate fashion through an interpretation function in model theory, and it is often stated that proper names are related to the same individual through all world and time indices (i.e., as rigid designators [Kripke 1972]), we would argue proper names can be also interpreted deictically to fix a referent, which can then be taken directly as the subject of a proposition. 3.2 Generation of Natural Language Descriptions The multimodal representation scheme and the resolution of deictic inferences presented above permit the generation of multimodal descriptions in a simple and systematic fashion. Once a multimodal representational system is fully defined, the generation of graphical and linguistic expressions can be achieved directly through the translation rules. As the crucial piece of knowledge required for use of the translation rules is the translation model, the deictic inference required to identify an individual and the inference required to generate a description for such an individual are but two sides of the same coin. If a graphical object is pointed out on the screen, a number of natural language descriptions to refer to it can be produced. Several strategies for finding an appropridescription are available, depending on whether the object pointed at is — base or whether it is an emergent object. Another consideration is whether the object has 185 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 a proper name or can be referred to either by a definite or an indefinite description. Suppose that a graphical cursor for pointing to graphical objects is available. The curitself is modeled as a graphical object of type the graphical domain. With this interactive device we can identify dots if the position of a dot in a drawing is the same as the position of the cursor, lines and curves if the cursor lies on the line or the curve, and regions if the cursor is inside or on the border of a region. With this device, we can select all basic or emergent graphical objects that are identified by an individual pointing act. Basic objects will be identified directly, and the emergent objects selected by a pointing act will be those that can be produced by the grammar satisfy the geometrical conditions associated with the cursor. Objects idenby a cursor will be terms of that be translated into proper names, definite descriptions, or indefinite descriptions. To refer to a graphical object we can the following simple strategy: if a graphical object can be translated into a proper name, use the proper name; if the graphical object can be translated as a description and it is the only one satisfying such a description, use a definite description; otherwise, use an indefinite description. a pointing action in which the dot the region r1 is selected. The from these objects, according to rule Tlp_G (a), are As these expressions can be translated into shown Figure 14, these objects can be referred to in However, consider that as these objects are the concrete extension of a number of concepts of objects can also be translated into rule T1p-c as A/THE(dot), and / THE(region), and they can be translated into city country. possible translation for the dot whenever it produced by rule S4p and translated into T4p_G is in turn can be translated into city of France. may be constants of cannot be translated into proper names. for instance, the line in Figure 4; the translation of this line into but as can be seen in Figure 14, there is no proper name that corresponds this expression in this constant could be translated by rule Tlp_G as the denoting concepts A/THE(line). As the line is also an emergent object that can be produced via the syntactic rule S2p, its translations according to rule T2p_G are subsequently, such an object can be referred to in line line from Paris to Frankfurt. similar example is the description of curve c1, which is produced by rule S3p and can be translated into L border between France and Germany. As mentioned in Section 1, the generation of descriptions is required within the of specific rhetorical and intentional structures, such as the of the WIP system, which employs Reiter and Dale&apos;s algorithm for the production of definite descriptions on demand. Our system can be used to support the of descriptions either definite or indefinite, and even pronouns used deictically, in multimodal generation systems with a solid semantic base. These descriptions could be used according to particular rhetorical and intentional structures related to domains. The advantage of such an approach is that the choice of the expressions to be used in multimodal presentations could be made not only on the basis predefined heuristics, but also on the basis of the semantic value of these sions in the context of use. In addition, the decision about what kind of knowledge is expressed through either modality for the production of coordinated natural language and graphical explanations could take into account not only the kind of heuristics that are currently employed in systems like WIP and COMET, but also the expressiveness and effectiveness criteria of natural and graphical languages. 186 Pineda and Garza Multimodal Reference Resolution discourse referents translation conditions graphical conditions conditions -- Figure 22 the multimodal discourse representation structure. 4. Multimodal Discourse Representation Theory The ability to interpret individual multimodal messages is a prerequisite for interpreting sequences of multimodal messages occurring in the normal flow of interactive conversations. In the same sense that discourse theories, like DRT, are designed to interpret sequences of sentences, it is desirable to have a theory in which sequences of multimodal messages can be interpreted. Such a theory would have to support anaphoric and deictic resolution models in an integrated fashion, and would have to be placed in a larger pragmatic setting in which intentions and presuppositions are considered, and in which mechanisms to retrieve knowledge from memory are also taken into account. To work out such a theory is quite an ambitious goal; however, in the same way that DRT focuses in internal structural processes that govern anaphoric resolution, it is plausible to consider a multimodal discourse representation theory (MDRT) to cope with the resolution of spatial deictic inferences. In the same way that DRT postulates discourse representation structures in which referents and conditions are introduced incrementally through the interpretation of the incoming natural language discourse by means of the application of construction rules, it is plausible to conceive similar multimodal discourse representation structures (MDRS) whose referents and conditions would be introduced by modality-dependent construction rules acting upon the expressions of the corresponding modality. In these structures, DRS conditions extracted from different modalities would be kept in separate partitions, but discourse referents would be abstract objects common to the whole MDRS. In particular, MDRS&apos;s could help to specify accessibility relations between anaphoric and deictic terms and their antecedents and interpretation context, imposing severe constraints on the possible interpretations, as is normal in DRT. The resolution process itself would be accomplished by incremental constraint satisfaction, as shown for deictic inferences. In the rest of this section, we present a schematic picture of how an MDRS can be developed, and illustrate using the interpretation of the multimodal message in Figure 2. Consider first the empty MDRS in Figure 22. The MDRS is a structure with four partitions; it extends traditional DRS with one partition for graphical conditions and another to store the translation models that hold in a particular interpretation state. The partition for linguistic conditions is used as in normal DRS, and the top partition for referents includes a variable for every individual that is referred to in the multimodal message in either of the 23 illustrates the initial state for the interpretation of the message in Figure 2. Graphical expressions of map) are included in the graphical section of the MDRS, and textual conditions, with the associated information, are included in the linguistic section as in normal DRS.

In the same way that the order of processing of linguistic information is not crucial for the definition of the linguistic conditions, we abstract over scanning considerations and assume that graphical expressions are introduced as a single Finally, the partition for the possible translation models is empty at this stage, as the coreference relation between text and graphics has not yet been established. The interpretation process by constraint satisfaction is illustrated in Figure 24. Figure 24(a) illustrates the interpretation state after the first cycle of the constraint satisfaction algorithm presented in Section 3.1 has been carried out. In this state, the partition for the translation conditions contains the disjunction of the four possible translation models that are consistent with the message, taking the message itself as the only interpretation constraint. Figure 24(b) illustrates the interpretation state once the additional constraint that Germany is to the east of France has been The interpretation of the corresponding expression introduces two addidiscourse referents (n6 and the terms the textual part of the message should be resolved anaphorically in relation to the context previously built. However, this anaphoric resolution process is kept within the linguistic section of the MDRS and should take into account the accessibility constraints between anaphor and antecedent, as commonly done in DRT. The result of this anaphoric inis reflected in the equality conditions = n3 = n2. inclusion the constraint is to the east of France us to rule out two possible translation models, and the result of the second cycle of the constraint satisfaction 20 We leave for further research whether the analysis of scanning protocols by means of eye-tracking techniques can provide information for imposing additional constraints on accessibility relations and possible translation models for the construction of MDRS&apos;s. An interesting antecedent for the definition of such constraints can be found in Faraday and Sutcliffe (1998). 21 How this constraint is selected is beyond the scope of this paper and we only make the assumption that the symbols in the graphical and linguistic partitions of the MDRS form a part of the indexing scheme required to retrieve the information from memory. For a prototype implementation, this kind of constraint could be provided by the human user directly.</abstract>
