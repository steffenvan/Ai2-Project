This is a collection of papers on natural language
parsing and the formal description of natural languages.
Most of the papers were originally presented at an
interdisciplinary workshop, Word-order and Parsing in
Unification Grammars, that was held in Friedenweiler,
West Germany, in April 1986. However, two studies
have been especially written for this volume, and an
extensive introduction by Reyle and Rohrer has been
added to outline the contents of the book and to provide
the readers who are less familiar with unification-based
formalisms with the necessary background information
that the authors of the papers assumed to be known.
At the workshop mentioned above, the issue of the
possible contribution of linguistic theories to natural
language processing and vice versa was discussed. It
was also meant as a central topic of the book under
review (cf. its title), but in fact only one of the papers
(by Shieber, who opens the volume) is directly con-
cerned with the interplay between theoretical and com-
putational linguistics, while in others the subject is
touched on in a more or less parenthetical way. Gener-
ally, the authors agree that linguistic theories and nat-
ural language parsing may benefit from drawing on the
experience of each other; that an implementation of a
declaratively described theory may encounter difficul-
ties (cf. the paper by Boguraev, who demonstrates it
with the example of GPSG); and that linguists should
not be discouraged from inventing new grammar formal-
isms, and ease of implementation must not be the only
criterion for a linguistic theory. However, we do not go
far beyond remarks of this kind, and the contents of the
book may seem rather disappointing in comparison with
its promising title.
This does not lessen the value of particular contribu-
tions to the volume. Because German is, no wonder, the
language referred to in many of the papers, and French
as well as Japanese are represented too, the book does
not show the usual, though irritating, tendency of
computational linguistic literature to infer very general
statements concerning language on the basis of English
(as if there were no other languages in the world!). In
some of the papers, problems of German word order are
considered, as well as non-local dependencies and co-
ordination; in some others, questions of semantic rep-
resentation are addressed.
Most of the contributors to this volume work in the
framework of unification grammars (LFG and GPSG)
but there is also a paper on parsing with a Government
and Binding grammar (Wehrli), and two attempts to
combine unification with categorial grammars (Zeevat
and Whitelock). In addition, the applicability of indexed
grammars, which fall in between context-free and con-
text-sensitive grammars, is discussed (Gazdar).
Because of the wide range of issues it covers, the
book can serve as supplementary reading for advanced
courses in computational linguistics. Thus, apart from
scholars and programmers dealing with natural language
grammars and parsers, the work under review will
interest students and teachers.

Language, Warsaw University, has MSc,s in both computer
science and linguistics. His recent research has concentrated
on the problems of evaluating natural language parsers, and on
parsing Polish. Batiko&apos;s address is: Instytut Jczyka Polskiego,

This book describes work in the areas of semantics and
reference resolution for text understanding, exploring
the idea of early semantic analysis. These ideas were
implemented in a Prolog program for analyzing word
problems in physics at the University of Edinburgh as
part of the author&apos;s Ph.D. thesis.
Early semantic analysis is an attempt to &amp;quot;bring
forward parts of the semantic processing before or
during syntactic analysis&amp;quot; (p. 13). This means that
semantic interpretation goes on incrementally through-
out processing, rather than all at once at some pre-
defined point, such as immediately after parsing. In the
case of reference resolution, early semantic analysis
means that the text must be seen as incrementally
providing constraints on the types and identities of
entities mentioned. This information is input to a con-
straint-satisfaction procedure that evaluates references.
It seems that the system expects that eventually there
will be enough constraining information to narrow the
choice of candidates down to one, but it is not clear how
long the system will wait for such information, or what
it does if there isn&apos;t enough information available at the
time when it has to make a choice. Mellish discusses
