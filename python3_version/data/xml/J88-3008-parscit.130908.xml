1 INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.984678576923077">
Many current research efforts have focused on building
cooperative systems that interact with their users in a
natural language such as English. To be effective, these
systems must be robust, their dialog must be coherent,
and their responses must be helpful to the user. A user
model (UM), which can be modified during the interac-
tion to represent updated beliefs about the current user,
is one mechanism that can contribute to a robust,
coherent, and cooperative dialog.
In general, when we as speakers describe certain
situations, we try to communicate these situations to
our listeners. As proposed by some researchers
(Webber 1978, Kamp 1984), speakers do so by attempt-
ing to get their listeners to construct an appropriate
model: a discourse model. A discourse model (DM) is
viewed as containing representations of entities, along
with their properties and relations they participate in.
The key, then, in successful communication is for the
speaker to transmit as much information about those
entities, their properties and relations to the listener so
as to achieve the goals of the current interaction. From
the point of view of a system, a computational discourse
model is used by the system to generate and/or interpret
a discourse.
This paper focuses on the relationship between DMs
and UMs. It starts by describing what a DM is, and the

role it plays in a coherent dialog. It then describes what
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989045095238095">
a UM is, and the role it plays in a cooperative dialog. I
argue that the DM should be viewed as one part of the
UM—that is, as one part of the system&apos;s model of the
user. The examples of the natural language interactions
are presented in the context of a natural language
interface to an expert system that provides advice on
cooking with chilies. (Part of the data was taken from
the section &amp;quot;Cooking with Chilies&amp;quot; that appeared in
Bon Appetit magazine, December 1986. The expert
system can provide information about the different
varieties of chili peppers as well as descriptions of how
to &amp;quot;turn down the heat&amp;quot; of the chilies (make them less
spicy), and how to cook with them without getting any
kind of skin or eye irritations.) I justify this by showing
how DMs can be viewed as part of UMs and how both
models can affect each other. In other words, part of the
UMs that systems have correspond to the DM, that is,
a representation of what is talked about in a specific
interaction. This piece, which changes with each dis-
course, affects the UM and varies from interaction to
interaction.

2 DESCRIPTION OF DISCOURSE MODELS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959296619047619">
A piece of discourse is a collection of utterances that are
spoken by one or more speakers. Usually the sentences
in a discourse are connected in a way that makes them
comprehensible and coherent. One way in which sen-
tences in a piece of discourse are connected is via the
use of anaphoric expressions. In general, anaphoric
expressions refer to things that have been mentioned
previously in clauses. (Note that there may be cases in
which the anaphoric expression may refer to an entity
that will be mentioned afterwards (i.e., cataphora)
rather than before it, as in the following:
i. After he finished the race, John went drinking to
celebrate his victory.
In this paper, I am concerned only with anaphoric
expressions that refer to entities previously mentioned,
such as:
ii. After John finished the race, he went drinking to
celebrate his victory).
In English, anaphoric pronouns contribute to coherence
in the discourse by avoiding repetitions of entities
already mentioned. Consider the following:

where instead of repeating &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pepper&amp;quot; we
have used the pronouns &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;, respectively.
We use sentences in the discourse to describe certain
situations to our listeners. This we do by attempting to
get our listeners to construct an appropriate model: a
discourse model. A speaker&apos;s DM enables him to gen-
erate what he believes will be coherent utterances.
Similarly, the listener&apos;s DM enables him to comprehend
discourse in an organized manner. Several researchers
(Webber 1978, Kamp 1984, Heim 1982, Sag and
Hankamer 1984) have been concerned with how DMs
can be used to identify the referent of an anaphoric
expression. (Not all these authors use the term &amp;quot;dis-
course model&amp;quot;. For instance, Kamp (1981) describes
the utterances as being represented in a discourse
representation structure (DRS). The entities mentioned
in the sentence are represented in the DRS and they are
called discourse referents (DRs). Heim&apos;s (1982) frame-
work is the File Change Semantics.) They have sug-
gested that speaker and listener each build a model of
the discourse from the incoming sentences, including
representations of the entities introduced by the dis-
course, their properties, and the relations they partici-
pate in. When an entity is later referred to via an
anaphoric expression, the discourse participants can
use their DM to make the appropriate link to an entity
and hence interpret that anaphoric expression correctly.
Some of the work on anaphora has concentrated in
describing what characterizes the entities in the DM.
For instance, Webber (1978) looked at the problem of
definite noun phrases (where the references are to
individuals and sets) and Schuster (1986, 1988) is look-
ing at references to events and actions. The description
of how things, sets, events, actions, facts, and so on,
are represented in a discourse model and how one can
refer to them gives us a clue to what characterizes a
discourse model. Because the representations in the
discourse model are of specific objects or events which
are talked about during the interaction, the discourse
model can be viewed as a temporary knowledge base.
Since a discourse has relatively short duration, the
discourse model that supports the interaction contains
short term or temporary information.
It is important to note that the representations of
entities, as they appear in the discourse have a structure
as proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986). While Grosz
and Sidner do not specifically deal with discourse
models, their view on discourse is applicable to dis-
course models. The discourse model reflects the struc-
ture of the dialog. In the same way that items are
highlighted in the actual discourse, they appear as being
more salient in the discourse model. Because some
items are more salient than others, the representation is
not just a flat representation, but has a hierarchical
structure in which the more salient entities are repre-
sented in the same way as they appear in the discourse.
The structure is needed because the ordering of the
representations does not necessarily correspond to the
order in which the entities are mentioned in the dis-
course. A focusing mechanism plays a very important
role in understanding discourse. This mechanism is
needed to process sentences at any point in the dis-
course by indicating which objects, things, events, or
facts are more salient at any point in the discourse.
When processing a part of discourse, only those entities
that are salient come into play.

3 A VIEW OF USER MODELS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9965185">
In this paper, the UM is viewed as &amp;quot;the system&apos;s beliefs
about its users&amp;quot;. Many views have been proposed to
describe what UMs are. The various UMs proposed so
far fall under the general category described here. For
example, this definition of UMs includes McCoy&apos;s
(1985) concept of a UM: the system&apos;s beliefs about how
the user views objects in the domain. It also includes
Paris&apos;s definition of a UM: the system&apos;s beliefs about
the user&apos;s levels of expertise as well as the definition of
UMs as viewed by researchers concerned with plan
recognition: the system&apos;s beliefs about what the user is
trying to do.
Many distinctions have been made when character-
izing user models. Kobsa (1985) and Kass and Finin
(this issue) distinguish between user models and agent
models. (Kobsa actually uses the term Akteurmodell
(actor model) since, according to him, the primary
meaning of the German Agent is &amp;quot;secret (foreign)
agent&amp;quot;) For them, the agent model is the model of the
person that the system can model and there can be
many agent models. The user model is the model of the
specific agent that interacts with the system. Often the
agent model and the user model coincide. In this paper,
I will assume that this is the case. Also, Rich (1979)
distinguishes between models of individual users and
models for classes of users, as well as between long-
term as compared to short-term UMs. This notion of
short- and long-term UMs provides a spectrum of parts
of the UM, some of which are temporary and some of
which remain after the discourse ends. I will show more
on this issue in the next section.
In this paper, I assume that the system has represen-
tations for three possible stereotypes of users: a begin-
ner, an intermediate, and an expert. The system can
modify its own user model as the interaction occurs, as
a result of the information that flows out from the
discourse model into the user model. Thus the user
model is dynamic. In general, information that is rele-
vant to the user and which is represented in the DM
becomes part of the UM.
Consider a simulated expert system HOT, which
provides information about cooking with chilies. The
system provides advice to aficionados (amateurs) about
buying, cutting, peeling, storing, and cooking with
chilies. The system also has a general UM from which it
can identify three possible users: beginner, intermedi-
ate, and expert. These are canonical UMs, and they are
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 83
Ethel Schuster Establishing 1112 Relationship Between Discourse Models and User Models
representations of three potential classes of users of the
system. The beginner stereotype contains information
about simple and well-known varieties of chili peppers.
It also contains information about storing chilies. The
stereotype for intermediate users assumes that the user
knows more than a beginner, while an expert is assumed
to know about unusual varieties of peppers and to be
interested in more sophisticated information concerning
chili peppers and detailed information about using dif-
ferent kinds of them.
The users interact with the system by asking ques-
tions. From these, HOT can decide how to fit each user
into any of the particular UMs that it has available.
Also, the sample responses from HOT are used as a way
of demonstrating how the UM participates in the dis-
course. In other words, the responses show evidence of
interaction between the UM and the DM. The following
example illustrates the interaction between HOT and
one of its users.
2. U: Hi! I love to eat spicy food and I love to cook
with chilies. I just found some fresh peppers in the
health food store called banana-peppers and I was
told they are very hot. How can I peel them?
From this introduction the system can deduce that the
user is an intermediate user in cooking with chilies, and
invokes the stereotype for intermediate users. How
does the system decide that this user is an intermediate
and not a beginner? Firstly, the user explicitly mentions
that he likes to eat and cook spicy food. Also, the
system can realize that a more experienced person in
spicy food knows about the need to peel hot chilies
(sometimes), while a novice may not realize that some
kinds of peppers need to be peeled. And an expert
would know how to peel hot peppers. These facts
trigger the intermediate stereotype in the user modeling
system. Notice that the user mentions specific entities
(e.g., himself, peppers, health food stores, and so on) as
well as events: &amp;quot;user loves to eat spicy food&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;user
cooks&amp;quot;, and so on. All these entities and event descrip-
tions are represented in the DM and they are used to
infer the correct level of the user in the UM. This fact is
evidence that the DM is part of the UM. Once the
system has decided that the user is an intermediate, it
can respond not only in terms of what the user wants to
know, but also what will be most helpful to the user.

4 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DM AND UM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998712195122">
In the previous sections I have shown the role of the
DM in a user-system interaction. I have also described
the role that a UM plays in a user-system interaction.
The system uses the information in the UM to decide
what kind of user it is interacting with, as well as how to
respond to the particular user.
Given the definition of UMs in the previous section,
the DM seems to clearly be part of the UM, that is, it is
the system&apos;s beliefs about what the user believes about
the discourse. The question then is whether the DM is
the system&apos;s beliefs about the discourse or is it the
system&apos;s beliefs about the user&apos;s beliefs about the
discourse. I would argue that it is the latter. It has been
claimed that both dialog participants must be focused on
the same subset of knowledge for communication to be
successful. If the system has a DM that allows it to
comprehend utterances one way and the user has a DM
that causes it to interpret an utterance differently, the
interaction is going to fail. So if the system is going to
use its DM to generate utterances that it believes the
user can understand as the system intended, then it
must believe that its DM reflects the user&apos;s beliefs about
what has been talked about. (One might argue that we
have to go all the way to mutual beliefs—namely, that
the DM is the system&apos;s beliefs about what is mutually
believed about the discourse.)
Furthermore, if the DM were separate from the UM,
then an entity introduced by the discourse could always
be referred to. But that may not be possible unless the
system believes the user knows about this particular
entity. On the other hand, if the DM is part of the UM,
then only those entities that the system believes the user
knows about can be represented implicitly in the DM,
since in this case the DM must represent the system&apos;s
beliefs about the user&apos;s beliefs about the discourse.
Then the system can only coherently refer to entities
that it believes the user knows about, since these are the
only ones represented in its DM.
In the previous section, I described a view of UMs
with three stereotypes. Pictorially, this can be seen as a
kernel of information with several possible levels:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.440309">
Expert
I Inter
I I Novice I I
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97682175">
The INITIAL-UM is the representation of the UM that
the system has initially (before any interaction). During
its interaction with the user, the system builds the DM.
In turn, information taken from this DM is used to
update the INITIAL-UM into an UPDATED-UM. The
UPDATED-UM becomes a FINAL-UM when the in-
teraction ends (possibly after several updates). Note
that only parts of the FINAL-UM persists for future use
after the current interaction ends.
All the information that the user provides is repre-
sented in the DM. Consider the following:
3. U: I want to know how to peel banana-peppers.
Imagine, my mother was in Mexico and I asked
her to buy some for me. She decided to try one of
them and she burnt her throat. She had to be
rushed to the hospital, blah, blah, blah.

<bodyText confidence="0.990560056603774">
Ethel Schuster Establishing the Relationship Between Discourse Models and User Models
This information is also part of the UM. Given the
definition of the UM as the system&apos;s beliefs about the
user, then this information provided by the user is the
system&apos;s beliefs about the user&apos;s beliefs about what has
occurred. For instance, now the system believes that
the user believes that you can buy banana-peppers in
Mexico.
In replying to its users, the system not only decides
what information to include in the reply, but can also
use anaphoric expressions (i.e. pronouns) in its re-
sponses. The only way the system could have used
those pronouns was by having a representation of the
discourse in which the mentioned entities were repre-
sented and available for reference. Also, since the
system responded in terms of its model of the users,
only if the DM is part of the UM, can the system take it
into account in its responses and its reasoning about the
users. Both the UM and the DM were needed in
creating the response, not only because of the specific
information used in the response, but also in the way in
which that information was actually presented to the
users. In other words, the DM is part of what the system
needs to consult when responding to its users.
One of the ways to identify how the UM contains the
DM is by looking for what information might be in the
UM but not in the DM. In the earlier examples, the
responses generated by HOT made use of information
taken from the stereotype invoked for the individual
user. This information was not present in (or implied by)
the previous discourse. Hence the UM contains infor-
mation that does not appear in the DM.
Note also that the DM can affect the rest of the UM.
Suppose a user comes often in contact with the system,
and keeps referring to the same things. After several
interactions, these things the user mentions should
eventually become part of the long-term UM. The
question that is left is whether it is indeed worthwhile to
perform this transfer from the DM into the long-term
UM. For instance, if a user talks about the same things
over a course of several interactions and the informa-
tion is moved to the UM, what happens if the user stops
talking about those specific things? Do we then delete
the information from the UM and allow for new infor-
mation to come in? Also, with respect to the short- and
long-term UMs, we could consider the short-term parts
to be the DM, which is removed once it is no longer
relevant. The intermediate parts could correspond to
the beliefs that the system has about what the user is
trying to do. And the long term would be the beliefs
about the user&apos;s level of expertise, his likes, or dislikes.
These are among the many issues that remain to be
solved.

The various UMs proposed so far fall under the general category described here. For example, this definition of UMs includes McCoy&apos;s (1985) concept of a UM: the system&apos;s beliefs about how the user views objects in the domain. It also includes Paris&apos;s definition of a UM: the system&apos;s beliefs about the user&apos;s levels of expertise as well as the definition of UMs as viewed by researchers concerned with plan recognition: the system&apos;s beliefs about what the user is trying to do. Many distinctions have been made when characterizing user models. Kobsa (1985) and Kass and Finin (this issue) distinguish between user models and agent models. (Kobsa actually uses the term Akteurmodell (actor model) since, according to him, the primary meaning of the German Agent is &amp;quot;secret (foreign) agent&amp;quot;) For them, the agent model is the model of the person that the system can model and there can be many agent models. The user model is the model of the specific agent that interacts with the system. Often the agent model and the user model coincide. In this paper, I will assume that this is the case. Also, Rich (1979) distinguishes between models of individual users</context>

I will show more on this issue in the next section. In this paper, I assume that the system has representations for three possible stereotypes of users: a beginner, an intermediate, and an expert.

When an entity is later referred to via an anaphoric expression, the discourse participants can use their DM to make the appropriate link to an entity and hence interpret that anaphoric expression correctly. Some of the work on anaphora has concentrated in describing what characterizes the entities in the DM. For instance, Webber (1978) looked at the problem of definite noun phrases (where the references are to individuals and sets) and Schuster (1986, 1988) is looking at references to events and actions. The description of how things, sets, events, actions, facts, and so on, are represented in a discourse model and how one can refer to them gives us a clue to what characterizes a discourse model. Because the representations in the discourse model are of specific objects or events which are talked about during the interaction, the discourse model can be viewed as a temporary knowledge base. Since a discourse has relatively short duration, the discourse model that supports the interaction contains short term or temporary information. It is </context>

To be effective, these systems must be robust, their dialog must be coherent, and their responses must be helpful to the user. A user model (UM), which can be modified during the interaction to represent updated beliefs about the current user, is one mechanism that can contribute to a robust, coherent, and cooperative dialog. In general, when we as speakers describe certain situations, we try to communicate these situations to our listeners. As proposed by some researchers (Webber 1978, Kamp 1984), speakers do so by attempting to get their listeners to construct an appropriate model: a discourse model. A discourse model (DM) is viewed as containing representations of entities, along with their properties and relations they participate in. The key, then, in successful communication is for the speaker to transmit as much information about those entities, their properties and relations to the listener so as to achieve the goals of the current interaction. From the point of view of a system, a computational discourse model is used by the system to generate and/or interpret a di</context>
