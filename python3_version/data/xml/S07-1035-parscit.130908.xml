<bodyText confidence="0.9993237">
We have participated in the Multilingual
Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task of
SemEval-2007. Our system disambiguates
senses of Chinese words and finds the
correct translation in English by using the
web as WSD knowledge source. Since all
the statistic data is obtained from search
engine, the method is considered to be
unsupervised and does not require any
sense-tagged corpus.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999976743589743">
Due to the lack of sense tagged corpora (and the
difficulty of manually creating them), the
unsupervised method tries to avoid, or at least to
reduce, the knowledge acquisition problem, which
the supervised methods have to deal with. In order
to tackle the problem of the knowledge acquisition
bottleneck, we adopted an unsupervised approach
based on search engine, which does not require any
sense tagged corpus.
The majority of methods using the Web often try
to automatically generate sense tagged corpora
(Agirre and Martinez 2000;Agirre and Martinez
2004;Gonzalo et al. 2003; Mihalcea and Moldovan
1999;Santamaria et al. 2003). In this paper, we
experiment with our initial attempt on another
research trend that uses the Web not for extracting
training samples but helping disambiguate directly
during the translation selection process.
The approach we present here is inspired by
(Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Brill 2003; Rosso
et al. 2005; Dagan et al. 2006; McCarthy 2002).
Suppose that source ambiguous words are apt to
appear with its target translation on bilingual web
pages either parallel or non-parallel. Instead of
searching the source language or target language
respectively on web, we try to let the search engine
think in a bilingual style. First, our system gets the
co-occurrence information of Chinese context and
its corresponding English context. Then it computes
association measurements of Chinese context and
English context in 4 kinds of way. Finally, it
selects the correct English translation by
computing the association measurements.
In view that this is the first international standard
evaluation to predict the correct English translation
for ambiguous Chinese word, we built HIT-WSD
system as our first attempt on disambiguation by using
bilingual web search and just want to testify validity
of our method.

HIT-WSD system disambiguates senses of Chinese
target ambiguous word and finds the correct
translation in English by searching bilingual
information on the web. Figure 1 gives the
flowchart of our proposed approach. Given an
ambiguous word with a Chinese sentence, we
easily create its Chinese context. English context
can be acquired from a Chinese-English dictionary and
the translation mapping set(offered by the
Multilingual Chinese-English Lexical Sample
Task). System puts Chinese context and English
context as queries on search engine individually
and collectively. After this step, frequency and co-
occurrence frequency of Chinese context and English

context will be found. Finally, our system selects the
most probable English translation by computing
association measurements.
Figure 2 gives an example of how the proposed
approach selects English translations of the
Chinese ambiguous word “动摇/dongyao” given
the sentence and its translation mapping set. This
instance comes from the training data of Multilin-
gual Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task of Sem-
eval2007. According to the translation mapping set,
Chinese target word “ 动 摇 /dongyao” has two
English Translations: shake and vacillate.
English Context Candidates set is the
translations set of the Chinese context. System uses
translation mapping set to translate Chinese target
ambiguous word and uses an Chinese-English
dictionary to translate other words in Chinese
context. English Context Candidates set could be
any combination of translations and each
combination could be selected as the English context.
After getting the Chinese context and English
context, we put them as queries to search engine
and extract page counts (which can be considered
as frequency) which search engine returned. We
not only search Chinese context and English
context individually, but also put them together to
search engine.
Association measurements: the Dice coefficient,
point-wise mutual information, Log Likelihood
score andχP2P score are computed in the third phase
while we got all kinds of statistic results from
search engine. Finally, we determine the
translation by simply computing the association
measurements

Although the Chinese context can be represented
with local features, topic features, parts of speech
and so on, we use sentence segment as Chinese
context in our experiment system. The sentence
segment is a window size ± n segment of the
sentence including the ambiguous words.
English Context Candidates set could be any
combination of the translation of words appearing
in Chinese context. In our experiment system, we
just choose the translation of the Chinese target
ambiguous words in the translation mapping set as
English context.
We choose googleTP1PT and baiduTP2PT as our search
engine, for they are both most widely used for
English and Chinese language respectively.
Putting Chinese context and English context as
queries to the search engine, we will get
corresponding page counts it returned as figure 2
shows.
Four statistical measurements were used in order
to measure the degree of association of Chinese
Context (CC) and English Context (EC). CC and
EC can be seen as two random events occuring in

In SemEval-2007, we participated in Multilingual
Chinese-English Lexical Sample Task with a fully
unsupervised system based on bilingual web search.
Our initial experiment result shows that our system
fails to reach MFS (Most Familiar Sense) baseline
due to our method is too simple where search
queries are formed (just uses simple context
window and English target translation). Our
approach is the first attempt so far as we know on
using bilingual web search for translation selection
directly. The system is very simple but seemed to
achieve a not bad performance when considered
the performance of fully unsupervised systems in
SENSEVAL-2, SENSEVAL -3 English tasks.
For future research, we will investigate the
dependency of bilingual documents, optimize the
search queries, filter out potential noises and
combine the different results in order to devise an
improved method that can utilize bilingual web
search better.

In order to tackle the problem of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, we adopted an unsupervised approach based on search engine, which does not require any sense tagged corpus. The majority of methods using the Web often try to automatically generate sense tagged corpora (Agirre and Martinez 2000;Agirre and Martinez 2004;Gonzalo et al. 2003; Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Santamaria et al. 2003). In this paper, we experiment with our initial attempt on another research trend that uses the Web not for extracting training samples but helping disambiguate directly during the translation selection process. The approach we present here is inspired by (Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Brill 2003; Rosso et al. 2005; Dagan et al. 2006; McCarthy 2002). Suppose that source ambiguous words are apt to appear with its target translation on bilingual web pages either parallel or non-parallel. Instead of searching the source language or target language respectively on web, we try </context>

Suppose that source ambiguous words are apt to appear with its target translation on bilingual web pages either parallel or non-parallel. Instead of searching the source language or target language respectively on web, we try to let the search engine think in a bilingual style. First, our system gets the co-occurrence information of Chinese context and its corresponding English context. Then it computes association measurements of Chinese context and English context in 4 kinds of way. Finally, it selects the correct English translation by computing the asso</context>
