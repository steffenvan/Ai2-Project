Take a finite set T of trees, and close it under the operation of substitution—replacing
daughterless nonterminals by other trees in T whose root node label matches the
nonterminal. The set of all terminal strings of trees in the resultant tree-set will be a
context-free language (CFL), and for every CFL there will be such a finite set of trees
that generates it under substitution. For an elegant formalization of CFLs in these
terms, see Rogers (1999, pages 25–26).
Now assume an additional operation: besides substituting trees for daughterless
nonterminals, you can also squeeze new material into the middle of a tree, substituting
it for a nonterminal node that has daughters. More precisely, assume a finite set A of
insertable trees that share a special form: each A E A has a single node on its frontier,
known as A’s foot node, that has the same label as A’s root. Squeezing some A E A
into a tree T E T means replacing a node n in T so that n’s mother becomes the
mother of A’s root, and everything dominated by n comes to be dominated by A’s
foot node.
Closing T under the operation of squeezing in new material from A in this manner
(an operation called tree adjunction) yields a tree-set of which the set of all terminal
strings will be a tree adjoining language (TAL), and for every TAL there will be an
appropriate pair (T, A). Such a pair (called a tree adjunct grammar in Joshi, Levy, and
Takahashi [1975]) is known today as a tree adjoining grammar (TAG).
The research program on TAGs that Aravind Joshi has led since 1975 is perhaps the
most interesting and significant research program in formal language theory of the last
40 years. General linguists have clearly underrated it, though computational linguists
have in general kept more closely in touch with it. The TALs are a mathematically
natural class with closure and decision properties very similar to those of the CFLs,
including a polynomial-time recognition problem. Several independent but equivalent
characterizations of the class have been discovered: Vijay-shanker and Weir (1994)
present a weak equivalence result for head grammars (Pollard 1984; Roach 1987), lin-
ear indexed grammars (Duske and Parchmann 1984; Gazdar 1988), and combinatory
categorial grammars (Steedman 1986). Additionally, Vijayashanker (1988) gave a char-
acterization in terms of embedded pushdown automata; and Rogers (1998) gives a
new model-theoretic characterization in terms of linearized terminal strings of three-
dimensional tree models of monadic second-order logic formulae.

Moreover, the descriptive capabilities of TAGs make them as plausible a theory of
syntax for natural languages as has ever emerged from formal language theory. The
ways in which TAGs exceed the descriptive capacity of context-free grammars seems
remarkably close to what one would want in a theory of syntax sculpted for human
languages.
However, like relational grammar in the 1970s and optimality theory in the 1990s,
the theory of TAGs has never had the book-length exposition it deserves: there has
been no coherent and comprehensive published monograph by the original developers
that gives an integrated account of the framework and convincing examples of its
application to a well-known language.
Tree Adjoining Grammars, edited by Anne Abeill´e and Owen Rambow, does not
entirely fill that gap, though it goes some of the way. It is a refereed collection of
papers that were presented in earlier versions at an international workshop on TAGs
and related formalisms in Paris in 1994. The editors contribute a substantial intro-
duction, and the 18 other chapters are grouped into three sections: (1) “Formalisms,”
(2) “Linguistic Analysis,” and (3) “Processing.”
I cannot here summarize or critique all the papers in this rich collection, but I will
comment briefly on a few of the papers that I think would on their own justify the
purchase of the book (especially at CSLI’s attractively low price of under $25 for the
paperback).
Chapter 1 is an impressive 68-page essay by Abeill´e and Rambow. An expansion
of this essay with fuller exemplification and more precision in formulation, perhaps
coauthored with Joshi, might have made an independent monograph on TAGs that
would have filled the gap referred to above. But instead this lengthy essay is just an
extended introduction to an anthology. It is not without flaws. For example, its intro-
duction of the crucial notion “lexicalized” is remarkably casual and does not really
permit one to discern what the definition is. (My understanding is that in a lexical-
ized TAG, each of the trees in T must contain one and only one terminal symbol
[word in the dictionary]. But in that case, the diagrams in this chapter never really
give an example of a lexicalized TAG, which is odd, since the authors take this con-
cept to be centrally important.) That said, however, the amount of work this chapter
represents is substantial, and the standard of exposition is mostly high. It does a lot
more than the usual summary-of-the-rest-of-the-book that is typical for an editorial
introduction.
Chapter 2, by Roger Evans, Gerald Gazdar, and David Weir, has an oversubtle
title that is ruined by capitalization of significant words on the chapter title page and
in the running heads. The title should read as follows:
“Lexical Rules” are just lexical rules.
The thesis is that the theoretical machinery needed to state the sort of lexical rules that
everybody assumes (like the one that assigns irregular plurals in -i to certain Latinate
nouns ending in -us), properly understood, suffices to take over all the work of the
special class of generative “Lexical Rules” that many frameworks recognize—the rules
for covering phenomena like the active/passive relation between verb subcategoriza-
tion frames. A full consideration of what is needed to state the former type of lexical
generalization in the representation language DATR reveals that such mechanisms
can also handle the (apparently) heavier stuff. Building on earlier work by the authors
(Evans, Gazdar, and Weir 1995), this elegant paper shows how to state lexicalized
TAGs compactly and nonredundantly using DATR, and how to express a variety of
so-called Lexical Rules without positing any additional devices.

Chapter 6, “Complexity of Scrambling: A New Twist to the Competence-Perform-
ance Distinction” by Aravind K. Joshi, Tilman Becker, and Owen Rambow, deserves
to become known as a classic. It proposes that certain limitations on scrambling (re-
ordering of clausal constituents) in German should not be treated as performance limits
(in the way the limits on center-embedding in English usually are) because there is
a way to make them follow from a grammar formalism (namely, TAGs), and this
provides a better explanation than positing a performance restriction stemming from
some unknown psychological or neurological basis. In other words, the paper advo-
cates letting the syntactic theory decide: whether a theory is available that will draw a
certain syntactic distinction should be a relevant factor in deciding when and whether
performance limitations are to be invoked. The argument is clever, convincing, and
quite surprising.
Chapter 12, “Implications of Binding for Lexicalized Grammars” by Mark Steed-
man, is a characteristically wide-ranging and interesting look at what binding phe-
nomena mean for transformational grammar, generalized phrase structure grammar,
head-driven phrase structure grammar, TAGs, and various types of categorial gram-
mar (recall that Steedman’s combinatory categorial grammar is weakly equivalent to
TAGs).
Many other papers in the volume will repay study. Among the less technical are
Robert Frank’s paper speculating on children’s progress toward increasing syntactic
complexity during language acquisition (Chapter 3), which is moderately interesting
but does not go much beyond the suggestion that comparing acquisition time and
processing load for various constructions might be a good idea, and the paper by
Beth Ann Hockey and Heather Mateyak on the semantic features that influence the
sequencing of determiners in English (Chapter 9), which does not make much essential
use of TAGs. But others are highly (even indigestibly) technical studies of various
theoretical modifications of or alternatives to TAGs (e.g., Gisela Pitsch’s comparison
of TAGs with hyperedge replacement grammars, Chapter 7). Most of the examinations
of parsing and implementation issues (Chapters 13–19) are fairly demanding.
This is a valuable book, and I am glad to have it. But it is my duty as reviewer to
express a small grumble about it. This book is not a credit to the editorial profession.
The bibliographies to the chapters (some 30 pages altogether) are not harmonized in
style (e.g., with respect to capitalization) and are not collated at the end of the book
(which makes for some wasteful duplication). The index is simply unacceptable: it
will not enable scholars to find in this book the things they are looking for. And the
text contains many misprints and formatting errors. I noted: “probelm” for “problem”
(page 51); “explicitely” for “explicitly” (page 147); “theXP” for “the XP” (page 169);
“connectivesor” for “connectives or” and “markerscan” for “markers can” (page 249);
“alors .” for “alors.” (page 253); “bindingpossibilities” for “binding possibilities.” (page
283); “analysisas such” for “analysis as such” and several other such errors (page 284,
bottom); “gapsare” for “gaps are” and several other such errors (page 298, bottom);
“slowliness” for “slowness” (page 324); “asemantic graph ? an answer” for “a semantic
graph? An answer” (page 324); “Gazdar, G. G.” for “Gazdar, G.” (page 471); and so
on (this list is not exhaustive).
There are typos in most books, of course; accurate proofreading is an arduous job.
But this book falls below what might reasonably be expected. To see an extraneous
paragraph break caused when LaTEX hit a double line break in the source file (see page
77) suggests that some parts of the book were hardly even looked at in final form, let
alone proofread with care, by either the editors or the publisher’s staff.
If books are going to be produced via ready-to-run LaTEX files, and volume editors
do not take their jobs seriously, it bodes ill for the future of books. LaTEX makes beautiful

editors and compositors and proofreaders still have to be done (the production of this
journal by The MIT Press still involves a copy editor, a proofreader, and an expert
LaTEX wrangler over and above the editors). I am sorry to say that the editors of this
generally interesting and useful book have let their readers down.

Marcu’s monograph is based on his Ph.D. thesis—research carried out at the Depart-
ment of Computer Science, University of Toronto—and subsequent work conducted at
the Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California. It argues for the
idea that discourse/rhetorical relations that connect text spans of various length can
be computed without a complete semantic analysis of sentences that make up these
text segments. As an alternative, a formal specification of admissible text structures is
provided, which constrains the range of possible semantic and functional connections
between text spans and imposes strict well-formedness conditions on valid discourse
structures. For effectively computing these text structures, mainly surface-oriented
lexical cues and shallow text-parsing techniques are used. Complementary to these
formal and computational considerations, Marcu reports on various evaluations, both
intrinsic and extrinsic, in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of his ap-
proach and the generality of the principles it is based on. These experiments were
mostly carried out on Scientific American, TREC, MUC, Wall Street Journal, and Brown
corpora.
The book consists of three main parts. In the first part, linguistic and formal prop-
erties of coherent texts are discussed, with a focus on high-level discourse structures.
This theoretical framework serves, in the second part, as the background for devel-
oping discourse structure parsing algorithms that compute rhetorical relations in real-
world free texts. The benefits of such algorithms for building a high-performance text
summarization system are dealt with in the third part.
In the first part, the author factors out a set of assumptions that are common to
prominent approaches to discourse structure. So, consensus has been reached that texts
can be segmented into nonoverlapping, elementary textual units, that discourse rela-
tions of different types link (elementary and complex) textual units of various sizes,
that some textual units are more important to the writer’s communicative intentions
and goals than others, and that trees are a good approximation of the abstract structure
of most texts. These considerations lead to a compositionality criterion that requires
that discourse relations that link two large text spans can be explained by discourse
relations that hold between at least two of the most salient text units of the con-
stituent spans. This notion then forms the basis for a first-order logic axiomatization
that captures formal properties of valid text structures. Although this formalization is
independent of the set of rhetorical relations actually considered, it yields, by proper
relation instantiation, a formal characterization of the structural properties that are
specific to Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1988). Building
on these formal considerations, the author discusses three (nonincremental) algorith-
mic paradigms that compute some or all valid discourse structures of a text. Two
of them employ model-theoretic techniques and encode the problem of text-structure

derivation as a classical constraint satisfaction problem and as a propositional satis-
fiability problem. The other one is grammar-based and builds on a proof theory for
solving the text-structure derivation problem (demonstrated to be sound and complete
with respect to the given logical formalization). The performance of these algorithms
is compared empirically on a benchmark of eight manually encoded text-structure
derivation problems.
Marcu uses logic to distinguish between discourse structures that are valid and
those that are not, so that all valid discourse structures of a text can be determined.
In the second part of the monograph, attention then shifts to alternative approaches
to deriving valid discourse structures. The first approach relies primarily on discourse
markers for shallow rhetorical parsing and employs, as a result of an in-depth corpus
analysis, manually designed rules covering more than 450 English cue phrases such as
because, however, and in addition, as well as punctuation marks. The second approach
adds to plain discourse markers knowledge of surface-oriented lexical co-occurrence
data, syntactic criteria (such as part-of-speech categories), and lexical similarity mea-
sures based on semantic relation information in order to identify text segments and
their rhetorical organization. Given this knowledge-richer setting, discourse parsing
rules were automatically derived by applying machine learning techniques (the C4.5
decision-tree algorithm) to data obtained from three corpora of manually annotated
discourse trees. All these approaches are meticulously and lucidly described by pro-
viding various algorithm schemata for relevant computation steps. Empirical studies
are then concerned with the role that discourse markers play in properly segmenting
texts into elementary text units and in signaling rhetorical relations that hold between
the text segments they connect. The correctness of the discourse trees built by the
parser is judged intrinsically, by comparing automatically derived trees with ones that
have been built manually, as well as extrinsically, by evaluating the impact automat-
ically derived discourse trees have on properly solving natural language processing
problems such as the summarization of texts.
In the third part of the book, the utility of computing discourse structures is em-
pirically assessed in the context of such a text summarization (i.e., extraction) task.
The approach advocated by Marcu is readily applicable to this problem, since the
representation structures it yields offer implicit content salience orderings in terms
of the hierarchical tree structure and the distinction of important information con-
tained in the nucleus and less-important information contained in the satellite portion
of text spans, all of which are of immediate relevance for summarization purposes.
The main hypothesis to be confirmed is whether or not discourse structures can be
successfully exploited in a practical summarization setting. In a methodological exper-
iment, evidence is gathered that text structures such as those mentioned above indeed
effectively contribute to identifying the most important units of a text. A discourse-
structure-based summarization algorithm that builds on these principles implements
a simple salience metric that interprets the tree structure generated by the simple
cue-phrase-based text-structure parser. A comparative evaluation reveals that this ap-
proach significantly outperforms two baseline algorithms (lead sentence and random
sentence selection) and Microsoft’s Office 97 summarizer. Considering the structure
of discourse to be the paramount factor in determining salience, and incorporating
a variety of additional position-, title-, text-tree-, and lexically-based summarization
heuristics, a simple GSAT-style learning mechanism is presented that optimizes a lin-
ear combination of seven single salience metrics (in terms of combined recall and
precision). This way, a significant increase in the performance of the discourse-based
summarizer is achieved (yet parameter tuning is clearly dependent on the given text
genre and compression rate!).

Marcu’s monograph presents a cornerstone in the computational treatment of texts.
It has formal merits, as it provides a model-theoretic framework for the study of text
coherence structures, in general, and the study of RST, in particular. It has compu-
tational merits, as it provides alternative ways of deriving text-structure descriptions
automatically and inexpensively (i.e., avoiding full, in-depth text understanding) and
distinguishes, given the a priori axiomatization, valid text structures from invalid ones.
It has methodological merits, as it incorporates machine learning techniques for au-
tomatically acquiring the rules needed for discourse parsing and discourse-structure-
driven summarization. Finally, it has empirical merits, as algorithms are tested and
validated under different experimental conditions.
Marcu also frankly admits that his work ignores the wealth of linguistic constructs
that have been shown to be important in text understanding. Such phenomena include
focus, topicality, cohesion and reference, pragmatics, and so on. Hence, the notion
of validity being proposed is a constrained one, and it has to be weighed carefully
against the notion of adequacy and expressiveness of the representation structures
derivable therefrom. Still, the author claims that these phenomena can be couched
in his formal framework as well. Additionally, one might mention the crucial role
of domain-knowledge-dependent inferences and their interaction with building text
structures in the absence of explicit cue phrases. Further open issues are the granularity
of the text units that span rhetorical relations (e.g., the phrasal as opposed to the clausal
or “clause-like” level) and the impact of the text genres under scrutiny. Finally, the
dependence on basic assumptions and constructs underlying RST, despite the author’s
attempt to abstract away from it as much as possible, might be more prevalent than
is acknowledged.
The book spans a wide variety of issues in a well-structured, reader-friendly way,
and it is easy to understand even in its technical passages. Hence, it can be highly
recommended for graduate courses on text analysis. Students are given an outstanding
example of the current research paradigm of computational linguistics, which includes
formal, algorithmic, methodological, and empirical contributions. And they also may
learn how scientific results can be communicated in a rigorous though comprehensible
manner.

This is a large volume, and it contains multitudes. Semantics is construed in a broad
sense as the study of how meaning is communicated through the medium of language
in a social context, taking account of inferences the hearer is expected to make on the
basis of such factors as linguistic knowledge per se, context and “co-text,” encyclopedic
knowledge, conventions of politeness and cooperative behavior, and the relative social
status of speaker and hearer. The book ranges over a variety of approaches that have
addressed these issues, including philosophy of language, lexicography, formal (logic-
based) and cognitive semantics, frame-based knowledge representation, pragmatics,
and anthropology. However, the result is more than a catalogue of theoretical tools
and frameworks; throughout the book, Allan keeps in view an underlying philosophy
that “meaning is cognitively and functionally motivated.”
Chapters 1 and 2 introduce fundamental notions such as sense and reference,
extension and intension, compositionality, and speech acts. Chapters 3–5 deal with
aspects of lexical semantics: Chapter 3 concerns the structure and content of lexical en-
tries, Chapter 4 investigates the extent to which individual morphemes can be assigned
semantic interpretations, and Chapter 5 contains an illuminating discussion of aspects
of nonliteral word meaning such as connotation, euphemism, dysphemism, and jar-
gon. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the formal apparatus of propositional and predicate
logic and the lambda calculus, and discuss notions of consequence such as semantic
entailment and conversational and conventional implicatures. Chapters 8–10 are con-
cerned with “cognitive and functional approaches to semantics,” that is, approaches
whose theoretical constructs are claimed to have some form of “psychological reality”
or are motivated in terms of their “communicative functions.” These chapters review
topics such as frames and scripts, componential analysis, classifiers, color categories
across languages, prototypes, and stereotypes. Chapters 11–13 address various issues
in clausal and nominal semantics. Chapter 11 concerns modality, tense, and thematic
roles, whereas Chapter 12 discusses different approaches to the semantics of verbs and
other predicates. Chapter 13 grapples with some of the intricacies of quantification,
number, and countability in English noun phrases, using generalized quantifier theory
and a variant of ensemble theory. As far as I know, this is the first published tutorial
account of the latter, which has previously only been accessible to students in Harry
Bunt’s rather challenging monograph (1985). We are told that Chapters 11–13 “demon-
strate the application of formal methods of semantic analysis to a corpus of data.” This
section is likely to disappoint computational linguists, who will understand the term
corpus in a different way, since the data in these chapters consist of a series of single-
sentence (and mostly single-clause) examples apparently constructed by the author.

The author is clearly in sympathy with the cognitive semantics school, which
claims to uncover “psychologically real” structures and processes involved in lan-
guage use. It’s not always clear to me from Allan’s account what the various claims
for psychological reality amount to (such as that for “linguistic categories, semantic
fields, frames and the like,” page 288). The methodology displayed tends to follow the
standard practice of linguistics textbooks in postulating abstract analyses of examples
constructed by the analyst, the reader being invited to share the analyst’s intuitions
about their acceptability and interpretation; there is little appeal to experimental or
neurological evidence, for example. There are some fascinating discussions of vari-
ous senses of words such as back (pages 289ff.) and over (pages 330–331), extended
from their basic senses that are presumed to be rooted in direct physical perception.
However, these do not give rise to productive procedures that could reliably generate
extended senses for equivalent words in other languages, for instance, or other words
denoting physical relations or body parts. An attempt to map out some common
ground between the cognitive and formal approaches is far from convincing (pages
288–289, emphasis added):
(First premise) Formal representations are created by human minds
and are interpretable by human minds. Therefore, they have cognitive
reality ...
(Second premise) The informal metalanguages of the cognitivists ...
are creations of deliberate, consciously contrived artifice, just as much
as any formal metalanguages are.
(Conclusion) Formalists, cognitivists and functionalists all use con-
trived metalanguages that have cognitive reality.
As an introduction to formal semantics, this book does not supersede established
classics such as Gamut (1991). Definitions are sometimes unsatisfactory, effectively
substituting one imprecise term for another, as when Grice’s (1975) conventional im-
plicature (CI) is defined as “implies ... but does not entail” (page 189). The examples of
CI that are offered include these: all gold implies that the ensemble of gold is nonempty
(page 437) and four eggs implies at least two eggs (page 189). But these are surely different
phenomena, the former being a defeasible convention and the latter an arithmetical
consequence of the meanings of four and two. Likewise, in the chapter on quantifiers,
few students is glossed as “very-much-less than” all contextually relevant students (page
433), though how much less counts as “very-much-less than” itself depends on context
and assumptions about prior expectations (Moxey and Sanford 1993).
Every computational linguist should own at least one semantics textbook. Allan’s
book stands apart from many other texts in the way it conveys a real sense of the
variety and fecundity of language as spoken by living, breathing human beings, rather
than as a source of intriguing logicophilosophical puzzles. Nonspecialists will certainly
find it an informative, albeit uneven, conspectus of paradigms and areas of inquiry in
linguistic semantics, with the bonus that it is actually fun to read.

The study of intonation is an expanding field, extending beyond core linguistic disci-
plines such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics into areas as wide-ranging as psy-
cholinguistics, neurolinguistics, discourse analysis, and emotion research. Intonation is
also currently the prime focus of attention in speech synthesis research and is rapidly
gaining ground in speech recognition. This expansion has been reflected in a number
of workshops and conferences devoted solely to intonation and its interfaces, one of
which was the ESCA Workshop on Intonation in Athens in September 1997. The vol-
ume reviewed here is one of two collections of papers based on contributions to this
workshop. The other collection has appeared as a special issue of Speech Communication
(33(4), March 2001).
The book consists of four main sections—Prominence and Focus, Boundaries and
Discourse, Intonation Modelling, and Intonation Technology—along with an introduc-
tion (Antonis Botinis) and a historical overview (Mario Rossi). In this review, I shall
concentrate on papers that relate intonation to semantic, pragmatic, or discourse func-
tions and leave the papers dealing solely with speech or phonetics for a review in a
journal specializing in those areas.
In the Prominence and Focus section, Julia Hirschberg and Cinzia Avesani’s pa-
per, “Prosodic Disambiguation in English and Italian,” investigates to what degree
speakers of English and Italian use intonational means to disambiguate semantically
and syntactically ambiguous sentences. The authors found that, with the exception of
quantifier scope, semantic ambiguities were generally more clearly disambiguated than
syntactic ones. This was true for both languages. Regarding the semantic ambiguities,
the two languages had similar strategies: the scope of negation was disambiguated by
phrasing, and the differences in scope of focus-sensitive operators were distinguished
by means of pitch accent placement. The authors note that although speakers were
aware of the distinctions, they often produced a neutral rendition that would be fe-
licitous for either interpretation, presumably because they read the tokens within a
context that already resolved the ambiguity. We learn from this that although context
is necessary for eliciting the correct reading, it may at the same time dispense with
the reason to disambiguate.
In the Boundaries and Discourse section, all three papers have something to offer
for readers of Computational Linguistics. Vincent van Heuven and Judith Haan’s “Pho-
netic Correlates of Statement versus Question Intonation in Dutch” is based on both

production and perception experiments. The authors show that although questions as
a category have a number of acoustic properties that clearly distinguish them from
statements, each question type has a distinct profile of its own in terms of F0 (fun-
damental frequency, the perceptual correlate of which is pitch). These question types
are wh-questions (lexical and syntactic marking), yes-no questions (which in Dutch are
marked syntactically), and declarative questions (syntactically indistinguishable from
statements). One major cue for the perception of questions is a sentence-final rise in
pitch that was never found in statements. The smaller the number of lexicosyntactic
indicators as to interrogativity, the higher the rise in pitch and the greater the inci-
dence of such a rise. Other cues include the pitch range, height, and overall shape
(e.g., downward or upward trends) across the whole sentence.
Monique van Donzel and Florien Koopmans-van Beinum’s “Pitch Movements and
Information Structure in Spontaneous Dutch Discourse” confirms previous findings
that new information is more often accented than inferrable information. The au-
thors establish the following hierarchy of accentability: new information &gt; inferrable
information &gt; verbs &gt; modifiers &gt; discourse markers and evoked information. Dis-
course boundaries, assigned on the basis of a discourse model developed by the au-
thors in earlier work, are realized with rising pitch (labeled as nonfinal by naive lis-
teners) more often than previously reported. The authors also show that pitch height
depends on neither newness nor the type of discourse boundary. Speakers varied a
great deal with regard to how often they marked discourse boundaries with pitch
variation as opposed to, say, pausing. However, despite these realizational differences,
naive listeners perceived prominences and boundaries to a comparable extent across
speakers, indicating that they are flexible enough to adapt their perceptual criteria to
the current speaker.
Anne Wichman, Jill House, and Toni Rietveld’s “Discourse Constraints on F0 Peak
Timing in English” is a double study of Southern Standard British English, using
natural uncontrolled data and a carefully designed corpus of read paragraphs. The
timing of F0 peaks is shown to be dependent on where the accent falls within a
discourse unit: peaks were later in paragraph-initial position (equivalent in this study
to discourse-topic-initial position) than in paragraph-internal position, and sentence-
initial accents were in turn later than sentence-final ones. The authors conclude that
topic-initiality exerts a strong rightward push on F0 peaks, even causing them to occur
outside the accented syllable. Predictably, discourse structure is also found to affect F0
peak height, topic-initiality leading to higher peaks than topic-mediality.
In the Intonation and Technology section, G¨osta Bruce, Marcus Filipson, Johan
Frid, Bj¨orn Granstr¨om, Kjell Gustafson, Merle Horne, and David House’s “Modelling
of Swedish Text and Discourse Intonation in a Speech Synthesis Framework” provides
an overview of an intonation model that was originally based on single-utterance labo-
ratory speech. The model has now been extended to cover dialogues and multispeaker
conversations, incorporating information on lexical semantics and discourse and tex-
tual structure. An important step in the research program is model-based resynthesis,
whereby a synthetic F0 contour is superimposed on the original utterance. The F0
values for resynthesis are calculated on the basis of the symbolic utterance-level rep-
resentation (pitch accents and boundary tones only) of the original. The differences
between calculated and original F0 values, such as overall trends and shifts up and
down in F0 range and height, are related to the analysis of the text in order to extract
parameter values that can be fed into the text-to-speech implementation.
It is clear that this volume is aimed at readers who already have a basic knowl-
edge of intonation and know what they are looking for. Since most of the chapters
deal with highly specialized topics, each one is likely to be read in isolation. However,

As the editors of this volume remind us, polysemy has been a vexing issue for the
understanding of language since antiquity.1 For half a century, it has been a major
bottleneck for natural language processing. It contributed to the failure of early ma-
chine translation research (remember Bar-Hillel’s famous pen and box example) and is
still plaguing most natural language processing and information retrieval applications.
A recent issue of this journal described the state of the art in automatic sense disam-
biguation (Ide and V´eronis 1998), and Senseval system competitions have revealed the
immense difficulty of the task (http://www.sle.sharp.co.uk/senseval2). However, no
significant progress can be made on the computational aspects of polysemy without
serious advances in theoretical issues. At the same time, theoretical work can be fos-
tered by computational results and problems, and language-processing applications
can provide a unique test bed for theories. It was therefore an excellent idea to gather
both theoretical and applied contributions in the same book.
Yael Ravin and Claudia Leacock are well-known names to those who work on the
theoretical and computational aspects of word meaning. In this volume, they bring
together a collection of essays from leading researchers in the field. As far as I can tell,
these essays are not reprints or expanded versions of conference papers, as is often
the case for edited works; instead, they seem to have been specially commissioned for
the purposes of this book, which makes it even more exciting to examine.
The book is composed of 11 chapters. It is not formally divided into parts, but
chapters dealing more specifically with the computational aspects of polysemy are
grouped together at the end (and constitute about one-third of the volume).
Chapter 1 is an overview written by the volume editors. Yael Ravin and Clau-
dia Leacock survey the main theories of meaning and their treatment of polysemy.
These include the classical Aristotelian approach revived by Katz and Fodor (1963);
Rosch’s (1977) prototypical approach, which has its roots in Wittgenstein’s Philosophi-
cal Investigations (1953); and the relational approach recently exemplified by WordNet
(Fellbaum 1998), which (although the authors do not mention it) can be traced back
to Peirce’s (1931–1958) and Selz’s (1913, 1922) graphs and which gained popularity
with Quillian’s (1968) semantic networks. In the course of this overview, Ravin and
Leacock put the individual chapters into perspective by relating them to the various
theories.

In Chapter 2, “Aspects of the Micro-Structure of Word Meanings,” D. Alan Cruse
addresses the issue of the extreme context-sensitivity of word meaning, which can
result in an almost infinite subdivision of senses. However, Cruse believes that there
are “regions of higher semantic density” within this extreme variability, which he calls
sense-nodules, “lumps of meaning with greater or lesser stability under contextual
change.” As Cruse admits, this is only a metaphor, and as such, may not be highly
useful to the researcher. In the rest of the chapter, Cruse attempts to build a typology
of these nodules, listing their properties and providing tests to detect them. The tests
(e.g., the zeugma effect in sentences such as John and his driving license expired yesterday)
are not entirely new (e.g., Quine 1960; Cruse 1986; Geeraerts 1993), but are integrated
here into a coherent framework that places context-dependency at the very heart of
the theory.
Chapter 3 by Christiane Fellbaum is devoted to “autotroponymy.” This term re-
quires a two-step explanation. Troponyms are verb hyponyms, referring to specific
manners of performing actions denoted by other verbs. For example, in English, stam-
mer, babble, whisper, and shout are troponyms of talking. Autotroponymy is a special case
that occurs when the verbs linked by this relation share the same form, as in The
children behaved /The children behaved well. The author explains autotroponymy in terms
of conflation of a meaning component not expressed on the surface. For example, in
The children behaved, the verb includes a hidden adverbial (well /satisfactorily/appropri-
ately). Fellbaum gives a typology of autotroponyms that is based on the nature of the
conflated element (noun, adjective, adverbial), and she discusses their syntactic and
semantic properties in detail.
In Chapter 4, “Lexical Shadowing and Argument Closure,” James Pustejovsky
explores verbs such as butter, which block the expression of a generic argument, as in
*Mary buttered her bread with butter, while allowing for a specific one, as in Mary buttered
her bread with expensive butter from Wisconsin (see Levin 1993), and verbs such as risk,
which can occur in contradictory contexts with roughly the same meaning, as in Mary
risked death to save her son /Mary risked her life to save her son (see Fillmore and Atkins 1995).
Pustejovsky introduces the concept of “lexical shadowing,” which he defines as “the
relation between an argument and the underlying semantic expression, which blocks
its syntactic projection in the syntax.” For example, the underlying semantics of the
verb butter “shadows” the expression of the substance that is spread and allows only
for specialization of the shadowed argument. For verbs such as risk, the shadowing is
of a different type: it is the expression of one argument that shadows the expression
of another, in a strictly complementary fashion. Pustejovsky explains these cases of
argument optionality or complementarity in the framework of the Generative Lexicon
(Pustejovsky 1995) and its various devices, among which “coercion” plays a central
role.
Chapter 5, by Charles Fillmore and Sue Atkins, is a case study in lexicography.
They analyze the sense divisions and definitions of the verb crawl in various dictio-
naries and compare them with corpus evidence from the British National Corpus. It
is well known that dictionaries exhibit large discrepancies, and although they claim
to be based on the analysis of corpus data, many sense distinctions that show up in
a corpus are not reflected in dictionary entries. This is not entirely unexpected, since
after all, no dictionary claims exhaustive coverage of a language, and some selection
must be made by the lexicographer. This is even an explicit goal in four of the six
dictionaries examined here, which are learners’ dictionaries that attempt to illustrate
the “core” uses of words for learners of English. It is striking, however, to see the
extent to which lexicographers differ regarding their choices and assessment of what
constitutes an important meaning a learner should acquire. Fillmore and Atkins are

perfectly right in noting that lexicographers lack objective criteria for sense division
and information extraction from corpora. The FrameNet project they describe in an
appendix (see http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/framenet/) is an attempt to achieve a
systematic understanding and description of the meanings of lexical items and gram-
matical constructions by looking at a large number of attested examples, sorting them
according to the conceptual structures (semantic “frames”) that underlie their mean-
ings, and describing the associated information in terms of semantic roles, phrase
types, and grammatical functions. The numerous observations regarding sense con-
nections in the corpus examples result in a network-like organization of meanings,
which can be used in both monolingual and bilingual lexicography. The last section
of the chapter illustrates this possibility using the verb ramper, the French equivalent
of to crawl.
Chapter 6, “‘The Garden Swarms with Bees’ and the Fallacy of ‘Argument Alter-
nation’” by David Dowty, comes back to the argument problem already tackled by
Fellbaum and Pustejovsky in their respective chapters and proposes syntactic struc-
tures as an explanatory principle for alternations in meaning. The author is concerned
with agent / location alternations such as Bees swarm in the garden / The garden swarms
with bees. He departs from the usual point of view that such pairs express the same
meaning and differ only in syntactic form. Using the large set of examples in Salkoff
(1983), Dowty groups verbs that participate in such alternations into five semantic
classes and then shows that the two forms exhibit many semantic differences related
to the informational structure of the sentence. The locative-subject form makes the
location the topic of discourse, with the predicate ascribing an abstract property to
the location. Some tests show the difference in meaning. For example, the with-phrase
object must be semantically “unquantified” in the locative-subject form (compare A
roach crawled on the wall / *The wall crawled with a roach), the locative-subject form is more
suited to metaphor than the agent-subject form, and so forth.
Chapter 7 by Cliff Goddard outlines Wierzbicka’s “natural semantic metalan-
guage” (NSM) approach to semantic analysis (Wierzbicka 1996, etc.), which is based
on the idea that every language possesses a core of undefinable words (“semantic
primes”). Complex expressions (words or grammatical constructions) can be described
by means of explanatory reductive paraphrases composed of combinations of seman-
tic primes. This “definitional” framework provides a diagnosis technique for detecting
polysemy. For any given word, one can first assume that it has a single meaning and
try to state it in a reductive paraphrase. If this turns out to be impossible and sev-
eral paraphrases are needed to describe the word’s range of uses, then the word has
distinct meanings. For example, there is no single paraphrase in terms of primes that
could predict the range of uses of the French word fille, meaning both daughter and
girl, and therefore the word must be split into two distinct meanings. Using this test,
Goddard shows that dictionaries very often posit false and unnecessary polysemy,
and occasionally false monosemy. He also shows how the technique can be used on
grammatical constructions, and he applies it in detail to have a VP expressions (have a
stroll, have a chat, etc.). The chapter ends with a discussion of how aspects of figurative
language can be handled within this framework.
In Chapter 8, “Lexical Representations for Sentence Processing,” George Miller and
Claudia Leacock raise the following question: “Why isn’t a dictionary a good theory
of the lexical component of language?” They share Fillmore and Atkins’s dissatisfac-
tion about dictionary making. For them, the main shortcoming of dictionaries is their
lack of contextual information that would enable a user to make the correct association
between senses and actual contexts. In their introduction, they give a convincing exam-
ple from previous experiments. Schoolchildren given dictionary definitions of English

words produced sentences such as Our family erodes a lot, which sounds bizarre until
you read the definition of erode: ‘eat out, eat away’. According to Miller and Leacock,
what is missing from dictionaries is a satisfactory treatment of the lexical aspects of
sentence processing. The rest of the chapter is devoted to a discussion of the two
types of context that can be used to associate a given context with a particular word
sense: local context (the immediate neighbors of the word under focus) and topical
context (the general topic or domain of the text or conversation). The authors show
that local context cues are very precise when they occur, but often simply do not occur.
On the other hand, topical context is very efficient in helping discriminate between
homographs, but not very helpful for identifying the different senses of a polysemous
word. Miller and Leacock consider the combination of the two sources to be a major
avenue of research.
Mark Stevenson and Yorick Wilks tackle this issue in Chapter 9, “Large Vocab-
ulary Word Sense Disambiguation,” in which they propose a methodology for com-
bining several knowledge sources into a word sense disambiguation system. Their
first source of information is syntactic in nature and is provided by the Brill part-
of-speech tagger. The semantic information present in the local context is then used
in two ways. The overlap between Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English defini-
tions and the local context is computed by means of an improved version of Cowie,
Guthrie, and Guthrie’s (1992) simulated-annealing technique, and selectional restric-
tions are resolved by means of LDOCE semantic classes. The larger context is handled
with techniques that map it to the subject categories provided by LDOCE for each
sense (“pragmatic codes”). The efficiency of each of these modules taken separately
ranges from 44 to 79 percent, but Stevenson and Wilks show that using machine
learning techniques, the modules can be combined in an efficient way to produce 90
percent correct disambiguation, which is quite high for an unrestricted vocabulary
system.
In Chapter 10, “Polysemy in a Broad-Coverage Natural Language Processing Sys-
tem,” William Dolan, Lucy Vanderwende, and Steven Richardson describe the ap-
proach to polysemy processing taken in the MS-NLP broad-coverage natural language
understanding system. The core of their system is MindNet, a network-structured com-
putational lexicon extracted from machine-readable dictionaries (MRD) augmented
with corpus information. MindNet uses the same general approach as the MRD-based
spreading activation networks proposed by V´eronis and Ide (1990), although in a much
more sophisticated version including labeled connections, backward links, weighted
paths, and so on. The authors depart from most computational approaches to polysemy
in that they believe that word meaning is “inherently flexible,” that making predefined
inventories of discrete senses is unsuitable for broad-coverage applications, and that
no sharp boundaries should be drawn between senses. Their approach is reminiscent
of Cruse’s, presented earlier in this book. For these authors, “understanding” is no
more than identifying an activation pattern in the network.
In previous publications, Hinrich Sch¨utze held a position similar to Dolan, Van-
dervende, and Richardson’s with respect to predefined sense inventories. For Sch¨utze,
many problems require discrimination among senses but do not require explicit sense
labeling, and the techniques he has proposed extract the sense divisions from the cor-
pus itself (see Sch¨utze 1998): a sense is a group of contextually similar occurrences of
a word. This approach is almost the opposite of Goddard’s. In Chapter 11, Sch¨utze
looks at word sense disambiguation from the perspective of connectionism. After sur-
veying some of the literature on disambiguation, he presents an algorithm that has
grown out of two major concerns in connectionist research: psychological plausibil-
ity and large-scale applicability. He describes an application to information retrieval

that demonstrates that his algorithm can be applied to very large text collections (500
megabytes of text from the Wall Street Journal).
The most noticeable feature of this book is probably its wide range of contributors
and the broad scope of the topics it encompasses. As the title implies, it addresses
both theoretical and computational aspects of polysemy, and within these two areas,
very different research trends are pursued. The book gives a very good overall picture
of current issues in polysemy and of the diverse ways of approaching the topic. It
should therefore hold an important place on the shelves of any researcher in the fields
of lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation, and will certainly be valued by
many of our graduate students.
The wide-angle snapshot offered by this book also reveals a very striking fact
about current lexical semantics. Apart from one chapter, all theoretical discussions are
supported solely by invented examples. Lexical semantics, and probably semantics
in general, has not yet made the paradigm shift that has occurred or is occurring in
other branches of linguistics, such as syntax, where empirical evidence now replaces
intuition as the normal body of data to be studied. Another recent book (Sampson
2001) quite brilliantly shows how the lack of objective evidence has been misleading
linguistic research for decades and has placed the discipline on the fringe of modern
science. The lack of objective evidence is probably even more dangerous in semantics
than in other areas of linguistics. The extreme flimsiness of introspection-based tests is
acknowledged by lexical semanticists themselves—for instance, how much agreement
would there be on whether or not a given coordination is a zeugma?—and such tests
make it almost impossible for semantics to satisfy the minimal requirement that science
has demanded since Karl Popper, that of refutability.
Interestingly enough, the one chapter that does use corpus examples (Chapter
5 by Fillmore and Atkins) pertains to lexicography. Lexicographers indeed have a
long tradition of examining objective evidence, which computer tools and electronic
corpora have made it possible to systematize. However, several chapters (Chapter 5
by Fillmore and Atkins, Chapter 7 by Goddard, Chapter 8 by Miller and Leacock)
express their dissatisfaction with current dictionaries, on the grounds that they lack
theoretical criteria to back their organization. It is also worth noting that the only
computational approaches to word sense disambiguation able to claim some minimal
degree of efficiency are linguistically blind ones (like those reported in this book), as
if an insurmountable gap existed between theories and applications. A paradigm shift
in lexical semantics is therefore not just a scientific necessity; it is also a practical one.
I am convinced that no major breakthrough in language-processing applications and
lexicography can be made until theories of meaning are based on the observation of
real data.

The problem of pragmatics arises as soon as we move beyond the linguistic analysis
of an utterance and ask what the speaker meant by it. Now, speaker’s meaning is a
particular case of intention, and all intentions are complex mental attitudes that tie an
agent’s actions to its goals, its background beliefs, and its appraisal of the context in
which it acts. Inferring the speaker’s meaning, then, is a matter of recognizing how
the speaker might have represented the utterance as linking up with the current dis-
course context and thereby furthering the goals of the conversation. This recognition
of intention is reasoning to the best explanation, or abductive reasoning, as popu-
larized in computational linguistics by Hobbs and colleagues (1993). So there they
are: abduction, belief, and context—Harry Bunt and William Black’s ABC of computa-
tional pragmatics—three concepts that rightly frame the diversity of current research
in problems of pragmatic interpretation.
In this volume (ABC for short), Bunt and Black collect 15 chapters that grow, by
and large, out of the ESPRIT project PLUS (Pragmatics-Based Language Understanding
System). This coherence lends the volume strengths not often found in collections of
research papers; ABC fits together to give a broad picture of computational pragmatics
as an interdisciplinary enterprise in which a multitude of different investigations can
be brought to bear constructively on a common project.
To start, ABC offers generally consistent terminology and perspective, laid out in
a 150-page three-chapter overview of computational pragmatics in PLUS. As outlined
by Bunt and Black in Chapter 1, dialogue system design in PLUS centered on the
representations and inference required for recognizing the communicative intentions
behind users’ utterances. Jens Allwood’s Communicative Activity Analysis (Chapter 2)
provided the theoretical framework for this design, while Bunt’s Dynamic Interpre-
tation Theory (Chapter 3) bridged this dialogue theory and specialized models of
meaning and context from computational linguistics and from computer science more
generally.
Concretely, this approach is distinguished by a wide view of context, including
social and physical dimensions as well as linguistic ones, and a wide view of agency,
mandating considerations of ethics and trust in cooperation from the start. It is also
guided by some more practical working assumptions:

<listItem confidence="0.757058666666667">
• a focus on dialogues of information exchange in which domain
reasoning (particularly reasoning about users’ domain plans and

• an emphasis on the conventionality of moves in dialogue, against
indirect speech acts and other particularized conversational implicatures;
• an eclectic use of mathematical tools for describing information states in
dialogue—from computational logic, knowledge representation, and
deductive databases as well as computational linguistics.
ABC also benefits from its coherence in achieving impressive coverage with mini-
mal redundancy. In addition to the introductory material, chapters cover general prob-
lems in implementing interactive dialogue systems: context representation (Bunt), user
modeling (Meyer), and architectures for system design (Sabah; Taylor and Waugh).
Other chapters cover more specifically linguistic aspects of computational pragmatics:
attention tracking (Carter), discourse structure (Redeker), and speech acts (Ramsay;
Beun; Thijsse). Finally, connecting problems in computational linguistics and inter-
action are chapters on inference for dialogue understanding and generation, united
by the theme of abduction (Neal): abductive generation (Oberlander and Lascarides),
abductive context updating (Guessoum and Gallagher), and abductive interpretation
(Hinkelman and Spackman). The chapters also illustrate a wide range of method-
ology, including not only the ubiquitous formal modeling but also corpus analysis
(Redeker), Wizard-of-Oz studies (Beun), system building (Hinkelman and Spackman),
and evaluation (Carter).
The coherence of ABC has the unfortunate side effect of offering little comparison
with other ongoing work in computational pragmatics beyond the projects the book
documents. ABC’s assumptions about dialogue are in fact rather controversial. Is in-
formation exchange simple? Research on cooperative response has made information
exchange the classic test bed for modeling domain problem-solving and its ramifi-
cations for dialogue. Once a user makes clear his intention to do something with the
information he gets, you may have a full task-oriented dialogue with all the struc-
ture and communicative action that entails. Can dialogue moves be purely conven-
tional in a robust system? Or are disagreements, misconceptions, accommodation,
even jokes, so common and so rich that a first-principles representation of commu-
nicative intention along Gricean lines cannot be avoided? And where are we to push
for representations of context: database theory or models of uncertainty? With more
and better comparison to alternative models, ABC would have done much better at
conveying the difficulty, vitality, and diversity of research in computational pragmat-
ics.
Even if ABC is hardly a source for all the latest ideas in dialogue,1 ultimately,
as always, it is the field itself that will make lasting comparisons. With its broad,
consistent tutorial flavor, ABC deserves a place right behind Cohen, Morgan, and
Pollack’s Intentions in Communication (1990) as an accessible introduction to some classic
ideas in the computational analysis of conversation.

This book is not for linguists. This book is not for computer scientists. This book is
for undergraduate librarians.
Given the promising title, from which one might expect a comprehensive look at
imposing order on knowledge, this is a little disappointing. The back-cover blurb in-
sists that the book can be used to provide “guidance for relational tasks [that are] now
taking on greater significance, as retrieval systems increasingly operate in automated
modes and as retrieval systems cross linguistic, cultural, and disciplinary boundaries.”
But going inside, one enters the closed-world community of library science for which
the automation of the card catalogue is still big news.
The book is disappointing because so many strands of modern computational and
linguistic work attacking the problem of organizing knowledge are missing. For exam-
ple, from computer science, the fact that relationships have formed the core of database
modeling ever since relational databases (Codd 1970) and the entity-relationship model
(Chen 1976) goes unacclaimed. From artificial intelligence, missing is any of the work
on ontologies for organizing knowledge, such as Penman’s upper model (Bateman et
al. 1990) and CYC (Lenat et al. 1990), and work on organizing knowledge in expert
systems. As for linguistics, there is no mention of the strain of research stemming
from the idea of semantic markers (Katz and Fodor 1963) and the myriad subse-
quent efforts to exploit them to represent meaning despite their inherent limitations
(Bolinger 1965; Eco 1976). All this practical and intellectual effort is ignored here. The
content of this book is light years away from current practical concerns of knowl-
edge representation (www.kr.org), knowledge management (www.cikm.org), or the
relationships within domains of knowledge being explored with UML (www.uml.org)
and XML (www.xml.org). Maybe these criticisms all derive from false hopes raised by
the book’s title. A better title for this book would be Relationships in the Organization of
Library Books.
The first part of the book is “Theoretical Background.” Rebecca Green opens the
book by describing the wide variety of efforts to characterize relations from the biblio-
graphic and documentary points of view. Barbara Tillet follows with a brief, low-level
tutorial on how bibliographic items can be related to each other—for example, how to
describe “works within works,” in which one book contains other books. Next, Stella
Dextre Clarke describes the International Standards Organization (ISO) relations used
in manually built thesauri (e.g., BT for broader term, NT for narrower term, and their
multiple variants). Here, Dextre Clarke shows how the same word is described incom-
patibly in different thesauri; she also shows in a table a number of ways in which the

RT (related term) relationship actually covers a wide variety of relations (e.g., “whole-
part,” “action and its patient,” “causal dependence,” “concept and its opposite,” and
11 other relations with examples). Jessica Milstead, in her chapter about standards for
relations between subject-indexing terms, laments how much latitude is possible in in-
terpreting relations mentioned in thesaural standards. Their interpretations, she says,
may be reasonably evident to a human manipulating the thesaurus, but she warns
that “[i]t is when the thesaurus sits behind the interface as a tool to be applied [au-
tomatically] by the system that more precise specification of equivalence relations is
required”.
Michele Hudon describes the drawbacks of multilingual thesauri, so that, for ex-
ample, even though words may pass as translations, restriction of meanings makes
thesaural relations between near-translations quickly diverge. For example, transla-
tions of the hyponyms of the English word education are not hyponyms under the
French word ´education, which, though a near-translation, has a more restricted mean-
ing than the English word. Some of the translations would have to be hyponyms of
the French word enseignement. At the end of her contribution, Hudon refers to work
on EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998) that has been addressing this problem.
Olivier Bodenreider and Carol A. Bean, one of the editors, talk about some of
the problems involved in integrating different thesauri into one coherent organiza-
tion, giving details about the structure of shared medical vocabularies of the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS). This chapter contains many pointers to medical
terminological resources on the Web, to which one could add the International Med-
ical Informatics Association Working Group 6 on Medical Concept Representation
(www.mayo.edu/imia-wg6/).
Clare Beghtol offers a philosophical musing on structure and meaning, following
a historical trajectory from Aristotle through to the Dewey decimal system and social
psychology. The editors then come back with a chapter on relevance relations. This
chapter might be at home in a book about information retrieval (which is adequately
cited here), but seems out of sync with the rest of the book, which hovers around
classic cataloguing and thesaurus use. In this chapter, Bean and Green present some
of their previous research that attempted to typify the relations between a topical guide
to scriptures and the passages cited as relevant to the topics in the guide. The research
found that “topical relevance relations include a wide variety of relationships, only
some of which, perhaps only a relatively small proportion, are matching relations”
(page 127). Considering that matching relations are what people use now to browse
the Web, this conclusion is interesting, as is the rest of this chapter’s discussion about
what relevance means.
The second part of the book, titled “Systems,” contains chapters reviewing Li-
brary of Congress subject headings, the structure of the Art and Architecture The-
saurus (www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/aat/), Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH, www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh), a multicultural and multilingual thesaurus from
India, Colon Classification (an attribute-value-type library classification system de-
veloped by S. R. Ranganathan in the early 1950s), and the Dewey decimal system.
This part of the book might be useful to a computational linguist who needs a quick
reference to one of the classic classification systems devised for organizing library
stocks.

<abstract confidence="0.992954087719298">a finite set trees, and close it under the operation of nonterminals by other trees in root node label matches the nonterminal. The set of all terminal strings of trees in the resultant tree-set will be a context-free language (CFL), and for every CFL there will be such a finite set of trees that generates it under substitution. For an elegant formalization of CFLs in these terms, see Rogers (1999, pages 25–26). Now assume an additional operation: besides substituting trees for daughterless nonterminals, you can also squeeze new material into the middle of a tree, substituting for a nonterminal node that has daughters. More precisely, assume a finite set trees that share a special form: each A a single node on its frontier, as foot node, that has the same label as root. Squeezing some A a tree T replacing a node that mother becomes the of root, and everything dominated by to be dominated by foot node. the operation of squeezing in new material from this manner (an operation called tree adjunction) yields a tree-set of which the set of all terminal strings will be a tree adjoining language (TAL), and for every TAL there will be an pair Such a pair (called a tree adjunct grammar in Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi [1975]) is known today as a tree adjoining grammar (TAG). The research program on TAGs that Aravind Joshi has led since 1975 is perhaps the most interesting and significant research program in formal language theory of the last 40 years. General linguists have clearly underrated it, though computational linguists have in general kept more closely in touch with it. The TALs are a mathematically natural class with closure and decision properties very similar to those of the CFLs, including a polynomial-time recognition problem. Several independent but equivalent characterizations of the class have been discovered: Vijay-shanker and Weir (1994) present a weak equivalence result for head grammars (Pollard 1984; Roach 1987), linear indexed grammars (Duske and Parchmann 1984; Gazdar 1988), and combinatory categorial grammars (Steedman 1986). Additionally, Vijayashanker (1988) gave a characterization in terms of embedded pushdown automata; and Rogers (1998) gives a new model-theoretic characterization in terms of linearized terminal strings of threedimensional tree models of monadic second-order logic formulae. Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 1 Moreover, the descriptive capabilities of TAGs make them as plausible a theory of syntax for natural languages as has ever emerged from formal language theory. The ways in which TAGs exceed the descriptive capacity of context-free grammars seems remarkably close to what one would want in a theory of syntax sculpted for human languages. However, like relational grammar in the 1970s and optimality theory in the 1990s, the theory of TAGs has never had the book-length exposition it deserves: there has been no coherent and comprehensive published monograph by the original developers that gives an integrated account of the framework and convincing examples of its application to a well-known language. Adjoining edited by Anne Abeill´e and Owen Rambow, does not entirely fill that gap, though it goes some of the way. It is a refereed collection of papers that were presented in earlier versions at an international workshop on TAGs and related formalisms in Paris in 1994. The editors contribute a substantial introduction, and the 18 other chapters are grouped into three sections: (1) “Formalisms,” (2) “Linguistic Analysis,” and (3) “Processing.” I cannot here summarize or critique all the papers in this rich collection, but I will comment briefly on a few of the papers that I think would on their own justify the purchase of the book (especially at CSLI’s attractively low price of under $25 for the paperback). Chapter 1 is an impressive 68-page essay by Abeill´e and Rambow. An expansion of this essay with fuller exemplification and more precision in formulation, perhaps coauthored with Joshi, might have made an independent monograph on TAGs that would have filled the gap referred to above. But instead this lengthy essay is just an</abstract>

Pullum University of California, Santa Cruz Take a finite set T of trees, and close it under the operation of substitution—replacing daughterless nonterminals by other trees in T whose root node label matches the nonterminal. The set of all terminal strings of trees in the resultant tree-set will be a context-free language (CFL), and for every CFL there will be such a finite set of trees that generates it under substitution. For an elegant formalization of CFLs in these terms, see Rogers (1999, pages 25–26). Now assume an additional operation: besides substituting trees for daughterless nonterminals, you can also squeeze new material into the middle of a tree, substituting it for a nonterminal node that has daughters. More precisely, assume a finite set A of insertable trees that share a special form: each A E A has a single node on its frontier, known as A’s foot node, that has the same label as A’s root. Squeezing some A E A into a tree T E T means replacing a node n in T so that n’s mother becomes the mother of A’s root, and everything dominated by n comes to be dominated by A’s</context>
