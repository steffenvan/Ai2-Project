Interests to realize semantic frames data-
bases as a stable starting point in develop-
ing semantic knowledge based systems
exists in countries such as Germany (the
Salsa project), England (the PropBank pro-
ject), United States (the FrameNet project),
Spain, Japan, etc. I thus propose to create a
semantic frame database for Romanian,
similar to the FrameNet database. Since
creating language resources demands many
temporal, financial and human resources, a
possible solution could be the import of
standardized annotation of a resource de-
veloped for a specific language to other
languages. This paper presents such a
method for the importing of the FrameNet
annotation from English to Romanian.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999615">
The realization of human-computer interaction in
natural language represents a major challenge in
the context of aligning Romania to existing tech-
nologies.
The proposed project aims to introduce the se-
mantic frames and contexts, which define a con-
cept’s sense according to its facultative or
mandatory valences (Baker and Fillmore, 1998), to
Romanian NLP systems. The behavior of the Ro-
manian clauses – mainly the verbal group, around
which all the other sentence complements gravi-
tates in a (more or less) specific order – has been
closely debated in the last years (Irimia, 1997; Do-
brovie-Sorin, 1994; Monachesi, 1998; Barbu,
1999), creating a proper frame for the introduction
of semantic roles.
This paper presents the steps considered for the
achievement of this project. Thus, Section 2 gives
a very brief description of the frame semantics, and
Section 3 presents the realization of a semantic
structures database for the Romanian language,
similar to those existing for English, German, or
Spanish, containing detailed information about the
relations between the semantic meaning and the
syntax of the words. In the last section, some pos-
sible applications of the detection of semantic roles
to written and spoken texts are mentioned (ques-
tion answering systems, summarization systems,
prosody prediction systems), before drawing some
final conclusions.

The FrameNet (FN) lexical-semantic resource is
based on the principles of Frame Semantics (FS).
From FS point of view, the semantic/syntactic fea-
tures of “predicational words”1 (Curteanu, 2003-
2004) are defined in a particular semantic frame.
The sentences are schematic representations of
different situations, including different partici-
pants, objects or other conceptual roles. Being a
linguistically transposed experience, a sentence
represents an event scenario that is structured
around a semantic head. The meaning of this head

can be understood only by expressing the core
frame elements and can, optionally, be enriched
with other semantic features, by expressing some
non-core frame elements.
Fillmore (1968) divides the language representa-
tion into two structures: Surface Structure (the syn-
tactic knowledge) and Deep Structure (the
semantic knowledge). The language process begins
at the Deep Structure level with a non-verbal rep-
resentation (an idea or a thought) and ends in the
Surface Structure, as we express ourselves.
The Case Notions are representations at a se-
mantic level of the lexical arguments. This inven-
tory of cases comprises universal concepts,
possible innate, sufficient for the classification of
the verbs of a language and reusable in all lan-
guages. The list of Fillmore Cases, which will be
considered for the project, includes: Agent, In-
strument, Dative, Experiencer, Locative, Object,
etc.

3 A Parallel Romanian/English FrameNet
Using Annotation Import
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998825">
The first step in the realization of the Romanian
corpus of annotated semantic frames was the man-
ual translation of 110 randomly selected sentences
from the English FN. In order to align the Roma-
nian version with the English one, a larger corpus
was needed, so the translation continued with the
Event frame, summing up to 1094 sentences. This
frame was selected due to its rich frame to frame
relations (Inheritance – Change_of_consistency,
Process_start, etc., Subframe - Change_of_state_
scenario and Using - Process_end). After the se-
lection of the clauses and their translation, the Ro-
manian sentences were aligned with the English
ones using the aligner developed by the Institute of
Research in Artificial Intelligence (Tufiş et al.,
2005). The next step was the automatic import of
the English annotation, followed by a manual veri-
fication, a detection of the mismatching cases and
an optimization process which, based on inference
rules, corrects the automatic annotation.

3.1 Automatic annotation import
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938428571429">
The intuition behind the importing program
(Trandabăţ et al., 2005) is that most of the frames
defined in the English FN are likely to be valid
cross-linguistically, because semantic frames ex-
press conceptual structures, language independent
at the deep structure level. The surface realization
is realized according to each language syntactic
constraints.
The automatic importing program is based on
the correlation of the semantic roles expressed in
English with the translation equivalents in Roma-
nian of the words that realize a specific role. The
automatic import is manually checked in order to
establish the method efficiency.

The starting point for the German, Japanese and
Spanish FN creation was the manual annotation at
FE level of existing corpora for each language. For
Romanian, I propose creating a corpus of semantic
roles starting from the translation of (a part of) the
English corpus of annotated sentences (see Figure
1).

The &lt;annotationSet&gt; tag indicates that a new sen-
tence is annotated. Inside this tag, the &lt;layers&gt; tag
sets the annotation layer (FE - Frame Element, GF
- Grammatical Function or PT - Phrase Type) and
the &lt;sentence&gt; tag encloses the text. The labels are
applied to the words in &lt;text&gt;, indexed by their
character. For example, the tag:
&lt;label name=&amp;quot;Event&amp;quot; ID=&amp;quot;19909459&amp;quot;
cDate=&amp;quot;june 2006&amp;quot; start=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; end=&amp;quot;9&amp;quot;

indicates that the Event frame element is starting
with the first character of the sentence an stops at
the 9th, meaning that the Event FE corresponds to
„Incidentul” (en. The incident).
The general algorithm of the automatic import-
ing program focuses on:

• writing an output XML file containing the

My initial experiment has involved the translation
of approx. 1000 sentences from English FN. The
translations have been realized by professional
translators, so the errors propagated in the corpus
should be minimal. The reported problems during
the translation relate mainly to the lack of the con-
text of English sentences, which generate different
translation variants. However, if the English se-
mantic frame is considered, this problem is sur-
mountable.
The alignment process was performed with the
aligner developed by the Institute of Research in
Artificial Intelligence (Tufiş, 2005), which is con-
sidered to have a precision of 87.17% and a recall
of 70.25%. However, the aligner results were
manually validated before entering the annotation
import program.
The assessment of the correctitude of the ob-
tained Romanian corpus is preformed manually.
The first results of the annotation import show an
overall accuracy of approx. 80%. The validation
focuses on detecting the cases where the import
has failed, trying to discover if the problems are
due to the translation or to the semantic or syntac-
tic specificities of Romanian. Only few translation
errors were found, and even then, the meaning has
been kept and the semantic roles were correctly
assigned. However, there were cases where the
FEs are expressed in English, but are implicit in
the Romanian translation, as in:
[Blood]Undergoer had CONGEALED [thickly]Manner
[on the end of the smashed fibula]Place .
[Sângele]Undergoer se ÎNGROŞĂ [spre capătul
fibulei zdrobite]Place .

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990341463415">
In this paper, I have presented a fast method for
the realization of a Romanian corpus annotated
with semantic frame relations. The main purpose
of creating a quick semantic annotated database is
using it as training corpus for automatic labeled
semantic frames detection. Nowadays, expensive
linguistic resources demanding a lot of time,
money and human resources are created for differ-
ent languages. After their utility is proved, those
resources begin to be imported to other languages
(see for instance the MultiSemCor project2). In this
context, the realization of a Romanian FN is a
challenging project in the frame of Romance FN.
The import method was preferred to the ‘classi-
cal’ creation by hand of a manually annotated cor-
pus because of its possible automation. I
investigate currently the possibility of using a
translation engine for the most time consuming
task, namely the translation of the English sen-
tences. The project will be further developed by
adding to the automatic import program rules dis-
covered though the analysis of the mismatching
cases.
The lack of semantic information was very ob-
vious while working on the QA@CLEF competi-
tion3 (Question Answering task within the Cross
Language Evaluation Forum Competition) last
year (Puşcaşu et al., 2006); having the semantic
frames database (thus a semi-automatic role label-
ing system) can improve the precision of selecting
an appropriate snippet for the desired answer, not
to mention also the benefits for answer generation.
Another application of the semantic frames I am
interested in is prosody prediction. Within the In-
stitute of Computer Science, I have begin to work
at a syntax-prosody interface for Romanian based
on FDG trees of sentences and other syntactical
information to discover the phonological entities
underlying the written text and the topic/focus ar-
ticulation. The algorithm for finding sentence fo-
cus uses the semantic roles as a main component.

Fillmore (1968) divides the language representation into two structures: Surface Structure (the syntactic knowledge) and Deep Structure (the semantic knowledge). The language process begins at the Deep Structure level with a non-verbal representation (an idea or a thought) and ends in the Surface Structure, as we express ourselves. The Case Notions are representations at a semantic level of the lexical arguments. This inventory of cases comprises universal concepts, possible innate, sufficient for the classification of the verbs of a language and reusable in all languages.

The proposed project aims to introduce the semantic frames and contexts, which define a concept’s sense according to its facultative or mandatory valences (Baker and Fillmore, 1998), to Romanian NLP systems. The behavior of the Romanian clauses – mainly the verbal group, around which all the other sentence complements gravitates in a (more or less) specific order – has been closely debated in the last years (Irimia, 1997; Dobrovie-Sorin, 1994; Monachesi, 1998; Barbu, 1999), creating a proper frame for the introduction of semantic roles. This paper presents the steps considered for the achievement of this project. Thus, Section 2 gives a very brief description of the frame semantics, and Section 3 presents the realization of a semantic structures database for the Romanian language, similar to those existing for English, German, or Spanish, containing detailed information about the relations between the semantic meaning and the syntax of the words.

I investigate currently the possibility of using a translation engine for the most time consuming task, namely the translation of the English sentences. The project will be further developed by adding to the automatic import program rules discovered though the analysis of the mismatching cases. The lack of semantic information was very obvious while working on the QA@CLEF competition3 (Question Answering task within the Cross Language Evaluation Forum Competition) last year (Puşcaşu et al., 2006); having the semantic frames database (thus a semi-automatic role labeling system) can improve the precision of selecting an appropriate snippet for the desired answer, not to mention also the benefits for answer generation. Another application of the semantic frames I am interested in is prosody prediction. Within the Institute of Computer Science, I have begin to work at a syntax-prosody interface for Romanian based on FDG trees of sentences and other syntactical information to discover the phonological entities underlying the written text and the topic/focus articulation.

After the selection of the clauses and their translation, the Romanian sentences were aligned with the English ones using the aligner developed by the Institute of Research in Artificial Intelligence (Tufiş et al., 2005). The next step was the automatic import of the English annotation, followed by a manual verification, a detection of the mismatching cases and an optimization process which, based on inference rules, corrects the automatic annotation. 3.1 Automatic annotation import The intuition behind the importing program (Trandabăţ et al., 2005) is that most of the frames defined in the English FN are likely to be valid cross-linguistically, because semantic frames express conceptual structures, language independent at the deep structure level. The surface realization is realized according to each language syntactic constraints. The automatic importing program is based on the correlation of the semantic roles expressed in English with the translation equivalents in Romanian of the words that realize a specific role. The automatic import is manually checked in order to establish the method efficiency. 3.2 The algorithm The starting po</context>

In order to align the Romanian version with the English one, a larger corpus was needed, so the translation continued with the Event frame, summing up to 1094 sentences. This frame was selected due to its rich frame to frame relations (Inheritance – Change_of_consistency, Process_start, etc., Subframe - Change_of_state_ scenario and Using - Process_end).
