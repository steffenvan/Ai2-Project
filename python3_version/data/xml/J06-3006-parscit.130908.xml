The main objective of Bolshakov and Gelbukh’s new textbook in computational linguis-
tics is to provide students in computer science with a foundation in the fundamentals
of general linguistics necessary to develop applied software systems, and to enable
students to make informed choices of proper models and data structures. Although
Spanish-language applications are emphasized, the textbook contains examples from
English, French, Portuguese, and Russian as well. This text is freely available in an
electronic format. Supplementary materials, links to the relevant resources, and errata
can be found on-line as well.
The authors approach linguistic problems using two theoretical frameworks:
meaning–text theory (MTT) (Mel’ˇcuk 1974), and head-driven phrase structure grammar
(HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1994). These choices reflect primarily practical considerations.
On the one hand, MTT can be used to describe any language but is particularly well-
suited for the description of free-word-order languages. On the other hand, HPSG
is arguably the most advanced, widely used, and user-friendly formalism in natural-
language description and processing.
The structure of the book is as follows. Chapter I gives an introduction to different
areas of linguistics and provides an overview of the state of the art in Spanish natural
language processing (NLP).
Chapter II is a brief survey of the history of linguistics from Ferdinand de Saussure
to Leonard Bloomfield to Noam Chomsky, discussing context-free grammars, transfor-
mational grammars, and more up-to-date approaches to grammar. Covering concepts
such as valence, constraints, and unification formalism, the authors introduce Fillmore’s
work (Fillmore 1968), generalized phrase structure grammar (Gazdar et al. 1985), and
HPSG. The last several sections are devoted to MTT. MTT has influenced the design of
new grammar formalisms such as Dependency Tree Grammars, and some aspects have
been adopted into other theories (e.g., integrating lexical functions into Pustejovsky’s
Generative Lexicon; Wanner 1997).
Chapter III provides a sketch of computational linguistics (CL) applications. The
included discussion serves to illustrate that all of the relevant applications require so-
phisticated linguistic knowledge. The general lesson of this chapter can be summarized
thus: “Most language processing tasks can be considered as special cases of the general
task of language understanding, one of the ultimate goals of CL and AI.”
Chapter IV describes the MTT theory in more detail and makes interesting com-
parisons between MTT, HPSG, and Chomskian frameworks. Chapter V introduces the
problem of language modeling in CL. The last section of the book includes various
exercises, review questions, and multiple-choice problems.
This book is a nice addition to the short list of CL textbooks. It is especially
helpful for students in Spanish CL, given its numerous Spanish-related examples and
Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 3
applications. The current volume complements other textbooks available now by of-
fering an overview of MTT, providing a survey of the current state of Spanish NLP
research, introducing the field of CL from the linguistic point of view (explaining what
specific linguistic knowledge is involved in each “CL product” rather than introducing
the techniques used in CL/NLP to create that product), providing plenty of examples
and exercises, and making this book freely available on-line.
For the future editions, I would suggest the inclusion of glosses of the Spanish ex-
amples for the benefit of potential readers who are not Spanish-speakers. Additionally,
exercises, comprehension questions, relevant literature, scientific associations, on-line
tools, and language resources should be listed at the end of each chapter instead of at
the end of the book. This would facilitate the practice, and hence acquisition, of the
relevant skill set, and allow readers to more easily test their comprehension of each
chapter.
This text offers an introduction to the field of linguistics for students who have
already some background in computer science but lack special training in linguis-
tics. However, those using this textbook in the classroom should consider providing
supplementary materials that discuss the fundamental algorithms and techniques for
speech and language processing as well as certain linguistic areas, such as phonetics
and pragmatics. These topics receive relatively little attention here.
