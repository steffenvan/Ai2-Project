In this paper we present a description and evaluation of a
pattern-based approach for definition extraction in Spanish
specialised texts. The system is based on the search for
definitional verbal patterns related to four different kinds of
definitions: analytical, extensional, functional and
synonimical. This system could be helpful in the development
of ontologies, databases of lexical knowledge, glossaries or
specialised dictionaries.

There is a growing interest in the development of systems
for the automatic extraction of information that describe the
meaning of terms. This information occurs in structures
commonly called definitional contexts (DCs), which are
structured by a series of lexical and metalinguistic patterns
that can be automatically recognised. In this context, in this
paper we present a work focused on developing a system
for the automatic extraction of definitional contexts on
Spanish language specialised texts. This system looks for
instances of definitional verbal patterns, filters non-relevant
contexts, identifies the main constituent elements on the
candidates, i.e., terms and definitions, and performs an
automatic ranking of the results.
Firstly, we will describe the structure of DCs;
secondly, we provide a short review of related works; we
then present the methodology followed for the automatic
extraction of DCs together with an evaluation of this
methodology; and lastly, we propose some future work.

Texts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791833333333">
A definitional context is a textual fragment from a
specialised text where a definition of a term is given. Its
basic structure consists of a term (T) and its definition (D),
both elements being connected by typographic or syntactic
patterns. Typographic patterns are punctuation marks
(comas, parenthesis), while syntactic patterns include
definitional verbs –such as definir (to define) or significar
(to signify)– as well as discursive markers –such as es decir
(that is, lit. (it) is to say), or o sea (that is, lit. or be-
subjunctive)–. Apart from these, DCs can include
pragmatic patterns (PPR), which provide conditions for the
use of the term or clarify its meaning, as in en terminos
generales (in general terms) or en este sentido (in this
sense). For example:
“Desde un punto de vista pr‡ctico, los opioides se
definen como compuestos de acci—n directa, cuyos efectos
se ven antagonizados estereoespec’ficamente por la
naloxona.”
In this case, the term opioides is connected to its
definition (compuestos de acci—n directa [ÉJ) by the
verbal pattern se definen como (are defined as), while the
general sense of the context is modified by the pragmatic
pattern desde un punto de vista pr‡ctico (from a practical
point of view).

3. Advances in Definitional Contexts
Extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999452529411765">
Definition extraction from specialised texts has become a
relevant task in the field of information extraction. In order
to extract definitional information, the most common
strategy is to extract certain recurrent patterns, which are
commonly found in DCs.
The use of this kind of patterns has been applied on
different scenarios. One of the first descriptive works can
be found in [1], in which the behaviour of the contexts
where terms occur is described. This work states that, when
authors define a term, they usually employ typographic
patterns to visually highlight the presence of terms and/or
definitions, as well as lexical and metalinguistic patterns
connecting DCs elements by means of syntactic structures.
[2] reinforces this idea was reinforced and also explained
the fact that definitional patterns can provide keys for the
identification of the type of definition occurring in DCs,
which facilitates the task of ontology development.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997837">
The ECODE was developed taking the IULA’s Technical
Corpus from the Institut Universitari de LingŸ’stica
Aplicada (UPF) as starting point. This corpus consists of
specialised documents in the fields of Law, Genome,
Economy, Environment, Medicine, Informatics and
General Language. First, we manually developed a
grammar of verbal patterns for Spanish. We identified 29
verbs related to four different types of definitions:
analytical, extensional, functional and synonimical. The
whole set of verbal patterns is shown in table 1.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.827263">
Table 1. Definitional Verbal patterns
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.996653845070423">
Analytical verbal patterns
ser + art’culo (to be + article)
consistir en (to consist in)
caracterizar como/por (to characterize as/for)
concebir como (to conceibe as)
considerar como (to consider as)
describir como (to describe as)
comprender como (to understand as)
definir como (to define as)
entender como (to understand as)
conocer como (to known as)
denominar como/∅ (to denominate as/∅)
llamar como/∅ (to call as/∅)
nombrar como/∅ (to name as/∅)
Extensional verbal patterns
comprender (to comprehend)
contener (to contain)
incluir (to include)
integrar (to integrate)
constar de (to comprise of)
contar de/con (to count of/with)
consistir de/en (to consist of/in)
formar de/por (to form of/by)
componer de/por (to compose of/by)
constituir de/por (to constitute of/by)
Functional verbal patterns
permitir (to allow)
encargar de (to undertake of)
funcionar como/para (to function as/for)
ocupar como/para (to occupy as/for)
servir como/en/para (to serve as/in/for)
usar como/en/para (to use as/in/for)
emplear como/en/para (to employ as/in/for)
utilizar como/en/para (to utilise as/in/for)
Synonimical verbal patterns
conocer tambien (to known also)
denominar (to denominate also)
llamar (to call also)
nombrar (to name also)
From the table above, we can see different verbs
associated to different types of definitions. In some cases,
the verbs can occur together with different grammatical
particles and can be associated with more than one type of
definition, such as the verb denominar (to denominate),
which can occur in analytical or synonimical DCs with the
nexus como (as) or tambien (also), respectively.
The verbal patterns were searched for taking into
account the next constraints:
Verbal forms: infinitive, participle and conjugate
forms.
Verbal tenses: present and past for verbs without
nexus, any verbal tense for verbs with nexus.
Person: 3rd person singular and plural for verbs
without nexus, any for verbs with nexus.
Distance: each nexus was searched for within a
distance of 15 possible words.
With these restrictions, the system obtains a set of DC
candidates that are next annotated with contextual tags.
These simple tags function as borders in the next automatic
processes. For each occurrence, the definitional verbal
pattern was annotated with “&lt;dvp&gt;&lt;/dvp&gt;”; everything
after the pattern with “&lt;left&gt;&lt;/left&gt;”; everything before the
pattern with “&lt;right&gt;&lt;/right&gt;”; and finally, in those cases
where the verbal pattern includes a nexus, like the adverb
como (as), everything between the verbal pattern and the
nexus was annotated with &lt;nexus&gt;&lt;/nexus&gt;. Here is an
example of a DC annotated with contextual tags:
&lt;left&gt;El metabolismo&lt;/left&gt; &lt;dvp&gt;puede definirse
&lt;/dvp&gt; &lt;nexus&gt;en terminos generales como&lt;/nexus&gt;
&lt;right&gt;la suma de todos los procesos qu’micos (y f’sicos)
implicados.&lt;/right&gt;
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999752">
4.2 Candidates analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981526315789">
Once the DCs were extracted and annotated with
definitional verbal patterns they were analysed with the
purpose of filtering non-relevant contexts. We applied this
step based on the fact that definitional patterns are used not
only in definitional sentences but also in a wider range of
sentences. In the case of verbal patterns, some verbs tend to
have a higher metalinguistic meaning than others. That is
the case of definir (to define) or denominar (to
denominate), vs. concebir (to conceive) or identificar (to
identify), where the last two are used in different contexts.
Moreover, verbs having a high metalinguistic meaning are
not used only for defining terms.
To develop this process, a manual analysis was carried
out to determine the type of grammatical particles or
syntactic sequences occurring in those cases where a DVP
was not used to define a term.
These particles and syntactic sequences were found in
some specific positions, for example: negation particles
such as no (not) or tampoco (either) were found in the first
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989398">

<bodyText confidence="0.9997075">
position before or after the DVP; adverbs like tan (so),
poco (few) as well as sequences like poco más (not more
than) were found between the definitional verb and the
nexus como; also, syntactic sequences such as adjective +
verb were found in the first position after the definitional
verb.
Thus, taking this and other frequently combinations
into consideration as well as the contextual tags previously
annotated, the systems filters contexts as shown in the
following examples:

&lt;der&gt;en nuestro an‡lisis.&lt;/der&gt;.
Once the non-relevant contexts were filtered, the next
process was the identification of terms and definitions in
the DC candidates. Depending on each DVP, the terms and
definitions may appear in some specific positions in
Spanish DCs. For example, in DCs containing the verb
definir (to define), the term may occur in left, nexus or
right position (T se define como D; se define T como D; se
define como T D), while in DCs containing the verb
significar (to signify), terms may appear only in left
position (T significa D). Therefore, in this phase the
automatic process is highly related to deciding the positions
in which the constituent elements could appear.
We decided to use a decision tree to solve this
problem, i.e., to detect by means of logic inferences the
probable positions of terms, definitions and pragmatic
patterns. We established some simple regular expressions
to represent each constituent element1:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999911333333333">
T = BRD (Det) + N + Adj. {0,2} .* BRD
PPR = BRD (sign) (Prep  |Adv) .* (sign) BRD
D = BRD (Det) + N
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999754333333333">
As in the filtering process, the contextual tags function
as borders to demarcate decision tree’s instructions. In
addition, each regular expression could function as a
border. At the first level, the branches of the tree
correspond to the different positions in which constituent
elements may occur (left, nexus or right). At the second
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.624054">
1 Where: Det= determiner, N= name, Adj= adjective, Prep=
preposition, Adv= adverb, BRD= border and “.*”= any word or
group of words.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989558">
level, the branches correspond to the regular expressions of
each DC element. The nodes (branches conjunctions)
correspond to decisions taken from the attributes of each
branch and are also horizontally related by If or If Not
inferences, and vertically through Then inferences. Finally,
the leaves correspond to the assigned position of each
constituent element.
Hence, figure 2 shows an example of the decision tree
inferences needed to identify constituent elements2 in left
position:

&lt;left&gt; = definition  |&lt;right&gt; = term.
To exemplify this we can observe the next context:
“&lt;left&gt;En sus comienzos&lt;/left&gt; &lt;dvp&gt;se
definib&lt;/dvp&gt; &lt;nexus&gt;la psicolog’a como
&lt;/nexus&gt;&lt;right&gt;&amp;quot;la descripcibn y la explicacibn de los
estados de conciencia&amp;quot; (Ladd, 1887).&lt;/right&gt;”
Once the DVP was identified as a CDVP – definir
como (to define as) – the tree infers that left position:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998968666666667">
1. Does not correspond only to a TRE.
2. Does not correspond to a TRE and a PRE.
3. It corresponds only to a PRE.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.953381333333333">
Then: left position is a pragmatic pattern (En sus

goes to nexus’s inferences and finds that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.43923">
1. It does correspond only to a TRE.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998354166666667">
Then: nexus’s position corresponds to the term (la
psicolog’a) and right’s position corresponds to the
definition (“la descripcibn y la explicacibn de los estados
de conciencia [É]”).
As a result, the processed context was reorganised into
terminological entries, as in the following example:

4.3 Evaluation of results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997754625">
In order to complement the system’s processes described
above, we decided to include an automatic ranking of the
results. This automatic evaluation aims to identify those
contexts with more prototypical structures of terms and
definitions as well as structures reinforced by typographic
markers.
Here, the input consists of candidates that were
classified by the system as DCs, and a set of heuristic rules
that analyse the syntactic structure of the elements
automatically classified as term or definition is used to
perform the ranking. Firstly, the ranking process assigns a
numeric value to each identified term and definition of the
candidates. Secondly, it combines those numeric values to
generate a global value for each candidate.
Some of the heuristic rules can be seen in the next
table:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.998332">
Table 3. Example of ranking rules
</tableCaption>
<table confidence="0.998228">
Term = 1 &lt;t&gt;quotation marks .* quotation marks&lt;/t&gt;
Term = 3 &lt;t&gt;.* pronoun .*&lt;/t&gt;
Def = 1 &lt;d&gt;.* that .*&lt;/d&gt;
Def = 3 &lt;d&gt;demostrative pronoun&lt;/d&gt;
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99968025">
From the table above we can observe different rules
that assign different values to the structure of terms and
definitions. Value 1 means the best result, while 3 means
the worst; candidates that do not follow any of the rules are
assigned the value 2 by default. In the case of term’s
structures, the value 1 is assigned to those structures that
are present between quotation marks, while a value of 3 is
assigned to those candidates where the term structure
consists of a pronoun, which could indicate a possible
anaphoric reference. In the case of definition’s rules, the
value 1 is assigned to those structures where a relative
clause is introduced after the pronoun que (that), which can
be a prototypical structure in analytical definitions, while a
value of 3 is given to the cases that consist only of a
demonstrative pronoun. In the next table we illustrate some
examples of each case:

5. Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999713">
To develop the evaluation procedure we also used the
IULA’s technical corpus in Spanish. Taking into account
that our system aims to identify DCs by searching for
instances of definitional verbal patterns, we decided to set
up a sub-corpus containing occurrences of the lemmas of
the verbs from our grammar of verbal patterns. We
searched for the first 250 occurrences of each verbal pattern
(or all of the occurrences when they where less than 250),
which produced a sub-corpus of 5809 sentences. Each one
of those sentences was manually classified as DC or Non-
Relevant, and was used as the input to the system to
perform the evaluation.
We used precision &amp; recall to evaluate the system
performance. In this case, precision is the total number of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997102">
11
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998775">
DCs automatically extracted, over the total number of
candidates the system automatically identified as DCs,
while recall is the number of DCs automatically extracted,
over the total number of DCs presented in the evaluation
sub-corpus.
The precision &amp; recall results can be found in the next
table:

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.990674928571429">
It can be seen that almost the 80% of the total number
of DCs was automatically extracted, while less than the
50% percent of the candidates was identified as noise, i.e.,
contexts that the system considers to be DCs but where
manually tagged as Non-Relevant. In the case of recall, the
system did not identify any candidates that were manually
considered to be DCs.
In order to obtain a more specific scenario of the
system’s performance, we decided to apply an evaluation
procedure for each kind of verbal patterns. For this
purpose, we only considered those contexts containing one
definitional verbal pattern. In this case, the sub-corpus
consists of 4799 occurrences and the results are shown in
the following table:

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999638866666667">
In general terms, it can be seen that the best results
were obtained for synonimical patterns, while the lower
values were obtained for the recall of the extensional
patterns, and the precision for the functional patterns. These
may be due to the fact that extensional patterns include
verbs that can be used in a wider range of sentences and not
only to introduce definitional information. Synonimical
patterns, on the other hand, include verbs such as conocer
(to known), denominar (to denominate), llamar (to call)
and nombrar (to call) which, in conjunction with the
particle tambien (also) seems to be more reliable for the
recovering of definitional information. Analytical patterns
show that some of the verbal forms can introduce a wider
range of sentences that are considered to be noise. The
same situation applies for the functional patterns.

<abstract confidence="0.999934888888889">In this paper we present a description and evaluation of a pattern-based approach for definition extraction in Spanish specialised texts. The system is based on the search for definitional verbal patterns related to four different kinds of definitions: analytical, extensional, functional and synonimical. This system could be helpful in the development of ontologies, databases of lexical knowledge, glossaries or specialised dictionaries.</abstract>

Advances in Definitional Contexts Extraction Definition extraction from specialised texts has become a relevant task in the field of information extraction. In order to extract definitional information, the most common strategy is to extract certain recurrent patterns, which are commonly found in DCs. The use of this kind of patterns has been applied on different scenarios. One of the first descriptive works can be found in [1], in which the behaviour of the contexts where terms occur is described. This work states that, when authors define a term, they usually employ typographic patterns to visually highlight the presence of terms and/or definitions, as well as lexical and metalinguistic patterns connecting DCs elements by means of syntactic structures. [2] reinforces this idea was reinforced and also explained the fact that definitional patterns can provide keys for the identification of the type of definition occurring in DCs, which facilitates the task of ontology development. 7 Workshop On Definition Extraction</context>
