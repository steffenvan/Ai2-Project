Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998999">
The development of robust “deep” linguis-
tic parsers is known to be a difficult task.
Few such systems can claim to satisfy the
needs of large-scale NLP applications in
terms of robustness, efficiency, granular-
ity or precision. Adapting such systems
to more than one language makes the task
even more challenging.
This paper describes some of the proper-
ties of Fips, a multilingual parsing sys-
tem that has been for a number of years
(and still is) under development at LATL.
Based on Chomsky’s generative grammar
for its grammatical aspects, and on object-
oriented (OO) sofware engineering tech-
niques for its implementation, Fips is de-
signed to efficiently parse the four Swiss
“national” languages (German, French,
Italian and English) to which we also
added Spanish and (more recently) Greek.

<bodyText confidence="0.999981578947368">
This papers describes the Fips project, which
aims at developing a robust, multilingual “deep”
linguistic parsing system efficient enough for a
wide-range of NLP applications. The system
is currently available for six languages (English,
French, German, Italian, Spanish and Greek), and
has been extensively used for terminology extrac-
tion (Seretan &amp; Wehrli, 2006), as well as for ter-
minology assistance and translation (Wehrli, 2004,
2006).
This paper is organized as follows. The next
section gives an overview of the Fips parser, de-
scribing some of its linguistic properties and its
main processes. In section 3, we present the
object-oriented design adopted for the project.
Section 4 discusses some cases of cross-linguistic
syntactic variation. Finally, section 5 provides
some details about the results and presents an eval-
uation of the parser for the six languages.

Fips is a robust “deep” linguistic parser which as-
signs to an input sentence an enriched S-structure
type of representation, along with a predicate-
argument representation. Fips can also be used
as a tagger, outputing for each word of a given
sentence a POS-tag and optionally the grammat-
ical function (associated to the first word of a con-
stituent), the base form (citation form) of the word,
and whether a word is part of an expression or a
collocation.
As an illustation, figure 1 shows the enriched
structure representation and figure 2 the POS-tags
returned by Fips for sentence (1). Notation is ex-
plained below.

The linguistic assumptions used in this project
correspond roughly to a free-adaptation of Chom-
sky’s generative linguistics, borrowing concepts
from the Minimalist model (Chomsky, 1995,
2004), from the Simpler Syntax model (Culicover
&amp; Jackendoff, 2005), as well as from Lexical
Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 1982, 2001).

Roughly, the grammar is lexicalist, exploiting a
rich lexicon which specifies, among others,
• the selectional properties of functional ele-
ments such as prepositions, auxiliaries, deter-
miners, etc. For instance, the English auxil-
iary have selects a [+past participle] verbal
projection. Similarly, in German, werden se-
lects an infinitival verbal complement;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977384">
• arguments selected by predicative heads
(nouns, verbs, adjectives);
• other syntactic or semantic features which
might be relevant for syntactic processing
such as [+pronominal] feature associated to
certain verbs in French, Italian, German, etc.,
types and subtypes of adverbs, control prop-
erties of verbs selecting infinitival comple-
ments, and so on.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999166017241379">
As shown in figure 1 above, the fundamental
structures built by Fips all follow the same pat-
tern, that is : LeftSubconstituents Head RightSub-
constituents, which can be abbreviated as L X R,
where L stands for the (possibly empty) list of
left subconstituents, X for the (possibly empty)
head of the phrase and R for the (possibly empty)
list of right subconstituents. The possible val-
ues for X are the usual lexical categories Adverb,
Adjective, Noun, Determiner, Verb, Preposition,
Complementizer, Interjection. To this list we add
the functional category Tense, which is the head
of a sentence (TP), as well as Functional, used to
represent predicative objects headed either by an
adjective, an adverb, a noun or a preposition.
Compared to current mainstream Chomskyan
representations, Fips constituent structures are rel-
atively flat and make a rather parsimonious use of
functional projections. They do, however, contain
empty categories, either to represent empty sub-
jects, for instance in infinitival complements, rep-
resented as sentences with a (usually lexically un-
realized) subject. Empty categories are also used
to represent “traces” of extraposed constituents, as
in wh-constructions, where a chain of coindexed
constituents is computed, headed by the extra-
posed element and footed by its “trace”, an empty
constituent in argument or adjunct position. An
example of such chain is given in figure 1, where
the noun record is first coindexed with the (lex-
ically unrealized) relative pronoun in the speci-
fier position of the CP constituent, which is itself
related to the empty constituent [ DP e]i in the
canonical direct object position of the verb form
broke.
Although quite complex, the computation of
such chains brings many benefits in terms of qual-
ity and accuracy of the analysis. One clear exam-
ple is provided by the identification of collocation,
as exemplified in example (1) with the collocation
break-record. In that sentence, the two terms of
the collocation do not occur in the expected order
and do not even occur in the same clause, since
record is the subject of the main clause, while
broke is in the relative clause. However, as the
structure give in fig. 1 shows, the presence of the
“trace” of record in the direct object position of
the verb form broke makes the identification of the
collocation rather simple, and fig. 2 confirms that
Fips has indeed recognized the collocation.
The grammar itself consists of both rules and
processes. Rules specify the attachment of con-
stituents, thus determining, at least for the main
part, the constituent structure associated to a sen-
tence. The grammatical processes, which roughly
correspond to some of the earlier transformation
rules of Generative Grammar, are primarily re-
sponsible for tasks such as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999770818181818">
• filling up the argument table associated with
predicative elements (mostly verbs);
• chain formation, ie. establishing a link be-
tween an extraposed element, such as a wh-
element and an empty category in an argu-
ment or adjunct canonical position;
• modifications of the argument structure of
predicates (adding, deleting, modifying argu-
ments), as is necessary to account for passive
or Romance causative constructions;
• coordination or enumeration structures.

In all such cases, the claim is that a procedural
account is simpler than a rule-based description,
leading furthermore to a more efficient implemen-
tation.

3 Object-oriented design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974609375">
The computational model adopted for the Fips
project relies on object-oriented (OO) concepts
(see, for instance, M¨ossenb¨ock, 1995). An ab-
stract model is assumed both for objects and
for their associated procedures (usually called
“methods” in OO-jargon) – roughly correspond-
ing to the “universal” linguistic level – from which
language-specific objects and procedures are de-
rived. In other words, linguistic objects are defined
as abstract data types, whose implementation can
vary from language to language. Such variation
is handled by the type extension feature provided
by OO-models when the variation concerns data
structures or by the procedure redefinition feature
when variation concerns a process.
Fips relies on three main objects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.834382444444444">
• lexical units (LexicalItem), which correspond
to the “words” of a language, as they appear
in the lexical database;
• syntactic projections (Projection), which are
the syntactic constituents;
• items (Item), which correspond to an analysis
(partial or complete) – since the parser uses a
parallel strategy, many items are maintained
throughout the parsing process.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997328">
The main procedures (methods) associated to
those objects are Project, Merge and Move, cor-
responding to the operation of projection, combi-
nation and movement, respectively. The following
subsections will briefly discuss them in turn.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997716">
3.1 Project
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999971">
The projection mechanism creates a syntactic
constituent (an object of type Projection in our
model), either on the basis of a lexical object, or on
the basis of another syntactic constituent. For in-
stance, any lexical item, as computed and retrieved
from the lexical database by the lexical analysis is
projected into a syntactic constituent, with the lex-
ical item as its head. Thus, given lex, a lexical
item, lex.Project(p) creates a syntactic projection
p headed by lex, as in example (2):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.892043">
(2)a. chat −→ [ NP chat ]
b. eine −→ [ DP eine ]
c. with −→ [ PP with ]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971734363636364">
A more powerful variant of the projection
mechanism, called metaprojection, can create
richer syntactic constituents based either on spe-
cific lexical items or on other syntactic projec-
tions. For instance, we consider pronouns to be
nominal-type lexical elements which project to a
DP level. Similarly, verbs are taken as sentence
heads, and will therefore give rise to richer syn-
tactic constituents, as illustrated in the following
examples:
(3)a. pronouns
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.871705">

c. reads
[TP [VP reads ] ]
d. regnet (“rains”)
[ CP regneti [ TP [VP ei ] ] ]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998236">
Notice that the position of the tensed verb is dif-
ferent in the the structures given in (3b,c,d). We
assume that tensed verbs in French (and more gen-
erally in Romance) “move” to the head of TP, as
shown in (3b), while such movement does not oc-
cur in English (3c). An even more drastic example
of metaprojection occurs in German, where we as-
sume that a whole clause structure is projected on
the basis of a tensed verb (in matrix clause), as il-
lustrated in (3d).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998631">
3.2 Merge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982333333334">
Merge is the fundamental combination mechanism
in our parsing model. Each time the parser reads
a word, it is first transformed into a syntactic
constituent, a projection, as we have just seen.
The projection, in turn, must now be combined
(merged) with (partial or complete) constituents
in its immediate left context. Two scenarios are
considered, corresponding to left attachment and
to right attachment. Left attachment occurs when
the projection in the left context of the new pro-
jection can be attached as a left subconstituent of
the new projection. Right attachment corresponds
to the situation where the new projection can be
attached as a right subconstituent of the projection
in its left context. In fact, to be more accurate, the
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996776375">
incoming projection can attach as a subconstituent
not just of the projection in its left context, but to
any active node of it, as illustrated in Figure 3 be-
low:
Merge must be validated either by lexical prop-
erties such as selectional features or by general
properties (adverbs, adjuncts, parentheticals can
relatively freely modify projections).

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97109475">
Although the general architecture of surface struc-
tures results from the combination of projection
and merge operations, an additional mechanism
is necessary to satisfy well-formedness conditions
such as thematic assignment. As mentioned ear-
lier, such a mechanism reveals quite useful for the
collocation identification process (cf. fig. 2). This
mechanism handles extraposed elements and link
them to empty constituents in canonical positions,
thereby creating a chain between the base (canoni-
cal) position and the surface (extraposed) position
of the moved constituent. To take another simple
example, let us consider the interrogative sentence
given in (4a) and the (slightly simplified) associ-
ated structure in (4b):
(4)a. who did you invite ?
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.878652666666667">
b. [ CP [ DP who]i didj [ TP [ DP you ] ej [ VP
invite [ e]i ] ] ]
DP
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999640625">
The chain mechanism functions as follows: as
the parser encounters a wh-word in an extraposed
position, it stores it in a stack associated with its
governing category (typically the CP projection
which dominates it). As the parse proceeds, the
stack is transferred along the right edge of the
structure, provided it does violate island condi-
tions (cf. Ross, 1967). Whenever a predicative el-
ement is added to the structure, an attempt is made
to complete the chain, ie. to interpret the projec-
tion on top of the stack with respect to the predi-
cate. If successful, an empty category coindexed
with the extraposed projection is inserted into the
structure and the projection is removed from the
stack. At the end of the parse, items containing
unresolved chains are heavily penalized.

To illustrate the parsing procedure and the inter-
action of the 3 mechanisms described above, con-
sider the following simple sentence in French.
(5)a. Paul mange une pomme.

<listItem confidence="0.607769333333333">
b. [TP [DP [NP Paul ] ] mangei [VPei [DP une

Step 1 the parser reads “Paul” and metaprojects a
DP structure [ DP [NP Paul ] ].
Step 2 the parser reads “manges” and metapro-
jects a TP-VP structure [ TP mangei [ VP ei ]
]. A merge operation is possible with the pre-
ceding DP structure, which yields [ TP [ DP
[NP Paul ] ] mangei [ VP ei ] ].
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999781">
Step 3 the parser reads the determiner “une” and
creates a DP structure [DP une ]. A merge op-
eration is possible with the left-adjacent TP
constituent, with DP attached as right con-
stituent of the internal VP node [
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6133145">
TP [DP
[NP Paul ] ] mangei [ VP ei [ DP une ] ] ].
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9925782">
Step 4 the parser reads the noun “pomme”, cre-
ates an NP structure [NP pomme ], and attach
it (merge operation) as a right constituent of
the DP structure in the TP structure, which
yields the complete structure (5b).

3.5 The grammar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934125">
Merge operations are constrained by various
mostly language-specific conditions which can be
described by means of rules. Those rules are
stated in a pseudo formalism which attempts to be
both intuitive for linguists and relatively straight-
forward to code. The conditions associated to the
rules take the form of boolean functions, as de-
scribed in the examples (6) for left attachments

<bodyText confidence="0.998314904761905">
Rule 6a specifies that an adjective projection
structure (an AP constituent) can (left-)merge with
a noun projection structure (an NP constituent) un-
der the two conditions (i) that the first constituent
(the adjective) bears the feature prenominal
and (ii) that both constituents agree in number and
gender. This rule, which is part of our French
grammar, will allow for petit animal (“small ani-
mal”), but not pr´ehistorique animal (“prehistorical
animal”), since the adjective pr´ehistorique does
not bear the feature [+prenominal], nor pe-
tit animaux (“small animals”), since petit is singu-
lar while animaux is plural and hence both do not
agree in number.
Rule (6b) is taken from our German grammar. It
states that a common noun can be (right-)attached
to a determiner phrase, under the conditions (i)
that the head of the DP bears the selectional fea-
ture [+Ncomplement] (ie. the determiner se-
lects a noun), and (ii) the determiner and the noun
agree in gender, number and case.

3.6 Procedural grammar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970777777778">
One of the original features of the Fips parser is its
procedural approach to several grammatical prop-
erties. In addition to the chain mechanism de-
scribed in the previous section, the procedural ap-
proach also concerns the treatment of passive and
other restructuring constructions, as well as coor-
dination. The next two paragraphs briefly sketch
our treatment of passive and coordination con-
structions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.549945">
3.6.1 passives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941785714286">
Along with many linguists or various persua-
sions, we assume that the fundamental property
of passives is the elimination (or demotion) of the
subject argument of a predicate. Based on that
assumption, our treatment is essentially a case of
argument-structure modification: demotion of the
subject argument to an optional “by-phrase” ar-
gument, promotion of the direct object argument
to the subject argument slot. In our implemen-
tation, the treatment of passives takes the form
of a grammar rule specifying the attachment of a
[+past participle] verbal projection as complement
of the passive auxiliary. This attachment triggers
the restructuring process described above1.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.771787">
3.6.2 coordination
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999752777777778">
Coordinate structures constitute a well-known
problem for both theoretical and computational
linguistics. For the latter, coordination is prob-
lematic because it is a major source of non-
determinism. Given the fact that such structures
are extremely common in both speech and writ-
ing, it is therefore mandatory for NLP systems to
handle them efficiently. Our treatment of coordi-
nation is based on the following assumptions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999091777777778">
• Coordination can affect any pair of like con-
stituents;
• coordinate structures do not strictly obey the
X schema. They have the following structure:
[ XP [ ConjP XP Conj XP ] ], where X takes
its value in the set of lexical categories aug-
mented by T and F (see section 2 above), and
CONJ is a coordination conjunction (eg. and,
or, but, etc.).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.91123095">
The coordination procedure is triggered by the
presence of a conjunction. All the nodes on the
right edge of the constituent in its immediate left
context are considered potential candidates for the
coordination structure. A metaprojection creates
a coordinate projection, in which the node on the
right edge is the left subconstituent of the conjunc-
tion. The set of such projections is quickly filtered
out by further incoming material.
To illustrate our treatment of coordinate struc-
tures, in particular the type of structure we assume
(slightly simplified in the (8) sentences) as well as
the potential ambiguity of coordination, consider
the following simple English examples.
(7)a. the old men and women
b. [ DP [ConjP [ DP the [ NP [ AP old ] men
] ]

4 Examples of cross-linguistic variation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964588235294">
In the Fips system, language variation occurs not
only at the level of the grammar, as expected, but
also at the level of the associated procedures. Con-
sider for example, the case of the argument check-
ing procedure. Whereas a preverbal DP can be in-
terpreted as the subject of a verb if it agrees with
it (number, person) in languages such as French
or English (as well as other so-called “configu-
rational languages”), the same criteria would not
hold for case-marked languages, such as German
or Modern Greek. In those languages, subjects
can essentially occur anywhere in the sentence but
must be marked [+nominative] and of course
agree with the verb (number, person)2. Relatively
similar at an abstract level, the argument check-
ing procedure must be “tuned” for each individual
language.
Our second example of cross-linguistic varia-
tion concerns clitic pronouns. The relevant data
structures (objects) and interpretation procedures
(methods) to handle clitics are defined at an ab-
stract level. Specific languages (ie. Spanish, Ital-
ian, French, Greek, etc.) inherit those objects
and methods, which they can further specialize ac-
cording to language-specific properties and con-
straints. The general mechanism to handle clitics
comprises two distinct steps: attachment and in-
terpretation3. As a clitic is read (as an independent
word or as an orthographically attached affix), it is
attached to the head of the verb form which fol-
lows it (proclitic) or which precedes it (enclitic).
Since this verbal head is not necessarily the one
with respect to which the clitic pronoun can be in-
terpreted (it might be an auxiliary, for instance),
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9955698">
2We assume that German (and Modern Greek) are so-
called scrambling languages with an unmarked basic word
order (cf. Haider and Rosengren, 1998, Hinterh¨olzl, 2006).
3From now on, the discussion will only focus on Romance
clitics.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.988063181818182">
a temporary data structure is used to store clitics
until the parser has identified the main predicate
of the sentence4. Only then can the interpretation
process start. All the clitics in the temporary data
structure must be interpreted either as argument or
as adjunct of the verb5. The examples below il-
lustrate our analysis of clitics, applied to Italian
(9), French (10) and Spanish (11). The Italian and
French examples display proclitics (pre-verbal cl-
itics), while the Spanish example is a case of encl-
itics (post-verbal clitics). Notice also that in Ital-
ian and Spanish we have clitic clusters (two clitics
concatenated in one orthographical word), and in
the Spanish example, the cluster is itself concate-
nated to the verb. In all three examples, the clitic
pronouns have be properly analyzed, ie. inter-
preted as arguments of the verb. This is expressed
in the resulting structures by the chains connect-
ing a pronoun and an empty category in postverbal
position. As in the wh-chains discussed earlier, all
the elements are coindexed.

b. [ TP [ DP e ] dai-mej-lok [ VP ei [ PP ej ] [ DP

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998515">
Although very similar in their fundamental be-
havior, clitics across Romance languages are nev-
ertheless too different to be handled by exactly
the same mechanism. Furthermore, even if such
mechanism could be implemented, chances are
that it would prove insufficient or inadequate in
some ways to handle an additional Romance lan-
guage such as Romanian or Portuguese. Our ap-
proach, based on a general abstract mechanism,
which can be specialized to suit the specific prop-
erties of each language seems therefore more ap-
propriate.

complex cases, such as French clitic “en” corresponding to

5 Results and evaluation

To date, the Fips multilingual parser has been de-
veloped for 6 languages (English, French, Ger-
man, Italian, Spanish and Greek). Other lan-
guages have been very partially treated, such as
Romanian, Russian, Polish and Romansch Sursil-
van.
A significant effort has been made at the lexical
level, qualitatively and quantitatively. The table in
figure 4 below shows the curren approximate size
of each lexicon.

At the grammar level, the coverage of the Eng-
lish and French grammar is quite satisfactory, Ital-
ian, Spanish and especially German still need im-
provements, while the Greek grammar is very par-
tial.
Fips attempts to produce complete analyzes
for input sentences. Since the parsing strategy
is (pseudo-)parallel, many analyzes are produced
and ranked according to preferences such as local
vs. non-local attachments, argument vs. adjunct
interpretation, presence vs. absence of a collo-
cation, etc. When a complete analysis fails, the
parser outputs a sequence of partial analyzes cov-
ering the whole sentence.
A comparative evaluation has been conducted
to show how the various implementations of Fips
compare with respect to a near identical cor-
pus, the European Parliament corpus (cf. Koehn,
2005). We parsed approximately 1 million words
in each of the six languages. The table given in
figure 5 show the results:
The first line in table 5 show the size of each file
in terms of symbols (word, punctuation, format-
ting symbol, etc.), approximately 1 million sym-
bols for each file. The second line gives the num-
ber of unknown words, not counting words start-
ing with an uppercase letter which are assumed
to be proper nouns (given the fact that in Ger-
man common nouns are capitalized, we did not
leave aside capitalized unknown words for that
language). The third line indicates the number
of sentences approximately 40’000 for each file,
slightly more for the German file. We can see
that the average length of a sentence is roughly
20 to 25 symbols (slightly more for French). The
fourth line shows the percentage of sentences for
which Fips returned a complete analysis. The best
score is obtained with English (71.95%), closely
followed by French (70.01%). Greek is clearly
behind with only about 31%, largely due to the
fact that its grammar as well as its lexicon have
received much less attention so far. We can ob-
serve a quite clear (and unsurprising) correlation
between rich lexical coverage (English, French)
and high number of complete analyzes.
Finally the last line shows the speed of the
parser in terms of number of words per second.
The mean speed of Fips is between 130 and 180
word/second. FipsGreek is somewhat faster, pre-
sumably because its grammar is less developed
than the grammar of the other languages at this
point. It came up as a surprise to see that FipsEn-
glish was clearly slower. The reason has probably
to do with the high number of lexical ambiguities
of the type N/V (e.g. lead, study, balance, need)
which are likely to significantly increase the num-
ber of parallel (partial) analyzes.

6 Concluding remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981595">
Although the research described in this paper is
by no means completed, it has already achieved
several important goals. First of all, it has shown
that “deep linguistic parsing” should not neces-
sarily be equated with “inefficient parsing”. Al-
though clearly slower than shallow parsers, Fips is
fast enough for such demanding tasks as transla-
tion or terminology extraction.
At the software level, the adopted design makes
it possible to “plug” an additional language with-
out any change or any recompilation of the sys-
tem. It is sufficient to add the language-specific
modules and lexical databases to have a fully func-
tional parser for that language. Arguably the
model has so far not been tested with languages
belonging to widely distinct language types. In
fact, it has only been applied to (a small set) of Eu-
ropean languages. Future work will address that
issue, and we are planning to extend our work to-
wards Asian and Semitic languages.

<abstract confidence="0.994470571428571">The development of robust “deep” linguistic parsers is known to be a difficult task. Few such systems can claim to satisfy the needs of large-scale NLP applications in terms of robustness, efficiency, granularity or precision. Adapting such systems to more than one language makes the task even more challenging. This paper describes some of the properties of Fips, a multilingual parsing system that has been for a number of years (and still is) under development at LATL. Based on Chomsky’s generative grammar for its grammatical aspects, and on objectoriented (OO) sofware engineering techniques for its implementation, Fips is designed to efficiently parse the four Swiss “national” languages (German, French, Italian and English) to which we also added Spanish and (more recently) Greek.</abstract>

The general mechanism to handle clitics comprises two distinct steps: attachment and interpretation3. As a clitic is read (as an independent word or as an orthographically attached affix), it is attached to the head of the verb form which follows it (proclitic) or which precedes it (enclitic). Since this verbal head is not necessarily the one with respect to which the clitic pronoun can be interpreted (it might be an auxiliary, for instance), 2We assume that German (and Modern Greek) are socalled scrambling languages with an unmarked basic word order (cf. Haider and Rosengren, 1998, Hinterh¨olzl, 2006). 3From now on, the discussion will only focus on Romance clitics. a temporary data structure is used to store clitics until the parser has identified the main predicate of the sentence4. Only then can the interpretation process start. All the clitics in the temporary data structure must be interpreted either as argument or as adjunct of the verb5. The examples below illustrate our analysis of clitics, applied to Italian (9), French (10) and Spanish (11). The Italian and French examples display proclitics (pre-verbal clitics), while the Spanish example is a case of encliti</context>

To take another simple example, let us consider the interrogative sentence given in (4a) and the (slightly simplified) associated structure in (4b): (4)a. who did you invite ? b. [ CP [ DP who]i didj [ TP [ DP you ] ej [ VP invite [ e]i ] ] ] DP The chain mechanism functions as follows: as the parser encounters a wh-word in an extraposed position, it stores it in a stack associated with its governing category (typically the CP projection which dominates it). As the parse proceeds, the stack is transferred along the right edge of the structure, provided it does violate island conditions (cf. Ross, 1967). Whenever a predicative element is added to the structure, an attempt is made to complete the chain, ie. to interpret the projection on top of the stack with respect to the predicate. If successful, an empty category coindexed with the extraposed projection is inserted into the structure and the projection is removed from the stack. At the end of the parse, items containing unresolved chains are heavily penalized. 3.4 A parsing example To illustrate the parsing procedure and the interaction of the 3 mechanisms described above, consider the following simple sentence in French.
