<bodyText confidence="0.99845675">
This paper approactEs the question cf whether the
styles ct different prose genres (here referring to
classifications sucli as fiction, newspaper reportage,
learned lcurnals, etc.) are partially characterized by
differences in the co-varLation Of a number of commor
syntactic structures.
Thirty-six syntactic variables are tatulated in sample
sentences drayn frcm five genres. The variable.s are, of
several different scrts; fcr example, sentence types, some
focus phencmena, elements of the verb structure, conjoined
structu&apos;res, and varicus mcdificaticn ard complementation
structures.
The co-variation cf these syntactic variables is
analised Ly means of a dizicriminant function analysis. The
ana&apos;lysis shows that the verbal styles of the specific genres
ccnsidEred are characterized by differential patterns of
ocCurrEnce of the syntactic structures. IE patterns appear
to be primarily interpr-stable as artefacts of the commor
semantic dencminator (or communicative Eurpose) of thoir
genres.

It is clear that linguists should attempt to use all of
the empirical evidence obtainable to describe usefully and
completely th..1 significant patterns which tccur in language
data, but it is nct always clear just what patterns or
relationships in the data should be included in such
descrIptions. One aspect of language data--generally
referred to as style--has been known for some time to be
subjectively rather obvious but extremely difficult to
characterize in objective terms, especially, if one ignores
the obvious role of lexical selection.
It would be possible to talk about style in non-
s.ubjecti&apos;ve terms if one were able to identify those surface
elements of language that appear to participate in .stylistic
variations and then to relate these to subsets of language
data defined by external criteria cf known genre,
provenance, author, or situation. However, simple counts of
elements with respect to such subsets have not proven to be
overly instructive, primarily because it is presumably not
the simple occurrence of the elements which leads one to
perceive a certain style but, rather, the far less obvious
co-occurrence of sets cf elements (Marckwcrth, 1973). These
co-occurrences are ones which are not required by the
5
grammar of a language but which have a high probability of
being linked in the genre in which they occur.
A useful definition of style might be the overall
pattern or gestalt perceivable in language data which
transmits information about an utterance with respect to the
personal, social, and cultural relationships assumed between
speaker and hearer, the historical cr geographical
provenance of the source, and the Identity or mental state
of the speaker. Recognition cf such a gestalt allows the
hearer or reader to assign the language data to a specific
subpopulaticn about which he already has pratotype
information.
Assuming this provides a workable view of style, then
the basic task cf an investigation of the phenomenon is °Tie
of generating hypotheses about possible language-element
p&amp;rticiparits in style-markinq constellations which can be
investigated in themselves and in patterns et co-occurrence.
The results of such investigations, if ticcessIul in
differentiating externally defined sutpopulations of
language, will provide additional data ab-out language to
which any grammatical de5.cription must be responsible.
Genre, the focal point of this study, is quite
difficult to define in specific terms. As Marckworth
(1973, .pp. 24-25) has noted.:
</bodyText>

Genre tends to be a Humpty-Dumpy term, a useful
concept which is redefined Within the limits of
each discussion of it with lit-tle requirement that
such definitions have more than a superficial
agreement with each other. 6enre may distinguish
prose from poetry from drama; it may distinguish
historical plays from French farces, scnnets from
epics, mystery stories from all other novels. As a
construct it 41as, in fact, much in common with
classification as defined by pattern recognition
studies: a group of items along some
characteristic (attribute) continuum whose members
are closer to each other than to their neighbors
and which are not separated by a gap across a
critical perceptual bcundary or distance. The
characteristic of the continuum and the critical
distance are continually respecifiable in terms of
the stimuli perceived and the fineness of the
classificatory system required.
i‘hen viewed in these terms, it is immediately
clear why Aenre is at once such a vague and such a
useful term. Cohtinua based on a number of
different characteristics may be used as the basis
for defining clusters of similar texts and the
genre classifications formed on different continua
need not be parallel nor form mutually exclusive
groups. Some of the continua used in genre
classification are content, as in the case of the
myS-tery story or the Cavalier love poems; intent,
as in the case of humorous writing or fantasy;
form, as in the case of drama or the novel; and
context, as in the case of technical or
belletristic prose. This is not to claim that such
characteristics are independent of each other or
that any text may not be defined in terms of all
four; simply that groupings along a continuum
defined by any one of them alone may be cited to
establish contrast.ing genres.
This paper reports an investigation of a large variety
of surface syntactic features, ranging from sentence type
through elements of the verb, and the covariant patterns of
occurrence of such structures in five genres of written
modern English. It is recognized, of course, that powerful

selection) and supra-sentential (e.-g„ general content)

the lemel of the sentence, the contribution of syntactic
devices to a measurable difference in genre-defined styles.

Thirty-six syntactic structures were selected for
consideration on the tasis of being possible contributors to
the constellations determinin2 genre style. They were chosen
from four mairi categories; sentence-type, including the
range of possible.. interrogative patterns; focus phenomena of
various sorts; elements of the main verb phrase; and a group
of corloined or embedded structures. This latter group
included structures of noun-phrase modification, verbal
complementation, sentence modification, and parallel element
conjoining.
Table 1 shows the syntactic structures whose frequency
of occurrence was counted, along with the identification
numbers assigned to each of these variables for use in
subsequent tables and discussions. Note that the various
structures are clearly tict completely independent of each
other.

Extraposition, e.g„ implies an embedded clause; a passive
constitcticn implies a transitive verb; conditional clauses
may imply the past tense marker; contracted verbal forms
imply auxiliaries; and emphatic do and other auxiliaries are
mutually exclusive. Hcwever, none of these relationships
(referred to here as grammatical co-occurrence
restriCticns), with the exception of the last, is
reciprccai. Extrayositicn implies an embedded clause, but an
embedded clause does nct necessarily imply extraposition; a
passive construction implies a transitive verb, but a
transitive verb dcec nct imply a passive ccnstruction, etc.
Since tbese various lements are not completeLy redundant,
they are able to operate at least semi-independently as
possible syntactic indicators of style.
Five genres were chosen for investigaticn cn the basis
of ccntext cf utterance which permits identification by
place of publication. The genres selk.ctd were: Learned
Journals, Newspaper Eeportage, Popular Jcurnals, Government
Dccuments, and Fiction.
Ihe actual data were drawn from Frown University
millicn-wcrd English corpus, A Standard Sam2le of Fresentz
dly Edited American En2lish for Use with Dial Computers.
This corpus ccnsists of 500 samples cf English-language
texts published in the United States in 11, each sample
10
approximately 2,CnO words long. This large number of
relatively short samples minimizes the effect of any single
author Or topic, and the restrictions on dame and place of
publication contrcl variables associated with provenance. A
complete description of this corpus and its ccntent may be
found in Francis (1964) or in Kucera &amp; Francis (1967).
A total sample of 5C0 sentences was drawn, 1C0 from
each of the five genres. Each genre subset cf 100 consisted
cf ten sentences from each of ten sentence-length blocks.
Sentence length was measured in words, and the blocks are
shcwn in Table 2.
These block lengths were chosen to miricr roughly the
distribution of sentence lengths in the entire corpus. A
structured sample of this kind was di.awn tc prevent sentence
length as such from acting as a variable since sentence-
length distributicn was already kncwn to differentiate among
genres (Marckworth &amp; Pell, 1967), and also to guarantee that
those syntactic devices which tend to be associated with
greater sentence length wculd have equal cpportunities to
appear within each genre sample. Again, the emphasis in this
study was on the senttrce as the basic unit cf analysis, and
cn the co-cccurrence of syntactic structures within
sentences. ThE reader should keep in mind, however, that a
random sample cf sentences would permit certain sentence

the co-cccurrEnce patterns of interest here but,
nevertheless, reflecting another property which can clearly
be said to character zeigenre style.
Each of the sample sentences was anAlyzed for the
occurrence of the syntactic variables indicated in Table 1,
and the number of occurrences of each structure was
recoraed. A discussion cf the basis on whiot the syntactic
elements were identified may be found in Marckworth (1973,
411-48). The basic data for analysis thus consisted of
FP•
12
500 otservaticns (sentences) with each observation scored on
36 variables and classified by genre and length. The
subsequent analysis of these data was based priaarily on
discriminant functions &apos;which were used to determine how the
variables served to distinviish one genre frcm another.
Easically, discriminant Junction analysis is the
multivariate extension cf the univariate F ratio which is
used to distinguish among previously established groups. It
represents, however, a conSiderable increase in both,
complexity and analytical power since it focuses not only on
the simple, differences between groups on each variable, but
also cn the inter1:elationships among differences on the
several variables considered simultaneously. It serves to
maximize group differences by developing maximally efficient
weights which, when applied to the original, daia, will yield
the clearest distinctions among the groups being analyzed.
The method of discriminant function analysis is discussed
fully in Rulcn, et al. (1S67, pp. 299-319)

18
fiction genres are more alike in syntactic structure than
any cf them are like sentences from ficticn. This may, at
first view, be surprising in light of the range of non-
ficticn genres included in the study, but it tears out the
findings of at least cne ether investigaticr of quantitative
characteristics of the language of different genres
(Marckworth and Bell, 1967, on sentence-length
distributicns): that the major measurable stylistic
distincticr is between fiction and no-n-ficticn genres.
several interesting cbservations may be made about the
syntactic variables that participate in the discrimination
(see Table 4). The mcst obvious pcint is the heavy
invclvement of syntactic features of the verbal unit in
differentiating fiction from non-fiction styles. With the
Exception of inclusicn of direct discourse, which seems
transparently attributable to the dialogue characteristic of
fiction, and tne lack et sassive ccnstructicns, since voice
has been shown tc be a whole-sentence focus phenomenon
(Andrew, 1974), all of the variables in Table 4 arje
associated with verbal rather than nominal Elements cf he
sentence. Marking for last tense and EErfective asEe(;,
intrarsitdve verbs, and contracted verbal fc4ins are all
specific tc the verb phrase, and adverbial clauses and other
advertials are either specifically verb-modifying or are
whcle-sentEnce-modifyjng. Apparently elements of the noun
19
phrase, or at least those considered in this study, do not
participate in the distinctively style-associated
constellations of syntactic structoes that distinguish
fiction from non-faction.
A second notable feature distinguishing the fiction
sentence set is the amount of indication of past time
action. This is conveyed nct only by the formal last tense
variatle, which in the great majority of cases does indicate
a past time action, but also by the perfective aslfct, which
always_ indicates a past time event whether marked for past
cr present tense. This feature is perhaps understandable in
view cf the usual function of fiction as a rarrative of past
events, and it should also be noted that this same function
may utilize another role of per,fective aspfç--that of
interrelating sequential events through time.
A question may be raised about the relationship of two
of the fiction-distinguishing variables: the presence of
intransitive verbs and the absence of passive constructions.
Since these two exhibit a non-reciprocal grammatical co-
occurrence restriction between voic6 and verb type--passive
voice implies a transitive verb but not vice versa--it is
possible that the paucity of passive constructiobs in
fiction is simply an artefact of the trequency of
intransitive verbs. In other words, we muot ask whether
20
passive sentences occur less in fiction than in non-fiction
simply because they have less opportunity to do so, or
whether non-passiveness is an independent syntactic feature
of fiction style. A comFariscn of the ratios of occurrence
of passive construction to transitive veLb in tie fictidm
and non-fiction genres shows the latter case to be the true
one. (Such a ratio expresses the actual occurrence of
passive sEptencPs in relation to the possible occurrences.)
The ratios for the five genre are

<bodyText confidence="0.984663902439024">
It is tempting to speculate about just why the fiction
genre should be characterized by significantly more
intransitive verbs tc cause this variable to be
discriminatory. Cne possible explanation, which suggests a
simple characterization of fiction style, cculd be based on
analyzing a large subset (if not the whole class) of verbs
usually called intransitive as item S which can occur both
with nc object (traditionally called intransitive verbs) and
with one or two objects (traditionally called transitives).
In such an analysis it is presumed that when the
grammatical object of a verb of this class is either
redun cant or not completely specified it is suppressed and
21
the result is a one-place predicate sentence, e.g., John
sang. When the grammatical object carries new or requirea
information it is present and the result is a multiple-place
predicate, e.g., John sans a Greek fclksong. This sort of
analysis cf the &amp;quot;intransitive&amp;quot; verb o.pens the door to a very
general characterization of genre differences. Thus viewed,
the intransitive verb variable characterizes sentences which
are nct heavily infcrmaticn criented--sentences in which a
major component, thE grammatical cbject, is either so
predictable cr sc unimportant that it is nct even specified.
Such sentences are signific,antly more characteristdc of
fiction than cf ncn-ficticn writing, and this analysis of
them suggests a measurable basis for the cid rule of thumb
that successful (although not necessarily good) fiction
wriiirg is strongly action oriented. It also suggests the
validity of the ccmmon-sense intuition that a primary source
of the differences between Liction and non-fiction is that
the latter is designed foremost as an information-conveying
instrument; that in the dichctdmy of literary purpose it is
more likely tc teach than to delightc
Since one of th:e major ways in which infcrmation can be
packed into a sentence is through healiy use of nominal
elements, we locked at a simple measure of thi
characterization of fiction style as action-ariented as
22
opposed to non-fiction style as information-oriented: the
verb/noun ratio for each genre.
These ratios are

tearing cut the supposition that sentences in the non-
fiction genres have acre nouns in proportion to verbs than
do those from fiction. It may also be noted that, in
addition tc being high in nouns in proportion to verb, non-
fiction sentences also exhibit somewhat more noun

Thus, frcm the discriminatory variables identified by
the five-group discriminant function analysis and the
further observations suggested by them, a picture emenges of
distinctive syntactic structure constellations in at least
two major genre categories: fiction, with the syntactic
structures determined by the function of Rast-time, action-
oriented, narrative communication; and non-fiction, with
structures determined by an information-carrying function.
23
The fivP-group discriminant function analysis showed
such a majcr distinction between fiction and the non-fiction
genres that it seemed possible that differences in the non-
ficticn genres might have been obscured. In ccnsequence, a
four-&apos;group discriminant function analysis was done on data
from these genres crly. The result indicated a distinctioE
in syntactic structure between the formal genres (Learned
Journals and Government Documents) ard the informal
(Newspaper &apos;reportage and Popular Journals) alcng the first
axis, and alcng the second axis a distinction between
Popular Jcurnals and Newspaper Reportage. The third
dimension distinguished Learned Journals from Government
rocuments (see Figure 2).

in These three discriminations. These discriminating
structures present a less distinct picture cf different
types cf writing than dc -those differentiating fiction and
non-ficticr, but nevertheless illustrate Ecme interesting
pcint-s abcut genre and style.
Cf the four items that characteri2e informal non-
ficticn sentences, only transitive verb is not susceptible
to immediate explanation, although we can note that its
presence as an informal marker must be due almos,t entirely

discrdgihation between Newspaper Reportage and Popular
Journals, it has a 4Egative weighting for the former; that
is, in the comparison of this pair of genres, Newspaper
Reportage is distinguished by the absence of transitive
verbs (see Variable 16, Discriminant Function II, in Table
5).
The&apos;other three distinguishing features of the informal
genres are inclusion cf direct discourse, contracted verbal
forms, and last tense. Inclusion of direct discourse is
probably present as a result of the tact tlat the parsiag
ptocedure aid not differentiate between true direct
diScourse cf the sort found in fiction dialogue and the
inclusion of quoted material of the sort found in Newspaper
Reportage in which one or two words may be quoted. The
supposition that Newspaper Reportage contributed this
discripinant variable tc the informal category is borne out
by its appearance as a charact_erlstic distinguishing that
genre from Popular Journals, as shown by the second function
in Table 5.
contracted verbal forms are a typical and, frequently,
a deliberate indicator of informal style, which probably
explains the presence of this variable as a discriminator.
In addition, editorial policy (or a writer&apos;s perception of
it) usnally discourages the use of these fcrms in any sort
27
of formal written language, which explains their absence in
Iearhed Journals and Government DocuMents. Why 12.st tense
should differentiate informal from formal non-fiction is not
really clear; one possible contributory cause may b•hat
Learned Journals frequently discuss things as they are (or
appear to be) Government Documents (which in this sample
are largely proclamations of future legal interpretations or
holidays) discuss things as they will be, hut NewspapEr
Reportage discusses things as they have beer.
&apos;Several other transparent discriminatory variables are
to be seen in Table 5. Variable 8, 2Lissilve constructions,
which distinguishes Learned Journals from Government
Documents, is almost certainly a result of conscious
editorial policy. The presence of declarative sentences and
the &apos;absence of im2erative sentencss which distinguish
Newspaper Eeportage frcm Popular Journals are a joint result
of the presence in PoEular Journals of a number of how-to-
dot,it articles: &amp;quot;Hold the brick in your left hand •••,&amp;quot;
A less transparent, but perhaps more analytically
interesting set of variables is shown in gable 5 (32, 33,
26, and 24, 22, 33). The first three, Iartiilly reduced
relative clauses, ,noun adjuncts, and,advertial clauses, are
atypical of informal non-fictioh in the informal/formal
discrimination; the other three arE involved in
28
distinguishing Learhed Journals from GoVernffent Documents--
rominalizations in the noun 211Lase and corjoined words and
Ihrases by their presence in Learned OcUrnals and noun
adjuncts by its absence. (The activity of noun adjuncts as
discriminatory by its absence in both of the informal genres
and in Learned Journals indicates its heavy use in
Government Dccumetts: &amp;quot;I, John Chaffee, Governor of Rhode
Island....&amp;quot;) All fivP of these structures are significantly
characteristic of cne cr both cf the formal non-fiction
genres, and all five are from the category cf conjoined or
embedded syntactic elements—that is, syntactiC structures
&apos;whose primary purpose is to compress and relate information
within the sentence. Seemingly, thoSe gerres in which the
author&apos;s intent is to convey maximum information with
traximuu explicitness are just those that make maximum use of
such syntactic techniques. (We may note in passing tha,t,
except for adverbial clauses and for conjoined words and
2hrases, which may involve either of nouns or verbs, the
signi-ficart element-s are members the noun phrase-; it
appears that only at this level of genre ciscpiminaticn is
anything but a verbal or whole-sentence slement a
significant stylistic indicator.)

<bodyText confidence="0.974011862068966">
ighat seeMs tc te evident from the above resu1t0 is
that, while there are indeed significantly different
patterns syntactic cccuirence between genres, these patterns
(with the exception of editorially determired use of Eassive
ccnt3tructions in Learned Journal style- and avoidance of
contracted verbal fcrms in any formal style) result
primarily from general semantic constraints cperating within
the genres and based in tle coamunicative purposes of the
genres. &apos;lc Witi fiction, nc matter what its topic, is
typically a narraticn cf past but interccnnectesd actions,
and the syntactic structures that differentiate fiction from
rcn-ficticr are ones which ccnvey this semantic content;
non-fictior, again no matter what it is abcut, is in general
a data-ccnveying instrument, even tlough there are
detectable differences in the manner in which the data are
ecnveyed, e.g., degree of specificity cf data (Learned
Jcurrkals), degree of didacticism (Popular Journals), and
degree of included narration (Newspaper Fepertage). Again,
tnese bread semantic similarities and differences are
reflected in the syntactic structures that differentiate the
genre styles. In supmary, quantitative differences in
syntactic str-ucture can indeed be fcund between
indeperdently-definsd sub-populations of language (genres),
but they appear tc ccrtespcnd tc--and are presumably the
30
result of—generic con,municative purposes cf the genres, and
shoul4 ccrsequently be viewed as internally-constrainad
artefacts of this semantic component rather than externally-
definEd elements cf style.

<abstract confidence="0.988546709090909">This paper approactEs the question cf whether the styles ct different prose genres (here referring to classifications sucli as fiction, newspaper reportage, learned lcurnals, etc.) are partially characterized by differences in the co-varLation Of a number of commor syntactic structures. Thirty-six syntactic variables are tatulated in sample sentences drayn frcm five genres. The variable.s are, of several different scrts; fcr example, sentence types, some focus phencmena, elements of the verb structure, conjoined structu&apos;res, and varicus mcdificaticn ard complementation structures. The co-variation cf these syntactic variables is analised Ly means of a dizicriminant function analysis. The ana&apos;lysis shows that the verbal styles of the specific genres ccnsidEred are characterized by differential patterns of of structures. appear to be primarily interpr-stable as artefacts of the commor dencminator (or communicative Eurpose) of genres.

One aspect of language data--generally referred to as style--has been known for some time to be subjectively rather obvious but extremely difficult to characterize in objective terms, especially, if one ignores obvious role of selection. It would be possible to talk about style in nons.ubjecti&apos;ve terms if one were able to identify those surface elements of language that appear to participate in .stylistic variations and then to relate these to subsets of language data defined by external criteria cf known genre, provenance, author, or situation. However, simple counts of elements with respect to such subsets have not proven to be overly instructive, primarily because it is presumably not the simple occurrence of the elements which leads one to perceive a certain style but, rather, the far less obvious co-occurrence of sets cf elements (Marckwcrth, 1973). These are ones not the 5 grammar of a language but which have a high probability of being linked in the genre in which they occur. A useful definition of style might be the overall pattern or gestalt perceivable in language data which transmits information about an utterance with respect to the personal, social, and cultural relationships assumed between speaker and hearer, the historical cr geographical provenance of the source, and the Identity or mental state of the speaker. Recognition cf such a gestalt allows the hearer or reader to assign the language data to a specific subpopulaticn about which he already has pratotype information. Assuming this provides a workable view of style, then the basic task cf an investigation of the phenomenon is °Tie of generating hypotheses about possible language-element p&amp;rticiparits in style-markinq constellations which can be themselves in patterns et co-occurrence. The results of such investigations, if ticcessIul in differentiating externally defined sutpopulations of will provide additional data language to any grammatical be responsible. the focal point of study, is quite difficult to define in specific terms. As Marckworth (1973, .pp. 24-25) has noted.: 6 Genre tends to be a Humpty-Dumpy term, a useful concept which is redefined Within the limits of discussion of it with requirement that such definitions have more than a superficial agreement with each other. 6enre may distinguish prose from poetry from drama; it may distinguish historical plays from French farces, scnnets from epics, mystery stories from all other novels. As a it fact, much in common with classificationas defined by pattern recognition studies: a group of items along some characteristic(attribute) continuum whose members are closer to each other than to their neighbors and which are not separated by a gap across a critical perceptual bcundary or distance. The characteristic of the continuum and the critical distance are continually respecifiable in terms of the stimuli perceived and the fineness of the classificatory system required. i‘hen viewed in these terms, it is immediately clear why Aenre is at once such a vague and such a useful term. Cohtinua based on a number of different characteristics may be used as the basis for defining clusters of similar texts and the genre classifications formed on different continua need not be parallel nor form mutually exclusive groups. Some of the continua used in genre are content, as in the case of story or the Cavalier love poems; intent, as in the case of humorous writing or fantasy; form, as in the case of drama or the novel; and context, as in the case of technical or belletristic prose. This is not to claim that such characteristics are independent of each other or that any text may not be defined in terms of all simply that groupings along continuum by one them alone may be cited to establish contrast.ing genres. This paper reports an investigation of a large variety surface syntactic ranging from sentence type through elements of the verb, and the covariant patterns of occurrence of such structures in five genres of written modern English. It is recognized, of course, that powerful 7 determiners of the recognizability of various genre styles exist at both the infra-sentential (e.g., specific lexical and supra-sentential general but it is the aim oT this study only to the lemel of the sentence, the contribution of syntactic devices to a measurable difference in genre-defined styles. PROCEDURE Thirty-six syntactic structures were selected for consideration on the tasis of being possible contributors to the constellations determinin2 genre style. They were chosen from four mairi categories; sentence-type, including the range of possible.. interrogative patterns; focus phenomena of various sorts; elements of the main verb phrase; and a group or embedded structures. This latter group included structures of noun-phrase modification, verbal complementation, sentence modification, and parallel element conjoining. Table 1 shows the syntactic structures whose frequency occurrence along with the identification numbers assigned to each of these variables for use in subsequent tables and discussions. Note that the various structures are clearly tict completely independent of each other. 8 TAELE 1 SYNTACTIC VARIABLES SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS IMMO Variable Categcry NuRber Variable Naue Sentence 1.

A sample of this kind was tc prevent sentence length as such from acting as a variable since sentencelength distributicn was already kncwn to differentiate among genres (Marckworth &amp; Pell, 1967), and also to guarantee that those syntactic devices which tend to be associated with greater sentence length wculd have equal cpportunities to appear within each genre sample.

The subsequent analysis of these data was based priaarily on discriminant functions &apos;which were used to determine how the variables served to distinviish one genre frcm another. Easically, discriminant Junction analysis is the multivariate extension cf the univariate F ratio which is used to distinguish among previously established groups. It represents, however, a conSiderable increase in both, complexity and analytical power since it focuses not only on differences between groups on each variable, but also cn the inter1:elationships among differences on the several variables considered simultaneously. It serves to maximize group differences by developing maximally efficient weights which, when applied to the original, daia, will yield the clearest distinctions among the groups being analyzed.

Newspaper Reportage from Popular Journals. variables (8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 21, 24, 26, 28, 35, and 3&apos;6) were found significantly to differentiate fidticr from non-fiction (p. &lt; .05); three variables (16, 26, and 33) distinguished. formal from imfortral non-fiction; &apos;lone distinguished between Learned Jourbals and Government Documents; and only one (1) differentiated Newspaper Reportage from Popular Journals.

Variable 6 (imperatives) wolild clearly digtinguish between Newspaper Reportage and Popular Journals, which is nct surprising in view of the number of how-tc-do-it articles in the latter. genre. These two variables (6 and 23) could be and were retained for the discriminant function analyses. The remaining variables (10, 22, 25, 30, 31,. 32, and 34) showed nc distinction as indices four tests but they were, nevertheless, alsc retained for the multivariate analysis since they cculd, when analyzed in conjurction with other variables, still previde infcrmation for genre distinction. This is ecause the simple univariate analyses aboVe dc not takeinto account the possible interccrrelaticns (ccnstellaticn effects) among the variables. The first multivariate analysis was a five-group discriminant function analysis, performed on the five genres. It indicated a clear differentiaticr of fiction from the fcur ncn-fiction genres (see Figure 1), cn the basis of eight variables listed Table 4. These demcnstrate that sentences from all cf the non- .8 Legend: GD = golrernment documents LJ = learned journals PJ popular journals NR = newpapor reportage F = fiction F • H H z H P U z = F-1-, Z t4 u m NR PJ 0 ....••••..........0.111■•....m...m.....-II- .2 .4 .6 .8 1.0 1.2 DISCRIMINANT FUNCTIONI figure 1. not of the grouf, centrcids for the five genres on the first two discriminant functions. t ) .. prn • • 17 TABLE 4 VARIABLES EISCRIMINAT:OG FROM THE FCUE 1C-FICTION GENRES Variable Number Variabl.e Discriminant Weight* 15 past tense marking .73 20 contracted verbal _forms .47 17 intransitive verbs .43 13 perfective aspect .39 26 adVerbial clauses .36 23 inclusion of direct discourse .32 36 other adverbials .27 pas-sive construction -.26 * Those variables having a positive value are characteristic of ficticn sentences, but not of non-fiction; those values with a negative value, vice versa. 18 genres are alike in syntactic than any cf them are like sentences from ficticn. This may, at first view, be surprising in light of the range of nongenres included in the study, but out the of at least ether of of the of different genres (Marckworth and Bell, 1967, on sentence-length that major measurable stylistic is between fiction and genres. several interesting cbservations may be made about the syntactic variables that participate in the discrimination Table 4). The mcst pcint is the heavy invclvement of syntactic features of the verbal unit in differentiating fiction from non-fiction styles. With the of inclusicnof direct which seems transparently attributable to the dialogue characteristic of fiction, and tne lack et sassive ccnstructicns, since voice been shown tc whole-sentence focus phenomenon 1974), all of the variables in Table 4 associated with verbal rather than nominal Elements cf Marking for and asEe(;, intrarsitdveverbs, and contracted verbal fc4ins are all specific tc the verb phrase, and adverbial clauses and other advertials are either specifically verb-modifying or are Apparently elements of 19 phrase, or at least those considered in this study, do not participate in the distinctively style-associated constellations of syntactic structoes that distinguish fiction from non-faction. A second notable feature distinguishing the fiction sentence set is the amount of indication of past time This is conveyed nct only by the formal variatle, which in the great majority of cases does indicate a past time action, but also by the perfective aslfct, which always_ indicates a past time event whether marked for past cr present tense. This feature is perhaps understandable in view cf the usual function of fiction as a rarrative of past events, and it should also be noted that this same function utilize another role of per,fective of interrelating sequential events through time. A question may be raised about the relationship of two of the fiction-distinguishing variables: the presence of verbsand the absence of passive constructions. Since these two exhibit a non-reciprocal grammatical cooccurrence restriction between voic6 and verb type--passive voice implies a transitive verb but not vice versa--it is possible that the paucity of passive constructiobs in fiction is simply an artefact of the trequency of intransitiveverbs. In other words, we muot ask whether 20 passive sentences occur less in fiction than in non-fiction simply because they have less opportunity to do so, or whether non-passiveness is an independent syntactic feature of fiction style. A comFariscn of the ratios of occurrence passiveconstruction to transitive tie fictidm and non-fiction genres shows the latter case to be the true (Such actual occurrence passive sEptencPs in relation to the possible occurrences.) The ratios for the five genre are Fiction .085 learned Journals Newspaper Reportage Popular Journals Government Documents .402 .248 .232 . It is tempting to speculate about just why the fiction genre should be characterized by significantly more intransitive verbs tc cause this variable to be discriminatory. Cne possible explanation, which suggests a characterization of fiction style, cculd be based analyzing a large subset (if not the whole class) of verbs called intransitiveas item S which can occur both with nc object (traditionally called intransitive verbs) and with one or two objects (traditionally called transitives). In such an analysis it is presumed that when the grammatical object of a verb of this class is either redun cant or not completely specified it is suppressed and 21 the result is a one-place predicate sentence, e.g., John sang. When the grammatical object carries new or requirea information it is present and the result is a multiple-place predicate, e.g., John sans a Greek fclksong. This sort of analysis cf the &amp;quot;intransitive&amp;quot; verb o.pens the door to a very of genre differences. Thus viewed, verbvariable characterizes sentences which are nct heavily infcrmaticn criented--sentences in which a major component, thE grammatical cbject, is either so cr that it is nct even specified. Such sentences are signific,antly more characteristdc of fiction than cf ncn-ficticn writing, and this analysis of them suggests a measurable basis for the cid rule of thumb successful (although not good) fiction wriiirg is strongly action oriented. It also suggests the validity of the ccmmon-sense intuition that a primary source of the differences between Liction and non-fiction is that the latter is designed foremost as an information-conveying instrument; that in the dichctdmy of literary purpose it is more likely tc teach than to delightc Since one of th:e major ways in which infcrmation can be packed into a sentence is through healiy use of nominal elements, we locked at a simple measure of thi characterization of fiction style as action-ariented as 22 opposed to non-fiction style as information-oriented: the verb/noun ratio for each genre. These ratios are Fiction . .416 Learned Journals Newspaper Reportage Popular Journals Government DocUments .264 .290 .3114 .241 tearing cut the supposition that sentences in the nonfiction genres have acre nouns in proportion to verbs than do those from fiction. It may also be noted that, in addition tc being high in nouns in proportion to verb, nonfiction sentences also exhibit somewhat more noun modification than fiction, as shown by the following ratios all noun-modifier types (variables 28, 30, 31, and 33) to nouns: FiCtion .431 Learned Journals Popular Journals Government Documents .577 .606 .545 . Thus, frcm the discriminatory variables identified by the five-group discriminant function analysis and the observations by them, a picture emenges of distinctive syntactic structure constellations in at least two major genre categories: fiction, with the syntactic structures determined by the function of Rast-time, actionoriented, narrative communication; and non-fiction, with structures determined by an information-carrying function. 23 discriminant function analysis showed such a majcr distinction between fiction and the non-fiction that possible that differences in the nonficticn genres might have been obscured. In ccnsequence, a four-&apos;group discriminant function analysis was done on data from these genres crly. The result indicated a distinctioE in syntactic structure between the formal genres (Learned Journals and Government Documents) ard the informal (Newspaper &apos;reportage and Popular Journals) alcng the first axis, and alcng the second axis a distinction between Popular Jcurnals and Newspaper Reportage. The third dimension distinguished Learned Journals from Government rocuments (see Figure 2). 5 shows the variables that participate These three discriminations. These structures present a less distinct picture cf different cf than dc differentiating fiction and non-ficticr, but nevertheless illustrate Ecme interesting pcint-s abcut genre and style.

Inclusion of direct discourse is present as of the tact tlat the parsiag ptocedure aid not differentiate between true direct diScourse cf the sort found in fiction dialogue and the quoted material of the sort found in Newspaper Reportage in which one or two words may be quoted. The Newspaper Reportage contributed this discripinant variable tc the informal category is borne out its appearance as a distinguishing that genre from Popular Journals, as shown by the second function in Table 5. formsare a typical and, frequently, a deliberate indicator of informal style, which probably explains the presence of this variable as a discriminator. addition, editorial (or a writer&apos;s perception of it) usnally discourages the use of these fcrms in any sort 27 of formal written language, which explains their absence in Iearhed Journals and Government DocuMents. Why 12.st tense should differentiate informal from formal non-fiction is not really clear; one possible contributory cause may b•hat Learned Journals frequently discuss things as they are (or to Government Documents (which in this are largely proclamations of future legal interpretations or holidays) discuss things as they will be, hut NewspapEr Reportage discusses things as they have beer. &apos;Several other transparent discriminatory variables are be seen in Table 5. Variable 8, constructions, which distinguishes Learned Journals from Government Documents, is almost certainly a result of conscious editorial policy. The presence of declarative sentences and the &apos;absence of im2erative sentencss which distinguish Newspaper Eeportage frcm Popular Journals are a joint result of the presence in PoEular Journals of a number of how-toarticles: &amp;quot;Hold the brick in your left hand •••,&amp;quot; A less transparent, but perhaps more analytically interesting set of variables is shown in gable 5 (32, 33, 26, and 24, 22, 33). The first three, Iartiilly reduced relativeclauses, ,noun adjuncts, and,advertial clauses, are atypical of informal non-fictioh in the informal/formal discrimination; the other three arE involved in 28 distinguishing Learhed Journals from GoVernffent Documents-rominalizations in the noun 211Lase and corjoined words and Ihrases by their presence in Learned OcUrnals and noun by its absence. (The activity of noun adjunctsas discriminatory by its absence in both of the informal genres and in Learned Journals indicates its heavy use in Government Dccumetts: &amp;quot;I, John Chaffee, Governor of Rhode All these structures are significantly characteristic of cne cr both cf the formal non-fiction genres, and all five are from the category cf conjoined or embedded syntactic elements—that is, syntactiC structures &apos;whose primary purpose is to compress and relate information within the sentence. Seemingly, thoSe gerres in which the author&apos;s intent is to convey maximum information with traximuu explicitness are just those that make maximum use of such syntactic techniques. (We note in tha,t, except for adverbial clauses and for conjoined words and which involve either of verbs, phrase-; the it signi-ficart element-s are members the noun appears that only at this level of genre ciscpiminaticn is anything but a verbal or whole-sentence slement a significant stylistic indicator.) 29 CONCLUSION ighat seeMs tc te evident from the above resu1t0 is that, while there are indeed significantly different patterns syntactic cccuirence between genres, these patterns (with the exception of editorially determired use of Eassive in Learned Journal and avoidance of verbalfcrms in any formal style) result primarily from general semantic constraints cperating within the genres and based in tle coamunicative purposes of the &apos;lc fiction, nc matter what its topic, is typically a narraticn cf past but interccnnectesd actions, and the syntactic structures that differentiate fiction from rcn-ficticr are ones which ccnvey this semantic content; again no matter what it abcut, is in general a data-ccnveying instrument, even tlough there are detectable differences in the manner in which the data are ecnveyed, e.g., degree of specificity cf data (Learned degree didacticism Journals), of narration (Newspaper Fepertage). Again, tnese bread semantic similarities and differences are in syntactic structures that differentiate the styles. supmary, quantitative differences in can indeed be fcund between sub-populations of (genres), but they appear tc ccrtespcnd tc--and are presumably the 30 result of—generic con,municative purposes cf the genres, and shoul4 ccrsequently be viewed as internally-constrainad artefacts of this semantic component rather than externallydefinEd elements cf style.</abstract>
