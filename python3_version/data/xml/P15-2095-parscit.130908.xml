In this article, we discuss the challenges of
document summarization for the blind and
visually impaired people and then propose
a new system called BrailleSUM to pro-
duce better summaries for the blind and
visually impaired people. Our system con-
siders the factor of braille length of each
sentence in news articles into the ILP-

results on a DUC dataset show that
BrailleSUM can produce shorter braille

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999967134328358">
People with normal vision can read news docu-
ments with their eyes conveniently. However, ac-
cording to WHO’s statistics, up to October 2013,
285 million people are estimated to be visually
impaired worldwide: 39 million are blind and 246
have low vision. Unfortunately, the large number
of blind and visually impaired people cannot di-
rectly or conveniently read ordinary news docu-
ments like sighted people, and they have to read
braille with their fingerprints or special equip-
ments, which brings much more burden to them.
Braille is a special system with a set of symbols
composed of small rectangular braille cells that
contain tiny palpable bumps called raised dots
used by the blind and visually impaired. It is tra-
ditionally written with embossed paper. Special
equipments such as refreshable braille displays
and braille embosser have been developed for the
blind and visually impaired people to read or print
on computers and other electronic supports.
Though some news materials have already been
prepared in braille format for the blind people’s
reading and learning, most daily news documents
are written for sighted people, and it is necessary
to first translate the news documents into Braille,
and then the blind people can read the news with
their fingertips. Speech synthesizers are also com-
monly used for the task (Freitas and Kouroupetro-
glou, 2008), but the way of reading braille texts is
still popular in the daily life of the blind people,
especially for the deaf-blind people.
As we know, document summarization is a very
useful means for people to quickly read and
browse news articles in the big data era. Existing
summarization systems focus on content quality
and fluency of summaries, and they usually ex-
tract several informative and diversified sentences
to form a summary with a given length. The sum-
maries are produced for sighted people, but not for
the blind and visually impaired people. A text
summary can be translated into a braille summary
for the blind and visually impaired people’s read-
ing, and the length of a braille summary is defined
as the number of the braille cells in the summary.
It is noteworthy that the shorter the braille sum-
mary is, the less burden the blind people have
when reading the summary with their fingertips.
The burden lies in the fact that reading a braille
text by touching each braille cell with fingertips is
more difficult and inconvenient than reading a
normal text with eyes. So a braille summary is re-
quired to be as short as possible, while keeping the
content quality and fluency.
In this study, we investigate the task of docu-
ment summarization for the blind and visually im-
paired people for the first time. We discuss the
major challenges of document summarization for
the blind and visually impaired people and then
propose a new system called BrailleSUM to pro-
duce better summaries for them. Our system con-
siders the factor of braille length of each sentence
in news articles into the ILP-based summarization
method. Evaluation results on a DUC dataset
show that BrailleSUM can produce much shorter
braille summaries than existing methods, mean-
while, it does not sacrifice the content quality of
the summaries.

ing sentences in a document set to form a sum-
mary. Typical methods include the centroid-based
method (Radev et al., 2004), NeATS (Lin and
Hovy, 2002), supervised learning based methods
(Ouyang et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2007; Schilder

(Gillick et al., 2008; Gillick and Favre, 2009; Li
et al., 2013), and submodular function (Lin and
Bilmes, 2010). Moreover, cross-language docu-
ment summarization has been investigated (Wan
et al., 2010), but the task focuses on how to select
the translated sentences with good content quality.
We can see that all existing summarization sys-
tems were proposed for sighted people, but not for
the blind and visually impaired people. Document
summarization for the blind and visually impaired
people has its specialty and is worth exploring.
It has been a long way to help the blind and vis-
ually impaired people to browse information as
conveniently as ordinary people. Special devices
have been developed for achieving this long-term
goal (Linvill and Bliss, 1966; Shinohara et al.,
1998). After the popularity of Braille, many kinds
of braille display devices have been developed for
braille reading (Rantala et al., 2009). In addition,
most research in this area focused on how to im-
prove accessibility of web information for the
blind people (Salampasis et al., 2005; Mahmud et
al., 2007; Hadjadj and Burger, 1999).

3 Preliminaries of Braille Grades

Braille is a system of raised dots arranged in cells
and it was developed by Louis Braille in the be-
ginning of the 19th century. Braille letters, com-
mon punctuation marks, and a few symbols are
displayed as raised 6 dot braille cell patterns read
by using a fingertip to feel the raised dots. The
number and arrangement of these raised dots
within a cell distinguish one character from an-
other. For example, the letters “a”, “b” and “c” are
displayed as , respectively. Due to the var-
ying needs of braille readers, there are different
grades of braille. In this study we adopt grade 2
braille – EBAE (English Braille America Edition).
Grade 2 braille was a space-saving alternative to
grade 1 braille. In grade 2 braille, a cell can repre-
sent a shortened form of a word. Many cell com-
binations have been created to represent common
words, making this the most popular of the grades
of braille. There are part-word contractions (e.g.
“stand” → , “without” → ), which often
stand in for common suffixes or prefixes, and
whole-word contractions (e.g. “every” → ,
“knowledge” → ), in which a single cell repre-
sents an entire commonly used word. Words may
be abbreviated by using a single letter to represent
the entire word, using a special symbol to precede
either the first or last letter of the word while trun-
cating the rest of the word, using a double-letter
contraction such as &amp;quot;bb&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cc&amp;quot;, or removing
most or all of the vowels in a word in order to
shorten it. A complex system of styles, rules, and
usage has been developed for this grade of braille.

<bodyText confidence="0.999967536585366">
The focus of traditional summarization tasks is
how to improve the content quality of a summary
with a given length limit, and the content quality
of a summary is measured by the overlap between
the summary and reference summaries written by
annotators. However, document summarization
for the blind and visually impaired people is dif-
ferent from traditional summarization tasks. Be-
sides the content quality, the length of a braille
summary is a very important factor to be consid-
ered, because the number of braille cells in a
braille summary have a direct impact on the blind
and visually impaired people when they read the
summary with their fingertips, and more highly
contracted braille is quicker to read, as shown in
previous studies such as (Veispak et al., 2012).
Given a document set, our new summarization
task aims to produce a braille summary, which are
translated from a traditional textual summary with
a predefined length (usually measured by the
count of words). The braille summary is required
to keep the content quality, measured by the con-
tent quality of the textual summary. Moreover, the
braille length of the summary is required to be as
short as possible. The length of a braille summary
is defined as the number of the rectangular braille
cells in the summary. The shorter the length is, the
blind and visually impaired people will spend less
time reading the summary with their fingertips
and thus the summary is better. For simplicity, we
define the braille length of a textual summary as
the length of its translated braille summary. For
example, the braille length of a text “hello, world!”
is 9 since the length of its translated braille text
is 9.
A basic solution to the new summarization task
is first applying an existing summarization algo-
rithm (e.g. the most popular ILP-based method) to
produce a summary, and then translating the sum-
mary into a braille summary, which is called Ba-
sicSUM. However, the braille translation is not a

simple character-to-block conversion process and
there exist various contractions during the transla-
tion process, as mentioned in the previous section.
Two content-similar sentences may be translated
into two braille sentences with totally different
lengths due to the different word lengths and con-
version contractions. Therefore, our solution is to
consider the new factor of braille length of each
sentence during the summarization process and
produce a summary with shorter braille length
while keeping its content quality. In our proposed
BrailleSUM system, we incorporate the factor of
braille length into the ILP-based summarization
framework with a new ILP formulation.

5 ILP-Based Braille Summarization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999847">
In this study, we adopt the popular ILP-based
summarization framework for addressing the new
task of braille summarization. The concept-based
ILP method for summarization is introduced by
(Gillick et al., 2008; Gillick and Favre, 2009), and
its goal is to maximize the sum of the weights of
the language concepts (i.e. bigrams) that appear in
the summary. The ILP method is very powerful
for extractive summarization because it can select
important sentences and remove redundancy at
the same time. Formally, the ILP method can be
represented as below:

cbi is the document frequency of bigram bi;
B is the set of unique bigrams;

Si is the set of sentences that contain bigram i.
N is the count of the sentences;
Lmax is the maximum word count of the summary,
which is set to 250 in the experiments;
li is the word count of sentence i.
Constraint (2) ensures that the total length of
the selected sentences is limited by the given
length limit. Inequalities (3)(4) associate the sen-
tences and bigrams. Constraint (3) ensures that se-
lecting a sentence leads to the selection of all the
bigrams it contains, and constraint (4) ensures that
selecting a bigram only happens when it is present
in at least one of the selected sentences.

The new objective function for braille summa-
rization consists of two parts: the original part re-
flecting the content quality and the new part re-
flecting the braille length factor. The function is
presented as below and the constraints are the
same with (2)(3)(4).
max{(1 − A) Z1B�1 c&amp;quot; ` + A Z&amp;quot; 1 braille_ratiojsj} �
where C = ZiEB cbi is a normalization constant to
make the values of the two parts in the equation
comparable. A E [0, 1] is a combination parame-
ter to reflect the different influences of the two
parts. braille_ratioj is a new factor to reflect the
suitability level of sentence j to be selected, which
is computed as below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99286">
braille_ratioj = til (6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995820411764706">
where blj is the braille length of sentence j, and it
is defined as the number of braille cells in the cor-
responding braille sentence. lj is the word count
in the original sentence. As mentioned earlier, the
number of characters and signs in an English sen-
tence is not equal to the number of the braille cells
in the corresponding braille sentence, since grade
2 braille is not based on a simple one-to-one con-
version from each character or sign to a braille cell.
In this study, we adopt the open-source libbraille1
tool for converting an English sentence into a
braille sentence, and then get the braille length of
the sentence. An example English sentence and its
corresponding braille sentence are shown below:
Infected feed cannot account for four cases.
We can see that the number of characters and
signs in the English sentence is 38, while the num-
ber of braille cells in the braille sentence is 26, and
thus the braille length blj is 26. We can also
simply know that the word count of the sentence
lj is 7. Thus the braille ratio of the sentence is
7/26=0.269. We can see that if a sentence has a
larger ratio of its word count to its braille length,
then it is more suitable to be selected. Particularly,
for two sentences with the same word count, the
one with a shorter braille length is preferred. Note
that since the sum of lj for the sentences in a sum-
mary is fixed, the sum of blj for the sentences
should be as small as possible in order to maxim-
ize the second part in Equation (5). For the new
objective function in Equation (5), the first part
ensures the content quality, and the second part
tries to make the braille length of the summary as
short as possible. The combination of the two

parts can achieve the two goals of our new sum-
marization task at the same time. If the combina-
tion parameter A is set to 0, then the formulation
in (5) is actually the same with (1).
Finally, we solve the above linear programming
problem by using the IBM CPLEX optimizer and
get the English summary according the value of
each variable 𝑠𝑗 . The corresponding braille sum-
mary can be produced after translation with lib-
braille.

In this study, we used the multi-document sum-
marization task in DUC2006 for evaluation.
DUC2006 provided 50 document sets and a sum-
mary with a length limit of 250 words was re-
quired to be created for each document set. Refer-
ence summaries have been provided by NIST an-
notators. For simplicity, the topic description was
ignored in this study. In the experiments, our pro-
posed BrailleSUM system with the new ILP
method in Equation (5) was compared with the
BasicSUM system with the traditional ILP
method in Equation (1). The parameter A in
BrailleSUM is simply set to 1/4 (i.e. 0.25).
Since the aim of our system is reducing the
braille length of a summary without sacrificing its
content quality, we evaluate the summaries from
the following two aspects: First, we evaluate the
content quality of the summaries by measuring the
content overlap between the summaries and the
reference summaries with the ROUGE-1.5.5
toolkit (Lin and Hovy, 2003). In this study, we
use three ROUGE recall scores in the experi-
mental results: ROUGE-1 (unigram-based),
ROUGE-2 (bigram-based) and ROUGE-SU4
(based on skip bigram with a maximum skip
distance of 4). Second, we compute the braille
length of each summary by summing the
braille lengths of all the sentences in the sum-
mary, and then average the lengths across the 50
document sets.
The comparison results on summary content
quality and average summary braille length are
shown in Table 1. We can see that BrailleSUM
and BasicSUM can achieve very similar ROUGE
scores, and the score differences are non-signifi-
cant because the 95% confidence intervals are
highly overlapped. The scores of BrailleSUM and
BasicSUM are much higher than that of the NIST
baseline and the average scores of all participating
systems (i.e. AverageDUC). More importantly,
BrailleSUM can produce summaries with much
shorter braille lengths than BasicSUM, and the
braille length reduction is significant. The results
demonstrate that BrailleSUM can produce much
shorter braille summaries while not sacrificing the
summaries’ content quality. We can see that the
incorporation of the braille length factor into the
ILP framework is very effective for addressing the
new summarization task.
In order to show the influence of parameter A in
BrailleSUM, we vary A from 0 to 1, and show the
curves of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, and
average braille length in Figures 1-3, respectively.
We can see that with the increase of A, the average
braille length of the produced summaries is de-
creasing steadily. The result can be easily ex-
plained by that a larger A means more considera-
tion of the braille length factor. We can also see
from the figures that when A is less than 0.3, the
ROUGE scores usually keep steady and do not de-
cline significantly, but when A is becoming larger,
the ROUGE scores decline obviously. The results
demonstrate that the content quality factor and the
braille length factor need to be balanced with a
proper value of A.

Evaluation results on a DUC dataset show that BrailleSUM can produce shorter braille summaries than existing methods, meanwhile, it does not sacrifice the content quality of the summaries.</abstract>

Special equipments such as refreshable braille displays and braille embosser have been developed for the blind and visually impaired people to read or print on computers and other electronic supports. Though some news materials have already been prepared in braille format for the blind people’s reading and learning, most daily news documents are written for sighted people, and it is necessary to first translate the news documents into Braille, and then the blind people can read the news with their fingertips. Speech synthesizers are also commonly used for the task (Freitas and Kouroupetroglou, 2008), but the way of reading braille texts is still popular in the daily life of the blind people, especially for the deaf-blind people. As we know, document summarization is a very useful means for people to quickly read and browse news articles in the big data era. Existing summarization systems focus on content quality and fluency of summaries, and they usually extract several informative and diversified sentences to form a summary with a given length. The summaries are produced for sighted people, but not for the blind and visually impaired people. A text summary can be translated into a brail</context>

Therefore, our solution is to consider the new factor of braille length of each sentence during the summarization process and produce a summary with shorter braille length while keeping its content quality. In our proposed BrailleSUM system, we incorporate the factor of braille length into the ILP-based summarization framework with a new ILP formulation. 5 ILP-Based Braille Summarization In this study, we adopt the popular ILP-based summarization framework for addressing the new task of braille summarization. The concept-based ILP method for summarization is introduced by (Gillick et al., 2008; Gillick and Favre, 2009), and its goal is to maximize the sum of the weights of the language concepts (i.e. bigrams) that appear in the summary. The ILP method is very powerful for extractive summarization because it can select important sentences and remove redundancy at the same time. Formally, the ILP method can be represented as below: maxZ1B1 cbibi subject to: � i�1 si G Lm.

In the experiments, our proposed BrailleSUM system with the new ILP method in Equation (5) was compared with the BasicSUM system with the traditional ILP method in Equation (1). The parameter A in BrailleSUM is simply set to 1/4 (i.e. 0.25). Since the aim of our system is reducing the braille length of a summary without sacrificing its content quality, we evaluate the summaries from the following two aspects: First, we evaluate the content quality of the summaries by measuring the content overlap between the summaries and the reference summaries with the ROUGE-1.5.5 toolkit (Lin and Hovy, 2003). In this study, we use three ROUGE recall scores in the experimental results: ROUGE-1 (unigram-based), ROUGE-2 (bigram-based) and ROUGE-SU4 (based on skip bigram with a maximum skip distance of 4). Second, we compute the braille length of each summary by summing the braille lengths of all the sentences in the summary, and then average the lengths across the 50 document sets. The comparison results on summary content quality and average summary braille length are shown in Table 1. We can see that BrailleSUM and BasicSUM can achieve very similar ROUGE scores, and the score differences are non-s</context>

However, document summarization for the blind and visually impaired people is different from traditional summarization tasks. Besides the content quality, the length of a braille summary is a very important factor to be considered, because the number of braille cells in a braille summary have a direct impact on the blind and visually impaired people when they read the summary with their fingertips, and more highly contracted braille is quicker to read, as shown in previous studies such as (Veispak et al., 2012). Given a document set, our new summarization task aims to produce a braille summary, which are translated from a traditional textual summary with a predefined length (usually measured by the count of words). The braille summary is required to keep the content quality, measured by the content quality of the textual summary. Moreover, the braille length of the summary is required to be as short as possible. The length of a braille summary is defined as the number of the rectangular braille cells in the summary. The shorter the length is, the blind and visually impaired people will spend less ti</context>
