1. Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999754434782609">
Despite being the oldest discipline in linguistics, phonology remains largely unex-
plored from a computational standpoint. While phonology gave us such innovations
as the &apos;distinctive feature,&apos; now heavily used in computational linguistics, phonology
itself has yet to reap the benefits of the formal and technological developments it gave
rise to.
Recently, however, computational phonology has been rapidly gaining recognition
as an independent area of inquiry within computational linguistics. The ACL Special
Interest Group in Computational Phonology (SIGPHON) was formed in 1991 and has
served as a focus for ongoing work in the area. In June of that year I proposed that there
be a special issue of Computational Linguistics dedicated to computational phonology,
since there were many good-quality papers in circulation that had no obvious venue
for publication. The resulting collection, which you have before you, is a representative
sample of this work; some submissions not ready in time for this volume will appear
in subsequent regular issues. Other work in this area is to be found in the Proceedings
of the First Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Phonology, published
by the ACL in 1994, and in two edited collections (Bird 1991; Ellison and Scobbie
1993).
The purpose of this short piece is to introduce computational phonology and the
special issue. I shall begin by presenting some background to the field, followed by
a survey of the research themes currently under investigation. Next, an overview of
the papers in this collection is given, concluding with an explanation of the one-
page commentaries that follow each paper. So, what is phonology, and why should
computational linguists care about it?

2. Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9986989">
Phonology is the study of the systems of sounds that are manifested by natural lan-
guages, the significant contrasts between sounds that are relevant to meaning. As such,
phonology stands at the interface between grammar, broadly construed, and speech.
Much of the richness and complexity of phonology derives from the place it occu-
pies between categorical symbolic systems and parametric physical behavior. Several
excellent textbooks are available for readers who wish to learn more about phonology.
Now, why should computational linguists care about phonology? First, phonology
is an equally valid area of study for a computational linguist as syntax or semantics.
Solutions in one area may generalize to other areas, as we see, for example, where
strings of segments are parsed using the same machinery that is used for syntactic

parsing (e.g. chart parsing [Church 1987]), or where a formal system developed for
semantic representations of tense is applied to the temporal structure of phonology
(Bird and Klein 1990), or where complex arrangements of phonological features are
represented in the familiar notation of attribute-value matrices (Wiese 1990). Thus,
phonology provides a fresh source of applications for the techniques and technologies
of computational linguistics.
However, this only demonstrates a flow of information from computational lin-
guistics to phonology. Can we hope for payoffs in the other direction resulting from a
wholesale integration of phonology into computational linguistics? It is instructive to
consider The Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky and Halle 1968) in this regard. Although
it was intended as a contribution to phonological theory, SPE was also directly im-
plementable on computer (e.g. Bobrow and Fraser&apos;s &apos;phonological rule tester,&apos; [19681),
and it was an important foundation for work in speech technology (e.g. Allen, Hunni-
cutt, and Klatt 1987). Via the work of Johnson (1972), Koskenniemi (1984), and Kaplan
and Kay—the latter in circulation since the early eighties but appearing in published
form for the first time in the present collection—one could reasonably argue that SPE
gave rise to finite-state morphology (Antworth 1990; Ritchie et al. 1992; Sproat 1992).
The formal framework of SPE was a good deal more explicit and rigorous than
most of what came after, and so the prospects for a repeat performance coming from
phonology have never been particularly bright. However, I feel it is now time for
computational linguists to take another look at phonology. A quarter of a century has
gone by since SPE, and there is much of interest to be found in the pages of Phonology
and similar publications. A good place to start is the literature on computational
phonology itself, since it interprets the theoretical proposals of phonology in a way that
is more accessible to computational linguists. The stakes are high, since it would not be
surprising if phonology is still to play an important role in bridging natural language
technology and speech technology. For even though there is a methodological and
sociological divide, there remains an imperative to develop fully integrated language
and speech systems and an enduring need for fresh sources of creative ideas to relate
the discrete to the continuous.
Undoubtedly, there will always remain sceptics who think that natural language
systems that deal just with the written word can afford to ignore phonology. In a
limited sense they are correct. However, in the longer term, I am convinced that the
interest in multilingual and multimodal systems will require a more enlightened view
of phonology. Many languages have genuinely phonological phenomena evident in
the orthography, such as Finnish (Koskenniemi 1984). Even in English we find cases
where a spelling rule needs to be sensitive to phonological information. For example,
the orthographic rule that selects a vs. an breaks down when a following word begins
with a written vowel but a spoken consonant or vice versa, as in a uranium compound
and an ytterbium compound. Although it largely works for English and a handful of
other languages, the assumption that phonology can be ignored by natural language
systems will collapse for many of the world&apos;s languages (e.g. Finnish, Turkish, and
Arabic).
One reason why computational phonology has not had a high profile is that work
in this area has often been dealt with under the heading of computational morphology.
However, much of what passes as finite-state morphology is actually morphophonol-
ogy—the phonological factors that influence the appearance of morphemes—or even
phonology proper. Moreover, the central computational device in finite-state morphol-
ogy, the finite-state transducer, is not used for specifying the distribution of morphemes
(i.e. morphotactics), the other main task of morphology. Therefore, that part of finite-
state morphology that is expressed in terms of finite-state transducers, namely mor-
iv
Steven Bird Introduction to Computational Phonology
phophonology and phonology, is largely coextensive with the domain of SPE. Perhaps
the appearance of Kaplan and Kay&apos;s paper in this collection is symbolic of the recogni-
tion that there is a close interplay between computational morphology and phonology
A second reason that attention to phonology is warranted is that much of phonol-
ogy is actually not subsumed by computational morphology and speech technology.
In general, work in these two fields has focused on SPE-style phonology alone and
has not, by and large, connected with current phonological theory or addressed purely
phonological concerns. Again, computational phonology should provide usable imple-
mentations of more recent models so that they can be incorporated into computational
work on morphology and speech.
Finally, one might reasonably ask why a phonologist ought to be interested in
computational phonology. At the most obvious level, computational phonology should
provide support for developing theories and testing them against data, removing some
of the hackwork involved in achieving formal and empirical adequacy Additionally,
computational phonology may be able to provide formal devices that are useful in
phonology proper, as in the case of the information-theoretic evaluation metric (Ellison
1993) that is intended to replace the naïve symbol-counting version. One can also ob-
serve that phonology has its own divide between theoreticians who work on abstract
models supported by small collections of data drawn from a wide variety of languages,
and investigators working on large scale analyses of individual languages (such as the
work of the Summer Institute of Linguistics on the orthographies of approximately
1,100 languages [D. Crozier, personal communicationp. To this observer, it seems like
there could be more communication of new data from the field phonologist to the the-
oretical phonologist and, in the reverse direction, communication of new hypotheses
and useful theoretical devices that would play an active part in the search for inter-
esting new data. It seems plausible that computational systems that let phonologists
experiment with large amounts of data and a variety of theoretical models have an
important part to play in bridging the gap between the &apos;theory people&apos; and the &apos;data
people.&apos;

3. Research Themes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.84175075862069">
I have attempted to identify four strands of work and cite a representative sample of
work within each. Unfortunately, much valuable, relevant work has had to be omitted
from the citation lists below for reasons of space.
Formal reconstruction and language-theoretic results. Work in this area seeks
to provide coherent and well-understood formal frameworks in which phonological
theories can be expressed. Some work takes an existing theory as its starting point
and seeks to refine it and express it in increasing levels of formality, while other work
begins from an existing formalism and tries to adapt its expressive capabilities to the
needs of phonology Since most work contains a mixture of both, I shall not attempt
a classification. Rather, I shall loosely classify a selection of the work based on the
formal method used: unification (Carson 1988; Chung 1990; Coleman 1991; Scobbie
1991; Broe 1993; Walther 1993), predicate logic (Bird 1990; Bouma 1991; Russell 1993),
modal logic (Bird and Blackburn 1991; Calder and Bird 1991), type theory (Klein
1991; Mastroianni 1993), categorial grammar/logic (Wheeler 1981; Dogil 1984; van der
Linden 1991; Oehrle 1991; Steedman 1991; Moortgat and Morrill to appear), finite-state
devices (Kay 1987; Kornai 1991; Wiebe 1992; Bird and Ellison 1994), electrical circuitry
(Gilbers 1992), and formal language theory (Ristad 1990; Kornai 1991; Ritchie 1992;
Wiebe 1992).
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 3
This work addresses phonological theories such as autosegmental, metrical, under-
specification, and government phonology. The paper by Kaplan and Kay in this col-
lection is another example of work in this general vein.
Implementations. Work in this area is directed at producing computer programs
that can be used by phonologists to develop and test theories. A variety of SPE im-
plementations exist (independently of the finite-state transducer model) starting from
Bobrow and Fraser (1968) and including models for applying rules in reverse (Bear
1990; Maxwell 1991). Other theoretical frameworks that have been implemented to
a greater or lesser extent include lexical phonology (Williams 1991), autosegmen-
tal phonology (Bird 1990; Albro 1994; Bird and Ellison 1994), diachronic phonology
(Hewson 1974; Eastlack 1977; Lowe and Mazaudon 1989), inheritance-based models
(Daelemans 1987; Reinhard and Gibbon 1991) and connectionist models (see the next
paragraph on learning). The paper by Lowe and Mazaudon in this collection is an
example of other work under the heading of implementations.
Automatic learning. This work aims to provide models to (i) simulate human
behavior and test of theories of human language acquisition, and (ii) provide the
working phonologist with useful generalizations about a certain body of data under
study. Examples of the first type are (Lathroum 1989; Touretzky and Wheeler 1993;
Gupta and Touretzky 1992; Hare 1990; Gasser and Lee 1990; Gasser 1992; Shillcock
et al. 1992; Goldsmith 1993; Larson 1992), and these all use connectionist models.
Examples of the second type are all symbolic (Johnson 1984; Dresher and Kaye 1990;
Ellison 1993; Bird 1994). Daelemans, Gillis, and Durieux have contributed a paper to
the present collection that fits into this category of automatic learning.
Interfacing to grammar and speech. The final grouping contains work that is
intended to integrate computational models of phonology with computational models
of grammar and of speech. Concerning the phonology-grammar interface, all this work
is covered under the paragraph on formal reconstruction above. The assumption is
that if phonological models are formalized and if they employ the same computational
model as is used for computational syntax and semantics, then interfacing to grammar
ought to be relatively straightforward. Another instance of this work is the contribution
to the present collection by Bird and Klein. Recent work on integrating phonology with
speech synthesis includes Hertz (1990), Coleman (1992), and Dirksen (1992), and there
is also a large literature on the phonology of intonation as it relates to synthesis (e.g.
Anderson, Pierrehumbert, and Liberman 1984; Ladd 1987).
This concludes the discussion of the various current research themes in compu-
tational phonology. As chance would have it, each of these themes is manifested by
one of the papers in the present collection. We now go on to survey these papers
briefly. The reader is referred to the commentaries for more detailed overviews of the
contributions.

Kaplan and Kay: Regular Models of Phonological Rule Systems. Kaplan and Kay
have finally provided the &amp;quot;widely cited but notoriously unpublished work&amp;quot; (Ritchie
et al. 1992:20) that establishes the mathematical foundation for finite-state computa-
tional phonology and morphology. This is without question the flagship paper of this
collection.

diachronic linguistics, known as the comparative method, for comparing word forms
taken from cognate languages in order to reconstruct aspects of the ancestor language
from which the languages are derived. The system is applied to data from a group of

Daelemans, Gillis, and Durieux: The Acquisition of Stress: A Data-Oriented Approach.
This paper consists of a rather striking demonstration that an empiricist learning model
actually performs better than the nativist &apos;Principles and Parameters&apos; approach, con-
cerning the task of assigning primary stress to a corpus of around 5,000 Dutch words.
Bird and Klein: Phonological Analysis in Typed Feature Systems. This contribution
shows how a model of phonology incorporating complex multi-tiered structures can
be integrated with a constraint-based grammar of the HPSG variety. Applications to
nonconcatenative morphology in Sierra Miwok and deletion in French are given.

5. Commentaries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888428571429">
The commentaries were conceived as a way of involving more people in the special
issue, and of identifying, for each paper, the noteworthy achievements and remaining
areas of contention. I felt that this would add interest and perspective to the collection
and would enable outsiders to gain a deeper insight into the workings of the field.
Two commentators were selected for each paper who have an established reputation
for work in the same area of specialization as the paper in question, and who, in some
cases, hold contrary views to those being advanced by the authors.

Thus, phonology provides a fresh source of applications for the techniques and technologies of computational linguistics. However, this only demonstrates a flow of information from computational linguistics to phonology. Can we hope for payoffs in the other direction resulting from a wholesale integration of phonology into computational linguistics? It is instructive to consider The Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky and Halle 1968) in this regard. Although it was intended as a contribution to phonological theory, SPE was also directly implementable on computer (e.g. Bobrow and Fraser&apos;s &apos;phonological rule tester,&apos; [19681), and it was an important foundation for work in speech technology (e.g. Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt 1987). Via the work of Johnson (1972), Koskenniemi (1984), and Kaplan and Kay—the latter in circulation since the early eighties but appearing in published form for the first time in the present collection—one could reasonably argue that SPE gave rise to finite-state morphology (Antworth 1990; Ritchie et </context>

Other work in this area is to be found in the Proceedings of the First Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Phonology, published by the ACL in 1994, and in two edited collections (Bird 1991; Ellison and Scobbie 1993). The purpose of this short piece is to introduce computational phonology and the special issue. I shall begin by presenting some background to the field, followed by a survey of the research themes currently under investigation. Next, an overview of the papers in this collection is given, concluding with an explanation of the onepage commentaries that follow each paper.

Can we hope for payoffs in the other direction resulting from a wholesale integration of phonology into computational linguistics? It is instructive to consider The Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky and Halle 1968) in this regard. Although it was intended as a contribution to phonological theory, SPE was also directly implementable on computer (e.g. Bobrow and Fraser&apos;s &apos;phonological rule tester,&apos; [19681), and it was an important foundation for work in speech technology (e.g. Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt 1987). Via the work of Johnson (1972), Koskenniemi (1984), and Kaplan and Kay—the latter in circulation since the early eighties but appearing in published form for the first time in the present collection—one could reasonably argue that SPE gave rise to finite-state morphology (Antworth 1990; Ritchie et al. 1992; Sproat 1992). The formal framework of SPE was a good deal more explicit and rigorous than most of what came after, and so the prospects for a repeat performance coming from phonology have never been particularly bright. However, I feel it is now time for computational linguists to take another look at phonology. A quarter of a century has </context>

Undoubtedly, there will always remain sceptics who think that natural language systems that deal just with the written word can afford to ignore phonology. In a limited sense they are correct. However, in the longer term, I am convinced that the interest in multilingual and multimodal systems will require a more enlightened view of phonology. Many languages have genuinely phonological phenomena evident in the orthography, such as Finnish (Koskenniemi 1984). Even in English we find cases where a spelling rule needs to be sensitive to phonological information. For example, the orthographic rule that selects a vs. an breaks down when a following word begins with a written vowel but a spoken consonant or vice versa, as in a uranium compound and an ytterbium compound. Although it largely works for English and a handful of other languages, the assumption that phonology can be ignored by natural language systems will collapse for many of the world&apos;s languages (e.g. Finnish, Turkish, and Arabic). One reason why computational phonology has not had a hig</context>

Examples of the first type are (Lathroum 1989; Touretzky and Wheeler 1993; Gupta and Touretzky 1992; Hare 1990; Gasser and Lee 1990; Gasser 1992; Shillcock et al. 1992; Goldsmith 1993; Larson 1992), and these all use connectionist models. Examples of the second type are all symbolic (Johnson 1984; Dresher and Kaye 1990; Ellison 1993; Bird 1994). Daelemans, Gillis, and Durieux have contributed a paper to the present collection that fits into this category of automatic learning. Interfacing to grammar and speech. The final grouping contains work that is intended to integrate computational models of phonology with computational models of grammar and of speech. Concern</context>

Thus, phonology provides a fresh source of applications for the techniques and technologies of computational linguistics. However, this only demonstrates a flow of information from computational linguistics to phonology. Can we hope for payoffs in the other direction resulting from a wholesale integration of phonology into computational linguistics? It is instructive to consider The Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky and Halle 1968) in this regard. Although it was intended as a contribution to phonological theory, SPE was also directly implementable on computer (e.g. Bobrow and Fraser&apos;s &apos;phon</context>

Work in this area is directed at producing computer programs that can be used by phonologists to develop and test theories. A variety of SPE implementations exist (independently of the finite-state transducer model) starting from Bobrow and Fraser (1968) and including models for applying rules in reverse (Bear 1990; Maxwell 1991). Other theoretical frameworks that have been implemented to a greater or lesser extent include lexical phonology (Williams 1991), autosegmental phonology (Bird 1990; Albro 1994; Bird and Ellison 1994), diachronic phonology (Hewson 1974; Eastlack 1977; Lowe and Mazaudon 1989), inheritance-based models (Daelemans 1987; Reinhard and Gibbon 1991) and connectionist models (see the next paragraph on learning).
