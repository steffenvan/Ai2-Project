This paper presents a two-stage approach to
summarizing multiple contrastive viewpoints
in opinionated text. In the first stage, we
use an unsupervised probabilistic approach to
model and extract multiple viewpoints in text.
We experiment with a variety of lexical and
syntactic features, yielding significant perfor-
mance gains over bag-of-words feature sets.
In the second stage, we introduce Compara-
tive LexRank, a novel random walk formula-
tion to score sentences and pairs of sentences
from opposite viewpoints based on both their
representativeness of the collection as well as
their contrastiveness with each other. Exper-
imental results show that the proposed ap-
proach can generate informative summaries of
viewpoints in opinionated text.

The amount of opinionated text available online has
been growing rapidly, increasing the need for sys-
tems that can summarize opinions expressed in such
text so that a user can easily digest them. In this pa-
per, we study how to summarize opinionated text in
a such a way that highlights contrast between multi-
ple viewpoints, which is a little-studied task.
Usually, online opinionated text is generated by
multiple people, and thus often contains multi-
ple viewpoints about an issue or topic. A view-
point/perspective refers to “a mental position from
which things are viewed” (cf. WordNet). An opin-
ion is usually expressed in association with a partic-
ular viewpoint, even though the viewpoint is usually

not explicitly given; for example, a blogger that is
in favor of a policy would likely look at the positive
aspects of the policy (i.e., positive viewpoint), while
someone against the policy would likely empha-
size the negative aspects (i.e., negative viewpoint).
Moreover, in an opinionated text with diverse opin-
ions, the multiple viewpoints taken by opinion hold-
ers are often “contrastive”, leading to opposite po-
larities. Indeed, such contrast in opinions may be a
main driving force behind many online discussions.
Futhermore, opinions regarding news events and
other short-term issues may quickly emerge and dis-
appear. Such opinions may reflect many differ-
ent types of viewpoints which cannot be modeled
by current systems. For this reason, we believe
that a viewpoint summarization system would ben-
efit from the ability to extract unlabeled viewpoints
without supervision. Even if such clustering has in-
accuracies, it could still be a useful starting point for
human editors to select representative excerpts.
Thus, given a set of opinionated documents about
a topic, we aim at automatically extracting and sum-
marizing the multiple contrastive viewpoints implic-
itly expressed in the opinionated text to facilitate
digestion and comparison of different viewpoints.
Specifically, we will generate two types of multi-
view summaries: macro multi-view summary and
micro multi-view summary. A macro multi-view
summary would contain multiple sets of sentences,
each representing a different viewpoint; these differ-
ent sets of sentences can be compared to understand
the difference of multiple viewpoints at the “macro
level.” A micro multi-view summary would con-
tain a set of pairs of contrastive sentences (each pair

consists of two sentences representing two different
viewpoints), making it easy to understand the differ-
ence between two viewpoints at the “micro level.”
Although opinion summarization has been exten-
sively studied (e.g., (Liu et al., 2005; Hu and Liu,
2004; Hu and Liu, 2006; Zhuang et al., 2006)), ex-
isting work has not attempted to generate our envi-
sioned contrastive macro and micro multi-view sum-
maries in an unsupervised way, which is the goal of
our work. For example, Hu and Liu (2006) rank sen-
tences based on their dominant sentiment according
to the polarity of adjectives occuring near a product
feature in a sentence. A contradiction occurs when
two sentences are highly unlikely to be simultane-
ously true (cf. (Marneffe et al., 2008)). Although
little work has been done on contradiction detection,
there are a few notable approaches (Harabagiu et al.,
2006; Marneffe et al., 2008; Kim and Zhai, 2009).
The closest work to ours is perhaps that of Ler-
man and McDonald (2009) who present an approach
to contrastive summarization. They add an objective
to their summarization model such that the summary
model for one set of text is different from the model
for the other set. The idea is to highlight the key
differences between the sets, however this is a dif-
ferent type of contrast than the one we study here –
our goal is instead to make the summaries similar to
each other, to contrast how the same information is
conveyed through different viewpoints.
In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach
to solving this novel summarization problem, which
will be explained in the following two sections.

2 Modeling Viewpoints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999655">
The first challenge to be solved in order to generate
a contrastive summary of multiple viewpoints is to
model and extract these viewpoints which are hidden
in text. In this paper we propose to solve this chal-
lenge by employing the Topic-Aspect Model (TAM)
(Paul and Girju, 2010), which is an extension of the
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al.,
2003) for jointly modeling topics and viewpoints in
text. While most existing work on such topic models
(including TAM) has taken a topic model as a gen-
erative model for word tokens in text, we propose to
take TAM as a generative model for more complex
linguistic features extracted from text. These are
more discriminative than single word tokens and can
improve the accuracy of extracting multiple view-
points as we will show in the experimental results’
section. Below we first give a brief introduction to
TAM and then present the proposed set of features.

2.1 Topic-Aspect Model (TAM)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969487804878">
LDA-style probabilistic topic models of document
content (Blei et al., 2003) have been shown to offer
state-of-the-art summarization quality. Such mod-
els also provide a framework for adding additional
structure to a summarization model (Haghighi and
Vanderwende, 2009). In our case, we want to add
more structure to a model to incorporate the notion
of viewpoint/perspective into our summaries.
When it comes to extracting viewpoints, recent re-
search suggests that it may be beneficial to model
both topics and perspectives, as sentiment may be
expressed differently depending on the issue in-
volved (Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Paul and Girju,
2010). For example, let’s consider a set of product
reviews for a home theater system. Content topics
in this data might include things like sound qual-
ity, usability, etc., while the viewpoints might be
the positive and negative sentiments. A word like
speakers, for instance depends on the sound topic
but not a viewpoint, while good would be an exam-
ple of a word that depends on a viewpoint but not
any particular topic. A word like loud would depend
on both (since it would be considered positive senti-
ment only in the context of the sound quality topic),
while a word like think depends on neither.
We make use of a recent model, the Topic-Aspect
Model (Paul and Girju, 2010), which can model
such behavior with or without supervision. Under
this model, a document has a mixture over topics as
well as a mixture over viewpoints. The two mix-
tures are drawn independently of each other, and
thus can be thought of as two separate clustering di-
mensions. A word is associated with variables de-
noting its topic and viewpoint assignments, as well
as two binary variables to denote if the word de-
pends on the topic and if the word depends on the
viewpoint. A word may depend on the topic, the
viewpoint, both, or neither, as in the above example.
The generative process for a document d under
this model can be briefly described as follows. For
each word in a document:

<listItem confidence="0.999182875">
1. Sample a topic z from P(z|d) and a viewpoint v
from P(v|d).
2. Sample a “level” B E 10, 11 from P(B|d). This
determines if the word will depend on the topic (topical
level) or not (background level).
3. Sample a “route” r E 10, 11 from P(r|B, z). This
determines if the word will depend on the viewpoint.
4. Sample a word w from P(w|z, v, r, B).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961931034483">
The probabilities are multinomial/binomial dis-
tributions with Dirichlet/Beta priors, and thus this
model falls under the standard LDA framework. The
number of topics and number of viewpoints are pa-
rameters that must be specified. Inference can be
done with Gibbs sampling (Paul and Girju, 2010).
TAM naturally gives us a very rich output to
use in a viewpoint summarization application. If
we are doing unsupervised viewpoint extraction,
we can use the output of the model to compute
P(v|sentence) which could be used to generate
summaries that contain only excerpts that strongly
highlight one viewpoint over another. Similarly,
we could use the learned topic mixtures to generate
topic-specific summaries. Futhermore, the variables
r and B tell us if a word is dependent on the view-
point and topic, and we could use this information
to focus on sentences that contain informative con-
tent words. Note that without supervision, TAM’s
clustering is based only on co-occurrences and the
patterns it captures may or may not correspond with
the viewpoints we wish to extract. Nonetheless, we
show in this research that it can indeed find mean-
ingful viewpoints with reasonable accuracy on cer-
tain data sets. Although we do not explore this in
this paper, additional information about the view-
points could be added to TAM by defining priors on
the distributions to further improve the accuracy of
viewpoint discovery.

2.2 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998519909090909">
Previous work with TAM used only bag of words
features, which may not be the best features for cap-
turing viewpoints. For example, “Israel attacked
Palestine” and “Palestine attacked Israel” are iden-
tical excerpts in an exchangable bag of words rep-
resentation, yet one is more likely to come from the
perspective of a Palestinian and the other from an Is-
raeli. In this subsection, we will propose a variety of
feature sets. We evaluate the utility of these features
to the task of modeling viewpoints by measuring the
accuracy of unsupervised clustering.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.885712">
2.2.1 Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959">
We have experimented with simple bag of words
features as baseline approaches, both with and with-
out removing stop words, and found that the accu-
racy of clustering by viewpoint is better when re-
taining all words. This supports the observation
that common function words may have important
psychological properties (Chung and Pennebaker,
2007). Thus, we do not do any stop word removal
for any of our other feature sets. We find that we get
better results by stemming the words, so we apply
Porter’s stemmer to all of our features described.

2.2.2 Dependency Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999211611111111">
It has been shown that using syntactic information
can improve the accuracy of sentiment models (Joshi
and Ros´e, 2009). Thus, instead of representing doc-
uments as a bag of words, we will experiment with
using features returned by a dependency parser. For
this, we used the Stanford parser1, which returns de-
pendency tuples of the form rel(a, b) where rel is
some dependency relation and a and b are tokens of
a sentence. We can use these specific tuples as fea-
tures, referred here as the full-tuple representation.
One problem with this representation is that we
are using very specific information and it is harder
for learning algorithms to find patterns due to the
lack of redundancy. One solution is to generalize
these features and rewrite a tuple rel(a, b) as two
tuples: rel(a, *) and rel(*, b) (Greene and Resnik,
2009; Joshi and Ros´e, 2009). We will refer to this as
the split-tuple representation.

2.2.3 Negation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959111111111">
If a word wi appears in the head of a neg rela-
tion, then we would like this to be reflected in other
dependency tuples in which wi occurs. For a tuple
rel(wi, wj), if either wi or wj is negated, then we
simply rewrite it as -,rel(wi, wj).
An alternative would be to rewrite the individual
word wi as -,wi. However in our experiments this
representation produced worse accuracies, perhaps
because this produces less redundancy.

2.2.4 Polarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825823529412">
We also hypothesize that lexical polarity informa-
tion may improve our model. If we are using the
full-tuple representation, then a tuple becomes more
general by replacing the specific word with a + or
−. In the case that both words are polarity words,
we use two tuples, replacing only one word at a
time rather than replacing both words with their po-
larity signs. To determine the polarity of a word,
we simply use the Subjectivity Clues lexicon (Wil-
son et al., 2005) and as polarity values, positive (+),
negative (-), and neutral (*). Under our split-tuple
representation, this becomes more specific by re-
placing the ∗ with the polarity sign. For example,
the tuple amod(idea, good) would be represented
as amod(idea, +) and amod(∗, good). We collapse
negated features to flip the polarity sign such that
¬rel(a, +) becomes rel(a, −).

2.2.5 Generalized Relations

<bodyText confidence="0.9999715">
We also experimented with backing off the rela-
tions themselves. Since the Stanford dependencies
can be organized in a hierarchy2, we will represent
the relations at more generalized levels in the hi-
erarchy. For example, both a direct object and an
indirect object are a type of object. For a relation
rel, we define Rrel as the relation above rel in
the hierarchy – for example, Rdobj = obj. We
make an exception for neg which has its own im-
portant properties that we wish to retain, so we let
Rneg = neg. Thus, when using these features, we
rewrite rel(a, b) as Rrel(a, b).

3 Multi-Viewpoint Summarization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996553">
As a computation problem, extractive multi-
viewpoint summarization would take as input a set
of candidate excerpts3 X = {x1,x2, ..., x|X|} with
k viewpoints and generate two types of multi-view
contrastive summaries: 1) A macro contrastive sum-
mary Smacro consists of k disjoint sets of excerpts,
X1, X2,..., Xk ⊂ X with each Xi containing repre-
sentative sentences of the i-th view (i.e., Smacro =
(X1,..., Xk)). The number of excerpts in each Xi
can be empirically set based on application needs.

pendencies manual (Marneffe and Manning, 2008).
3An “excerpt” refers to the smallest unit of text that will
make up our summary such as a sentence.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.993073444444444">
2) A micro contrastive summary Smicro consists
of a set of excerpt pairs, each containing two ex-
cerpts from two different viewpoints, i.e., Smicro =
{(s1, t1), ..., (sr,,, t,,,)} where si ∈ X and ti ∈ X are
two comparable excerpts representing two different
viewpoints. n is the length of the summary, which
can be set empirically based on application needs.
Note that both macro and micro summaries can re-
veal contrast between different viewpoints, though
at different granularity levels.
To generate macro and micro summaries based
on the probabilistic assignment of excerpts to view-
points given by TAM, we propose a novel extension
to the LexRank algorithm (Erkan and Radev, 2004),
a graph-based method for scoring representative ex-
cerpts to be used in a summary. Our key idea is to
modify the definition of the jumping probability in
the random walk model so that it would favor ex-
cerpts that represent a viewpoint well and encour-
age jumping to an excerpt comparable with the cur-
rent one but from a different viewpoint. As a re-
sult, the stationary distribution of the random walk
model would capture representative contrastive ex-
cerpts and allow us to generate both macro and mi-
cro contrastive summaries within a unified frame-
work. We now describe this novel summarization
algorithm (called Comparative LexRank) in detail.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998978">
3.1 Comparative LexRank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995818181818">
LexRank is a PageRank-like algorithm (Page et al.,
1998), where we define a random walk model on
top of a graph that has sentences to be summarized
as nodes and edges placed between two sentences
that are similar to each other. We can then score
all the sentences based on the expected probability
of a random walker visiting each sentence. We use
the short-hand P(xj|xi) to denote the probability of
being at node xj at a time t given that the walker
was at xi at time t − 1. The jumping probability
from node xi to node xj is given by:

<equation confidence="0.996165">
P(xj  |xi) = Ej,EX s � m(xi, xj,) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998826">
where sim is a content similarity function defined
on two sentence/excerpt nodes.
Our extension is mainly to modify this jumping
probability in two ways so as to favor visiting con-
trastive representative opinions from multiple view-

points. The first modification is to make it favor
jumping to a good representative excerpt x of any
viewpoint v (i.e., with high probability p(v|x) ac-
cording to the TAM model). The second modifica-
tion is to further favor jumping between two excerpts
that can potentially form a good contrastive pair for
use in generating a micro contrastive summary.
Specifically, under our model, the random walker
first decides whether to jump to a sentence of the
same viewpoint or to a sentence of a different view-
point. We define this decision as a binary variable
z E 10, 11. Intuitively, if we can force the ran-
dom walker to move back and forth between view-
points, then the final scores will favor sentences that
are similar across both viewpoints.
We define two different modified similarity func-
tions for the two possible values of z. The first one,
simo (corresponding to z = 0) scales the similarity
by the likelihood that the two x’s represent the same
viewpoint, and the second one, simi (for z = 1)
scales the similarity by the likelihood that the x’s
come from different viewpoints.

where P(v|x) denotes the probability that the ex-
cerpt x belongs to the viewpoint v, and in general,
can be obtained through any multi-viewpoint model.
A special case of this is when the labels for view-
points are known, in which case P(v|x) = 1 for the
correct label and 0 for the others.
In our experiments, P(v|x) comes from the out-
put of TAM, and we define sim(xi, xj) as the cosine
between the vectors xi and xj, although again any
similarity function could be used. The conditional
transition probability from xi to xj given z is then:

The stationary distribution of the random walk
gives us a scoring of the excerpts to be used in our
summary. It is also possible to score pairs of ex-
cerpts that contrast each other. We define the score
for a pair (xi, xj) as the probability of being at xi
and transitioning to xj or vice versa, where xi and
xj are of opposite viewpoints. Specifically:

3.2 Summary Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968578947368">
The final summary should be a set of excerpts that
have a high relevance score according to our scoring
algorithm, but are not redundant among each other.
Many techniques could be used to accomplish this
(Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; McDonald, 2007),
but we use a simple greedy approach: at each step
of the summary generation algorithm, we add the
excerpt with the highest relevance score as long as
the excerpt’s redundancy score – the cosine similar-
ity between the candidate and the current summary
– is under some threshold S. This is repeated until
the summary reaches a user-supplied length limit.
Macro contrastive summarization: A macro-level
summary consists of independent summaries for
each viewpoint, which we generate by first using the
random walk stationary distribution across all of the
data to rank the excerpts. We then separate the top-
ranked excerpts into two disjoint sets according to
their viewpoint based on whichever gives a greater
value of P(v|x), and finally remove redundancy and
produce the summary according to our method de-
scribed above. We refer to this as macro contrastive
summarization, because the summaries will contrast
each other in that they have related content, but the
excerpts in the summaries are not explicitly aligned
with each other.
Micro contrastive summarization: A candidate
excerpt for a micro-level summary will consist of
a pair (xi, xj) with the pairwise relevance score de-
fined in Equation 3. We can then rank these pairs and
remove redundancy. It is possible that both xi and xj
in a high-scoring pair may belong to the same view-
point; such a case would be filtered out since we are
mainly interested in including contrastive pairs in
our summary. We refer to this as micro contrastive
summarization, because the summaries will allow
us to see contrast at the level of individual excerpts
from different viewpoints.

4.1 Experimental Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986">
Evaluation of multi-view summarization is challeng-
ing as there is no existing data set we can use. We
leverage the resources on the Web and created two
data sets in the domain of political opinion.
Our first dataset is a set of 948 verbatim responses
to a Gallup ® phone survey about the 2010 U.S.
healthcare bill (Jones, 2010), conducted March 4-7,
2010. Responses in this set tend to be short and of-
ten incomplete or otherwise ill-formed and informal
sentences. Respondants indicate if they are ‘for’ or
‘against’ the bill, and there is a roughly even mix of
the two viewpoints (45% for and 48% against).
We also use the Bitterlemons corpus, a collection
of 594 editorials about the Israel-Palestine conflict.
This dataset is fully described in (Lin et al., 2006)
and has been used in other perspective modeling lit-
erature (Lin et al., 2008; Greene and Resnik, 2009).
The style of this data differs substantially from the
healthcare data in that documents in this set tend to
be long and verbose articles with well-formed sen-
tences. It again contains a fairly even mixture of two
different perspectives: 312 articles from Israeli au-
thors and 282 articles from Palestinian authors.
Moreover, for the healthcare data set, manually
extracted opinion polls are available on the Web,
which we further leverage to construct gold stan-
dard summaries to evaluate our method quantita-
tively. The data and test sets are available at
http://apfel.ai.uiuc.edu/resources.html.

4.2 Stage One: Modeling Viewpoints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969596774194">
The main research question we want to answer in
modeling viewpoints is whether richer feature sets
would lead to better accuracy than word features.
We used our various feature sets as input to TAM
and measured the accuracy of clustering documents
by viewpoint. This evaluation serves both to mea-
sure how accurately this type of clustering can be
done, as well as to measure which types of features
are important for modeling viewpoints.
We found that the clustering accuracy is improved
if we measure the accuracy of only the subset of
documents such that P(vldoc) is greater than some
threshold (we used 0.8). Thus, the accuraries pre-
sented in this section are measured using this confi-
dence threshold. We will use this approach for the
summarization task as well, as it ensures we are only
summarizing documents where we have high confi-
dence about their viewpoint membership.
There are several parameters to set for TAM.
Since our focus is on comparing linguistic features
with word features, we simply set these parame-
ters to some reasonable values: We used Dirich-
let pseudo-counts of 80.0 for P(E = 0), 20.0 for
P(E = 1), uniform pseudo-counts of 5.0 for P(x),
0.1 for the topic and aspect mixtures, and 0.01 for
the word distributions. We tell the model to use 2
viewpoints as well as 5 topics for the healthcare cor-
pus and 8 topics for the Bitterlemons corpus.
There is high variance in the accuracies depend-
ing on how the Gibbs samplers were initialized. We
thus repeated the experiments many times to obtain
relatively confident measures – 200 times for the
healthcare set and 50 times for the Bitterlemons set,
with 2000 iterations each time. A natural way to se-
lect a model is to choose the model that gives the
highest likelihood to its input. To evaluate how well
this selection strategy would work, we measured the
correlation between accuracy and likelihood.
The results are shown in Table 1. We can make
several observations. (1) In all cases, the proposed
linguistic features yield higher accuracy than the
word features, supporting our hypothesis that for
viewpoint modeling, applying TAM to these features
improves performance over using simple word fea-
tures. Since virtually all existing work on topic mod-
els assumes word tokens as data to be modeled, our
results suggest that it would be interesting to explore
applying generative topic models to complex fea-
tures for other tasks as well. This may be because by
adding additional complex features to the observed
data, we artificially inflate the data likelihood to em-
phasize modeling co-occurrences of such features,
which effectively biases the model to capture a cer-
tain perspective of co-occurrences.
(2) The increase is substantially greater for the
Bitterlemons corpus, which may be due to the fact
that the parsing accuracy is likely better because the
language is formal. The split-tuple representation
is very significantly better for the healthcare corpus,
but it is not clear which is better for the Bitterlemons
corpus. It is also not clear how the generalized rela-
tions affect the performance.

(3) It appears that adding polarity helps the full-
tuple features (by making them more general) but
hurts the split-tuple features (by making them more
specific). Negation significantly improves the full-
tuple features in the Bitterlemons corpus, but it is
not clear if it helps in the other cases. It should be
noted that capturing negation and polarity is a very
complex and difficult task, and it is not expected that
our simple approaches will accurately capture these

asked 3 annotators to identify contrastive pairs in
the “main reasons” table described above. Each pair
must contain one reason from the ‘for’ side and one
reason from the ’against’ side, though we do not re-

pairs that were identified as being contrastive by at
least 2 annotators to be our gold set of contrastive
pairs. Because these pairs come from the gold sum-
mary, they are still representative of the collection as
a whole, rather than fine-grained contrasts.
The macro reference set contains 9 ‘for’ reasons
and 15 ‘against’ reasons. The micro reference set
contains 13 annotator-identified pairs composed of 9
unique ‘for’ reasons and 8 unique ‘against’ reasons.

Model-based algorithms: We will also compare
against the approach of Lerman and McDonald
(2009) who introduce their contrastiveness objective
into a model-based summarization algorithm. The
basic form of this algorithm is to select a set of sen-
tences Sm to minimize the KL-divergence between
the models of the summary Sm and the entire collec-
tion Xm for a viewpoint m. The objective function
is: − Em_1 KL(L(Sm)||L(Xm)) where L is an ar-
bitrary language model. We define L(A) simply as
the unigram distribution over words in the collection
A, a method also evaluated by Haghighi and Vander-
wende (2009). This is the fairest comparison to our
LexRank experiments, where sentences are also rep-
resented as unigrams. (We do not do any modeling
with TAM in our quantitative evaluation.)
Lerman and McDonald introduce an additional
term to maximize the KL-divergence between the
summary of one viewpoint and the collection of the
opposite viewpoint, so that each viewpoint’s sum-
mary is dissimilar to the other viewpoints. We bor-
row this idea but instead do the opposite so that the
viewpoints’ summaries are more (rather than less)
similar to each other. This contrastive version of our
model-based baseline is formulated as:

Our summary generation algorithm is to iteratively
add excerpts to the summary in a greedy fash-
ion, selecting the excerpt with the highest score in
each iteration. Note that this approach only gen-
erates macro-level summaries, leaving us with the
LexRank baseline for micro-level summaries.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.931039">
4.3.3 Metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999529227272727">
We will evaluate our summaries using a variant of
the standard ROUGE evaluation metric (Lin, 2004).
Recall that we have two different evaluation sets
– one that contains all of the reasons for each view-
point, and one that consists only of aligned pairs of
excerpts. Since the same excerpt may appear in mul-
tiple pairs, there would be significant redundancy in
our reference summary if we were to include every
pair. Thus, we will restrict a contrastive reference
summary to exclude overlapping pairs, and we will
have many reference sets for all possible combina-
tions of pairs. There is only one reference set for the
representativeness criterion.
Our reference summaries have a unique property
in that the summaries have already been annotated
with the prominence of the different reasons in the
data. A good summary should capture the more
prominent statements, so we will include this in our
scoring function. We thus augment the basic ROUGE
n-gram recall score by weighting the n-gram counts
in the reference summary according to this percent-
age. This is a generalization of the standard ROUGE
formula where this percentage would be uniform.
For evaluating the macro-level summaries, we
will score the summaries for the two viewpoints sep-
arately, given a reference set Refi and a candidate
summary Ci for a viewpoint v = i. The final score
is a combination of the scores for both viewpoints,
i.e. Sr,p = 0.5S(Refi, Ci)+0.5S(Refj, Cj) where
S(Ref, C) is our ROUGE-based scoring metric. It
would also be interesting to measure how well a
viewpoint’s summary matches the gold summary
of the opposite viewpoint, which will give insights
into how well the Comparative LexRank algorithm
makes the two summaries similar to each other. We
will measure this as the inverse of the above metric,
i.e. Sopp = 0.5S(Refi, Cj) + 0.5S(Refj, Ci).
Finally, to score the micro-level comparative sum-
maries (recall that this gives explicitly-aligned pairs
of excerpts), we will concatenate each pair (xi, xj)
as a single excerpt, and use these as the excerpts in
our reference and candidate summaries. The scor-
ing function is then Sp = S(Refpairs,Cpairs). Note
that we have multiple reference summaries for the

4.3.4 Evaluation Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995456521739">
In order to evaluate our Comparative LexRank
algorithm by itself, in this subsection we will not
use the output of TAM as part of our summariza-
tion input, and will assign excerpts fixed values of
P(v|x) = 1 for the correct label and 0 otherwise.
We constructed our sentence vectors with unigrams
(removing stop words) and no IDF weighting.
We set the PageRank damping factor (Erkan and
Radev, 2004) to 0.01 and tried combinations of
the redundancy threshold 6 E 10.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.21
with different values of A, the parameter which con-
trols the level of contrastiveness. For each value of
A, we optimized 6 on the original data set according
to Srep X Sopp so that we can directly compare these
scores, and then we tuned 6 separately for Sp. The
summary length is 6 excerpts. To obtain more ro-
bust results, we repeated the experiment 100 times
on random half-size subsets of our data. The scores
shown in Table 3 are averaged across these trials.
In general, increasing A increases Srep, which
suggests that tuning A behaves as expected, and
high- and mid-range A values indeed produce sum-
maries where the summaries of the two viewpoints
are more similar to each other. Similarly, mid-range
A values produce substantially higher values of Sp-1,
the unigram ROUGE scores for the micro contrastive
summary, although there is not a large difference be-
tween the bigram scores. An example of our micro-
level output is shown in Table 4.
As for our model-based baseline, we show results
for both the basic algorithm (denoted MB) in addi-
tion to the contrastive modification (denoted MC).
We see that the contrastive modification behaves
as expected and produces much higher scores for
Sopp, however, this method does not outperform our
LexRank algorithm. It is interesting to note that in
almost all cases where a contrastive objective is in-
troduced, the scores for the opposite viewpoint Sopp
increase without decreasing the Srep scores, sug-
gesting that contrastiveness can be introduced into a
multi-view summarization problem without dimin-
ishing the overall quality of the summary. It is
admittedly difficult to make generalizations about
these methods from experiments with only one data
set, but we have at least some evidence that our al-
gorithm works as intended.

4.4 Unsupervised Summarization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990461538462">
So far we have focused on evaluating our viewpoint
clustering models and our multi-view summariza-
tion algorithms separately. We will finally show how
these two stages might work in tandem in unsuper-
vised summarization of the Bitterlemons corpus.
Without a gold set, it is difficult to perform an
extensive automatic evaluation as we did with the
healthcare data. Instead we will perform a sim-
ple qualitative evaluation to see if the algorithm ap-
pears to achieve its goal. Thus, we asked 8 people
to guess if each viewpoint’s summary was written
by Israeli or Palestinian authors. To diversify the
summaries, for each annotator we randomly split
each summary into two equal-sized subsets of the
sentence set. Thus each person was asked to label
four different summaries, which were presented in
a random order. If humans can correctly identify
the viewpoints, then this would suggest both that the
TAM accurately clustered documents by viewpoint
and the summarization algorithm is selecting sen-
tences that coherently represent the viewpoints.
We first ran TAM on our data using the same pro-
cedure and parameters as in Subsection 4.2 using the
full-tuple features. We repeated this 10 times and
used the model that gave the highest data likelihood
as our model for summarization input. We then gen-

erated macro contrastive summaries of our data for
the two viewpoints with 6 sentences per viewpoint.
We used unigram sentence vectors with IDF weight-
ing. We used A = 0.5 and 6 = 0.1, which gave the
highest score at this A value on the healthcare data.
Only one of these sentences was clustered incor-
rectly by TAM. The human judges correctly labeled
78% of the summary sets, suggesting that our sys-
tem accurately selected some sentences that could
be recognized as belonging to the viewpoints, but
is not perfect. Unsupervised micro-level summaries
were less coherent. Many of the sentences are mis-
labeled, and the ones that are correctly labeled are
not representative of the collection.
This is not surprising, and indeed exposes the
challenge inherent in our problem definition: clus-
tering documents based on similarity and then high-
lighting sentences with high similarity but opposite
cluster membership are almost conflicting objectives
for an unsupervised learner. Such contrastive pairs
are perhaps the most difficult data points to model.
A good test of a viewpoint model may be whether it
can capture the nuanced properties of the viewpoints
needed to contrast them at the micro level.

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999795">
The properties of the text which we attempt to sum-
marize in our work are related to the concept of
framing from political science (Chong and Druck-
man, 2010), which is defined as “an interpretation or
evaluation of an issue, event, or person that empha-
sizes certain of its features or consequences” focus-
ing on “certain features and implications of the issue
– rather than others.” For example, someone in favor
of the healthcare bill might focus on the benefits and
someone against the bill might focus on the cost.
However, our approach is different in that our
contrastive objective encourages the summaries to
include each point as addressed by all viewpoints,
rather than each viewpoint selectively emphasizing
only certain points. In a sense, this makes our sum-
mary more like a live debate, where one side must
directly respond to a point raised by the other side.
For example, someone in favor of healthcare reform
might cite the high cost of the current system, but
someone against this might counter-argue that the
proposed system in the new bill has its own high
costs (as seen in the last row of Table 4). The idea is
to show how both sides address the same issues.
Thus, we can say that we are summarizing the
key arguments/issues/points from different opinions.
Futhermore, our models and algorithms are defined
very generally, and while we tested their viability in
the domain of political opinion, they may also be
useful for many other comparative tasks.
In conclusion, we have presented steps toward a
two-stage system that can automatically extract and
summarize viewpoints in opinionated text. First, we
have shown that accuracy of clustering documents
by viewpoint can be enhanced by using simple but
rich dependency features. This can be done within
the framework of existing probabilistic topic models
without altering the models simply by using a “bag
of features” representation of documents.
Second, we have introduced Comparative
LexRank, an extension of the LexRank algorithm
that aims to generate contrastive summaries both at
the macro and micro level. The algorithm presented
is general enough that it can be applied to any
number of viewpoints, and can accomodate input
where the viewpoints are either given fixed labels,
or given probabilistic assignments. The tradeoff
between contrast and representation can flexibly be
tuned to an application’s needs.

<abstract confidence="0.998274055555556">This paper presents a two-stage approach to summarizing multiple contrastive viewpoints in opinionated text. In the first stage, we use an unsupervised probabilistic approach to model and extract multiple viewpoints in text. We experiment with a variety of lexical and syntactic features, yielding significant performance gains over bag-of-words feature sets. the second stage, we introduce Comparaa novel random walk formulation to score sentences and pairs of sentences from opposite viewpoints based on both their representativeness of the collection as well as their contrastiveness with each other. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can generate informative summaries of viewpoints in opinionated text.</abstract>

In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to solving this novel summarization problem, which will be explained in the following two sections. 2 Modeling Viewpoints The first challenge to be solved in order to generate a contrastive summary of multiple viewpoints is to model and extract these viewpoints which are hidden in text. In this paper we propose to solve this challenge by employing the Topic-Aspect Model (TAM) (Paul and Girju, 2010), which is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003) for jointly modeling topics and viewpoints in text. While most existing work on such topic models (including TAM) has taken a topic model as a generative model for word tokens in text, we propose to take TAM as a generative model for more complex linguistic features extracted from text. These are more discriminative than single word tokens and can improve the accuracy of extracting multiple viewpoints as we will show in the experimental results’ section. Below we first give a brief introduction to TAM and then present the proposed set of features. 2.1 Topic-Aspect Model (TAM) LDA-style probab</context>

Such models also provide a framework for adding additional structure to a summarization model (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009). In our case, we want to add more structure to a model to incorporate the notion of viewpoint/perspective into our summaries. When it comes to extracting viewpoints, recent research suggests that it may be beneficial to model both topics and perspectives, as sentiment may be expressed differently depending on the issue involved (Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Paul and Girju, 2010). For example, let’s consider a set of product reviews for a home theater system. Content topics in this data might include things like sound quality, usability, etc., while the viewpoints might be the positive and negative sentiments. A word like speakers, for instance depends on the sound topic but not a viewpoint, while good would be an example of a word that depends on a viewpoint but not any particular topic. A word like loud would depend on both (since it would be considered positive sentiment only in the context of the sound quality topic), while a word like think</context>

It is also possible to score pairs of excerpts that contrast each other. We define the score for a pair (xi, xj) as the probability of being at xi and transitioning to xj or vice versa, where xi and xj are of opposite viewpoints. Specifically: P(xi)P(xj|xi, z = 1) + P(xj)P(xi|xj, z = 1) (3) 3.2 Summary Generation The final summary should be a set of excerpts that have a high relevance score according to our scoring algorithm, but are not redundant among each other. Many techniques could be used to accomplish this (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; McDonald, 2007), but we use a simple greedy approach: at each step of the summary generation algorithm, we add the excerpt with the highest relevance score as long as the excerpt’s redundancy score – the cosine similarity between the candidate and the current summary – is under some threshold S. This is repeated until the summary reaches a user-supplied length limit. Macro contrastive summarization: A macro-level summary consists of independent summaries for each viewpoint, which we generate by first using the random walk stationary distribution across all of the data to rank the excerpts.

Such contrastive pairs are perhaps the most difficult data points to model. A good test of a viewpoint model may be whether it can capture the nuanced properties of the viewpoints needed to contrast them at the micro level. 5 Discussion The properties of the text which we attempt to summarize in our work are related to the concept of framing from political science (Chong and Druckman, 2010), which is defined as “an interpretation or evaluation of an issue, event, or person that emphasizes certain of its features or consequences” focusing on “certain features and implications of the issue – rather than others.” For example, someone in favor of the healthcare bill might focus on the benefits and someone against the bill might focus on the cost. However, our approach is different in that our contrastive objective encourages the summaries to include each point as addressed by all viewpoints, rather than each viewpoint selectively emphasizing only certain points.

In this subsection, we will propose a variety of feature sets. We evaluate the utility of these features to the task of modeling viewpoints by measuring the accuracy of unsupervised clustering. 2.2.1 Words We have experimented with simple bag of words features as baseline approaches, both with and without removing stop words, and found that the accuracy of clustering by viewpoint is better when retaining all words. This supports the observation that common function words may have important psychological properties (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007). Thus, we do not do any stop word removal for any of our other feature sets. We find that we get better results by stemming the words, so we apply Porter’s stemmer to all of our features described. 2.2.2 Dependency Relations It has been shown that using syntactic information can improve the accuracy of sentiment models (Joshi and Ros´e, 2009). Thus, instead of representing documents as a bag of words, we will experiment with using features returned by a dependency parser. For this, we used the Stanford parser1, which returns dependency tuples of the form rel(a, b) where rel is some dependency</context>

Note that both macro and micro summaries can reveal contrast between different viewpoints, though at different granularity levels. To generate macro and micro summaries based on the probabilistic assignment of excerpts to viewpoints given by TAM, we propose a novel extension to the LexRank algorithm (Erkan and Radev, 2004), a graph-based method for scoring representative excerpts to be used in a summary. Our key idea is to modify the definition of the jumping probability in the random walk model so that it would favor excerpts that represent a viewpoint well and encourage jumping to an excerpt comparable with the current one but from a different viewpoint. As a result, the stationary distribution of the random walk model would capture representative contrastive excerpts and allow us to generate both macro and micro contrastive summaries within a unified framework.

We constructed our sentence vectors with unigrams (removing stop words) and no IDF weighting. We set the PageRank damping factor (Erkan and Radev, 2004) to 0.01 and tried combinations of the redundancy threshold 6 E 10.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.21 with different values of A, the parameter which controls the level of contrastiveness. For each value of A, we optimized 6 on the original data set according to Srep X Sopp so that we can directly compare these scores, and then we tuned 6 separately for Sp. The summary length is 6 excerpts. To obtain more robust results, we repeated the experiment 100 times on random half-size subsets of our data. The scores shown in Table 3 are averaged across these trials. In general, increasing A increases Srep, which sug</context>

For this, we used the Stanford parser1, which returns dependency tuples of the form rel(a, b) where rel is some dependency relation and a and b are tokens of a sentence. We can use these specific tuples as features, referred here as the full-tuple representation. One problem with this representation is that we are using very specific information and it is harder for learning algorithms to find patterns due to the lack of redundancy. One solution is to generalize these features and rewrite a tuple rel(a, b) as two tuples: rel(a, *) and rel(*, b) (Greene and Resnik, 2009; Joshi and Ros´e, 2009). We will refer to this as the split-tuple representation. 2.2.3 Negation If a word wi appears in the head of a neg relation, then we would like this to be reflected in other dependency tuples in which wi occurs. For a tuple rel(wi, wj), if either wi or wj is negated, then we simply rewrite it as -,rel(wi, wj). An alternative would be to rewrite the individual word wi as -,wi. However in our experiments this representation produced worse accuracies, perhaps because this produces less redundancy. 1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/ 68 2.2.4 Polarity We also hypothesize th</context>

Respondants indicate if they are ‘for’ or ‘against’ the bill, and there is a roughly even mix of the two viewpoints (45% for and 48% against). We also use the Bitterlemons corpus, a collection of 594 editorials about the Israel-Palestine conflict. This dataset is fully described in (Lin et al., 2006) and has been used in other perspective modeling literature (Lin et al., 2008; Greene and Resnik, 2009). The style of this data differs substantially from the healthcare data in that documents in this set tend to be long and verbose articles with well-formed sentences. It again contains a fairly even mixture of two different perspectives: 312 articles from Israeli authors and 282 articles from Palestinian authors. Moreover, for the healthcare data set, manually extracted opinion polls are available on the Web, which we further leverage to construct gold standard summaries to evaluate our method quantitatively.

The basic form of this algorithm is to select a set of sentences Sm to minimize the KL-divergence between the models of the summary Sm and the entire collection Xm for a viewpoint m. The objective function is: − Em_1 KL(L(Sm)||L(Xm)) where L is an arbitrary language model. We define L(A) simply as the unigram distribution over words in the collection A, a method also evaluated by Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009). This is the fairest comparison to our LexRank experiments, where sentences are also represented as unigrams. (We do not do any modeling with TAM in our quantitative evaluation.) Lerman and McDonald introduce an additional term to maximize the KL-divergence between the summary of one viewpoint and the collection of the opposite viewpoint, so that each viewpoint’s summary is dissimilar to the other viewpoints. We borrow this idea but instead do the opposite so that the viewpoints’ summaries are more (rather than less) similar to each other. This contrastive version of our model-based baseline </context>

It is also possible to score pairs of excerpts that contrast each other. We define the score for a pair (xi, xj) as the probability of being at xi and transitioning to xj or vice versa, where xi and xj are of opposite viewpoints. Specifically: P(xi)P(xj|xi, z = 1) + P(xj)P(xi|xj, z = 1) (3) 3.2 Summary Generation The final summary should be a set of excerpts that have a high relevance score according to our scoring algorithm, but are not redundant among each other. Many techniques could be used to accomplish this (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; McDonald, 2007), but we use a simple greedy approach: at each step of the summary generation algorithm, we add the excerpt with the highest relevance score as long as the excerpt’s redundancy score – the cosine similarity between the candidate and the current summary – is under some threshold S. This is repeated until the summary reaches a user-supplied length limit.

We now describe this novel summarization algorithm (called Comparative LexRank) in detail. 3.1 Comparative LexRank LexRank is a PageRank-like algorithm (Page et al., 1998), where we define a random walk model on top of a graph that has sentences to be summarized as nodes and edges placed between two sentences that are similar to each other. We can then score all the sentences based on the expected probability of a random walker visiting each sentence. We use the short-hand P(xj|xi) to denote the probability of being at node xj at a time t given that the walker was at xi at time t − 1. The jumping probability from node xi to node xj is given by: P(xj |xi) = Ej,EX s � m(xi, xj,) (1) where sim is a content similarity function defined on two sentence/excerpt nodes.</context>

In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to solving this novel summarization problem, which will be explained in the following two sections. 2 Modeling Viewpoints The first challenge to be solved in order to generate a contrastive summary of multiple viewpoints is to model and extract these viewpoints which are hidden in text. In this paper we propose to solve this challenge by employing the Topic-Aspect Model (TAM) (Paul and Girju, 2010), which is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003) for jointly modeling topics and viewpoints in text. While most existing work on such topic models (including TAM) has taken a topic model as a generative model for word tokens in text, we propose to take TAM as a generative model for more complex linguistic features extracted from text. These are more discriminative than single word tokens and can improve the accuracy of extracting multiple viewpoints as we will show in the experimental results’ section. Below we first give a brief introduction to TAM an</context>

Such models also provide a framework for adding additional structure to a summarization model (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009). In our case, we want to add more structure to a model to incorporate the notion of viewpoint/perspective into our summaries. When it comes to extracting viewpoints, recent research suggests that it may be beneficial to model both topics and perspectives, as sentiment may be expressed differently depending on the issue involved (Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Paul and Girju, 2010). For example, let’s consider a set of product reviews for a home theater system. Content topics in this data might include things like sound quality, usability, etc., while the viewpoints might be the positive and negative sentiments. A word like speakers, for instance depends on the sound topic but not a viewpoint, while good would be an example of a word that depends on a viewpoint but not any particular topic. A word like loud would depend on both (since it would be considered positive sentiment only in the context of the sound quality topic), while a word like think depends on neither. We</context>

This determines if the word will depend on the topic (topical level) or not (background level). 3. Sample a “route” r E 10, 11 from P(r|B, z). This determines if the word will depend on the viewpoint. 4. Sample a word w from P(w|z, v, r, B). The probabilities are multinomial/binomial distributions with Dirichlet/Beta priors, and thus this model falls under the standard LDA framework. The number of topics and number of viewpoints are parameters that must be specified. Inference can be done with Gibbs sampling (Paul and Girju, 2010). TAM naturally gives us a very rich output to use in a viewpoint summarization application. If we are doing unsupervised viewpoint extraction, we can use the output of the model to compute P(v|sentence) which could be used to generate summaries that contain only excerpts that strongly highlight one viewpoint over another. Similarly, we could use the learned topic mixtures to generate topic-specific summaries. Futhermore, the variables r and B tell us if a word is dependent on the viewpoint and topic, and we could use this information to focus on sentences that contain informative content word</context>

If we are using the full-tuple representation, then a tuple becomes more general by replacing the specific word with a + or −. In the case that both words are polarity words, we use two tuples, replacing only one word at a time rather than replacing both words with their polarity signs. To determine the polarity of a word, we simply use the Subjectivity Clues lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005) and as polarity values, positive (+), negative (-), and neutral (*). Under our split-tuple representation, this becomes more specific by replacing the ∗ with the polarity sign. For example, the tuple amod(idea, good) would be represented as amod(idea, +) and amod(∗, good). We collapse negated features to flip the polarity sign such that ¬rel(a, +) becomes rel(a, −). 2.2.5 Generalized Relations We also experimented with backing off the relations themselves.
