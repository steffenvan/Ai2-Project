It is claimed that a variety of facts concerning ellip-
sis, event reference, and interclausal coherence can be
explained by two features of the linguistic form in ques-
tion: (1) whether the form leaves behind an empty
constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the form
is anaphoric in the semantics. It is proposed that these
features interact with one of two types of discourse in-
ference, namely Common Topic inference and Coherent
Situation inference. The differing ways in which these
types of inference utilize syntactic and semantic repre-
sentations predicts phenomena for which it is otherwise
difficult to account.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908806451613">
Ellipsis is pervasive in natural language, and hence has
received much attention within both computational and
theoretical linguistics. However, the conditions under
which a representation of an utterance may serve as
a suitable basis for interpreting subsequent elliptical
forms remain poorly understood; specifically, past at-
tempts to characterize these processes within a single
traditional module of language processing (e.g., consid-
ering either syntax, semantics, or discourse in isolation)
have failed to account for all of the data. In this paper,
we claim that a variety of facts concerning ellipsis res-
olution, event reference, and interclausal coherence can
be explained by the interaction between the syntactic
and semantic properties of the form in question and the
type of discourse inference operative in establishing the
coherence of the antecedent and elided clauses.
In the next section, we introduce the facts concerning
gapping, VP-ellipsis, and non-elliptical event reference
that we seek to explain. In Section 3, we categorize
elliptical and event referential forms according to two
features: (1) whether the expression leaves behind an
empty constituent in the syntax, and (2) whether the
expression is anaphoric in the semantics. In Section 4
we describe two types of discourse inference, namely
Common Topic inference and Coherent Situation in-
ference, and make a specific proposal concerning the
interface between these and the syntactic and seman-
tic representations they utilize. In Section 5, we show
how this proposal accounts for the data presented in
Section 2. We contrast the account with relevant past
work in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.

It has been noted in previous work that the felicity of
certain forms of ellipsis is dependent on the type of co-
herence relationship extant between the antecedent and
elided clauses (Levin and Prince, 1982; Kehler, 1993b).
In this section we review the relevant facts for two such
forms of ellipsis, namely gapping and VP-ellipsis, and
also compare these with facts concerning non-elliptical
event reference.
Gapping is characterized by an antecedent sentence
(henceforth called the source sentence) and the elision of
all but two constituents (and in limited circumstances,
more than two constituents) in one or more subsequent
target sentences, as exemplified in sentence (1):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.826672">
(1) Bill became upset, and Hillary angry.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.951626941176471">
We are concerned here with a particular fact about gap-
ping noticed by Levin and Prince (1982), namely that
gapping is acceptable only with the purely conjunc-
tive symmetric meaning of and conjoining the clauses,
and not with its causal asymmetric meaning (para-
phraseable by &amp;quot;and as a result&amp;quot;). That is, while either
of sentences (1) or (2) can have the purely conjunctive
reading, only sentence (2) can be understood to mean
that Hillary&apos;s becoming angry was caused by or came
as a result of Bill&apos;s becoming upset.
(2) Bill became upset, and Hillary became angry.
This can be seen by embedding each of these examples
in a context that reinforces one of the meanings. For
instance, gapping is felicitous in passage (3), where con-
text supports the symmetric reading, but is infelicitous
in passage (4) under the intended causal meaning of
and.&apos;

similar distinction holds between symmetric and asymmet-
ric uses of or and but. See Kehler (1994) for further discus-
sion.

The Clintons want to get the national debate fo-
cussed on health care, and are getting annoyed
because the media is preoccupied with Whitewa-
ter. When a reporter recently asked a Whitewater
question at a health care rally, Bill became upset,
and Hillary became/0 angry.

(4) Hillary has been getting annoyed at Bill for his in-
ability to deflect controversy and do damage con-
trol. She has repeatedly told him that the way
to deal with Whitewater is to play it down and
not to overreact. When a reporter recently asked
a Whitewater question at a health care rally, Bill
became upset, and (as a result) Hillary became/#

<bodyText confidence="0.968266571428572">
The common stipulation within the literature stating
that gapping applies to coordinate structures and not
to subordinate ones does not account for why any co-
ordinated cases are unacceptable.
VP-ellipsis is characterized by an initial source sen-
tence, and a subsequent target sentence with a bare
auxiliary indicating the elision of a verb phrase:

<bodyText confidence="0.999936714285714">
The distribution of VP-ellipsis has also been shown
to be sensitive to the coherence relationship extant be-
tween the source and target clauses, but in a differ-
ent respect. In a previous paper (Kehler, 1993b), five
contexts for VP-ellipsis were examined to determine
whether the representations retrieved are syntactic or
semantic in nature. Evidence was given that VP-ellipsis
copies syntactic representations in what was termed
parallel constructions (predicting the unacceptability of
the voice mismatch in example (6) and nominalized
source in example (8)), but copies semantic represen-
tations in non-parallel constructions (predicting the ac-
ceptability of the voice mismatch in example (7) and
the nominalized source in example (9)):2

These examples are analogous with the gapping cases in
that constraints against mismatches of syntactic form
hold for the symmetric (i.e., parallel) use of and in
examples (6) and (8), but not the asymmetric (i.e.,
non-parallel) meaning in examples (7) and (9). In

fact, it appears that gapping is felicitous in those con-
structions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic an-
tecedent, whereas gapping is infelicitous in cases where
VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent.
Past approaches to VP-ellipsis that operate within a
single module of language processing fail to make the
distinctions necessary to account for these differences.
Sag and Hankamer (1984) note that while elliptical
sentences such as (6) are unacceptable because of a
voice mismatch, similar examples with non-elided event
referential forms such as do it are much more accept-
able:
(10) The decision was reversed by the FBI, and the
ICC did it too. [ reverse the decision]
An adequate theory of ellipsis and event reference must
account for this distinction.
In sum, the felicity of both gapping and VP-ellipsis
appears to be dependent on the type of coherence re-
lation extant between the source and target clauses.
Pronominal event reference, on the other hand, appears
not to display this dependence. We seek to account for
these facts in the sections that follow.

In this section we characterize the forms being ad-
dressed in terms of two features: (1) whether the form
leaves behind an empty constituent in the syntax, and
(2) whether the form is anaphoric in the semantics. In
subsequent sections, we show how the distinct mecha-
nisms for recovering these types of missing information
interact with two types of discourse inference to predict
the phenomena noted in the previous section.
We illustrate the relevant syntactic and semantic
properties of these forms using the version of Catego-
rial Semantics described in Pereira (1990). In the Mon-
tagovian tradition, semantic representations are com-
positionally generated in correspondence with the con-
stituent modification relationships manifest in the syn-
tax; predicates are curried. Traces are associated with
assumptions which are subsequently discharged by a
suitable construction. Figure 1 shows the representa-
tions for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve
as the initial source clause representation for the exam-
ples that follow.3
For our analysis of gapping, we follow Sag (1976) in
hypothesizing that a post-surface-structure level of syn-
tactic representation is used as the basis for interpreta-
tion. In source clauses of gapping constructions, con-
stituents in the source that are parallel to the overt con-
stituents in the target are abstracted out of the clause
representation.4 For simplicity, we will assume that

&apos;We will ignore the tense of the predicates for ease of
exposition.

trastive accent is generally placed on parallel elements in

this abstraction is achieved by fronting the constituents
in the post-surface-structure, although nothing much
hinges on this; our analysis is compatible with several
possible mechanisms. The syntactic and semantic rep-
resentations for the source clause of example (1) after
fronting are shown in Figure 2; the fronting leaves trace
assumptions behind that are discharged when combined
with their antecedents.

Target clauses in gapping constructions are therefore
represented with the overt constituents fronted out of
an elided sentence node; for instance the representation
of the target clause in example (1) is shown in Figure 3
both the target and the source clauses, and that abstracting
these elements results in an &amp;quot;open proposition&amp;quot; that both
clauses share (Sag, 1976; Prince, 1986; Steedman, 1990).
This proposition needs to be presupposed (or accommo-
dated) for the gapping to be felicitous, for instance, it would
be infelicitous to open a conversation with sentence such as
(1), whereas it is perfectly felicitous in response to the ques-
tion How did the Clintons react?. Gapping resolution can
be characterized as the restoration of this open proposition
in the gapped clause.

stituent is reconstructed by copying the embedded sen-
tence from the source to the target clause, along with
parallel trace assumptions which are to be bound within
the target. The semantics for this embedded sentence
is the open proposition that the two clauses share. This
semantics, we claim, can only be recovered by copying
the syntax, as gapping does not result in an indepen-
dently anaphoric expression in the semantics.6 In fact,
as can be seen from Figure 3, before copying takes place
there is no sentence-level semantics for gapped clauses
at all.
Like gapping, VP-ellipsis results in an empty con-
stituent in the syntax, in this case, a verb phrase. How-
ever, unlike gapping, VP-ellipsis also results in an inde-
pendently anaphoric form in the semantics.6 Figure 4
shows the representations for the clause Hillary did (the
anaphoric expression is indicated by P).

Given the representation in Figure 1 as the source,
the semantics for the missing VP may be recovered in
&apos;This claim is supported by well-established facts sug-
gesting that gapping does not pattern with standard forms
of anaphora. For instance, unlike VP-ellipsis and overt pro-
nouns, gapping cannot be cataphoric, and can only obtain
its antecedent from the immediately preceding clause.
6Unlike gapping, VP-ellipsis patterns with other types of
anaphora, for instance it can be cataphoric and can locate
antecedents from clauses other than the most immediate
one.

one of two ways. The syntactic VP could be copied
down with its corresponding semantics, from which the
semantics for the complete sentence can be derived. In
this case, the anaphoric expression is constrained to
have the same semantics as the copied constituent. Al-
ternatively, the anaphoric expression could be resolved
purely semantically, resulting in the discharge of the
anaphoric assumption P. The higher-order unification
method developed by Dalrymple et al. (1991) could be
used for this purpose; in this case the sentence-level
semantics is recovered without copying any syntactic
representations.
Event referential forms such as do it, do that, and do
so constitute full verb phrases in the syntax. It has been
often noted (Halliday and Hasan, 1976, inter alia) that
it is the main verb do that is operative in these forms
of anaphora, in contrast to the auxiliary do operative
in VP-ellipsis.&apos; It is the pronoun in event referential
forms that is anaphoric; the fact that the pronouns refer
to events results from the type constraints imposed by
the main verb do. Therefore, such forms are anaphoric
in the semantics, but do not leave behind an empty
constituent in the syntax.
To summarize this section, we have characterized the
forms being addressed according to two features, a sum-
mary of which appears in Table 1. Whereas anaphoric

forms in the semantics for these forms are indepen-
dently resolved, empty syntactic constituents in and of
themselves are not anaphoric, and thus may only be
restored when some independently-motivated process
necessitates it. In the section that follows we outline
two types of discourse inference, one of which requires
such copying of empty constituents.

scribe two types of inference used to enforce the con-
straints that are imposed by coherence relations. In
each case, arguments to coherence relations take the
form of semantic representations retrieved by way of

ations performed on these representations are dictated
by the nature of the constraints imposed. The two types
of inference are distinguished by the level in the syntax
from which these arguments are retrieved .8

Common Topic Inference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994956631578947">
Understanding segments of utterances standing in a
Common Topic relation requires the determination
of points of commonality (parallelism) and departure
(contrast) between sets of corresponding entities and
properties within the utterances. This process is reliant
on performing comparison and generalization opera-
tions on the corresponding representations (Scha and
Polanyi, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Priist, 1992; Asher, 1993).
Table 2 sketches definitions for some Common Topic
relations, some taken from and others adapted from
Hobbs (1990). In each case, the hearer is to understand
the relation by inferring po(ai , a„) from sentence So
and inferring pi(bi , bn) from sentence Si under the
listed constraints.9 In order to meet these constraints,
the identification of po and pi may require arbitrary lev-
els of generalization from the relations explicitly stated
in the utterances.
Examples of these relations are given in sentences

to pattern well with those employing our Common Topic

istic that Common Topic relations share is that they
require the identification of parallel entities (i.e., the ai

constraints. We posit that the syntactic representation
is used both to guide the identification of parallel ele-

Understanding utterances standing in a Coherent Sit-

quires that a path of inference be established between

any constraints on parallelism between sub-sentential

Beyond what is asserted by the two clauses individually,
understanding each of these sentences requires the pre-
supposition that being a politician implies being dishon-
est. Inferring this is only reliant on the sentential-level
semantics for the clauses as a whole; there are no p, ai,
or bi to be independently identified. The same is true
for what Hume called Contiguity relations (perhaps in-
cluding Hobbs&apos; Occasion and Figure-ground relations);
for the purpose of this paper we will consider these as
weaker cases of Cause or Effect.
To reiterate the crucial observation, Common Topic
inference utilizes the syntactic structure in identify-
ing the semantics for the sub-sentential constituents to
serve as arguments to the coherence constraints. In
contrast, Coherent Situation inference utilizes only the
sentential-level semantic forms as is required for ab-
ducing a coherent situation. The question then arises
as to what happens when constituents in the syntax
for an utterance are empty. Given that the discourse
inference mechanisms retrieve semantic forms through
nodes in the syntax, this syntax will have to be recov-
ered when a node being accessed is missing. Therefore,
we posit that missing constituents are recovered as a
by-product of Common Topic inference, to allow the
parallel properties and entities serving as arguments to
the coherence relation to be accessed from within the re-
constructed structure. On the other hand, such copying
is not triggered in Coherent Situation inference, since
the arguments are retrieved only from the top-level sen-
tence node, which is always present. In the next section,
we show how this difference accounts for the data given
in Section 2.

In previous sections, we have classified several ellip-
tical and event referential forms as to whether they
leave behind an empty constituent in the syntax and
whether they are anaphoric in the semantics. Empty
constituents in the syntax are not in themselves refer-
ential, but are recovered during Common Topic infer-

ence. Anaphoric expressions in the semantics are inde-
pendently referential and are resolved through purely
semantic means regardless of the type of discourse in-
ference. In this section we show how the phenomena
presented in Section 2 follow from these properties.

This fact is predicted by our account in the following
way. In the case of Common Topic constructions, the
missing sentence in the target will be copied from the
source, the sentential semantics may be derived, and the
arguments to the coherence relations can be identified
and reasoning carried out, predicting felicity. In the
case of Coherent Situation relations, no such recovery
of the syntax takes place. Since a gapped clause in and
of itself has no sentence-level semantics, the gapping
fails to be felicitous in these cases.
This account also explains similar differences in fe-
licity for other coordinating conjunctions as discussed
in Kehler (1994), as well as why gapping is infelicitous
in constructions with subordinating conjunctions indi-
cating Coherent Situation relations, as exemplified in
(16).

The stripping construction is similar to gapping ex-
cept that there is only one bare constituent in the tar-
get (also generally receiving contrastive accent); unlike
VP-ellipsis there is no stranded auxiliary. We therefore
might predict that stripping is also acceptable in Com-
mon Topic constructions but not in Coherent Situation
constructions, which appears to be the case:12

In summary, gapping and related constructions are
infelicitous in those cases where Coherent Situation in-
ference is employed, as there is no mechanism for re-
covering the sentential semantics of the elided clause.
12Stripping is also possible in comparative deletion con-
structions. A comprehensive analysis of stripping, pseudo-
gapping, and VP-ellipsis in such cases requires an articula-
tion of a syntax and semantics for these constructions, which
will be carried out in future work.

These facts are also predicted by our account. In the
case of Common Topic constructions, a suitable syn-
tactic antecedent must be reconstructed at the site of
the empty VP node, with the result that the anaphoric
expression takes on its accompanying semantics. There-
fore, VP-ellipsis is predicted to require a suitable syn-
tactic antecedent in these scenarios. In Coherent Sit-
uation constructions, the empty VP node is not re-
constructed. In these cases the anaphoric expression
is resolved on purely semantic grounds; therefore VP-
ellipsis is only constrained to having a suitable semantic
antecedent.
The analysis accounts for the range of data given in
Kehler (1993b), although one point of departure exists
between that account and the current one with respect
to clauses conjoined with but. In the previous account
these cases are all classified as non-parallel, resulting in
the prediction that they only require semantic source
representations. In our analysis, we expect cases of pure
contrast to pattern with the parallel class since these are
Common Topic constructions; this is opposed to the vi-
olated expectation use of but which indicates a Coherent
Situation relation. The current account makes the cor-
rect predictions; examples (20) and (21), where but has
the contrast meaning, appear to be markedly less ac-
ceptable than examples (22) and (23), where but has
the violated expectation meaning:I3

To summarize thus far, the data presented in the ear-
lier account as well as examples that conflict with that
analysis are all predicted by the account given here.
As a final note, we consider the interaction between
VP-ellipsis and gapping. The following pair of examples
are adapted from those of Sag (1976, pg. 291):

Sag defines an alphabetic variance condition that cor-
rectly predicts that sentence (25) is infelicitous, but in-
correctly predicts that sentence (24) is also. Sag then
suggests a weakening of his condition, with the result
that both of the above examples are incorrectly pre-
dicted to be acceptable; he doesn&apos;t consider a solution
predicting the judgements as stated.
The felicity of sentence (24) and the infelicity of sen-
tence (25) are exactly what our account predicts. In
example (25), the third clause is in a Common Topic
relationship with the second (as well as the first) and
therefore requires that the VP be reconstructed at the
target site. However, the VP is not in a suitable form,
as the object has been abstracted out of it (yielding
a trace assumption). Therefore, the subsequent VP-
ellipsis fails to be felicitous. In contrast, the conjunc-
tion although used before the third clause in example
(24) indicates a Coherent Situation relation. Therefore,
the VP in the third clause need not be reconstructed,
and the subsequent semantically-based resolution of the
anaphoric form succeeds. Thus, the apparent paradox
between examples (24) and (25) is just what we would
expect.

Recall that Sag and Hankamer (1984) note that whereas
elliptical sentences such as (26a) are unacceptable due
to a voice mismatch, similar examples with event ref-

by sentence (26b):14

As stated earlier, forms such as do it are anaphoric, but
leave no empty constituents in the syntax. Therefore,
it follows under the present account that such reference
is successful without regard to the type of discourse

The literature on ellipsis and event reference is volumi-
nous, and so we will not attempt a comprehensive com-
parison here. Instead, we briefly compare the current
work to three previous studies that explicitly tie ellipsis

resolution to an account of discourse structure and co-
herence, namely our previous account (Kehler, 1993b)
and the accounts of Priist (1992) and Asher (1993).
In Kehler (1993b), we presented an analysis of VP-
ellipsis that distinguished between two types of rela-
tionship between clauses, parallel and non-parallel. An
architecture was presented whereby utterances were
parsed into propositional representations which were
subsequently integrated into a discourse model. It was
posited that VP-ellipsis could access either proposi-
tional or discourse model representations: in the case of
parallel constructions, the source resided in the propo-
sitional representation; in the case of non-parallel con-
structions, the source had been integrated into the dis-
course model. In Kehler (1994), we showed how this
architecture also accounted for the facts that Levin and
Prince noted about gapping.
The current work improves upon that analysis in sev-
eral respects. First, it no longer needs to be posited
that syntactic representations disappear when inte-
grated into the discourse mode1;15 instead, syntactic
and semantic representations co-exist. Second, various
issues with regard to the interpretation of propositional
representations are now rendered moot. Third, there is
no longer a dichotomy with respect to the level of repre-
sentation from which VP-ellipsis locates and copies an-
tecedents. Instead, two distinct factors have been sepa-
rated out: the resolution of missing constituents under
Common Topic inference is purely syntactic whereas
the resolution of anaphoric expressions in all cases is
purely semantic; the apparent dichotomy in VP-ellipsis
data arises out of the interaction between these different
phenomena. Finally, the current approach more read-
ily scales up to more complex cases. For instance, it
was not clear in the previous account how non-parallel
constructions embedded within parallel constructions
would be handled, as in sentences (27a-b):
Clinton was introduced by John because Mary
had refused to, and Gore was too. [ introduced
by John because Mary had refused to]
# Clinton was introduced by John because
Mary had refused to, and Fred did too. [ in-
troduced Clinton because Mary had refused
to]
The current approach accounts for these cases.
The works of Priist (1992) and Asher (1993) pro-
vide analyses of VP-ellipsis 16 in the context of an
account of discourse structure and coherence. With
&apos;This claim could be dispensed with in the treatment
of VP-ellipsis, perhaps at the cost of some degree of the-
oretical inelegance. However, this aspect was crucial for
handling the gapping data, since the infelicity of gapping in
non-parallel constructions hinged on there no longer being
a propositional representation available as a source.

Priist utilizing a mixed representation (called syntac-
tic/semantic structures) and Asher utilizing Discourse
Representation Theory constructs, each defines mecha-
nisms for determining relations such as parallelism and
contrast, and gives constraints on resolving VP-ellipsis
and related forms within their more general frame-
works. However, each essentially follows Sag in requir-
ing that elided VP representations be alphabetic vari-
ants of their referents. This constraint rules out cases
where VP-ellipsis obtains syntactically mismatched an-
tecedents, such as example (19) and other non-parallel
cases given in Kehler (1993b). It also appears that nei-
ther approach can account for the infelicity of mixed
gapping/VP-ellipsis cases such as sentence (25).

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967">
In this paper, we have categorized several forms of el-
lipsis and event reference according to two features: (1)
whether the form leaves behind an empty constituent
in the syntax, and (2) whether the form is anaphoric
in the semantics. We have also described two forms of
discourse inference, namely Common Topic inference
and Coherent Situation inference. The interaction be-
tween the two features and the two types of discourse
inference predicts facts concerning gapping, VP-ellipsis,
event reference, and interclausal coherence for which it
is otherwise difficult to account. In future work we will
address other forms of ellipsis and event reference, as
well as integrate a previous account of strict and sloppy
ambiguity into this framework (Kehler, 1993a).

In this section we review the relevant facts for two such forms of ellipsis, namely gapping and VP-ellipsis, and also compare these with facts concerning non-elliptical event reference.

The distribution of VP-ellipsis has also been shown to be sensitive to the coherence relationship extant between the source and target clauses, but in a different respect. In a previous paper (Kehler, 1993b), five contexts for VP-ellipsis were examined to determine whether the representations retrieved are syntactic or semantic in nature. Evidence was given that VP-ellipsis copies syntactic representations in what was termed parallel constructions (predicting the unacceptability of the voice mismatch in example (6) and nominalized source in example (8)), but copies semantic representations in non-parallel constructions (predicting the acceptability of the voice mismatch in example (7) and the nominalized source in example (9)):2 (6) # The decision was reversed by the FBI, and the ICC did too.

Since a gapped clause in and of itself has no sentence-level semantics, the gapping fails to be felicitous in these cases.

In subsequent sections, we show how the distinct mechanisms for recovering these types of missing information interact with two types of discourse inference to predict the phenomena noted in the previous section. We illustrate the relevant syntactic and semantic properties of these forms using the version of Categorial Semantics described in Pereira (1990). In the Montagovian tradition, semantic representations are compositionally generated in correspondence with the constituent modification relationships manifest in the syntax; predicates are curried. Traces are associated with assumptions which are subsequently discharged by a suitable construction.

The two types of inference are distinguished by the level in the syntax from which these arguments are retrieved .8 Common Topic Inference Understanding segments of utterances standing in a Common Topic relation requires the determination of points of commonality (parallelism) and departure (contrast) between sets of corresponding entities and properties within the utterances. This process is reliant on performing comparison and generalization operations on the corresponding representations (Scha and Polanyi, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Priist, 1992; Asher, 1993). Table 2 sketches definitions for some Common Topic relations, some taken from and others adapted from Hobbs (1990). In each case, the hearer is to understand the relation by inferring po(ai , a„) from sentence So and inferring pi(bi , bn) from sentence Si under the listed constraints.9 In order to meet these constraints, the identification of po and pi may require arbitrary levels of generalization from the relations explicitly stated in the utterances.

In 2These examples have been taken or adapted from Kehler (1993b). The phrases shown in brackets indicate the elided material under the intended interpretation. fact, it appears that gapping is felicitous in those constructions where VP-ellipsis requires a syntactic antecedent, whereas gapping is infelicitous in cases where VP-ellipsis requires only a suitable semantic antecedent. Past approaches to VP-ellipsis that operate within a single module of language processing fail to make the distinctions necessary to account for these differences. Sag and Hankamer (1984) note that while elliptical sentences such as (6) are unacceptable because of a voice mismatch, similar examples with non-elided event referential forms such as do it are much more acceptable: (10) The decision was reversed by the FBI, and the ICC did it too. [ reverse the decision] An adequate theory of ellipsis and event reference must account for this distinction. In sum, the felicity of both gapping and VP-ellipsis appears to be dependent on the type of coherence relation extant between the source and target clauses. Pronominal event reference, on the other hand, appears not to display thi</context>

However, the VP is not in a suitable form, as the object has been abstracted out of it (yielding a trace assumption). Therefore, the subsequent VPellipsis fails to be felicitous. In contrast, the conjunction although used before the third clause in example (24) indicates a Coherent Situation relation. Therefore, the VP in the third clause need not be reconstructed, and the subsequent semantically-based resolution of the anaphoric form succeeds. Thus, the apparent paradox between examples (24) and (25) is just what we would expect. Event Reference Recall that Sag and Hankamer (1984) note that whereas elliptical sentences such as (26a) are unacceptable due to a voice mismatch, similar examples with event referential forms are much more acceptable as exemplified by sentence (26b):14 (26) a. # The decision was reversed by the FBI, and the ICC did too.

Therefore, it follows under the present account that such reference is successful without regard to the type of disc</context>

In the Montagovian tradition, semantic representations are compositionally generated in correspondence with the constituent modification relationships manifest in the syntax; predicates are curried. Traces are associated with assumptions which are subsequently discharged by a suitable construction. Figure 1 shows the representations for the sentence Bill became upset; this will serve as the initial source clause representation for the examples that follow.3 For our analysis of gapping, we follow Sag (1976) in hypothesizing that a post-surface-structure level of syntactic representation is used as the basis for interpretation. In source clauses of gapping constructions, constituents in the source that are parallel to the overt constituents in the target are abstracted out of the clause representation.4 For simplicity, we will assume that &apos;We will ignore the tense of the predicates for ease of exposition. 4It has been noted that in gapping constructions, contrastive accent is generally placed on parallel elements in (3) 51 S: become(upset&apos;XBill&apos;) NP: Bill&apos; VP: become&apos;(upset&apos;) VN Bill: Bill&apos; V: be</context>

Target clauses in gapping constructions are therefore represented with the overt constituents fronted out of an elided sentence node; for instance the representation of the target clause in example (1) is shown in Figure 3 both the target and the source clauses, and that abstracting these elements results in an &amp;quot;open proposition&amp;quot; that both clauses share (Sag, 1976; Prince, 1986; Steedman, 1990). This proposition needs to be presupposed (or accommodated) for the gapping to be felicitous, for instance, it would be infelicitous to open a conversation with sentence such as (1), whereas it is perfectly felicitous in response to the question How did the Clintons react?. Gapping resolution can be characterized as the restoration of this open proposition in the gapped clause. (the empty node is indicated by 43). The empty conS: NP: Hillary&apos; s.

[ introduce Clinton] (23) This letter deserves a response, but before you do, [ respond ] To summarize thus far, the data presented in the earlier account as well as examples that conflict with that analysis are all predicted by the account given here. As a final note, we consider the interaction between VP-ellipsis and gapping. The following pair of examples are adapted from those of Sag (1976, pg. 291): &amp;quot;These examples have been adapted from several in Kehler (1993b). 55 (24) John supports Clinton, and Mary (h Bush, although she doesn&apos;t know why she does.

Sag defines an alphabetic variance condition that correctly predicts that sentence (25) is infelicitous, but incorrectly predicts that sentence (24) is also. Sag then suggests a weakening of his condition, with the result that both of the above examples are incorrectly predicted to be acceptable; he doesn&apos;t consider a solution predicting the judgements as stated. </context>

The two types of inference are distinguished by the level in the syntax from which these arguments are retrieved .8 Common Topic Inference Understanding segments of utterances standing in a Common Topic relation requires the determination of points of commonality (parallelism) and departure (contrast) between sets of corresponding entities and properties within the utterances. This process is reliant on performing comparison and generalization operations on the corresponding representations (Scha and Polanyi, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Priist, 1992; Asher, 1993). Table 2 sketches definitions for some Common Topic relations, some taken from and others adapted from Hobbs (1990). In each case, the hearer is to understand the relation by inferring po(ai , a„) from sentence So and inferring pi(bi , bn) from sentence Si under the listed constraints.9 In order to meet these constraints, the identification of po and pi may require arbitrary levels of generalization from the relations explicitly stated in the utterances. Examples of these relations are given in sentences (13a-d). (13) a. John organized rallies for Clin</context>
