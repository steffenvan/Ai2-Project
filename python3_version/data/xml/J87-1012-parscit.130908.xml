More common usage of these symbols is in line with
H&amp;T, not Linggard: if you pronounced bet with the
sound most people transcribe with /e/, it would sound
like bait. This table is also incomplete, in that several
phonetic symbols used elsewhere in the book — such as
/o/ and /e/ further down on the same page — are not
defined. A table showing common variations in usage of
symbols for sounds, as in Ladefoged (1975: 64), would
have been a great help for the beginner.
On page 24, describing lip position and nasality, he
writes &amp;quot;Fortunately, these two variables do not seem to
be used as continuous variables to any great extent.&amp;quot;
True but misleading. The same thing could be said about
every other nonprosodic linguistic variable!
On page 25, he writes &amp;quot;[In English] the /w/ consists
of a rapid transition from a /u/ position to a /a/ posi-
tion.&amp;quot; Not exactly true. The /w/ consists of a rapid
transition from a position slightly more extreme than /u/
to whatever vowel follows.
On page 25, he writes &amp;quot;But in some languages and
dialects whispered or unvoiced versions of /w/, /j/, /r/,
and /1/ are valid articulatory gestures in their own right.&amp;quot;
True but misleading. Almost any voiced sound can be
found as a regular unvoiced variant in some language,
even vowels (cf. Japanese, Shoshone (Ruhlen 1976:
267)), and in English these sounds are regularly devoiced
when following an unvoiced stop in the same syllable.
On page 26: &amp;quot;The anomalous position of /h/ as a
fricative now becomes clear, since it is obvious that it is
impossible for it to have a voiced equivalent.&amp;quot; In fact,
/h/ is often phonetically voiced.
On page 28: &amp;quot;Pitch is the fundamental frequency of
vibration of the vocal cords.&amp;quot; This is not correct; pitch is
a perception typically corresponding to fundamental
frequency, but which may be influenced by other vari-
ables, such as loudness.
There is something wrong with the spectrogram on
page 33: at the location labeled /r/, the third formant
actually rises a little instead of falling, as it must if an /r/
is to be heard.
On page 37 he says: &amp;quot;For all stops the place of closure
is mainly characterised by the formant transitions into
and out of the stop.&amp;quot; This is a controversial position and
should be labeled as such. Some researchers think that
the noise at the instant of release is more important.
On page 15 he writes: &amp;quot;In general terms, two of these
[formants] are required to specify vowel quality, a third is
required to establish speaker identity, and the
fourth/fifth may be added to give natural voice quality.&amp;quot;
But on page 33: &amp;quot;For a given speaker three formants are
usually enough to characterise the vowel.&amp;quot; This is
confused and confusing. What&apos;s probably true is that
two formants are required for normal vowels, three for
vowels colored with /r/, as in hurt, and no one knows
how many are required for speaker identity and natural
voice quality.
If this review has seemed to concentrate too much on
phonetics, it&apos;s because that&apos;s where the problems lie.
In summary, this book gets a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; in prehistory,
&amp;quot;A&amp;quot; in history, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; in phonetics, and &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; in engineer-
ing. If you want to set up shop in computational phonet-
ics, get this one plus a good book on phonetics, and start
collecting papers from the journals.

To anyone working in artificial intelligence, this book
provides a comprehensive introduction to knowledge
representation (KR). By presenting original source papers
that have served to define the problems of KR, the book
provides a unique overview of the field. The overall
organization of the collection of papers includes
discussion of what constitutes a knowledge represen-
tation language; it presents problems introduced because
of the demand for automatic inferencing to provide
implicit information; and it addresses the issues of what
constitutes an adequate domain knowledge for a specific
application.
The book also includes an extensive partially anno-
tated bibliography of many related works that could not
be included in the volume. These annotations include
pointers to each mentioned article&apos;s applicability to KR in
general, in networks, in frames, regarding logic formal-
isms, whether they are procedural or production system
approaches, or whether they are specific to domain
knowledge representation.
The book has provided an excellent resource for my
Introduction to Natural Language Processing class. It
makes available many of the relevant papers that are crit-
ical to the current focus of research regarding meaning:
What is it? How to represent it? What are the constraints
introduced because of KR assumptions and their role
during implementation, and the general concerns of what
should be included in an implementation. Complementa-
ry as well as opposing viewpoints are found in close
proximity. Even the role of logic in KR, along with the

Seuren&apos;s book can be useful and interesting for two
different kinds of readers: firstly, for those specialists
who are interested simply in problems suggested by the
title itself, and secondly, for students and other people
who are novices in the field of theoretical linguistics and
want to reach its central points going a very difficult but
also very fascinating way. This second &amp;quot;usefulness&amp;quot;
seems to be not so obvious as the first one; probably it
has not even been intended by the author. However, we
should start this review by emphasizing and lauding this
feature of the book in question.
Pieter Seuren does not try to build his theory without
having laid the foundations of it. He places his ideas in a
long tradition of linguistic thought and proposes his
answers to some essential questions relating to language
and linguistics. He considers the main goal of the study
of language to be &amp;quot;an insight into the cognitive machin-
ery which enables humans to use it the way they do&amp;quot; and
describes and criticizes the current situation in the theory
of meaning and grammar with its principal fault being the
insufficiency of linguistic facts to support abstract, formal
systems. Seuren resumes the ancient controversy
between the anomalists and the analogists and places his
book in the former tradition.
These, and many other basic theoretical statements
make this book partially open but not easy! for non-spe-
cialists who wish to familiarize themselves with some
topics of modern linguistic thought.
However, the main purpose of this book is to repre-
sent Seuren&apos;s ideas concerning semantics, especially
describing the meaning of sentences from the point of
view of their role in a discourse. Seuren is of the opinion
that the meaning of a sentence cannot be described in
isolation. The central notion of the book is thus
&amp;quot;discourse domain&amp;quot;, which is defined as a finite number
of distinct addresses, superaddresses, and instructions.
An address is a store to which every new asserted
sentence in the discourse contributes new information
about the individual referred to by the discourse. A
superaddress differs from the address in that it refers not
to individuals but to sets of individuals.
In Seuren&apos;s estimation, the meaning of a sentence
consists in &amp;quot;the systematic modification, or increment,
which it brings about whenever it is added to an appro-
priate given discourse domain&amp;quot;.
These basic definitions are contained in the first chap-
ter which is entitled &amp;quot;Discourse and interpretation&amp;quot;.
They are implemented in other parts of the book, espe-
cially in chapters 4 and 5.
In chapter 2, &amp;quot;Grammar and lexicon&amp;quot;, Seuren arraigns
the idea of surface semantics and represents his version
of traditional SA-semantics, which is based on the
assumption that surface structures are not directly inter-
pretable and, therefore, a separate level of semantic anal-
ysis is needed.
Chapter 3, &amp;quot;The logic and semantics of
presupposition&amp;quot;, gives us, among other things, the idea of
presuppositional three-valued logic which is also devel-
oped in the appendix by A. Weijters.
The book in question contains many fragments which
are really exciting. It gives a large and original picture of
one of the most important topics in modern linguistics.

The two books under review here have much in commow
not only do they both deal with the question of compre-
hension of narratives in general, but they also share the
view that this can be achieved via understanding of the
goals of the participants involved. This coincidence
perhaps stems from the shared background of the two
authors, namely the Yale-based work of Schank, Abel-
son, and others, to which both authors make reference, in
some instances extensively. In case this revelation should
lead some readers to prejudge the works immediately, it
must be said that the Schankian influence is less evident
in Wilensky&apos;s book than in Dyer&apos;s.
