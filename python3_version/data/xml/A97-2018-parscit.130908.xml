1 Multilingual NameTagTm
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998766875">
SRA&apos;s Multilingual NameTag is name tagging-
software that can handle multiple languages, includ-
ing English, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese and Thai.
It finds and disambiguates in texts the names of peo-
ple, organizations, and places, as well as time and
numeric expressions with very high accuracy. The
design of the system makes possible the dynamic
recognition of names: NameTag does not rely on
long lists of known names. Instead, NameTag makes
use of a flexible pattern specification language to
identify novel names that have not been encountered
previously. This makes maintenance and porting to
new domains very easy. In addition, NameTag can
recognize and link variants of names in the same
document automatically. For instance, it can link
&amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;International Business Machines&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;President Clinton&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Bill Clinton.&amp;quot;
NameTag incorporates a language-independent
C++ pattern-matching engine along with the
language-specific lexical, pattern, and other re-
sources necessary for each language. The Japanese,
Chinese, and Thai versions integrate word seg-
menters to deal with the challenges of these lan-
guages.
NameTag is an extremely fast and robust system
that can be easily integrated with other applications
through its API. For example, it can be integrated
with an information retrieval system to improve re-
trieval accuracy and with a machine translation sys-
tem to prevent name translation mistakes. Versions
are available for UNIX and Windows 95 and NT
platforms.

<bodyText confidence="0.9984696">
The Multilingual Internet Surveillance System uses
SRA&apos;s NameTag, the powerful SQL capability of an
RDBMS, and a Java-enhanced Web-based GUI to
provide an intelligent surveillance capability. The
special features include:

• Built-in Java-based Web crawler: By using

<bodyText confidence="0.6901745">
this built-in Web crawler, the user can choose
key WWW sites for surveillance. It automat-
ically retrieves Web documents for intelligent
indexing. The crawler has a built-in scheduler
and make uses of multiple threads for the quick-
est possible acquisition of documents.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999637">
• Concept-based intelligent indexing by
NameTag: SRA&apos;s NameTag indexes retrieved
Web documents and extracts the most impor-
tant information, i.e. the proper names. In ad-
dition, NameTag can be customized to identify
collections of other domain specific terms which
are of interest to a particular Internet surveil-
lance system (e.g., financial, legal, medical or
military terms).

active monitoring and alert capabili-
ties: Using a variety of data mining techniques,
the system can monitor daily activities on the
Internet (what&apos;s new and hot today?) and alert
the user to unusual activity as it is happening.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.894364315789474">
• Powerful SQL queries through an easy-to-
use Web-based GUI: Once alerts go off, the
user can perform more in-depth analysis by re-
trieving relevant information through the user-
friendly GUI. Powerful SQL capability along
with concept-based indexing ensures high pre-
cision and time saving.
• Automated hyperlinking for intelligent
browsing: Another way to analyze the infor-
mation effectively is to browse texts by following
hyperlinks automatically created by the system.
Hyperlinks are added for each proper name and
custom term found by NameTag.
• Multilingual capability for monolingual
speakers: By incorporating multilingual ver-
sions of NameTag and machine translation
modules, monolingual speakers can also re-
trieve, browse, and analyze the content of for-
eign language documents.

<bodyText confidence="0.9996935">
The multilingual capability allows the user to

guages without further effort. For example, by sim-
ply clicking on one of the hyperlinks, the user can
view a list of other articles in any language that con-
tain the same term (either original and translated).
By entering queries in English, the user can obtain
all documents in any language that contain the En-
glish terms or their translations.
The Multilingual Internet Surveillance System
provides a truly unique way to analyze and discover
necessary information effectively and efficiently from
a vast information repositories on the Internet. For
example, it can answer types of questions which can-
not be asked of traditional search engines, such as
&amp;quot;Which companies are mentioned along with Inter-
net and Netscape?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Which people are related to
the Shinshintou Party?&amp;quot;
In addition, the concept-based indexing allows
high-precision search; the user can ask for docu-
ments that contain &amp;quot;Dole,&amp;quot; the former senator, in-
stead of &amp;quot;Dole,&amp;quot; the pineapple company. In short,
the system can eliminate most of the noise associated
with traditional search engines and focus attention
on precisely the information of interest.
The Web-based client runs on multiple platforms.
The server currently runs on a SUN Solaris platform
(other server ports are underway).

3 Multimedia Fusion System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999375138888889">
The Multimedia Fusion System (MMF) combines an
automated clustering algorithm with a summariza-
tion module to automatically group multimedia in-
formation by content and simultaneously determine
concise keyword summaries of each cluster. MMF
assists the user who must assimilate a vast amount
of information from different sources quickly and ef-
fectively. As MMF generates clusters in an unsuper-
vised fashion, i.e., no pre-defined user profile need
be used, the system can adapt to new and changing
world events with no extra effort.
Specifically, the system takes newspaper articles
and CNN Headline News, and creates a hierarchi-
cal cluster tree in which related stories are clustered
together at tree nodes regardless of their sources.
MMF consists of four main components: keyword
selection, document clustering, cluster summariza-
tion, and cluster display. The resulting cluster tree
is visualized in a Java-based interactive GUI. The
user can follow a cluster tree hierarchy and expand
clusters all the way down to individual documents.
For newspaper articles, the text is shown while for
CNN Headline News, both the closed-captioned text
and the captured video are displayed in-line with a
browser plug-in. Each displayed cluster also has its
concise keyword summary next to the corresponding
tree node.
In addition to its clustering capabilities, the MMF
server is also responsible for capturing video, audio,
and closed-captions from a live satellite feed in real
time. The data is segmented as it is received and can
be simultaneously stored and forwarded to viewers
on the network. The server also handles data input
through textual newswire feeds.
The Web-based client runs on multiple platforms.
The server currently runs on a SUN Solaris platform.
