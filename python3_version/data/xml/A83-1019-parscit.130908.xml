In an age of increased attention to the

economic problems of many potential databases
remains the entry of the original information into
the database. Specialized information extraction

available in certain restricted types of natural

of the problems of engineering such systems and a

A. Overview of the Paper
In an age of increased attention to the
problems of database organization retrieval
problems and query languages, one of the major
economic problems of many potential databases
remains the entry of the original information into
the database. A large amount of such information
is currently available in natural Language text,
and some of that text is of a highly stylized
nature, with a restricted semantic domain. It is
the task of specialized information extraction
(SU) systems to obtain information automatically
from such texts and place it in the database. As
with any system, it is desirable to minimize
errors and human intervention, but a total absence
of either is not necessary for the system to be
economically viable.

In this paper, we will first discuss some
general characteristics of SIE systems, then
describe the development of an experimental system
to assist in the construction of a database of
chemical reaction information. Many journals,
such as the Journal of Organic Chemistry, have
separate experimental sections, in which the
procedures for preparing chemical compounds are
described. It is desired to extract certain
information about these reactions and place it in
the database. A reaction information form (RIF)
was developed in another project to contain the
desired information. The purpose of the system is
to eliminate the necessity in a majority of
cases, for a trained reader to read the text and
enter the R/F information into the machine.

B. Some Terminology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921484848485">
In the discussion below, we shall use the
term grammar to mean a system consisting of a
lexicon, a syntax, a meaning representation lan-
guage, and a semantic mappina. The lexicon
consists of the list of words in the language and
one or more grammatical categories for each word.
The syntax specifies the structure of sentences in
the language in terms of the grammatical
categories. Morphological procedures may specify
a &amp;quot;syntax&amp;quot; within classes of words and ther,by
reduce the size of the lexicon. A discourse
structure, or extrasentential syntax, may also be
included.
The semantic mapping provides for each
syntactically correct sentence a meaning repre-
sentation in the meaning representation language,
and it is the crux of the whole system. If the
semantic mapping is fundamentally straightforward,
then the syntactic processing can often he
reduced, as well. This is one of the virtues of
SIE systems: Because of the specialized subject
matter, one can simplify syntactic processing
through the use of ad hoc procedures (either
algorithmic or heuristic). In many cases, the
knowledge that allows this is nonlinguistic
knowledge, which may be encoded in frames.
Although this is not always the sense in which
&amp;quot;frame&amp;quot; is used, this is the sense in which we
shall use the term in our discussion below:
Frames encode nonlinguistic &amp;quot;expectations&amp;quot; brought
to bear on the task. In this light, it is inter-
esting to explore the subject of case-slot iden-
tity, as raised by Charniak (1981). If the slots
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998649">
109
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.978968204081633">
are components of frames, and cases are names for
arguments of a predicate, then the slots in any
practical language understanding system may not
correspond exactly to the cases in a language. In
fact, the predicates may not correspond to the
frames. On the other hand, if the Language is
capable of expressing all of the distinctions that
can be understood in terms of the frames, one
would expect them to grow closer and closer as the
system became less specialized. The decision as
to whether to maintain the distinction between
predicate/case and frame/slot has a &amp;quot;Whorfian&amp;quot;
flavor to it. We have chosen to maintain that
distinction.
Despite the general decision with regards
to predicates and slots, some of the grammatical
categories in our work do not correspond precisely
to conventional grammatical categories, but are
specialized for the reaction information project.
An example is &amp;quot;chemical name&amp;quot;, This illustrates
another reason that SIE systems are more practical
than more general language understanding systems:
One can use certain ad hoc categories based upon
the characteristics of the problem (and of the
underlying meanings represented). This idea was
advocated several years ago by Thompson (1966) and
used in the design of a specialized database query
system (DEACON). Its problem in more general
language processing applications - that the
categories may not extend readily from one domain
to another and may actually complicate the general
grammar - does not cause as much difficulty in the
SIE case. The danger of using ad hoc categories
is. of course, that one can lose extensibility,
and must make careful decisions in advance as to
how specialized the SIE system is going to be.
U. SPECIALIZED INFORMATION EXTRACTION
A. Characteristics of the SIE Task
The term &amp;quot;specialized information extrac-
tion&amp;quot; is necessarily a relative one. Information
extraction can range from the simplest sorts of
tasks like obtaining all names of people men-
tioned in newspaper articles, to a full under-
standing of relatively free text. The simplest of
these require of the program little linguistic or
empirical knowledge, while the most complex
require more knowledge than we know how to :ye.
But when we refer to an SIE task, we will mean one
that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.935789428571429">
(1) Deals with a restricted subject
matter
(2) Requires information that can be
classified under a limited number of
discrete parameters, and
(3) Deals with language of a specialized
type, usually narrative reports.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999482324324324">
SIE programs are more feasible than
automatic translation because the restrictions
lessen the ambiguity problems. This is even true
in comparison to other tasks with a restricted
subject matter, such as natural language computer
programming or database query. Furthermore, these
latter tasks require a very low error rate in
order to be useful, because users will not
tolerate either incorrect results or constant
queries and requests for rewording from the
program, while SIE programs would be successful if
they produced results in, say, 80% of cases and
required that the information extraction be done
by humans in the others. Even small rates of
undetected errors would be tolerable in many
situations, though one would wish to minimize
them
The lessened syntactic variety in SIE
tasks means that the amount of syntactic analysis
needed is lessened, and also the complexity of the
machinery for the semantic mapping. At the same
time, the specialized semantic domain allows the
use of empirical knowledge to increase the
efficiency and effectiveness of analysis proce-
dures (the lessening of ambiguity being only one
aspect of this).
The particular cases of SIR that we have
chosen are highly structured paragraphs, describ-
ing laboratory procedures for synthesizing organic
substances which were taken from the experimental
section of articles in J. Org. Chem. Our feeling
is that the full text of chemical articles is
beyond the state of the SIE art, if one wants to
extract anything more than trivial information;
hut the limited universe of discourse of the
experimental paragraphs renders SIE on them
feasible.

B. The Engineering of SIE Systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923595744681">
Since the days of the early mechanical
translation efforts, the amount of study of
natural language phenomena, both from the point of
view of pure theory and of determining specific
facts about languages, has been substantial.
Similarly, techniques for dealing with Languages
and other sorts of complex information by computer
have been considerably extended and the work has
been facilitated by the provision of higher-level
programming languages and by the availability of
faster machines and increased storage. Never-
theless, the state of scientific knowledge of
language and of processes for utilizing that
knowledge is still such that it is necessary to
take an &amp;quot;engineering approach&amp;quot; to the design of
computational linguistics systems.
In using the term &amp;quot;engineering&amp;quot;, we mean
to indicate that compromises have to be made in
the design of the system between what is theoreti-
cally desirable, and what is feasible at the state
of the art. Failing to have a complete grammar of
the language over which one wishes to have SI!,
one uses heuristics to determine features that one
wants. At the same time, one uses the scientific
knowledge available, insofar as that is feasible.
One builds and tests model or pilot systems to
explore problems and techniques and tries to
extrapolate the experience to production systems,
which themselves are likely r.o have to be
&amp;quot;incrementally developed&amp;quot;.
In any engineering context, evaluation
measures are important. These measures allow one
to set criteria for acceptability of designs which
are likely always to be imperfect, and to compare
alternative systems. The ultimate evaluation
measure on which management decisions rest is
usually cost/benefit ratio. This can be deter-
mined only after examining the human alternatives
and their effectiveness. It is important to be
able to quantify these alternatives, and this is
often not done. For instance, it is common to
assume that an automatic system should not produce
errors, whereas humans always do; so the percent-
age of errors should be determined experimentally
in each case and compared.
For the evaluation of SIE systems, we
would like to propose three measures;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981785">
(1) Robustness - the percentage of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957625">
inputs handled. Most real SIE sys-
tems will reject certain inputs, so
the robustness will be one minus the
percentage rejected.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96834725">
(2) Accuracy - the percentage of
those inputs handled which are cor-
rectly handled.
(3) Error rate - the percentage of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989416540540541">
erroneous entries within incorrectly
an handled input.
Probably the most difficult aspect of SIE
engineering is the provision of a safety factor -
an ability of the system to recognize inputs that
it cannot handle. It is clear that one can create
a system that is robust and acceptably accurate
which has unacceptable error rates for certain
inputs. If the system is to be useful, it must be
possible automatically to determine which docu-
ments contain unacceptable error rates. It does
no good to determine this manually, since that
iould mean essentially redoing all of the infor-
:Ation extraction menually, and the space of
&apos;tiocuments is not sufficiently uniform or con-
tinuous that sampling methods would do any good.
it appears, then, that the only way that one is
going to be able to provide a safety factor is to
have a system that understands enough about the
linguistic and nonlinguistic aspects of the texts
to know when it is not understanding (at least
most of the time). We shall have more to say
about the safety factor when we discuss our system
below.
One suggestion often made for &amp;quot;intel-
ligent&amp;quot; systems is that they be given some
provision for improving their performance by
&amp;quot;learning&amp;quot;. Generally the problem with this
suggestion is that the complexity of the learning
process is greater than that of the original
system, and it is also unclear in many cases what
the machine needs to learn. It nevertheless seems
feasible for SIE systems to learn by interaction
with people who are doing information extraction
tasks. The simplest case of this would be aug-
menting the lexicon, but others should be pos-
sible. The first step in this process would be to
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994868">
111
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.992344380952381">
build in a sufficient safety factor that most
incorrectly handled documents can be explicitly
rejected. The second would be to localize the
factors that caused the rejection sufficiently to
be able to ask for help from the person doing the
manual extraction process. Although we have
considered this aspect of SIE development, we have
not made any attempt to implement it.
A. The Description of Chemical Reactions
A particular task that would appear to be
a candidate for SIE, under the criteria given
above, is the extraction of information on chemi-
cal reactions from experimental sections of chemi-
cal journals. The journal chosen for our
experimental work was the Journal of Organic.
Chemistry. Two examples of reaction descriptions
from this journal are shown in Figure 1. Both of
these examples have a particular type of discourse
structure, which we have called the &amp;quot;simple
model&amp;quot;. The paragraphs in the figure (but not in
the actual texts) are divided into four com-
ponents: a heading, a synthesis, a work-up, and a
characterization. Usually, the heading names the
substance that is produced in the reaction, the
synthesis portion describes the steps followed in
conducting the reaction, the work-up portion
describes the recovery of the substance from the
reaction mixture, and the characterization portion
presents analytical data supporting the structure
assignment. Most of the information that we wish
to obtain is in the synthesis portion, which
describes the chemical reactants, reaction con-
ditions and apparatus.
Figure 2 shows the Reaction Information
Form (RIF) designed to hold the required reaction
information, with information supplied for the two
paragraphs illustrated in Figure 1. One point to
notice is that not every piece of data is con-
tained in ev,.ry reaction description. Thus there
are blanks in both examples, corresponding to
informatisln le-ft unspecified in the corresponding
ciscriptions (those shown in Figure 1).

B. An SIE System for Reaction Information
1. General Organization
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998026388888889">
The chemical reaction SIE is written in
PL/I and runs on a 370/168 under TSO. The testing
of certain of the algorithms and heuristics has
been done using %MOLL, (SPITROL) running under
UNIX on a FDP 11/70. The choice of PL/I on the
370 was dictated by practical considerations
involving the availability of textual material,
the unusual format of that material, and the
availability of existing PL/I routines to deal
with that format.
The programs comprising each stage of the
system are implemented modularly. Thus the lexi-
cal stage involves separate passes for individual
lexical categories. In some cases, these are not
order-independent. In the syntactic phase, the
individual modules are &amp;quot;word experts&amp;quot;, and in the
last (extraction) phase, they are individual
&amp;quot;frames&amp;quot; or components of frames,

2. The Lexical Stage
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98496247368421">
In the lexical stage, both dictionary
lookup and morphological analysis are used to
classify words. Morphological analysis procedures
include suffix normalization, stemming and root
word lookup and analysis of internal punctuation.
Chemical substances may be identified by complex
words and phrases, and are therefore surprisingly
difficult to isolate.
Both lexical and syntactic means are used
to isolate and tag chemical names. In the lexical
stage, identifiable chemical roots, such as &amp;quot;benz&amp;quot;
and terms, such as &amp;quot;iso-&amp;quot; are tagged. In the
syntactic stage, a procedure uses clues such as
parenthetical expressions, internal commas and the
occurrence of juxtaposed chemical roots to iden-
tify chemical names. This is really morphology,
of course. It also uses the overall syntax of the
sentence to check whether a substance name is
expected and to delimit the chemical name.

<bodyText confidence="0.999873916666667">
Chemical substances which comprise the
reactants and the products of a chemical reaction,
as well as the reaction conditions and yield, are

dures to the data structures built during roe
lexical stage.

turned out to resemble a standard procedural
implementation (Winograd, 1971) (based mostly on
particular words or word ,:ategories, however).
Their function is to determine the role of a word
taking lexical and syntactic context into con-
sideration. The word expert approach was ini-
tially chosen because it enables the implemen-
tation of fragments of a grammar and does not
require the development of a comprehensive gram-
mar. Since irrelevant portions can be identified
by reliable heuristics and eliminated, this
attribute is particularly useful in the SIE con-
text. The procedures also allow the incorporation
of heuristics for isolating certain items of
interest.
In this context, it might be maintained
that the interface between the syntax and the
semantic mapping is even less clean than in cer-
tain other systems. This is intentional. Because
of the specialized nature of the process, we have
implemented the &amp;quot;semantic counterpart of syntax&amp;quot;
concept, as advocated by Thompson (1966), where we
judged that it would not impair the generality of
the system within the area of reaction descrip-
tions. We have tried not to make decisions that
would make it difficult to extend the system to
descriptions of reactions that do not obey the
&amp;quot;simple model&amp;quot;. The advantages of this approach
were discused in Section I.
The system pays particular attention to verb
arguments, which are generally marked by
prepositions This &amp;quot;case&amp;quot; type analysis gives
pretty good direct clues to the function of items
within the meaning representation. Sentencu
structure is relatively regular, though extraposed
phrases and a few types of clauses must be dealt
with. Fortunately, the results, in terms Jf
function of chemicals and reaction conditions, Are
the same whether the verb form is in an embedded
clause or the main verb of the sentence. In other
words, we do not have to deal with the nuances
implied by higher predicates, or with implicative
verbs, presuppositions, and the like.

The semantic mapping could be directly to
the components of the reaction . information form,
and that is the approach that was implemented in
the first programs. This gave reasonable results
in some test cases, but appeared to be less exten-
sible to other models of reaction description than
was desirable. A SNOBOL4 version maps the syntax
to a predicate-argument formalism, with a case
frame for each verb designating the possible
irguments for each predicate.

5. The Extraction Stage
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994320975609756">
The meaning representation gives a pretty
clear indication of the function of items withiu
the RIF in the simple model. Since we wadted to
experiment with generality in this system, we
wished to separate general knowledge from linguis-
tic knowledge, and for that reason, the actual
extraction of items is done using the frame tech-
nique (Minsky, 1975; Charniak, 1975).
In the literature, frames and similar
devices vary both in their format and in their
function. In some cases, the .information that
they encode is still linguistic, at least in part.
We are using them in the &amp;quot;nonlinguistic&amp;quot; sense, as
discussed in Section I. In our system, frames
encode the expectations that a trained reader
would bring to the task of extracting information
from synthetic descriptions, involving the usual
structure of these descriptions.
A frame is being developed initially for
the simple model. This frame looks for the syn-
thesis section, discarding work-up and charac-
terization ,.-.:cent for 4hic&amp;quot; is
t, tl ,hn 4.rL.-..tv. IL then focuses on
the synthesis, whe&apos;&apos; subframes correspond to the
particular entries aeeded in the RIF.
As one example, the &amp;quot;time&amp;quot; frame expects
to find a series of reaction step times in the
description. These are already labelled &amp;quot;time&amp;quot;,
and the frame will know that it has to total them,
making approximations of such time expressions as
&amp;quot;overnight&amp;quot; and indicating that the total is then
approximate. Another example is the &amp;quot;temperature&amp;quot;
frame, which expects a series of temperatures, and
must calculate the minimum and maximum, in order
to specify a range. Again, a certain amount of
specialized knowledge, such as the temperature
indicated by an ice water bath&apos;, is necessary.
C. Evaluation of the System
As of the date of this paper, we have only

the reaction coding form. As noted above, this
version does not have the generality that we
desire, but gives a pretty good indication of the
capabilities of the system, as now implemented.
As a test of the system, we ran it on
fifty synthetic paragraphs from the experimental
sections of the Journal of Organic Chemiqu, and
thirty-six were processed satisfactorily. Four
had clear, detectable problems, so the robustness
was 92%, but the accuracy was only 78%, since ten
of the paragraphs did not follow the simple model,
and were nevertheless processed. Since these were
full of errors, we did not cry to compute a figure
for average error rate.
Although the objective of building this
experimental system was only to deal with the
simple model, the exercise has made clear to us
the importance of the safety factor in making a
system such as this useful. We intend to continue
work with the present system only for a few weeks,
meanwhile considering the problems and promises of
extending it.

IV. RELATION TO SOME OTHER SIE SYSTEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999050853658537">
The problem that we have had concerning
the safety factor is one that is likely to be
found in any SIE system, but it is soluble we
feel. Even though we have not completed work on
this experimental system as of the time of writing
this paper (we have found more syntactic and
semantic procedures to be implemented), we already
have ideas as to how to build in a better safety
factor. Generally, these can be characterized as
using some of the information that can be gleaned
by a combination of linguistic and chemical
knowledge which we had ignored as redundant.
While it is redundant in &amp;quot;successful&amp;quot; cases, it
produces conflicts in other cases, indicating that
something is wrong, and that the document should
be processed by hand.
If the safety factor can be improved, siE
systems offer a promising area of application of
computational linguistics techniques. Clearly,
nothing less than computational linguistics tech-
niques show any hope of providing a reasonable
safety factor - or ever adequate robustness and
accuracy.
The promise of the sTE area has been
recognized by other researchers. Systems that
fall within this paradigm include one constructed
by the Operating Systems Division of Logicon
(Silva, Montgomery and Dwiggins, 1979), which aims
to &amp;quot;model the cognitive activities of the human
analyst as he reads and understands message text,
distilling its contents into information items of
interest to him, and building a conceptual model
of the information conveyed by the message,&amp;quot; in
the area of missile and satellite reports and
aircraft activities. Another project, at Rutgers
University, involves the analysis of case descrip-
tions concerning glaucoma patients (Ciesielski,
1979), and the most extensive SIE project, also in
the medical area, is that of the group headed by
Naomi Sager (1981) at New York University, and
described in her book.

Specialized information extraction (SIE) systems are therefore of potential importance in the entry of information that is already available in certain restricted types of natural language text. This paper contains a discussion of the problems of engineering such systems and a description of a particular SIE system, designed to extract information regarding chemical reactions from experimental sections of papers in the chemical literature and to produce a data structure containing the relevant information.</abstract>

In many cases, the knowledge that allows this is nonlinguistic knowledge, which may be encoded in frames. Although this is not always the sense in which &amp;quot;frame&amp;quot; is used, this is the sense in which we shall use the term in our discussion below: Frames encode nonlinguistic &amp;quot;expectations&amp;quot; brought to bear on the task. In this light, it is interesting to explore the subject of case-slot identity, as raised by Charniak (1981). If the slots 109 are components of frames, and cases are names for arguments of a predicate, then the slots in any practical language understanding system may not correspond exactly to the cases in a language. In fact, the predicates may not correspond to the frames. On the other hand, if the Language is capable of expressing all of the distinctions that can be understood in terms of the frames, one would expect them to grow closer and closer as the system became less specialized. The decision as to whether to maintain the distinction between predicate/case and frame/slot has a &amp;quot;Whorfian&amp;quot; fl</context>

Despite the general decision with regards to predicates and slots, some of the grammatical categories in our work do not correspond precisely to conventional grammatical categories, but are specialized for the reaction information project. An example is &amp;quot;chemical name&amp;quot;, This illustrates another reason that SIE systems are more practical than more general language understanding systems: One can use certain ad hoc categories based upon the characteristics of the problem (and of the underlying meanings represented). This idea was advocated several years ago by Thompson (1966) and used in the design of a specialized database query system (DEACON). Its problem in more general language processing applications - that the categories may not extend readily from one domain to another and may actually complicate the general grammar - does not cause as much difficulty in the SIE case. The danger of using ad hoc categories is. of course, that one can lose extensibility, and must make careful decisions in advance as to how specialized the SIE system is going to be. U.

Since irrelevant portions can be identified by reliable heuristics and eliminated, this attribute is particularly useful in the SIE context. The procedures also allow the incorporation of heuristics for isolating certain items of interest. In this context, it might be maintained that the interface between the syntax and the semantic mapping is even less clean than in certain other systems. This is intentional. Because of the specialized nature of the process, we have implemented the &amp;quot;semantic counterpart of syntax&amp;quot; concept, as advocated by Thompson (1966), where we judged that it would not impair the generality of the system within the area of reaction descriptions. We have tried not to make decisions that would make it difficult to extend the system to descriptions of reactions that do not obey the &amp;quot;simple model&amp;quot;. The advantages of this approach were discused in Section I. The system pays particular attention to verb arguments, which are generally marked by prepositions This &amp;quot;case&amp;quot; type analysis gives pretty good direct clues to the function of items within the meaning representation.
