Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861466666667">
This paper deals with the distribution and
reference of the German demonstrative
pronoun der and its case and gender vari-
ants, in comparison with the behaviour of
personal pronouns. After introducing the
relevant facts about both pronoun types,
we develop our Complementarily Hy-
pothesis, which claims that demonstra-
tives differ from personal pronouns
mainly in that they prefer less salient ref-
erents. The hypothesis is tested against a
newspaper corpus and is found to be fun-
damentally correct. The paper concludes
with the discussion of the empirical re-
sults and their effect for future work.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999781">
Unlike English, German has demonstrative pro-
nouns that are inflected for number, gender, and
case and can refer also to persons as well as other
individuals, very much like personal pronouns.
Here are some examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9731985">
(1) Paul wollte mit Peter laufen gehen. Aber
{er/der} war erldltet.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96041330952381">
[Paul wanted to go running with Peter. But
Ihe4DEmoNsTRD had a cold.]
(2) Paul sah eine Frau hereinkommen. {Sie/Die}
trug einen schwarzen Mantel.
[Paul saw a woman enter. She was wearing a
black coat.]
In (1) the demonstrative der can only refer to
Peter, while the personal pronoun er can only
refer to Paul. In (2) both the personal pronoun sie
and the demonstrative die can be used equally
well to refer to the woman.
There is, to the best of our knowledge, no
computational nor any explicit formal linguistic
account of German demonstratives. — One obsta-
cle is that the same forms are also used as defi-
nite articles and relative pronouns, which makes
it hard at times to single out demonstrative uses
automatically. Some part of speech taggers, even
very good ones, sytematically go wrong on de-
monstratives&apos;. A further problem for a systematic
account is that demonstratives, as we already saw
in (2), overlap in their distribution as well as in
their referential options with the personal pro-
nouns and the distinction occasionally looks like
no more than a stylistic one.
The main reason that no computational ac-
count has been attempted, however, is probably
that there seems no urgent need for it: Demon-
strative pronouns of the der paradigm — different
from other German demonstrative pronouns like
dieser, jener, derjenige, derselbe, etc. — are com-
paratively rare. In a large German newspaper
corpus 94.8% of all occurrences of der were
found to be occurrences of the definite article, a
further 4.8% were occurrences of the relative
pronoun, and a mere 0.4% were occurrences of
the demonstrative pronoun2. Because of its clear
deictic potential, similar to English this or that,
one might think that the demonstrative would be
more frequent in spoken language. But an unbi-
ased comparison would require written and spo-
ken corpora of the same discourse type, which

we have not been able to acquire. So we have to
leave this point to speculation3.
So, why would one want a computational
identification of demonstratives, and why would
one want a better understanding of their refer-
ence? On the one hand, there is of course the mo-
tivation from applications, similar as for all other
work on reference resolution: A treatment of
demonstratives is clearly needed, e.g., for ma-
chine translation. Nearly no German demonstra-
tive can be adequately translated into English, or
most other languages, without reference resolu-
tion.
On the other hand, independent of applica-
tions, we believe that an improved understanding
of demonstratives may contribute both to a better
understanding of processes of pronominal refer-
ence and to theoretical accounts of information
structure and the dynamics of discourse.
The interesting point about German demon-
stratives in this connection is that they allow for
a fairly direct comparison of pronominal ana-
phoric and demonstrative reference in a way this
comparison is not possible for other languages.
In English we could look at differences between
it, this, and that. But here the range of potential
referents brings in a number of additional com-
plications (cf. Passonneau 1989, Webber 1991,
Eckert &amp; Strube 2000) that are avoided when we
compare personal and demonstrative pronouns in
German.
This paper takes a few modest steps towards
an account of the distribution and reference of
demonstratives, but what we have to offer is still
work in progress. We have not yet looked at all
forms of the demonstrative. What we have
worked out so far is an hypothesis about the dis-
tinction between different uses of the demonstra-
tive and personal pronouns, and we have put this
hypothesis to the test with a small 350,000 word
corpus of written German.
</bodyText>

3 The Verbmobil corpus of spoken German (http:// verbmo-
bil.dfki.de/) has a ratio of personal pronouns to demonstratives of
1:4, while the Negra corpus of written German yields about 8:1.
However, this comparison remains inconclusive: the Verbmobil
corpus consists of dialogues negotiating the time and place of ap-
pointments, while the Negra corpus is a regular daily newspaper
corpus with obviously vastly different discourse structure.

2 Demonstrative and personal pronouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989664571428571">
At a first glance there is considerable overlap in
the distribution of demonstrative and personal
pronouns. In many contexts, as already in exam-
ple (2), either form seems acceptable and seman-
tic, pragmatic, or even stylistic differences are
hard to pinpoint. This is also true in the follow-
ing cases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995351">

steiner ihren Sondermiill von 9 bis 10 Uhr zu

<bodyText confidence="0.999789384615384">
[At first the rent demands of the investor (38
marks per square meter) were too high. Then
he reduced them to under 30 Marks.]
The impression that there is an area of overlap
where the function of the demonstrative pronoun
is indistinguishable from the anaphoric personal
pronoun and where the two forms could be sub-
stituted for each other without a clear grammati-
cal or semantic difference was confirmed in two
psycholinguistic experiments carried out by our
project group (see Cummins et al. (in prepara-
tion)). Self-paced reading as well as native
speakers&apos; acceptability preferences yielded no
significant difference.
This functional overlap of personal and de-
monstrative pronouns may well be an artefact of
underspecified data though. If, as we shall argue,
the difference between the two types of pronouns
is a matter of information structure, then the dis-
tinction may not show up when not enough in-
formation structure is visible — most clearly
when we consider odd sentences in isolation, but
often also in sentence pairs.
Still, there are occurrences of the two pro-
noun types for which the difference is quite clear
as already in (1), repeated here:
</bodyText>

(1) Paul wollte mit Peter laufen gehen. Aber
{eeder} war erkaltet.
[Paul wanted to go running with Peter. But
fheADEMONSTRD had a cold.]
The er can only be interpreted with reference to
Paul, while der must refer to Peter — a difference
that is hard to emulate in an English translation.
But also a difference in grammaticality can be
found. In (5) only the demonstrative is allowed
while the personal pronoun would be ungram-
matical:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.83663375">
(5) Die Gelder sollen nicht aus dem Etat des

<bodyText confidence="0.973530777777778">
[The money should not come out of the
budget of the Ministry of Environment, but

opment.]
The way that demonstratives differ from personal
pronouns may in some respects be reminiscent of
differences found in English between stressed
and unstressed personal pronouns, as docu-
mented by Akmajian and Jackendoff (1970). Cf.4
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.696895">
(6) When {he/HE} came home, John was tired.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.879775">
where the unstressed anaphoric pronoun clearly
refers to John and the stressed HE cannot be so
interpreted. In addition we have cases like those
brought up by Lakoff (1971):
(7) John called Fred a Republican. Then he in-
SULted him.
(7&apos;) John called Fred a Republican. Then HE in-
sulted HIM.
Also here the referential options of the pronouns
change when the pronouns are accentuated. Ob-
servations like these suggest something like a
complementarity between stressed and un-
stressed personal pronouns in English as was
claimed in Kameyama&apos;s (1999) Complementary
Preference Hypothesis: &amp;quot;A focused pronoun [i.e.
stressed personal pronoun] takes the complemen-

<bodyText confidence="0.999935">
tary preference of the unstressed counterpart.&amp;quot; —
where the referents of both stressed and un-
stressed pronouns come from the current focus of
attention of the discourse, the Forward-looking
Centre of the preceding utterance, in terms of
Centering Theory (Grosz e.a. 1995).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.674826125">
But the distinction between German personal
and demonstrative pronouns is not the same. The
demonstrative in (1) does not translate into Eng-
lish as a stressed personal pronoun: While der in
(1) can only refer to Peter, HE in (1&apos;) is just
oddly ambiguous:
(1&apos;) Paul wanted to go running with Peter. But
HE had a cold.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.885434142857143">
Kameyama (1999) is probably right characteris-
ing the function of English stressed personal
pronouns in terms of an Alternative Semantics
approach to focus (Rooth 1992), and hence in
terms of contrast, and an analysis of stressed
German and English personal pronouns in terms
of contrast and markedness was also put forward
in Bosch (1988). The difference between per-
sonal pronouns and demonstratives in German,
however, cannot be captured along these lines:
Even though complementarity plays a role, the
category of contrast is here absent.
The basic regularity that we find in the be-
haviour of demonstratives is that they
i. choose from several antecedents (that obey
the relevant number and gender constraints
as well as subcategorisation constraints of
the relevant predicate) the one whose referent
is preferentially not at the top salience rank
(not a topic); Cf. (1), (3), (4).
ii. pick up a unique antecedent (that obeys the
relevant number and gender constraints as
well as subcategorisation constraints of the
relevant predicate), even though it stands for
the most salient referent (the topic). They
may also accommodate a generic referent
that obeys the subcategorisation constraints
of the relevant predicate (cf. (8) below). In
this condition their referential options are
identical to those of referential anaphoric
personal pronouns, except for a certain stylis-
tic markedness; cf. (2).
iii. when accompanied by a pointing gesture
they refer to a unique referent that was not
salient before.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997521">
63
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999715">
Condition (iii), even though without direct rele-
vance for written language, probably provides
the clearest intuitive understanding for the func-
tion of demonstratives: They highlight a previ-
ously non-salient referent, and in a sense they
presuppose the non-salience of their referents. —
If their reference defaults to salient discourse
entities, as under condition (ii), when no other
suitable discourse referents are available, we ob-
serve an effect of stylistic markedness: The ref-
erent is represented, as it were, as something put
at a distance. A similar effect is seen in English
when, e.g., a salient female person is referred to
as &amp;quot;that woman&amp;quot; or the current head of govern-
ment as &amp;quot;that prime minister&amp;quot;.
For the purposes of this paper we summarize
this hypothesis about the function of demonstra-
tives in the following form:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.752846">
Complementarity Hypothesis
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995695">
Anaphoric personal pronouns prefer referents
that are established as discourse topics, while
demonstratives prefer non-topical referents.
Clearly, this is a working hypothesis that needs
further elaboration, in particular with regard to
the notions of salience and topic. But it is suffi-
cient for a first validation with respect to corpus
data, provided we can make it operational.
In line with most research in the area, guided
in particular by the Keenan and Comrie&apos;s (1977)
Accessibility Hierarchy, Given&apos;s (1984:139)
Topicality Hierarchy, and Centering Theory
(Grosz e.a. 1995), we decided that noun phrases
that occur in the nominative are thereby ceteris
paribus very likely to establish their referent as a
topic for the following sentence, and that noun
phrases that are not in the nominative are less
likely to establish topics for the following sen-
tence. We disregard in this study all other pa-
rameters that may influence salience or topic-
hood, such as definiteness, referent type, voice,
or embeddedness.
Before we can check our hypothesis on corpus
data, however, we have to deal with a number of
smaller problems related to the identification of
demonstratives.

3 Identifying demonstrative uses of der
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928">
The first problem is the identification of those
occurrences of the relevant forms that are actu-
ally used as demonstratives. The forms of the
demonstrative der in German are largely identi-
cal with those of the relative pronoun and the
definite article. So, how do we identify
demonstrative uses?
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995192">
3.1 Demonstratives and definite articles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917545454545">
Demonstrative uses of der and its morphological
variants are formally identical with definite arti-
cle uses — except for the genitive and the dative
plural forms (cf. tables 1 and 2). Their gender
and number is determined either by the semantic
classification (animacy, sex) of the intended ref-
erent or by the gender and number of a (virtual or
actual) antecedent (cf. Bosch 1987:72-73).
Definite determiner occurrences always start
an NP, i.e. they are followed by an (attributive)
adjective, adverb, numeral, or noun, etc., while
demonstrative pronouns are themselves of the
category NP. Some unclarity may arise though in
cases that could look like cases of elided nouns,
as in (5) above, repeated here.

[The money should not come out of the

One might want to argue that dem is really ellip-
tical for dein Etat; and indeed the insertion of
Etat would lead to a fully acceptable paraphrase.
Still, dem can here only be analysed as a demon-
strative pronoun. The evidence comes from a
plural variant:
(5&apos;) Die Gelder sollen nicht aus den Mitteln des
Umweltministeriums, sondem aus {denenl

[The money should not come out of the
means of the Ministry of Environment, but

Here the article form den is ungrammatical and
only the demonstrative denen is acceptable. Our
claim that dem in the entirely parallel (5) is also a
demonstrative is thus born out.

3.2 Demonstrative and relative pronouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999923125">
The distinction between occurrences of the
demonstrative and occurrences of the relative
pronoun is trickier because the inventory of
forms is exactly the same. In principle there
should be a difference in their distribution
though, because German relative clauses have
sub-clause, i.e. verb-final, word order. Unfortu-
nately, there still remains an area of overlap that
is controversial on theoretic grounds (cf. Gartner
2001). We have here decided to count all and
only those pronouns from the paradigm as rela-
tives that are unambiguously distinguished as
relatives by V-final word order, plus those from
syntactically ambiguous structures with a pro-
noun plus a fmite verb. All other occurrences are
regarded as demonstratives.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998228">
We compared the occurrences of the demonstra-

the NEGRA6 corpus of written German, with
regard to their frequency and with regard to the
classification of their antecedents.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997272">
4.1 Frequency results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996">
The first observation concerns relative fre-
quency. Demonstratives are here much rarer than
personal pronouns: We counted 1436 instances
of personal pronouns and only 180 demonstra-
tives. Perhaps this proportion cannot straightfor-
wardly be generalized but is typical in any case
for written discourses and those that typically
show topic continuity, as newspaper articles do.

The possibly most striking difference between
personal and demonstrative pronouns is that the
antecedent of a demonstrative in over 90 % of all
cases is found in the same or the preceding sen-
6 NEGRA is a POS-tagged and syntactically annotated corpus of
German of 355,000 words, a subset of the Frankfurter Rundschau
corpus, which is also available as a tree bank. See http:// www. coli.
uni-sh.de/sfb378 Thegra-corpus/negra-corpus.html.
The counts include all singular and plural masculine and feminine
forms. Neuter forms were excluded because of the additional prob-
lems they cause with respect to referent type and non-NP antece-
dents.

tence, while personal pronouns refer to objects
that are introduced earlier in discourse about
twice as often (17.7% vs. 8.9%). This figure on
its own already gives initial support to the hy-
pothesis that personal pronouns more likely
than demonstratives pick up referents that have
the status of a topic: Topics are usually main-
tained over more than one sentence.
Tables 3 and 4 also show that there is an
about equal proportion of occurrences for both
pronoun classes that have a sentence-internal
antecedent. And we can also clearly see where
antecedents are preferentially located: for per-
sonal pronouns in nominative NPs in the preced-
ing sentence and for demonstratives in non-
nominatives. This would confirm our hypothesis
regarding the complementarity of personal and
demonstrative pronouns.
The figures in tables 3 and 4 are not ideal for
a comparison though. For two reasons: (a) they
include demonstratives that have their antece-
dents neither in the same sentence nor in the pre-
ceding sentence, and (b) they include personal
pronouns that have their antecedents in the same
sentence. — The first case poses a problem with
regard to antecedents further back in discourse,
of which there are practically none. The figure
almost exclusively rests on cases where actually
no antecedent could not be found in the last three
preceding sentences; and these are demonstra-
tives that accommodate their referents. An typi-
cal example is the following:
ferent for personal and demonstrative pronouns.
Hence this class should be discarded for a quanti-
tative comparison and should be treated sepa-
rately.
The other set of figures we should ignore in a
quantitative comparison are those that have to
do with sentence-internal pronouns. Here the
point is that personal pronouns frequently do not
function referentially when their antecedent is in
the same sentence, while demonstrative pronouns
are referential in all their occurrences. Personal
pronouns, next to their referential occurrences,
also have &amp;quot;bound&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;syntactic&amp;quot; occurrences (cf.
Reinhart 1983; Bosch 1983) as in the following
sentences
</bodyText>

or their German equivalents
(9&apos;) Niemand dachte, er wiirde es schaffen.
(10&apos;) Fred ffihlte sich krank, als er zuriickkam.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.947614416666667">
The personal pronouns in these sentences (on the
intended interpretation) are not independently
referential items and hence their job obviously
cannot be done by (referential) demonstrative
pronouns:
(9n) Niemand dachte, der wiirde es schaffen.
(8) Jetzt, wo hier auf einmal an jedem Feldweg
jemand Blumen verkauft, wollen die uns ver-
treiben.
[Now, where there is suddenly someone sell-
ing flowers along each country lane, they [the
authorities] want to chase us away.]
Although this kind of accommodating use is pos-
sible also for personal pronoun forms, the domi-
nant case among pronouns referring to an
antecedent &amp;quot;earlier in discourse&amp;quot; is just straight-
forward anaphora. But this means that the pa-
rameters governing the class of references to
antecedents &amp;quot;earlier in discourse&amp;quot; are quite dif-
8 We must add that we counted cases of accommodated referents
and occurrences for which no antecedent could be recovered among
those where the antecedent was not in the same or the preceding
sentence.
(10&amp;quot;) Fred ffihlte sich hank, als der zurack-
kam.
The occurrences of der here cannot be inter-
preted the same way as the personal pronouns
before, but must refer to a person introduced
elsewhere in discourse. We find a similar effect
in English with stressed personal pronouns:
(9m) Nobody thought HE would make it.
(10&amp;quot;) Fred felt sick, when HE returned.
Syntactic occurrences of personal pronouns
are in a relation of congruence or agreement with
an NP that c-commands them and not in a rela-
tion of co-reference (cf. Bosch 1983). Although
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.967378">
66
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999722857142857">
not all personal pronouns with an explicit ante-
cedent in the same sentence are syntactic pro-
nouns, a large proportion is. And since this mode
of operation is unavailable for demonstratives,
we should not include sentence-internal pro-
nouns when we are interested in comparing op-
tions for referent choice and had better focus on
the area where personal pronouns and demon-
stratives actually compete: when they have ante-
cedents in the previous sentence.
If we discount antecedents earlier in discourse
and in the same sentence and take the uses with
an antecedent in the previous sentence as 100%,
the figures look as in tables 5 and 6.

These tables show the complementary function
of personal and demonstrative pronouns clearer
than tables 3 and 4. Personal pronouns have an-
tecedents in the nominative in the overwhelming
majority of cases, while demonstratives rather
look for non-norninatives. — If our assumption is
right that the nominative signals topicality of the
referent of an NP, or a high rank in the atten-
tional structure of discourse, and non-nomina-
tives signal non-topicality, or a lower rank in the
attentional structure, then these results have a
clear theoretical interpretation that follows our
discussion in Section 2.
The complementarity documented in tables 5
and 6 is not perfect, however. What are the dis-
turbing factors? First, we should recall that we
used a pretty coarse operationalization of the no-
tions of salience and topic that ignores a number
of potentially relevant parameters, such as defi-
niteness, voice, embeddedness, or reference type.
Then, as already mentioned above, there is the
use under which a demonstrative refers to the
topic of the preceding sentence, which is accom-
panied by a certain stylistic effect. These are
cases where there is only one grammatically
suitable antecedent. Thirdly, there are factors that
would make personal pronouns prefer non-topics
as referents, e.g. strategies of parallel interpreta-
tion. And, finally, although this is comparatively
rare in newspaper corpora, we find cases in
which world knowledge simply dictates an inter-
pretation that runs counter to what the grammar
of the pronouns make us expect, i.e. badly writ-
ten text. — All of these factors require further in-
vestigation.

5 Conclusion and further work

<bodyText confidence="0.999990647058824">
From the data presented it would appear that our
Complementarity Hypothesis is well supported:
while personal pronouns prefer topic referents,
demonstrative pronouns prefer referents that are
not topical. This raises a number of issues that
need further investigation. Among them the
question about the interaction of the case pa-
rameter for salience with other parameters. This
issue is investigated in psycholinguistic experi-
ments we are now running. Further there is a
great need to study the intrasentential division of
labour between personal and demonstrative pro-
nouns, which involves, in particular, closer atten-
tion to the relation between relatives and
demonstratives. A large area of investigation, for
which we do not currently have suitable corpora,
is the question of how the regularity we have
found for newspaper texts carry over to other
discourse types, in particular spoken discourse.
In this context also the parameter of stress needs
further research, which plays (nearly) no role in
written text, but influences reference options for
German demonstratives just as it does for per-
sonal pronouns in English and German. — An-
other, and somewhat different, line of
development is the application of results from
this line of research to computational reference
resolution. We believe that the contrastive inves-
tigation of reference options of different lexical
forms, as here demonstratives vs personal pro-
nouns, may be particularly useful in developing
further constraints also for the reference resolu-
tion of the vastly more popular personal pro-
nouns, even when reference resolution for

<abstract confidence="0.99845275">This paper deals with the distribution and reference of the German demonstrative its case and gender variants, in comparison with the behaviour of personal pronouns. After introducing the relevant facts about both pronoun types, develop our Hyclaims that demonstratives differ from personal pronouns mainly in that they prefer less salient referents. The hypothesis is tested against a newspaper corpus and is found to be fundamentally correct. The paper concludes with the discussion of the empirical results and their effect for future work.</abstract>

(10&amp;quot;) Fred ffihlte sich hank, als der zurackkam. The occurrences of der here cannot be interpreted the same way as the personal pronouns before, but must refer to a person introduced elsewhere in discourse. We find a similar effect in English with stressed personal pronouns: (9m) Nobody thought HE would make it. (10&amp;quot;) Fred felt sick, when HE returned. Syntactic occurrences of personal pronouns are in a relation of congruence or agreement with an NP that c-commands them and not in a relation of co-reference (cf. Bosch 1983). Although 66 not all personal pronouns with an explicit antecedent in the same sentence are syntactic pronouns, a large proportion is. And since this mode of operation is unavailable for demonstratives, we should not include sentence-internal pronouns when we are interested in comparing options for referent choice and had better focus on the area where personal pronouns and demonstratives actually compete: when they have antecedents in the previous sentence. If we discount antecedents earlier in discourse and in the same sentence and take the uses with an antecedent in the previous sentence a</context>

The forms of the demonstrative der in German are largely identical with those of the relative pronoun and the definite article. So, how do we identify demonstrative uses? 3.1 Demonstratives and definite articles Demonstrative uses of der and its morphological variants are formally identical with definite article uses — except for the genitive and the dative plural forms (cf. tables 1 and 2). Their gender and number is determined either by the semantic classification (animacy, sex) of the intended referent or by the gender and number of a (virtual or actual) antecedent (cf. Bosch 1987:72-73). Definite determiner occurrences always start an NP, i.e. they are followed by an (attributive) adjective, adverb, numeral, or noun, etc., while demonstrative pronouns are themselves of the category NP. Some unclarity may arise though in cases that could look like cases of elided nouns, as in (5) above, repeated here. sing plur masc fern neut m/f/n nom der die das die gen dessen deren dessen deren/ derer5 dat dem der dem denen acc den die das die Table 1: Forms of the demonstrative pronoun sing plur masc fern neut m/f/n nom der die das die gen des der des der dat dem der dem den acc de</context>

The difference between personal pronouns and demonstratives in German, however, cannot be captured along these lines: Even though complementarity plays a role, the category of contrast is here absent.

The interesting point about German demonstratives in this connection is that they allow for a fairly direct comparison of pronominal anaphoric and demonstrative reference in a way this comparison is not possible for other languages. In English we could look at differences between it, this, and that. But here the range of potential referents brings in a number of additional complications (cf. Passonneau 1989, Webber 1991, Eckert &amp; Strube 2000) that are avoided when we compare personal and demonstrative pronouns in German. This paper takes a few modest steps towards an account of the distribution and reference of demonstratives, but what we have to offer is still work in progress. We have not yet looked at all forms of the demonstrative. What we have worked out so far is an hypothesis about the distinction between different uses of the demonstrative and personal pronouns, and we have put this hypothesis to the test with a small 350,000 word corpus of written German. 3 The Verbmobil corpus of spoken German (http:// verbmobil.dfki.de/</context>

Our claim that dem in the entirely parallel (5) is also a demonstrative is thus born out. 3.2 Demonstrative and relative pronouns The distinction between occurrences of the demonstrative and occurrences of the relative pronoun is trickier because the inventory of forms is exactly the same. In principle there should be a difference in their distribution though, because German relative clauses have sub-clause, i.e. verb-final, word order. Unfortunately, there still remains an area of overlap that is controversial on theoretic grounds (cf. Gartner 2001). We have here decided to count all and only those pronouns from the paradigm as relatives that are unambiguously distinguished as relatives by V-final word order, plus those from syntactically ambiguous structures with a pronoun plus a fmite verb. All other occurrences are regarded as demonstratives. 4 Empirical results We compared the occurrences of the demonstrative with those of the personal pronoun forms in the NEGRA6 corpus of written German, with regard to their frequency and with regard to the classification of their antecedents. 4.1 Frequency results The first observation concerns rel</context>

But the distinction between German personal and demonstrative pronouns is not the same. The demonstrative in (1) does not translate into English as a stressed personal pronoun: While der in (1) can only refer to Peter, HE in (1&apos;) is just oddly ambiguous: (1&apos;) Paul wanted to go running with Peter. But HE had a cold. Kameyama (1999) is probably right characterising the function of English stressed personal pronouns in terms of an Alternative Semantics approach to focus (Rooth 1992), and hence in terms of contrast, and an analysis of stressed German and English personal pronouns in terms of contrast and markedness was also put forward in Bosch (1988). The difference between personal pronouns and demonstratives in German, however, cannot be captured along these lines: Even though complementarity plays a role, the category of contrast is here absent. The basic regularity that we find in the behaviour of demonstratives is that they i. choose from several antecedents (that obey the relevant number and gender constraints as well as subcategorisation constraints of the relevan</context>

In a large German newspaper corpus 94.8% of all occurrences of der were found to be occurrences of the definite article, a further 4.8% were occurrences of the relative pronoun, and a mere 0.4% were occurrences of the demonstrative pronoun2. Because of its clear deictic potential, similar to English this or that, one might think that the demonstrative would be more frequent in spoken language. But an unbiased comparison would require written and spoken corpora of the same discourse type, which 1 An example is the tree tagger by Helmut Schmid (1994). 2 These figures are based on a 41 Mio word corpus of Frankfurter Rundschau, a German national daily newspaper. 61 we have not been able to acquire. So we have to leave this point to speculation3. So, why would one want a computational identification of demonstratives, and why would one want a better understanding of their reference? On the one hand, there is of course the motivation from applications, similar as for all other work on reference resolution: A treatment of demonstratives is clearly needed, e.g., for machine translation. Nearly no German demonstrative can be adequately translate</context>

The interesting point about German demonstratives in this connection is that they allow for a fairly direct comparison of pronominal anaphoric and demonstrative reference in a way this comparison is not possible for other languages. In English we could look at differences between it, this, and that. But here the range of potential referents brings in a number of additional complications (cf. Passonneau 1989, Webber 1991, Eckert &amp; Strube 2000) that are avoided when we compare personal and demonstrative pronouns in German. This paper takes a few modest steps towards an account of the distribution and reference of demonstratives, but what we have to offer is still work in progress. We have not yet looked at all forms of the demonstrative. What we have worked out so far is an hypothesis about the distinction between different uses of the demonstrative and personal pronouns, and we have put this hypothesis to the test with a small 350,000 word corpus of written German. 3 The Verbmobil corpus of spoken German (htt</context>
