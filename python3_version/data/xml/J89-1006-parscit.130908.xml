although it works for his examples, might not adapt
itself to more complex problems like negation in
French.
Karen Jensen (&amp;quot;Binary rules and nonbinary trees:
Breaking down the concept of phrase structure&amp;quot;) is
concerned with the passage from binary rules (and
trees) that capture significant generalizations about nat-
ural languages to list structures that are more satisfac-
tory for further processing. Her solution can handle
discontinuous constituents and is suitable for treating
languages with free word order.
In &amp;quot;The notion of &apos;rule of grammar&apos; reconsidered&amp;quot;
Michael Kac defends the notion that &amp;quot;grammatical
analysis requires that we have a way of formally repre-
senting the variety of distinct etiological properties that
can be manifested by ungrammatical strings, this diver-
sity corresponding to the variety of distinct rules of
grammar&amp;quot; (p. 137). He argues that getting the standard
linguistic theories (various versions of TG, GPSG, etc.)
to serve the purpose of etiological analysis is &amp;quot;problem-
atical&amp;quot;. His &amp;quot;fundamental principles&amp;quot; (pp. 120, 122)
appear to require that a grammar supply a structure not
only for elements of the language L that it generates but
also for the elements in the complement of L. In his
formal development, however, he defines an object
(Definition 9) in terms of itself and this circularity would
appear to render the result ill-defined. Since his main
argument depends on this definition, I stopped reading.
It is a good practice to buttress complicated definitions
with examples both for the good of the writer as well as
that of the reader.
There are three papers on tree-adjoining grammars:
an introduction by Joshi, &amp;quot;Unbounded dependencies
and subjacency in a tree adjoining grammar&amp;quot; by A.S.
Kroch, and &amp;quot;On the progression from context-free to
tree adjoining languages&amp;quot; by Joshi et al. This presents
an easy access to a useful collection of results concern-
ing a rather pregnant linguistic model.
Finally, three of the papers are concerned with
semantics proper. G.N. Carlson&apos;s &amp;quot;Exceptions to ge-
neric generalizations&amp;quot; deals with the construction of a
formal semantics using a sort of default mechanism in
order to interpret statements like &amp;quot;Dogs bark&amp;quot; when
clearly barkless dogs exist. Davis and Papcun in &amp;quot;The
structure underlying a semantic domain&amp;quot; provide a
rather metaphorical model yr (volumetric representa-
tion) &amp;quot;to formalize lexical knowledge in a practical
way&amp;quot;. They investigate various models—semantic net-
works, multi-dimensional scaling, and clustering—be-
fore settling on their own spatial (and somewhat inten-
sional) model of a semantic domain. The third paper,
R.H. Thomason&apos;s &amp;quot;Remarks on linguistic semantics&amp;quot;,
is an expository article concerned with the interface
between linguistics and philosophy, dealing with the
literature of such topics as tense and aspect, proposi-
tional attitudes, and vagueness.

This book is an extended argument in support of the
theses that natural languages are transfinitely un-
bounded collections, that sentences are not limited in
length (number of words) by any cardinal number, finite
or transfinite, and that no constructive grammar can be
an adequate grammar for any natural language.
Chapter 1 is an introduction to those aspects of set
theory needed to develop the main points of the book.
Specifically, the notion of a class arising from Cantor&apos;s
and Russell&apos;s paradoxes and the Cantor power set are
introduced.
Chapter 2 sets forth what the authors call the &amp;quot;re-
ceived position about natural languages&amp;quot; (hereafter
NLs). The received position is that NL sentences are
finite in length. Length is defined in terms of number of
words, although the authors argue later that we could
just as well count phonemes as words without seriously
affecting their arguments. NLs as collections of finite-
length sentences are therefore countably infinite (or
denumerable). Finally, related to the finiteness of sen-
tences is the &amp;quot;received position&amp;quot; that grammars for
NLs are constructive.
Chapter 3 argues that there is &amp;quot;no motivation for
imposing size laws on NL sentences&amp;quot; (p. 44). Invoking
Occam&apos;s Razor, the authors claim that size laws are
extra-linguistic restrictions not needed for grammatical
description and therefore unjustified.
Chapter 4 presents the main theoretical points of the
book. Taking as axiomatic for NLs a property of
coordination that allows for unrestricted coordinate
compounding of sentences, the authors present the NL
Vastness Theorem, which asserts that NLs are not sets,
but rather classes with no fixed cardinality. The argu-
ment can be illustrated with their example (pp. 55-57):
I. Let L be the NL English.
2. The set So is contained in L, where
So = {Babar is happy; I know that Babar is happy;
I know that I know that Babar is happy; . . .}

3. S1 may be constructed as follows.
a. Form the set of all subsets of So, P(S0).
b. For each element B in P(S0), form the sentence
that is the coordinate conjunction of all the sen-
tences in B.
c. Let SI be the collection of all sentences formed
in (3b).

Si =-- {Babar is happy; I know that Babar is happy;
I know that I know that Babar is happy; .
Babar is happy and I know that Babar is happy;
Babar is happy and I know that I know that Babar
is happy;. . . ; Babar is happy, I know that Babar
is happy, and I know that I know that Babar is
happy;. . .}

<listItem confidence="0.885672">
4. So is denumerable, but SI, which is equinumerous
with P(So) is not denumerable (by Cantor&apos;s Theo-
rem).
5. S2, S3, etc., can be constructed analogously. Each
successive S has a greater transfinite cardinality
than the one preceding it.
6. All of the S collections are contained within L.
7. L has no fixed cardinality.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995201693333334">
Although this particular construction shows that the
cardinality of L is not fixed by any weakly inaccessible
cardinal in the sequence X (see Monk 1969), the authors
later imply that their result holds for strongly inacces-
sible cardinals as well. A notable corollary to this
example is that sentences in L have no upper length
bound. Indeed, at least one sentence in S1 has length c,
the power of the continuum.
Chapter 5 presents some implications of the NL
Vastness Theorem. The implication of most interest to
computational linguists is probably the NL Non-Con-
structivity Theorem (p. 72), which states that no NL has
any constructive grammar. This theorem, Langendoen
and Postal assert, immediately invalidates any genera-
tive, proof-theoretic, or Turing machine grammar for
natural languages. The authors list 27 invalidated theo-
ries (including LFG, GPSG, GB, systemic grammar,
and tagmemics). All that remain uninvalidated are
Johnson and Postal&apos;s (1980) arc pair grammar (which
is mentioned) and perhaps Foley and van Valin&apos;s
(1984) role and reference grammar (which is not men-
tioned).
Chapters 6 and 7 assert that transfinite sentences do
not contradict any linguistic principles of sentencehood,
nor is the concept of transfinite sentences invalidated by
any existing linguistic ontology, conceptualism, or pla-
tonism. Finally, the authors assert that no linguistic
principle relevant for the characterization of finite sen-
tences fails to be relevant for transfinite ones.
The vastness of natural languages is a fascinating
monograph that takes the formalist approach to human
languages to its absurd, yet logical, conclusions. The
arguments supporting the NL Vastness Theorem are
logically valid, but there continues to be something not
quite right about statements like &amp;quot;consider then a
denumerably long transfinite German sentence with
infinitely many underlying voiced word-final stops&amp;quot; (p.
76). This conflict between what can be logically de-
duced and what actually is goes to the heart of this book
and its relevance for formal linguists and computational
linguists.
Langendoen and Postal offer here a kind of reverse
parallel reaction of the kind Brouwer and the intuition-
ists offered against formalism in the foundations of
mathematics (see Hatcher 1982). The intuitionists at-
tacked the notion that a contradiction resulting from the
assumption of the nonexistence of a mathematical ob-
ject entailed a proof of its existence. Langendoen and
Postal heartily embrace this principle and apply it to
natural languages. In this respect, this book offers a
much-needed serious discussion on the foundations of
formal linguistics. It shows that within the formalist
paradigm, theory builders and natural language process-
ing program writers are logically at odds with each
other. Computational linguists must, by definition, be
constructivists. On the other hand, theory builders, as is
shown in this book, cannot be.
For the computational linguist, one important criti-
cism of this book lies in the relationship between natural
languages and Langendoen and Postal&apos;s NLs. It is not
clear that the set-theoretic NLs are indeed natural
languages. Perhaps a human language, like English, is
no more than a restriction of some sort of the NL-
English. Indeed, NL-English may have sentences with
length the cardinality of the continuum, but the English
that is used by humans or modeled by computer pro-
grams need not. Even if all constructive grammars of
English are invalid as grammars for NL-English, these
grammars may be quite adequate for expert systems,
speech processing, etc.
The vastness of natural languages is a well-argued
and thought-provoking book. It should be of interest to
anyone interested in the foundations of linguistic the-
ory, although its effects on computational linguistic
practice may be minimal.
