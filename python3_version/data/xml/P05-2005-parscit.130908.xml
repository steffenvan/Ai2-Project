Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999658533333333">
In this work we present a method for
Named Entity Recognition (NER). Our
method does not rely on complex linguis-
tic resources, and apart from a hand coded
system, we do not use any language-
dependent tools. The only information
we use is automatically extracted from the
documents, without human intervention.
Moreover, the method performs well even
without the use of the hand coded system.
The experimental results are very encour-
aging. Our approach even outperformed
the hand coded system on NER in Span-
ish, and it achieved high accuracies in Por-
tuguese.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902285714286">
Given the usefulness of Named Entities (NEs) in
many natural language processing tasks, there has
been a lot of work aimed at developing accurate
named entity extractors (Borthwick, 1999; Velardi et
al., 2001; Ar´evalo et al., 2002; Zhou and Su, 2002;
Florian, 2002; Zhang and Johnson, 2003). Most ap-
proaches however, have very low portability, they
are designed to perform well over a particular collec-
tion or type of document, and their accuracies will
drop considerably when used in different domains.
The reason for this is that many NE extractor sys-
tems rely heavily on complex linguistic resources,
which are typically hand coded, for example regu-
lar expressions, grammars, gazetteers and the like.
</bodyText>

Adapting a system of this nature to a different col-
lection or language requires a lot of human effort,
involving tasks such as rewriting the grammars, ac-
quiring new dictionaries, searching trigger words,
and so on. Even if one has the human resources and
the time needed for the adaptation process, there are
languages that lack the linguistic resources needed,
for instance, dictionaries are available in electronic
form for only a handful of languages. We believe
that, by using machine learning techniques, we can
adapt an existing hand coded system to different do-
mains and languages with little human effort.
Our goal is to present a method that will facilitate
the task of increasing the coverage of named entity
extractor systems. In this setting, we assume that
we have available an NE extractor system for Span-
ish, and we want to adapt it so that it can perform
NER accurately in documents from a different lan-
guage, namely Portuguese. It is important to empha-
size here that we try to avoid the use of complex and
costly linguistic tools or techniques, besides the ex-
isting NER system, given the language restrictions
they pose. Although, we do need a corpus of the
target language. However, we consider the task of
gathering a corpus much easier and faster than that
of developing linguistic tools such as parsers, part-
of-speech taggers, grammars and the like.
In the next section we present some recent work
related to NER. Section 3 describes the data sets
used in our experiments. Section 4 introduces our
approach to NER, and we conclude in Section 5 giv-
ing a brief discussion of our findings and proposing
research lines for future work.

There has been a lot of work on NER, and there is a
remarkable trend towards the use of machine learn-
ing algorithms. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are
a common choice in this setting. For instance, Zhou
and Su trained HMM with a set of attributes combin-
ing internal features such as gazetteer information,
and external features such as the context of other
NEs already recognized (Zhou and Su, 2002). (Bikel
et al., 1997) and (Bikel et al., 1999) are other exam-
ples of the use of HMMs.
Previous methods for increasing the coverage
of hand coded systems include that of Borthwick,
he used a maximum entropy approach where he
combined the output of three hand coded systems
with dictionaries and other orthographic information
(Borthwick, 1999). He also adapted his system to
perform NER in Japanese achieving impressive re-
sults.
Spanish resources for NER have been used pre-
viously to perform NER on a different language.
Carreras et al. presented results of a NER system
for Catalan using Spanish resources (Carreras et al.,
2003a). They explored several methods for build-
ing NER for Catalan. Their best results are achieved
using cross-linguistic features. In this method the
NER system is trained on mixed corpora and per-
forms reasonably well on both languages. Our work
follows Carreras et al. approach, but differs in that
we apply directly the NER system for Spanish to
Portuguese and train a classifier using the output and
the real classes.
In (Petasis et al., 2000) a new method for automat-
ing the task of extending a proper noun dictionary is
presented. The method combines two learning ap-
proaches: an inductive decision-tree classifier and
unsupervised probabilistic learning of syntactic and
semantic context. The attributes selected for the ex-
periments include POS tags as well as morphologi-
cal information whenever available.
One work focused on NE recognition for Span-
ish is based on discriminating among different kinds
of named entities: core NEs, which contain a trig-
ger word as nucleus, syntactically simple weak
NEs, formed by single noun phrases, and syntacti-
cally complex named entities, comprised of complex
noun phrases. Ar´evalo and colleagues focused on
the first two kinds of NEs (Ar´evalo et al., 2002). The
method is a sequence of processes that uses simple
attributes combined with external information pro-
vided by gazetteers and lists of trigger words. A
context free grammar, manually coded, is used for
recognizing syntactic patterns.

In this paper we report results of experimenting with
two data sets. The corpus in Spanish is that used
in the CoNLL 2002 competitions for the NE extrac-
tion task. This corpus is divided into three sets: a
training set consisting of 20,308 NEs and two differ-
ent sets for testing, testa which has 4,634 NEs and
testb with 3,948 NEs, the former was designated to
tune the parameters of the classifiers (development
set), while testb was designated to compare the re-
sults of the competitors. We performed experiments
with testa only.
For evaluating NER on Portuguese we used the
corpus provided by “HAREM: Evaluation contest
on named entity recognition for Portuguese”. This
corpus contains newspaper articles and consists of
8,551 words with 648 NEs.

Our approach to NER consists in dividing the prob-
lem into two subproblems that are addressed sequen-
tially. We first solve the problem of determining
boundaries of named entities, we called this process
Named Entity Delimitation (NED). Once we have
determined which words belong to named entities,
we then get to the task of classifying the named en-
tities into categories, this process is what we called
Named Entity Classification (NEC). We explain the
two procedures in the following subsections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990927">
4.1 Named Entity Delimitation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993525">
We used the BIO scheme for delimiting named enti-
ties. In this approach each word in the text is labeled
with one out of three possible classes: The B tag is
assigned to words believed to be the beginning of a
NE, the I tag is for words that belong to an entity
but that are not at the beginning, and the O tag is for
all words that do not satisfy any of the previous two
conditions.

In our approach, NED is tackled as a learning
task. The features used as attributes are automati-
cally extracted from the documents and are used to
train a machine learning algorithm. We used a mod-
ified version of C4.5 algorithm (Quinlan, 1993) im-
plemented within the WEKA environment (Witten
and Frank, 1999).
For each word we combined two types of fea-
tures: internal and external; we consider as inter-
nal features the word itself, orthographic informa-
tion and the position in the sentence. The external
features are provided by the hand coded NER system
for Spanish, these are the Part-of-Speech tag and the
BIO tag. Then, the attributes for a given word w are
extracted using a window of five words anchored in
the word w, each word described by the internal and
external features mentioned previously.
Within the orthographic information we consider
6 possible states of a word. A value of 1 in this at-
tribute means that the letters in the word are all cap-
italized. A value of 2 means the opposite: all letters
are lower case. The value 3 is for words that have the
initial letter capitalized. 4 means the word has dig-
its, 5 is for punctuation marks and 6 refers to marks
representing the beginning and end of sentences.
The hand coded system used in this work was de-
veloped by the TALP research center (Carreras and
Padr´o, 2002). They have developed a set of NLP an-
alyzers for Spanish, English and Catalan that include
practical tools such as POS taggers, semantic ana-
lyzers and NE extractors. This NER system is based
on hand-coded grammars, lists of trigger words and
gazetteer information.
In contrast to other methods we do not perform bi-
nary classifications, as (Carreras et al., 2003b), thus
we do not build specialized classifiers for each of the
tags. Our classifier learns to discriminate among the
three classes and assigns labels to all the words, pro-
cessing them sequentially. In Table 1 we present an
example taken from the data used in the experiments
where internal and external features are extracted for
each word in a sentence.

4.1.1 Experimental Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993514285714">
For all results reported here we show the overall
average of several runs of 10-fold cross-validation.
We used common measures from information re-
trieval: precision, recall and F1 and we present re-
sults from individual classes as we believe it is im-
portant in a learning setting such as this, where
nearly 90% of the instances belong to one class.
Table 2 presents comparative results using the
Spanish corpus. We show four different sets of re-
sults, the first ones are from the hand coded sys-
tem, they are labeled NER system for Spanish. Then
we present results of training a classifier with only
the internal features described above, these results
are labeled Internal features. In a third experiment
we trained the classifier using only the output of the
NER system, these are under column External fea-
tures. Finally, the results of our system are presented
in column labeled Our method. We can see that even
though the NER system performs very well by it-
self, by training the C4.5 algorithm on its outputs we
improve performance in all the cases, with the ex-
ception of precision for class B. Given that the hand
coded system was built for this collection, it is very
encouraging to see our method outperforming this
system. In Table 3 we show results of applying our
method to the Portuguese corpus. In this case the
improvements are much more impressive, particu-
larly for class B, in all the cases the best results are
obtained from our technique. This was expected as
we are using a system developed for a different lan-
guage. But we can see that our method yields very
competitive results for Portuguese, and although by
using only the internal features we can outperform
the hand coded system, by combining the informa-
tion using our method we can increase accuracies.

From the results presented above, it is clear that
the method can perform NED in Spanish and Por-
tuguese with very high accuracy. Another insight
suggested by these results is that in order to perform
NED in Portuguese we do not need an existing NED
system for Spanish, the internal features performed
well by themselves, but if we have one available,
we can use the information provided by it to build
a more accurate NED method.

4.2 Named Entity Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998095">
As mentioned previously, we build our NE classi-
fiers using the output of a hand coded system. Our
assumption is that by using machine learning algo-
rithms we can improve performance of NE extrac-
tors without a considerable effort, as opposed to that
involved in extending or rewriting grammars and
lists of trigger words and gazetteers. Another as-
sumption underlying this approach is that of believ-
ing that the misclassifications of the hand coded sys-
tem for Spanish will not affect the learner. We be-
lieve that by having available the correct NE classes
in the training corpus, the learner will be capable of
generalizing error patterns that will be used to as-
sign the correct NE. If this assumption holds, learn-
ing from other’s mistakes, the learner will end up
outperforming the hand coded system.
In order to build a training set for the learner, each
instance is described with the same attributes as for
the NED task described in section 4.1, with the addi-
tion of a new attribute. Since NEC is a more difficult
task, we consider useful adding as attribute the suf-
fix of each word. Then, for each instance word we
consider its suffix, with a maximum size of 5 char-
acters.
Another important difference between this clas-
sification task and NED relies in the set of target
values. For the Spanish corpus the possible class
values are the same as those used in CoNLL-2002
competition task: person, organization, location and
miscellaneous. However, for the Portuguese corpus
we have 10 possible classes: person, object, quan-
tity, event, organization, artifact, location, date, ab-
straction and miscellaneous. Thus the task of adapt-
ing the system for Spanish to perform NEC in Por-
tuguese is much more complex than that of NED
given that the Spanish system only discerns the four
NE classes defined on the CoNLL-2002. Regardless
of this, we believe that the learner will be capable
of achieving good accuracies by using the other at-
tributes in the learning task.

Similarly to the NED case we trained C4.5 clas-

bles 4 and 5. Again, we perform comparisons be-
tween the hand coded system and the use of different
subsets of attributes. For the case of Spanish NEC,
we can see in Table 4, that our method using internal
and external features presents the best results. The
improvements are impressive, specially for the NE
class Miscellaneous where the hand coded system
achieved an F measure below 1 while our system
achieved an F measure of 56.7. In the case of NEC
in Portuguese the results are very encouraging. The

hand coded system performed poorly but by training
a C4.5 algorithm results are improved considerably,
even for the classes that the hand coded system was
not capable of recognizing. As expected, the exter-
nal features did not solve the NEC by themselves but
contribute for improving the performance. This, and
the results from using only internal features, suggest
that we do not need complex linguistic resources in
order to achieve good results. Additionally, we can
see that for some cases the classifiers were not able
of performing an accurate classification, as in the
case of classes object and miscellaneous. This may
be due to a poor representation of the classes in the
training set, for instance the class object has only 4
instances. We believe that if we have more instances
available the learners will improve these results.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987760869565">
Named entities have a wide usage in natural lan-
guage processing tasks. For instance, it has been
shown that indexing NEs within documents can help
increase precision of information retrieval systems
(Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001). Other applications
of NEs are in Question Answering (Mann, 2002;
P´erez-Couti˜no et al., 2004) and Machine Translation
(Babych and Hartley, 2003). Thus it is important to
have accurate NER systems, but these systems must
be easy to port and robust, given the great variety of
documents and languages for which it is desirable to
have these tools available.
In this work we have presented a method for per-
forming named entity recognition. The method uses
a hand coded system and a set of lexical and or-
thographic features to train a machine learning al-
gorithm. Apart from the hand coded system our
method does not require any language dependent
features, we do not make use of lists of trigger
words, neither we use any gazetteer information.
The only information used in this approach is auto-
matically extracted from the documents, without hu-
man intervention. Yet, the results presented here are
very encouraging. We were able to achieve good ac-
curacies for NEC in Portuguese, where we needed to
classify NEs into 10 possible classes, by exploiting
a hand-coded system for Spanish targeted to only 4
classes. This achievement gives evidence of the flex-
ibility of our method. Additionally we outperform
the hand coded system on NER in Spanish. Thus,
our method has shown to be robust and easy to port
to other languages. The only requirement for using
our method is a tokenizer for languages that do not
separate words with white spaces, the rest can be
used pretty straightforward.
We are interested in exploring the use of this
method to perform NER in English, we would like
to determine to what extent our system is capable
of achieving competitive results without the use of
language dependent resources, such as dictionaries
and lists of words. Another research direction is the
adaptation of this method to cross language NER.
We are very interested in exploring if, by training
a classifier with mixed language corpora, we can
perform NER in more than one language simulta-
neously.

This may be due to a poor representation of the classes in the training set, for instance the class object has only 4 instances. We believe that if we have more instances available the learners will improve these results. 5 Conclusions Named entities have a wide usage in natural language processing tasks. For instance, it has been shown that indexing NEs within documents can help increase precision of information retrieval systems (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001). Other applications of NEs are in Question Answering (Mann, 2002; P´erez-Couti˜no et al., 2004) and Machine Translation (Babych and Hartley, 2003). Thus it is important to have accurate NER systems, but these systems must be easy to port and robust, given the great variety of documents and languages for which it is desirable to have these tools available. In this work we have presented a method for performing named entity recognition. The method uses a hand coded system and a set of lexical and orthographic features to train a machine learning algorithm. Apart from the hand coded system our method does not require any language dependent features, we do not make use of lists of trigger words, neither we use any gazetteer information. The</context>

The method combines two learning approaches: an inductive decision-tree classifier and unsupervised probabilistic learning of syntactic and semantic context. The attributes selected for the experiments include POS tags as well as morphological information whenever available.

The features used as attributes are automatically extracted from the documents and are used to train a machine learning algorithm. We used a modified version of C4.5 algorithm (Quinlan, 1993) implemented within the WEKA environment (Witten and Frank, 1999). For each word we combined two types of features: internal and external; we consider as internal features the word itself, orthographic information and the position in the sentence. The external features are provided by the hand coded NER system for Spanish, these are the Part-of-Speech tag and the BIO tag. Then, the attributes for a given word w are extracted using a window of five words anchored in the word w, each word described by the internal and external features mentioned previously. Within the orthographic information we consider 6 possible states of a word. A value of 1 in this attri</context>

Proceedings of the ACL Student Research Workshop, pages 25–30, Ann Arbor, Michigan, June 2005. c�2005 Association for Computational Linguistics 2 Related Work There has been a lot of work on NER, and there is a remarkable trend towards the use of machine learning algorithms. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are a common choice in this setting. For instance, Zhou and Su trained HMM with a set of attributes combining internal features such as gazetteer information, and external features such as the context of other NEs already recognized (Zhou and Su, 2002). (Bikel et al., 1997) and (Bikel et al., 1999) are other examples of the use of HMMs. Previous methods for increasing the coverage of hand coded systems include that of Borthwick, he used a maximum entropy approach where he combined the output of three hand coded systems with dictionaries and other orthographic information (Borthwick, 1999). He also adapted his system to perform NER in Japanese achieving impressive results. Spanish resources for NER have been used previously to perform NER on a different language.
