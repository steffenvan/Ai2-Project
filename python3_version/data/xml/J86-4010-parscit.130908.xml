Penman is scheduled for use in an expert-system
explanation context whose details are yet to be deter-
mined. We will study what functionality is required in
FCCBMP. The study will lead to a design of code for this
use of Penman. Implementation and demonstration of
full functionality are expected following the user assist-
ance work.

SPECIAL CL ISSUE ON COMPUTATIONAL
APPROACHES TO TENSE AND ASPECT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972159842105263">
The central problem facing long-standing attempts by
linguists and philosophers to account for the meaning of
temporal and aspectual expressions in natural languages
is that their semantics seems to be inextricably linked to
more general processes of understanding discourse and
other events in a changing world. Recently, computa-
tional linguists have joined in the fray, with the result
that computational solutions have begun to be proposed.
In light of these developments, it seems appropriate to
devote a special issue of Computational Linguistics to
this important topic. Bonnie Lynn Webber has agreed to
serve as guest editor.
Three copies of the manuscript should be sent to
