Karen Sp¨arck Jones died peacefully on 4 April 2007 after a number of months battling
cancer. Karen was President of the Association for Computation Linguistics in 1994
during a difficult period, and saw through a transitional phase in which a solid basis
for the long-term health of the association was established.
Karen was an exceptional individual who made very substantial contributions in
two separate fields, computational linguistics (CL) and information retrieval (IR), as
well as in computing and artificial intelligence more broadly. In IR, her greatest contri-
bution was probably her invention (1972) of the concept of inverse document frequency
(IDF), in which the importance of terms is weighted according to the proportion of
documents in the corpus in which they occur; the intuition being that terms which
occur in many documents are poor index terms. This is the partial basis of all weighting
schemes adopted by widely used Internet search engines, and will undoubtedly be a
lasting contribution to the field.
Her primary inspiration and interest was always language, especially language in
practical use. Her long involvement with IR arose (as someone who subsisted for an
inordinately long time on soft money) by the need to find a new line of research in
the aftermath of the ALPAC Report and the subsequent difficulties in getting machine
translation work funded. However, she was always well qualified to work in IR, a topic
addressed in her very early publications (see, for example, Masterman, Needham, and
Sp¨arck Jones 1958), although in a rather different context to her later work.
Given this focus on language it is therefore perhaps odd that her main contributions
to CL or natural language processing are harder to pin down. They include contribu-
tions to summarization, natural language interfaces to structured databases, dialogue,
semantics, and more. In the long term perhaps her greatest contribution will come to be
seen to be her Ph.D. thesis (1964), which was far ahead of its time. It brought together
statistical or machine learning approaches with the use of an existing resource (Roget’s
Thesaurus—punched onto cards!) and still can be read with profit today (see Wilks and
Tait 2005). It can be viewed as the forerunner of a whole range of more recent attempts
to derive semantic information on an empirical basis.
It is perhaps as an empiricist that Karen will be best remembered. Her long associa-
tions with the US TREC initiatives and the more recent DUC summary evaluations are
well known, as is her earlier association with DARPA TIDES, but her desire to work on
well-founded experimental bases runs through from her earliest days, initially through
involvement with Cyril Cleverdon and the Cranfield project, and then later in the work
reported, for example, in Sp¨arck Jones and van Rijsbergen (1976) and Sp¨arck Jones and

Galliers (1996). Perhaps this derived from her being a long associate of Wittgenstein’s
student Margaret Masterman (a connection Karen acknowledged in her acceptance
speech for the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005) and consequently from the
focus of Wittgenstein’s philosophy on language use.
Karen was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England in 1935 of English and Nor-
wegian parents and was very much a child of Second World War Britain. She initially
read History at Cambridge, but graduated in Philosophy (Moral Sciences). Following a
brief spell as a schoolteacher she joined the Cambridge Language Research Unit in 1957
under Masterman and so began a very lengthy period on soft money. The University of
Cambridge finally recognized her standing by awarding her a Readership in 1994 and
a personal chair in 1999.
Karen received very many awards during her career. These include Fellowships of
the American and European Artificial Intelligence societies, Fellowship of the British
Academy, the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award, the Lovelace Medal of the British
Computer Society, the ACM SIGIR Salton Award, the American Society for Information
Science and Technology’s Award of Merit, and the ACM-AAAI Allen Newell Award.
Finally she was awarded the ACM Women’s Group Athena Award, which sadly she
did not live to receive formally, although she bravely recorded an acceptance lecture a
few weeks prior to her death.
Although Karen felt she was never overtly discriminated against as a woman, it
must have taken considerable courage and tenacity to develop a leading academic
career at a time when society’s expectations of women went little beyond their roles
as wives and mothers. She acknowledged the support of her parents and then her late
husband (and long-time academic collaborator) Roger Needham in her obtaining a good
education and developing a career. She noted that in professional circles she was very
frequently the only woman, and made very active efforts, especially in recent years, to
interest young women and girls in careers in computing, believing that “computing was
too important to be left to men.” Karen remained as active as ever after her formal and
undesired retirement (see The Guardian’s Letters Page, 5 October 20021).
These academic achievements should not be allowed to eclipse Karen’s well-
roundedness as a person. She and her late husband Roger were keen sailors, owning,
and maintaining themselves for many years, an 1872 Itchen Ferry Cutter. They also
built their first house with their own hands. Karen could sketch well, made works of art
from everyday objects, and had an enormous knowledge of natural history and church
architecture. She was candid and passionate and could be enormously generous in her
support. She will be greatly missed.
