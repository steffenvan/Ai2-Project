Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963357774193549">
The 2009 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning is the thirteenth in the series of
annual meetings organized by SIGNLL, the ACL special interest group on natural language learning.
CoNLL-2009 will be held in Boulder, CO, 4–5 June 2009, in conjunction with NAACL HLT.
For our special focus this year in the main session of CoNLL, we invited papers on unsupervised,
minimally supervised and semi-supervised methods in natural language learning, as well as on
incremental learning methods. As with earlier CoNLLs, we encouraged papers that addressed these
issues from the perspective both of human language acquisition and of NLP systems.
We received 70 submissions to the main session on these and other relevant topics, of which 11 were
withdrawn. Of the remaining 59 papers, 15 were selected to appear in the conference program as oral
presentations, and 10 were chosen as posters. All accepted papers appear here in the proceedings.
Our invited speakers reflect the state-of-the-art in human and machine learning of natural language, and
we are grateful to Michael Frank and Andrew McCallum for agreeing to speak on their exciting new
work in these areas.
As in previous years, CoNLL-2009 has a shared task, Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies in Multiple
Languages. This is an extension of the CoNLL-2008 shared task to multiple languages (English plus
Catalan, Chinese, Czech, German, Japanese and Spanish). Among the new features are compatible
evaluation for several languages and their comparison, and learning curves for languages with large
datasets. We expect that this major comparative exercise will lead to very enlightening results and
discussion that will serve to move the field forward. The Shared Task papers are collected into an
accompanying volume of CoNLL-2009. We thank Jan Hajic and the rest of the organizers for their
great effort in running the Shared Task.
We would like to thank the members of the SIGNLL steering committee for useful discussion,
especially Lluis M`arquez and Joakim Nivre, who helped us greatly with advice around the conference
organization, and Erik Tjong Kim Sang, who acted as the information officer. We also appreciate the
help we received from NAACL HLT organizers, including Martha Palmer, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson,
Nizar Habash, Christy Doran, Eric Ringger, and Priscilla Rasmussen.
Finally, many thanks to Google for sponsoring the best paper award at CoNLL-2009.
We hope you find CoNLL-2009 a fruitful venue for discussion and interaction on the exciting topics
covered by our program.
