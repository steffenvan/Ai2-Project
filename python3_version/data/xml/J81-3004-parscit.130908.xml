&amp;quot;Pragmalinguistics&amp;quot; or the occupation with prag-
matic aspects of language can be important where
computational linguists or artificial intelligence re-
searchers are concerned with natural language inter-
faces to computers, with modelling dialogue behavior,
or the like. What speakers intend with their utteranc-
es, how hearers react to what they hear, and what they
take the words to mean will all play a role of increas-
ing importance when natural language systems have
matured enough to cope readily with syntax and se-
mantics. Asking a sensible question to a user or giving
him a reasonable response often enough depends not
only on the &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; meaning of some previous utter-
ances but also on attitudes, expectations, and inten-
tions that the user may have. These are partly con-
veyed in the user&apos;s utterances and have to be taken
into account, if a system is to do more than just give
factual answers to factual requests.
Thus someone who wants to construct a natural
language system might look at Mey&apos;s book Pragmalin-
guistics with some expectations as to what he should
consider or what guidelines he should follow, or maybe
just to find out what the current state of the art in
pragmatics is. However, he will find little of that in
this book. Pragmalinguistics is a collection of articles
dealing with many different things—some of the arti-
cles could instead of being called pragmatic or prag-
malinguistic be labelled sociolinguistic. Most authors
that have contributed to this volume are located in
Scandinavia, and thus maybe it gives a good impres-
sion of the concerns of North European linguists.
The article by Bang and Door gives a critique of
the linguistic theories of Lyons, Habermas, Bernstein,
and Ehlich and Rehbein from a Marxist point of view.
The article by Qvortrup criticizes Transformational
Grammar—and in particular the Language Acquisition
Device—again from a Marxist point of view and with
a breath-taking ignorance of what TG is all about.
Lindberg&apos;s article on units of speech is trivial and
Utaker&apos;s on semantics is outdated.
Blakar writes on language as a means of social
power. His paper is anecdotal; he draws conclusions
without stating from what premises; and he is on the
whole not very explicit. Gregersen postulates in his
article on the relationships between social class and
language usage that an economic analysis of &amp;quot;objective
class positions&amp;quot; has to precede sociolinguistic studies
proper, but fails to show how the results of such an
analysis will influence sociolinguistics.
Haeberlin writes on class-specific vocabulary as a
communication problem. His ideas have been pub-
lished before and in more detail. But he at least
makes substantial and concrete claims, and he has a
reasonable framework for his research, even though he
admits that the results he has obtained in his statistical
studies are only preliminary in nature. He found, for
instance, that members of the middle class have a
higher ability to gather the meanings of new words in
conversations than members of the lower class do.
Jacobsen writes on language and emotions much from
the point of view of a psychotherapist. The emphasis
of his article is more on explaining emotions than on
explaining the relationship between language and emo-
tions.
Olsen&apos;s paper is on psychopathology, interaction
and pragmatic linguistics. Sondergaard&apos;s topic is the
neurolinguistic concept of the ontogenesis and disinte-
gration of smooth articulation.
Andersen is concerned with the syntax of texts and
the syntax of actions. He has been influenced by
work done at SRI International, and his analysis of
actions resembles the SRI action graphs. It may be
worthwhile to look at the differences in detail. Bjerg
wites on public speech acts, and Gloy states some
postulates for a theory of linguistic manipulation.
Schank&apos;s article—the only one in the book that
carries the term computational in its title—gives a sum-
mary of Conceptual Dependency Theory because he
feels that is the (only?) prerequisite for computational
pragmatics.
In his closing paper on critical language theory Mey
points out a number of phenomena having to do with
the pragmatics of natural language that should be dealt
with by an integrated linguistic theory.
Pragmalinguistics is a book with an unfortunate
history, which delayed its publication for a long time
—maybe for too long. It is not very useful for some-
one who expects concrete results applicable to the
construction of a natural language system. But it may

Marxist) perspective on linguistic phenomena that
some may not have considered to be linguistic phe-
nomena at all.
