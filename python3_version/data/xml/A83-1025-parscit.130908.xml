Having agreed, with gratitude and delight, to
serve as chairman of the machine-translation
session of this Conference, it became my duty to
comment for the record on the set of four papers
to be presented to us. Thus have events laid on
me an opportunity to review, in a sense, the state
of a field which was my professional home in
earlier and headier days. The task has given me
both enjoyment and knowledge, but few surprises.
More than two decades ago, scholars of the
stature of the late Y. Bar-Hillel were stating in
detail their perceptions of the futility of
automated language translation by the methods then
under development. Some years (and many &amp;quot;progress
reports&amp;quot;) later, others of us came to see that
general translation, without the benefit of a
robust and dominant semantics and pragmatics, was
not thinkable. The very slow and scattered
development of these latter, in both principle and
substance, is the most fundamental impediment to
the computer manipulation of language; in those
tiny domains where the work has been done, the
results are impressive--across a variety of
methods.
Why isn&apos;t more of this work being done, with
more focus? Perhaps both the potential market and
the (mostly military) research sponsors are awed
by the magnitude of the challenge, and skeptical
of the payoffs. One might envision a world in
which, once the skepticism has been answered, such
answers would stimulate rather than intimidate
research.
Meanwhile, we should be busy with other goals
in mind, of which aids-to-translation is an
obvious example.&apos; Two of the papers before us
describe approaches to improving the human
translation process. A third valiantly wades into
the struggle with computational semantics. The
fourth paper offers unsurprising results form an
odd experiment. I should note that all I had
available to me were the abstracts; my comments
below reflect that limitation.
The Slocum paper is more a &amp;quot;statement of
work&amp;quot; for a paper, rather than a substantive
draft. We expect a report on the state of the
Siemens-Texas translation project, and a defense
of its approach in engineering terms. The good
news in this paper is the commercial sponsorship
of the work; the success of such a venture might
stimulate stronger investment in natural-language
projects and studies.
The Melby paper offers an architectural
sketch of an open-ended translator&apos;s system which
could include an MT system as one component. This
modest paper deserves reading for the author&apos;s
perspective on the professional translator.
The paper by Nishida and Doshita describes
the use of Montague-style functional notation to
create a sentence-level semantic interlingua. The
obvious benefits in syntactic simplification are
illustrated. An extended example, in Japanese,
may be crucial for appreciating the scope and
delicacy of the authors work to date.
The paper by Somers discusses a project to do
machine translation on a home computer, which
turns out to be difficult.
