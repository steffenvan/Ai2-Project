Semantique pour l&apos;analyse de la linguistique a l&apos;informatique is a thoughtful and insightful
discussion of difficult issues in the semantic interpretation of natural language texts.
The chapters each focus on one aspect of natural language interpretation, such as
semantic features, morphemes, lexical entries, syntactic processing using a unification
grammar such as tree-adjoining grammar, and semantic relations over larger and larger
units, including the text as a whole and its subparts larger than the sentence.
The book is primarily the work of Francois Rastier, director of research at CNRS,
with the collaboration of Marc Cavazza, who wrote the chapter on the content of
lexical entries, and Anne Abeille, who demonstrates a tree-adjoining grammar (as
proposed by Aravind Joshi and others) and shows how it can be used to represent
syntactic and semantic relations, especially where the syntax—semantics match is not
perfect. The overall goal is to propose an interpretation procedure that combines lex-
ical, morpho-syntactic, and contextual information in a text, what the authors call
Differential Semantics because the process allows for some variation in the outcome,
while remaining basically compositional.
The treatment of syntactically local relations, and some nonlocal relations, on tex-
tual information has much in common with the way that Discourse Representation
Theory integrates linguistic and contextual information within complex sentences and
across sentence boundaries (Kamp and Reyle 1993). Similarly, the goal of integrat-
ing formal linguistic information with contextual information that is proposed here
has a lot in common with the spirit of DRT, though the constraining assumptions
and formalism are, of course, different. For example, the account of aspect in French
given in this book notes how the combination of inherent verbal aspect (Aktionsart)
with morphological aspect (inflectional morphology) may be congruent or not, and if
congruent, may produce another aspectual meaning. For example, a telic verb with
imperfective inflection has iterative aspect (Smith 1991).
The same interpretative process, relating semantic features across constituents and
across sentence boundaries, applies to larger and larger parts of the text. Linguistic
form is integrated with various parts of contextual information, using matches of
features as well as inferences. Interpretation may be restricted or disambiguated by
expectations about different types of discourse and genres of text. The interpretation
of even lexical and morpho-syntactic information is therefore relative to the text, a
notion borrowed from the hermeneutic tradition of philology and European philoso-
phy. The authors have taken seriously the idea that linguistic form under-determines
the interpretation of a sentence or text containing it but nevertheless contributes to its
meaning in a regular though not fully predictable way.

Grammar and of the syntax–semantics correspondence, abstract away from properties
of discourse and text. Theories of comprehension seem to abstract away from linguistic
form. Neither approach in itself directly addresses problems of text interpretation. The
authors have set out to use both contextual and formal information in their interpre-
tive procedure. They collectively have an impressive knowledge of formal linguistics
and experience in application of linguistics to problems of Al. Their account of in-
terpretation applied to larger and larger stretches of text is quite insightful, though
their treatment of the problem of texts as a whole seems still quite programmatic,
as they are the first to admit. The discussion of current and formerly popular ideas
carries a great deal of credibility, and their proposal allows for considerable variation
and subtlety in the results, which have implications for the machine–natural language
interface, expert systems, and computer modeling of cognitive abilities.
The book is written in a very clear style, but inevitably the abstract nature of the
subject matter and the need for technical terms means that one must have a fairly
secure grasp of French to read it. There is a useful glossary of the terms that are par-
ticular to Rastier&apos;s Differential Semantics, such as isosemie (the linking of information
by the functional system of the language, such as agreement and case–object selec-
tion). The references to works listed in the bibliography also help to situate some of
the more abstract ideas in specific sources, both in French and English.
Unlike most collections of papers on semantics and lexical knowledge by different
authors, this volume has a great degree of cohesion. The development of the central
idea of the construction of meaning from various sources and interpretative processes
becomes clearer and clearer as more chapters are read (not necessarily in the order in
which they are found in the book—I found it easier to start with the subject matter
with which I was most familiar, such as unification grammars and issues of lexical
representation).
In addition to its intended purpose of defining fruitful approaches to text interpre-
tation, this book gives French-speaking computer scientists and linguists a useful guide
to research that is mainly done in Britain and North America. For English-speaking
researchers, it is also a valuable resource and guide to research done in France on
semantics, syntax, and computer processing of natural language. For example, Rastier
et al. refer to Pustejovsky (1993), a collection of papers on lexical knowledge and arti-
ficial intelligence that has many of the same preoccupations as Rastier et al.; but none
of the authors in Pustejovsky&apos;s volume refer to any work not written in English. Both
volumes do, however, draw from much the same body of research.
Whether one agrees that Differential Semantics is the direction to pursue, or dis-
agrees, or is merely agnostic, this book represents an informed, critical discussion of is-
sues in the understanding of natural language texts, using the resources of computers.
