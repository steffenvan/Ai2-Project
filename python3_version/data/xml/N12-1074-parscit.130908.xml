<bodyText confidence="0.999766555555555">
Microblogging networks serve as vehicles for
reaching and influencing users. Predicting
whether a message will elicit a user response
opens the possibility of maximizing the viral-
ity, reach and effectiveness of messages and
ad campaigns on these networks. We propose
a discriminative model for predicting the like-
lihood of a response or a retweet on the Twit-
ter network. The approach uses features de-
rived from various sources, such as the lan-
guage used in the tweet, the user’s social net-
work and history. The feature design process
leverages aggregate statistics over the entire
social network to balance sparsity and infor-
mativeness. We use real-world tweets to train
models and empirically show that they are ca-
pable of generating accurate predictions for a
large number of tweets.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980902125">
Microblogging networks are increasingly evolving
into broadcasting networks with strong social as-
pects. The most popular network today, Twitter, re-
ported routing 200 million tweets (status posts) per
day in mid-2011. As the network is increasingly
used as a channel for reaching out and marketing
to its users, content generators aim to maximize the
impact of their messages, an inherently challeng-
ing task. However, unlike for conventionally pro-
duced news, Twitter’s public network allows one to
observe how messages are reaching and influencing
users. One such direct measure of impact are mes-
sage responses.
* This work was conducted at Microsoft Research.
In this work, we describe methods to predict if a
given tweet will elicit a response. Twitter provides
two methods to respond to messages: replies and
retweets (re-posting of a message to one’s follow-
ers). Responses thus serve both as a measure of dis-
tribution and as a way to increase it. Being able to
predict responses is valuable for any content gener-
ator, including advertisers and celebrities, who use
Twitter to increase their exposure and maintain their
brand. Furthermore, this prediction ability can be
used for ranking, allowing the creation of better op-
timized news feeds.
To predict if a tweet will receive a response prior
to its posting we use features of the individual tweet
together with features aggregated over the entire so-
cial network. These features, in combination with
historical activity, are used to train a prediction
model.

The public nature of Twitter and the unique char-
acteristics of its content have made it an attractive
research topic over recent years. Related work can
be divided into several types:
Twitter Demographics One of the most fertile av-
enues of research is modeling users and their inter-
actions on Twitter. An extensive line of work char-
acterizes users (Pear Analytics, 2009) and quantifies
user influence (Cha et al., 2010; Romero et al., 2011;
Wu et al., 2011; Bakshy et al., 2011). Popescu and
Jain (2011) explored how businesses use Twitter to
connect with their customer base. Popescu and Pen-
nacchiotti (2011) and Qu et al. (2011) investigated

how users react to events on social media. There
also has been extensive work on modeling conver-
sational interactions on Twitter (Honeycutt and Her-
ring, 2009; Boyd et al., 2010; Ritter et al., 2010;
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011). Our work
builds on these findings to predict response behavior
on a large scale.
Mining Twitter Social media has been used to de-
tect events (Sakaki et al., 2010; Popescu and Pennac-
chiotti, 2010; Popescu et al., 2011), and even predict
their outcomes (Asur and Huberman, 2010; Culotta,
2010). Similarly to this line of work, we mine the
social network for event prediction. In contrast, our
focus is on predicting events within the network.
Response Prediction There has been significant
work addressing the task of response prediction in
news articles (Tsagkias et al., 2009; Tsagkias et al.,
2010) and blogs (Yano et al., 2009; Yano and Smith,
2010; Balasubramanyan et al., 2011). The task of
predicting responses in social networks has been in-
vestigated previously: Hong et al. (2011) focused
on predicting responses for highly popular items,
Rowe et al. (2011) targeted the prediction of con-
versations and their length and Suh et al. (2010) pre-
dicted retweets. In contrast, our work targets tweets
regardless of their popularity and attempts to predict
both replies and retweets. Furthermore, we present
a scalable method to use linguistic lexical features in
discriminative models by leveraging global network
statistics. A related task to ours is that of response
generation, as explored by Ritter et al. (2011). Our
work complements their approach by allowing to
detect when the generation of a response is appro-
priate. Lastly, the task of predicting the spread of
hashtags in microblogging networks (Tsur and Rap-
poport, 2012) is also closely related to our work and
both approaches supplement each other as measures
of impact.
Ranking in News Feeds Different approaches
were suggested for ranking items in social media
(Das Sarma et al., 2010; Lakkaraju et al., 2011). Our
work provides an important signal, which can be in-
corporated into any ranking approach.

3 Response Prediction on Twitter
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999914">
Our goal is to learn a function f that maps a tweet
x to a binary value y C {0,1}, where y indicates if
x will receive a response. In this work we make no
distinction between different kinds of responses.
In addition to x, we assume access to a social net-
work S, which we view as a directed graph (U, E).
The set of vertices U represents the set of users. For
each u&apos;, u&apos;&apos; C U, (u&apos;, u&apos;&apos;) C E if and only if there
exists a following relationship from u&apos; to u&apos;&apos;.
For the purpose of defining features we denote xt
as the text of the tweet x and xu C U the user who
posted x. For training we assume access to a set of
n labeled examples {(xi, yi) : i = 1... n}, where
the label indicates whether the tweet has received a
response or not.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.972691">
3.1 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987147214285714">
For prediction we represent a given tweet x using six
feature families:
Historical Features Historical behavior is often
strong evidence of future trends. To account for this
information, we compute the following features: ra-
tio of tweets by xu that received a reply, ratio of
tweets by xu that were retweeted and ratio of tweets
by xu that received both a reply and retweet.
Social Features The immediate audience of a user
xu is his followers. Therefore, incorporating social
features into our model is likely to contribute to its
prediction ability. For a user xu C U we include
features for the number of followers (indegree in S),
the number of users xu follows (outdegree in S) and
the ratio between the two.
Aggregate Lexical Features To detect lexical
items that trigger certain response behavior we de-
fine features for all bigrams and hashtags in our set
of tweets. To avoid sparsity and maintain a manage-
able feature space we compress the features using
the labels: for each lexical item l we define Rl to
be the set of tweets that include l and received a re-
sponse, and Nl to be the set of tweets that contain l
and received no response. We then define the inte-
ger n to be the rounding of �Rl�
�Nl� to the nearest integer.
For each such integer we define a feature, which we
increase by 1 when the lexical item l is present in xt.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996765">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999662789473684">
We use this process separately for bigrams and hash-
tags, creating separate sets of aggregate features.
Local Content Features We introduce 45 features
to capture how the content of xt influences response
behavior, including features such as the number of
stop words and the percentage of English words. In
addition we include features specific to Twitter, such
as the number of hash tags and user references.
Posting Features Past analysis of Twitter showed
that posting time influences response potential (Pear
Analytics, 2009). To examine temporal influences,
we include features to account for the user’s local
time and day of the week when x was created.
Sentiment Features To measure how sentiment
influences response behavior we define features that
count the number of positive and negative sentiment
words in xt. To detect sentiment words we use a pro-
prietary Microsoft lexicon of 7K positive and nega-
tive terms.

<bodyText confidence="0.9976915">
We experimented with two different learning al-
gorithms: Multiple Additive Regression-Trees
(MART) (Wu et al., 2008) and a maximum entropy
classifier (Berger et al., 1996). Both provide fast
classification, a natural requirement for large-scale
real-time tasks.

<bodyText confidence="0.999017875">
In our evaluation we focus on English tweets only.
Since we use local posting time in our features, we
filtered users whose profile did not contain location
information. To collect Tweeter messages we used
the entire public feed of Twitter (often referred to as
the Twitter Firehose). We randomly sampled 943K
tweets from one week of data. We allowed an ex-
tra week for responses, giving a response window
of two weeks. The majority of tweets in our set
(90%) received no response. We used 750K tweets
for training and 188K for evaluation. A separate data
set served as a development set. For the computation
of aggregate lexical features we used 186M tweets
from the same week, resulting in 14M bigrams and
400K hash tags. To compute historical features, we
sampled 2B tweets from the previous three months.

4.3 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985652173913">
Our evaluation focuses on precision-recall curves
for predicting that a given tweet will get a response.
The curves were generated by varying the confi-
dence measure threshold, which both classifiers pro-
vided. As can be seen in Figure 1, MART outper-
forms the maximum entropy model. We can also see
that it is hard to predict response behavior for most
tweets, but for a large subset we can provide a rela-
tively accurate prediction (highlighted in Figure 1).
The rest of our analysis focuses on this subset and
on results based on MART.
To better understand the contribution of each fea-
ture set, we removed features in a greedy manner.
After learning a model and testing it, we removed
the feature family that was overall most highly
ranked by MART (i.e., was used in high-level splits
in the decision trees) and learned a new model. Fig-
ure 2 shows how removing feature sets degrades pre-
diction performance. Removing historical features
lowers the model’s prediction abilities, although pre-
diction quality remains relatively high. Removing
social features creates a bigger drop in performance.
Lastly, removing aggregate lexical features and lo-

cal content features further decreases performance.
At this point, removing posting time features is not
influential. Following the removal of posting time
features, the model includes only sentiment features.

5 Discussion and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999713958333333">
The first trend seen by removing features is that local
content matters less, or at least is more complex to
capture and use for response prediction. Despite the
influence of chronological trends on posting behav-
ior on Twitter (Pear Analytics, 2009), we were un-
able to show influence of posting time on response
prediction. Historical features were the most promi-
nent in our experiments. Second were social fea-
tures, showing that developing one’s network is crit-
ical for impact. The third most prominent set of fea-
tures, aggregate lexical features, shows that users are
sensitive to certain expressions and terms that tend
to trigger responses.
The natural path for future work is to improve per-
formance using new features. These may include
clique-specific language features, more properties of
the user’s social network, mentions of named enti-
ties and topics of tweets. Another direction is to dis-
tinguish between replies and retweets and to predict
the number of responses and the length of conversa-
tions that a tweet may generate. There is also po-
tential in learning models for the prediction of other
measures of impact, such as hashtag adoption and
inclusion in “favorites” lists.

Response Prediction There has been significant work addressing the task of response prediction in news articles (Tsagkias et al., 2009; Tsagkias et al., 2010) and blogs (Yano et al., 2009; Yano and Smith, 2010; Balasubramanyan et al., 2011). The task of predicting responses in social networks has been investigated previously: Hong et al. (2011) focused on predicting responses for highly popular items, Rowe et al. (2011) targeted the prediction of conversations and their length and Suh et al. (2010) predicted retweets. In contrast, our work targets tweets regardless of their popularity and attempts to predict both replies and retweets.

To examine temporal influences, we include features to account for the user’s local time and day of the week when x was created. Sentiment Features To measure how sentiment influences response behavior we define features that count the number of positive and negative sentiment words in xt. To detect sentiment words we use a proprietary Microsoft lexicon of 7K positive and negative terms. 4 Evaluation 4.1 Learning Algorithm We experimented with two different learning algorithms: Multiple Additive Regression-Trees (MART) (Wu et al., 2008) and a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996). Both provide fast classification, a natural requirement for large-scale real-time tasks. 4.2 Dataset In our evaluation we focus on English tweets only. Since we use local posting time in our features, we filtered users whose profile did not contain location information. To collect Tweeter messages we used the entire public feed of Twitter (often referred to as the Twitter Firehose). We randomly sampled 943K tweets from one week of data. We allowed an extra week for responses, giving a response window of two weeks. The majority of tweets in our set (90%) received no response. We used 750K twe</context>

In addition we include features specific to Twitter, such as the number of hash tags and user references.

Lastly, removing aggregate lexical features and lo604 cal content features further decreases performance. At this point, removing posting time features is not influential. Following the removal of posting time features, the model includes only sentiment features. 5 Discussion and Conclusion The first trend seen by removing features is that local content matters less, or at least is more complex to capture and use for response prediction. Despite the influence of chronological trends on posting behavior on Twitter (Pear Analytics, 2009), we were unable to show influence of posting time on response prediction. Historical features were the most prominent in our experiments. Second were social features, showing that developing one’s network is critical for impact. The third most prominent set of features, aggregate lexical features, shows that users are sensitive to certain expressions and terms that tend to trigger responses. The natural path for future work is to improve performance using new features. These may include clique-specific language features, more properties of the user’s social network, mentions of named entities</context>

To examine temporal influences, we include features to account for the user’s local time and day of the week when x was created. Sentiment Features To measure how sentiment influences response behavior we define features that count the number of positive and negative sentiment words in xt. To detect sentiment words we use a proprietary Microsoft lexicon of 7K positive and negative terms. 4 Evaluation 4.1 Learning Algorithm We experimented with two different learning algorithms: Multiple Additive Regression-Trees (MART) (Wu et al., 2008) and a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996). Both provide fast classification, a natural requirement for large-scale real-time tasks. 4.2 Dataset In our evaluation we focus on English tweets only. Since we use local posting time in our features, we filtered users whose profile did not contain location information. To collect Tweeter messages we used the entire public feed of Twitter (often referred to as the Twitter Firehose). We randomly sampled 943K tweets from one week of data. We allowed an extra week for responses, giving a response window of two weeks. The majority of tweets </context>
