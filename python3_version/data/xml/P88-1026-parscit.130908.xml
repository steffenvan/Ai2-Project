<bodyText confidence="0.999932214285714">
The paper describes the development of software for
automatic grammatical analysis of unrestricted, unedited
English text at the Unit for Computer Research on the English
Language (UCREL) at the University of Lancaster. The work
is currently funded by IBM and carried out in collaboration
with colleagues at IBM UK (Winchester) and IBM Yorktown
Heights. The paper will focus on the lexicon component of the
word tagging system. the UCREL grammar, the databanks of
parsed sentences, and the tools that have been written to
support development of these components. This work has
applications to speech technology, spelling correction. and
other areas of natural language processing. Currently, our goal
is to provide a language model using transition statistics to
disambiguate alternative parses for a speech recognition device.

1. Text Corpora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999809375">
Historically, the use of text corpora to provide empirical
data for testing grammatical theories has been regarded as
important to varying degrees by philologists and linguists of
differing persuasions. The use of corpus citations in grammars
and dictionaries pm-dates electronic data processing (Brown,
1984: 34). While most of the generative grammarians of the
60s and 70s ignored campus data, the increased power of the
new technology nevertheless points the way to new
applications of computerized text corpora in dictionary making,
style checking and speech recognition. Computer corpora
present the computational linguist with the diversity and
complexity of real language which is more challenging for
testing language models than intuitively derived examples.
Ultimately grammars must be judged by their ability to
contend with the real facts of language and not just basic
constructs extrapolated by grammarians.

2. Word Tagging
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999741272727273">
The system devised for automatic word tagging or part of
speech selection for processing running English text, known as
the Constituent-Likelihood Automatic Word-tagging System
(CLAWS) (Garside et aL, 1987) serves as the basis for the
current woric. The word tagging system is an automated
component of the probabilistic parsing system we are currently
working on. In word tagging, each of the nmning words in the
corpus text to be processed is associated with a pie-terminal
symbol, denoting word class. In essence. the CLAWS suite can
be conceptually divided into two phases: tag assignment and
tag selection.

Exceptions are dealt with by invoking a look up procedure that
searches through a limited list of groups of two or more
words, or by automatically adjusting the probabilities of
sequences of three tags in cases when the intermediate tag is
misleading.
The current version of the CLAWS system requires no pre-
editing and attributes the correct word tag to over 96 per cern
of the input miming words, leaving 3 to 4 per cern to be
corrected by human post-editors.

3. Error Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999680285714286">
Error analysis of CLAWS output has resulted, and
condnues to result, in diverse improvements to the system,
from the simple adjustment of probability weightings against
tags in the lexicon to the inclusion of additional procedures,
for instance to deal with the distinction between proper names
and common nouns.
Parts of the system can also be used to develop new parts.
to extend existing pans, or to interface with other systems. For
instance, in order to produce a lexicon sufficiently large and
detailed enough for parsing, we needed to extend the original
list of about 8,000 entries to over 20.000 (the new CLAWS
lexicon contains about 26,500 entries).&apos; In order to do this, a
list of 15,000 words not already in the CLAWS lexicon was
tagged using the CLAWS tag assignment program. (Since they
were not already in the lexicon, the candidate tags for each
new entry were assigned by suffudist lookup or default tag
assignment.) The new list was then post-edited by interactive
screen editing and merged with the old lexicon.
Another example of &apos;self improvement&apos; is in the production
of a better set of one-step transition probabilities. The first
CLAWS system used a matrix of tag transition probabilities
derived from the tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kaera,
1982). Some cells of this matrix were inaccurate because of
incompatibility of the Brown tagset and the CLAWS tagset. To
remedy this, a new matrix was created by a statistics-gathering
program that processed the post-edited version of a corpus of
one million words tagged by the original CLAWS suite of
programs.

4. Subcategorization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.943647826086956">
Apart from extending the vocabulary coverage of the
CLAWS lexicon, we are also subcategorizing words belonging
to the major word classes in order to reduce the over-
generation of alternative panes of sentences of greater than
trivial length. The task of subcategolization involves:
(1) a linguist&apos;s specification of a schema or typology of
lexical subcategories based on distributional and
Tag assignment involves, for each input running word or
punctuation mark, lexicon look-up, which provides one or
more potential word tags for each input word or punctuation
mark. The lexicon is a list of about 8.000 records containing
fields for
(1) the word form
(2) the set of one or more candidate tags denoting the word&apos;s
word class(es) with probability markers attached
indicating three different levels of probability.
Words not in the CLAWS lexicon are assigned potential
tags either by suffixlist look-up, which attempts to match end
characters of the input word with a suffix in the suffudist, or.
if the input word does not have a word-ending to match one of
these entries, default tags are assigned. The procedures ensure
that rare words and neologisms not in the lexicon are still
given an analysis.

Tag selection disambiguates the alternative tags that are
assigned to some of the running words. Disambiguation is
achieved by invoking one-step probabilities of tag pair
likelihoods extracted from a previously tagged training corpus
and upgrading or downgrading likelihoods according to the
probability markers against word tags in the lexicon or
suffixlist. In the majority of cases, this first order Markov
model is sufficient to correctly select the most likely sequence
of tags associated with the input running text. (Over 90 per

the subcategory codes in the linguist&apos;s schema to the
major lexical word forms (verbs, nouns, adjectives).
The amount of detail demarcated by the subcategorization
typology is dependent. in part, on the practical requirements of
the system. Existing subcategorization systems, such as the one
provided in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English
(1978) or Sager&apos;s (1981) subcategories, need to be taken into
account. But these are assessed critically rather than adopted
wholesale (see for instance Akkaman et al.. 1985 and
Boguraev et at.. 1987, for a discussion of the strengths and
weaknesses of the LDOCE grammar codes).

Figure 3: The initial schema of eleven verb subcategories
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887076923077">
We began subcategorization of the CLAWS lexicon by
word-tagging the 3,000 most frequent words in the Brown
corpus (Kutera and Francis, 1967). An initial system of eleven
verb subcategories was proposed, and judgements about which
subcategory(ies) each verb belonged to were empirically tested
by looking up entries in the microfiche concordance of the
tagged Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen corpus (Holland and Johansson.
1982; Johansson et al. 1986) which shows every occurrence of
a tagged word in the corpus together with its context.
About 2,500 verbs have been coded in this way, and we are
now working on a more detailed system of about 80 different
verb subcategories using the Lexicon Development
Environment of Boguraev et al. (1987).

6. Grammar Development and Parsed
Subcorpora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947454545455">
The databank of approximately 45,000 words of manually
parsed sentences of the Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen corpus
(Sampson, 1987: 83ff). was processed to .show the distinct
types of production rules and their frequency of occurrence in
the grammar associated with the Sampson neebank. Experience
of the UCREL probabilistic system (Garside and Leech. 1987:
66ff) and suggestions from other researchers prompting new
rules resulted in a new context-free grammar of about 6,000
productions creating more steeply nested structures than those
of the Sampson grammar. (It was anticipated that steeper
nesting would reduce the size of the treebank required to
obtain adequate frequency statistics.) The new grammar is
defined descriptively in a Parser&apos;s Manual (Leech, 1987) and
formalised as a set of context-free phrase-structure productions.
Development of the grammar then proceeded in tandem
with the construction of a second databank of parsed sentences,
fitting, as closely as possible, the rules expressed by the
grammar. The new databank comprises extracts from
newspaper reports daring from 1979-80 in the Associated Press
(AP) corpus. Any difficulties the grammarians had in parsing
were resolved, where appropriate, by amending or adding rules
to the grammar. This methodology resulted in the grammar

7. Constructing the Parsed Databank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975475">
For convenience of screen editing and computer processing,
the constituent structures are represented in a linear form, as
strings of grammatical words with labelled bracketing. The
grammarians are given print-outs of post-edited output from
the CLAWS suite. They then construct a constituent analysis
for each sentence on the print-out, either in detail or in outline,
according to the rules described in the Parser&apos;s Manual, and
key in their structures using an input program that checks for
well-formedress. The well-formedness constraints imposed by
the program are:

<listItem confidence="0.9965555">
(1) that labels are legal non-terminal symbols
(2) that labelled brackets balance
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.892237444444444">
(3) that the productions obtained by the input analysis are
contained in the existing grammar.
One sentence is presented at a time. Any errors found by
the program are reported back to the screen, once the
grammarian has sent what s/he considers to be the completed
parse. Sentences which are not well formed can be re-edited or
abandoned. A validity marker is appended to the reference for
each sentence indicating whether the sentence has been
abandoned with errors contained in it.

8. Assessing the Parsed Databank and the
Grammar
We have written ancillary programs, to help in the
development of the grammar and to check the validity of the
parses in the databank. One program searches through the
parsed databank for every occurrence of a constituent matching
a specified constituent tag. Output is a list of all occurrences of
the specified constituent together with frequencies. This facility
allows selective searching through the databank, which is a
useful tool for revising parts of the grammar.

9. Skeleton Parsing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999048375">
We are aiming to produce a million word corpus of parsed
sentences by December 1988 so that we can implement a
variant of the CYK algorithm (Hopcmft and Ullman. 1979:
140) to obtain a set of parses for each sentence. Viterbi
labelling (Bahl et al. 1983; Fomey, 1973) could be used to
select the most probable pane from the output parse set. But
problems associated with assembling a fully parsed databank
are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8967075">
(1) speed of production and
(2) matching the parsed databank to an evolving grammar.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966142857143">
In order to circumvent these problems, a strategy of
skeleton parsing has been introduced. In skeleton parsing,
grammarians enter minimal labelled bracketing by insetting
only those labelled brackets that are uncontroversial and, in
sonic cases, by inserting brackets with no labels. The grammar
validation routine is de-coupled from the input program so that
changes to the grammar can be made without disrupting the
input parsing. The strategy also prevents extensive
retrospective editing whenever the grammar is modified.
Grammar development and parsed databank consauction are
not entirely independent however. A subset (10 per cent) of the
skeleton pluses are extracted for comparison with the current
grammar, while another subset (1 per cent) is checked by
independan grammarians.
Skeleton parsing will give us a partially parsed databank
which should limit the alternative parses compatible with the
final grammar. We can either assume each parse is equally
likely and use the frequency weighted productions generated
by the partially parsed databank to upgrade or downgrade
alternative parses or we can use a &apos;restrained&apos; outside/inside
algorithm (Baker. 1979) to find the optimal parse.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999305">
The development of the CLAWS tagset and UCREL
grammar owes much to the work of Quirk a al. (1985) while
the tags themselves have evolved from the Brown tagset
(Francis and Kutera. 1982). However, the rules and symbols
chosen have been translated into a notation compatible with
other theories of grammar. For instance, tags from the
extended version of the CLAWS lexicon have been translated
into a formalism compatible with the Winchester parser
(Sharman. 1988). A program has also been written to map all
of the ten thousand productions of the current UCREL
grammar into the notation used by the Grammar Development
Environment (ODE) (Briscoe et al., 1987; Grover et aL, 1988;
Carroll et al.. 1988). This is a preliminary step in the task of
recasting the grammar into a feature-based unification
formalism which will allow us to radically reduce the size of
the rule set while preventing the grammar from overgenerating.

<abstract confidence="0.979361191358025">The paper describes the development of software for automatic grammatical analysis of unrestricted, unedited English text at the Unit for Computer Research on the English Language (UCREL) at the University of Lancaster. The work is currently funded by IBM and carried out in collaboration with colleagues at IBM UK (Winchester) and IBM Yorktown Heights. The paper will focus on the lexicon component of the word tagging system. the UCREL grammar, the databanks of parsed sentences, and the tools that have been written to support development of these components. This work has applications to speech technology, spelling correction. and other areas of natural language processing. Currently, our goal is to provide a language model using transition statistics to disambiguate alternative parses for a speech recognition device. 1. Text Corpora Historically, the use of text corpora to provide empirical data for testing grammatical theories has been regarded as important to varying degrees by philologists and linguists of differing persuasions. The use of corpus citations in grammars and dictionaries pm-dates electronic data processing (Brown, 1984: 34). While most of the generative grammarians of the 60s and 70s ignored campus data, the increased power of the new technology nevertheless points the way to new applications of computerized text corpora in dictionary making, style checking and speech recognition. Computer corpora present the computational linguist with the diversity and complexity of real language which is more challenging for testing language models than intuitively derived examples. Ultimately grammars must be judged by their ability to contend with the real facts of language and not just basic constructs extrapolated by grammarians. 2. Word Tagging The system devised for automatic word tagging or part of speech selection for processing running English text, known as the Constituent-Likelihood Automatic Word-tagging System (CLAWS) (Garside et aL, 1987) serves as the basis for the current woric. The word tagging system is an automated component of the probabilistic parsing system we are currently working on. In word tagging, each of the nmning words in the corpus text to be processed is associated with a pie-terminal denoting word class. In essence. the CLAWS suite be conceptually divided into two phases: tag assignment and tag selection. NNS1: NP1: NN1@ VVO wig NN1% NNS1: VV0e VVN J1:1@ NN1 VVO@ 1: of the CLAWS Lexicon JB = attributive adjective; JJ = general adjective; NN1 = singular.common noun; NNS1 = noun of style or title; NPI = singular proper noun; VVO = base form of lexical verb; VVD past tense of lexical verb; VVG = of lexical verb; VVN = past participle of lexical verb; %, @ = probability markers; = word initial capital marker. 211 cent of running words are correctly disambiguated in this way.) Exceptions are dealt with by invoking a look up procedure that searches through a limited list of groups of two or more words, or by automatically adjusting the probabilities of sequences of three tags in cases when the intermediate tag is misleading. The current version of the CLAWS system requires no preediting and attributes the correct word tag to over 96 per cern of the input miming words, leaving 3 to 4 per cern to be corrected by human post-editors. 3. Error Analysis Error analysis of CLAWS output has resulted, and condnues to result, in diverse improvements to the system, from the simple adjustment of probability weightings against tags in the lexicon to the inclusion of additional procedures, for instance to deal with the distinction between proper names and common nouns. Parts of the system can also be used to develop new parts. to extend existing pans, or to interface with other systems. For instance, in order to produce a lexicon sufficiently large and detailed enough for parsing, we needed to extend the original list of about 8,000 entries to over 20.000 (the new CLAWS lexicon contains about 26,500 entries).&apos; In order to do this, a list of 15,000 words not already in the CLAWS lexicon was tagged using the CLAWS tag assignment program. (Since they were not already in the lexicon, the candidate tags for each new entry were assigned by suffudist lookup or default tag assignment.) The new list was then post-edited by interactive screen editing and merged with the old lexicon. Another example of &apos;self improvement&apos; is in the production of a better set of one-step transition probabilities. The first CLAWS system used a matrix of tag transition probabilities derived from the tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kaera, 1982). Some cells of this matrix were inaccurate because of incompatibility of the Brown tagset and the CLAWS tagset. To remedy this, a new matrix was created by a statistics-gathering program that processed the post-edited version of a corpus of one million words tagged by the original CLAWS suite of programs. 4. Subcategorization Apart from extending the vocabulary coverage of the CLAWS lexicon, we are also subcategorizing words belonging to the major word classes in order to reduce the overgeneration of alternative panes of sentences of greater than trivial length. The task of subcategolization involves: (1) a linguist&apos;s specification of a schema or typology of lexical subcategories based on distributional and Tag assignment involves, for each input running word or punctuation mark, lexicon look-up, which provides one or more potential word tags for each input word or punctuation mark. The lexicon is a list of about 8.000 records containing fields for (1) the word form (2) the set of one or more candidate tags denoting the word&apos;s word class(es) with probability markers attached indicating three different levels of probability. Words not in the CLAWS lexicon are assigned potential tags either by suffixlist look-up, which attempts to match end characters of the input word with a suffix in the suffudist, or. if the input word does not have a word-ending to match one of these entries, default tags are assigned. The procedures ensure rare words and neologisms not in the lexicon are given an analysis. NP1: VVO NP1: VVO NP1: 2: of the Suffudist Tag selection disambiguates the alternative tags that are assigned to some of the running words. Disambiguation is achieved by invoking one-step probabilities of tag pair likelihoods extracted from a previously tagged training corpus and upgrading or downgrading likelihoods according to the probability markers against word tags in the lexicon or In the majority of cases, order Markov model is sufficient to correctly select the most likely sequence of tags associated with the input running text. (Over 90 per 212 3 functional criteria. (2) a lexicographer&apos;s judgement in assigning one or more of the subcategory codes in the linguist&apos;s schema to the major lexical word forms (verbs, nouns, adjectives). The amount of detail demarcated by the subcategorization typology is dependent. in part, on the practical requirements of the system. Existing subcategorization systems, such as the one provided in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (1978) or Sager&apos;s (1981) subcategories, need to be taken into account. But these are assessed critically rather than adopted wholesale (see for instance Akkaman et al.. 1985 and Boguraev et at.. 1987, for a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the LDOCE grammar codes). [1] intransirive verb : ache, age, allow, care, conflict, escape. fish, occur, reply, snow, stay, sun-bathe, swoon, talk, vanish.

[A] verb habitually followed by an adverbial : appear, come, go, keep, lie, live, move, put, sit, stand, swim, veer. [W] verb followed by a wit-clause : ask, choose, doubt. imagine, know, matter, mind, wonder. 3: initial schema of eleven verb subcategories We began subcategorization of the CLAWS lexicon by word-tagging the 3,000 most frequent words in the Brown corpus (Kutera and Francis, 1967). An initial system of eleven verb subcategories was proposed, and judgements about which subcategory(ies) each verb belonged to were empirically tested by looking up entries in the microfiche concordance of the tagged Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen corpus (Holland and Johansson. 1982; Johansson et al. 1986) which shows every occurrence of a tagged word in the corpus together with its context. About 2,500 verbs have been coded in this way, and we are now working on a more detailed system of about 80 different verb subcategories using the Lexicon Development Environment of Boguraev et al. (1987). 5. Constituent Analysis The task of implementing a probabilistic parsing algorithm to provide a disambiguated constituent analysis of unrestricted English is more demanding than implementing the word tagging suite, not least because, in order to operate in a manner similar to the word-tagging model, the system requires (1) specification of an appropriate grammar of rules and symbols and (2) the construction of a sufficiently large databank of parsed sentences conforming to the (optimal) grammar specified in (1) to provide statistics of&apos; the relative likelihoods of constituent tag transitions for constituent tag disambiguation. In order to meet these prior requirements, researchers have been employed on a full-time basis to assemble a corpus of parsed sentences. 6. Grammar Development and Parsed Subcorpora The databank of approximately 45,000 words of manually parsed sentences of the Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen corpus 1987: was processed to .show the distinct types of production rules and their frequency of occurrence in the grammar associated with the Sampson neebank. Experience of the UCREL probabilistic system (Garside and Leech. 1987: 66ff) and suggestions from other researchers prompting new rules resulted in a new context-free grammar of about 6,000 productions creating more steeply nested structures than those of the Sampson grammar. (It was anticipated that steeper nesting would reduce the size of the treebank required to obtain adequate frequency statistics.) The new grammar is defined descriptively in a Parser&apos;s Manual (Leech, 1987) and formalised as a set of context-free phrase-structure productions. Development of the grammar then proceeded in tandem with the construction of a second databank of parsed sentences, fitting, as closely as possible, the rules expressed by the grammar. The new databank comprises extracts from newspaper reports daring from 1979-80 in the Associated Press (AP) corpus. Any difficulties the grammarians had in parsing were resolved, where appropriate, by amending or adding rules to the grammar. This methodology resulted in the grammar 213 being modified and extended to nearly 10,000 context-free productions by December 1987. Od (I) (V) Oh (I) (Vn) Ob (I) (Vg) / (vn) } Fragment of the Grammar front the Parser&apos;s Manual = operator consisting of. or ending with, a form of operator consisting of, or ending with, a form of = operator constisting of, or ending with, a form of the verb = main verb with complementation; = predicate; = an phrase; Vn es a past participle phrase; 0= constituents; (/) 13alternative constituents. 7. Constructing the Parsed Databank For convenience of screen editing and computer processing, the constituent structures are represented in a linear form, as strings of grammatical words with labelled bracketing. The grammarians are given print-outs of post-edited output from the CLAWS suite. They then construct a constituent analysis for each sentence on the print-out, either in detail or in outline, according to the rules described in the Parser&apos;s Manual, and key in their structures using an input program that checks for well-formedress. The well-formedness constraints imposed by the program are: (1) that labels are legal non-terminal symbols (2) that labelled brackets balance (3) that the productions obtained by the input analysis are contained in the existing grammar. One sentence is presented at a time. Any errors found by the program are reported back to the screen, once the grammarian has sent what s/he considers to be the completed parse. Sentences which are not well formed can be re-edited or abandoned. A validity marker is appended to the reference for each sentence indicating whether the sentence has been abandoned with errors contained in it.

NN2 = plural common noun; NNL2 = plural locative noun; NNT1 = temporal noun; NNU = unit of measurement RR = adverb; VBR = = genitive marker. 8. Assessing the Parsed Databank and the Grammar We have written ancillary programs, to help in the development of the grammar and to check the validity of the parses in the databank. One program searches through the parsed databank for every occurrence of a constituent matching a specified constituent tag. Output is a list of all occurrences of the specified constituent together with frequencies. This facility allows selective searching through the databank, which is a useful tool for revising parts of the grammar. 9. Skeleton Parsing aiming to produce a million word corpus of parsed sentences by December 1988 so that we can implement a variant of the CYK algorithm (Hopcmft and Ullman. 1979: 140) to obtain a set of parses for each sentence. Viterbi labelling (Bahl et al. 1983; Fomey, 1973) could be used to select the most probable pane from the output parse set. But problems associated with assembling a fully parsed databank are: (1) speed of production and (2) matching the parsed databank to an evolving grammar. In order to circumvent these problems, a strategy of skeleton parsing has been introduced. In skeleton parsing, grammarians enter minimal labelled bracketing by insetting only those labelled brackets that are uncontroversial and, in sonic cases, by inserting brackets with no labels. The grammar validation routine is de-coupled from the input program so that changes to the grammar can be made without disrupting the input parsing. The strategy also prevents extensive retrospective editing whenever the grammar is modified. Grammar development and parsed databank consauction are not entirely independent however. A subset (10 per cent) of the skeleton pluses are extracted for comparison with the current grammar, while another subset (1 per cent) is checked by independan grammarians. Skeleton parsing will give us a partially parsed databank which should limit the alternative parses compatible with the final grammar. We can either assume each parse is equally likely and use the frequency weighted productions generated by the partially parsed databank to upgrade or downgrade alternative parses or we can use a &apos;restrained&apos; outside/inside algorithm (Baker. 1979) to find the optimal parse.</abstract>

Featurisation The development of the CLAWS tagset and UCREL grammar owes much to the work of Quirk a al. (1985) while the tags themselves have evolved from the Brown tagset (Francis and Kutera. 1982). However, the rules and symbols chosen have been translated into a notation compatible with other theories of grammar. For instance, tags from the extended version of the CLAWS lexicon have been translated into a formalism compatible with the Winchester parser (Sharman. 1988). A program has also been written to map all of the ten thousand productions of the current UCREL grammar into the notation used by the Grammar Development Environment (ODE) (Briscoe et al., 1987; Grover et aL, 1988; Carroll et al.. 1988). This is a preliminary step in the task of recasting the grammar into a feature-based unification formalism which will allow us to radically reduce the size of the rule set while preventing the grammar from overgenerating.</abstract>

An initial system of eleven verb subcategories was proposed, and judgements about which subcategory(ies) each verb belonged to were empirically tested by looking up entries in the microfiche concordance of the tagged Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen corpus (Holland and Johansson. 1982; Johansson et al. 1986) which shows every occurrence of a tagged word in the corpus together with its context. About 2,500 verbs have been coded in this way, and we are now working on a more detailed system of about 80 different verb subcategories using the Lexicon Development Environment of Boguraev et al. (1987). 5. Constituent Analysis The task of implementing a probabilistic parsing algorithm to provide a disambiguated constituent analysis of unrestricted English is more demanding than implementing the word tagging suite, not least because, in order to operate in a manner similar to the word-tagging model, the system requires (1) specification of an appropriate grammar of rules and symbols and (2) the construction of a sufficiently large databank of parsed sentences conforming to the (optimal) grammar specified in (1) to provide statistics of&apos; the relative likelihoods of constituent tag transitions</context>

(1985) while the tags themselves have evolved from the Brown tagset (Francis and Kutera. 1982). However, the rules and symbols chosen have been translated into a notation compatible with other theories of grammar. For instance, tags from the extended version of the CLAWS lexicon have been translated into a formalism compatible with the Winchester parser (Sharman. 1988). A program has also been written to map all of the ten thousand productions of the current UCREL grammar into the notation used by the Grammar Development Environment (ODE) (Briscoe et al., 1987; Grover et aL, 1988; Carroll et al.. 1988). This is a preliminary step in the task of recasting the grammar into a feature-based unification formalism which will allow us to radically reduce the size of the rule set while preventing the grammar from overgenerating. 1 [ VVO* ] 50 85 [ VVO* N&apos; ] 800 86 VVO* J ] 80 87 [ VVO* P ] 900 88 [ VVO* R ] 80 89 [ VVO* Fn ] 100 90 Figure 8: A Fragment of the UCREL grammar 215 PSRULE V85 : VI V.

This work has applications to speech technology, spelling correction. and other areas of natural language processing. Currently, our goal is to provide a language model using transition statistics to disambiguate alternative parses for a speech recognition device. 1. Text Corpora Historically, the use of text corpora to provide empirical data for testing grammatical theories has been regarded as important to varying degrees by philologists and linguists of differing persuasions. The use of corpus citations in grammars and dictionaries pm-dates electronic data processing (Brown, 1984: 34). While most of the generative grammarians of the 60s and 70s ignored campus data, the increased power of the new technology nevertheless points the way to new applications of computerized text corpora in dictionary making, style checking and speech recognition. Computer corpora present the computational linguist with the diversity and complexity of real language which is more challenging for testing language models than intuitively derived examples. Ultimately grammars must be judged by their ability to contend with the real facts of language and not just basic constructs extrapolated by</context>

Experience of the UCREL probabilistic system (Garside and Leech. 1987: 66ff) and suggestions from other researchers prompting new rules resulted in a new context-free grammar of about 6,000 productions creating more steeply nested structures than those of the Sampson grammar. (It was anticipated that steeper nesting would reduce the size of the treebank required to obtain adequate frequency statistics.) The new grammar is defined descriptively in a Parser&apos;s Manual (Leech, 1987) and formalised as a set of context-free phrase-structure productions. Development of the grammar then proceeded in tandem with the construction of a second databank of parsed sentences, fitting, as closely as possible, the rules expressed by the grammar. The new databank comprises extracts from newspaper reports daring from 1979-80 in the Associated Press (AP) corpus. Any difficulties the grammarians had in parsing were resolved, where appropriate, by amending or adding rules to the grammar. This methodology resulted in the grammar 213 - being modified and extended to nearly 10,000 context-fr</context>
