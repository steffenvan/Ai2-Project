Goran Malmgren describes regularities in polysemy: types
of metaphoric transfer of meaning in nouns, regular exten-
sions in verb meanings, and changes in adjective meanings
as the argument changes. While these papers are written
about Swedish, they make one itch to try out these ideas on
an English corpus.

Grishman&apos;s book provides an introductory overview of the
computational linguistics field. Instructors looking for a
good introductory text to use in a course devoted to compu-
tational linguistics should consider this book as a strong
candidate if they wish to emphasize a linguistics approach.
The book consists of five sections: introduction (5%), syntax
analysis (45%), semantic analysis (29%), discourse analy-
sis and information structuring (11%), and language gener-
ation (7%), as well as a short section of 34 exercises
covering all chapters of the book. The book&apos;s emphasis
reflects the predominant trends in the field. Grishman
avoids extreme positions and gives a remarkably neutral
account. By the same token, however, students will hardly
know anything of the controversies that have shaken the
field.
Many different approaches could be taken when attempt-
ing a broad survey of computational linguistics. Artificial
intelligence could be emphasized (including accounts of
past programs), a cognitive science approach might be
attempted, or a linguistic orientation might be the main
emphasis. Grishman elects the linguistic approach, al-
though some artificial intelligence programs are discussed.
The book Natural Language Processing by Harry Tennant
(1981), which covers many Al programs, is referenced
(together with Winograd&apos;s Language as a Cognitive Pro-
cess [1983]) as a supplement in the introductory chapter.
Using both of these books together could make for a very
good course: Grishman&apos;s book provides a strong linguistic
orientation, and Tennant&apos;s book presents practice and appli-
cations. The main difficulty with using both texts together
would be the need to integrate the disparate approaches. By
taking a linguistic viewpoint, Grishman&apos;s text fails fully to
cover many different computational approaches to lan-
guage. For use in a class, the book must be supplemented.
As an example of topics not (sufficiently) covered, con-
sider case frame analysis. The text barely mentions case
frames, and the only analysis of canonical verbs with
agents, instruments, affected entity, etc., occurs in a brief
discussion of Schank&apos;s conceptual dependency theory. Any
instructor wishing to cover the large amount of computa-
tional linguistics research in this area will have to draw
more material from elsewhere.
Grishman does concentrate on the central themes of
linguistics: transformational grammar, translating surface
forms into semantic meaning structures (first-order logic
statements in this case) and, to a lesser extent, discourse
analysis.
In the syntax chapter, Grishman first asks whether syn-
tactic analysis is really necessary, since some researchers
today question the need. He observes that syntactic analy-
sis is the norm and highly useful. He also briefly addresses
the difficulty of parsing nonâ€”well-formed inputs. He then
presents the Chomsky hierarchy of grammars, regular,
context-free, and context-sensitive, followed by a rather
nice example of a context-free grammar and a parser for it.
Sections on transformational grammar and an associated
parser are covered in thorough detail. Augmented phrase-
structure grammars (including NYU&apos;s Linguistic String
Project and ATNs) are also covered. The syntax chapter
concludes with brief discussions of some specific problems:
ambiguities in attaching prepositional phrases to what they
should modify and analyzing coordinate conjunctions. The
latest advances in syntactic theory (government-binding,
X-bar syntax, etc.) have not been included. Nevertheless,
this is a very full chapter that provides quite good coverage
of syntactic parsing techniques.
The semantic analysis chapter introduces predicate logic
as the formal language into which surface forms can be
translated. Grishman also discusses shortcomings of predi-
cate logic as a representation language, after which he
mentions Montague semantics but provides no treatment.
Semantic constraints, semantic grammars, and sublan-
guages are explained briefly but well. Grishman then dis-
cusses some classic semar tic problems, including anaphora
and reference (a very nice treatment), discourse entities,
and noun phrases. The chapter concludes with an interest-
ing discussion of uses of logic as a representation language,
including deducing consequences from sentences using the-
orem provers. As with the syntax chapter, the latest hot
buttons in semantics are not treated (situation semantics,
for example, is not mentioned anywhere) but the coverage
of topics presented contains insightful discussions.
Examples are well chosen and informative. Occasionally,
the reader might wish for more extensive examples.
The syntax and semantics chapters occupy much of the
book. The chapter on discourse and structured representa-
tions is therefore rather short. Grishman reviews what we

Book Reviews Speaking: From Intention to Articulation
might call the &amp;quot;world knowledge/deep reasoning&amp;quot; school of
thought, which is the current paradigm in AI, engendered
by Charniak&apos;s dissertation. He introduces frames, scripts
and plans, MOPS, and information formats (from the
Linguistic String Project, NYU). The chapter concludes
with a discussion of handling dialogue. Although there is a
good discussion of some points, this chapter is somewhat
disappointing because many areas of research are left out
or no examples are given: classic pragmatics is not dis-
cussed at all, story and text grammars are only mentioned,
MOPs are only mentioned, and no mention is made of
rhetorical structure theory. Perhaps the author felt that
this area was not very well settled and therefore should not
be treated extensively. Graduate students, however, should
be treated to open problems as well as to (purported)
solutions.
The language generation chapter is quite brief and treats
sentence generation from a syntactic point of view. A short
discussion on text generation completes the chapter. Clearly,
more could be done with generation even if it is &amp;quot;the poor
cousin&amp;quot; of automated language research.
Grishman spends little time trying to fill in the technical
linguistic background of the reader. There are short intro-
ductions to the Chomsky hierarchy of grammars and pred-
icate logic, but the reader is mostly presumed to be conver-
sant with linguistic theory. The book is, after all, about
computational linguistics. The amount of introductory ma-
terial seems reasonable relative to the expository material.
For computer science graduate students, however, this
account would have to be supplemented with more introduc-
tory linguistics material. The book also contains little philo-
sophical discussion. The author does not attempt to address
the problem of defining meaning, let alone the role of
meaning and language for the concept of mind (a hot topic
for some cognitive psychologists and philosophers). Admit-
tedly, such discussions can become abstruse and perhaps
not very useful, and Grishman typically avoids such topics.
The author frequently writes short evaluations of previ-
ous efforts in an attempt to weigh the contribution of the
work. The evaluations seem very fair; Grishman does not
take doctrinaire stances toward different approaches to
natural language, an excellent way to write an introductory
text. One nice touch of the book is the pursuit of topics
through several different chapters. For example, the prob-
lem of quantifier ordering is discussed both in the semantics
chapter as a representation problem and in the language
generation chapter. Various such themes are pursued
throughout the book.
In summary, this introductory text takes a stand, a point
of view, toward the computational linguistics field. It can
be used most profitably in classes with students who al-
ready have some linguistics background. If supplemented
with additional material, it could also be used for courses
populated by computer science students. The book is inter-
estingly written with many insightful discussions, and it is
the only (introductory) computational linguistics textbook
that looks at the field from a linguist&apos;s point of view.

OVERVIEW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999636678571429">
In Speaking, Pim Levelt has written a majestic book. It is
majestic in its scope, in the power and elegance of its
writing, and in the regal authority with which it describes
cognitive structures and processes that are almost inaccessi-
ble to experimental study. It discusses in 12 chapters how a
speaker produces fluent speech, from concept and intention
to articulation. It is hard to believe that one person could
attempt such a task, let alone that he could complete it so
well. The book is intended primarily for advanced students
in psycholinguistics, but we find it to be better suited to
students of computational linguistics, since we think Levelt
has described how speaking could be done, but not necessar-
ily how it is done by humans.
The book contains many technical terms and concepts,
clearly introduced and used, and avoids statistics and com-
puter jargon. Very occasionally, traces of Dutch creep in,
though not obtrusively. Blackboardchalk, passingnote, and
swimmingwater are given as examples of English com-
pound words; bank is said to have as its two meanings
&amp;quot;financial institution&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;furniture&amp;quot;. Despite these small
lapses, Levelt&apos;s knowledge about English (as well as his
ability to use it) far surpasses that of most English speakers
untrained in linguistics.
The book is well designed and carefully proofread. There
is a good index, and more than 600 references. We found
only three misprints in 500 pages of text, as well as one
&amp;quot;cognitive misprint&amp;quot; that is amusing because it occurs in a
discussion of similar phenomena in speech (the commen-
