<bodyText confidence="0.99495">
In this paper we compare three approaches to
adverbial positioning using lexical, syntactic,
semantic and sentence-level features. We find
that: (a), one- and two-stage classification-
based approaches can achieve almost 86% ac-
curacy in determining the absolute position of
adverbials; (b) a classifier trained with only
syntactic features gives performance close to
that of a classifier trained with all features; and
(c) a surface realizer incorporating a two-stage
classifier for adverbial positioning as the sec-
ond stage gives improvements of at least 10%
in simple string accuracy over a baseline real-
izer for sentences containing adverbials.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99407562962963">
The job of a surface realizer is to transform an input
semantic/syntactic form into a sequence of words.
This task includes word choice, and word and con-
stituent ordering. In English, the positions of re-
quired elements of a sentence, verb phrase or noun
phrase are relatively fixed. However, many sen-
tences also include adverbials whose position is not
fixed (Figure 1). There may be several appropriate
positions for an adverbial in a particular context, but
other positions give output that is non-idiomatic or
disfluent, ambiguous, or incoherent.
Some computational research has included mod-
els for adjunct ordering (e.g. (Ringger et al., 2004;
Marciniak and Strube, 2004; Elhadad et al., 2001)).
However, this is the first computational study to look
specifically at adverbials. Adverbial positioning has
long been studied in linguistics (e.g. (Keyser, 1968;
Allen and Cruttenden, 1974; Ernst, 1984; Haider,
2000)). Most linguistic research focuses on whether
adverbial placement is functional or semantic in na-
ture. However, Costa (2004) takes a more flexi-
ble feature-based approach that uses: lexical fea-
tures (e.g. phonological shape, ambiguity of mean-
ing, categorical status); syntactic features (e.g. pos-
sible adjunction sites, directionality of adjunction,
domain of modification); and information structure
features (e.g. focus, contrast). We decided to evalu-
ate Costa’s approach computationally, using features
automatically extracted from an annotated corpus.
In this paper, we compare three approaches to ad-
verbial positioning: a simple baseline approach us-
ing lexical and syntactic features, and one- and two-
stage classification-based approaches using lexical,
syntactic, semantic and sentence-level features. We
apply these approaches in a hybrid surface realizer
that uses a probabilistic grammar to produce real-
ization alternatives, and a second-stage classifier to
select among alternatives. We find that: (a) One-
and two-stage classification-based approaches can
achieve almost 86% accuracy in determining the ab-
solute position of adverbials; (b) A classifier trained
with only syntactic features gives performance close
to that of a classifier trained with all features; and (c)
A surface realizer using a two-stage classifier for ad-
verbial positioning can get improvements of at least
10% in simple string accuracy over a baseline real-
izer for sentences containing adverbials.
As well as being useful for surface realization, a
model of adverbial ordering can be used in machine
translation (e.g. (Ogura et al., 1997)), language
learning software (e.g. (Leacock, 2007; Burstein et
al., 2004)), and automatic summarization (e.g. (El-
hadad et al., 2001; Clarke and Lapata, 2007; Mad-
nani et al., 2007)).

2 Data and Features

<bodyText confidence="0.999358363636364">
From the sentences in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)
and Switchboard (SWBD) sections of the Penn
Treebank III (Marcus et al., 1999), we extracted all
NP, PP and ADVP phrases labeled with the adver-
bial tags -BNF, -DIR, -EXT, -LOC, -MNR, -PRP,
-TMP or -ADV. These phrases mostly modify S con-
stituents (including RRC, S, SBAR, SBARQ, SINV,
SQ), VP constituents, or NP constituents (includ-
ing NP and WHNP), but also modify other adjuncts
(PP, ADJP or ADVP) and other phrase types (FRAG,
INTJ, LST, NAC, PRT, QP, TOP, UCP, X).

For each adverbial, we automatically extracted
lexical, syntactic, semantic and discourse features.
We included features similar to those in (Costa,
2004) and from our own previous research on prepo-
sitional phrase ordering (Zhong and Stent, 2008).
Due to the size of our data set, we could only use
features that can be extracted automatically, so some
features were approximated. We dropped adverbials
for which we could not get features, such as empty
adverbials. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the resulting
data. A list of the features we used in our classifi-
cation experiment appears in Table 3. We withheld
10% of this data for our realization experiment.

is a part. An adverbial may have non-adverbial sib-
lings, whose position is typically fixed. It may also
have other adverbial siblings. In the sentence in Fig-
ure 1, at your bank has one adverbial and two non-
adverbial siblings. If this adverbial were placed at
positions VP:0 or VP:1 the resulting sentence would
be disfluent but meaningful; placed at position VP:2
the resulting sentence is fluent, meaningful and id-
iomatic. (In this sentence, both orderings of the two
adverbials at position VP:2 are valid.)

3.1 Approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951777777778">
We experimented with three approaches to adverbial
positioning.
Baseline Our baseline approach has two stages. In
the first stage the position of each adverbial with
respect to its non-adverbial siblings is determined:
each adverbial is assigned the most likely position
given its lexical head and category (PP, NN, ADVP).
In the second stage, the relative ordering of adjacent
adverbials is determined in a pairwise fashion (cf.
(Marciniak and Strube, 2004)): the ordering of a pair
of adverbials is assigned to be the most frequent in
the training data, given the lexical head, adverbial
phrase type, and category of each adverbial.
One-stage For our one-stage classification-based
approach, we determine the position of all adver-
bials in a phrase at one step. There is one feature
vector for each phrase containing at least one adver-
bial. It contains features for all non-adverbial sib-
lings in realization order, and then for each adverbial
sibling in alphabetical order by lexical head. The la-
bel is the order of the siblings. For example, for the
S-modifying adverbial in Figure 1, the label would
be 2 0 1, where 0 = “she”, 1 = “cashed” and 2 =
“Then”. If there are n siblings, then there are n!
possible labels for each feature vector, so the perfor-
mance of this classifier by chance would be .167 if
each adverbial has on average three siblings.

Table 3: Features used for determining adverbial positions. We did not find phrases with more than 5 adverbial siblings
or more more than 5 non-adverbial siblings. If a phrase did not have 5 adverbial or non-adverbial siblings, NA values
were used in the features for those siblings.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998505">
Two-stage For our two-stage classification-based
approach, we first determine the position of each ad-
verbial in a phrase in relation to its non-adverbial
siblings, and then the relative positions of adjacent
adverbials. For the first stage we use a classifier.
There is one feature vector for each adverbial. It
contains features for all non-adverbial siblings in re-
alization order, then for each adverbial sibling in al-
phabetical order by lexical head, and finally for the
target adverbial itself. The label is the position of
the target adverbial with respect to the non-adverbial
siblings. For our example sentence in Figure 1, the
label for “Then” would be 0; for “at the bank” would
be 2, and for “on Tuesday” would be 2. If there are n
non-adverbial siblings, then there are n + 1 possible
labels for each feature vector, so the performance of
this classifier by chance would be .25 if each adver-
bial has on average three non-adverbial siblings.
For the second stage we use the same second stage
as the baseline approach.

We use 10-fold cross-validation to compute perfor-

3.3 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980333333333">
Our classification results are shown in Table 4. The
one- and two-stage approaches both significantly
outperform baseline. Also, the two-stage approach
outperforms the one-stage approach for WSJ.
The decision trees using all features are quite
large. We tried dropping feature sets to see if we
could get smaller trees without large drops in per-
formance. We found that for all data sets, the
models containing only syntactic features perform
only about 1% worse for one-stage classification and
only about 3% worse for two-stage classification,
while in most cases giving much smaller trees (1015
[WSJ] and 972 [SWBD] nodes for the one-stage ap-
proach; 1008 [WSJ] and 877 [SWBD] for the two-
stage approach). This is somewhat surprising given
Costa’s arguments about the need for lexical and dis-
course features; it may be due to errors introduced
by approximating discourse features automatically,
as well as to data sparsity in the lexical features.
There are only small performance differences be-
tween the classifiers for speech and those for text.

alizer. We automatically extracted a probabilistic
lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar from the whole
WSJ and SWBD corpora minus our held-out data,
using the method described in (Zhong and Stent,
2005). We automatically re-realized all adverbial-
containing sentences in our held-out data (10%), af-
ter first automatically constructing input using the
method described in (Zhong and Stent, 2005).
We compute realization performance using sim-

is reported in Table 4. Both classification-based ap-
proaches outperform baseline, with the two-stage
approach performing best for WSJ with either met-

In this paper, we tested classification-based ap-
proaches to adverbial positioning. We showed that
we can achieve good results using syntactic features
alone, with small improvements from adding lexi-
cal, semantic and sentence-level features. We also
showed that use of a model for adverbial position-
ing leads to improved surface realization. In future
work, we plan a human evaluation of our results to
see if more features could lead to performance gains.

(In this sentence, both orderings of the two adverbials at position VP:2 are valid.) 3.1 Approaches We experimented with three approaches to adverbial positioning. Baseline Our baseline approach has two stages. In the first stage the position of each adverbial with respect to its non-adverbial siblings is determined: each adverbial is assigned the most likely position given its lexical head and category (PP, NN, ADVP). In the second stage, the relative ordering of adjacent adverbials is determined in a pairwise fashion (cf. (Marciniak and Strube, 2004)): the ordering of a pair of adverbials is assigned to be the most frequent in the training data, given the lexical head, adverbial phrase type, and category of each adverbial. One-stage For our one-stage classification-based approach, we determine the position of all adverbials in a phrase at one step. There is one feature vector for each phrase containing at least one adverbial. It contains features for all non-adverbial siblings in realization order, and then for each adverbial sibling in alphabetical order by lexical head. The label is the order of the siblings.
