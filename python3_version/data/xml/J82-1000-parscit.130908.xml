Affiliations: The ACL is a constituent member of the
American Federation of Information Processing Socie-
ties, and is also associated with the International Com-
mittee on Computational Linguistics.
Subscriptions to the AJCL are available only through
membership in the ACL. Each subscription includes both
hard-copy and microfiche versions of the Journal.
Annual membership dues are $15 for individuals and
$30 for institutions. Joint memberships for couples are
available for $20, but provide only one subscription.
Postage: The AJCL is normally mailed bulk-rate. First
class mailing is available in North America for an addi-
tional annual charge of $6. Air-printed mailing is availa-
ble overseas for an additional annual charge of $12.
Back issues of the AJCL may be ordered at annual rates
of $15 for individuals and $30 for institutions. The first
five volumes (1974-1978) are available only on micro-
fiche; Volumes 6 and 7 (1980 and 1981) are available in
both hard-copy and microfiche form; first class mailing
is an additional $6, and air-printed mailing is an addi-
tional $12. The AJCL was not published during 1979.
Payments for dues or back issues should be sent to the
ACL Secretary-Treasurer at the address given above.
Checks should be made out to the Association for Com-
putational Linguistics (or to ACL) and should be payable
in U.S. dollars. There is an additional $2 charge for
bank processing costs for checks that are not drawn on
U.S. banks.
Address changes should be sent to the ACL
Secretary-Treasurer at the address given above.
A Note from the Editor:
This issue of the American Journal of Computational Linguistics (AJCL) is
the first of 1982 to appear, although the fourth quarter issue of 1981 was
distributed earlier this year. When we took over as editors pro tern., we
inherited a number of papers in the process of being reviewed by referees or
being revised by authors, but no papers in final form awaiting publication. The
process of keeping after referees to turn in their reviews, encouraging authors
of conditionally accepted papers to make necessary revisions, and producing
the final version of revised papers in camera-ready form has proved to be
much more tortuous and time-consuming than we anticipated. Consequently,
this first issue of 1982 is coming out in October. Prospects for future issues
are brighter. We now have in hand the proceedings of the workshop on
&amp;quot;Applied Computational Linguistics in Perspective&amp;quot;, jointly organized by
NRL, ACL, and NSF and funded by ONR, which took place June 26-27,
1981, at Stanford University. We also have a number of accepted papers
being revised by their authors. Consequently, it is expected that the April-June
issue will follow close on the heels of this one.
We are happy to report that our interim editorship is over, and that James
Allen of the University of Rochester will be taking over on a permanent basis
starting with the third issue of 1982. Future contributions should be sent to
him at the address given on the inside back cover. It is clear that one or
possibly two issues of 1982 will have to appear in 1983. Our goal is to limit
this to the last issue of 1982, and with the cooperation of reviewers and
authors, this should be possible. We will delay the thanks we owe to everyone
who has assisted us until the next and (for us) final issue. In the meantime, we
would like to thank you readers for your patience, and to encourage you to
hang in there; more issues are on the way.
