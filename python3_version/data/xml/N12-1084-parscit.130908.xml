We introduce the social study of bullying to
the NLP community. Bullying, in both physi-
cal and cyber worlds (the latter known as cy-
berbullying), has been recognized as a seri-
ous national health issue among adolescents.
However, previous social studies of bully-
ing are handicapped by data scarcity, while
the few computational studies narrowly re-
strict themselves to cyberbullying which ac-
counts for only a small fraction of all bullying
episodes. Our main contribution is to present
evidence that social media, with appropriate
natural language processing techniques, can
be a valuable and abundant data source for the
study of bullying in both worlds. We iden-
tify several key problems in using such data
sources and formulate them as NLP tasks, in-
cluding text classification, role labeling, senti-
ment analysis, and topic modeling. Since this
is an introductory paper, we present baseline
results on these tasks using off-the-shelf NLP
solutions, and encourage the NLP community
to contribute better models in the future.

1 Introduction to Bullying
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998898075">
Bullying, also called peer victimization, has been
recognized as a serious national health issue by
the White House (The White House, 2011), the
American Academy of Pediatrics (The American
Academy of Pediatrics, 2009), and the American
Psychological Association (American Psychological
Association, 2004). One is being bullied or victim-
ized when he or she is exposed repeatedly over time
to negative actions on the part of others (Olweus,
1993). Far-reaching and insidious sequelae of bul-
lying include intrapersonal problems (Juvonen and
Graham, 2001; Jimerson, Swearer, and Espelage,
2010) and lethal school violence in the most extreme
cases (Moore et al., 2003). Youth who experience
peer victimization report more symptoms of depres-
sion, anxiety, loneliness, and low self-worth com-
pared to their nonvictimized counterparts (Bellmore
et al., 2004; Biggs, Nelson, and Sampilo, 2010; Gra-
ham, Bellmore, and Juvonen, 2007; Hawker and
Boulton, 2000). Other research suggests that victim-
ized youth have more physical complaints (Fekkes
et al., 2006; Nishina and Juvonen, 2005; Gini and
Pozzoli, 2009). Victimized youth are absent from
school more often and get lower grades than nonvic-
timized youth (Ladd, Kochenderfer, and Coleman,
1997; Schwartz et al., 2005; Juvonen and Gross,
2008).
Bullying happens traditionally in the physical
world and, recently, online as well; the latter is
known as cyberbullying (Cassidy, Jackson, and
Brown, 2009; Fredstrom, Adams, and Gilman,
2011; Wang, Iannotti, and Nansel, 2009; Vande-
bosch and Cleemput, 2009). Bullying usually starts
in primary school, peaks in middle school, and lasts
well into high school and beyond (Nansel et al.,
2001; Smith, Madsen, and Moody, 1999; Cook et
al., 2010). Across a national sample of students in
grades 4 through 12, 38% of students reported be-
ing bullied by others and 32% reported bullying oth-
ers (Vaillancourt et al., 2010).

1.1 The Structure of a Bullying Episode
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999474464285714">
Bullying takes multiple forms, most noticeably face-
to-face physical (e.g., hitting), verbal (e.g., name-
calling), and relational (e.g., exclusion) (Archer and
Coyne, 2005; Little et al., 2003; Nylund et al.,
2007). Cyberbullying reflects a venue (other than
face to face contact) through which verbal and rela-
tional forms can occur.
A main reason individuals are targeted with bul-
lying is perceived differences, i.e., any characteristic
that makes an individual stand out differently from
his or her peers. These include race, socio-economic
status, gender, sexuality, physical appearance, and
behaviors.
Participants in a bullying episode take well-
defined roles (see Figure 1). More than one person
can have the same role in a bullying episode. Roles
include the bully (or bullies), the victims, bystanders
(who saw the event but did not intervene), defend-
ers of the victim, assistants to the bully (who did
not initiate but went along with the bully), and rein-
forcers (who did not directly join in with the bully
but encouraged the bully by laughing, for exam-
ple) (Salmivalli, 1999). This recognition that bully-
ing involves multiple roles makes evident the broad-
ranging impact of bullying; any child or adolescent
is susceptible to participation in bullying, even those
who are not directly involved (Janosz et al., 2008;
Rivers et al., 2009).

1.2 Some Scientific Questions NLP can Answer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951789473684">
Like many complex social issues, effective solutions
to bullying go beyond technology alone and require
the concerted efforts of parents, educators, and law
enforcement. To guide these efforts it is paramount
to study the dynamics of bullying. Such study criti-
cally depends on text in the form of self-report social
study surveys and electronic communication among
participants. Such text is often fragmental, noisy,
and covers only part of a bullying episode from a
specific role’s perspective. As such, the NLP com-
munity can help answer a host of scientific ques-
tions: Which pieces of text refer to the same under-
lying bullying episode? What is the form, reason,
location, time, etc. of a bullying episode? Who are
the participants of each episode, and what are their
roles? How does a person’s role evolve over time?
This paper presents our initial investigation on some
of these questions, while leaving others to future re-
search by the NLP community.

1.3 Limitations of the State-of-the-Art
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974777777778">
The social science study of bullying has a long his-
tory. However, a fundamental problem there is data
acquisition. The standard approach is to conduct
time-consuming personal surveys in schools. The
sample size is typically in the hundreds, and partici-
pants typically write 3 to 4 sentences about each bul-
lying episode (Nishina and Bellmore, 2010). Such a
small corpus fails to assess the true frequency of bul-
lying over the population, and cannot determine the
evolution of roles. The computational study of bul-
lying is largely unexplored, with the exception of a
few studies on cyberbullying (Lieberman, Dinakar,
and Jones, 2011; Dinakar, Reichart, and Lieber-
man, 2011; Ptaszynski et al., 2010; Kontostathis,
Edwards, and Leatherman, 2010; Bosse and Stam,
2011; Latham, Crockett, and Bandar, 2010). These
studies did not consider the much more frequent bul-
lying episodes in the physical world.

2 Bullying Traces in Social Media
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999436">
The main contribution of the present paper is not
on novel algorithms, but rather on presenting evi-
dence that social media data and off-the-shelf NLP
tools can be an effective combination for the study
of bullying. Participants of a bullying episode (in ei-
ther physical or cyber venues) often post social me-
dia text about the experience. We collectively call
such social media posts bullying traces. Bullying

traces include but far exceed incidences of cyberbul-
lying. Most of them are in fact responses to a bul-
lying experience – the actual attack is hidden from
view. Bullying traces are valuable, albeit fragmental
and noisy, data which we can use to piece together
the underlying episodes.
In the rest of the paper, we focus on publicly
available Twitter “tweets,” though our methods
apply readily to other social media services, too.
Here are some examples of bullying traces:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997872307692308">
• Reporting a bullying episode: “some tweens
got violent on the n train, the one boy got off
after blows 2 the chest... Saw him cryin as he
walkd away :( bullying not cool”
• Accusing someone as a bully: “@USERNAME
i didnt jump around and act like a monkey T T
which ofyour eye saw that i acted like a monkey
:( you’re a bully”
• Revealing self as a victim: “People bullied me
for being fat. 7 years later, I was diagnosed
with bulimia. Are you happy now?”
• Cyber-bullying direct attack: “Lauren is a fat
cow MOO BITCH”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999809863636364">
Bullying traces are abundant. From the publicly
available 2011 TREC Microblog track corpus (16
million tweets sampled between January 23rd and
February 8th, 2011), we uniformly sampled 990
tweets for manual inspection by five experienced an-
notators (not the authors of the present paper). Of
the 990 tweets, the annotators labeled 617 as non-
English, 371 as English but not bullying traces, and
2 as English bullying traces. The Maximum Likeli-
hood Estimate of the frequency of English bullying
traces, out of all tweets, is 2/990 Pz� 0.002. The
exact Binomial 95% confidence interval is (0.0002,
0.0073). This is a tiny fraction. Nonetheless, it rep-
resents an abundance of tweets: by some estimates,
Twitter produces 250 million tweets per day in late
2011. Even with the lower bound in the confidence
interval, it translates into 50,000 English bullying
traces per day. The actual number can be much
higher.
Bullying traces contain valuable information. For
example, Figure 2 shows the daily number of bully-
ing traces identified by our classifier, to be discussed

in section 3. A weekly pattern was obvious in late
August. A small peak was caused by 14-year-old
bullying victim Jamey Rodemeyer’s suicide on Sept.
18. This was followed by a large peak after Lady
Gaga dedicated a song to him on Sept. 24.
In the following sections, we identify several key
problems in using social media for the study of bul-
lying. We formulate each key problem as an NLP
task. We then present standard off-the-shelf NLP ap-
proaches to establish baseline performances. Since
bullying traces account for only a tiny fraction of all
tweets, it posed a significant challenge for our an-
notators to find enough bullying traces without la-
beling an unreasonable amount of tweets. For this
reason, in the rest of the paper we restrict ourselves
to an “enriched dataset.” This enriched dataset is ob-
tained by collecting tweets using the public Twitter
streaming API, such that each tweet contains at least
one of the following keywords: “bully, bullied, bul-
lying.” We further removed re-tweets (the analogue
of forwarded emails) by excluding tweets containing
the acronym “RT.” The enrichment process is meant
to retain many first-hand bullying traces at the cost
of a selection bias.

3 NLP Task A: Text Categorization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998988666666667">
One important task is to distinguish bullying traces
from other social media posts. Our enriched dataset,
generated by simple keyword filtering, still contains
many irrelevant tweets. For example, “Forced veg-
anism by removing a persons choice is just another
form ofbullying” is not abullying trace, since it does

not describe a bullying episode. Our task is to dis-
tinguish posts like this from true bullying traces such
as those mentioned in the previous section. We for-
mulate it as a binary text categorization task.
Methods. The same annotators who labeled the
TREC corpus labeled 1762 tweets sampled uni-
formly from the enriched dataset on August 6, 2011.
Among them, 684 (39%) were labeled as bullying
traces.
Following (Settles, 2011), these 1762 tweets were
case-folded but without any stemming or stop-
word removal. Any user mentions preceded by a
“@” were replaced by the anonymized user name
“@USERNAME”. Any URLs starting with “http”
were replaced by the token “HTTPLINK”. Hashtags
(compound words following “#”) were not split and
were treated as a single token. Emoticons, such as
“:)” or “:D”, were also included as tokens.
After these preprocessing procedures, we created
three different sets of feature representations: un-
igrams (1g), unigrams+bigrams (1g2g), and POS-
colored unigrams+bigrams (1g2gPOS). POS tag-
ging was done with the Stanford CoreNLP pack-
age (Toutanova et al., 2003). POS-coloring was
done by expanding each token into token:POS.
We chose four commonly used text classifiers,
namely, Naive Bayes, SVM with linear kernel
(SVM(linear)), SVM with RBF kernel (SVM(RBF))
and Logistic Regression (equivalent to MaxEnt). We
used the WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) implementation
for the first three (calling LibSVM (Chang and Lin,
2011) with WEKA’s interfaces for SVMs), and the
L1General package (Schmidt, Fung, and Rosales,
2007) for the fourth.
We held out 262 tweets for test, and systemat-
ically varied training set size among the remain-
ing tweets, from 100 to 1500 with the step-size
100. We tuned all parameters jointly by 5-fold
cross validation on the training set with the grid
12−8, 2−6,... , 28}. All the four text classifiers were
trained on the training sets and tested on the test set.
The whole procedure was repeated 30 times for each
feature representation.
Results. Figure 3 reports the held-out set accu-
racy as the training set size increases. The error bars
are ±1 standard error. With the largest training set
size (1500), the combination of SVM(linear) + 1g
achieves an average accuracy 79.7%. SVM(linear)
+ 1g2g achieves 81.3%, which is significantly bet-
ter (t-test, p = 4 x 10−6). It shows that in-
cluding bigrams can significantly improve the clas-
sification performance. SVM(linear) + 1g2gPOS
achieves 81.6%, though the improvement is not sta-
tistically significant (p = 0.088), which indicates
that POS coloring does not help too much on this
task. SVM(RBF) gives similar performance, Logis-
tic Regression is slightly worse and Naive Bayes is
much worse, for a large range of training set sizes.
In summary, SVM(linear) + 1g2g is the preferred
model because of its accuracy and simplicity. We
also note that these accuracies are much better than
the majority class baseline of 61%. On the held-
out set, SVM(linear) + 1g2g achieves precision
P=0.76, recall R=0.79, and F-measure 0.77.
Discussions. Note that the learning curves are
still increasing, suggesting that better accuracy can
be obtained if we annotate more training data. As to
why the best accuracy is not close to 1, one hypoth-
esis is noisy labels caused by intrinsic disagreement
among labelers. Tweets are short and some are am-
biguous. Without prior knowledge about the users
and their other tweets, labelers interpret the tweets
in their own ways. For example, for the very short
tweet feels like a bully our annotators disagreed
on whether it is a bullying trace. Labelers may have
different views on these ambiguous tweets and cre-
ated noisy bullying trace labels.
A future direction is to categorize bullying traces
at a finer granularity, e.g., by forms, reasons, etc.
This can be solved by multi-class classification
methods. Another direction is to extend the clas-
sifiers from the “enriched data” to the full range of
tweets. Recall that the difference is whether we pre-
filter the tweets by keywords. Clearly, they have
different tweet distributions. Techniques used for
covariate shift may be adapted to solve this prob-
lem (Blitzer, 2008).

Identifying participants’ bullying roles (Figure 1) is
another important task, which is also a prerequi-

time. For bullying traces in social media, we aug-

like a bystander) and accuser (accusing someone as
the bully). Both roles can be a victim, a defender,
or a bystander in the traditional sense – there is just
not enough information in the tweet. Accuser (A),
bully (B), reporter (R) and victim (V) are the four
most frequent roles observed in social media. We
merged all remaining roles into a generic category
“other” (O) in the following study. Our task is to
classify the role (A, B, R, V, O) of the tweet author
and any person-mentions in a tweet. For example,
AUTHOR(R): “We(R) visited my(V) cousin(V) today
&amp; #Itreallymakesmemad that he(V) barely eats bec
he(V) was bullied. :( I(R) wanna kick the crap out
of those mean(B) kids(B).” Note that the special to-
ken “AUTHOR” is introduced to hold the label of
the author’s role.
Labeling author’s role and other person-mention’s
role are two different sub-tasks. The former can be
formulated as a multi-class text classification task;
the latter is better formulated as a sequential tagging
task. We will discuss them separately below.

10-fold cross validation to evaluate all combinations
of classifiers and feature sets. Like before, we tuned
all parameters jointly by 5-fold cross validation on
the training set with the grid 12−8, 2−6,.. . , 281.
Results. The best combination is SVM(linear)
+ 1g2g with cross validation accuracy 61%. Even
though it is far from perfect, it is significantly better
than the majority class (R) baseline of 43%. It shows

roles.
Table 1 shows the confusion matrix of the best
model. Most R and V authors are correctly rec-
ognized, but not B and A. The model misclassified
many authors as R. It is possible that the tweets au-
thored by reporters are diverse in topic and style, and
overlap with other classes in the feature space.
Discussions. As tweets are short, our feature rep-
resentation may not be the best for predicting au-
thor’s role. Many authors mentioned themselves
in the tweets with first-person pronouns, making
it advantageous to consider joint classification by
merging sections 4.1 and 4.2. Furthermore, assum-
ing roles change infrequently, it may be helpful to
jointly classify many tweets authored by the same
person.

nov and Roth, 2009; Ritter et al., 2011) as a sub-
routine to identify named person entities, though we

Labeling (SRL) (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pun-
yakanok, Roth, and Yih, 2008) but differs critically
in that our roles are not tied to specific verb predi-
cates.
Methods. Our annotators labeled each token
in the 684 bullying traces with the tags A, B,
R, V, O and N for not-a-person. There are
11,751 tokens in total. Similar to the sequen-
tial tagging formulation (M`arquez et al., 2005; Liu
et al., 2010), we trained a linear CRF to label
each token in the tweet with the CRF++ package
(http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/).
As standard in linear CRFs, we used pairwise la-
bel features f(yi−1, yi) and input features f(yi, w),
where f’s are binary indicator functions on the val-
ues of their arguments and w is the text. In the fol-
lowing, we introduce our input features using the ex-
ample tweet “@USERIAME i’ll tell vinny you bul-
lied me.” with the current token wi =“vinny”:
(i) The token, lemma, and POS tag of the
five tokens around position i. For example,
f�ully,wi_1=tell(yi, w) will be 1 if the current to-
ken has label yi = “bully00 and wi−1 = “tell00.
Similarly, f�ieti.,POSi+2=V BD(yi,w) will be 1 if
yi = “victim00 and the POS of wi+2 is VBD.
(ii) The NER tag of wi.
(iii) Whether wi is a person mention. This is a
Boolean feature which is true if wi is tagged as PER-
SON by NER, or if POSi = pronoun (excluding
“it”), or if wi is @USERNAME. For example, this
feature is true on “vinny” because it is tagged as
PERSON by NER.
(iv) The relevant verb vi of wi, vi’s lemma, POS,
and the combination of vi with the lemma/POS of
wi. The relevant verb vi of wi is defined by the
semantic dependency between wi and the verb, if
one exists. Otherwise, vi is the closest verb to wi.
For example, the relevant verb of wi = “vinny00 is
vi = “tell00 because “vinny” is found as the object
of “tell” by dependency parsing.
(v) The distance, relative position (left or right)
and dependency type between vi and wi. For ex-
ample, the distance between “vinny” and its relevant
verb “tell” is 1. “vinny” is on the right and is the
object of “tell”.
The lemma, POS tags, NER tags and dependency
relationship were obtained using Stanford CoreNLP.

same input features as CRF. Classification is done
individually on each token. We randomly split the
684 tweets into 10 folds and conducted cross vali-
dation based on this split. For CRF, we trained on
the tweets in the training set with their labels, and
tested the model on those in the test set. For SVM,
we trained and tested at the token level in the corre-
sponding sets.
Results. Table 2 reports the cross validation ac-
curacy, precision, recall and F-1 measure. Accu-
racy measures the percentage of tokens correctly
assigned the groundtruth labels, including N (not-
a-person) tokens. Precision measures the fraction
of correctly labeled person-mention tokens over all
tokens that are not N according to the algorithm.
Recall measures the fraction of correctly labeled
person-mention tokens over all tokens that are not
N according to the groundtruth. F-1 is the har-
monic mean of precision and recall. Linear CRF
achieved an accuracy 0.87, which is higher than the
baseline of majority class predictor (N, 0.80) (t-
test, p = 10−10). However, the precision and re-
call is low potentially because the tweets are short
and noisy. CRF outperforms SVM in all measures,
showing the value of joint classification.
Discussions. Table 3 shows the confusion ma-
trix of person-mention role labeling by linear CRF.
There are several reasons for these mistakes. First,
words like “teacher”, “sister”, or “girl” were missed
by our person mention feature (iii). Second, the
NER tagger was trained on formal English which is
a mismatch for the informal tweets, leading to NER
errors. Third, noisy labeling continues to affect ac-
curacy. For example, some annotators considered
“other people” as an entity and labeled both tokens
as person mentions; others labeled “people” only.
In general, bullying role labeling may be im-
proved by jointly considering multiple tweets at the
episode level. Co-reference resolution should im-
prove the performance as well.

5 NLP Task C: Sentiment Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929228571428">
Sentiment analysis on participants involved in a bul-
lying episode is of significant importance. As Fig-
ure 4 suggests, there are a wide range of emotions in
bullying traces. For example, victims usually expe-
rience negative emotions such as depression, anxiety
and loneliness; Some emotions are more violent or
even suicidal. Detecting at-risk individuals via sen-
timent analysis enables potential interventions. In
addition, social scientists are interested in sentiment
analysis of bullying participants to understand their
motivations.
In the present paper we investigate a special form
of sentiment in bullying traces, namely teasing. We
observed that many bullying traces were written jok-
ingly. One example of a teasing post is “@USER-
NAME lol stop being a cyber bully lol :p.” Teas-
ing may indicate the lack of severity of a bullying
episode; It may also be a manifest of coping strate-
gies in bullying victims. Therefore, there is consid-
erable interest among social scientists to understand
teasing in bullying traces.
Methods. One first task is to identify teasing bul-
lying traces. We formulated it as a binary classifi-
cation problem, similar to classic positive/negative
sentiment classification (Pang and Lee, 2004). Our
annotators labeled each of the 684 bullying traces in
Task A as teasing (99) or not (585). We used the
same feature representations, classifiers and param-
eter tuning as in Section 3 and 10-fold cross valida-
tion procedure.
Results. The best cross validation accuracy of
89% is obtained by SVM(linear) + 1g2g. This
is significantly better than the majority class (not-
teasing) baseline of 86% (t-test, p = 10−33). It
shows that even simple features and off-the-shelf

classifier can detect some signal in the text. How-
ever, the accuracy is not high. Table 4 shows the
confusion matrix. About half of the tease examples
were misclassified. We found several possible ex-
planations. First, teasing is not always accompanied
by joking emoticons or tokens like “LOL,” “lmao,”
“haha.” For example, “I may bully you but I love
you lots. Just like jelly tots!” and “Been bullied into
watching a scary film, I love my friends!” Such teas-
ing sentiment requires deeper NLP or much larger
training sets. Second, tweets containing those jok-
ing emoticons and tokens are not necessarily teas-
ing. For example, “This Year I’m Standing Up For
The Kids That Are Being Bullied All Over The Na-
tion :) .” Third, the joking tokens have diverse
spellings. For example, “lol” was spelled as “loll,”
“lolol,” “lollll,” “loool,” “LOOOOOOOOOOOL”;
“haha” was spelled as “HAHAHAHA,” “Hahaha,”
“Bwahahaha,” “ahahahah,” “hahah.”
Discussions. Specialized word normalization for
social media text may significantly improve perfor-
mance. For example, word lengthening can be iden-
tified and used as cues for teasing (Brody and Di-
akopoulos, 2011). Teasing is diverse in its form
and content. Our training set is perhaps too small.
Borrowing training data from other corpora, such as
one-liner jokes (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005),
may be helpful.

6 NLP Task D: Latent Topic Modeling
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998954545454545">
Methods. Given the large volume of bullying traces,
methods for automatically analyzing what people
are talking about are needed. Latent topic models
allow us to extract the main topics in bullying traces
to facilitate understanding. We used latent Dirich-
let allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003) as
our exploratory tool. Specifically, we ran a collapsed
Gibbs sampling implementation of LDA (Griffiths
and Steyvers, 2004).
The corpus consists of 188K enriched tweets from
Aug. 21 to Sept. 17, 2011 that are classified as
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99517">
662
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953111111111">
bullying traces by our classifier in Task A. We per-
formed stopword removal and further removed word
types occurring less than 7 times, resulting in a vo-
cabulary of size 12K. We set the number of topics
to 50, Dirichlet parameter for word multinomials to
Q = 0.01, Dirichlet parameter for document topic
multinomial to α = 1, and ran Gibbs sampling for
10K iterations.
Results. Space precludes a complete list of top-
ics. Figure 4 shows six selected topics discovered by
LDA. Recall that each topic in LDA is a multinomial
distribution over the vocabulary. The figure shows
each topic’s top 20 words with size proportional to
p(word I topic). The topic names are manually as-
signed.
These topics contain semantically coherent words
relevant to bullying: (feelings) how people feel
about bullying; (suicide) discussions of suicide
events; (family) sibling names probably used in a
good buddy sense; (school) the school environment
where bullying commonly occurs; (verbal bullying)
derogatory words such as fat and ugly; (physical bul-
lying) actions such as kicking and pushing.
We also ran a variational inference implementa-
tion of LDA (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003). The re-
sults were similar, thus we omit discussion of them.
Discussions. Some recovered topics, including
the ones shown here, provide valuable insight into
bullying traces. However, not all topics are inter-
pretable to social scientists. It may be helpful to al-
low scientists the ability to combine their domain
knowledge with latent topic modeling, thus arriv-
ing at more useful topics. For example, the scien-
tists can formulate their knowledge in First-Order
Logic, which can then be combined with LDA with
stochastic optimization (Andrzejewski et al., 2011).

7 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977666666667">
We introduced social media as a large-scale, near
real-time, dynamic data source for the study of bul-
lying. Social media offers a broad range of bully-
ing traces that include but go beyond cyberbullying.
In the present paper, we have identified several key
problems in using social media to study bullying and
formulated them as familiar NLP tasks. Our baseline
performance with standard off-the-shelf approaches
shows that it is feasible to learn from bullying traces.

Much work remains in this new research direc-
tion. In the short term, we need to develop spe-
cialized NLP tools for processing bullying traces in
social media, similar to (Ritter et al., 2011; Liu et
al., 2010), to achieve better performance than mod-
els trained on formal English. In the long term, we
need to tackle the problem of piecing together the
underlying bullying episodes from fragmental bully-
ing traces. Consider two separate bullying episodes
with the following participants and roles:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.936046">
E1: B: Buffy, V: Vivian &amp; Virginia, O: Debra
E2: B: Burton, V: Buffy, O: Irene
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993302">
The corresponding bullying traces can be three posts
in this order:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.3727899">
w1 Debra: Virginia, I heard Buffy call you and
Vivian fat–ignore her!
w2 Buffy to Irene: Burton picked on me again
because I’m only 5’1
w3 Vivian: Buffy I’m notfat! Stop calling me that.
Reconstructing E1, E2 from w1, w2, w3 is challeng-
ing for a number of reasons: (1) There is no explicit
episode index in the posts. (2) Posts from a single
episode may be dispersed in time (e.g., w1, w3 be-
long to E1, but not w2), each containing only part
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.998064">
663
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944545454545">
of an episode. (3) The number of episodes and peo-
ple can grow indefinitely as more posts arrive. (4)
People may switch roles in different episodes (e.g.,
Buffy was the bully in E1 but the victim in E2). Joint
probabilistic modeling over multiple posts using so-
cial network structures hold great promise in solving
this problem.
To facilitate bullying research in the NLP com-
munity, we make our annotations and software
publicly available at http://research.cs.

<abstract confidence="0.996946416666667">We introduce the social study of bullying to the NLP community. Bullying, in both physical and cyber worlds (the latter known as cyberbullying), has been recognized as a serious national health issue among adolescents. However, previous social studies of bullying are handicapped by data scarcity, while the few computational studies narrowly restrict themselves to cyberbullying which accounts for only a small fraction of all bullying episodes. Our main contribution is to present evidence that social media, with appropriate natural language processing techniques, can be a valuable and abundant data source for the study of bullying in both worlds. We identify several key problems in using such data sources and formulate them as NLP tasks, including text classification, role labeling, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Since this is an introductory paper, we present baseline results on these tasks using off-the-shelf NLP solutions, and encourage the NLP community to contribute better models in the future.</abstract>
