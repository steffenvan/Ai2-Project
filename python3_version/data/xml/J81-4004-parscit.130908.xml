Technical Correspondence
On the Need for Parsing III-Formed Input

Kwasny and Sondheimer (1981) present techniques
for handling several types of ill-formed input within
the context of augmented transition networks. Such
approaches are necessary if natural language under-
standing systems are to handle the full range of input
to be expected from users. We present here some
statistics which illustrate the magnitude of this prob-
lem; almost one third of the queries collected in a
natural language processing experiment (McLean,
1981) contain problems of the sort they describe.
They consider three classes of ill-formed input: (1)
co-occurrence violations, (2) ellipsis and extraneous
terms, and (3) conjunction. A co-occurrence violation
results from a problem such as lack of agreement.
Ellipsis is the omission of some of the words required
for a complete sentence; this problem is grouped to-
gether with the problem of extraneous terms, in which
unnecessary words are used. The use of conjunction is
not ungrammatical, but it is included in their classifica-
tion because similar techniques can be used to handle
it.
Kwasny and Sondheimer present limited evidence
which indicates the importance of these problems.
However, different studies are cited for each of the
three problem classes, and not all of them are from the
context of natural language understanding systems.
In an experiment designed to test the influence of
experience level on the types of queries posed to a
natural language understanding system, three groups of
student subjects were asked to compose simple English
sentences requesting personnel information from a
database. Since many of the 693 queries collected
were not complete sentences in standard English, the
types of errors made were analyzed.
Co-occurrence violations were found in 12.3% of
the queries. The most common such problems were
incorrectly formed possessives and lack of agreement
between subject and verb. Extraneous terms and el-
lipsis were observed in 14.0% of the queries; the use
of ellipsis was far more common than the appearance
of extraneous terms. Conjunctions were found in
11.4% of the queries. At least one of these problems
was found in 32.8% of the queries. A more detailed
breakdown is given in the following table. (It should
be noted that these categories are not mutually exclu-
sive.)
