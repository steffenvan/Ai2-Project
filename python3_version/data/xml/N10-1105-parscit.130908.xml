In this paper, we compare two novel methods
for part of speech tagging of Arabic without
the use of gold standard word segmentation
but with the full POS tagset of the Penn Ara-
bic Treebank. The first approach uses com-
plex tags without any word segmentation, the
second approach is segmention-based, using
a machine learning segmenter. Surprisingly,
word-based POS tagging yields the best re-
sults, with a word accuracy of 94.74%.

Arabic is a morphologically rich language, in
which a word carries not only inflections but
also clitics, such as pronouns, conjunctions, and
prepositions. This morphological complexity also
has consequences for the part-of-speech (POS)
annotation of Arabic: Since words can be com-
plex, POS tags refer to segments rather than to
whole words. Thus, the word wsyrfEwnhA
(in Buckwalter transliteration; engl.: and they
will raise it) is assigned the following POS tag:

FEMININE SINGULAR] in the Penn Arabic Treebank
(ATB) (Bies and Maamouri, 2003); the boundaries
between segments are depicted by + signs. Auto-
matic approaches to POS tagging either must assign
such complex tags from a large tagset to complete
words, or they must segment the word first and
then assign POS tags to the segments. Previous
approaches (Diab et al., 2004; Habash and Rambow,
2005; van den Bosch et al., 2007; AlGahtani et al.,
2009) chose the segmentation approach but concen-
trated on POS tagging by using the segmentation
provided by the ATB. Additionally, Diab et al. and
Habash and Rambow used a reduced tagset. Diab et
al. and Habash and Rambow used Support Vector
Machines, the former with a standard windowing
approach, the latter performing a full morphological
analysis before POS tagging. Van den Bosch et
al., whose approach is the most similar to ours,
used memory-based learning with the full ATB
tagset. They report a POS tagging accuracy of
91.5% (93.3% on known words, 66.4% on unknown
words). However, they also evaluated on words
as defined in the ATB, which differs from written
Arabic in the treatment of affixes with syntactic
functions (see section 2 for details). AlGahtani et
al. used transformation-based learning combined
with a morphological analysis for unknown words
and words containing clitics. They reached a POS
tagging accuracy of 96.9% on ATB1. Surprisingly,
their results are lower for the experiment using the
whole ATB (96.1%).
In this paper, we present two methods for Ara-
bic POS tagging that do not require gold stan-
dard segmentation but can rather be used for natu-
rally occurring Arabic. We investigate two differ-
ent approaches: (1) Assigning complete POS tags
to whole words, without any segmentation, and (2)
a segmentation-based approach, for which we de-
veloped a machine learning based segmenter. In
this approach, the words are first passed to the
segmenter, then to the POS tagger. The first ap-
proach is surprisingly successful given the complex-

ity of the task, reaching an accuracy on the word
level of 94.74%, as compared to 93.47% for the
segmentation-based approach. Thus, the result for
the whole word approach is very close to the re-
sult obtained by using gold standard segmentation
(94.91%). However, a more detailed analysis shows
that this good performance of the word-based ap-
proach is due to its performance on known words
while the few unknown words are more often mis-
classified: we reach an accuracy of 96.61% on
known words but only 74.64% on unknown words.

2 Data, Methods, and Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999834195121952">
Like the previous approaches, we base our experi-
ments on the ATB, specifically on the after-treebank
POS files, for extracting our training and test sets.
More specifically, we use two sections of the ATB
(P1V3 and P3V1) since those two sets do not contain
duplicate sentences. This data set contains approxi-
mately 500,000 words. In order to be as representa-
tive of real-world Arabic, we use the non-vocalized
version of the treebank. Since previous approaches,
to our knowledge, used different data sets, our re-
sults are not directly comparable.
For both segmentation and POS tagging, we mod-
ified the ATB representation of words in order to ob-
tain the text, as it would occur in newscasts. The
ATB treats inflectional affixes, including the defi-
nite article Al, as part of a word but splits off those
affixes that serve a syntactic function into separate
words. In order to obtain text as it occurs in news-
casts, we re-attached all conjunctions, prepositions,
pronouns, and any elements that constitute parts of
the word as an orthographic unit (with the excep-
tion of punctuation) to the word. The word ltxbrh
(engl.: in order to tell him), for example, is repre-
sented as three words in the ATB, l, txbr, and
h, but is treated as one single unit in our experi-
ment. Our second modification concerns the null
element in Arabic verbs. Since Arabic is pro-drop,
the ATB annotation includes a null element in place
of the omitted subject plus the POS tag it would
receive. Since this information is not available in
naturally occurring text, we delete the null element
and its tag. For example, {i$otaraY+(null)
and its tag PV+PVSUFF SUBJ: 3MS would occur
as {i$otaraY with the tag PV in our representa-
tion (we additionally remove the short vowels).
We perform 5-fold cross validation and use the
same data split for all three types of experiments: (1)
POS tagging using gold standard segmentation taken
from the ATB, (2) POS tagging using a segmenter,
and (3) POS tagging whole words with complex
POS tags. The first experiment serves as the upper
bound and as a comparison to previous approaches.
The second experiment uses an automatic segmenter
as a pre-processing component to the POS tagger.
This means that the accuracy of the segmenter is
also the upper limit of the POS tagger since errors
in segmentation inevitably lead to errors in POS tag-
ging. The last experiment uses full words and com-
plex POS tags. The purpose of this experiment is
to determine whether it is possible to tag complete
words without segmentation.
The segmenter and the two POS taggers use
memory-based learning. For segmentation, we use
TiMBL (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005); for
POS tagging MBT, a memory-based tagger (Daele-
mans et al., 1996). Memory-based learning is a lazy
learning paradigm that does not abstract over the
training data. During classification, the k nearest
neighbors to a new example are retrieved from the
training data, and the class that was assigned to the
majority of the neighbors is assigned to the new ex-
ample. MBT uses TiMBL as classifier; it offers the
possibility to use words from both sides of the focus
word as well as previous tagging decisions and am-
bitags as features. An ambitag is a combination of
all POS tags of the ambiguity class of the word.
Word segmentation is defined as a per-letter clas-
sification task: If a character in the word constitutes
the end of a segment, its class is ’+’, otherwise ’-’.
We use a sliding window approach with 5 characters
before and 5 characters after the focus character, the
previous decisions of the classifier, and the POS tag
of the focus word assigned by the whole word tag-
ger (cf. below) as features. The best results were
obtained for all experiments with the IB1 algorithm
with similarity computed as weighted overlap, rel-
evance weights computed with gain ratio, and the
number of k nearest neighbors equal to 1.
For POS tagging, we use the full tagset, with in-
formation about every segment in the word, rather
than the reduced tagset (RTS) used by Diab et al.
and Habash and Rambow, since the RTS assumes

a segmentation of words in which syntactically rel-
evant affixes are split from the stem. The word
w+y+bHv+wn+hA, for example, in RTS is split into
3 separate tokens, w, ybHvwn, hA. Then, each of
these tokens is assigned one POS tag, Conjunction
for w, Imperfective Verb for ybHvwn, and Pronoun
for hA. The split into tokens makes a preprocessing
step necessary, and it also affects evaluation since
a word-based evaluation is based on one word, the
RTS evaluation on 3 tokens for the above example.
For all the POS tagging experiments, we use
MBT. The best results were obtained with the Modi-
fied Value Difference Metric as a distance metric and
with k = 25. For known words, we use the IGTree
algorithm and 2 words to the left, their POS tags, the
focus word and its ambitag, 1 right context word and
its ambitag as features. For unknown words, we use
IB1 as algorithm and the unknown word itself, its
first 5 and last 3 characters, 1 left context word and
its POS tag, and 1 right context word and its ambitag
tag as features.

3 Experimental Results and Discussion

3.1 Word Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999091">
The memory-based word segmentation performs
very reliably with a word accuracy of 98.23%. This
also means that when the segmentation module is
used as a pre-processing step for POS tagging, the
accuracy of the tagger will have this accuracy as its
upper bound. While there are cases where wrong
segmentation results in the same number of seg-
ments, all of these words were assigned the wrong
POS tags in our data. In an error analysis, we found
that words of specific POS are more difficult to seg-
ment than others. Proper nouns constitute 33.87%
of all segmentation errors, possibly due to the fact
that many of these are either foreign names that re-
semble Arabic words (e.g. xnt, which is ambigu-
ous between the English name Kent, and the Ara-
bic verb I was), or they are ordinary nouns used as
proper nouns but with a different segmentation (e.g.
AlHyAp, engl.: the life). The POS tag with the
second highest error rate was the noun class with
30.67%.

Table 1 shows the results of the three POS tagging
experiments described above. For the segmentation-
based experiments, we report per-segment (SAR)
and per-word (WAR) accuracy. As expected, POS
tagging using gold standard segments gives the best
results: 94.91% WAR. These results are approxi-
mately 3 percent points higher than those reported
by van den Bosch et al. (2007). Although the results
are not absolutely comparable because of the dif-
ferent data sets, this experiment shows that our ap-
proach is competitive. The next experiments investi-
gate the two possibilities to perform POS tagging on
naturally occurring Arabic, i.e. when gold segmen-
tation is not available. The results of these experi-
ments show that POS tagging based on whole words
gives higher results (WAR: 94.74%) than tagging
based on automatic segmentation (WAR: 93.47%).
This result is surprising given that tagging whole
words is more difficult than assigning tags to seg-
ments, as there are 993 complex tags (22.70% of
which occur only once in the training set), versus
139 segment tags. A detailed error analysis of a pre-
vious but similar experiment can be found in Mo-
hamed and K¨ubler (2010).
We assume that these results are an artifact of the
ATB since it is based exclusively on newswire texts.
This means that there is only a limited vocabulary,
as shown by the very low rate of unknown words:
across the five folds, we calculated an average of
8.55% unknown words. In order to test our hypoth-
esis that unknown words are tagged more reliably
with a segment-based approach, we performed an
analysis on known and unknown words separately.
The results of this analysis are shown in Table 2.
This analysis shows that for all experiments, the
unknown words are tagged with a considerably

lower accuracy. However, the loss of performance
is more pronounced in the approaches without gold
segmentation. It is also evident that tagging whole
words reaches a higher accuracy than segment-based
tagging for both known words and unknown words.
From these results, we can conclude that while seg-
mentation makes properties of the words available,
it is not required for POS tagging. We also inves-
tigated the poor performance of the segmentation-
based tagger. A closer look at the results for un-
known words in segmentation-based tagging shows
that 59.68% of the tagging errors are direct results
from incorrect segmentation decisions. In compari-
son, for known words, only 6.24% of the incorrectly
tagged words are also ill-segmented. This means
that even though the quality of the segmenter is very
high, the errors still harm the POS tagging step.
To make our results more comparable to those by
Habash and Rambow (2005), we converted the test
set with the POS tags from the whole word tagger
to their tokenization and to a reduced tagset of 15
tags. In this setting, we reach a tokenization ac-
curacy of 99.36% and a POS tagging accuracy of
96.41%. This is very close to the results by Habash
and Rambow so that we conclude that high accu-
racy POS tagging for Arabic is possible without a
full morphological analysis.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963590909091">
We have presented a method for POS tagging for
Arabic that does not assume gold segmentation,
which would be unrealistic for naturally occurring
Arabic. The approach we developed is competi-
tive although it uses the full POS tagset, without
any previous morphological analysis. The results
of our experiments suggest that segmentation is not
required for POS tagging. On the contrary, using
whole words as basis for POS tagging yields higher
accuracy, thus rendering a full morphological anal-
ysis or segmentation unnecessary. We reached the
best results in tagging whole words both for known
words and unknown words. These results were only
marginally worse that the results obtained by the ex-
periment based on gold segmentation.
The weakness of the segmentation-based ap-
proach is its low accuracy on unknown words. In the
future, we will investigate knowledge-richer meth-
ods for segmentation. In particular, we will inves-
tigate whether an automatic vocalization step previ-
ous to segmentation will improve POS tagging ac-
curacy for unknown words.

Automatic approaches to POS tagging either must assign such complex tags from a large tagset to complete words, or they must segment the word first and then assign POS tags to the segments. Previous approaches (Diab et al., 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2005; van den Bosch et al., 2007; AlGahtani et al., 2009) chose the segmentation approach but concentrated on POS tagging by using the segmentation provided by the ATB. Additionally, Diab et al. and Habash and Rambow used a reduced tagset. Diab et al. and Habash and Rambow used Support Vector Machines, the former with a standard windowing approach, the latter performing a full morphological analysis before POS tagging.

We also investigated the poor performance of the segmentationbased tagger. A closer look at the results for unknown words in segmentation-based tagging shows that 59.68% of the tagging errors are direct results from incorrect segmentation decisions. In comparison, for known words, only 6.24% of the incorrectly tagged words are also ill-segmented. This means that even though the quality of the segmenter is very high, the errors still harm the POS tagging step. To make our results more comparable to those by Habash and Rambow (2005), we converted the test set with the POS tags from the whole word tagger to their tokenization and to a reduced tagset of 15 tags. In this setting, we reach a tokenization accuracy of 99.36% and a POS tagging accuracy of 96.41%. This is very close to the results by Habash and Rambow so that we conclude that high accuracy POS tagging for Arabic is possible without a full morphological analysis. 4 Conclusions and Future Work We have presented a method for POS tagging for Arabic that does not assume gold segmentation, which would be unrealistic for naturally occurring Arabic. The approach we deve</context>
