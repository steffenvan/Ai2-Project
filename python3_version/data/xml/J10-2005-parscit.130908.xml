The past decade has seen a steady growth of interest in statistical language models for
information retrieval, and much research work has been conducted on this subject. This
book by ChengXiang Zhai summarizes most of this research. It opens with an introduc-
tion covering the basic concepts of information retrieval and statistical language models,
presenting the intuitions behind these concepts. This introduction is then followed by a
chapter providing an overview of:

• classical information retrieval models, from similarity-based models to
probabilistic relevance and inference models, and
• two retrieval frameworks, the axiomatic and decision-theoretic retrieval
frameworks, both co-developed by the author.

<bodyText confidence="0.995485194444444">
This overview covers the main aspects of these models and frameworks, and allows
the author to introduce notions that help position the statistical language model to be
presented in the following chapters.
The remainder of the book is then devoted to the presentation of the statistical
language models used in information retrieval, and their application to special tasks.
Chapter 3 presents the standard, simple query likelihood retrieval model. After review-
ing the basic idea behind this model (at the core of current statistical language models
for information retrieval), the author presents the different event models that have been
considered: Multinomial, Multiple Bernoulli, and Multiple Poisson. He then explains
the strategy for parameter estimation and the different smoothing techniques one can
rely on. This presentation is followed by a discussion of the relation between smoothing
and tf-idf weighting, which paves the way for the two-stage smoothing method pre-
sented in the following section. This chapter is very well written and presents, in a clear
yet complete way, the fundamentals of the query likelihood retrieval model.
The following chapter, entitled Complex Query Likelihood Retrieval Model, is de-
voted to extensions of the simple query likelihood model of Chapter 3. In particular, the
author reviews document-specific smoothing methods, based on document clustering
and document expansion, the use of n-gram models and Markov random fields, as well
as the full Bayesian query likelihood and the translation models. The intent here is not
to provide a detailed description of these elements, but rather to give an overview, and
pointers to extensions and models related to the query likelihood retrieval model.
Computational Linguistics Volume 36, Number 2
A major conceptual drawback of the query likelihood retrieval model lies in the
fact that feedback cannot be naturally accommodated. Indeed, in this model, a query
is seen as a sample from the document model; adding terms according to a completely
different process renders the “sample view” inadequate. In order to better accommodate
feedback, the Kullback–Leibler divergence retrieval model has been introduced. In this
model, a query model (associated with a word probability distribution) and a docu-
ment model (also associated with a word probability distribution) are compared with
the Kullback–Leibler divergence, a form of probabilistic distance. Chapter 5, entitled
Probabilistic Distance Retrieval Model, is devoted to the presentation of this model,
with a complete description of how to estimate query models and how to account
for feedback (positive and negative). This chapter is slightly more technical than the
previous ones. It, however, provides a very accurate and complete description of the
Kullback–Leibler model—currently the most widely used statistical language model in
information retrieval.
The next two chapters (Chapters 6 and 7) cover the application of these models
to special aspects of the retrieval process. In Chapter 6, the author briefly reviews
several retrieval tasks: cross-lingual information retrieval, distributed information re-
trieval, structured document retrieval, personalized and context-sensitive search, expert
finding, passage retrieval, and sub-topic retrieval. Although some tasks are reasonably
well covered (e.g., cross-lingual information retrieval), others are less detailed (e.g.,
distributed information retrieval), the author only providing a brief synthesis of the
research conducted about the use of language models. The last chapter of the book,
Chapter 7, entitled Language Models for Latent Topic Analysis, presents two widely
used topic models, namely PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) and LDA
(Latent Dirichlet Allocation), and their application to information retrieval. The presen-
tation of both PLSA and LDA is clear and precise. A section devoted to the extensions of
these models furthermore provides a lot of pointers to related studies. Although topic
models fit within the general definition adopted here for language models (probability
distribution over word sequences, page 6), their goal radically differs from that of the
statistical models presented in the previous chapters, so that choosing to devote a
chapter to topic models may seem surprising at first. The importance of topic models
and their use in various places of the retrieval process, however, justifies this choice.
A conclusion summarizing the position of statistical language models with respect
to traditional information retrieval models, and synthesizing the research progress on
statistical language models over the last decade, closes the book.
Because of the focus of the book on theoretical developments and models, it def-
initely targets researchers and Ph.D. students in information retrieval who already
possess some understanding of probability theory and statistical language models.
Teachers may use it for a course on information retrieval, but only as a complement to
general information retrieval books. Although most statistical approaches to informa-
tion retrieval are mentioned in this book, one may regret the relatively poor treatment
of the Divergence from Randomness (DFR) approach (Amati and Van Rijsbergen 2002).
This approach has been shown to yield state-of-the-art results on several collections and
could have been covered in more detail in Chapter 2 (Overview of Information Retrieval
Models), all the more so since a formal relation between statistical language and DFR
models was recently established (Clinchart and Gaussier 2009).
In conclusion, this book presents statistical language models for information re-
trieval in a thorough and clear manner. All the aspects of such models are very well
presented and all the subtleties fully addressed. Furthermore, each chapter contains
many pointers to related research, as well as a summary synthesizing the main results

presented. The part on the application to special tasks (Chapters 6 and 7) is not covered
as deeply as the other parts, but does provide useful information and pointers. All in all,
this is a very interesting book, both clear and complete, and written by a researcher who
has been an important contributor to the field. Indeed, a substantial part of the material
presented in the book was in fact developed or co-developed by the author himself.
