ORTAX deals with all the main syntactic categories and
treats them in a non-syncategorematic manner, which
treatment is not entirely assumed by PTQ. Consequently,
Hausser notes himself that any extension of his grammat-
ical model must be done via transformations in the lexi-
con (the set of all molecules).
I have tried here to give a rapid overview of SCG and
it would be necessary to go into the details of Hausser&apos;s
presentation to estimate its consistency. It cannot be
done here, but., as a conclusion, I shall give my own eval-
uation according to the two following criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.976216666666667">
• the adequacy of the model for Hausser&apos;s own objec-
tives,
• its relevance for computational linguistics.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989433761904762">
To take the first point, I have not been convinced that
Hausser&apos;s model is a strictly surface compositional gram-
mar. In my opinion, dummy elements, which are here
molecules without any surface realization, are by defi-
nition incompatible with a strict surface compositionality.
These elements are present in Generative Transforma-
tional Grammar and even in PTQ (introduced, notably,
by the non-context-free rules). Of course, the use of
such artifacts seems to be justified in the context of
formal linguistics, but they are in contradiction with the
adoption of a principle of strict surface compositionality
of meaning if they have an associated semantic represen-
tation. And computational linguistics? One could evade
the question by saying that, if formal model like PTQ
have any computational interest, so has SCG. What is
interesting is that Hausser tries to treat some important
aspects of language frequently ignored. SCG gives some
solution to the following problems which are particularly
relevant to computational linguistics (automatic trans-
lation, automatic text processing, man-machine dialog,
etc.):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998249333333333">
• What should be the description of peculiar structures
such as ellipsis?2
• How to use the information given by punctuation
marks (or intonation)?
• How to deal with morphology within a formal semantic
framework?
• How to build a general coherent system which would
be modular enough to allow easy improvements and
adaptations?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998566444444445">
This last point is particularly important and, in fact,
Hausser&apos;s book could be seen as the explanation of a
general algorithm for treating natural language. Such an
algorithm can give interesting insights and, like PTQ,
inspire some researchers in the field of computational
linguistics.
To conclude this presentation, it is important to note
that Hausser&apos;s style is clear and very &amp;quot;pedagogical&amp;quot;. He
tries to explain every detail of his model progressively
(even if, sometimes, the exposition of problems is a little
bit reductive). Obviously, this book is suited best for
logicians interested in studying a syntactic-semantic
model for natural language. The description of ORTAX
and of its connections with other syntactic models is
particularly clear and precise. The one of intensional
logic? It is absolutely hermetic for uninitiated readers.
They should, at least, try Dowty et al. (1981) or an
equivalent presentation.

1In SCG, as in PTQ, the translation process is the general mechanism
that associates at least one semantic representation in intensional logic
to each grammatical sentence, or piece of sentence.

The major emphasis in this book seems to be on the role
of linguistic theory and behavior in leading to an under-
standing of human cognition. The book is divided into
three sections which present different perspectives on the
problem within the disciplines of linguistics, psychology,
and artificial intelligence.
Rather than approaching an integration of perspec-
tives, the book leaves one with a feeling that they are still
very distant. Although the issues raised in the introduc-
tion are discussed by the authors of each paper, there is
no attempt to integrate the discussion. Instead, I felt that
each paper presented a &amp;quot;different side of the problem&amp;quot;
and that several of the authors were taking issue about
problems which were more specific to their discipline and
not immediate to the issues raised.
Overall, there are several relevant discussions of
language and mental process. However, while the
discussions border on integrated processing, the presen-
tations and information processing models described are

all sequential or serial order. They all presuppose a rule-
based system that can be enumerated in a &amp;quot;decidable&amp;quot;
sense and that includes hierarchical enumeration during
rule-application. Even the discussion of the computa-
tional approach presented by Schank and Birnbaum
includes nuances of this.
There are relevant discussions of how one can acquire
language and how it might map the real world into a
&amp;quot;usable&amp;quot; representation that permits variability. Howev-
er, these are presented at a theoretical level. There is not
sufficient material included to &amp;quot;make the theory
computational&amp;quot;. It is very interesting to note that the
processor, meaning the human brain, can constrain how
the real world projects into a subjective perceptual world,
and to provide discussion of same, but the issues of how
such a processor might control such a happening are
avoided. In contrast, for artificial intelligence, determin-
ing the process and the control presents the greatest
problem.
The psychological perspective provides a brief histor-
ical introduction to the issues considered important by
psychologists with respect to the language problem.
Many of the concerns regarding the function of repres-
entations, and the relationship between theoretical and
applied work and psycholinguistics are similar to those
expressed by the computational discussions. However,
the stress on evaluation of theories which is of utmost
importance to psychological approaches does not appear
of such concern in Al.
One area which the psychological discussion merely
touches has to do with CONTROL of the processes.
While control is mentioned, no suggestions as to how it
should become a viable part of language process or theo-
ry from a psychological perspective are presented.
Instead, all of the theories presuppose a sequential proc-
ess, at least as they are presented in the included papers.
No CONTROL alternatives are discussed, as if the prob-
lem is already solved.
One other psychological paper discusses whether there
are language-specific tasks, i.e., tasks that cannot be
&amp;quot;learned&amp;quot; or performed unless one has language. While
the issues raised are interesting, the presentation and
discussion of the evidence is far from convincing.
Perhaps it is available elsewhere, but certainly is just
touched upon here.
Finally, the discussion within the computational
approaches to language is not anything that has not been
presented many times before. Basically, two viewpoints
are presented, one the semantically driven approach to
language processing and the other which demonstrates
that there are critical aspects of language understanding
that can only be syntactically determined
The arguments presented in Marcus&apos;s paper advocat-
ing a separate role for syntactic processing were the most
clearly described in the book. If anyone is seeking exam-
ple inputs which require syntactic decision processes that
cannot be handled entirely within semantic processing, or
cannot even be recognized as a problem if one is doing

strictly semantic processing, this paper includes several.
They are all discussed from a linguistic standpoint and
not a performance one, even though there is performance
evidence to support a distinct role for syntax in process-
ing. (Cf. the vast literature of neurolinguistics on aphasic
language problems as well as evidence discussed with
respect to children with language impairments.)
After finishing this book, I felt that I had re-read a
discussion of many issues which were first being
addressed in the early attempts to define cognitive
science. They are still undecided, but there presently are
more cohesive approaches being undertaken. While each
paper presents discussion of important cognitive science
issues, given the title of the book I had hoped there
would be a more integrated discussion of how these
issues might be resolved.
The book is useful as a reference for anyone seeking
an introduction to the magnitude of problems within
cognitive science. It also provides some historical
perspectives which are not explicitly documented else-
where. But, it does not reflect any more recent attempts
to integrate the viewpoints expressed that are the focus
of research in many schools of cognitive science, where
the integration, the shared discussions of the problems,
the common approaches are underway.

The book appears to be concerned with three major
points. First, the reader can find a brief outline of the
state of the art in many fields of Artificial Intelligence:
natural language parsing, question-answering, question-
ing and summarizing of texts, paraphrasing and translat-
ing into different languages, and finally a survey on
knowledge systems. Therefore the book is extremely
useful to those who wish to know what has been done or
can be done in Al. Secondly, it is also conceived as an
introduction to procedural logic and how to apply it to
the analysis of natural language and to the various
performances listed above. Hence, the book is also
important for those who want to achieve this specific
programming competence.
The third point (which, however, is not explicitly
declared by the author) has to do with the way natural
language and the human cognitive system must be
approached. Obviously, the approach described in the
book is a procedural one; i.e., the author describes algo-
rithms for performing various cognitive tasks, such as
understanding natural language, producing natural
