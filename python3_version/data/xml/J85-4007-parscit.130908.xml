ACL85 Meeting Report
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998767083333333">
Bill Mann, Program Committee Chair, reported on
special features of the program. The Committee was
divided into two Panels, one devoted to theory, the other
to applications. A deliberate attempt was made to
encourage more submissions in the latter category, but
they were not forthcoming. Forty of the 61 papers
submitted were accepted. A tutorial program was intro-
duced for the first time at a regular ACL meeting (one
had been held at the Conference on Applied Natural
Language Processing in 1983, and COLING84 had a
&amp;quot;mini-summer school&amp;quot; during the week preceding that
conference). The exhibits program was larger and more
extensive than the one at COLING84, with a number of
demonstrations from university and industry groups.
[NOTE: The final attendance figures show that 363
people registered for the meeting. The 332 page
proceedings is available from the ACL office at $15 for
members, $20 for nonmembers. The tutorials also
proved to be quite successful: 83 attended the Parser
tutorial by Jonathan Slocum; 62 were at Prolog by
Fernando Pereira; 16 at Speech by Beatrice Oshika and
Jared Bernstein; 58 at Interfaces by Norman Sondheimer
and Madeleine Bates; and 112 at Unification by Stuart
Shieber.]

Secretary-Treasurer&apos;s Report
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963352941177">
Don Walker reported that income for the year 1984
exceeded expenditures by almost $50,000 ($178,579
against $129,080), resulting in accumulated assets of
$153,927 for the period. Some progress has been made
toward setting up cost centers, but it is still not possible
to allocate expenses accurately. With that qualification,
proceedings sales and conference income help offset loss-
es to the membership account. However, the largest
source of income is the distribution of surplus from the
National Computer Conference by AFIPS, an amount
almost equal to the ACL surplus. Preliminary figures for
the first half of 1985 show an even greater surplus, but
relatively few expenses have been incurred yet for the
year. The total number of personal members at the end
of the year was 1355, down slightly from 1983. Institu-
tional membership was up slightly, to 325. A new
membership drive under the direction of Alan Biermann

<abstract confidence="0.9269145625">presided. ACL85 Meeting Report Bill Mann, Program Committee Chair, reported on special features of the program. The Committee was divided into two Panels, one devoted to theory, the other to applications. A deliberate attempt was made to encourage more submissions in the latter category, but they were not forthcoming. Forty of the 61 papers submitted were accepted. A tutorial program was introduced for the first time at a regular ACL meeting (one had been held at the Conference on Applied Natural Processing in 1983, and a &amp;quot;mini-summer school&amp;quot; during the week preceding that conference). The exhibits program was larger and more extensive than the one at COLING84, with a number of demonstrations from university and industry groups.</abstract>

The 332 proceedings is available from the ACL office at $15 for members, $20 for nonmembers. The tutorials also proved to be quite successful: 83 attended the Parser tutorial by Jonathan Slocum; 62 were at Prolog by Fernando Pereira; 16 at Speech by Beatrice Oshika and Jared Bernstein; 58 at Interfaces by Norman Sondheimer and Madeleine Bates; and 112 at Unification by Stuart Shieber.] Secretary-Treasurer&apos;s Report Don Walker reported that income for the year 1984 exceeded expenditures by almost $50,000 ($178,579</note>

Some progress has been made toward setting up cost centers, but it is still not possible to allocate expenses accurately. With that qualification, proceedings sales and conference income help offset losses to the membership account. However, the largest source of income is the distribution of surplus from the Computer Conference by amount equal to the Preliminary figures for the first half of 1985 show an even greater surplus, but relatively few expenses have been incurred yet for the year. The total number of personal members at the end of the year was 1355, down slightly from 1983. Institutional membership was up slightly, to 325.
