The goal of this tutorial is to introduce and discuss VerbNet, a broad coverage verb lexicon
freely available on-line. VerbNet contains explicit syntactic and semantic information for classes
of verbs and has mappings to several other widely-used lexical resources, including WordNet,
PropBank, and FrameNet. Since its first release in 2005 VerbNet is being used by a large
number of researchers as a means of characterizing verbs and verb classes.
The first part of the tutorial will include an overview of the original Levin verb classification;
introduce the main VerbNet components, such as thematic roles and syntactic and semantic
representations, and present a comparison with other available lexical resources.
During the second part of the tutorial, we will explore VerbNet extensions (how new classes
were derived and created through manual and semi-automatic processes), and we will present
on-going work on automatic acquisition of Levin-style classes in corpora. The latter is useful for
domain-adaptation and tuning of VerbNet for real-world applications which require this.
The last part of the tutorial will be devoted to discussing the current status of VerbNet;
including recent work mapping to other lexical resources, such as PropBank, FrameNet,
WordNet, OntoNotes sense groupings, and the Omega ontology. We will also present changes
designed to regularize the syntactic frames and to make the naming conventions more
transparent and user friendly. Finally, we will describe some applications in which VerbNet has
been used.

Karin Kipper Schuler received her PhD from the Computer Science Department of the
University of Pennsylvania. Her primary research is aimed at the development and
evaluation of large-scale computational lexical resources. During the past couple of
years she worked for the Mayo Clinic where she was involved in applications related to
bio/medical informatics including automatic extraction of named entities and relations
from clinical data and development of knowledge models to guide this data extraction.

Anna Korhonen received her PhD from the Computer Laboratory of the University of
Cambridge in the UK. Her research focuses mainly on automatic acquisition of lexical
information from texts. She has developed techniques and tools for automatic lexical
acquisition for English and other languages, and has used them to acquire large lexical
resources , extend manually built resources, and help NLP application tasks (e.g. parsing,
word sense disambiguation, information extraction) . She has applied the techniques to
different domains (e.g. biomedical) and has also used them to advance on research in
related fields (e.g. cognitive sciences).
Susan Brown

Susan Brown is currently a PhD student in Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the
University of Colorado under Dr. Martha Palmer’s supervision. Susan’s research focuses
on lexical ambiguity, especially as it pertains to natural language processing tasks. Her
research methodologies include psycholinguistic experimentation, corpus study, and
annotation analysis. She has also been involved in the development of large-scale
lexical resources and the design and construction of a lexically based ontology.
