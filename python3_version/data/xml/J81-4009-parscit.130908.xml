Readable Dictionaries. Machine readable dictionaries
are already being used as a basis for simple text-
handling tasks like spelling correction, hyphenation,
and automatic generation of simple business letters.
More complex dictionaries are being designed for nat-
ural language processing systems capable of under-
standing and generating sophisticated texts. This ses-
sion describes current applications in office automa-
tion, research in lexical semantics, and our visions of
the dictionary of the future.
The session was organized by Martha Evens, Illi-
nois Institute of Technology, and will be chaired by her.
It will consist of:

Natural Language Help Systems. Intelligent help
facilities can contribute significantly to the usability of
sophisticated interactive systems. To handle the wide
variety of queries that will&apos; be posed to such a system,
a flexible interface is necessary. Since English pro-
vides such flexibility and is already familiar to users, it
is attractive as an interface language. This session will
explore issues in both the design of flexible help sys-
tems and the use of English for communicating with
such systems.
The session was organized by Elaine Rich, Universi-
ty of Texas at Austin, and will be chaired by Robert
Fenchel, Xerox Corporation. It will consist of:

Call for Papers - Applied Natural
Language Processing Conference
A Conference on Applied Natural Language Proc-
essing will be held February 1-3, 1983, in Santa Moni-
ca, California, sponsored by the Association for Com-
putational Linguistics and the Naval Research Labora-
tory. This special conference will focus on the use of
computational linguistic techniques in solving real
world problems, and will be limited to 300 partici-
pants. Original papers on the use of computational
linguistic techniques are being solicited in the areas of:

<listItem confidence="0.99484725">
• data, information and knowledge management
• training and education
• language translation technology
• speech recognition and synthesis technology
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9205095">
The papers should discuss applications, evaluations,
limitations, and general tools and techniques. Papers
describing end-users&apos; experience with these technolo-
gies are especially welcome.
Six copies of an extended summary of five to eight
pages, double spaced, should be sent by August 15,
1982 to:
Beatrice Oshika MD 72-27

It is important that the summary identify distinctive
aspects of the work and clearly indicate to what extent
the work is complete and has been implemented.
Summaries will be reviewed by the Conference
Committee. Notification of acceptance of papers will
be sent by September 15, 1982. For inclusion in the
Conference Proceedings, final versions of papers must
be received by November 15, 1982. Authors of ac-
cepted papers will be expected to sign a copyright
release form. Limited travel funds for authors will be
available.
Facilities for product and system demonstrations
will be available, including videotape equipment.
Short papers describing planned demonstrations and
types of equipment required should be submitted by
November 15, 1982. Additionally, tutorials and panel
sessions are planned.
