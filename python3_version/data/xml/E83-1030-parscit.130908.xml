from one of our dialogues
ABSTRACT
In the project &amp;quot;Procedural Dialogue
Models&amp;quot; being carried on at the University
of Bielefeld we have developed an incre-
mental multilevel parsing formalism to
reconstruct task-oriented dialogues. A
major difficulty we have had to overcome
is that the dialogues are real ones with
numerous ungrammatical utterances. The
approach we have devised to cope with this
problem is reported here.

FORMALISM

In recent NLU-systems a major impor-
tance is laid on processing nonstandard
input.!) The present paper reports on the
experiences we have made in the project
&amp;quot;Procedural Dialogue Models&amp;quot; reconstruc-
ting task-oriented dialogues, which were
uttered in a rather colloquial German.2)
To this aim we have developed an incre-
mental multilevel parsing formalism (Chri-
staller/Metzing 82, Gehrke 82, Gehrke 83),
based on an extension of the concept of
cascaded ATNs (Woods 80). This formalism
(see fig. A) organizes the interaction of
several independent processing components,
in our case 5. The processing components
need not be ATNs; it is up to the user of
the formalism to choose the tool for the
specific task that suits her/him best.
* The project is funded by the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft.

The first level, an ATN, is responsible
for the syntactic analysis. Its main pur4
pose is to detect phrases as well as wh4
and imperative structures and to determine
the syntactic status a phrase may have in
the utterance. On this level the analysis
of an utterance can reach a permissible
final state even if there is no complete
sentence structure derived. The decision,
if permissible or not, is made on the
pragmatic level.
The semantic interpretation is carried
Out by a case-oriented production rule
&apos;system. According to the incremental man-
ner of procesSing there are two defini4
tions of case slots:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9981446">
1. a general one for a tentative categori-
zation of phrases before the main verb
is detected, and
2. a specific one, connected with the
respective verb frame.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999105434782608">
This double definition of case slots en-
ables the parsing formalism to make a
minimal interpretation of parts of the
utterance in the case of a missing verb
and thus gives suggestions for filling
this gap.
The QUESTION...ANSWER-INTERACTION-compo-
nent is an ATN. It has to categorize an
utterance as a question, a part of an
answer or as communication maintaining
categories_ such as assurance, confirmation
etc. This component is also responsible
for recognizing a dialogue within in a
dialogue when e.g. some clarification on
that dialogue takes place.
Finally the TASK-COMMUNICATION-compo-
nent is itself a two-level cascade. One
stage, the TASK-INTERACTION-component,
provides the formalism with a dialogue
scheme that presumably is applicable to
most types of information-giving dialo-
gues. The other stage, the TASK-SPECIFICA-
TION-component, is responsible for the

route description or place description. We
divided this component into two stages
which are both realized as ATNs,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.854991">
1. in order to have a greater modulariza-
tion between different components (pro-
cessing other types of task-oriented
dialogues may require only to change
the TASK-SPECIFICATION-component on the
pragmatic level.), and
2. because each level contributes one
category to the utterance or a part of
it, which avoids double categorizations
at one level.

The pragmatic components are supported
by knowledge sources (KS) that hold for
each participant about his knowledge of
the world, the partner and the course of
the dialogue dependent of the task. The
processing components exchange their re-
sults via a common KS (a kind of a black-
board). Only control information is trans-
mitted by the cascade. The parsing forma-
lism is written in MacLISP and in FLAVORS
(diPrimio/Christaller 83) - an object-
oriented language embedded in MacLISP.
II The Dialogue Corpus
The dialogues that we are dealing with
are real task-oriented dialogues. The
majority of utterances in these dialogues
contain non-standard constructions or are
in some sense incomplete. There are dia-,
lect words, word duplications, self-cor-
rections and interjections. On the other
hand they do not contain complicated sen-
tence structures such as subordinations,
complex noun-phrases, etc. The translation
of one of our dialogues (see fig. B) may
give a little impression of these non-
standard features.
An extreme approach to the solution of
the problem of non-standard utterances
would be, in our case, to take the dialo-
gues in the corpus as they are as stark.
dard. But this would only be an ad hoc
solution, lacking generality. Thus we
burden the pragmatic components with the
decision whether an utterance is accept-
able or not.

III HANDLING OF NON-STANDARDS ON THE
WORD LEVEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.939931826086956">
Dialect words are handled as words of
the standard speech, i.e. they occur in
the lexicon. Duplication of words is re-
cognized during the read process, where4e
actual word is compared with its predeces-
sor. If they are identical and if they
belong only to one syntactic category,
then the next word is processed directly.
Otherwise a flag is set, stating that
there is possibly a duplication of words
to analyse. Such words are analysed as
usual, but the syntactic category of the
predecessing word may not be used. This
condition may cause a new problem, namely
X: Could You please tell me, how I can come to the old opera? to
Y: What?
X: the old opera to the old opera; straight ahead, yes. Come on, I show
Y: right there
ahead to the Kaufhof. To the

when a participial construction occurs
within a noun-phrase, e.g. &amp;quot;die die Stras-
se ueberquerende Frau&amp;quot;. Comparable to this
problem are constructions in English that
begin with &amp;quot;that that ...&amp;quot;. Luckily such
constructions do not occur in our corpus ,
but this prob-lem has to be kept in mind.
If the analysis runs into an error, then
the status quo ante is reestablished and
the actual word is discarded as a duplica-
tion.
Cases of self-,correction on the word
level, when a word is replaced by another
word of the same syntactic category or the
same word with an altered inflection, are
recognized during the read process as
well. They can be treated in a similar way
with the difference being, that the pre-
ceeding word is discarded and the diffe-,
ring features of the actual word are taken
- but no rules are without exceptions. The
rare case of two suceeding nouns, e.g. in
proper names (names of streets or buil-
dings) is captured in the lexicon, while
groups of prepositions or adverbs are
permissible.

IV HANDLING OF INCOMPLETE UTTERANCES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930256410256">
To handle utterances that are in some
sense incomplete we have the great advan4
tage that they have been uttered in a
specific context. A linguistic analysis of
the dialogues shows furtheron that some
types of answers, especially route des*
criptions und partial goal determinations,
have a preference for being elliptificat-
ed. In the cases mentioned the degree of
elliptification ranges from omitting the
facultative SOURCE case slot to omitting
the AGENT case slot up to uttering only a
GOAL case slot.
Due to the incremental manner oE par.
sing, as soon as a partial analysis of an
utterance is obtained the SEMANTIC-compo*
nent is triggered. There a phrase is ten-
tatively categorized, depending on case
markers (ending, preposition); auxiliary
verbs mark tense or mood, etc. Some deic-
tic adverbs such as &amp;quot;hier&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;here&amp;quot;) could
act as a SOURCE case slot for MOVE-verbs.
Categorized phrases are sent to the QUEST-
ION-ANSWER-INTERACTION-component.
When the end of an utterance is recog*
nized (sentence markers; colons can act as
end markers too), then the SEMANTIC-compo-
nent tests for completion. If a main verb
and/or a obligatory case slot is missing,
then a procedure is triggered to fill this
gap. This inference procedure firft in-
spects the actual states of the pragmatic
components to gather information as to
which categories they expect next and
wether the partial analysis fits into the
requirements of the respective category.
This information is then used by various
inference rules to fix the missing verb or
case slot.

<listItem confidence="0.909432666666667">
Let us consider some examples:
1. &amp;quot;vor bis zum Kaufhof.&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;ahead to the
Kaufhof&amp;quot;)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969707409090909">
Expectations of the pragmatic compo-
nents:
QUESTION-ANSWER-
INTERACTION-comp.: answer
TASK-INTERACTION4
comp.: an act of
information-giving
TASK-,SPECIFICATION*
comp.: route-,place description,
partial goal determination,
goal declaration
SEMANTIC*comp.: &amp;quot;zum Kaufhof&amp;quot; is cate4
gorized as a GOAL case slot.
The categories goal declaration and
place description can be discarded,
because their requirements are not
matched. Since an explicit goal (buil*
ding, street connection etc.) is utter-
ed the requirements of partial goal
determination are fulfilled first. This
category requires a verb of the field
MOVE, e.g. &amp;quot;gehen&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;to go&amp;quot;). The GOAL
case slot matches one of the require-
ments of the verb, but an AGENT is
still missing. Since the utterance is
part of a dialogue and it is directed
from the person, who is asked to give
a direction, to that person, who had
asked for the direction, a reference to
the last person, &amp;quot;sie&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;you&amp;quot;), is
taken as AGENT.
2. &amp;quot;gradaus durch die Fressgass&amp;quot;
(&amp;quot;straight on through the Fressgass&apos;&amp;quot;)
The expectations on the pragmatic com-
ponents are the same as above. &amp;quot;durch
die Fressgass&amp;quot; is categorized as a
PATH case slot. In this case a route
description is proved first and again a
MOVE-verb is taken as a candidate for
the verb. The PATH case slot matches
with its requirements and the adverb
&amp;quot;gradaus&amp;quot; is a possible description of
the way of MOVing. The AGENT case slot
is found as above.

3. At last a very funny example. One of
our dialogues starts with the following
sequence:
X: to the old opera?
Y: Yes?
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.997698">
186
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997244791666667">
Here Y must have recognized, presumably
by eye contact, that X wants to get
into contact with him. X&apos;s answer,
itself a question, is quite unpolite
but understandable. Syntactically this
utterance is an elliptical question
(voice rising, when uttered) and on the
semantic stage it can be categorized as
a GOAL case slot, depending on &amp;quot;zur&amp;quot;
and the fact that the NP refers to a
building. Since it is at the beginning
of a task.oriented dialogue with no
task fixed until now, it is categorized
as a &amp;nth:chop, specipcailen. A complete ver-
sion of this utterance may be
&amp;quot;How can. I get to the old opera?&amp;quot;
Another possible interpretation may be
that X only wants to be confirmed in
her/his assumption that he/she is on
the right way to his goal. In this case
a correct answer would have been simply
&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. But a decision which interpreta-
tion holds true can not be made with
the available information.

V Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896">
It has been shown how some types of
ill.formed input are handled, especially
with the help of semantic constraints and
pragmatic considerations. At present, our
work in this field is laid on handling
self.corrections above the word level, as
you will find one in line 5 of the sample
translation.

The parsing formalism is written in MacLISP and in FLAVORS 83) an oriented language embedded in MacLISP. II The Dialogue Corpus The dialogues that we are dealing with are real task-oriented dialogues. The majority of utterances in these dialogues contain non-standard constructions or are some sense incomplete. There are lect words, word duplications, self-corrections and interjections. On the other hand they do not contain complicated sentence structures such as subordinations, complex noun-phrases, etc. The translation of one of our dialogues (see fig. B) may give a little impression of these nonstandard features. An extreme approach to the solution of the problem of non-standard utterances would be, in our case, to take the dialogues in the corpus as they are as stark. dard. But this would only be an ad hoc solution, lacking generality. Thus we burden the pragmatic components with the decision whether an utterance is acceptable or not. III HANDLING OF NON-STANDARDS ON THE WORD LEVEL Dialect words are handled as words of the standard speech, i.e. they occur in the lexicon. Duplication of words is reduring the read process, actual word is compared with its predecessor. If they are identical and if they belong only to one syntactic category, then the next word is processed directly. Otherwise a flag is set, stating that there is possibly a duplication of words to analyse. Such words are analysed as usual, but the syntactic category of the predecessing word may not be used.

Y: Yes? 186 Here Y must have recognized, presumably by eye contact, that X wants to get into contact with him. X&apos;s answer, itself a question, is quite unpolite but understandable. Syntactically this utterance is an elliptical question (voice rising, when uttered) and on the semantic stage it can be categorized as a GOAL case slot, depending on &amp;quot;zur&amp;quot; the fact that the NP a building. Since it is at the beginning of a task.oriented dialogue with no task fixed until now, it is categorized a specipcailen.A complete version of this utterance may be &amp;quot;How can. I get to the old opera?&amp;quot; Another possible interpretation may be that X only wants to be confirmed in her/his assumption that he/she is on the right way to his goal. In this case a correct answer would have been simply &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. But a decision which interpretation holds true can not be made with the available information. V Conclusion It has been shown how some types of ill.formed input are handled, especially with the help of semantic constraints and pragmatic considerations. At present, our work in this field is laid on handling self.corrections above the word level, as you will find one in line 5 of the sample translation. Acknowlegdements I would like to thank D. Metzing, T. Christaller and B. Terwey without whose cooperation this work would not have been possible.</abstract>
