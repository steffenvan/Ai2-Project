Text and Corpus Analysis appears in Blackwell&apos;s Language in Society series and is proba-
bly better characterized by its subtitle (Computer-Assisted Studies of Language and Culture)
than by its title. Engaging in critical linguistics, Stubbs analyzes several independent
texts and makes comparisons with some findings of well-known corpora. Critical lin-
guistics is the enterprise whereby the politics and social values implicit in a text are
uncovered by close linguistic analysis and made explicit. The central aim of the book
under review is to demonstrate that some very simple tools of corpus linguistics can
be enlisted in the analysis of ideology in language.
A major premise of the book and of critical linguistics more generally is this:
&amp;quot;Grammar is choice. Different choices produce different meanings. The political na-
ture of such choices is evident when analysis is applied to texts which represent rela-
tions between groups of people&amp;quot; (p. 98). In other words, &amp;quot;all linguistic usage encodes
representations of the world. It is always possible to talk about the same thing in dif-
ferent ways, and the systematic usage of different syntactic patterns encodes different
points of view&amp;quot; (p. 130). Stubbs lays out a basis for that premise by sketching the
neo-Firthian view of language as articulated particularly in the sociolinguistics work
of M.A.K. Halliday and the corpus linguistics work of John Sinclair. Stubbs also relates
his analysis to a broader sociological analysis through the work of Anthony Giddens.
To exemplify critical linguistics, Stubbs analyzes five main texts that range in size
from a few hundred to tens of thousands of words (the former as in Baden-Powell&apos;s
farewell letters to the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts and the latter as in two secondary-
school textbooks, the larger of which contains 80,000 words). For comparisons with
his findings in these texts, as well as for pertinent examples of support and contrast
throughout the book, and for exploring significant collocational patterns, he exploits
particularly the one-million-word LOB and a 130-million-word British subcorpus of
The Bank of English.
The principal computational tool that Stubbs uses in analyzing texts and their
cultural and social values is the simple concordance. He exploits it, for example, to
identify collocational patterns for what Raymond Williams calls keywords and Firth
called focal or pivotal words—e.g., standards, discipline, fundamentals, basics, common sense,
literary heritage, nation, and proper education (p. 159). The conclusion Stubbs draws from
his analyses: &amp;quot;fixed and semi-fixed expressions (collocations, catch phrases, clichés and
idioms) encode cultural information. Such recurrent phrases, which derive partly from
works of literature and cultural history, are one of the ways in which experience is

represented and transmitted. The study of recurrent wordings is therefore of central
importance in the study of language and ideology, and can provide empirical evidence
of how the culture is expressed in lexical patterns&amp;quot; (p. 169).
At various points in Text and Corpus Analysis, Stubbs stresses that the principal
object of linguistic analysis ought to be texts rather than sentences; this principle is
important to him in the same way that he insists on the importance of naturally occur-
ring linguistic data rather than intuitions. But his tools of analysis lead him at times to
focus on sentences rather than whole texts, and his analyses sometimes suggest that
he has equated a text with the sum of its sentences. For example, he draws inferences
about the assignment of agency and responsibility by calculating frequency of pas-
sive voice verbs and nominalizations. In one analysis of a newspaper text reporting
violence in South Africa, Stubbs concludes: &amp;quot;The violence is made more abstract and
less brutal by the grammatical choices which are made. There is a connection between
the grammar used and the perspectives adopted&amp;quot; (p. 96). Elsewhere he calculates fre-
quencies of passive verbs, transitive and intransitive verbs, and inanimate subjects in
order to gauge the degree of unexpressed agency in texts. Such equations may not be
as straightforward as the analysis occasionally seems to suggest, however. While the
equation may be justified in the analysis of a particular feature in a particular text, it
is not justified in principle. Nor will selective exemplification of the equation be suffi-
cient to demonstrate its consistent or systematic interpretation. Moreover, the Whorfian
overtones of such analysis need special handling if they are not to be dismissed as
impossible to disprove.
I would not quarrel with the basic premises of critical linguistics or the likelihood
that Stubbs&apos;s methods of analysis of texts will often be perceptive and accurate. Rather,
I would note, for example, that the interaction of active and passive voice verbs can
also serve to create coherence in a text and reflect the application of sound principles
of information flow. To examine texts without acknowledging multiple functions for
particular linguistic features and to give the appearance of examining a set of sentences
rather than a coherent text is to risk a charge of tunnel vision. With its melding of
linguistics, literary analysis, and sociology, critical linguistics is in a position to help
foster more sophisticated approaches to language analysis than are current in schools
and the press, but that achievement will be frustrated if the enterprise can be brushed
aside as myopic.
Text and Corpus Analysis may have limited appeal for those readers of this jour-
nal who are interested primarily in techniques of computational linguistics. Indeed,
the few computational tools used by Stubbs are straightforward and widely available,
and some chapters report no computational findings but simply rely on corpora to
provide attested examples of the linguistic phenomena discussed. Rather, the book
excels at illustrating how students and scholars might tackle the analysis of cultural,
sociological, and political values in texts, using techniques of grammatical analysis
and computational linguistics. Computational linguists should be aware of this book
and refer students of sociology, politics, literature, and culture to it for exemplification
of just what a computational linguistics approach can and cannot reveal. It should be
noted that in this particular case, as in critical linguistics generally, the exemplifica-
tions do not fall along a wide range of the political or social spectrum. Stubbs is not
merely illustrating—he is also arguing—and his arguments are distinctly egalitarian
and progressive.
