Now in its tenth year, Neural Computation has established
itself as the leading journal for a growing community of
scientists interested in exploring the computational principles
that make brains tick. Carefully reviewed by a distinguished
editorial board, Neural Computation publishes short
communications, long articles and timely reviews on the
interplay between experimental data, computational models,
and theoretical analysis at all levels of organization in the brain,
from the molecular to the systems levels.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.6750264">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.956884">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: ,
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993331470588235">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
forty double-spaced, pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically;
consult http:/ /www.cs.columbia.edu/—radev/acl/subrnit.txt for instructions and pointers to
the LATEX style files. The submission of ah article to CL for refereeing means that the author
certifies the manuscript is not Copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publica-
tion to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a
non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on- issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Squibs and Discussions: This category includes short articles reporting technical results, dis-
cussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest to the
journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should
in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (LATEX source, postscript or plain

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing,
and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.

The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission. Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: , category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced, pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electronically; consult http:/ /www.cs.columbia.edu/—radev/acl/subrnit.txt for instructions and pointers to LATEX style files. The submission of ah article to CL for refereeing means author certifies the manuscript is not Copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. to the Editor: category includes statements of opinion issues relevant to the readership.

<abstract confidence="0.893797571428571">Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was in 1982. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings (annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, and Very Large Corpora have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
