Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9992756">
In this paper, we demonstrate three NLP
applications of the BioLexicon, which is a
lexical resource tailored to the biology
domain. The applications consist of a
dictionary-based POS tagger, a syntactic
parser, and query processing for biomedical
information retrieval. Biological
terminology is a major barrier to the
accurate processing of literature within
biology domain. In order to address this
problem, we have constructed the
BioLexicon using both manual and semi-
automatic methods. We demonstrate the
utility of the biology-oriented lexicon
within three separate NLP applications.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819954545455">
Processing of biomedical text can frequently be
problematic, due to the huge number of technical
terms and idiosyncratic usages of those terms.
Sometimes, general English words are used in
different ways or with different meanings in
biology literature.
There are a number of linguistic resources
that can be use to improve the quality of
biological text processing. WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998) and the NLP Specialist Lexicon 1 are
dictionaries commonly used within biomedical
NLP.
WordNet is a general English thesaurus which
additionally covers biological terms. However,
since WordNet is not targeted at the biology
domain, many biological terms and derivational
relations are missing.
The Specialist Lexicon is a syntactic lexicon
of biomedical and general English words,
providing linguistic information about individual
vocabulary items (Browne et al., 2003). Whilst
it contains a large number of biomedical terms,
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.882509">

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984669">
its focus is on medical terms. Therefore some
biology-specific terms, e.g., molecular biology
terms, are not the main target of the lexicon.
In response to this, we have constructed the
BioLexicon (Sasaki et al., 2008), a lexical
resource tailored to the biology domain. We will
demonstrate three applications of the BioLexicon,
in order to illustrate the utility of the lexicon
within the biomedical NLP field.
The three applications are:

In this section, we provide a summary of the
BioLexicon (Sasaki et al., 2008). It contains
words belonging to four part-of-speech
categories: verb, noun, adjective, and adverb.
Quochi et al.(2008) designed the database
model of the BioLexicon which follows the
Lexical Markup Framework (Francopoulo et al.,

The BioLexicon accommodates both general
English words and terminologies. Biomedical
terms were gathered from existing biomedical
databases. Detailed information regarding the
sources of biomedical terms can be found in
(Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2008). The lexicon

2.2. Comparison to existing lexicons
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984780952381">
This section focuses on the words and
derivational relations of words that are covered
by our BioLexicon but not by comparable
existing resources. Figures 1 and 2 show the
percentage of the terminological words and
derivational relations (such as the word
retroregulate and the derivational relation
retroregulate → retroregulation) in our lexicon
that are also found in WorNet and the Specialist
Lexicion.
Since WordNet is not targeted at the biology
domain, many biological terms and derivational
relations are not included.
Because the Specialist Lexicon is a
biomedical lexicon and the target is broader than
our lexicon, some biology-oriented words and
relations are missing. For example, the
Specialist Lexicon includes the term retro-
regulator but not retro-regulate. This means that
derivational relations of retro-regulate are not
covered by the Specialist Lexicon.

<bodyText confidence="0.9983455">
Dictionary-based POS tagging is advantageous
when a sentence contains technical terms that
conflict with general English words. If the POS
tags are decided without considering possible
occurrences of biomedical terms, then POS
errors could arise.
For example, in the protein name &amp;quot;met proto-
oncogene precursor&amp;quot;, met might be incorrectly
recognized as a verb by a non dictionary-based
tagger.

In the dictionary, biomedical terms are given
POS tag &amp;quot;NN-BIOMED&amp;quot;. Given a sentence, the
dictionary-based POS tagger works as follows.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999661571428571">
• Find all word sequences that match the
lexical entries, and create a token graph (i.e.,
trellis) according to the word order.
• Estimate the score of every path using the
weights of the nodes and edges, through
training using Conditional Random Fields.
• Select the best path.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98305775">
Figure 3 shows an example of our dictionary-
based POS tagger BLTagger.
Suppose that the input is &amp;quot;IL-2-mediated
activation of&apos;. A trellis is created based on the
lexical entries in the dictionary. The selection
criteria for the best path are determined by the
CRF tagging model trained on the Genia corpus
(Kim et al., 2003). In this example,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9934865">
IL-2/NN-BIOMED -/- mediated/VVN
activation/NN of/IN
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9067088">
is selected as the best path.
Following Kudo et al. (2004), we adapted the
core engine of the CRF-based morphological
analyzer, MeCab2, to our POS tagging task.
The features used were:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999734833333333">
• POS
• BIOMED
• POS—BIOMED
• bigram of adjacent POS
• bigram of adjacent BIOMED
• bigram of adjacent POS-BIOMED
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99809775">
During the construction of the trellis, white
space is considered as the delimiter unless
otherwise stated within dictionary entries. This
means that unknown tokens are character
sequences without spaces.
As the BioLexicon associates biomedical
semantic IDs with terms, the BLTagger attaches
semantic IDs to the tokenizing/tagging results.

4. Application 2: Enju full parser with the
BioLexicon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.550534">
Enju (Miyao, et al., 2003) is an HPSG parser,
which is tuned to the biomedical domain.
Sentences are parsed based on the output of the

<bodyText confidence="0.999519619047619">
Stepp POS tagger, which is also tuned to the
biomedical domain.
To further tune Enju to the biology domain,
(especially molecular biology), we have
modified Enju to parse sentences based on the
output of the BLTagger.
As the BioLexicon contains many multi-word
biological terms, the modified version of Enju
parses token sequences in which some of the
tokens are multi-word expressions. This is
effective when very long technical terms (e.g.,
more than 20 words) are present in a sentence.
To use the dictionary-based tagging for
parsing, unknown words should be avoided as
much as possible. In order to address this issue,
we added entries in WordNet and the Specialist
Lexicion to the dictionary of BLTagger.
The enhancement in the performance of Enju
based on these changes is still under evaluation.
However, we demonstrate a functional, modified
version of Enju.

5. Application 3: Query processing for IR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934142857143">
It is sometimes the case that queries for
biomedical IR systems contain long technical
terms that should be handled as single multi-
word expressions.
We have applied BLTagger to the TREC 2007
Genomics Track data (Hersh et al., 2007). The
goal of the TREC Genomics Track 2007 was to
generate a ranked list of passages for 36 queries
that relate to biological events and processes.
Firstly, we processed the documents with a
conventional tokenizer and standard stop-word
remover, and then created an index containing
the words in the documents. Queries are
processed with the BLTagger and multi-word
expressions are used as phrase queries. Passages
are ranked with Okapi BM25 (Robertson et al.,
1995).
Table 1 shows the preliminary Mean Average
Precision (MAP) scores of applying the
BLTagger to the TREC data set.
By adding biology multi-word expressions
identified by the BLTagger to query terms (row
(a)), we were able to obtain a slightly better
Passage2 score. As the BLTagger outputs
semantic IDs which are defined in the
BioLexicon, we tried to use these semantic IDs
for query expansion (rows (b) and (d)). However,
the MAP scores degraded.

In order to address this issue, we added entries in WordNet and the Specialist Lexicion to the dictionary of BLTagger. The enhancement in the performance of Enju based on these changes is still under evaluation. However, we demonstrate a functional, modified version of Enju. 5. Application 3: Query processing for IR It is sometimes the case that queries for biomedical IR systems contain long technical terms that should be handled as single multiword expressions. We have applied BLTagger to the TREC 2007 Genomics Track data (Hersh et al., 2007). The goal of the TREC Genomics Track 2007 was to generate a ranked list of passages for 36 queries that relate to biological events and processes. Firstly, we processed the documents with a conventional tokenizer and standard stop-word remover, and then created an index containing the words in the documents. Queries are processed with the BLTagger and multi-word expressions are used as phrase queries. Passages are ranked with Okapi BM25 (Robertson et al., 1995). Table 1 shows the preliminary Mean Average Precision (MAP) scores of applying the BLTagger to the TREC data set. By adding biology m</context>

Figure 3 shows an example of our dictionarybased POS tagger BLTagger. Suppose that the input is &amp;quot;IL-2-mediated activation of&apos;. A trellis is created based on the lexical entries in the dictionary. The selection criteria for the best path are determined by the CRF tagging model trained on the Genia corpus (Kim et al., 2003). In this example, IL-2/NN-BIOMED -/- mediated/VVN activation/NN of/IN is selected as the best path. Following Kudo et al. (2004), we adapted the core engine of the CRF-based morphological analyzer, MeCab2, to our POS tagging task. The features used were: • POS • BIOMED • POS—BIOMED • bigram of adjacent POS • bigram of adjacent BIOMED • bigram of adjacent POS-BIOMED During the construction of the trellis, white space is considered as the delimiter unless otherwise stated within dictionary entries. This means that unknown tokens are character sequences without spaces. As the BioLexicon associat</context>

By adding biology multi-word expressions identified by the BLTagger to query terms (row (a)), we were able to obtain a slightly better Passage2 score. As the BLTagger outputs semantic IDs which are defined in the BioLexicon, we tried to use these semantic IDs for query expansion (rows (b) and (d)). However, the MAP scores degraded. 63 Table 1 Preliminary MAP scores for TREC Genomics Track 2007 data Query expansion method Passage2 MAP Aspect MAP Document MAP (a) BioLexicon terms 0.</context>

However, since WordNet is not targeted at the biology domain, many biological terms and derivational relations are missing. The Specialist Lexicon is a syntactic lexicon of biomedical and general English words, providing linguistic information about individual vocabulary items (Browne et al., 2003). Whilst it contains a large number of biomedical terms, 1 http://SPECIALIST.nlm.hih.gov its focus is on medical terms. Therefore some biology-specific terms, e.g., molecular biology terms, are not the main target of the lexicon. In response to this, we have constructed the BioLexicon (Sasaki et al., 2008), a lexical resource tailored to the biology domain. We will demonstrate three applications of the BioLexicon, in order to illustrate the utility of the lexicon within the biomedical NLP field. The three applications are: • BLTagger: a dictionary-based POS tagger based on the BioLexicon • Enju full parser enriched by the BioLexicon • Lexicon-based query processing for information retrieval 2. Summary o f the BioLexicon In this section, we provide a summary of the BioLexicon (Sasaki et al., 2008). It contains words belonging to four part-of-speech categories: verb, noun, adjective, and adverb. </context>
