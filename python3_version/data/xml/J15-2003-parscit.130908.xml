Entailment rules between predicates are fundamental to many semantic-inference applications.
Consequently, learning such rules has been an active field of research in recent years. Methods
for learning entailment rules between predicates that take into account dependencies between
different rules (e.g., entailment is a transitive relation) have been shown to improve rule quality,
but suffer from scalability issues, that is, the number of predicates handled is often quite small.
In this article, we present methods for learning transitive graphs that contain tens of thousands
of nodes, where nodes represent predicates and edges correspond to entailment rules (termed
entailment graphs). Our methods are able to scale to a large number of predicates by exploiting
structural properties of entailment graphs such as the fact that they exhibit a “tree-like” property.
We apply our methods on two data sets and demonstrate that our methods find high-quality
solutions faster than methods proposed in the past, and moreover our methods for the first time
scale to large graphs containing 20,000 nodes and more than 100,000 edges.

paradigm for textual inference is Textual Entailment (Dagan et al. 2013). In textual en-
tailment, the goal is to recognize, given two text fragments termed text and hypothesis,
whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text. For example, the text Cyprus
was invaded by the Ottoman Empire in 1571 implies the hypothesis The Ottomans attacked
Cyprus.
Semantic inference applications such as QA and IE crucially rely on entailment
rules (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002; Shinyama and Sekine 2006; Berant and Liang 2014)
or equivalently, inference rules—that is, rules that describe a directional inference rela-
tion between two fragments of text. An important type of entailment rule specifies the
entailment relation between natural language predicates, for example, the entailment
rule X invade Y=&gt;X attack Y can be helpful in inferring the aforementioned hypothesis.
Consequently, substantial effort has been made to learn such rules (Lin and Pantel 2001;
Sekine 2005; Szpektor and Dagan 2008; Schoenmackers et al. 2010; Melamud et al. 2013).
Textual entailment is inherently a transitive relation, that is, the rules x =&gt; y and y =&gt;
z imply the rule x =&gt; z. For example, from the rules X reduce nausea =&gt; X help with nausea
and X help with nausea =&gt; X associated with nausea we can infer the rule X reduce nausea =&gt;
X associated with nausea (Figure 1). Accordingly, Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012)
proposed taking advantage of transitivity to improve learning of entailment rules. They
modeled learning entailment rules as a graph optimization problem, where nodes are
predicates and edges represent entailment rules that respect transitivity. To solve this
optimization problem, they formulated it as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and used
an off-the-shelf ILP solver to find an exact solution. Indeed, they showed that applying
global transitivity constraints results in more accurate graphs (known as entailment
graphs) than methods that ignore the property of transitivity.
Although using an off-the-shelf ILP solver is straightforward, finding the optimal
set of edges respecting transitivity is NP-hard, and practically, transitivity constraints
impose substantial restrictions on the scalability of the methods. In fact, in some cases
finding the optimal set of edges for entailment graphs with even —50 nodes was quite
slow.
In this article, we develop algorithms for learning entailment graphs that take
advantage of structural properties such as transitivity, but substantially reduce the com-
putational cost of inference, thus allowing us to solve the aforementioned optimization
problem on very large graphs.

Our method contains two main steps. The first step is based on a sparsity assump-
tion that even if an entailment graph contains many predicates, most of them do not
entail one another, and thus we can decompose the graph into smaller components that
can be solved more efficiently. For example, the predicates X parent of Y, X child of Y
and X relative of Y are independent from the predicates X works with Y, X boss of Y, and
X manages Y, and thus we can consider each one of these two sets separately. We prove
that finding the optimal solution for each of the smaller components results in a global
optimal solution for our optimization problem.
The second step proposes a polynomial heuristic approximation algorithm for find-
ing a transitive set of edges in each one of the smaller components. It is based on a novel
modeling assumption that entailment graphs exhibit a “tree-like” property, which we
term forest reducible. For example, the graph in Figure 1 is not a tree, because the
predicates X related to nausea and X associated with nausea form a cycle. However, these
two predicates are synonymous, and if they were merged into a single node, then the
graph would become a tree. We propose a simple iterative approximation algorithm,
where in each iteration a single node is deleted from the graph and then inserted back
in a way that improves the objective function value. We prove that if we impose a
constraint that entailment graphs must be forest reducible, then each iteration can be
performed in linear time. This results in an algorithm that can scale to entailment graphs
containing tens of thousands of nodes.
We apply our algorithm on two data sets. The first data set includes medium-sized
entailment graphs where predicates are typed, that is, the arguments are restricted to
belong to a particular semantic type (for instance, Xperson parent of Yperson). We show that
using our algorithm, we can substantially improve runtime, suffering from only a slight
reduction in the quality of learned entailment graphs. The second data set includes a
much larger graph containing 20,000 untyped nodes, where applying state-of-the-art
methods that use an ILP solver is completely impossible. We run our algorithm on this
data set and demonstrate that we can learn knowledge bases with more than 100,000
entailment rules at a higher precision compared with local learning methods.
The article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we survey prior work on the
learning of entailment rules. We first focus on local methods (Section 2.1), that is,
methods that handle each pair of predicates independently of other predicates, and
then describe global methods (Section 2.2), that is, methods that take into account
multiple predicates simultaneously. Section 3 is the core of the article and describes our
main algorithmic contributions. After formalizing entailment rule learning as a graph
optimization problem, we present the two steps of our algorithm. Section 3.1 describes
the first step, in which a large entailment graph is decomposed into smaller compo-
nents. Section 3.2 describes the second step, in which we develop an efficient heuristic
approximation based on the assumption that entailment graphs are forest reducible.
Section 4 describes experiments on the first data set containing medium-sized entail-
ment graphs with typed predicates. Section 5 presents an empirical evaluation on a large
graph containing 20,000 untyped predicates. We also perform a qualitative analysis in
Section 5.4 to further elucidate the behavior of our algorithm. Section 6 concludes the
article.
This article is based on previous work (Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger 2011; Berant
et al. 2012), but expands over it in multiple directions. Empirically, we present results
on a novel data set (Section 5) that is by orders of magnitude larger than in the past.
Algorithmically, we present the Tree-Node-And-Component-Fix algorithm, which is an
extension of the Tree-Node-Fix algorithm presented in Berant et al. (2012) and achieves
best results in our experimental evaluation. Theoretically, we provide an NP-hardness

In this section we describe prior work relevant for entailment rule learning. First, we
describe local methods that estimate entailment for a pair of predicates, focusing on
methods that we employ in this article. Then, we describe global methods that perform

2.1 Local Learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861242424243">
In local learning, given a pair of predicates (i, j) we would like to determine whether
i ⇒ j. The main sources of information utilized in the past for local learning were
(1) lexicographic resources, (2) co-occurrence, and (3) distributional similarity. We
briefly describe the first two and then expand more on distributional similarity, which
is the most commonly used source of information.
Lexicographic resources are manually built knowledge bases from which semantic
information may be extracted. For example, the hyponymy, toponymy, and synonymy
relations in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) can be used to detect entailment between nouns
and verbs. Although WordNet is the most popular lexicographic resource, other re-
sources such as CatVar, Nomlex, and FrameNet have also been utilized to extract
inference rules (Meyers et al. 2004; Budanitsky and Hirst 2006; Szpektor and Dagan
2009; Coyne and Rambow 2009; Ben Aharon, Szpektor, and Dagan 2010).
Pattern-based methods attempt to identify the semantic relation between a pair of
predicates by examining their co-occurrence in a large corpus. For example, the sentence
people snore while they sleep provides evidence that snore ⇒ sleep. While most pattern-
based methods focused on identifying semantic relations between nouns (for example,
Hearst patterns [Hearst 1992]), several works (Pekar 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky
2011; Weisman et al. 2012) attempted to extract relations between predicates as well.
Chklovsky and Pantel (2004) used pattern-based methods to generate the commonly
used VerbOcean resource.
Both lexicographic as well as pattern-based methods suffer from limited cover-
age. Distributional similarity is therefore used to automatically construct broad-scale
resources. Distributional similarity methods are based on the “distributional hypoth-
esis” (Harris 1954) that semantically similar predicates occur with similar arguments.
Quite a few methods have been suggested (Lin and Pantel 2001; Szpektor et al. 2004;
Bhagat, Pantel, and Hovy 2007; Szpektor and Dagan 2008; Yates and Etzioni 2009;
Schoenmackers et al. 2010), which differ in terms of the specifics of the ways in which
predicates are represented, the features that are extracted, and the function used to
compute feature vector similarity. Next, we elaborate on the methods that we use in this
article.
Lin and Pantel (2001) proposed an algorithm for learning paraphrase relations
between binary predicates, that is, predicates with two variables such as X treat Y.
For each binary predicate, Lin and Pantel compute two sets of features Fx and Fy,

which are the words that instantiate the arguments X and Y, respectively, in a large
corpus. Given a predicate u and its feature set for the X variable Fx, every feature fx ∈ Fx
is weighted by pointwise mutual information between the predicate and the feature:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9454005">
w( fx) = log Pr( fx|u)
Pr( fx) , where the probabilities are computed using maximum likelihood
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.980907">
over the corpus. Given two predicates u and v, the Lin measure (Lin 1998) is computed
for the variable X in the following manner:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9865795">
Linx(u,v) = Ef∈Fz∩Fvx[wux( f ) + wX( f )] (1)
Ef∈Fux wux( f ) + Ef∈Fvx wvx( f )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997457">
The measure is computed analogously for the variable Y and the final distribu-
tional similarity score, termed DIRT, is the geometric average of the scores for the
two variables: If DIRT(u,v) is high, this means that the templates u and v share many
“informative” arguments and so it is possible that u ⇒ v.
Szpektor and Dagan (2008) suggested two modifications to DIRT. First, they looked
at unary predicates, that is, predicates with a single variable such as X treat. Secondly,
they computed a directional score that is more suited for capturing entailment relations
compared to the symmetric Lin score. They proposed that if for two unary predicates
u ⇒ v, then relatively many of the features of u should be covered by the features of v.
This is captured by the asymmetric Cover measure (Weeds and Weir 2003):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.971974333333333">
Ef∈Fu∩Fv wu( f )
Cover(u, v) = (2)
Ef∈Fu wu( f )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999619">
The final directional score, termed BInc (Balanced Inclusion), is the geometric average
of the Lin measure and the Cover measure.
Both Lin and Pantel as well as Szpektor and Dagan compute a similarity score using
a single argument. However, it is clear that although this alleviates sparsity problems,
considering pairs of arguments jointly provides more information. Yates and Etzioni
(2009), Schoenmackers et al. (2010), and even earlier, Szpektor et al. (2004), presented
methods that compute semantic similarity based on pairs of arguments.
A problem common to all local methods presented above is predicate ambiguity—
predicates may have different meanings and different entailment relations in different
contexts. Some works resolved the problem of ambiguity by representing predicates
with argument variables that are typed (Pantel et al. 2007; Schoenmackers et al. 2010).
For example, argument variables in the work of Schoenmackers et al. were restricted
to belong to one of 156 types, such as country or profession. A different solution that
has attracted substantial attention recently is to represent the various contexts in which
a predicate can appear in a low-dimensional latent space (for example, using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation [Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003]) and infer entailment relations between
predicates based on the contexts in which they appear (Ritter, Mausam, and Etzioni
2010; ´OS´eaghdha 2010; Dinu and Lapata 2010; Melamud et al. 2013). In the experiments
presented in this article we will use the representation of Schoenmackers et al. in one
experiment, and ignore the problem of predicate ambiguity in the other.

2.2 Global Learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973604166667">
The idea of global learning is that, by jointly learning semantic relations between a
large number of natural language phrases, one can use the dependencies between the
relations to improve accuracy. A natural way to model that is with a graph where nodes
are phrases and edges represent semantic similarity. Snow, Jurafsky, and Ng (2006)
presented one of the early examples of global learning in the context of learning noun
taxonomies. In their work, they enforced a transitivity constraint over the taxonomy
using a greedy inference procedure and demonstrated that this improves the quality of
the taxonomy. Transitivity constraints were also enforced by Yates and Etzioni (2009),
who proposed a clustering algorithm for learning undirected synonymy relations.
Nakashole, Weikum, and Suchanek (2012) learned a taxonomy of binary predicates and
also enforced transitivity with a greedy algorithm.
Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012) developed a global method for learning en-
tailment relations between predicates. In this article we present scalable approximation
algorithms for the optimization problem they propose, and so we provide further detail
on their method. The input to their algorithm is a large corpus and a lexicographic
resource, such as WordNet, and the output is a set of entailment rules that respect the
constraint of transitivity. The algorithm is composed of two main steps. In the first
step, a set of predicates is extracted from the corpus and a local entailment classifier
is trained based on examples automatically generated from the lexicographic resource.
At this point, we can derive for each pair of predicates (i, j) a score wij ∈ R that estimates
whether i ⇒ j.
In the second step of their algorithm, they construct a graph, where predicates are
nodes and edges represent entailment rules. Using the local scores they look for the set
of edges E that maximizes the objective function E(i,j)∈E wij under the constraint that
edges respect transitivity. They show that this optimization problem is NP-hard and
find an exact solution using an ILP solver over small graphs. They also avoid problems
of predicate ambiguity by partially contextualizing the predicates. In this article, we
present efficient and scalable heuristic approximation algorithms for the optimization
problem they propose.
In recent years, there has been substantial work on approximation algorithms for
global inference problems. Do and Roth (2010) suggested a method for the related task
of learning taxonomic relations between terms. Given a pair of terms, they construct a
small graph that contains the two terms and a few other related terms, and then impose
constraints on the graph structure. They construct these small graphs because their
work is geared towards scenarios where relations are determined on-the-fly for a given
pair of terms and no global knowledge base is ever explicitly constructed. Because they
independently construct a graph for each pair of terms, their method easily produces
solutions where global constraints, such as transitivity, are violated.
Another approximation method that violates transitivity constraints is LP relaxation
(Martins, Smith, and Xing 2009). In LP relaxation, binary variables are replaced by
continuous variables, transforming the problem from an ILP to a Linear Program (LP),
which is polynomial. An LP solver is then applied, and variables that are assigned a
fractional value are rounded to their nearest integer, so many violations of transitivity
may occur. The solution when applying LP relaxation is not a transitive graph; we will
show in Section 4 that our approximation method is substantially faster.
Global inference has gained popularity in recent years in NLP, and a common ap-
proximation method that has been extensively utilized is dual decomposition (Sontag,
Globerson, and Jaakkola 2011). Dual decomposition has been successfully applied in

tasks such as Information Extraction (Reichart and Barzilay 2012), Machine Translation
(Chang and Collins 2011), Parsing (Rush et al. 2012), and Named Entity Recogni-
tion (Wang, Che, and Manning 2013). To the best of our knowledge, it has not yet
been applied for the task of learning entailment relations. The graph decomposition
method we present in Section 3.1 can be viewed as an ideal case of dual decom-
position, where we can decompose the problem into disjoint components in a way
that we do not need to ensure consistency of the results obtained on each component
separately.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99627936">
Our goal is to learn a large knowledge base of entailment rules between natural
language predicates. Following Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012), we formu-
late this task as a graph-learning problem, where, given the nodes of an entailment
graph, we would like to find the best set of edges that respect a global transitivity
constraint.
Our main modeling assumption is that textual entailment is a transitive relation.
Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012) have demonstrated that this modeling assump-
tion holds for focused entailment graphs, that is, graphs in which predicates are disam-
biguated by one of their arguments. For example, a graph that focuses on the concept
nausea might contain a en entailment rule between predicates such as X prevents nausea
=&gt; X affects nausea, where the predicate X prevent Y is disambiguated by the instantiation
of the argument nausea. In this work, we will examine this modeling assumption for
more general graphs. In Section 4 we show that transitivity holds in typed entailment
graphs, that is, graphs where each predicate specifies the semantic type of its arguments
(for example, Xdrug prevent Ysymptom). In Section 5.4, we examine the assumption of
transitivity when predicates do not carry any typing information (for example, X prevent
Y); and we observe that in this setting the assumption of transitivity is often violated
because of the predicate ambiguity. Nevertheless, we show that even in this set-up we
can empirically take advantage of the transitivity assumption.
Let V be a set of predicates, which are the nodes of the entailment graph, and let
w : V x V -+ R be an entailment weighting function. Given a pair of predicates (i, j), a
positive wij indicates local tendency to decide that i entails j, whereas a negative wij
indicates local tendency to decide that i does not entail j. We want to find a global
entailment transitive graph that is most consistent with the local cues. Formally, our
goal is to find the directed graph 9 = (V, E) that maximizes the sum of edge weights

Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012) proved that this optimization problem
(which we term Max-Trans-Graph) is NP-hard, and provided an ILP formulation for
it. Let xij be an indicator for whether i =&gt; j, then x = 1xij : i =� j} are the variables of the

The objective function is the sum of weights over the edges of 9, and the constraint
xij + xjk − xik &lt; 1 on the binary variables enforces transitivity (i.e., xij = xjk = 1 implies
that xik = 1). The weighting function w is trained separately using supervised learning
methods and we describe the details of training for each one of our experiments in
Sections 4 and 5.
There is a simple probabilistic modeling that motivates the score (3) that we
optimize. Assume that for each pair of nodes (i,j), we are given a probability pij(1) =
p(xij = 1) that i =&gt; j (the probability that i =* j is denoted by pij(0) = 1 − pij(1)). Assum-
ing a uniform probability over graphs, the posterior probability (which can also be
viewed as the likelihood) of a graph, represented by an edge-set x, is:

It can be easily verified that:1
logp(xij) = log pij(1)

Hence,
logp(x) = � log p(xij) = � wijxij + const (6)

The optimal entailment graph, therefore, is arg maxx p(x) = arg maxx i�=j wijxij, where
the maximization is over all the transitive graphs. Hence the most likely transitive
entailment graph is obtained as the solution of the ILP maximization problem (3).
Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger solved this optimization problem with an ILP
solver, but because ILP is NP-hard, this does not scale well; the number of variables
is O(|V|2) and the number of constraints is O(|V|3). Thus, even a graph with 80 nodes
(predicates) has more than half a million constraints. In this section, we describe a
heuristic algorithm that empirically provides high-quality solutions for this optimiza-
tion problem in graphs with tens of thousands of nodes.
Our algorithm contains two main steps. The first step (Section 3.1) is based on
a structural assumption that entailment graphs are relatively sparse—that is, most
predicates do not entail one another. This allows us to decompose the graph into smaller
components in a way that guarantees that an exact solution for each one of the compo-
nents results in an exact solution for Max-Trans-Graph. However, often even after de-
composition, components are too large and finding an exact solution is still intractable.
The second step (Section 3.2) proposes a heuristic algorithm for finding a good
solution for each one of the components. This step is based on an observation that

of graph, which we term forest-reducible graph. We utilize this property to develop
an iterative efficient approximation algorithm for learning the graph edges, where each
iteration takes linear time. We also prove that finding the optimal forest-reducible graph
is NP-hard.
In Sections 4 and 5 we apply our algorithm on two different data sets and show
that using transitivity substantially improves performance and that our methods dra-

The first step of our algorithm takes advantage of graph sparsity: Most predicates in
language do not entail one another. Thus, it might be possible to decompose entailment
graphs into small components and solve each component separately.
Let V1, V2 be a partitioning of the nodes V into two disjoint non-empty subsets. We
term any directed edge, whose two nodes belong to different subsets, a crossing edge.

If we can partition a set of nodes V into disjoint sets V1, V2 such that no crossing edge
has a positive weight, then the optimal set of edges that is the solution of the ILP
problem (3) does not contain any crossing edge.
Proof Assume by contradiction that the edge-set of the optimal solution Eopt con-
tains a non-empty set of crossing edges Ecross. We can construct Enew = Eopt \ Ecross.
Clearly E(i,j)∈Enew wij ≥ E(i,j)∈Eopt wij, as wij ≤ 0 for any crossing edge.
Next, we show that Enew does not violate transitivity constraints. Assuming it does,
then the violation is caused by omitting the edges in Ecross. Thus, there must be, without
loss of generality, nodes i E V1 and k E V2 such that for some node j, (i, j) and ( j, k) are in
Enew, but (i, k) is not. However, this means either (i, j) or ( j, k) is a crossing edge, which
is impossible because we omitted all crossing edges. Thus, Enew is a better solution than
Eopt, contradiction. Hence, Ecross is empty. ■
This proposition suggests a simple algorithm (see Algorithm 1): Construct an
undirected graph with the node set V and with an edge connecting i and j if either
wij &gt; 0 or wji &gt; 0, then find its connected components, and finally solve each component
separately. If an ILP solver is used to find the edges of each component separately,

then we obtain an optimal (not approximate) solution to the optimization problem (3)
for the whole graph. Finding the undirected edges (Line 1) and computing connected
components (Line 2) can be performed in O(V2). Thus, in this case the efficiency of the
algorithm is dominated by the application of an ILP solver (Line 4).
If the entailment graph decomposes into small components, one could obtain an
exact solution with an ILP solver, applied on each component separately, without
resorting to any approximation. To further extend scalability in this setting we use a
cutting-plane method (Kelley 1960). Cutting-plane methods have been used in the past,
for example, in dependency parsing (Riedel and Clarke 2006). The idea is that even if
we omit all transitivity constraints, we still expect most transitivity constraints to be
satisfied, given a good weighting function w. Thus, it makes sense to avoid specifying
the constraints ahead of time, but rather add them when they are violated. This is
formalized in Algorithm 2.
Line 1 initializes an active set of constraints (ACT). Line 3 applies the ILP solver with
the active constraints. Lines 4 and 5 find the violated constraints and add them to the
active constraints. The algorithm halts when no constraints are violated. The solution
is clearly optimal because we obtain a maximal solution for a less-constrained problem
that does not violate any transitivity constraint.
A pre-condition for using cutting-plane methods is that computing the violated con-
straints (Line 4) is efficient, as it occurs in every iteration. We do that in a straightforward
manner: For all edges (i, j) and ( j, k) that are in the current solution E*, if (i, k) ∈/ E*
we add xij + xjk − xik ≤ 1 to the violated constraints. This is cubic in worst-case and
performs very fast in practice.
To conclude, an exact algorithm for Max-Trans-Graph decomposes the graph into
components and uses Algorithm 2 to find an exact solution for each component. How-
ever, because the problem is NP-hard, this will still fail once components become large.
Next, we describe the second step of our method, which replaces Algorithm 2 with an
efficient approximation that can scale to much larger graphs. We will show in Section 4
that the solutions obtained by the approximation algorithm are almost as good as the
exact solution on a data set where finding an exact solution is feasible.

The approximation we present in this section is based on a conjecture that entailment

to a directed forest, which we term forest-reducible graph (FRG). Although FRGs are
a more constrained class of directed graphs, we prove that restricting our optimization

problem to FRGs does not make the problem fundamentally easier, that is, the problem
remains NP-hard (see Appendix). Then, we present in Section 3.2.2 our iterative approx-
imation algorithm, where in each iteration a node is removed and re-attached back to
the graph in a locally optimal way. Combining this scheme with our conjecture about
the graph structure yields a linear algorithm for node re-attachment.
Thus, the contribution of this section is twofold: First, we define a novel mod-
eling assumption about the tree-like structure of entailment graphs and empirically
demonstrate its validity. Second, we exploit this assumption to develop a polynomial
approximation algorithm for learning entailment graphs that can scale to much larger
graphs than in the past.
3.2.1 Forest-Reducible Graph. The predicate entailment relation, described by our entail-
ment graphs, is typically from a “semantically specific” predicate to a more “general”
one. Thus, intuitively, the topology of an entailment graph is expected to be “tree-like.”
In this section we first formalize this intuition and then empirically analyze its validity.
This property of entailment graphs is an interesting topological observation on its own,
but also enables the efficient approximation algorithm of Section 3.2.2.
For a directed edge i ⇒ j in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we term the node i
a child of node j, and j a parent of i.2 A directed forest is a DAG where all nodes
have no more than one parent. A strongly connected component in a directed graph
is a set of nodes such that there is a path from every node in the set to any other
node. In entailment graphs, strongly connected components correspond to semantically
equivalent predicates.
The entailment graph in Figure 2a (subgraph from the data set described in
Section 4) is clearly not a directed forest—it contains a cycle of size two comprising
the nodes X common in Y and X frequent in Y, and in addition the node X be epidemic
in Y has three parents. However, we can convert it to a directed forest by applying
the following operations. Any directed graph G can be converted into a Strongly-
Connected-Component (SCC) graph in the following way: Every strongly connected
component is contracted into a single node, and an edge is added from SCC S1 to SCC
S2 if there is an edge in G from some node in S1 to some node in S2. The SCC graph is
always a DAG (Cormen et al. 2002), and if G is transitive, then the SCC graph is also
transitive. The graph in Figure 2b is the SCC graph of the one in Figure 2a, but is still
not a directed forest because the node X be epidemic in Y has two parents.
The transitive closure of a directed graph G is obtained by adding an edge from node i
to node j if there is a path in G from i to j. The transitive reduction of G is obtained by
removing all edges whose absence does not affect its transitive closure. In DAGs, the
result of transitive reduction is unique (Aho, Garey, and Ullman 1972). We thus define
the reduced graph Gred = (Vred,Ered) of a directed graph G as the transitive reduction of
its SCC graph. The graph in Figure 2c is the reduced graph of the one in Figure 2a and
is a directed forest. We say a graph is a forest-reducible graph if its reduced graph is a
directed forest.
We now hypothesize that entailment graphs are approximately FRGs. The intuition
is that the predicate on the left-hand-side of an entailment rule has a more specific
meaning than the one on the right-hand-side. For instance, in Figure 2a X be epidemic in Y
(where X is a type of disease and Y is a country) is more specific than X common in Y and

ingly, the reduced graph in Figure 2c is an FRG. We note that this is not always the case:
For example, the entailment graph in Figure 3 is not an FRG, because X annex Y entails
both Y be part of X and X invade Y, while the latter two do not entail one another. How-
ever, we hypothesize that this scenario is rather uncommon. Consequently, a natural
variant of the Max-Trans-Graph problem is to restrict the required output graph of the
optimization problem (3) to an FRG. We term this problem Max-Trans-Forest.
To test whether our hypothesis holds empirically, we performed the following anal-
ysis. We sampled seven gold standard typed entailment graphs (that is, graphs where

predicates specify the semantic type of their arguments, such as Xdrug prevents Ysymptom)
from the data set described in Section 4, manually transformed them into FRGs by
deleting a minimal number of edges, and measured recall over the set of edges in each
graph (precision is naturally 1.0, as we only delete gold-standard edges). The lowest
recall value obtained was 0.95, illustrating that deleting a very small proportion of
edges converts a typed entailment graph into an FRG. Further support for the practical
validity of this hypothesis is obtained from our experiments on typed entailment graphs
in Section 4. In these experiments we show that exactly solving Max-Trans-Graph
and Max-Trans-Forest (with an ILP solver) results in nearly identical performance. In
Section 5.4 we qualitatively analyze the validity of the FRG assumption in untyped
entailment graphs (where predicates are of the form X prevents Y) and find that this
assumption does not always hold, because of predicate ambiguity.
An ILP formulation for Max-Trans-Forest is simple—a transitive graph is an FRG
if all nodes in its reduced graph have no more than one parent. It can be verified that
this is equivalent to the following statement: For every triplet of nodes i, j, k, if i =&gt; j and
i =&gt; k, then either j =&gt; k or k =&gt; j (or both). This constraint can be stated in a linear form:
xij + xik − xjk − xkj &lt; 1. Therefore, adding this new type of constraint to the ILP given in
Equation (3) results in a formulation for Max-Trans-Forest:

<bodyText confidence="0.96772019047619">
A natural question is whether there is a simpler (polynomial) solution for Max-Trans-
Forest that avoids the need for an ILP solver. In the Appendix we prove that Max-Trans-
Forest is also an NP-hard problem by a polynomial reduction from the X3C problem
(Garey and Johnson 1979). Readers who are not interested in the proof can safely skip
the Appendix.
3.2.2 Approximation Algorithm. In this section we present Tree-Node-Fix and Tree-Node-
And-Component-Fix, which are efficient approximation algorithms for Max-Trans-
Forest, as well as Graph-Node-Fix, an approximation for Max-Trans-Graph.
Tree-Node-Fix. The scheme of Tree-Node-Fix (TNF) is the following. First, an initial FRG
is constructed, using some initialization procedure. Then, at each iteration a single node
v is re-attached (see below) to the FRG in a way that improves the objective function.
This is repeated until the value of the objective function can no longer be improved by
re-attaching a node.
Re-attaching a node v is performed by removing v from the graph (deleting v and all
its adjacent edges) and connecting it back with a better set of edges, while maintaining
the constraint that it is an FRG. This is done by considering all possible edges from/to
the other graph nodes and choosing the optimal subset, while the rest of the graph edges
remain fixed. For example, in Figure 2, one way of re-attaching the node X common in
Y is to add it as a direct child of X occur in Y that is not a synonym of X frequent in Y.
This will result in deletion of the edges X common in Y =&gt; X frequent in Y, X frequent in
Y =&gt; X common in Y, and also X be epidemic in Y =&gt; X common in Y, because otherwise the

resulting graph will not be an FRG. We will show that re-attachment can be efficiently
performed in linear time using dynamic programming.
Formally, let Sv−in = Pi6=v wivxiv be the sum of scores over v’s incoming edges
and Sv−out = Pk6=v wvkxvk be the sum of scores over v’s outgoing edges. Re-attachment
amounts to optimizing a linear objective:

<equation confidence="0.9934275">
argmax (Sv-in + Sv-out) (9)

<bodyText confidence="0.999925615384615">
while maintaining the FRG constraint, where the variables x(v) C x are indicators for all
pairs of nodes involving v. We approximate a solution for Equation (3) by iteratively
optimizing the simpler objective (9). Clearly, at each re-attachment the value of the
objective function cannot decrease, because the optimization algorithm considers the
previous graph as one of its candidate solutions.
We now show that re-attaching a node v is linear. To analyze v’s re-attachment, we
consider the structure of the directed forest 9red just before v is re-inserted, and examine
the possibilities for v’s insertion relative to that structure. We start by defining some
helpful notations. Every node c E Vred is a strongly connected component in 9. Let vc E c
be an arbitrary representative node in c (we can choose any node vc E c, because the
graph 9 is transitive, and c is a strongly connected component). We denote by Sv-in(c)
the sum of weights from all nodes in c and their descendants to v, and by Sv-out(c) the
sum of weights from v to all nodes in c and their ancestors:

Note that v cannot form a new component that contains other nodes as well, because
the rest of the graph is fixed.
To find the optimal way of re-attaching v, we need to compute the score Equa-
tion (9), for each of the three cases, and choose the best one. We now describe how
this score is computed in each of the three cases.
Case 1: Inserting v into a component c E Vred. In this case we add in 9 edges from
all nodes in c and their descendants to v and from v to all nodes in c and their ancestors.
The score (9) in this case is

<bodyText confidence="0.997547">
Case 2a: Inserting v as a child of some c E Vred. Once c is chosen as the parent of v,
choosing v’s children in 9red is substantially constrained. A node that is not a descendant
of c cannot become a child of v, because this would create a new path from that node
to c and would require by transitivity to add a corresponding directed edge to c (but all
graph edges not connecting v are fixed). Moreover, only a direct child of c can choose v as
a parent instead of c (Figure 4b), because for any other descendant of c, v would become
a second parent, and 9red will no longer be a directed forest (Figure 4b’). Thus, this case
requires adding in 9 edges from v to all nodes in c and their ancestors; additionally,
for each new child of v, denoted by d E Vred, we add edges from all nodes in d and
their descendants to v. Crucially, although the number of possible subsets of c’s children
in 9red is exponential, the fact that they are independent trees in 9red allows us to go
over them one by one, and decide for each one whether it will be a child of v or not,
depending on whether Sv-in(d) is positive. Therefore, the score (9) in this case is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9793915">
Es2(c) g Sv-out(c)+ max(0, Sv-in(d)) (13)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994996">
where child(c) are the children of c.
Case 2b: Inserting v as a new root in 9red. Similar to case 2a, only roots of 9red can
become children of v. In this case for each chosen root r we add in 9 edges from the
nodes in r and their descendants to v. Again, each root can be examined independently.
Therefore, the score (9) of re-attaching v is:

<equation confidence="0.9935825">

where p is the parent of c in 9red. These recursive definitions allow computing in linear
time Sv-in(c) and Sv-out(c) for all c (given 9red) using dynamic programming, before going
over the cases for re-attaching v. Sv-in(c) is computed going over Vred leaves-to-root
(post-order), and Sv-out(c) is computed going over Vred root-to-leaves (pre-order).
Re-attachment is summarized in Algorithm 3. Computing an SCC graph is linear
(Cormen et al. 2002), and it is easy to verify that transitive reduction in FRGs is also
linear (Line 1). Computing Sv-in(c) and Sv-out(c) (Lines 2–3) is also linear, as explained.
Cases 1 and 2b are trivially linear and in case 2a we go over the children of all nodes in
Vred. As the reduced graph is a forest, this simply means going over all nodes of Vred,
and so the entire algorithm is linear.
Because re-attachment is linear, re-attaching all nodes is quadratic. Thus if we
bound the number of iterations over all nodes, the overall complexity is quadratic. This
is dramatically more efficient and scalable than applying an ILP solver. Empirically, we
found that TNF converges after 5–10 iterations.
Tree-Node-and-Component-Fix. Assuming that entailment graphs are FRGs allows us to
use the node re-attachment operation in linear time. However, this assumption also en-
ables performing other graph operations efficiently. We now suggest a natural extension
to the TNF algorithm that better explores the space of FRGs.
A disadvantage of TNF is that it re-attaches a single node in every iteration. Con-
sider, for instance, the reduced graph in Figure 5. In this graph, nodes l, m, and n are
direct children of node k, but suppose that in the optimal solution they are all children
of node j. Reaching the optimal solution would require three independent re-attachment
operations, and it is not clear that each of the three alone would improve the objective
function value. However, if we allow re-attachment operations over components in
the SCC graph, then we would be able to re-attach the strong connectivity component
containing the nodes l, m, and n in a single operation. Thus, the idea of our extended
TNF algorithm is to allow re-attachment of both nodes and components. We term this
algorithm Tree-Node-and-Component-Fix (TNCF).
There are many ways in which this intuition can be implemented and our TNCF
algorithm uses one possible variant. In TNCF we first perform node re-attachment
until convergence as in TNF (after initialization), but then compute the SCC graph
and perform component re-attachment until convergence. Component re-attachment is
identical to node re-attachment, except that we are guaranteed that the reduced graph
is a forest. After performing component re-attachment until convergence, we again

Graph-Node-Fix. The re-attachment strategy described above can be applied without
assuming that the graph is an FRG. Next, we show Graph-Node-Fix (GNF), a similar
algorithm that uses the re-attachment strategy to obtain an approximate solution for
the ILP problem Max-Trans-Graph (3). In this more general case, finding the optimal re-
attachment of a node v is done with an ILP solver. Nevertheless, this ILP is simpler than
Equation (3), because we consider only candidate edges involving v. Figure 6 illustrates
the three types of possible transitivity constraint violations when re-attaching v. The
left side depicts a violation when (i, k) E/ E, expressed by the constraint in Equation (18),
and the middle and right depict two violations when the edge (i, k) E E, expressed by
the constraints in Equation (19). Thus, the ILP is formulated by adding the following
constraints to the objective function (9):

Complexity is exponential because of the ILP solver; however, the ILP size is
reduced by an order of magnitude to O(|V|) variables and O(|V|2) constraints. To
summarize, the complexity of GNF is higher than the complexity of TNF, but it does
not require the assumption that entailment graphs are FRGs.

4. Experimental Evaluation: Typed Entailment Graphs

In this and the next section we empirically evaluate the algorithms presented in Sec-
tion 3 on two different data sets. Our first data set, presented in this section, com-
prises medium-sized graphs for which obtaining an exact solution is possible, and we
demonstrate that our approximation methods substantially improve runtime while
causing only a small degradation in performance compared with the optimal solution.
The graphs are also particularly suited for global optimization because graph predicates
are typed, which substantially reduces their ambiguity. The second data set (Section 5)
contains a graph with tens of thousands of untyped nodes, where exact inference
is completely impossible. We show that our methods scale to this graph and that
transitivity improves performance even when predicates are untyped. The resulting
graph contains more than 100,000 entailment rules that can be utilized in downstream
semantic applications.
The input to the algorithms presented in Section 3 is a set of nodes V and a weight-
ing function w : V x V -+ R. We describe how those are constructed before presenting
an experimental evaluation.

As mentioned in Section 2, one of the challenges in global optimization is that tran-
sitivity does not always hold when predicates are ambiguous. Schoenmackers et al.
(2010) proposed an algorithm for learning inference rules between typed predicates, a
representation that substantially reduces ambiguity. We adopt their representation and
learn typed entailment graphs. A typed entailment graph (see Figure 7) is a directed
graph where the nodes are typed predicates. A typed predicate is a triple (t1, p, t2), or
simply p(t1, t2), representing a predicate in natural language. p is the lexical realization

belong to the semantic types t1, t2. Semantic types are taken from a set of types T, where
each type t E T is a bag of natural language words or phrases. Examples for typed
predicates are: conquer(COUNTRY,CITY) and contain(PRODUCT,MATERIAL). An instance
of a typed predicate is a triple (a1, p, a2), or simply p(a1, a2), where a1 E t1 and a2 E t2

common in(DISEASE,PLACE).
Given a set of typed predicates, entailment rules can only exist between predicates
that share the same (unordered) pair of types (such as PLACE and COUNTRY), as other-
wise, the rule would contain unbound variables. Hence, given a set of typed predicates
we can immediately decompose them into disjoint subsets—all typed predicates shar-
ing the same pair of types define a separate graph that describes the entailment relations
between those predicates (see Figure 7).
Edges in typed entailment graphs represent entailment rules in the usual way. If
the type t1 is different from the type t2, mapping of arguments is straightforward, as
in the rule be find in(MATERIAL,PRODUCT) ⇒ contain(PRODUCT,MATERIAL). If t1 and t2
are equal we need to specify how arguments are mapped. This is done by splitting each
node into two: For example, the node beat(TEAM,TEAM) is split into two typed predicates
beat(Xteam,Yteam) and beat(Yteam,Xteam). This allows us to specify a rule where argument
order is reversed such as beat(Xteam,Yteam) ⇒ lose to(Yteam,Xteam). This also accommodates
rules such as play(Xteam,Yteam) ⇒ play(Yteam,Xteam): If team A plays team B, then team B
plays team A.
To create typed entailment graphs, we used a data set that was generously provided
by Schoenmackers et al. (2010). Schoenmackers et al. produced a mapping of 1.1 million
arguments into 156 types (Examples for (argument, TYPE) pairs are (exodus, BOOK), (china,
COUNTRY), and (asthma, DISEASE)), and then utilized the types, the mapped arguments,
and 1 million TextRunner tuples (Banko et al. 2007) to generate a set of 10,672 typed
predicates.3 Because entailment can only occur between predicates that share the same
types, we decomposed the 10,672 typed predicates into 2,303 typed entailment graphs.
The largest graph contains 188 nodes and the total number of potential rules is 263,756.4
The advantage of typing predicates is that it substantially reduces ambiguity, while still
maintaining rules of wide applicability.

The weighting function w is derived from an entailment score provided by a local
classifier. Given a local classifier that provides an entailment score sij for a pair of pred-
icates (i, j), we define wij = sij − A, where A is a prior that controls graph sparseness: As
A increases, wij decreases and becomes negative for more pairs of predicates, rendering
the graph more sparse. The probabilistic interpretation of A is as follows. For each two
nodes let q be a prior probability that an edge exists. For large values of q the graph
tends to be dense, and vice versa. Defining A as log 1−q
q , the modified weight function is:

Training is similar to the method proposed by Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger
(2012), and we briefly describe it here. The input for training is a lexicographic resource,
for which we use WordNet, and a set of tuples, for which we use the 1 million typed
TextRunner tuples provided by Schoenmackers et al. We perform the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9966772">
1. Training set generation Positive examples are generated using WordNet
synonyms and hypernyms. Negative pairs are generated using WordNet
direct co-hyponyms (sister terms), but we also utilize Word hyponyms
at distance 2. In addition, we generate negative examples by randomly
sampling pairs of typed predicates that share the same types. Table 1
provides an example for each type of automatically generated training
example. It has been noted in the past that the WordNet verb hierarchy
contains a certain amount of noise (Richens 2008; Roth and Frank
2012). However, we use WordNet only to generate examples for training
a statistical classifier, and thus we can tolerate some noise in the generated
examples. In fact, we have noticed that simple variants in training set
generation do not result in substantial differences in classifier performance.
2. Feature representation Each example pair of typed predicates (p1,p2)
is represented by a feature vector, where each feature is a distributional
similarity score estimating whether p1 entails p2.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9815905">
We compute 11 distributional similarity scores for each pair of typed
predicates, based on their arguments in the input set of tuples. The first six
scores are computed by trying all combinations of two similarity functions
Lin and BInc with three types of feature representations (see Section 2):

feature vectors, one for the X slot and one for the Y slot. Similarities
are computed for each vector separately and are then combined
by a geometric average (as in DIRT [Lin and Pantel 2001]). For
example, the predicate invade(COUNTRY,CITY) will have a feature
vector for its X slot with features such as germany and england, and a
feature vector for its Y slot with features such as leningrad and paris.

predicate. Then, similarity scores are combined by a geometric
average. For example, the binary typed predicate invade(COUNTRY,
CITY) will be decomposed into two unary predicates, one where
the first argument of invade has the type COUNTRY (and the type of
the second argument is unspecified), and another where the second
argument of invade has the type CITY (and the first argument in
unspecified).
The other five scores were provided by Schoenmackers et al.
(Schoenmackers et al. 2010) and include SR (Schoenmackers et al. 2010),
LIME (McCreath and Sharma 1997), M-estimate (Dzeroski and Brakto 1992),
the standard G-test, and a simple implementation of Cover (Weeds and Weir
2003). Overall, the rationale behind this representation is that combining
various scores will yield a better classifier than each single measure.

3. Training We sub-sample negative examples and train over an equal
number of positive and negative examples. We used SVMperf
(Joachims 2005) to train a Gaussian kernel classifier that provides
an output score, sij. We tuned the two SVM parameters using 5-fold
cross validation on a development set of two typed entailment graphs.
4. Prior knowledge For a small number of pairs of predicates, we might have
prior knowledge of whether one entails the other. Berant, Dagan, and
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.861525888888889">
Goldberger (2012) integrated prior knowledge by adding hard constraints
to the ILP. Because not all of our algorithms use an ILP solver, we integrate
prior knowledge by modifying the local classifier score. For pairs of
predicates i, j for which we have prior knowledge that i entails j (termed
positive local constraints), we set sij = ∞. For pairs of predicates i, j for
which we have prior knowledge that i does not entail j (termed negative
local constraints), we set sij = −∞.
To generate prior knowledge constraints we normalized each predicate by
omitting the first word if it is a modal and turned passives into actives. If
two normalized predicates are equal, they are a positive local constraint.
Negative local constraints were constructed from three sources
(1) Predicates differing by a single pair of words that are WordNet
antonyms, (2) Predicates differing by a single word of negation, and (3)
Predicates p(t1, t2) and p(t2, t1) where p is a transitive verb (for example,
beat) in VerbNet (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000).
As reported by Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012), we find that
injecting prior knowledge into the graph improves performance, as it
provides a good starting point for the inference procedure.

We implemented the following algorithms for learning graph edges, where in all of
them the graph is first decomposed into components as described in Section 3.1.
No-trans Use local scores without transitivity constraints—an edge (i, j) is inserted
iff wij &gt; 0, or in other words iff sij &gt; A.
Exact-graph Find the optimal solution for Max-Trans-Graph in each component by
applying an ILP solver in a cutting-plane method, as described in Section 3.1.
Exact-forest Find the exact solution for Max-Trans-Forest (see Equation 8) in each
component by applying an ILP solver in a cutting-plane method.
LP-relax Solve Max-Trans-Graph approximately by applying an LP-relaxation (see
Section 2) on each graph component. We apply the LP solver within the same cutting-
plane method to allow for a direct comparison. As mentioned, our goal is to present a
method for learning transitive graphs, whereas LP-relax produces solutions that violate
transitivity. However, we run it on our data set to obtain empirical results, and to
compare runtimes against TNF.
Graph-Node-Fix (GNF) Initialize each component in the following way: If the
graph is very sparse, that is, A ≥ C for some constant C (set to 1 in our experiments),
then solving the graph exactly is not an issue and we use Exact-graph. Otherwise, we
initialize by applying Exact-graph in a sparse configuration, that is, A = C.
Tree-Node-Fix (TNF) Initialize as in GNF, except that if it generates a graph that is
not an FRG, it is corrected by a simple heuristic: For every node in the reduced graph
9red that has more than one parent, we choose from its current parents the single one
whose SCC is composed of the largest number of nodes in 9.
We do not present the results of TNCF in this experiment, because for medium-sized
graphs it provides results that are almost identical to TNF.
The No-trans baseline is a state-of-the-art local learning algorithm. It uses state-of-
the-art local scores such as DIRT (Lin and Pantel 2001), BInc (Szpektor and Dagan 2008),
Cover (Weeds and Weir 2003), and SR (Schoenmackers et al. 2010) and trains a classifier
using these scores. Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2010) have demonstrated empiri-
cially that training a classifier over multiple similarity scores improves performance
compared with using just a single similarity score.
The Exact-graph algorithm is the state-of-the-art global method presented by
Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012). It finds the optimal solution for Max-Trans-
Graph, and our goal is to show that we can obtain good performance more efficiently
using our approximation methods. Last, LP-relax is a standard approximation method
for solving ILPs (Martins, Smith, and Xing 2009).
We note that a trivial baseline would be to initialize edges based on whether sij &gt; A
and then compute the transitive closure in each component. We empirically found that
this adds edges too aggressively and results in very low precision.
We use the Gurobi optimization package5 as our ILP solver in all experiments. The
experiments were run on a multi-core 2.5GHz server with 32GB of RAM.
We evaluate algorithms by comparing the set of gold-standard edges with the set
of edges learned by each algorithm. We measure recall, precision, and F1 for various
values of the sparseness parameter A, and compute the area under the precision-recall
curve (AUC) generated. Efficiency is evaluated by comparing runtimes.
We first focus on runtimes and show that TNF is substantially more efficient than
other baselines that use transitivity. Figure 8 compares runtimes of Exact-graph, GNF,
TNF, and LP-relax as −A increases and the graph becomes denser. Note that the y-axis

is in logarithmic scale. Clearly, Exact-graph is extremely slow and runtime increases
quickly. For A = 0.3, runtime was already 12 hours and we were unable to obtain re-
sults for A &lt; 0.3, whereas in TNF we easily got a solution for any A. When A = 0.6,
where both Exact-graph and TNF achieve best F1, TNF is 10 times faster than Exact-
graph. When A = 0.5, TNF is 50 times faster than Exact-graph, and so on. Most impor-
tantly, runtime for GNF and TNF increases much more slowly than for Exact-graph.
Comparing runtimes for TNF and GNF, we see that the gap between the algorithms
decreases as −A increases. However, for reasonable values of A, TNF is about four to
seven times faster than GNF, and we were unable to run GNF on large graphs, as we
report in Section 5.
Runtime of LP-relax is also bad compared with TNF and GNF. Runtime increases
more slowly than Exact-graph, but still very fast compared with TNF. When A = 0.6,
LP-relax is almost 10 times slower than TNF, and when A = −0.1, LP-relax is 200 times
slower than TNF. This points to the difficulty of scaling LP-relax to large graphs. Last,
Exact-forest is the slowest algorithm and because it is an approximation of Exact-graph
we omit if from the figure for clarity.
We now examine the quality of the learned graphs and validity of our modeling
assumptions. Figure 9 (left) shows a pair-wise comparison of Exact-graph and Exact-
forest. As is evident, the two curves are very similar, and the maximal F1 on the
curve and AUC are almost identical. This provides further support for our modeling
assumption that entailment graphs are roughly forest-reducible. Figure 9 (right) shows
a similar comparison for TNF and GNF. We observe again that the curves are similar and
performance is almost identical (maximal F1: 0.41, AUC: 0.31), illustrating that using the
FRG assumption when using our approximation algorithm is empirically effective.
In Figure 10, we compare the performance of Exact-graph, which exactly solves
Max-Trans-Graph, to our most efficient approximation algorithm, TNF, and to No-trans,
a baseline that does not use transitivity at all (GNF and LP-relax are omitted from the

annotated for their validity by crowdsourcing. For example, the data set
marks that The exercises alleviate pain =&gt; The exercises help ease pain is a valid

increase the defense budget is an invalid rule application. We extract a single

alleviate Y =&gt; X help ease Y. We use half of the data set for training, resulting

identical to the first six features described in Section 4.2. In addition, for
pairs of predicates for which at least one distributional similarity feature is
non-zero, we add lexicographic features computed from WordNet
(Fellbaum 1998), VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel 2004), and CatVar
(Habash and Dorr 2003), as well as string-similarity features. Table 2
provides the exact details of these features. A feature is computed for a
pair of predicates (p1,p2) where in this context a predicate is a pair
(pred,rev): pred is the lexical realization of the predicate, and rev is a
Boolean indicating whether arg1 is X and arg2 is Y or vice versa. Overall,
each pair of predicates is represented by 27 features.
3. Training. After obtaining a feature representation for every pair of
predicates, we train a Gaussian kernel SVM classifier that optimizes F1

4. Prior knowledge. We automatically generate local constraints for pairs of
predicates for which we know with high certainty whether the first entails
the second or not. We define and compute constraints over pairs of
predicates (p1, p2), where again a predicate p is a pair (pred, rev). We start
with negative local constraints (Examples in Table 3):
(a) cousin: (p1, p2) are cousins if rev1 = rev2 and pred1 = pred2, except for
a single pair of words w1 and w2, which are cousins in
WordNet—that is, they have a common hypernym at distance 2.
(b) indirect hypernym: (p1,p2) are indirect hypernyms if rev1 = rev2 and
pred1 = pred2, except for a single pair of words w1 and w2, and w1 is
a hypernym at distance 2 of w2 in WordNet.

5.3 Experimental Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913707317074">
To evaluate performance we use the second half of the data set released by Zeichner,
Berant, and Dagan (2012) as a test set. This test set contains 3,283 annotated examples,
where 1,734 are covered by the 10,000 nodes of our graph (649 positive examples
and 1,085 negative examples). As usual, for each algorithm we compute recall and
precision with respect to the gold standard at various points by varying the sparseness
parameter A.
Most methods used over typed graphs in Section 4 (Exact-graph, Exact-forest, LP-
relax, and GNF) are intractable because they require an ILP solver and our graph does
not decompose into components that are small enough. Therefore, we compare the No-
trans local baseline, where transitivity is not used, with the efficient global methods
TNF and TNCF. Recall that in Section 4 we initialized TNF by applying an ILP solver
in a sparse configuration on each graph component. In this experiment the graph is too
large to use an ILP solver and so we initialize TNF and TNCF with a simple heuristic
we describe next.
We begin with an empty graph and first sort all pairs of predicates (i, j) for which
wij &gt; 0, according to their weight w. Then, we go over predicate pairs one-by-one and
perform two operations. First, we verify that inserting (i, j) into the graph does not
violate the FRG assumption. This is done by going over all edges (i, k) E E and checking
that for every k either ( j, k) E E or (k, j) E E. If this is the case, then the edge (i, j) is a valid
candidate edge as the resulting reduced graph will remain a directed forest, otherwise
adding it will result in i having two parents in the reduced graph, and we do not insert
this edge. Second, we compute the transitive closure Tij, which contains all node pairs
that must be edges in the graph in case we insert (i, j), due to transitivity. We compute
the change in the value of the objective function if we were to insert Tij into the graph.
If this change improves the objective function value, we insert Tij into the graph (and
so the value of the objective function increases monotonically). We keep going over
the candidate edges from highest score to lowest until the objective function can no
longer be improved by inserting a candidate edge. We term this initialization HTL-FRG,
because we scan edges from high-score to low-score and maintain an FRG. We add this
initialization procedure as another baseline.
Figure 11 presents the precision-recall curve of all global algorithms compared with
the local classifier for 0.05 &lt; A &lt; 2.5. One evident property is that No-trans reaches
higher recall values than the global algorithms, which means that adding a global
transitivity constraint prevents adding correct edges that have positive weight, since
this would cause the addition of many other edges that have negative weight. A possible
reason for that is predicate ambiguity, where positive weight edges connect connectivity
components through an ambiguous predicate. This suggests that a natural direction for
future research is to develop algorithms that do not impose transitivity constraints for
rules i =&gt; j and j =&gt; k, if each rule refers to a different meaning of j. One possible direction
is to learn latent “sense” or “topic” variables for each rule (as suggested by Melamud
et al. Melamud et al. [2013]). Then, we can use the methods presented in this article

to impose transitivity constraints for each sense separately, and easily allow violations
of transitivity across different senses. We provide concrete examples for such cases of
ambiguity in our qualitative analysis in Section 5.4.
Although global algorithms are limited in their recall, for recall values of 0.1–
0.2 they substantially improve precision over No-trans. To better observe this result,
Table 5 presents the results for the recall range 0.1–0.25. Comparing TNCF and No-

In the recall range of 0.1–.2, the precision of No-trans is 0.68–0.75, whereas the precision
of TNCF is 0.74–0.8. The number of rules learned by TNCF in this recall range is
about 100,000.
We use HTL-FRG as an initialization method for TNCF, which on its own is not a
very good approximation algorithm. Comparing HTL-FRG with No-trans, we observe
that it is unable to reach high recall values and it only marginally improves precision
compared with No-trans. Applying TNF over HTL-FRG also provides disappointing
results—it increases recall compared with HTL-FRG, but precision is not better than
No-trans. Indeed, it seems that although performing node re-attachments monotoni-
cally improves the objective function value, it is not powerful enough to learn a graph
that is better with respect to our gold standard. On the other hand, adding component
re-attachments (TNCF) allows the algorithm to better explore the space of graphs and
learn a graph with higher recall and precision than HTL-FRG.
Figure 12 presents the runtime for HTL-FRG, TNF, and TNCF (y-axis in loga-
rithmic scale), all of which yield an FRG and can be run on a large untyped graph.
Again, we were unable to obtain results with Exact-graph, Exact-forest, LP-relax, and
GNF, because using an ILP solver on a graph with 20,000 nodes was impossible. As
expected, HTL-FRG is much faster than both TNF and TNCF, and TNCF is somewhat
slower than TNF. However, as mentioned earlier, TNCF is able to improve both pre-
cision and recall compared with TNF and HTL-FRG. Note that when λ = 1.2, runtime
increases suddenly for both TNF and TNCF. This is because at this point a large con-
nected component is formed, as we explain next.
Figure 13 presents the results of graph decomposition as described in Section 3.1.
Evidently, when λ = 0 the largest component constitutes almost all of the graph, which
contains 20,000 nodes. Note that when λ = 1.2, the size of the largest component in-
creases suddenly to more than half of the graph nodes. Additionally, TNCF obtained
recall of 0.1–0.2 when λ ≤ 0.2, and in this case the number of nodes in the largest

graphs, untyped graphs that contain ambiguous predicates do not decompose well into
small components.
To summarize, we demonstrated that our efficient global methods scale to a graph
with 20,000 nodes and observed that even when predicates are ambiguous we are able
to improve precision for moderate values of recall. Nevertheless, there are indications
that our modeling assumptions are violated when applied over a large graph with
ambiguous predicates. Transitivity and FRG constraints limit the recall we are able to
reach, and the graph does not decompose very well into components. Thus, in future
work we would like to apply our algorithms over graphs where predicate ambiguity is
modeled and so transitivity constraints can be properly applied.

that allows us to gain better insight on the behavior of our algorithms.
Question 1: Transitivity and FRG assumptions. We would like to understand why using
global algorithms such as TNCF results in limited recall. Our hypothesis is that be-
cause predicates in the graph are untyped and potentially ambiguous, violations of the

assumptions are possible, which results in recall reduction. To examine this hypothesis,
we perform two qualitative analyses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7491708">
1. We analyze graphs containing only gold-standard edges, and manually
identify cases where the modeling assumptions are violated.
2. We compare the local algorithm, No-trans, to the global algorithm, TNCF.
If our hypothesis is correct, then we expect TNCF to remove correct edges
that are inserted by No-trans due to ambiguous predicates.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999151307692308">
We start by constructing a graph with all edges from our gold-standard data set
and search for transitivity and FRG violations caused by ambiguous predicates. Note
that the manually annotated gold-standard edges are only a subset of the full set of
correct edges, which is actually much larger. Thus, we cannot automatically identify
violations, because the graph is missing many true edges. Instead, we manually go
over candidate violations and check if indeed this case is a result of a violation of our
modeling assumptions, and if so then our global algorithm cannot predict the correct
set of edges.
One example is the pair of rules seek =&gt; apply for and apply for =&gt; file for. The first
rule was annotated in the rule application Others seek medical care =&gt; Others apply for
medical care (Recall that crowdsourcing was used to annotate rule applications, and rules
were extracted from these applications.) The second rule was extracted from the rule
application Students apply for more than one award =&gt; Student file for more than one award.
This causes a transitivity violation because Students seek more than one award ; Student
file for more than one award. Evidently, the meaning of the predicate apply for is context-
dependent. Another example is the pair of rules contain =&gt; supply and supply =&gt; serve
annotated in the applications The page contains links =&gt; The page supplies links and Users
supply information or material =&gt; Users serve information or material. Clearly, contain ; serve
and the transitivity violation is caused by the fact that the predicate supply is context-
dependent—in the first context the subject is inanimate, whereas in the second context
the subject is human.
A good example for an FRG violation is the predicate come from. The following
three entailment rules are annotated by the turkers: come from =&gt; be raised in, come
from =&gt; be derived from, and come from =&gt; come out of. These correspond to the following
rule applications: The Messiah comes from Judah =&gt; The Messiah was raised in Judah, The
colors come from the sun light =&gt; The colors are derived from the sun light, and The truth
comes from the book =&gt; The truth comes out of the book. Clearly, be raised in ; be derived
from and be derived from ; be raised in, so this is an FRG violation. Indeed, the three
applications correspond to different meanings of the predicate come from, which depend
on context. A second example is the pair of rules be dedicated to =&gt; be committed to and be
dedicated to =&gt; contain information on. Again, this is an FRG violation because be committed
to ; contain information on and contain information on ; be committed to. This violation
occurs because of the ambiguity of the predicate be dedicated to, which can be resolved
by knowing whether the subject is human or is an object that carries information (for
example, The web site is dedicated to the life of lizards).
This first analysis revealed particular cases where the transitivity and FRG as-
sumptions do not hold. In the next analysis, we would like to directly compare cases
where global and local methods disagree with one another. We hypothesize that because
predicates are not disambiguated, then global algorithms will delete correct edges due

to an ambiguous predicate. We set the sparseness parameter λ = 0.2 and compare the
set of edges learned by No-trans to the set of edges learned by TNCF.
Examining the disagreements, we observe that, as expected, in 90% of the cases
TNCF deletes an edge that was inserted by No-trans. We divide these deleted edges
into two categories in the following manner: We compute the weakly connected com-
ponents of the graph learned by TNCF,10 and then for each edge inserted by No-trans
and deleted by TNCF we check whether it connects two different weakly connected
components or not. There are two reasons for focusing on this property of deleted edges.
First, we hypothesize that most deleted edges will connect two different connected com-
ponents, because such edges result in many violations of transitivity. Second, weakly
connected components usually correspond to separate semantic meanings, and thus
a correct edge that connects two weakly connected components probably involves an
ambiguous predicate.
Indeed, out of all edges where No-trans inserts an edge and TNCF does not, 76.4%
connect weakly connected components in the global graph. This proves that deleting
such edges is the main cause for disagreement between TNCF and No-trans. Now, we
can take a closer look at these edges, and check whether indeed when a correct edge is
deleted, it is because of an ambiguous predicate.
We randomly sample five cases where TNCF erroneously deleted an edge connect-
ing weakly connected components—these are cases where ambiguity is likely to occur.
For comparison, we also sample five cases where TNCF was right and No-trans erred.
Table 6 shows the samples where No-trans is correct. The first column describes the rule
and the second column specifies the score sij provided by the local classifier No-trans.
The last two columns detail two examples for predicates that are in the same weakly
connected component with the rule LHS and RHS in the graph learned by TNCF. These
two columns provide a flavor for the overall meaning of predicates that belong to this
component. Table 7 is equivalent and shows the samples where TNCF is correct.
Example 1 in Table 6 already demonstrates the problem of ambiguity. The LHS for
this rule application in the crowdsourcing experiment was your parents turn off comments
and indeed in this case the RHS your parents cut off comments is inferred. However,
we can see that the LHS component revolves around the turning off or shutting off of
appliances, for example, whereas the RHS component deals with a more explicit and
physical meaning of cutting. This is because the predicate X cut off Y is ambiguous
and consequently TNCF omits this correct edge. Example 5 also demonstrates well the
problem of ambiguity—the LHS of this rule application is This site was put by fans, which
in this context entails the RHS This site was run by fans. However, the more common
sense of be put by does not entail the predicate be run by; this sense is captured by the
predicates in the LHS component Y help put X and X be placed by Y. Example 4 is another
good example where the ambiguous predicate is X be open to Y—the RHS component is
concerned with the physical state of being opened, whereas the LHS component has a
more abstract sense of availability. The LHS of the rule application in this case was The
services are available to museums. Examples 2 and 3 are cases where the problem is not in
predicate ambiguity but in the connected component itself. Thus, out of five randomly
sampled examples where TNCF deleted an edge that connects two weakly connected
components, three can be attributed to predicate ambiguity.

where the global constraint of transitivity helps the algorithm avoid errors. In Exam-
ple 1, although sij = 0.83 (which is higher than λ = 0.2), the edge is not inserted because
this would cause the addition of wrong edges from the LHS component that deals with
seeing and visiting to the RHS component, which is concerned with help and support.
Example 2 is a case of a pair of predicates that are co-hyponyms or even perhaps antonyms.
Transitivity helps TNCF avoid this erroneous rule.
To conclude, our analysis reveals that applying structural constraints encourages
global algorithms to omit edges. Although this is often desirable, it can also prevent cor-
rect rules from being discovered because of problems of ambiguity. Thus, as discussed
in Section 5.3, we believe that an important direction for future research is to apply our
global graph learning methods over context-sensitive representations (such as the one
presented by Melamud et al. [2013]).
Question 2: Node re-attachment. We would like to understand the effect of applying TNF
over the entailment graph, or more precisely, check whether TNF substantially alters the
set of graph edges compared with an initialization with HTL-FRG. First, we run both

HTL-FRG and TNF with sparseness parameter λ = 0.2 and compute the proportion
of edges that is in their intersection. HTL-FRG learns 48,986 edges and TNF learns
61,186 edges. The number of edges in the intersection is 35,636. This means that 27%
of the edges learned by HTL-FRG were removed (13,350 edges) and in addition 25,550
edges were added into the graph. Clearly, this indicates that TNF changes the learned
graph substantially.
We exemplify this with a few fragments of graphs learned by HTL-FRG and TNF.
Figure 14 shows 11 predicates,11 where the black solid edges correspond to HTL-FRG
edges and red dashed edges correspond to TNF edges. Nodes that contain more than a
single predicate represent an agreement between TNF and HTL-FRG that all predicates
in the node entail one another. Clearly, TNF substantially changes the initialization
generated by HTL-FRG. HTL-FRG creates an erroneous component in which give a lot
of and generate a lot of are synonymous and mean a lot of entails them. TNF disassembles
this component and determines that give a lot of is equivalent to offer plenty of, while
generate a lot of entails cause of. Moreover, TNF disconnects the predicate mean a lot of
completely. TNF also identifies that the predicates offer a wealth of, provide a wealth of,
provide a lot of, and provide plenty of entail offer plenty of. Of course, TNF sometimes causes
errors—for example, HTL-FRG decided that cause and cause of are equivalent, but TNF
deleted the correct entailment rule cause of ⇒ cause.
Figure 15 provides another interesting example for an improvement in the graph
due to the application of TNF. In the initialization, HTL-FRG determined that the
predicate encrypt entails the predicates convert and convince rather than the predicates
code and encode. This is because the local score provided by the classifier for (encrypt,
convert) is 0.997—slightly higher than the local score for (encrypt, encode), which is 0.995.
Therefore, HTL-FRG inserts the wrong edge encrypt ⇒ convert and then it is unable to
insert the correct rule encrypt ⇒ encode because of the FRG assumption. After HTL-FRG
terminates, TNF goes over the nodes one by one and is able to determine that overall
the predicate encrypt fits better as a synonym of the predicates code and encode and re-
attaches it in the correct location. As an aside, notice that both HTL-FRG and TNF are
able to identify in this case the correct directionality of the rule compress ⇒ encode. The

(encode, compress) is –0.11.
As a last example, Figure 16 demonstrates again the problem of predicate ambi-
guity. The predicate depress can occur in two contexts that, though related, instigate
different entailment relations. The first context is when the object of the predicate (the
Y argument) is a person and then the meaning of depress is similar to discourage. A
second context is when the object is some phenomenon, for example, The serious economical
situation depresses consumption levels. In initialization, HTL-FRG generates a set of edges
that is compatible with the latter context, determining that the predicate depress entails
the predicates lower and bring down. TNF re-attaches depress as a synonym of discourage
and deter (because this improves the objective function), resulting in a set of edges
that corresponds to the first meaning of depress mentioned above. The methods we
use in this article do not allow learning the rules for both contexts because this would
result in violations of the transitivity and FRG assumptions. This again emphasizes the
importance of learning graphs where predicates are marked by their various senses,
which will result in a model that can directly benefit from the methods suggested in
this article.

The problem of language variability is at the heart of many semantic applications such
as Information Extraction, Question Answering, Semantic Parsing, and more. Conse-
quently, learning broad coverage knowledge bases of entailment rules and paraphrases
(Ganitkevitch, Van Durme, and Callison-Burch 2013) has proved crucial for systems
that perform inference over textual representations (Stern and Dagan 2012; Angeli and
Manning 2014).

In this article, we have presented algorithms for learning entailment rules between
predicates that can scale to large sets of predicates. Our work builds on prior work by
Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012), who defined the concept of entailment graphs,
and formulated entailment rule learning as a graph optimization problem, where the
graph has to obey the structural constraint of transitivity.
Our main contribution is a heuristic polynomial approximation algorithm that can
learn entailment graphs containing tens of thousands of nodes. The algorithm is based
on two main observations: first, that entailment graphs are sparse, and second, that
entailment graphs are forest-reducible. This leads to an efficient algorithm in which at
the first step the graph is decomposed into smaller components, and in the second step
we find a set of edges for each component. The second step is an iterative approximation
algorithm in which at each iteration a node or component of the graph is deleted and
then re-attached in a way that improves the overall objective function.
We performed a thorough empirical evaluation, in which we ran our algorithm on
two separate data sets. On the first data set we witnessed a substantial improvement
in runtime at a relatively small cost in performance. On the second data set, we show
that our method scales to an untyped entailment graph containing 20,000 nodes, much
larger than was previously possible using state-of-the-art global methods. We see that
using a global algorithm improves precision for modest values of recall, but that local
methods can achieve higher recall than global methods. We perform an analysis and
conclude that the main reason for this limitation is predicate ambiguity, which results
in graphs that do not adhere to the structural constraints of transitivity and forest
reducibility.
In future work, we hope to address the problem of predicate ambiguity. A natural
direction is to combine methods that model the context-sensitivity of predicates with
global structural assumptions. In this way, one can apply structural constraints for
a set of predicates, given that they appear in similar contexts. A second important
direction for future work is to demonstrate that using entailment rules learned by our
method improves performance in downstream semantic applications such as QA, IE,
and Recognizing Textual Entailment.

Appendix A. Max-Trans-Forest Is NP-hard
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885058823529">
In this appendix we show that the Max-Trans-Forest problem (8) is NP-hard. We
prove that the following decision problem (which is clearly easier than Max-Trans-
Forest) is NP-hard: Given a set of nodes V, a function w : V x V -+ R, and an integer
number α, is there a transitive forest-reducible (FRG) subgraph G = (V, E) such that
EeEE w(e) &gt; α? In this appendix we use the standard terminology that for a directed
edge i =:&gt; j, the node i is termed the parent of node j, and the node j is termed the
child of i. We start with a simple polynomial reduction from the following decision
problem.
Max-Sub-FRG: Given a directed graph G = (V, E), a function w : E -+ Z+, and
a positive integer α, is there a transitive FRG subgraph G&apos; = (V, E&apos;) such that
EeEE, w(e) &gt; α?
Max-Sub-FRG &lt;p Max-Trans-Forest: Given an instance (G = (V, E), w, α) of Max-
Sub-FRG, we construct the instance (G&apos; = (V, E&apos;), w&apos;, α) of Max-Trans-Forest such
that w&apos;(u,v) = w(u,v) if (u, v) E E and −oo otherwise. We need to show that (G =
(V, E), w, α) E Max-Sub-FRG iff (G&apos; = (V, E&apos;), w&apos;, α) E Max-Trans-Forest. This is trivial: If
there is a transitive FRG subgraph of G whose sum of edges &gt; α, then choosing the same
edges will yield a transitive FRG subgraph of G&apos; whose sum of edges &gt; α. Similarly, any

transitive FRG subgraph of G&apos; whose sum of edges &gt; α cannot use any −oo edges, and
therefore the edges of this FRG are in E and this defines a subgraph of G whose sum of
edges &gt; α.
Note that for Max-Sub-FRG, maximizing the sum of weights of edges in the sub-
graph is equivalent to minimizing the sum of weights of edges not in the subgraph. We
now denote by z the sum of weights of the edges deleted from the graph.
Next we show a polynomial reduction from the NP-hard Exact Cover by 3-sets
(X3C) problem (Garey and Johnson 1979) to Max-Sub-FRG. The X3C is defined as
follows. Given a set X of size 3n, and m subsets, S1, S2, .., Sm of X, each of size 3, decide
if there is a collection of n Si’s whose union covers X.
X3C &lt;p Max-Sub-FRG: Given an instance (X, S) of X3C problem, we construct an
instance (G = (V, E), w, z) of the Max-Sub-FRG problem as follows (an illustration of the
construction is given in Figure A.1). First, we construct the vertices V: We construct
x1,.., x3n vertices, corresponding to the points of X, m vertices s1,.., sm corresponding to
the subsets S, m additional vertices t1, t2, .., tm, and one more vertex a. Next we construct
the edges E and the weight function w : E -+ Z+.

To complete the construction of the Max-Sub-FRG problem, we define z = 4m − 2n. We
next prove that S has an exact 3-cover of X 4=&gt; there is a transitive FRG subgraph of G
such that the sum of weights deleted is no more than 4m − 2n.
=&gt;: Assume there is an exact 3-cover of X by S. The FRG subgraph will consist of: n
edges (a, si) for the n vertices si that cover X, the 3n edges (si, xj), and m − n edges (tf, sf),
for the m − n vertices sf that do not cover X. The transitive closure contains all edges
(a, xi), and the rest of the edges are deleted: for all sf ’s that are not part of the cover, the
three edges (sf, xj), and the edge (a, sf ) are deleted. In addition, the weight 2 edges (ti, si)
for the si’s that cover X are deleted. The total weight deleted is thus 3(m − n) + m − n +
2n = 4m − 2n. It is easy to verify that the subgraph is a transitive FRG - there are no
connected components of size &gt; 1, and in the transitive reduction of G there is no node
with more than one parent.
�: Assume there is no exact 3-cover of X by S, we will show that any FRG subgraph
must delete more than 4m − 2n weight. We cannot omit any edge (a, xi), as the weight
of each such edge is too large. Thus all these edges are in the FRG and are either deleted
during transitive reduction or not.
Assume first that all these edges are deleted in the transitive reduction, that is,
for every xj there exists an si such that (a, si) and (si, xj) are in the forest. Since there
is no collection of n subsets Si that cover X, there must be at least k &gt; n such si’s.
Consequently, for these si’s, the forest must not contain the edges (ti, si) (otherwise, si
would have two parents and violate both the forest and the transitivity properties). For
the m − k nodes with no edge (sf, xj) we can either add an edge (a, sf ) or (tf, sf ), but
not both (otherwise, sf would have more than one parent). Since w(tf,sf) &gt; w(a,sf) it
is better to delete the (a,sf ) edges. Hence, the total weight of deleted edges is 3m − 3n
for the edges between si’s and xj’s, 2k in the edges (ti,si), for si’s that cover the xj’s,
and m − k for the edges (a, sf ). Total weight deleted is 4m − 3n + k &gt; 4m − 2n since
k &gt; n.
Assume now that r &gt; 0 edges (a, xj) are not deleted in the transitive reduction. This
means that for these xj’s there is no edge (si, xj) for any i (otherwise, xj will have more
than one parent after transitive reduction). This means that 3n − r of the xj’s are covered
by si’s. To cover xj’s we need at least k &gt; In − r3] si’s. As before, for these si’s we also
have the edges (a, si) and we delete the edges (ti, si), and for the m − k nodes sf that
do not cover any xj it is best to add the edges (tf,sf) and to delete the edges (a,sf ). So
the weight deleted is 3m − (3n − r) for edges between si and xj, 2k in the edges (ti, si),
and m − k for the edges (a, sf ). Thus, the weight deleted is 4m − 3n + k + r &gt; 4m − 3n +
Ln−r3]+r&gt;4m−2n+r− Lr3] &gt;4m−2n.■
Because it is known that X3C is NP-hard, this polynomial reduction shows that
Max-Trans-Forest is also NP-hard.

<abstract confidence="0.993563333333333">Entailment rules between predicates are fundamental to many semantic-inference applications. Consequently, learning such rules has been an active field of research in recent years. Methods for learning entailment rules between predicates that take into account dependencies between different rules (e.g., entailment is a transitive relation) have been shown to improve rule quality, but suffer from scalability issues, that is, the number of predicates handled is often quite small. In this article, we present methods for learning transitive graphs that contain tens of thousands of nodes, where nodes represent predicates and edges correspond to entailment rules (termed entailment graphs). Our methods are able to scale to a large number of predicates by exploiting structural properties of entailment graphs such as the fact that they exhibit a “tree-like” property. We apply our methods on two data sets and demonstrate that our methods find high-quality solutions faster than methods proposed in the past, and moreover our methods for the first time scale to large graphs containing 20,000 nodes and more than 100,000 edges.</abstract>

Conclusions The problem of language variability is at the heart of many semantic applications such as Information Extraction, Question Answering, Semantic Parsing, and more. Consequently, learning broad coverage knowledge bases of entailment rules and paraphrases (Ganitkevitch, Van Durme, and Callison-Burch 2013) has proved crucial for systems that perform inference over textual representations (Stern and Dagan 2012; Angeli and Manning 2014). 257 Computational Linguistics Volume 41, Number 2 In this article, we have presented algorithms for learning entailment rules between predicates that can scale to large sets of predicates. Our work builds on prior work by Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012), who defined the concept of entailment graphs, and formulated entailment rule learning as a graph optimization problem, where the graph has to obey the structural constraint of transitivity. Our main contribution is a heuristic polynomial approximation algorithm that can learn entailment graphs containing tens of thousands of nodes. The </context>

This also accommodates rules such as play(Xteam,Yteam) ⇒ play(Yteam,Xteam): If team A plays team B, then team B plays team A. To create typed entailment graphs, we used a data set that was generously provided by Schoenmackers et al. (2010). Schoenmackers et al. produced a mapping of 1.1 million arguments into 156 types (Examples for (argument, TYPE) pairs are (exodus, BOOK), (china, COUNTRY), and (asthma, DISEASE)), and then utilized the types, the mapped arguments, and 1 million TextRunner tuples (Banko et al. 2007) to generate a set of 10,672 typed predicates.3 Because entailment can only occur between predicates that share the same types, we decomposed the 10,672 typed predicates into 2,303 typed entailment graphs. The largest graph contains 188 nodes and the total number of potential rules is 263,756.4 The advantage of typing predicates is that it substantially reduces ambiguity, while still maintaining rules of wide applicability. 4.2 Training a Local Entailment Classifier The weighting function w is derived from an entailment score provided by a local classifier.

In textual entailment, the goal is to recognize, given two text fragments termed text and hypothesis, whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text. For example, the text Cyprus was invaded by the Ottoman Empire in 1571 implies the hypothesis The Ottomans attacked Cyprus. Semantic inference applications such as QA and IE crucially rely on entailment rules (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002; Shinyama and Sekine 2006; Berant and Liang 2014) or equivalently, inference rules—that is, rules that describe a directional inference relation between two fragments of text. An important type of entailment rule specifies the entailment relation between natural language predicates, for example, the entailment rule X invade Y=&gt;X attack Y can be helpful in inferring the aforementioned hypothesis. Consequently, substantial effort has been made to learn such rules (Lin and Pantel 2001; Sekine 2005; Szpektor and Dagan 2008; Schoenmackers et al. 2010; Melamud et al. 2013).

We briefly describe the first two and then expand more on distributional similarity, which is the most commonly used source of information. Lexicographic resources are manually built knowledge bases from which semantic information may be extracted. For example, the hyponymy, toponymy, and synonymy relations in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) can be used to detect entailment between nouns and verbs. Although WordNet is the most popular lexicographic resource, other resources such as CatVar, Nomlex, and FrameNet have also been utilized to extract inference rules (Meyers et al. 2004; Budanitsky and Hirst 2006; Szpektor and Dagan 2009; Coyne and Rambow 2009; Ben Aharon, Szpektor, and Dagan 2010). Pattern-based methods attempt to identify the semantic relation between a pair of predicates by examining their co-occurrence in a large corpus. For example, the sentence people snore while they sleep provides evidence that snore ⇒ sleep. While most patternbased methods focused on identifying semantic relations between nouns (for example, Hearst patterns [Hearst 1992]), several works (Pekar 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky 2011; Weisman et al. 2012) attempted to extract relations between predicates as well.

The solution when applying LP relaxation is not a transitive graph; we will show in Section 4 that our approximation method is substantially faster. Global inference has gained popularity in recent years in NLP, and a common approximation method that has been extensively utilized is dual decomposition (Sontag, Globerson, and Jaakkola 2011). Dual decomposition has been successfully applied in 226 Berant et al. Efficient Global Learning of Entailment Graphs tasks such as Information Extraction (Reichart and Barzilay 2012), Machine Translation (Chang and Collins 2011), Parsing (Rush et al. 2012), and Named Entity Recognition (Wang, Che, and Manning 2013). To the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been applied for the task of learning entailment relations. The graph decomposition method we present in Section 3.1 can be viewed as an ideal case of dual decomposition, where we can decompose the problem into disjoint components in a way that we do not need to ensure consistency of the results obtained on each component separately. 3.

In addition, for pairs of predicates for which at least one distributional similarity feature is non-zero, we add lexicographic features computed from WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel 2004), and CatVar (Habash and Dorr 2003), as well as string-similarity features.

However, we can convert it to a directed forest by applying the following operations. Any directed graph G can be converted into a StronglyConnected-Component (SCC) graph in the following way: Every strongly connected component is contracted into a single node, and an edge is added from SCC S1 to SCC S2 if there is an edge in G from some node in S1 to some node in S2. The SCC graph is always a DAG (Cormen et al. 2002), and if G is transitive, then the SCC graph is also transitive. The graph in Figure 2b is the SCC graph of the one in Figure 2a, but is still not a directed forest because the node X be epidemic in Y has two parents. The transitive closure of a directed graph G is obtained by adding an edge from node i to node j if there is a path in G from i to j. The transitive reduction of G is obtained by removing all edges whose absence does not affect its transitive closure. In DAGs, the result of transitive reduction is unique (Aho, Garey, and Ullman 1972). We thus define the reduced graph Gred = (Vred</context>

These recursive definitions allow computing in linear time Sv-in(c) and Sv-out(c) for all c (given 9red) using dynamic programming, before going over the cases for re-attaching v. Sv-in(c) is computed going over Vred leaves-to-root (post-order), and Sv-out(c) is computed going over Vred root-to-leaves (pre-order). Re-attachment is summarized in Algorithm 3. Computing an SCC graph is linear (Cormen et al. 2002), and it is easy to verify that transitive reduction in FRGs is also linear (Line 1). Computing Sv-in(c) and Sv-out(c) (Lines 2–3) is also linear, as explained. Cases 1 and 2b are trivially linear and in case 2a we go over the children of all nodes in Vred. As the reduced graph is a forest, this simply means going over all nodes of Vred, and so the entire algorithm is linear. Because re-attachment is linear, re-attaching all nodes is quadratic. Thus if we bound the number of iterations over all nodes, the overall complexity is quadratic. This is dramatically more efficient and scalable than ap</context>

Lexicographic resources are manually built knowledge bases from which semantic information may be extracted. For example, the hyponymy, toponymy, and synonymy relations in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) can be used to detect entailment between nouns and verbs. Although WordNet is the most popular lexicographic resource, other resources such as CatVar, Nomlex, and FrameNet have also been utilized to extract inference rules (Meyers et al. 2004; Budanitsky and Hirst 2006; Szpektor and Dagan 2009; Coyne and Rambow 2009; Ben Aharon, Szpektor, and Dagan 2010). Pattern-based methods attempt to identify the semantic relation between a pair of predicates by examining their co-occurrence in a large corpus. For example, the sentence people snore while they sleep provides evidence that snore ⇒ sleep.

In textual entailment, the goal is to recognize, given two text fragments termed text and hypothesis, whether the hypothesis can be inferred from the text. For example, the text Cyprus was invaded by the Ottoman Empire in 1571 implies the hypothesis The Ottomans attacked Cyprus. Semantic inference applications such as QA and IE crucially rely on entailment rules (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002; Shinyama and Sekine 2006; Berant and Liang 2014) or equivalently, inference rules—that is, rules that describe a directional inference relation between two fragments of text.

For example, argument variables in the work of Schoenmackers et al. were restricted to belong to one of 156 types, such as country or profession. A different solution that has attracted substantial attention recently is to represent the various contexts in which a predicate can appear in a low-dimensional latent space (for example, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation [Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003]) and infer entailment relations between predicates based on the contexts in which they appear (Ritter, Mausam, and Etzioni 2010; ´OS´eaghdha 2010; Dinu and Lapata 2010; Melamud et al. 2013).

In this article, we present efficient and scalable heuristic approximation algorithms for the optimization problem they propose. In recent years, there has been substantial work on approximation algorithms for global inference problems. Do and Roth (2010) suggested a method for the related task of learning taxonomic relations between terms. Given a pair of terms, they construct a small graph that contains the two terms and a few other related terms, and then impose constraints on the graph structure. They construct these small graphs because their work is geared towards scenarios where relations are determined on-the-fly for a given pair of terms and no global knowledge base is ever explicitly constructed.

Finding the undirected edges (Line 1) and computing connected components (Line 2) can be performed in O(V2). Thus, in this case the efficiency of the algorithm is dominated by the application of an ILP solver (Line 4). If the entailment graph decomposes into small components, one could obtain an exact solution with an ILP solver, applied on each component separately, without resorting to any approximation. To further extend scalability in this setting we use a cutting-plane method (Kelley 1960). Cutting-plane methods have been used in the past, for example, in dependency parsing (Riedel and Clarke 2006). The idea is that even if we omit all transitivity constraints, we still expect most transitivity constraints to be satisfied, given a good weighting function w. Thus, it makes sense to avoid specifying the constraints ahead of time, but rather add them when they are violated. This is formalized in Algorithm 2.

As reported by Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012), we find that injecting prior knowledge into the graph improves performance, as it provides a good starting point for the inference procedure. 4.3 Experimental Evaluation To evaluate performance, we manually annotated all edges in 10 typed entailment graphs containing 14, 14, 22, 30, 53, 62, 76, 86, 118, and 118 nodes. This annotation yielded 3,427 edges and 35,585 non-edges, resulting in an empirical edge density of 9%.

An important type of entailment rule specifies the entailment relation between natural language predicates, for example, the entailment rule X invade Y=&gt;X attack Y can be helpful in inferring the aforementioned hypothesis.

Textual entailment is inherently a transitive relation, that is, the rules x =&gt; y and y =&gt; z imply the rule x =&gt; z. For example, from the rules X reduce nausea =&gt; X help with nausea and X help with nausea =&gt; X associated with nausea we can infer the rule X reduce nausea =&gt; X associated with nausea (Figure 1).

Chklovsky and Pantel (2004) used pattern-based methods to generate the commonly used VerbOcean resource. Both lexicographic as well as pattern-based methods suffer from limited coverage. Distributional similarity is therefore used to automatically construct broad-scale resources. Distributional similarity methods are based on the “distributional hypothesis” (Harris 1954) that semantically similar predicates occur with similar arguments. Quite a few methods have been suggested (Lin and Pantel 2001; Szpektor et al. 2004; Bhagat, Pantel, and Hovy 2007; Szpektor and Dagan 2008; Yates and Etzioni 2009; Schoenmackers et al. 2010), which differ in terms of the specifics of the ways in which predicates are represented, the features that are extracted, and the function used to compute feature vector similarity. Next, we elaborate on the methods that we use in this article. Lin and Pantel (2001) proposed an algorithm for learning paraphrase relations between binary predicates, that is, predicates with two variables such as X treat Y. For each binary predicate, Lin and Pantel compute two sets of</context>

The first six scores are computed by trying all combinations of two similarity functions Lin and BInc with three types of feature representations (see Section 2): (a) A feature is a pair of arguments. For example, a feature for the typed predicate invade(COUNTRY,CITY) might be (germany,leningrad) or (england,paris). (b) Predicate representation is binary, and each typed predicate has two feature vectors, one for the X slot and one for the Y slot. Similarities are computed for each vector separately and are then combined by a geometric average (as in DIRT [Lin and Pantel 2001]). For example, the predicate invade(COUNTRY,CITY) will have a feature vector for its X slot with features such as germany and england, and a feature vector for its Y slot with features such as leningrad and paris. (c) Binary typed predicates are decomposed into two unary typed predicates, and similarity is computed separately for each unary Table 1 Automatically generated training set examples.

We do not present the results of TNCF in this experiment, because for medium-sized graphs it provides results that are almost identical to TNF.

Lexicographic resources are manually built knowledge bases from which semantic information may be extracted. For example, the hyponymy, toponymy, and synonymy relations in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) can be used to detect entailment between nouns and verbs. Although WordNet is the most popular lexicographic resource, other resources such as CatVar, Nomlex, and FrameNet have also been utilized to extract inference rules (Meyers et al. 2004; Budanitsky and Hirst 2006; Szpektor and Dagan 2009; Coyne and Rambow 2009; Ben Aharon, Szpektor, and Dagan 2010).

Negative pairs are generated using WordNet direct co-hyponyms (sister terms), but we also utilize Word hyponyms at distance 2. In addition, we generate negative examples by randomly sampling pairs of typed predicates that share the same types. Table 1 provides an example for each type of automatically generated training example. It has been noted in the past that the WordNet verb hierarchy contains a certain amount of noise (Richens 2008; Roth and Frank 2012). However, we use WordNet only to generate examples for training a statistical classifier, and thus we can tolerate some noise in the generated examples. In fact, we have noticed that simple variants in training set generation do not result in substantial differences in classifier performance. 2.

Thus, in this case the efficiency of the algorithm is dominated by the application of an ILP solver (Line 4). If the entailment graph decomposes into small components, one could obtain an exact solution with an ILP solver, applied on each component separately, without resorting to any approximation. To further extend scalability in this setting we use a cutting-plane method (Kelley 1960). Cutting-plane methods have been used in the past, for example, in dependency parsing (Riedel and Clarke 2006). The idea is that even if we omit all transitivity constraints, we still expect most transitivity constraints to be satisfied, given a good weighting function w. Thus, it makes sense to avoid specifying the constraints ahead of time, but rather add them when they are violated. This is formalized in Algorithm 2.

Training set generation Positive examples are generated using WordNet synonyms and hypernyms. Negative pairs are generated using WordNet direct co-hyponyms (sister terms), but we also utilize Word hyponyms at distance 2. In addition, we generate negative examples by randomly sampling pairs of typed predicates that share the same types. Table 1 provides an example for each type of automatically generated training example. It has been noted in the past that the WordNet verb hierarchy contains a certain amount of noise (Richens 2008; Roth and Frank 2012). However, we use WordNet only to generate examples for training a statistical classifier, and thus we can tolerate some noise in the generated examples. In fact, we have noticed that simple variants in training set generation do not result in substantial differences in classifier performance. 2. Feature representation Each example pair of typed predicates (p1,p2) is represented by a feature vector, where each feature is a distributional similarity score estimating whether p1 entails p2. We compute 11 distributional similarity scores for each pair of typed predicates, based on their arguments </context>

The solution when applying LP relaxation is not a transitive graph; we will show in Section 4 that our approximation method is substantially faster. Global inference has gained popularity in recent years in NLP, and a common approximation method that has been extensively utilized is dual decomposition (Sontag, Globerson, and Jaakkola 2011). Dual decomposition has been successfully applied in 226 Berant et al. Efficient Global Learning of Entailment Graphs tasks such as Information Extraction (Reichart and Barzilay 2012), Machine Translation (Chang and Collins 2011), Parsing (Rush et al. 2012), and Named Entity Recognition (Wang, Che, and Manning 2013). To the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been applied for the task of learning entailment relations. The graph decomposition method we present in Section 3.1 can be viewed as an ideal case of dual decomposition, where we can decompose the problem into disjoint components in a way that we do not need to ensure consistency of the results obtained on each component separately. 3.

In the experiments presented in this article we will use the representation of Schoenmackers et al. in one experiment, and ignore the problem of predicate ambiguity in the other. 225 Computational Linguistics Volume 41, Number 2 2.2 Global Learning The idea of global learning is that, by jointly learning semantic relations between a large number of natural language phrases, one can use the dependencies between the relations to improve accuracy. A natural way to model that is with a graph where nodes are phrases and edges represent semantic similarity. Snow, Jurafsky, and Ng (2006) presented one of the early examples of global learning in the context of learning noun taxonomies. In their work, they enforced a transitivity constraint over the taxonomy using a greedy inference procedure and demonstrated that this improves the quality of the taxonomy. Transitivity constraints were also enforced by Yates and Etzioni (2009), who proposed a clustering algorithm for learning undirected synonymy relations. Nakashole, Weikum, and Suchanek (2012) learned a taxonomy of binary predicates and also enforced transitivity with a greedy algorithm. Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012) de</context>

Conclusions The problem of language variability is at the heart of many semantic applications such as Information Extraction, Question Answering, Semantic Parsing, and more. Consequently, learning broad coverage knowledge bases of entailment rules and paraphrases (Ganitkevitch, Van Durme, and Callison-Burch 2013) has proved crucial for systems that perform inference over textual representations (Stern and Dagan 2012; Angeli and Manning 2014). 257 Computational Linguistics Volume 41, Number 2 In this article, we have presented algorithms for learning entailment rules between predicates that can scale to large sets of predicates. Our work builds on prior work by Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012), who defined the concept of entailment graphs, and formulated entailment rule learning as a graph optimization problem, where the graph has to obey the structural constraint of transitivity.

Distributional similarity is therefore used to automatically construct broad-scale resources. Distributional similarity methods are based on the “distributional hypothesis” (Harris 1954) that semantically similar predicates occur with similar arguments. Quite a few methods have been suggested (Lin and Pantel 2001; Szpektor et al. 2004; Bhagat, Pantel, and Hovy 2007; Szpektor and Dagan 2008; Yates and Etzioni 2009; Schoenmackers et al. 2010), which differ in terms of the specifics of the ways in which predicates are represented, the features that are extracted, and the function used to compute feature vector similarity.

Szpektor and Dagan (2008) suggested two modifications to DIRT. First, they looked at unary predicates, that is, predicates with a single variable such as X treat. Secondly, they computed a directional score that is more suited for capturing entailment relations compared to the symmetric Lin score. They proposed that if for two unary predicates u ⇒ v, then relatively many of the features of u should be covered by the features of v.

We do not present the results of TNCF in this experiment, because for medium-sized graphs it provides results that are almost identical to TNF. The No-trans baseline is a state-of-the-art local learning algorithm. It uses state-ofthe-art local scores such as DIRT (Lin and Pantel 2001), BInc (Szpektor and Dagan 2008), Cover (Weeds and Weir 2003), and SR (Schoenmackers et al. 2010) and trains a classifier using these scores. Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2010) have demonstrated empiricially that training a classifier over multiple similarity scores improves performance compared with using just a single similarity score. The Exact-graph algorithm is the state-of-the-art global method presented by Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012).

Lexicographic resources are manually built knowledge bases from which semantic information may be extracted. For example, the hyponymy, toponymy, and synonymy relations in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) can be used to detect entailment between nouns and verbs. Although WordNet is the most popular lexicographic resource, other resources such as CatVar, Nomlex, and FrameNet have also been utilized to extract inference rules (Meyers et al. 2004; Budanitsky and Hirst 2006; Szpektor and Dagan 2009; Coyne and Rambow 2009; Ben Aharon, Szpektor, and Dagan 2010). Pattern-based methods attempt to identify the semantic relation between a pair of predicates by examining their co-occurrence in a large corpus. For example, the sentence people snore while they sleep provides evidence that snore ⇒ sleep. While most patternbased methods focused on identifying semantic relations between nouns (for example, Hearst patterns [Hearst 1992]), several works (Pekar 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky 2011; Weisman et al. 2012) attempted to extract relations between predicates as well.

The other five scores were provided by Schoenmackers et al. (Schoenmackers et al. 2010) and include SR (Schoenmackers et al. 2010), LIME (McCreath and Sharma 1997), M-estimate (Dzeroski and Brakto 1992), the standard G-test, and a simple implementation of Cover (Weeds and Weir 2003). Overall, the rationale behind this representation is that combining various scores will yield a better classifier than each single measure. 3.

We do not present the results of TNCF in this experiment, because for medium-sized graphs it provides results that are almost identical to TNF. The No-trans baseline is a state-of-the-art local learning algorithm. It uses state-ofthe-art local scores such as DIRT (Lin and Pantel 2001), BInc (Szpektor and Dagan 2008), Cover (Weeds and Weir 2003), and SR (Schoenmackers et al. 2010) and trains a classifier using these scores. Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2010) have demonstrated empiricially that training a classifier over multiple similarity scores improves performance compared with using just a single similarity score. The Exact-graph algorithm is the state-of-the-art global method presented by Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012). It finds the optimal solution for Max-TransGraph, and our goal is to show that we can obtain good performance more efficiently using our approximation methods.

Pattern-based methods attempt to identify the semantic relation between a pair of predicates by examining their co-occurrence in a large corpus. For example, the sentence people snore while they sleep provides evidence that snore ⇒ sleep. While most patternbased methods focused on identifying semantic relations between nouns (for example, Hearst patterns [Hearst 1992]), several works (Pekar 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky 2011; Weisman et al. 2012) attempted to extract relations between predicates as well. Chklovsky and Pantel (2004) used pattern-based methods to generate the commonly used VerbOcean resource. Both lexicographic as well as pattern-based methods suffer from limited coverage. Distributional similarity is therefore used to automatically construct broad-scale resources. Distributional similarity methods are based on the “distributional hypothesis” (Harris 1954) that semantically similar predicates occur with similar arguments.

Distributional similarity methods are based on the “distributional hypothesis” (Harris 1954) that semantically similar predicates occur with similar arguments. Quite a few methods have been suggested (Lin and Pantel 2001; Szpektor et al. 2004; Bhagat, Pantel, and Hovy 2007; Szpektor and Dagan 2008; Yates and Etzioni 2009; Schoenmackers et al. 2010), which differ in terms of the specifics of the ways in which predicates are represented, the features that are extracted, and the function used to compute feature vector similarity. Next, we elaborate on the methods that we use in this article. Lin and Pantel (2001) proposed an algorithm for learning paraphrase relations between binary predicates, that is, predicates with two variables such as X treat Y. For each binary predicate, Lin and Pantel compute two sets of features Fx and Fy, 224 Berant et al. Efficient Global Learning of Entailment Graphs which are the wo</context>

This is captured by the asymmetric Cover measure (Weeds and Weir 2003): Ef∈Fu∩Fv wu( f ) Cover(u, v) = (2) Ef∈Fu wu( f ) The final directional score, termed BInc (Balanced Inclusion), is the geometric average of the Lin measure and the Cover measure. Both Lin and Pantel as well as Szpektor and Dagan compute a similarity score using a single argument. However, it is clear that although this alleviates sparsity problems, considering pairs of arguments jointly provides more information. Yates and Etzioni (2009), Schoenmackers et al. (2010), and even earlier, Szpektor et al. (2004), presented methods that compute semantic similarity based on pairs of arguments. A problem common to all local methods presented above is predicate ambiguity— predicates may have different meanings and different entailment relations in different contexts. Some works resolved the problem of ambiguity by representing predicates with argument variables that are typed (Pantel et al. 2007; Schoenmackers et al. 2010). For example, argument variables in the work of Schoenmackers et al. were restricted to belong to one of 156 type</context>

A natural way to model that is with a graph where nodes are phrases and edges represent semantic similarity. Snow, Jurafsky, and Ng (2006) presented one of the early examples of global learning in the context of learning noun taxonomies. In their work, they enforced a transitivity constraint over the taxonomy using a greedy inference procedure and demonstrated that this improves the quality of the taxonomy. Transitivity constraints were also enforced by Yates and Etzioni (2009), who proposed a clustering algorithm for learning undirected synonymy relations. Nakashole, Weikum, and Suchanek (2012) learned a taxonomy of binary predicates and also enforced transitivity with a greedy algorithm. Berant, Dagan, and Goldberger (2012) developed a global method for learning entailment relations between predicates. In this article we present scalable approximation algorithms for the optimization problem they propose, and so we provide further detail on their method. The input to their algorithm is a large corpus and a lexicographic resource, such as WordNet, and the output is </context>
