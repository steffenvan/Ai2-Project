COLING 84: Call for Papers
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.937123444444445">
COLING 84, the 10th International Conference on
Computational Linguistics, is scheduled for 2-6 July
1984 at Stanford University, Stanford, California. It
will also constitute the 22nd Annual Meeting of the
Association for Computational Linguistics, which will
host the conference.
Papers for the meeting are solicited on linguistically
and computationally significant topics, including but
not limited to the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999985090909091">
• Machine translation and machine-aided translation.
• Computational applications in syntax, semantics,
anaphora, and discourse.
• Knowledge representation.
• Speech analysis, synthesis, recognition, and under-
standing.
• Phonological and morpho-syntactic analysis.
• Algorithms.
• Computational models of linguistic theories.
• Parsing and generation.
• Lexicology and lexicography.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.858699476190476">
Authors wishing to present a paper should submit
five copies of a summary not more than eight double-
spaced pages long, by 9 January 1984 to:
Prof. Yorick Wilks
Languages and Linguistics
University of Essex
Colchester, Essex, C04 3SQ, ENGLAND
phone: 44-(206) 862 286;
telex 98440 (UNILIB G)
It is important that the summary contain sufficient
information, including references to relevant literature,
to convey the new ideas and allow the program com-
mittee to determine the scope of the work. Authors
should clearly indicate to what extent the work is com-
plete and, if relevant, to what extent it has been im-
plemented. A summary exceeding eight double-spaced
pages in length may not receive the attention it de-
serves.
Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their
papers by 2 April 1984. Full length versions of ac-
cepted papers should be sent by 14 May 1984 to

<bodyText confidence="0.987589642857143">
Papers are solicited for a special issue of the American
Journal of Computational Linguistics that is being plan-
ned around the theme, &amp;quot;Processing Ill-formed
Language&amp;quot;. These forms are common. Examples
include misspellings, ungrammaticalities, sentence frag-
ments, semantic anomalies, and failed attempts at ref-
erence. They also include inputs that cannot be com-
pletely understood because of limits in the natural
language system.
The issue will highlight recent progress in text
processing and natural language interfaces in identify-
ing and interpreting these forms.

Tutorial on Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992097666666667">
The University of Geneva, Institut Dalle Molle, IS-
SCO, announces a tutorial on machine translation will
be held in Lugano, Switzerland, 2-7 April 1984.
Machine Translation (MT) has grown into a disci-
pline with many facets. The aim of this tutorial is to
convey the state of the art by allowing experts in dif-
ferent aspects of MT to present their particular point
of view. Sessions concerning the contribution of theo-
retical and computational linguistics, computer science,
expert systems design, combined with discussions on
the development of MT, and its possible future evolu-
tion will make up a tutorial which should be relevant
to all concerned with the relationship between natural
language translation and computers.
