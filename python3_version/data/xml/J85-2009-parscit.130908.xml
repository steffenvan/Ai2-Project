Most of this book (the first 148 pages) is an English
version of an introduction to mathematical linguistics
originally published in Russian in 1969. This material
has been expanded into a more standard-sized book for
the English-speaking market by tacking on three articles
on special topics in mathematical linguistics published
elsewhere by one or both co-authors; but each of these
articles is already available in English translation, and the
book stands or falls by the usefulness of its first part.
When Gladkij and Mel&apos;euk wrote their book in the
late 1960s, mathematical linguistics was little known,
even in the USA where most of it had been created not
long before. I guess that it was a fairly remarkable
achievement on their part to discover and master this
exotic discipline (and, in Gladkij&apos;s case, to make a
number of original contributions to it), and then to make
it known to their fellow-countrymen.
However, whether it makes good sense to bring out an
English version of the book in the 1980s is a different
matter. I must say that I feel the answer is no, for many
reasons.
In the first place, mathematical linguistics has moved
on since the 1960s. Gladkij and Mel&apos;euk&apos;s book deals
almost exclusively with the hierarchy of types of
language, defined in terms of types of grammar (unre-
stricted rewrite systems, context-sensitive grammars,
context-free grammars, one-sided linear grammars), with
a small amount on the relationship with types of automa-
ta, on decidability theorems, and a few other matters.
The topic of parsing — and mathematical formalisms with
special relevance for automatic language processing, such
as the ATN — are not mentioned. In 1969, one would not
have expected them to be; in the 1980s, these are surely
indispensable components even in an introduction to
&amp;quot;mathematical&amp;quot; (as opposed to &amp;quot;computational&amp;quot;) linguis-
tics. Gladkij and Mel&apos;euk are quite explicit about the fact
that they have made no attempt to bring the book up to
date: &amp;quot;The manuscript of the Russian version of this
book was completed in 1967 and we are not in a position
to revise it now. . . . Even a mere list of references
would be out of the question.&amp;quot;
Secondly, the book relies heavily on Russian-language
examples which are lost on an English reader. Thus,
early chapters largely revolve round a largish formal
grammar produced by the authors in order to generate
the complex range of Russian participles. It must have
been a significant virtue of the original book that it
demonstrated how the concepts of mathematical linguis-
tics could be made to achieve a novel task relating specif-
ically to the readers&apos; own language, but for a British or
American student the result is that ideas many people
find difficult at the best of times are rendered wholly
opaque.
And, finally, Gladkij and Mereuk just are not very
good at writing for an unknowledgeable audience. They
make their formal rules notationally much more complex
and exotic-looking than they need be — to a fellow math-
ematician, a trivial matter, but for an unconfident student
very unfortunate. On page 25 they use the term monoid
without, I think, ever explaining what it means (there is
no index, so it is hard to check); on page 81 they use a
technical term of their own which is first defined on page
122.
The fact is that there are now enough English-lan-
guage books that do the same job as this book and do it
much better.

&amp;quot;Semantic interpretation&amp;quot; is an expression that seems to
mean something different to everyone who uses it. What
it means to van Bakel is translation from a Dutch surface
form into a case-like structure, which is expressed in a
language called SELANCA. The interpretation retains the

content words but not the structure of the input; that is,
it is not an expression in an interlingua or knowledge
representation that is independent of the source
language.
Van Bakel takes view of both language and linguistics
counter to those currently prevailing in North America (I
don&apos;t know about Europe or elsewhere). First, he rejects
any connection between theoretical linguistics and
computational linguistics, seeing the former as no longer
having anything to say to the latter, which may now
proceed solely as an application-oriented enterprise.
Second, in contrast to the situation semantics view a la
Barwise and Perry (1983), van Bakel sees reality as
being structure or constrained by language rather than
the other way round. &amp;quot;The reality which is related to [a

word such as] fat would not exist as such if it were not
created by language. There is no ground to postulate an
autonomous reality that is referred to, by natural
language&amp;quot; (pp. 35-36).
Either in consequence of these views, or despite them
— I can&apos;t decide which — van Bakel explicitly rejects
semantic interpretation that &amp;quot;manipulates reality or . . .
a model of reality&amp;quot; (p. 33), such a database update and
retrieval:
I do not want a certain part of the world to be introduced
within the research situation, as is the case in question
answering systems, . . . because I want to stick to
linguistic theory.
. . . Linguistics is passed when reality is reached.
Connecting language and reality will not the task of
linguistics (p. 33).
My study should not be considered as a contribution to
meaning theory or semantics. What the read should
expect is an exposition of a certain view on meaning,
together with a view on semantic interpretation, and an
explanation [of] how this is performed in the model
described (p. 32).
Not withstanding these remarks, van Bakel makes strong
claims for his model: &amp;quot;The . . . system is claimed to be a
model of a native speaker&apos;s competence of understanding
natural language sentences&amp;quot; (p. 1). However, there is
little discussion of the adequacy of SELANCA language
as a representation, even on the author&apos;s own terms;
rather the emphasis is solely on the translation process.
The model itself consists of a context-free parser,
AMAZON, which produces a syntactic structure that is
then converted by the semantic component, CASUS into
a SELANCA expression. There is no feedback from
semantic to syntax; the user is asked to resolve syntac-
tically ambiguous words. If more than one parse is possi-
ble, AMAZON will give all structures; and CASUS may
find more than one interpretation for a given structure.
There is no attempt to solve the ambiguity.
Van Bakel goes into considerable detail about the
operation of CASUS. The interpreter first performs tran-
sformations on the parse tree for detopicalization, elimi-
nating passives, and so forth. It then assigns a case
structure to the sentence, using morphological and simple
lexical features. The interpretation of sentential comple-
ments is given particular attention.
The examples are mostly in Dutch, with literal English
glosses. A knowledge of Dutch is not necessary for read-
ing the book, but it would be helpful, especially for the
detailed examples of the appendices. There are a few
places where more examples would have helped; for
instance, the SELANCA language is introduced with no
examples at all. In the appendices, SELANCA
expressions are rendered impenetrable by their not being
pretty-printed.
I have great admiration for authors such as van Bakel
who can write so fluently in a language not their own.
However, the book would have been improved if copy-
edited by a better speaker of English. The reader is
misled a little too often by misplaced commas, by the
consistent use of it&apos;s for its, and by the occasional wrong
word. Nevertheless, the author&apos;s pleasantly informal
style comes through, even if the argument is a bit hard to
follow at times.
My qualms about this book derive mostly from the
author&apos;s unorthodox views, which he presents strongly
but doesn&apos;t always stick to himself. He believes he is
doing computational linguistics, strictly application-or-
iented; yet he seems to dislike applications such as data-
base interfaces and presents his work as a linguistically
interesting general mode of understanding, and doesn&apos;t
want to constrain his work to subsets useful for inter-
faces (p. 3). He claims the work contributes nothing to
the theory of meaning, and yet calls it semantic interpre-
tation rather than, say, case analysis. And he presents it
as a model of &amp;quot;human understanding&amp;quot; without any
discussion of what human understanding is or why the
model models it.
What&apos;s good about the work is that it is a fine detailed
description of a parser and case analyzer, a system that
may indeed be the prototype of a useful natural language
interface.
