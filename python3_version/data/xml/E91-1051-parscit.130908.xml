Kaplan et al (1989) present an approach
to machine translation based on co-description.
In this paper we show that the notation is not as
natural and expressive as it appears. We first
show that the most natural analysis proposed in
Kaplan et al (1989) cannot in fact cover the
range of data for the important translational
phenomenon in question. This contribution
extends the work reported on in Sadler et al
(1989) and Sadler et al (1990). We then go on
to discuss alternatives which depart from or

<bodyText confidence="0.9991576">
Recent work in LFG uses the notion of
projection to refer to linguistically relevant map-
pings or correspondences between levels,
whether these mappings are direct or involve
function composition (Halvorsen &amp; Kaplan
(1988), Kaplan (1987), Kaplan et al (1989)).
Mapping functions such as ii (from c to f struc-
ture) and a (from c to semantic structure) are
familiar from the LFG literature. Kaplan et al
(1989) extend this approach to Machine Transla-
tion by defining two translation functions
(between f-structures) and (between semantic
structures). By means of these functions, one
can &apos;co-describe&apos; elements of source and target
&amp;structures and s-structures respectively.
Achieving translation can be thought of in terms
of specifying and resolving a set of constraints
on target structures, constraints which are
expressed by means of the T and functions.
The formalism permits a wide variety of
source-target correspondences to be expressed:
and i can be composed, as can t&apos; and a. The
approach allows for equations specifying trans-
lations to be added to lexical entries and (source
language) c-structure rules. For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.58663">
(1) Cr (t SUBJ)) = ((c t) SUBJ)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99208922">
composes T and equating the T of the SUBJ
f-structure with the SUBJ attribute of the r of
the mother&apos;s &amp;structure. Thus (1) says that the
translation of the value of the SUBJ slot in a
source f-structure fills the SUBJ slot in the f-
structure which is the translation of that source
f-structure. What results is an interesting, and
apparently extremely attractive approach to MT,
which finds echoes in a good deal of recent
work in MT and Computational Linguistics gen-
erally (van Noord et al (1990), Zajac (1990)).
Among the apparent advantages are:
that it avoids the problems that arise in
traditional stratiflcational transfer systems
where a variety of (often incompatible)
kinds of information must be expressed in
a single structure.
(ii) that, because it uses the formal apparatus
of LFG, it is at least compatible with a
large body of well worked out linguistic
analyses.
Perhaps most important, however, the
examples that Kaplan et al give suggest that the
notation is both natural and expressive: natural,
in the sense that adequate x relations can be
stated on the basis of reasonable intuitive and
well-motivated linguistic analyses; expressive, in
the sense that it is powerful enough to describe
some difficult translation problems in a straight-
forward way.
In this paper we show that the notation is
not as natural and expressive as it at first seems.
We first show that the most natural analysis pro-
posed in Kaplan et al (1989) cannot in fact
cover the range of data for the translational
phenomenon in question. These cases are impor-
tant because these constructions represent a per-
vasive structural difference between languages
which one wants to be able to deal with in a
natural way. We then go on to discuss alterna-
tives which depart from or extend the formalism
- 293 -
proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) in various
respects, pointing out some directions for further
research.
Section 1
The discussion here concerns the transla-
tional data of head-switching or splitting/fusing
discussed in Kaplan et at (1989) as cases of
differences of embedding:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.934575888888889">
(2a) John just arrived.
Jean vient d&apos;arriver.
(b) Jan zwemt graag/toevallig.
John likes to/happens to swim.
(c) I think that John just arrived.

(d) Ik denk dat Jan graag zwemt.
I think that John likes to swim.
(e) Ich glaube dass Peter gem schwimmt.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979160685714286">
I believe that Peter likes to swim.
Kaplan et al (1989) sketch two alternative
approaches to head-switching. The first assumes
that the adverb is essentially an f-structure head
subcategorising for a sentential ARG. This has
the effect of making the source and target f-
structures rather similar to each other but faces
a number of serious problems. Firstly, it
violates the LFG assumption that the f-structure
of the highest c-structure node contains the f-
structures of all other nodes. Secondly, while
such an analysis might well be correct for
semantic structure, it cannot be justified on
monolingual grounds as a surface syntactic
feature structure (an f-structure). For example,
it is the verb, not the adverb, which is the syn-
tactic head of the construction, carrying tense
and participating in agreement phenomena.
This proposal therefore lacks monolingual
motivation and thus is not attractive as an
approach to translation. Thirdly, the approach
cannot be extended to the case discussed here.
In this paper we focus on the alternative
proposal, in which head-switching (or alterna-
tively, splitting) is a z operation.&apos; Adverbs &apos;are
taken to be f-structure SADJs. The x annotation
to ADVP states that the x of the mother f-
structure is the XCOMP of the x of the SADJ
I Notice that a third possibility, not discussed in Ka-
plan et al (1989), involving a flat f-structure but treating
the adverb as a semantic head at s-structure, simply
means that the mapping problem we describe below ar-
ises in the monolingual mapping between f-structure
and s-structure.

This has the effect of subordinating the transla-
tion of the f-structure which contains the SADJ
to the translation of the SADJ itself. The lexical
entries themselves contribute further x equations
(following Kaplan et al&apos;s fig. 21):

<bodyText confidence="0.99895025">
This is unproblematic for examples such as
(2a,b). The t equations and further information
from the target monolingual lexicon collaborate
to relate (5) to (6):

The equations in (3) and (8) require the transla-

the SADJ attribute (x (13)) to be both a COMP

This is clearly not what is required and on stan-
dard linguistic assumptions, will not be accepted
by the target generator. It does not give a
correct translation of the source string.
In this section we have shown that the
proposal as outlined in Kaplan et al (1989) does
not produce an adequate analysis of these cases.
The problem, which is not at first apparent,
arises from the combination of the regular and
irregular equations from the emphasised lines.
Note that there is no problem stating this
correspondence in the French -&gt; English direc-
tion (see below).
Section 2.0.
In this section we will briefly consider a
number of altematives.3 To facilitate discussion,
it is worth noting that the proposal in Kaplan et
al (1989) involves basically three elements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987709125">
(11a) a set of (regular) equations constraining
both source and target:
(t SUBJ)) = ((x t) SUBJ)
(11b) a set of (regular) equations assigning tar-
get PRED values:
((x t) PRED FN) = sem form
(11c) a (special) equation on ADVP constrain-
ing both source and target:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.963399971428572">
((t SADJ)) XCOMP) = 1)
The problem noted above arises from the
combination of an equation from (a) with
the equation (c).
Section 2.1.
The first alternative we considered
involves maintaining equations of type (a) (so
that ec (f3) is indeed ((c fl) COMP)), and then
switching heads only (rather than whole con-
structions). The basic idea is that the x annota-
tions to ADVP provide a PRED value for cf3
and specify that the x of the PRED of £3 is the
PRED in (cf3 XCOMP). To do this, the PRED
value must be made into a complex feature, and
heavy use is made of x equations on the c-
structure rules, so that the mapping is essentially
structurally determined.
3 These alternatives have been explored by using at
Essex an implementation of PATR due to Bob Car-
penter, and at Edinburgh a version of MicroPATR.
sf 5
- 295 -
Intuitively, the approach works by build-
ing target constructions without assigning them
PRED values directly, then specifying the target
PRED values in such a way that it is possible to
switch the heads for the cases in question. .LP
In fact, though this works for cases such as
(2c,d,e), it is limited to cases in which it is
correct to raise all the dependents of a predicate
to the same slot in the construction headed by
the translation of the adverb. It thus fails with
(12a) in which races must remain a dependent
of the embedded construction, and (12b) in
which the same is true of Jean:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.899504">
(12a) Peter zwemt graag wedstrijden.
Peter likes to swim races.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.936457176470588">
(12b) I said that John will probably come.
J&apos;ai dit qu&apos;il est probable que Jean viendra.
This is of course an immediate consequence of
the fact that the proposal works by switching
not constructions but heads. .SH Section 2.2.
It is clear from the above that any solu-
tion must achieve constructional integrity in
translation. This idea can be achieved in a
number of (slightly different) ways. In the fol-
lowing we exploit the path equation variables
available in LFG, which permit one to use a
value assigned elsewhere as an attribute (that is,
our proposal here is modelled on the use of (f
PCASE) = 4) in LFG.
We alter (11a) and (11b) so that the paths
that they constrain are sensitive to the value of
an attribute (which we call CTYPE):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99779975">
(13)
t) CTYPE) PRED FN) = sem form
(( t) (t CTYPE) SUBJ) =(T SUBJ))
t) (f CTYPE) OBJ) = OBJ))4
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9462805">
The value of CTYPE is given by the adverbial
annotations:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.85321925">
(14a)
on ADVP:
t ) I)
(t CTYPE) = ( TYPE)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.965839857142857">
4 Notice that all dependents of a head must be made
sensitive to the value of the CTYPE attribute (to main-
tain constructional integrity). To deal with non-
subcategorised constituents such as SADJs (whose
equations are given by c-structure rule) we must anno-
tate ADVP with: t (t SADJ) = t) (f CTYPE)
SADJ)
(14b)
on the adverb just:
TYPE = XCOMP)
Notice that the x annotation to ADVP (which
states that the translation of the containing f-
structure is the translation of the f-structure
associated with the ADVP (i.e. the SADJ slot))
simply equates the -E of two &amp;structures and
avoids the problem which beset the proposal in
Kaplan et al (1989). This can be seen from the
equation set for (2c) in (15). Note that when
there is no adverb, the value of ( t CrYPE)
must be E (since paths are regular expressions
((t t) ( e) GF) OT 1) GF)).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9996325">
(15)
((-t fl) PRED FN) = penser
(fl SUBJ)) = ((x fl) SUBJ)

£3) XCOMP SUBJ) = ( 13 SUBJ))
((t f4) PRED FN) = jean
et 13) = f5)
((t 15) PRED FN) = venir
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845727272727">
What is the cost of this proposal? The
translational correspondences in all lexical
entries will be sensitive in this way to the value
of the CTYPE feature. We most guarantee that
when a value is not contributed by the type
feature on the adverb, the value of ( t CTYPE)
is e, either by some priority union operation to
initialise it to E, or by some other convention
with this effect, or by assuming different ver-
sions of the c-structure rules (with VP contribut-
ing ( t CTYPE) = t) as appropriate.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.665465333333333">
• Variants of this solution which do not
exploit the path equation variable apparatus of
LFG are also possible, though at the cost of
massively increasing the size of the lexicon.
For example, lexical translation correspondences
could be disjunctions as in (16).

<bodyText confidence="0.973223307692308">
It remains to be seen whether one needs the
constraining condition to rule out unwanted
&apos;partial&apos; or &apos;extra&apos; translations, or whether one
can rely on completeness and coherence checks
on the target side.
Section 2.3.
Our third alternative involves giving the
path equations some sort of functional uncer-
tainty interpretation. Our starting point is the
problematic pair of equations repeated in (17)
and the observation that the required target
structure embeds the XCOMP within the
COMP.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.96998975">
(t (1 COMP)) = ((t t )COMP)
(-C (f3)) = ((t f1) COMP)

(t3)) = ((s f5) XCOMP)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.95800056">
The interpretation of the (t COMP)) = t)
COMP) could be loosened on the source side, as
in (18):
(t COMP GF)) = ((s t ) COMP)
(f3 GF)) = ((r fl) COMP)
which specifies that the translation of some f-
structure on a path from the source COMP (e.g.
the COMP SADJ) fills the COMP slot in the
translation. This avoids the problem in (17).
Equally, the interpretation could be loosened on
the target side:
(T COMP)) = ((r t) COMP GF)
(r(f3)) = ((t fl) COMP GF)-
which says that the translation of the COMP
fills some path from the COMP slot in the trans-
lation (e.g. the COMP XCOMP). This proposal
raises a number of interesting questions for
further research about whether functional uncer-
tainty can be used here while still guaranteeing
some determinate set of output structures to be
validated (or not) by the target grammar.
Notice however that for the case in hand, the
uncertainty equation can be quite specific - all
that is required is the source functional uncer-
tainty:

3. Conclusion.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953208333333">
Our starting point in this paper was the
observation that a treatment proposed for cases
such as (2) in Kaplan et al (1989) is unwork-
able. We have then discussed alternative
approaches available within the general model
assumed by Kaplan et al (1989). We have
shown that the problem is to achieve simple
general statements of the correspondence map-
ping which cover exceptional cases without
spreading the effect of exceptionality throughout
the grammar. The discussion in section 2 raises
intricate technical issues about the formalism
itself, but also relates to wider issues concerning
the modularity of the approach to translation
proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) as well as the
suitability and expressivity of the formalism,
raising serious questions about the feasibility of
a large MT system along these lines.
We also noted that these cases are
unproblematic in the &amp;quot;fusing&amp;quot; direction, for then
we do not run into problems with the func-
tionality of the t correspondence. In this direc-
tion, the &apos;special&apos; equations are within the lexi-
cal entry for venir:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7694975">
T SADJ PRED FN) = just
t) =(t U XCOMP))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.953649857142857">
Substituting variables for clarity, combining
these equations with the regular equation from
the embedding verb (penser) produces no incon-
sistency, since the path specifications sfl COMP
and sf5 can be equated:
(fl COMP) = fl) COMP) •
= f1) COMP)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.856248666666667">
f3) = CC (f3 XCOMP))
£3) = OD
(( 5) SADJ PRED FN) = just
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925">
This observation raises interesting questions
concerning the directionality assumed in Kaplan
et al (1989). It seems that the correct way to
view all this is that we have a system of
correspondences relating 4 structures (Source
and Target c and f structures). For a given set
of correspondences and a partially determined
Set of structures, three possibilities exist:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9855564">
• no solution can be found;
- 297 -
• a finite number of solutions can be found;
• an indeterminate and/or infinite number of
solutions can be found.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99970495">
We might expect therefore that a solution
may be found even if we state correspondences
in the French -&gt; English direction but supply
the partial determination from the English side
(that is, when English is source). The system for
translating in either direction would then be a
pair of monolingual grammars with a set of x
equations stated in the &amp;quot;fusing&amp;quot; direction (i.e. in
the French grammar). This is currently under
investigation.
Preliminary results suggest that this
approach will in fact cleanly overcome the
specific problem at hand. It has proved possible
to translate sentences (2b) and (2d) above from
Dutch to English using grammars and lexicons
in which x only appears in the English rules and
entries. But this work has in turned raised a
number of fundamental issues, some of which
apply not only to LFG but to any other attempt
at theory-based translation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9460964">
• Exactly what does the formal definition of
the &apos;translates&apos; relation look like, in LFG
or any other theory-based approach to
translation?
• Can this formal definition actually be
implemented? Existing approaches to
generation from f/s-structure in LFG are
too restrictive (Wedekind 1988), and our
current implementation over-compensates.
• Is the functional nature of correspon-
dences appropriate to the t family, or
would a relation be more appropriate? If
so, what would the theoretical and practi-
cal consequences be?
• What is the relation between strict
theory-based &apos;translation&apos; and translation
in the ordinary sense of the word? Is it
not likely that its applicability will in
practice be limited to closely related
language pairs?
• Is there a substantive difference between
the structures - and - correspondences
approach of LFG and the single - struc-
tured - sign approach of HPSG or UCG?
Translation seems a strenuous test.

Perhaps most important, however, the examples that Kaplan et al give suggest that the notation is both natural and expressive: natural, in the sense that adequate x relations can be stated on the basis of reasonable intuitive and well-motivated linguistic analyses; expressive, in the sense that it is powerful enough to describe some difficult translation problems in a straightforward way. In this paper we show that the notation is not as natural and expressive as it at first seems. We first show that the most natural analysis proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) cannot in fact cover the range of data for the translational phenomenon in question. These cases are important because these constructions represent a pervasive structural difference between languages which one wants to be able to deal with in a natural way. We then go on to discuss alternatives which depart from or extend the formalism - 293 - proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) in various respects, pointing out some directions for further research.

This proposal therefore lacks monolingual motivation and thus is not attractive as an approach to translation. Thirdly, the approach cannot be extended to the case discussed here. In this paper we focus on the alternative proposal, in which head-switching (or alternatively, splitting) is a z operation.&apos; Adverbs &apos;are taken to be f-structure SADJs. The x annotation to ADVP states that the x of the mother fstructure is the XCOMP of the x of the SADJ I Notice that a third possibility, not discussed in Kaplan et al (1989), involving a flat f-structure but treating the adverb as a semantic head at s-structure, simply means that the mapping problem we describe below arises in the monolingual mapping between f-structure and s-structure. slot (Kaplan et al&apos;s fig. 26):2 S-. NP ADVP VP (t SUBJ) = 1 (t SADJ)=I (t SADJ) XCOMP) = t) This has the effect of subordinating the translation of the f-structure which contains the SADJ to the translation of the SADJ itself. The lexical entries themselves contribute further x equations (following Kaplan et al&apos;s fig. 21): arrive: V (t PRED) = arrive&lt;SUBJ&gt; ((x t) PRED FN) = arrive</context>

It does not give a correct translation of the source string. In this section we have shown that the proposal as outlined in Kaplan et al (1989) does not produce an adequate analysis of these cases. The problem, which is not at first apparent, arises from the combination of the regular and irregular equations from the emphasised lines. Note that there is no problem stating this correspondence in the French -&gt; English direction (see below). Section 2.0. In this section we will briefly consider a number of altematives.3 To facilitate discussion, it is worth noting that the proposal in Kaplan et al (1989) involves basically three elements: (11a) a set of (regular) equations constraining both source and target: (t SUBJ)) = ((x t) SUBJ) (1</context>

To deal with nonsubcategorised constituents such as SADJs (whose equations are given by c-structure rule) we must annotate ADVP with: t (t SADJ) = t) (f CTYPE) SADJ) (14b) on the adverb just: TYPE = XCOMP) Notice that the x annotation to ADVP (which states that the translation of the containing fstructure is the translation of the f-structure associated with the ADVP (i.e. the SADJ slot)) simply equates the -E of two &amp;structures and avoids the problem which beset the proposal in Kaplan et al (1989). This can be seen from the equation set for (2c) in (15). Note that when there is no adverb, the value of ( t CrYPE) must be E (since paths are regular expressions ((t t) ( e) GF) OT 1) GF)).

This proposal raises a number of interesting questions for further research about whether functional uncertainty can be used here while still guaranteeing some determinate set of output structures to be validated (or not) by the target grammar. Notice however that for the case in hand, the uncertainty equation can be quite specific - all that is required is the source functional uncertainty: (s (t COMP SADJ)) = ) COMP) 3. Conclusion. Our starting point in this paper was the observation that a treatment proposed for cases such as (2) in Kaplan et al (1989) is unworkable. We have then discussed alternative approaches available within the general model assumed by Kaplan et al (1989). We have shown that the problem is to achieve simple general statements of the correspondence mapping which cover exceptional cases without spreading the effect of exceptionality throughout the grammar. The discussion in section 2 raises intricate technical issues about the formalism itself, but also relates to wider issues concerning the modularity of the approach to translation proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) as well as the suitability and expressivity of the formal</context>

It seems that the correct way to view all this is that we have a system of correspondences relating 4 structures (Source and Target c and f structures). For a given set of correspondences and a partially determined Set of structures, three possibilities exist: • no solution can be found; - 297 - • a finite number of solutions can be found; • an indeterminate and/or infinite number of solutions can be found. We might expect therefore that a solution may be found even if we state correspondences in the French -&gt; English direction but supply the partial determination from the English side (that</context>

But this work has in turned raised a number of fundamental issues, some of which apply not only to LFG but to any other attempt at theory-based translation: • Exactly what does the formal definition of the &apos;translates&apos; relation look like, in LFG or any other theory-based approach to translation? • Can this formal definition actually be implemented? Existing approaches to generation from f/s-structure in LFG are too restrictive (Wedekind 1988), and our current implementation over-compensates. • Is the functional nature of correspondences appropriate to the t family, or would a relation be more appropriate? If so, what would the theoretical and practical consequences be? • What is the relation between strict theory-based &apos;translation&apos; and translation in the ordinary sense of the word? Is it not likely that its applicability will in practice be limited to closely related language pairs? • Is there a substantive difference between the structures - and - correspondences approach of LFG and the single - structured - sign approach of HPS</context>

Thus (1) says that the translation of the value of the SUBJ slot in a source f-structure fills the SUBJ slot in the fstructure which is the translation of that source f-structure. What results is an interesting, and apparently extremely attractive approach to MT, which finds echoes in a good deal of recent work in MT and Computational Linguistics generally (van Noord et al (1990), Zajac (1990)). Among the apparent advantages are: that it avoids the problems that arise in traditional stratiflcational transfer systems where a variety of (often incompatible) kinds of information must be expressed in a single structure.
