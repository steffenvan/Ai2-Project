model of systemic grammar (to my knowledge the only
such formal model extant today). This model includes a
formal definition of the syntactic structures and hence
the sentences generated by the grammar. Realization
rules (the rules by which the set of features, computed
by the network traversal, are assembled into an English
sentence) are not fully treated, though an outline is
given of how they could be formulated in a first-order
sorted logic.
Chapter 6 describes the implementation of SLANG,
and Appendix B contains some sample sentences it
generated. Appendix A contains a tutorial of the 0P55
production language.
One serious shortcoming mars the overall message of
the book. This is the inadequate treatment of presen-
tential planning issues. It has become increasingly clear
over the last decade that realization—i.e., the formula-
tion of smallish chunks of information as individual
sentences—is but one half of the problem of generating
language, the small half at that. The other half involves
the collection and organization of material into such
chunks, a much less well-understood problem.
This is where the book disappoints. Patten&apos;s ap-
proach is to use the systemic notion of register—that is,
roughly, the characteristics of a particular interaction
between interlocutors, situated in time and place—to
control the problem-solver–generator by setting crucial
choice point values in the grammar network. This
operation is called preselection. Once these values have
been set, the remaining features are all fully determined
and the production rules take care of their collection.
Leaving aside the fact that Patten&apos;s interpretation of
register is highly controversial in systemic linguistics,
its use in the book significantly weakens the force of his
claims. Naturally, one expects an account of the pro-
cess of constructing various registers and of determin-
ing which points in the grammar registers should mini-
mally control (or if not, how one is to go about making
the remaining problem-solving decisions); one expects
to find if not a full theory of register, at least a
description of the theory underlying register. Almost no
such information is given; instead, appeal is made to
some text planner to construct, using information on the
&amp;quot;semantic stratum&amp;quot;, the appropriate values for prese-
lection of appropriate values. Fragments of examples of
semantic strata are given, one for a mother-child inter-
action and one, in an appendix, for a building task, but
many questions about their status remain unaddressed:
What is a semantic stratum? What information can it
contain? How complete are the given strata? Do all
mother-child interactions obey the given distinctions?
Of the thousands of other locutions with which the
mother could chastise and threaten, why are precisely
the given sentences generated? What would control
further variation? And so forth. The lack of develop-
ment of a notation with which to control generation—an
input notation, in some sense—is a serious shortcom-
ing.
The book&apos;s strong points are, therefore, its accessi-
ble introduction to systemic grammar, its demonstration
that a grammar can be implemented by production rules
and treated in a problem-solving paradigm, its formal
model of a systemic grammar, and the OPS5 tutorial.
The reader will come from the book having learned
something about all these matters, though not necessar-
ily convinced that it describes the best paradigm for
generation. Still, it is a valuable addition to any collec-
tion of books about the art of generating sentences by
computer.

INTEGRATED NATURAL LANGUAGE DIALOGUE: A COMPUTATIONAL

Frederking describes a prototype natural language interface
with two special features. First, the system is integrated in the
sense that all processing—syntactic, semantic, pragmatic—is
performed in the one module, written as a set of production
rules. Second, there is particular attention to the resolution of
elliptical utterances in the dialogue.
Frederking claims that &amp;quot;no other system can handle the
range of ellipsis phenomena&amp;quot; (p. 5) that his can, though this is
not backed up with any point-by-point comparison with other
research. For example, the extensive work of the Linguistic
String Project (e.g., Sager 1981; Sager, Friedman, and Lyman
1987) is never mentioned. It is also claimed that the system&apos;s
virtues &amp;quot;arise naturally from an approach that roughly corre-
sponds to models of human natural language processing&amp;quot; (p.
160), although there is no consideration of any psycholinguis-
tic models. Webber&apos;s (1978) work on verb-phrase ellipsis is
not discussed (though there is passing mention of her formal
approach to discourse representation); Frederking apparently
rejects Webber&apos;s conclusions as to what representations and
processes are required in VP ellipsis resolution but doesn&apos;t
say why.
The content of the book is Frederking&apos;s Ph.D. thesis from
Carnegie Mellon University, with only the addition of an
index and a change of title. (In the thesis title, &amp;quot;integrated&amp;quot;
qualified &amp;quot;model&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;dialogue&amp;quot;; the significance of the
change is unclear.) Only a small part of the book (20 pages)
discusses theoretical aspects of the work; the bulk concerns
details of the implementation in OPS5 (58 pages), and long
annotated traces of the program (54 pages), with introduction,
literature review, and conclusions taking the remaining space.
Thus conference or journal publication might have been more

These two collections exemplify opposite approaches to men-
tal representation and the question of how cognition relates to
language and reality. Eco, Santambrogio, and Violi start from
European semiotics and try to build a bridge to Anglo-
American philosophy of language and artificial intelligence.
Kempson, on the other hand, looks at current linguistic
theories, including GB and situation semantics, with a heavy
leaning towards relevance theory. The papers in the two
books are as follows:
