This book brings together
investigations from a variety of
disciplinary backgrounds to
examine how young children
acquire the vocabulary of their
native tongue with such rapidity,
and with virtually no errors along
the way.

The overriding theme in this book
is the notion that the availability
and syntactic positioning of
arguments is not a matter of
chance but arises from laws
governing the structure of lexical
entries and from laws governing
syntactic structures themselves.

Jindrich Toman
Driven by a desire to create a new
basis for the study of language, a
heterogeneous group of scholars
launched the influential Prague
Linguistic Circle in the mid-20s.
This book examines the historical
factors that produced the Circle,
the basic tenets that it promul-
gated, and, most important, the
social and cultural environment in
which the Circle flourished.

It is standardly assumed that
Universal Grammar (UG) allows a
given hierarchical representation
to be associated with more than
one linear order. The Antisymmetry
of Syntax proposes a restrictive
theory of word order and phrase
structure that denies this assump-

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982838">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.856146">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9972698125">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been
formed; others are likely to be added.
