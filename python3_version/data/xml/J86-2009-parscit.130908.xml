concentrated on the role of prior discourse, and has
developed a procedure that handles a wide variety of
noun phrase types, including pronouns and missing noun
phrases, using a focusing algorithm based on surface
syntactic structure (Dahl, submitted for publication).
NYU, as part of its work on the domain model, has devel-
oped a procedure that can identify a component in the
model from any of the noun phrases that can name that
component (Ksiezyk and Grishman, submitted for publi-
cation). After further development, these procedures will
be integrated into a comprehensive noun phrase semantic
analyzer.

4.5.3. TIME ANALYSIS (SDC)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999673571428572">
SDC has started to develop a module to process time
information. Sources of time information include verb
tense, adverbial time expressions, prepositional phrases,
co-ordinate and subordinate conjunctions. These are all
mapped into a small set of predicates expressing a partial
time ordering among the states and events in the
message.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.605321">
4.6. DOMAIN MODEL (NYU)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906222222222">
The domain model captures the detailed information
about the general class of equipment, and about the
specific pieces of equipment involved in the messages;
this information is needed in order to fully understand
the messages. The model integrates part/whole informa-
tion, type/instance links, and functional information
about the various components (Ksiezyk and Grishman,
submitted for publication).
The knowledge base performs several functions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997212222222222">
• It provides the domain-specific constraints needed for
the semantics to select the correct arguments for a
predicate, so that modifiers are correctly attached to
noun phrases.
• It enables noun phrase semantics to identify the correct
referent for a phrase.
• It provides the prototype information structures which
are instantiated in order to record the information in a
particular message.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997062222222222">
•It provides the information on equipment structure and
function used by the discourse rules in establishing
probable causal links between the sentences. And
finally, associated with the components in the know-
ledge base are procedures for graphically displaying the
status of the equipment as the message is interpreted.
These functions are performed by a large network of
frames implemented using the Symbolics Zetalisp flavors
system.

4.7. DISCOURSE ANALYSIS (NYU)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999564833333333">
The semantic analyzer generates separate semantic
representations for the individual sentences of the
message. For many applications it is important to estab-
lish the (normally implicit) intersentential relationships
between the sentences. This is performed by a set of
inference rules that (using the domain model) identify

plausible causal and enabling relationships among the
sentences. These relationships, once established, can
serve to resolve some semantic ambiguities. They can
also supplement the time information extracted during
semantic analysis and thus clarify temporal relations
among the sentences.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970883">
4.8. DIAGNOSTICS (NYU)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841125">
The diagnostic procedures are intended to localize the
cause of failure of the analysis and provide meaningful
feedback when some domain-specific constraint has been
violated. We are initially concentrating on violations of
local (selectional) constraints, and have built a small
component for diagnosing such violations and suggesting
acceptable sentence forms; later work will study more
global discourse constraints.

Kuwait University is currently compiling an extensive
bibliography in the areas of Computational Linguistics
and Artificial Intelligence. The bibliography is meant to
be of value particularly to universities and research
centers that, like KU, are planning to start research and
teaching in these areas. It will assist them to base their
planning on state-of-the-art information in the field and
to be aware of available resources.
The bibliography will include information on books,
journals, published papers, technical reports, educational
tools, and systems.
We would appreciate information on any of the above
categories, particularly on technical reports, tools for
research, and systems. Information on systems should
include: purpose of system, name(s) of designer(s), tech-
nical features, limitations, programming language, hard-
ware requirements, and availability for educational
institutions.
The bibliography will be published at the end of 1987.
It may also be available on line through the European
Academic Network.

ANNOUNCEMENTS
COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998779307692307">
Academic Press has announced this new journal, which
commenced publication in March 1986. The purpose of
the journal is to publish reports of original research
related to quantitative descriptions of the recognition,
understanding, production, and coding of speech by
humans and/or machines.
The speech sciences have a long history, but it is only
fairly recently that experimentation with complex models
of speech processes has become feasible. At present
such research is carried out somewhat separately by prac-
titioners of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science,
Electronic Engineering, Linguistics, Phonetics, and
Psychology. Appropriate areas of investigation include
the use of constructive mathematical analyses, computer
simulation, algorithms for pattern analysis, syntactic and
linguistic structures, the establishment of models of
human performance, and the use of computers in meas-
urements.
The journal will aim to provide a focus for this work
and to encourage an interdisciplinary approach to prob-
lems in the speech sciences. Thus, contributions from all
of the related disciplines will be welcomed in the form of
reports of theoretical or experimental studies, tutorials,
and brief correspondence pertaining to models of speech
communication and their implementation, or fundamental
research leading to the improvement of such models.
