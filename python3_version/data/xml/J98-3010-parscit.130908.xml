William Frawley&apos;s original and wide-ranging new book embraces linguistics, artificial
intelligence, philosophy, and psychology in seeking a reconciliation between contem-
porary cognitive science and Vygotskian psychology.
Lev Semenovich Vygotsky (1896-1934) was a Russian psychologist who founded
the sociocultural school of psychology, which is based upon the general law of cultural
development. This states that &amp;quot;Every function in the child&apos;s cultural development ap-
pears twice: first on the social level, and later, on the individual level: first, between
people (interpsychological), and then inside the child (intrapsychological)&amp;quot; (Vygotsky
1978, p. 57). The proposed link between the external, interpsychological activity and the
intrapsychological processes within the mind allows the internalization of the higher
mental processes from their social origins. This process of internalization is central to
Vygotsky&apos;s work and is focused upon within Frawley&apos;s book. Internalization is not
a simple &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;copying&amp;quot; process; the structure and functions of the process
change during its internalization and lead to the formation of an &amp;quot;internal plane of con-
sciousness&amp;quot; (Leont&apos;ev 1979). The individual&apos;s psychological functioning that emerges
from this process reflects the nature of the culture from which he or she was derived
(Rogoff and Wertsch 1984). The processes of social interaction that are the point of
contact between the intra- and the interpsychological activity are mediated by sign
systems such as language. Vygotsky places particular emphasis upon &amp;quot;inner speech,&amp;quot;
which is described as &amp;quot;thinking in pure meanings&amp;quot; (Vygotsky 1986), as opposed to the
embodiment of external speech in words. He describes it as a &amp;quot;distinct plane of verbal
thought,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;next plane&amp;quot; being thought itself (Vygotsky 1986). This process of inner
speech is also of central importance to the arguments presented in Frawley&apos;s work.
In order to understand the direction of Vygotsky&apos;s approach, it is also impor-
tant to recognize that sociocultural psychology is developmental. Children interact
with adults in a society within which a sign system is available and it is through
this mediated social interaction that internalization takes place. The emphasis upon
the internalization of culture via semiotic mediation suggests that the nature of the
relationship between learning and development is particularly interesting. Vygotsky
introduced his own approach to this relationship in the shape of the zone of proximal
development. This represents the crystallization of the internalization process, with
particular reference to the school-aged child, and describes the most fertile interactions
that occur between members of an educational culture and a learner. In addition to its
influence upon sociocultural psychology, Vygotsky&apos;s work is also at the heart of the
theoretical framework that has been built around the concept of activity in Soviet psy-
chology. This concept has subsequently been clarified and expanded by Leont&apos;ev (in

Leont&apos;ev [1978, 1979], for example). This approach views human activity as oriented
towards the satisfaction of an objective through goal-directed actions. Both the devel-
opmental approach of Vygotsky and his importance to activity theory are recognized
within Frawley&apos;s book, but neither form the central point of focus, which is reserved
for the process of internalization.
The emphasis that Vygotskians place upon the influence of external culture and
social interactivity to the nature of an individual&apos;s mental processes creates a tension
with the internalist accounts of mind that dominate contemporary cognitive science.
It is this tension that Frawley aims to diffuse in Vygotsky and Cognitive Science. The pro-
cess of internalization that is at the heart of the Vygotskian tradition is used to focus
attention on the role played by language at the boundary of mind and world. This
provides a common point of interest between Vygotskians and cognitive scientists.
Vygotsky and Cognitive Science is divided into two parts. In Part 1, the author presents
the foundations of his framework for a Vygotskian cognitive science, or sociocompu-
tationalism as it is later renamed. Part 2 presents an explicit integration of the views of
Vygotskians and cognitive scientists that is based upon this framework and is focused
upon subjectivity, control, and control disorders.
In Chapter 1, &amp;quot;Internalism and the ideology of cognitive science,&amp;quot; Frawley looks
at the internal-external clash over the direction of explanation in cognitive science.
He provides a sketch of the current state of play in the study of mind and suggests
that the internalist-externalist dichotomy currently driving cognitive science falsely
pits computationalism against socioculturalism. He suggests that a proper reading
of Vygotsky reveals discussions of the internalization process and control that are
consistent with both psychologists and computationalists.
Chapter 2, &amp;quot;From Plato&apos;s problem to Wittgenstein&apos;s problem,&amp;quot; offers a framework
for integrating externalism and internalism. Plato&apos;s problem, how do we know so much
from so little? is supplanted by Wittgenstein&apos;s problem, how do we manage both the
internal virtual machine and the external real machine? Plato&apos;s problem is central to
the study of the mind. In his answer, Plato suggests that exposure to the world of ideal
forms equips us with an inner system of universal truths. This is an internalist view
that doesn&apos;t fit well into a Vygotskian perspective. Wittgenstein&apos;s problem explores
units of mind that are neither wholly internal nor wholly external, and in this way
Wittgenstein addresses the process of internalization. Vygotsky is therefore presented
by Frawley as providing the empirical research program that Wittgenstein lacked,
and a social psychology of action becomes Vygotsky&apos;s answer. The application of this
answer can be seen in the ways that cognitive scientists and Vygotskians use language
to access the connections between the internal architecture of the mind and the external
context in which the mind operates. Thus Chapter 2 explores a framework, in the form
of Wittgenstein&apos;s problem, that deals with the clash of Chapter 1 as it forces cooperation
between computation and culture.
Chapter 3, &amp;quot;Architectures and contexts: Unifying computational and cultural psy-
cholinguistics,&amp;quot; argues for unity in terms of the relationship between context, which
is defined as &amp;quot;the setting for thought&amp;quot; (p. 108), and architecture, defined as the &amp;quot;inner
computational code&amp;quot; of the mind (p. 5). The study of these relationships in terms of
the way that language mediates between mind and world and, through the process
of internalization, leads to individual development allows Wittgenstein&apos;s problem to
be translated into the empirical arguments of social and computational accounts of
mind. This all sets the stage for a Vygotskian cognitive science focused upon three
aspects of mind: subjectivity, real-time operation (also referred to as implementation
or control), and breakdown or &amp;quot;control disorders.&amp;quot;

Chapter 4, &amp;quot;Subjectivity: Consciousness and metaconsciousness,&amp;quot; opens the second
part of the book. Consciousness is explored by computationalists and was also the
central issue for Vygotsky. This chapter is a good survey of the state of play with
regard to consciousness, its proponents and doubters. Both computational and social
approaches accept that there must be continuity of structure between lower mind and
consciousness. Subjectivity is presented as having three modes:

<listItem confidence="0.99919">
1. nonconscious processing (also referred to as nonconscious information
processing);
2. consciousness (also referred to as conscious awareness); and
3. metaconsciousness (also referred to as deliberate meta-thinking).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999437567567567">
These three modes are characterized by an assembly of overlapping properties cate-
gorized under the headings of structure, function, context, universality, and speed. This
chapter also contains three examples of cognitive science reinterpreted through a Vy-
gotskian perspective: external representations and distributed cognition, nonlogical
effects in inferencing and domain-specific thinking, and learning and teaching. These
examples are also used to emphasize Frawley&apos;s suggestion that a Vygotskian cogni-
tive science requires two mental languages: a language of thought and a language for
thought (speech for self-conscious thinking).
Chapter 5, &amp;quot;Control and the language for thought,&amp;quot; addresses the questions left
unanswered in Chapter 4: where in a computational mind is sociocultural subjectiv-
ity? and how is metaconsciousness implemented? The language for thought is defined
as &amp;quot;falsely dialogic signing for position that mediates thinking&amp;quot; (p. 178). Each of the
units in this definition is explored in turn. False dialogue is used to convey the view
that the language for thought involves the merging of speaker and listener. Signing is
used to indicate that speech is not the only sign system of the language for thought
and for position to emphasize the association between the individual self and linguis-
tic viewpoint. Mediates thinking emphasizes the instrumental nature of the language
for thought, which is not a further representational system at a higher level than the
language of thought. Current private-speech research is criticized as being too nar-
row, as Frawley returns to the promotion of a context-and-architecture view of the
language for thought. He uses various different language dialogue examples to argue
that a reflexive language will mediate context and code, meaning that a context-and-
architecture view will turn on the relative contextualization of self-referentiality. The
linguistic structure of the language for thought is considered from the perspective of
the meaning, form, and function of six linguistic phenomena: prediction, focus, evi-
dentiality, person, discourse markers, and metalinguistic markers. Their cross-cultural
differences, their early use by children, and their role in private speech are explored.
Chapter 6, &amp;quot;Control disorders: Splitting the computational from the social,&amp;quot; spells
out the principal lesson of the book so far: that the linguistic integration of compu-
tational and social mind depends upon the form and operation of the mind&apos;s control
language. A catalogue of control disorders is explored: Williams syndrome, Turner
syndrome, spina bifida with hydrocephalus, and autism. The linguistic deficits associ-
ated with these syndromes are presented as being disorders of knowledge as opposed
to deficits in resources. The latter might be compensated for by increasing the re-
sources available, but the disorders discussed in this chapter do not allow such a
bypass. Frawley suggests that a useful computational perspective on these disorders
represents them as interface management problems.

The Epilogue tries to address some of the questions that might come to mind
after reading the book. The defining feature of cognitive science is presented as the
pursuit of mind, requiring a &amp;quot;design-limitation account of computable representations&amp;quot;
(p. 261). This leads to the suggestion that a Vygotskian cognitive science (sociocom-
putationalism) is an explanation of the &amp;quot;design of higher thought compatible with
both sociocultural knowledge and external to mind and internally computed repre-
sentations&amp;quot; (p. 262). It is described as a claim about how the world is in the mind
by means of certain features of language and an account of computationally effective
sociocultural information.
Vygotsky and Cognitive Science is an interesting and somewhat unexpected explo-
ration into the power that can be gained when one steps back and reviews apparently
conflicting theories to note that there are points of contact that can provide a much
stronger approach to the same set of problems and issues being considered by each
school of thought in isolation. It is certainly different from the other texts that use
Vygotsky (Newman and Holzman [1993], Wertsch [1985a, 1985b], for example); nev-
ertheless, it tackles difficult subject matter in a clear and concise manner. By trying to
provide an implementable sociocognitive account of metaconsciousness, Frawley bites
the bullet and attempts a difficult maneuver in which all hand-waving vagueness is
out of bounds. Frawley observes that cognitive science and the Vygotskian approach
each have something that the other lacks, and each can be read in terms of the other.
The important cover terms Vygotsky, computational, internalism, and externalism are all
defined very broadly, which results in wide-ranging discussions. However, there is
differentiation within this breadth. Vygotskian accounts of the mind in context that
do not provide a theory of the inside (Lave and Wenger [1991], for example) are not
encompassed by Frawley&apos;s definition of Vygotskian; they are missing the opportunity
to explore an implementable theory of mind: this is the computationalist&apos;s strength.
The book&apos;s discussion is presented clearly, and is written with authority and with
relevant connections to the surrounding arguments and narrative. A diverse range
of examples is frequently used for support. This includes puzzles such as Mission-
aries and Cannibals and Tower of Hanoi, dialogue analysis, programming in C and
Pascal, and clinical defectology, to cite but a few. The overview flavor of the frame-
work outlined in Part 1 is complemented by the concentration upon three points
of focus—subjectivity, control, and breakdown—which provides an opportunity for
more-detailed explorations in Part 2.
Frawley admits at the outset that his interest in Vygotsky&apos;s work is restricted to
the internalization process as opposed to the theory of development. This selective
treatment makes it difficult to judge who might find the book appropriate or useful.
It certainly is not a detailed account of Vygotsky&apos;s work in relation to theory of mind
or computational linguistics. It is an exploration into the energizing counterpoint that
can result when apparently inconsistent approaches are viewed in a conciliatory way.
It argues for the mediation of internal and external worlds using thought through
language.

Lev Semenovich Vygotsky (1896-1934) was a Russian psychologist who founded sociocultural school of psychology, which is based upon law of cultural states that &amp;quot;Every function in the child&apos;s cultural development appears twice: first on the social level, and later, on the individual level: first, between people (interpsychological), and then inside the child (intrapsychological)&amp;quot; (Vygotsky p. 57). The proposed link between the external, and within the mind allows the internalization of the higher mental processes from their social origins. This process of internalization is central to Vygotsky&apos;s work and is focused upon within Frawley&apos;s book.

The individual&apos;s psychological functioning that emerges from this process reflects the nature of the culture from which he or she was derived (Rogoff and Wertsch 1984). The processes of social interaction that are the point of between the intraand activity are mediated by sign systems such as language.

This process of internalization is central to Vygotsky&apos;s work and is focused upon within Frawley&apos;s book. Internalization is not a simple &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;copying&amp;quot; process; the structure and functions of the process change during its internalization and lead to the formation of an &amp;quot;internal plane of consciousness&amp;quot; (Leont&apos;ev 1979). The individual&apos;s psychological functioning that emerges from this process reflects the nature of the culture from which he or she was derived (Rogoff and Wertsch 1984). The processes of social interaction that are the point of contact between the intra- and the interpsychological activity are mediated by sign systems such as language.

Lev Semenovich Vygotsky (1896-1934) was a Russian psychologist who founded the sociocultural school of psychology, which is based upon the general law of cultural development. This states that &amp;quot;Every function in the child&apos;s cultural development appears twice: first on the social level, and later, on the individual level: first, between people (interpsychological), and then inside the child (intrapsychological)&amp;quot; (Vygotsky 1978, p. 57). The proposed link between the external, interpsychological activity and the intrapsychological processes within the mind allows the internalization of the higher mental processes from their social origins. This process of internalization is central to Vygotsky&apos;s work and is focused upon within Frawley&apos;s book.

He describes it as a &amp;quot;distinct plane of verbal thought,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;next plane&amp;quot; being thought itself (Vygotsky 1986). This process of inner speech is also of central importance to the arguments presented in Frawley&apos;s work. In order to understand the direction of Vygotsky&apos;s approach, it is also important to recognize that sociocultural psychology is developmental. Children interact with adults in a society within which a sign system is available and it is through this mediated social interaction that internalization takes place. The emphasis</context>
