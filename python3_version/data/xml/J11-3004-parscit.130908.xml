We introduce dependency parsing schemata, a formal framework based on Sikkel’s parsing
schemata for constituency parsers, which can be used to describe, analyze, and compare depen-
dency parsing algorithms. We use this framework to describe several well-known projective and
non-projective dependency parsers, build correctness proofs, and establish formal relationships
between them. We then use the framework to define new polynomial-time parsing algorithms
for various mildly non-projective dependency formalisms, including well-nested structures with
their gap degree bounded by a constant k in time O(n5+2k), and a new class that includes all
gap degree k structures present in several natural language treebanks (which we call mildly
ill-nested structures for gap degree k) in time O(n4+3k). Finally, we illustrate how the parsing
schema framework can be applied to Link Grammar, a dependency-related formalism.

Dependency parsing involves finding the structure of a sentence as expressed by a set
of directed links (called dependencies) between individual words. Dependency for-
malisms have attracted considerable interest in recent years, having been successfully
applied to tasks such as machine translation (Ding and Palmer 2005; Shen, Xu, and
Weischedel 2008), textual entailment recognition (Herrera, Pe˜nas, and Verdejo 2005),
relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen 2004; Fundel, K¨uffner, and Zimmer 2006),
and question answering (Cui et al. 2005). Key characteristics of the dependency parsing
approach are that dependency structures specify head–modifier and head–complement
relationships, which form the basis of predicate–argument structure, but are not rep-
resented explicitly in constituency trees; there is no need for dependency parsers to
postulate the existence of non-lexical nodes; and some variants of dependency parsers

tant when parsing free word order languages where discontinuous constituents are
common.
The formalism of parsing schemata, introduced by Sikkel (1997), is a useful tool for
the study of constituency parsers, supporting precise, high-level descriptions of parsing
algorithms. Potential applications of parsing schemata include devising correctness
proofs, extending our understanding of relationships between different algorithms,
deriving new variants of existing algorithms, and obtaining efficient implementations
automatically (G´omez-Rodr´ıguez, Vilares, and Alonso 2009). The formalism was origi-
nally defined for context-free grammars (CFG) and since then has been applied to other
constituency-based formalisms, such as tree-adjoining grammars (Alonso et al. 1999).
This article considers the application of parsing schemata to the task of dependency
parsing. The contributions of this article are as follows.

<listItem confidence="0.988421">
• We introduce dependency parsing schemata, a novel adaptation of the
original parsing schemata framework (see Section 2).
• We use the dependency parsing schemata to define and compare a number
of existing dependency parsers (projective parsers are presented in
Section 3, and their formal properties discussed in Sections 4 and 5; a
number of non-projective parsers are presented in Section 6).
• We present parsing algorithms for several sets of mildly non-projective
dependency structures, including a parser for a new class of structures we
call mildly ill-nested, which encompasses all the structures in a number of
existing dependency treebanks (see Section 7).
• We adapt the dependency parsing schema framework to the formalism of
Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley 1991, 1993) (see Section 8).

Although some of these contributions have been published previously, this article
presents them in a thorough and consistent way. The definition of dependency parsing
schemata was first published by G´omez-Rodrfguez, Carroll, and Weir (2008), along with
some of the projective schemata presented here and their associated proofs. The results
concerning mildly non-projective parsing in Section 7 were first published by G´omez-
Rodrfguez, Weir, and Carroll (2008, 2009). On the other hand, the material on Nivre
and Covington’s projective parsers, as well as all the non-projective parsers and the
application of the formalism to Link Grammar, are entirely new contributions of this
article.
The notion of a parsing schema comes from considering parsing as a deduction
process which generates intermediate results called items. In particular, items in parsing
schemata are sets of partial constituency trees taken from the set of all partial parse
trees that do not violate the constraints imposed by a grammar. A parsing schema can
be used to obtain a working implementation of a parser by using deductive engines
such as the ones described by Shieber et al. (1995) and G´omez-Rodrfguez, Vilares, and
Alonso (2009), or the Dyna language (Eisner, Goldlust, and Smith 2005).

a suitable definition of the set of structures contained in items, and a way to define
deduction steps that captures the formalism’s composition rules (Alonso et al. 1999).
Although it is less clear how to adapt parsing schemata to dependency parsing, a num-
ber of dependency parsers have the key property of being constructive: They proceed by
combining smaller structures to form larger ones, terminating when a complete parse
for the input sentence is found. We show that this makes it possible to define a variant
of the traditional parsing schemata framework, where the encodings of intermediate
dependency structures are defined as items, and the operations used to combine them
are expressed as inference rules. We begin by addressing a number of preliminary
issues.
Traditional parsing schemata are used to define grammar-driven parsers, in which
the parsing process is guided by some set of rules which are used to license deduction
steps. For example, an Earley PREDICTOR step is tied to a particular grammar rule, and
can only be executed if such a rule exists. Some dependency parsers are also grammar-
driven. For example, those described by Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), Barbero et al.
(1998), and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of depen-
dency grammar CFG-like rules described by Hays (1964) and Gaifman (1965). However,
many of the algorithms (Eisner 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003) are not traditionally
considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar;
decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilis-
tic models (Eisner 1996) or classifiers (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003). These are called
data-driven parsers. To express such algorithms as deduction systems, we use the
notion of D-rules (Covington 1990). D-rules have the form (a, i) → (b, j), which speci-
fies that a word b located at position j in the input string can have the word a in
position i as a dependent. Deduction steps in data-driven parsers can be associated with
the D-rules corresponding to the links they create, so that parsing schemata for such
parsers are defined using grammars of D-rules. In this way, we obtain a representation
of some of the declarative aspects of these parsing strategies that is independent of the
particular model used to make the decisions associated with each D-rule. Note that
this representation is useful for designing control structures or probabilistic models for
the parsers, because it makes explicit the choice points where the models will have
to make probabilistic decisions, as well as the information available at each of those
choice points. Additionally, D-rules allow us to use an uniform description that is valid
for both data-driven and grammar-driven parsers, because D-rules can function like
grammatical rules.
The fundamental structures in dependency parsing are dependency trees. There-
fore, just as items for constituency parsers encode sets of partial constituency trees,
items for dependency parsers can be defined using partial dependency trees. How-
ever, dependency trees cannot express the fact that a particular structure has been
predicted, but not yet built; this is required for grammar-based algorithms such as
those of Lombardo and Lesmo (1996) and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998). The
formalism can be made general enough to include these parsers by using a novel way of
representing intermediate states of dependency parsers based on a form of dependency
trees that include nodes labelled with preterminals and terminals (G´omez-Rodr´ıguez,
Carroll, and Weir 2008; G´omez-Rodr´ıguez 2009). For simplicity of presentation, we will
only use this representation (called extended dependency trees) in the grammar-based
algorithms that need it, and we will define the formalism and the rest of the algo-
rithms with simple dependency trees. Some existing dependency parsing algorithms,
for example, the algorithm of Eisner (1996), involve steps that connect spans which
can represent disconnected dependency graphs. Such spans cannot be represented by

partial dependency trees, rather than sets of trees.
We are now ready to define the concepts needed to specify item sets for dependency
parsers.

An interval (with endpoints i and j) is a set of natural numbers of the form [i..j] = {k |
i ≤ k ≤ j}. We will use the notation i..j for the ordered list of the numbers in [i..j]. A
dependency graph for a string w = w1 ... wn is a graph G = (V, E), where V ⊆ [1..n]
and E ⊆ V × V.
The edge (i,j) is written i → j, and each such edge is called a dependency link,
encoding the fact that the word wi is a syntactic dependent (or child) of wj or, conversely,
that wj is the parent, governor, or head of wi. We write i →* j to denote that there exists
a (possibly empty) path from i to j. The projection of a node i, denoted Li], is the set of
reflexive-transitive dependents of i, that is, Li] = {j ∈ V  |j →* i}. In contexts where we
refer to different dependency graphs, we use the notation LilG to specify the projection
of a node i in the graph G.

A dependency graph T for a string w1 ... wn is called a dependency tree for that string

a dependency tree T, denoted yield(T), is the ordered list of its nodes. We will use the
term dependency forest to refer to a set of dependency trees for the same string,1 and
the generic term dependency structure to refer to a dependency tree or forest.

Let δ(G) be the set of dependency trees which are syntactically well-formed according
to a given grammar G (which may be a grammar of D-rules or of CFG-like rules, as
explained previously). We define an item set for dependency parsing as a set I ⊆ H,
where H is a partition of the power set, (δ(G)), of the set δ(G). Each element of I,
called an item, is a set of dependency forests for strings. For example, each member of
the item [1,5] in the item set of the parser by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) that will
be explained in Section 3.4 is a dependency forest with two projective trees, one with
head 1 and the other with head 5, and such that the concatenation of their yields is 1..5.
Figure 1 shows the three dependency forests that constitute the contents of this item
under a specific grammar of D-rules.
Following Sikkel (1997), items are sets of syntactic structures and tuples are a short-
hand notation for such sets, as seen in the previous example. An alternative approach,

tree for a string w1 ... wn can be any subset of [1..n]. In fact, all the forests used by the parsers in this
article contain trees with non-overlapping yields, although this is not required by the definition.

(w4,4) —+ (w5,5)}.
following Shieber, Schabes, and Pereira (1995), would be to define items as tuples
that denote sets of syntactic structures. Although the latter approach provides more
flexibility, this makes defining the relationships between parsers less straightforward.
In any case, because tuple notation is used to write schemata under both approaches,
the schemata we provide are compatible with both interpretations.
Having defined an item set for dependency parsing, the remaining definitions are
analogous to those in Sikkel’s theory of constituency parsing (Sikkel 1997), and are not
presented in full detail. A dependency parsing system is a deduction system (Z, H, D)
where Z is a dependency item set as defined here, H is a set containing initial items
or hypotheses (not necessarily contained in Z), and D C_ ( (H U Z) x Z) is a set of
deduction steps defining an inference relation �-.
Final items in this formalism will be those containing some forest F containing a
parse tree for some string w1 ... wn. In parsers for general non-projective structures, any
item containing such a tree will be called a coherent final item for w1 ... wn. In schemata
for parsers that are constrained to a more restrictive class T of dependency trees, such as
projective parsers, coherent final items will be those containing parse trees for w1 ... wn
that are in T. For example, because we expect correct projective parsers to produce only
projective structures, coherent final items for projective parsers will be those containing
projective parse trees for w1 ... wn. Correctness proofs typically define a set of coherent
items, such that its intersection with final items produces the set of coherent final items.
The definition of coherent items depends on each particular proof.2
For each input string, a parsing schema’s deduction steps allow us to infer a set of
items, called derivable items, for that string.3 A parsing schema is said to be sound if all
derivable final items it produces for any arbitrary string are coherent for that string. A
parsing schema is said to be complete if all coherent final items are derivable. A correct
parsing schema is one which is both sound and complete.
Parsing schemata are located at a higher abstraction level than parsing algorithms,
and formalize declarative aspects of their logic: A parsing schema specifies a set of
intermediate results that are obtained by the algorithm (items) and a set of operations
that can be used to obtain new such results from existing ones (deduction steps); but it
makes no claim about the order in which to execute the operations or the data structures
to use for storing the results.

3.1 Collins (1996)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99795096">
One of the most straightforward projective dependency parsing strategies was intro-
duced by Collins (1996), and is based on the CYK bottom–up parsing strategy (Kasami
1965; Younger 1967). Collins’s parser works with dependency trees which are linked to
each other by creating links between their heads. The schema for this parser maps every
set of D-rules G and input string w1 ... wn to an instantiated dependency parsing system
(ZCol96, R, DCol96) such that:
Item set: The item set is defined as ZCol96 = {[i, j, h]  |1 &lt; i &lt; h &lt; j &lt; n}, where item [i, j, h]
is defined as the set of forests containing a single projective dependency tree T of b(G)
such that yield(T) is of the form i..j and head(T) = h (see Figure 2, left side). From now
on, we will implicitly assume that the dependency trees appearing in items of a parsing
schema for a grammar G are taken from the set b(G) of syntactically well-formed trees
according to G.
This means that Collins’s parser will be able to infer an item [i, j, h] in the presence
of an input string w1 ... wn if, using our set of D-rules, it is possible to build a projective
dependency tree headed at h that spans the substring wi ... wj of the input.
Hypotheses: For an input string w1 ... wn, the set of hypotheses is R = {[i, i, i]  |0 &lt; i &lt;
n + 1}, where each item contains a forest with a single dependency tree having only
one node i. This same set of hypotheses is used for all the parsers, so is not repeated
for subsequent schemata.4 Note that the nodes 0 and n + 1 used in the definition do not
correspond to actual input words—these are dummy nodes that we call beginning-of-
sentence and end-of-sentence markers, respectively, and will be needed by several of
the parsers described subsequently.
Final items: The set of final items is {[1, n, h]  |1 &lt; h &lt; n}. These items trivially represent
parse trees for the input sentence whose head is some node h, expressing that the word
wh is the sentence’s syntactic head.

<footnote confidence="0.97235">
4 Although in the parsers described in Section 7 we use a different notation for the hypotheses, they still
are the same, as explained later.

allowing us to join two contiguous trees by linking their heads with a rightward or
leftward link, respectively. Figure 2 (right side) shows a graphical representation of
how trees are joined by the L-LINK step. Note that, because this parsing strategy is
data-driven, D-rules are used as side conditions for the parser’s deduction steps. Side
conditions restrict the inference relation by specifying which combinations of values are
permissible for the variables appearing in the antecedents and consequent of deduction
steps.
This parsing schema specifies a recognizer: Given a set of D-rules and an input
string w1 ... wn, the sentence can be parsed (projectively) under those D-rules if and
only if the deduction system infers a coherent final item. When executing this schema
with a deductive engine, the parse forest can be recovered by following back pointers,
as in constituency parsers (Billot and Lang 1989).
This schema formalizes a parsing logic which is independent of the order and the
way linking decisions are taken. Statistical models can be used to determine whether
a step linking words a and b in positions i and j—i.e., having (a, i) -4 (b, j) as a side
condition—is executed or not, and probabilities can be attached to items in order to as-
sign different weights to different analyses of the sentence. The side conditions provide
an explicit representation of the choice points where probabilistic decisions are made by
the control mechanism that is executing the schema. The same principle applies to all
D-rule-based parsers described in this article.

3.2 Eisner (1996)

<bodyText confidence="0.966994">
Based on the number of free variables used in deduction steps of Collins’s parser, it is
apparent that its time complexity is O(n5): There are O(n5) combinations of index values
with which each of its LINK steps can be executed.5 This complexity arises because a
parentless word (head) may appear in any position in the items generated by the parser;
the complexity can be reduced to O(n3) by ensuring that parentless words only appear
at the first or last position of an item. This is the idea behind the parser defined by
Eisner (1996), which is still in wide use today (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005;
Corston-Oliver et al. 2006). The parsing schema for this algorithm is defined as follows.

is some k (i &lt; k &lt; j) such that yield(T1) = i..k and yield(T2) = k + 1..j.
The flags b, c in [i, j, b, c] indicate whether the nodes i and j, respectively, have a
parent in the item. Items with one of the flags set to True represent dependency trees
where the node i or j is the head, whereas items with both flags set to False represent
pairs of trees headed at nodes i and j which jointly dominate the substring wi ... wj.
Items of this kind correspond to disconnected dependency graphs.

where the R-LINK and L-LINK steps establish a dependency link between the heads of
an item containing two trees (i.e., having both flags set to False), producing a new item
containing a single tree. The COMBINESPANS step is used to join two items that overlap
at a single word, which must have a parent in only one of the items, so that the result
of joining trees coming from both items (without creating any dependency link) is a
well-formed dependency tree.
Final items: The set of final items is {[0, n, False, True]}. Note that these items represent de-
pendency trees rooted at the beginning-of-sentence marker 0, which acts as a “dummy
head” for the sentence. In order for the algorithm to parse sentences correctly, we need
to define D-rules to allow the real sentence head to be linked to the node 0.

G´omez-Rodriguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata
where LINK steps create a dependency link between two dependency trees spanning
adjacent segments of the input, and COMBINER steps join two overlapping trees by a
graph union operation that does not create new links. COMBINER steps follow the same
mechanism as those in the algorithm of Eisner (1996), and LINK steps work analogously
to those of Collins (1996), so this schema can be seen as being intermediate between
those two algorithms. These relationships will be formally described in Section 4.
Final items: The set of final items is {[0,n,0]}. By convention, parse trees have the
beginning-of-sentence marker 0 as their head, as in the previous algorithm.
When described for head automaton grammars (Eisner and Satta 1999), this algo-
rithm appears to be more complex to understand and implement than the previous
one, requiring four different kinds of items to keep track of the state of the automata
used by the grammars. However, this abstract representation of its underlying seman-
tics reveals that this parsing strategy is, in fact, conceptually simpler for dependency
parsing.

Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) define a deterministic, shift-reduce dependency parser
guided by support vector machines, which achieves over 90% dependency accuracy on
Section 23 of the Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank. Parsing schemata cannot specify
control strategies that guide deterministic parsers; schemata work at an abstraction
level, defining a set of operations without procedural constraints on the order in
which they are applied. However, deterministic parsers can be viewed as optimizations
of underlying nondeterministic algorithms, and we can represent the actions of the
underlying parser as deduction steps, abstracting away from the deterministic im-
plementation details, obtaining a potentially interesting nondeterministic dependency
parser.
Actions in Yamada and Matsumoto’s parser create links between two target nodes,
which act as heads of neighboring dependency trees. One of the actions creates a link
where the left target node becomes a child of the right one, and the head of a tree
located directly to the left of the target nodes becomes the new left target node. The
other action is symmetric, performing the same operation with a right-to-left link. An
O(n3) nondeterministic parser generalizing this behavior can be defined as follows.
Item set: The item set is IYM03 = {[i,j]  |0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n + 1}, where each item [i, j] corre-
sponds to the item [i, j, False, False] in IEis96.
Deduction steps: The deduction steps are as follows:
INITTER: [i, i, i] [i,j] [i, j]
[i + 1, i + 1, i + 1] [j, k] [j, k]
R-LINK: [i, k] (wj, j) → (wk, k) L-LINK: [i, k] (wj,j) → (wi,i)
[i, i + 1]
where a LINK step joins a pair of items containing forests with two trees each and
overlapping at a head node, and creates a dependency link from their common head to
one of the peripheral heads. Note that this is analogous to performing an Eisner LINK
step immediately followed by an Eisner COMBINE step, as will be further analyzed in
Section 4.
Final items: The set of final items is {[0, n + 1]}. For this set to be well-defined, the
grammar must not have D-rules of the form (wi, i) → (wn+1, n + 1), that is, it must not

condition, it is trivial to see that every forest in an item of the form [0, n + 1] must contain

As can be seen from the schema, this algorithm requires less bookkeeping than the

3.5 Lombardo and Lesmo (1996) and Other Earley-Based Parsers

<bodyText confidence="0.999937636363636">
The algorithms presented so far are based on making individual decisions about de-
pendency links, represented by D-rules. Other parsers, such as that of Lombardo and
Lesmo (1996), use grammars with CFG-like rules which encode the preferred order of
dependents for each given governor. For example, a rule of the form N(Det * PP) is used
to allow N to have Det as left dependent and PP as right dependent. The algorithm
by Lombardo and Lesmo is a version of Earley’s CFG parser (Earley 1970) that uses
Gaifman’s dependency grammar (Gaifman 1965).
As this algorithm predicts dependency relations before building them, item sets
contain extended dependency trees, trees that have two kinds of nodes: preterminal
nodes and terminal nodes. Depending on whether all the preterminal nodes have been
linked to terminals, extended dependency trees can either be grounded, in which case
they are isomorphic to traditional dependency graphs (see Figure 3), or ungrounded, as
in Figure 4, in which case they capture parser states in which some structure has been
predicted, but not yet found. Note that a dependency graph can always be extracted
from such a tree, but in the ungrounded case different extended trees can be associated
with the same graph. G´omez-Rodr´ıguez, Carroll, and Weir (2008) present extended
dependency trees in more detail.
Item set: The item set is ZLomLes = I[A(α • β), i, j] I A(αβ) E P ∧ 1 &lt; i &lt; j + 1 &lt; n} where
α and β are strings; P is a set of CFG-like rules;7 and each item [A(α • β), i, j] represents
the set of projective extended dependency trees rooted at A, where the direct children of
A are αβ, and the subtrees rooted at α have yield i..j. Note that Lombardo and Lesmo’s

example, the SCANNER always moves the dot over the head symbol *, rather than
over a terminal symbol). Analogously, other dependency parsing schemata based on
CFG-like rules can be obtained by modifying CFG parsing schemata of Sikkel (1997):
The algorithm of Barbero et al. (1998) can be obtained from the left-corner parser, and
the parser described by Courtin and Genthial (1998) is a variant of the head-corner

Nivre (2003) describes a shift-reduce algorithm for projective dependency parsing,
later extended by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004). With linear-time performance and
competitive parsing accuracy (Nivre et al. 2006; Nivre and McDonald 2008), it is one
of the parsers included in the MaltParser system (Nivre et al. 2007), which is currently
widely used (e.g., Nivre et al. 2007; Surdeanu et al. 2008).
The parser proceeds by reading the sentence from left to right, using a stack and four
different kinds of transitions between configurations. The transition system defined by
all the possible configurations and transitions is nondeterministic, and machine learning
techniques are used to train a mechanism that produces a deterministic parser.
A deduction system describing the transitions of the parser is defined by Nivre,

This set of inference rules is not a parsing schema, however, because the entities it
works with are not items. Although the antecedents and consequents in this deduction
system are parser configurations, they do not correspond to disjoint sets of dependency
structures (several configurations may correspond to the same dependency structures),
and therefore do not conform to the definition of an item set. It would be possible
to define parsing schemata in a different way with a weaker definition of item sets
allowing these configurations as items, but this would make it harder to formalize
relations between parsers, because they rely on the properties of item sets.
A parsing schema for Nivre’s parser can be obtained by abstracting away the
rules in the system that are implementing control structures, however, and expressing
only declarative aspects of the parser’s tree building logic. To do this, we first obtain
a simplified version of the deduction system. This version of the parser is obtained
by storing an index f rather than the full buffer βf in each configuration, and then
grouping configurations that share common features, making them equivalent for the
side conditions of the system: Instead of storing the full set of dependency links that the
algorithm has constructed up to a given point (denoted by V), we only keep track of
whether elements in the stack have been assigned a head or not; and we represent this
by using a stack of pairs (l, b), where l is the position of a word in the string and b is a
flag which is True if the corresponding node has been assigned a head or False if it has
not:

To obtain a parsing schema from this deduction system, we retain only rules per-
taining to the way in which the parser joins dependency structures and builds links
between them. In particular, the Reduce step is just a mechanism to select which of a set
of possible “linkable words” to link to the word currently being read. Two different
configurations corresponding to the same dependency structure may have different
lists of words in the stack depending on which Reduce steps have been executed. In
the parsing schema, these configurations must correspond to the same item, as they
involve the same dependency structures. To define an item set for this parser, we must
establish which words could be on the stack at each configuration.

decide which node to choose as a head of the one corresponding to the currently-read
word, we allow any node in the list that does not have a headless node to its right to
be the head; this is equivalent to performing several Reduce transitions followed by an
L-link transition.

Covington (2001) defines a non-projective dependency parser, and a projective vari-
ant called Algorithm LSUP (for List-based Search with Uniqueness and Projectivity).
Unfortunately, the algorithm presented in Covington (2001) is not complete: It does
not parse all projective dependency structures, because when creating leftward links
it assumes that the head of a node i must be a reflexive-transitive head of the node i − 1,
which is not always the case. For instance, the structure shown in Figure 5 cannot be
parsed because the constraints imposed by the algorithm prevent it from finding the
head of 4.
The MaltParser system (Nivre et al. 2007) includes an implementation of a complete
variant of Covington’s LSUP parser where these constraints have been relaxed. This
implementation has the same tree building logic as the parser described by Nivre (2003),
differing from it only with respect to the control structure. Thus, it can be seen as a
different realization of the schema shown in Section 3.6.

It is easy to see from the schema definitions that IYM03 ⊆ IEis96. We must verify that
every deduction step in the Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) schema can be emulated by
a sequence of inferences in the Eisner (1996) schema. For the INITTER step this is trivial

Theorem 2
Eisner and Satta (1999) sr�-4 Eisner (1996).

[i, j, False, True] [j + 1, k, True, False]
R-LINK: (wi,i) -4 (wk, k)

This inference can be emulated in Eisner’s parser as follows:

[i, j, False, True], [j, j + 1, False, False] �- [i, j + 1, False, False] (by COMBINESPANS)

<bodyText confidence="0.999963413793103">
The proof corresponding to the L-LINK step is symmetric. As for the R-COMBINER and
L-COMBINER steps in Eisner and Satta’s parser, it is easy to see that they are particular
cases of the COMBINESPANS step in Eisner’s, and therefore can be emulated by a single
application of COMBINESPANS. ■
Note that, in practice, these two relations mean that the parsers by Eisner and Satta
(1999) and Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) are more efficient, at the schema level, than
that of Eisner (1996), in that they generate fewer items and need fewer steps to perform
the same deductions. These two parsers also have the interesting property that they
use disjoint item sets (one uses items representing trees while the other uses items
representing pairs of trees); and the union of these disjoint sets is the item set used
by Eisner’s parser. The optimization in Yamada and Matsumoto’s parser comes from
contracting deductions in Eisner’s parser so that linking operations are immediately
followed by combining operations; whereas Eisner and Satta’s parser does the opposite,
forcing combining operations to be followed by linking operations.
By generalizing the linking steps in Eisner and Satta’s parser so that the head of
each item can be in any position, we obtain an O(n5) parser which can be filtered into
the parser of Collins (1996) by eliminating the COMBINER steps. From Collins’s parser,
we obtain an O(n5) head-corner parser based on CFG-like rules by an item refinement
in which each Collins item [i, j, h] is split into a set of items [A(α • R • γ), i, j, h]. The
refinement relation between these parsers only holds if for every D-rule B - 4A there is
a corresponding CFG-like rule A -4 ... B ... in the grammar used by the head-corner
parser. Although this parser uses three indices i, j, h, using CFG-like rules to guide link-
ing decisions makes the h indices redundant. This simplification is an item contraction
which results in an O(n3) head-corner parser. From here, we can follow the procedure
described by Sikkel (1994) to relate this head-corner algorithm to parsers analogous
to other algorithms for CFGs. In this way, we can refine the head-corner parser to a
variant of the algorithm by de Vreught and Honig (1989) (Sikkel 1997), and by successive
filters we reach a left-corner parser which is equivalent to the one described by Barbero
et al. (1998), and a step contraction of the Earley-based dependency parser by Lombardo

1997). These dependency parsing schemata are versions of the homonymous schemata
whose complete description can be found in Sikkel (1997), adapted for dependency
parsing. G´omez-Rodr´ıguez (2009) gives a more thorough explanation of these relations

5. Proving Correctness
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988252625">
Another use of the parsing schemata framework is that it is helpful in establishing
the correctness of a parser. Furthermore, relations between schemata can be used to
establish the correctness of one schema from that of related ones. In this section, we
show that the schemata for Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and Eisner and Satta (1999)
are correct, and use this to prove the correctness of the schema for Eisner (1996).
Theorem 3
The Eisner and Satta (1999) parsing schema is correct.
Proof 3
To prove correctness, we must show both soundness and completeness. To verify
soundness we need to check that every individual deduction step in the parser infers a
coherent consequent item when applied to coherent antecedents (i.e., in this case, that
steps always generate non-empty items that conform to the definition in Section 3.3).
This is shown by checking that, given two antecedents of a deduction step that contain
a tree licensed by a set of D-rules G, the consequent of the step also contains such a tree.
The tree for the consequent is built from the trees corresponding to the antecedents: by
a graph union operation, in the case of COMBINER steps; or by linking the heads of both
trees with a dependency relation licensed by G, in the case of LINK steps.
To prove completeness we prove that all coherent final items are derivable by
proving the stronger result that all coherent items are derivable. We show this by strong
induction on the length of items, where the length of an item ι = [i, k, h] is defined as
length(ι) = k − i + 1. Coherent items of length 1 are the hypotheses of the schema (of the
form [i, i, i]) which are trivially derivable. We show that, if all coherent items of length m
are derivable for all 1 &lt; m &lt; l, then items of length l are also derivable.
Let [i, k, i] be an item of length l in ZES99 (thus, l = k − i + 1). If this item is coher-
ent, it contains a dependency tree T such that yield(T) = i..k and head(t) = i. By con-
struction, the root of T is labelled i. Let j be the rightmost daughter of i in T. Because T
is projective, we know that the yield of j must be of the form l..k, where i &lt; l &lt; j &lt; k. If
l &lt; j, then l is the leftmost transitive dependent of j in T, and if k &gt; j, then we know that
k is the rightmost transitive dependent of j in T.
Let Tj be the subtree of T rooted at j, T1 be the tree obtained from removing Tj by
T,8 T2 be the tree obtained by removing all the nodes to the right of j from Tj, and T3
be the tree obtained by removing all the nodes to the left of j from Tj. By construction,

T1 belongs to a coherent item [i, l − 1, i], T2 belongs to a coherent item [l, j, j], and T3
belongs to a coherent item [j, k, j]. Because these three items have a length strictly less
than l, by the inductive hypothesis, they are derivable. Thus the item [i, k, i] is also
derivable, as it can be obtained from these derivable items by the following inferences:
[i,l − 1, i], [l, j, j] �- [i, j, i] (by the L-LINK step)
[i, j, i], [j, k, j] �- [i, k, i] (by the L-COMBINER step)
This proves that all coherent items of length l which are of the form [i, k, i] are derivable
under the induction hypothesis. The same can be shown for items of the form [i, k, k] by
symmetric reasoning. ■
Theorem 4
The Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) parsing schema is correct.
Proof 4
Soundness is verified by building forests for the consequents of steps from those cor-
responding to the antecedents. To prove completeness we use strong induction on the
length of items, where the length of an item [i, j] is defined as j − i + 1. The induction
step involves considering any coherent item [i, k] of length l &gt; 2 (l = 2 is the base case
here because items of length 2 are generated by the Initter step) and showing that it
can be inferred from derivable antecedents of length less than l, so it is derivable. If
l &gt; 2, either i has at least one right dependent or k has at least one left dependent in
the item. Suppose i has a right dependent; if T1 and T2 are the trees rooted at i and
k in a forest in [i, k], we call j the rightmost daughter of i and consider the following
trees:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9997835">
• V = the subtree of T1 rooted at j,
• U1 = the tree obtained by removing V from T1,
• U2 = the tree obtained by removing all nodes to the right of j from V,
• U3 = the tree obtained by removing all nodes to the left of j from V.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9774445">
The forest {U1, U2} belongs to the coherent item [i,j], and {U3, T2} belongs to the co-
herent item [j, k]. From these two items, we can obtain [i, k] by using the L-LINK step.
Symmetric reasoning can be applied if i has no right dependents but k has at least one
left dependent, analogously to the case of the previous parser. ■
Theorem 5
The Eisner (1996) parsing schema is correct.
Proof 5
By using the previous proofs and the relationships between schemata established ear-
lier, we show that the parser of Eisner (1996) is correct: Soundness is straightforward,
and completeness can be shown by using the properties of other algorithms. Because
the set of final items in the Eisner (1996) and Eisner and Satta (1999) schemata are the
same, and the former is a step refinement of the latter, the completeness of Eisner and
Satta’s parser directly implies the completeness of Eisner’s parser. Alternatively, we can
use Yamada and Matsumoto’s parser to prove the correctness of Eisner’s parser if we

6.1 Pseudo-Projectivity

<bodyText confidence="0.99492525">
Pseudo-projective parsers generate non-projective analyses in polynomial time by using
a projective parsing strategy and postprocessing the results to establish non-projective
links. This projective parsing strategy can be represented by dependency parsing
schemata such as those seen in Section 3. For example, the algorithm of Kahane, Nasr,
and Rambow (1998) uses a strategy similar to Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), but with the
following initializer step instead of the INITTER and PREDICTOR:
INITTER: [A(�α), i, i � 1]A(α) E P n 1 &lt; i &lt; n
The initialization step specified by Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) differs from this
(directly consuming a nonterminal from the input) but this gives an incomplete algo-
rithm. The problem can be fixed either by using the step shown here instead (bottom–up
Earley strategy) or by adding an additional step turning it into a bottom–up left-corner
parser.

6.2 Attardi (2006)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999379375">
The non-projective parser of Attardi (2006) extends the algorithm of Yamada and
Matsumoto (2003), adding additional shift and reduce actions to handle non-projective
dependency structures. These extra actions allow the parser to link to nodes that are
several positions deep in the stack, creating non-projective links. In particular, Attardi
uses six non-projective actions: two actions to link to nodes that are two positions
deep, another two actions for nodes that are three positions deep, and a third pair
of actions that generalizes the previous ones to n positions deep for any n. Thus, the
maximum depth in the stack to which links can be created can be configured according
to the actions allowed. We use Attd for the variant of the algorithm that allows links
only up to depth d, and Att∞ for the original, unrestricted algorithm with unlimited
depth actions. A nondeterministic version of the algorithm Attd can be described as
follows.
Item set: The item set is ZAtt = I[h1, h2, ... , hm]  |0 &lt; h1 &lt; ... &lt; hm &lt; n + 1} where [h1,
h2,..., hm] is the set of dependency forests of the form IT1, T2, ... , Tm} such that:
head(Ti) = hi for each i E [1..m]; and the projections of the nodes h1,h2,...,hm are pair-
wise disjoint, and their union is [h1..hm].

Deduction steps: The set of deduction steps for Attd is the following:
INITTER: [i,i,i] [h1, h2, ... , hm]
[i + 1,i + 1,i + 1] [hm, hm+1, ... , hp]

<bodyText confidence="0.998521">
Deduction steps for Att∞ are obtained by removing the constraint  |j − i |&lt; d from this
set (this restriction corresponds to the maximum stack depth to which dependency links
can be created).
Final items: The set of final items is {[0, n + 1]}. Although similar to the final item set for
Yamada and Matsumoto’s parser, they differ in that an Attardi item of the form [0, n + 1]
may contain forests with non-projective dependency trees.
Given the number of indices manipulated in the schema, a nondeterministic im-
plementation of Attd has exponential complexity with respect to input length (though
in the implementation of Attardi [2006], control structures determinize the algorithm).
Soundness of the algorithm Att∞ is shown as in the previous algorithms, and complete-
ness can be shown by reasoning that every coherent final item [0, n + 1] can be obtained
by first performing n + 1 INITTER steps to obtain items [i, i + 1] for each 0 &lt; i &lt; n,
then using n COMBINERs to join all of these items into [0, 1, ... , n, n + 1], and then
performing the LINK steps corresponding to the links in a tree contained in [0, n + 1]
to obtain this final item. The algorithm Attd where d is finite is not correct with respect
to the set of non-projective dependency structures, because it only parses a restricted
subset of them (Attardi 2006). Note that the algorithm Attd is a static filter of Attd+1
for every natural number d, since the set of deduction steps of Attd is a subset of that
of Attd+1.

static filter of Attd, because its sets of items and deduction steps are subsets of those
of Attd. Therefore, the set of structures parsed by MHd+2 is also a subset of those parsed
by Attd.
The complexity of the MHk parser is O(nk). For k = 3, MH3 is a step refinement
of the parser by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) that parses projective structures only,
but by modifying the bound k we can define polynomial-time algorithms that parse
larger sets of non-projective dependency structures. The MHk parser has the property
of being able to parse any possible dependency structure as long as we make k large

6.4 MST Parser (McDonald et al. 2005)

McDonald et al. (2005) describe a parser which finds a nonprojective analysis for
a sentence in O(n2) time under a strong independence assumption called an edge-
factored model: Each dependency decision is assumed to be independent of all the
others (McDonald and Satta 2007). Despite the restrictiveness of this model, this max-
imum spanning tree (MST) parser achieves state-of-the-art performance for projective
and non-projective structures (Che et al. 2008; Nivre and McDonald 2008; Surdeanu
et al. 2008). The parser considers the weighted graph formed by all the possible de-
pendencies between pairs of input words, and applies an MST algorithm to find a
dependency tree covering all the words in the sentence and maximizing the sum of
weights.
The MST algorithm for directed graphs suggested by McDonald et al. (2005) is
not fully constructive: It does not work by building structures and combining them
into large structures until it finds the solution. Instead, the algorithm works by using
a greedy strategy to select a candidate set of edges for the spanning tree, potentially
creating cycles and forming an illegal dependency tree. A cycle elimination procedure
is iteratively applied to this graph until a legal dependency tree is obtained. It is still
possible to express declarative aspects of the parser with a parsing schema, although
the importance of the control mechanism in eliminating cycles makes this schema
less informative than other cases we have considered, and we will not discuss it in
detail here. G´omez-Rodr´ıguez (2009) gives a complete description and discussion of the
schema for the MST parser.

Covington’s non-projective parsing algorithm (Covington 1990, 2001) reads the input
from left to right, establishing dependency links between the current word and previous
words in the input. The parser maintains two lists: one with all the words encountered
so far, and one with those that do not yet have a head assigned. A new word can be
linked as a dependent of any of the words in the first list, and as a head of any of the
words in the second list. The following parsing schema expresses this algorithm.
Item set: The item set is ZCovNr = {[i, (h1, h2, ... , hk)]  |1 &lt; h1 &lt; ... &lt; hk &lt; i &lt; n} where
an item [i, (h1, h2, ... , hk)] represents the set of forests of the form F = {T1, T2, ... , Tk}

Final items: The set of final items is {[n, (h)]  |1 &lt; h &lt; n}, the set of items containing a
forest with a single dependency tree T headed at an arbitrary position h of the string,
and whose yield spans the whole input string. The time complexity of the algorithm is
exponential in the input length n.
Note that this parsing schema is not correct, because Covington’s algorithm does
not prevent the generation of cycles in the dependency graphs it produces. Quoting
Covington (2001, page 99),
Because the parser operates one word at a time, unity can only be checked at the end
of the whole process: did it produce a tree with a single root that comprises all of the
words?
Therefore, a postprocessing mechanism is needed to determine which of the gener-
ated structures are, in fact, valid trees. In the parsing schema, this is reflected by the fact
that the schema is complete but not sound. Nivre (2007) uses a variant of this algorithm
in which cycle detection is used to avoid generating incorrect structures.
Other non-projective parsers not covered here can also be represented under the
parsing schema framework. For example, Kuhlmann (2010) presents a deduction sys-
tem for a non-projective parser which uses a grammar formalism called regular de-
pendency grammars. This deduction system can easily be converted into a parsing
schema by associating adequate semantics with items. However, we do not show this
here for space reasons, because we would first have to explain the formalism of regular
dependency grammars.

7. Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Parsing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999773625">
For reasons of computational efficiency, many practical implementations of dependency
parsing are restricted to projective structures. However, some natural language sen-
tences appear to have non-projective syntactic structure, something that arises in many
languages (Havelka 2007), and is particularly common in free word order languages
such as Czech. Parsing without the projectivity constraint is computationally complex:
Although it is possible to parse non-projective structures in quadratic time with respect
to input length under a model in which each dependency decision is independent of
all the others (as in the parser of McDonald et al. [2005], discussed in Section 6.4), the
problem is intractable in the absence of this assumption (McDonald and Satta 2007).
Nivre and Nilsson (2005) observe that most non-projective dependency structures
appearing in practice contain only small proportions of non-projective arcs. This has
led to the study of sub-classes of the class of all non-projective dependency struc-
tures (Kuhlmann and Nivre 2006; Havelka 2007). Kuhlmann (2010) investigates sev-
eral such classes, based on well-nestedness and gap degree constraints (Bodirsky,

(LCFRS) with fan-out k (Vijay-Shanker, Weir, and Joshi 1987; Satta 1992) induce the
set of dependency structures with gap degree at most k − 1; coupled CFG in which
the maximal rank of a nonterminal is k (Hotz and Pitsch 1996) induces the set of well-
nested dependency structures with gap degree at most k − 1; and finally, LTAG (Joshi
and Schabes 1997) induces the set of well-nested dependency structures with gap degree
at most 1.
These results establish that there are polynomial-time dependency parsing algo-
rithms for well-nested structures with bounded gap degree, because such parsers exist
for their corresponding lexicalized constituency-based formalisms. Developing efficient
dependency parsing strategies for these sets of structures has considerable practical
interest, in particular, making it possible to parse directly with dependencies in a
data-driven manner rather than indirectly by constructing intermediate constituency
grammars and extracting dependencies from constituency parses. In this section, we
make four contributions to this enterprise.
Firstly, we define a parser for well-nested structures of gap degree 1, and prove
its correctness. The parser runs in time O(n7), the same complexity as the best existing
algorithms for LTAG (Eisner and Satta 2000), and can be optimized to O(n6) in the non-
lexicalized case. Secondly, we generalize our algorithm to any well-nested dependency
structure with gap degree at most k, resulting in an algorithm with time complexity
O(n5+2k). Thirdly, we generalize the previous parsers in order to include ill-nested
structures with gap degree at most k satisfying certain constraints, giving a parser that
runs in time O(n4+3k). Note that parsing unrestricted ill-nested structures, even when
the gap degree is bounded, is NP-complete: These structures are equivalent to LCFRS
for which the recognition problem is NP-complete (Satta 1992). Finally, we characterize
the set of structures covered by this parser, which we call mildly ill-nested structures,
and show that it includes all the trees present in a number of dependency treebanks.
We now define the concepts of gap degree and well-nestedness (Kuhlmann and
Nivre 2006). Let T be a dependency tree for the string w1 ... wn:
Definition 5
The gap degree of a node k in T is the minimum g E (IN U {0}) such that Lk] (the projec-
tion of the node k) can be written as the union of g + 1 intervals, that is, the number of
discontinuities in Lk]. The gap degree of the dependency tree T is the maximum of the
gap degrees of its nodes.
Note that T has gap degree 0 if and only if T is projective.

where each item of the form [i, j, h,l, r] represents the set of all well-nested dependency
trees rooted at h such that Lh] = {h} ∪ ([i..j] \ [l..r]), and all the nodes (except possibly
h) have gap degree at most 1. We call items of this form gapped items, and the interval
[l..r] the gap of the item. Figure 7 shows two WG1 items, one from I1 and the other from
I2, together with one of the trees contained in each of them. Note that the constraints
h =~ j, h =~ i + 1, h =~ l − 1, h =~ r are added to items to avoid redundancy in the item set.
Because the result of the expression {h} ∪ ([i..j] \ [l..r]) for a given head can be the same
for different sets of values of i, j,l, r, we restrict these values so that we cannot get two
different items representing the same dependency structures. Items ι violating these
constraints always have an alternative representation that does not violate them, which
we can express with a normalizing function nm(ι) as follows:
nm([i,j,j,l,r]) = [i,j − 1,j,l,r] (if r ≤ j − 1 or r = 0), or [i,l − 1,j,0,0] (if r = j − 1).
nm([i,j,l − 1, l,r]) = [i,j,l − 1,l − 1,r](if l &gt; i + 1), or [r + 1,j,l − 1,0,0] (if l = i + 1).
nm([i,j,i − 1, l, r]) = [i − 1, j,i − 1, l, r].
nm([i, j, r,l, r]) = [i, j, r,l, r − 1] (if l &lt; r), or [i, j, r, O, O] (if l = r).
nm([i, j, h,l, r]) = [i, j, h,l, r] for all other items.
When defining the deduction steps for this and other parsers, we assume that they
always produce normalized items. For clarity, we do not explicitly write this in the
deduction steps, writing ι instead of nm(ι) as antecedents and consequents of steps.

particular node are inferred, given the items for the subtrees induced by the direct de-
pendents of that node. Suppose that, in a complete dependency analysis for a sentence
w1 ... wn, the node h has d1 ... dp as direct dependents (i.e., we have dependency links
d1 → h, ... , dp → h). The item corresponding to the subtree induced by h is obtained
from the ones corresponding to the subtrees induced by d1 ... dp as follows.
First, apply the LINK UNGAPPED or LINK GAPPED step to each of the items cor-
responding to the subtrees induced by the direct dependents, and to the hypothesis
[h, h, h, o, o]. We infer p items representing the result of linking each of the dependent
subtrees to the new head h. Second, apply the various COMBINE steps to join all items
obtained in the previous step into a single item. The COMBINE steps perform a union
operation between subtrees. Therefore, the result is a dependency tree containing all the
dependent subtrees, and with all of them linked to h—this is the subtree induced by h.
This process is applied repeatedly to build larger subtrees, until, if the parsing process is
successful, a final item is found containing a dependency tree for the complete sentence.
A graphical representation of this process is shown in Figure 8.

7.2 Proof of Correctness for WG1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999601222222222">
We define a set of coherent items for the schema, in such a way that final items in
this set satisfy the general definition of coherent final items; and then prove the stronger
claims that all derivable items are coherent and all coherent items are derivable. The full
correctness proof has previously been published (G´omez-Rodriguez, Weir, and Carroll
2008; G´omez-Rodriguez 2009), so for reasons of space we only sketch the proof here.
To define the set of coherent items for WG1, we provide a definition of the trees that
these items must contain. Let T be a well-nested dependency tree headed at a node h,
with all its edges licensed by our set of D-rules. We call such a tree a properly formed
tree for the algorithm WG1 if it satisfies the following conditions.

An item [i, j, h,l, r] E IWG1 is coherent if it contains a properly formed tree headed at
h, such that Lh] = {h} U ([i..j] \ [l..r]). Similarily for items of the form [i,j,h,o,o], where
Lh] = {h} U [i..j]. A coherent final item [1, n, h, o, o] for an input string contains at least
one well-nested parse of gap degree ≤ 1 for that string. With these sets of coherent and
coherent final items, we prove the soundness and completeness of WG1.
Theorem 6
WG1 is sound.
Proof 6
Proving the soundness of the WG1 parser involves showing that all derivable final items
are coherent. We do this by proving the stronger claim that all derivable items are
coherent. As in previous proofs, this is done by showing that each deduction step in
the parser infers a coherent consequent item when applied to coherent antecedents. We
proceed step by step, showing that if each of the antecedents of a given step contains at
least one properly formed tree, we obtain a properly formed tree that is an element of the
corresponding consequent. In the case of LINK steps, this properly formed consequent
tree is obtained by creating a dependency link between the heads of the properly formed
antecedent trees; for COMBINE steps, it is obtained from the union of the antecedent
trees. To prove that these consequent trees are properly formed, we show that they are
well-nested, have a projection corresponding to the indices in the consequent item, and
satisfy the gap degree constraint 2 required for the trees to be properly formed. Each
of these properties is proven individually, based on the properties of the antecedent
trees. ■

1. If Lh] = {h} U [i..j], then the item [i, j, h, o, o] containing T is a derivable

This implies that all coherent final items are derivable, and therefore that WG1 is
complete. The lemma is proven by strong induction on the number of elements in Lh],
which we denote #(Lh]).
The base case of the induction is trivial, because the case #(Lh]) = 1 corresponds to
a tree contained in an initial item, which is derivable by definition. For the induction
step, we take T to be a properly formed dependency tree rooted at a node h, such that
#(Lh]) = N for some N &gt; 1. Lemma 1 holds for T if it holds for every properly formed
dependency tree T&apos; rooted at h&apos; such that #(Lh&apos;]) &lt; N. Let p be the number of direct
children of h in the tree T. We have p &gt; 1, because by hypothesis #(Lh]) &gt; 1. With this,
the induction step proof is divided into two cases, according to whether p = 1 or p &gt; 1.
When p = 1, the item that Lemma 1 associates with the subtree of T induced by the
single direct dependent of h is known to be derivable by the induction hypothesis. It
can be shown case by case that the item corresponding to h by Lemma 1 can be inferred
using LINK steps, thus completing the case for p = 1. For p &gt; 1, we use the concept of
order annotations (Kuhlmann and M¨ohl 2007; Kuhlmann 2010). Order annotations are
strings that encode the precedence relation between the nodes of a dependency tree. The
order annotation for a given node encodes the shape (with respect to this precedence
relation) of the projection of each of the children of that node, that is, the number of
intervals in each projection, the number of gaps, and the way in which intervals and
gaps are interleaved. The concepts of projectivity, gap degree, and well-nestedness are
associated with particular constraints on order annotations.
The completeness proof for p &gt; 1 is divided into cases according to the order
annotation of the head h. The fact that the tree T is properly formed imposes constraints
on the form of this order annotation. With this information, we divide the possible
order annotations into a number of cases. Using the induction hypotheses and some
relevant properties of order annotations we find that, for each of this cases, we can find
a sequence of COMBINE steps to infer the item corresponding to T from smaller coherent
items. ■

input is as expected for this set of structures, because Kuhlmann (2010) shows that they
are equivalent to LTAG, and the best existing parsers for this formalism also perform
in O(n7) (Eisner and Satta 2000).9 Note that the COMBINE step that is the bottleneck
only uses seven indices, not any additional entities such as D-rules. Hence, the O(n7)
complexity does not involve additional factors relating to grammar size.
Given unlexicalized D-rules specifying the possibility of dependencies between
pairs of categories rather than pairs of words, a variant of this parser can be constructed
with time complexity O(n6), as with parsers for unlexicalized TAG. We expand the
item set with unlexicalized items of the form [i, j, C,l, r], where C is a category, distinct
from the existing items [i, j, h,l, r]. Steps in the parser are duplicated, to work both with
lexicalized and unlexicalized items, except for the LINK steps, which always work with
a lexicalized item and an unlexicalized hypothesis to produce an unlexicalized item,
and the COMBINE SHRINKING GAP steps, which work only with unlexicalized items.
Steps are added to obtain lexicalized items from their unlexicalized equivalents by
binding the head to particular string positions. Finally, we need certain variants of the
COMBINE SHRINKING GAP steps that take two unlexicalized antecedents and produce
a lexicalized consequent; an example is the following:

complexity result is in line with what could be expected from previous research in
constituency parsing: Kuhlmann (2010) shows that the set of well-nested dependency
structures with gap degree at most k is closely related to coupled CFG in which the
maximal rank of a nonterminal is k + 1. The constituency parser defined by Hotz and
Pitsch (1996) for these grammars also adds an n2 factor for each unit increment of k. Note
that a small value of k appears to be sufficient to account for the vast majority of the
non-projective sentences found in natural language treebanks. For instance, the Prague
Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc et al. 2006) contains no structures with gap degree greater
than 4. Thus, a WG4 parser would be able to analyze all the well-nested structures in
this treebank, which represent 99.89% of the total (WG1 would be able to parse 99.49%).
Increasing k beyond 4 would not produce further improvements in coverage.

7.7 Parsing Ill-Nested Structures: MG1 and MGk
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962875">
The WGk parser analyzes dependency structures with bounded gap degree as long as
they are well-nested. Although this covers the vast majority of the structures that occur
in natural language treebanks (Kuhlmann and Nivre 2006), a significant number of sen-
tences contain ill-nested structures. Maier and Lichte (2011) provide examples of some
linguistic phenomena that cause ill-nestedness. Unfortunately, the general problem of
parsing ill-nested structures is NP-complete, even when the gap degree is bounded.
This set of structures is closely related to LCFRS with bounded fan-out and unbounded
production length, and parsing in this formalism is known to be NP-complete (Satta
1992). The reason for this complexity is the problem of unrestricted crossing configura-
tions, appearing when dependency subtrees are allowed to interleave in every possi-
ble way.
Ill-nested structures can be parsed in polynomial time with bounds on the gap
degree and the number of dependents allowed per node: Kuhlmann (2010) presents
a parser based on this idea, using a kind of grammar that resembles LCFRS, called
regular dependency grammar. This parser is exponential in the gap degree, as well as in
the maximum number of dependents allowed per node: Its complexity is O(nk(m+1)),
where k is the maximum gap degree and m is the maximum number of dependents per
node. In contrast, the parsers presented here are data-driven and thus do not need an
explicit grammar. Furthermore, they are able to parse dependency structures with any
number of dependents per node, and their computational complexity is independent of
this parameter m.
In line with the observation that most non-projective structures appearing in prac-
tice are only “slightly” non-projective (Nivre and Nilsson 2005), we characterize a
sense in which the structures appearing in treebanks are only “slightly” ill-nested. We

generalize the algorithms WG1 and WGk to parse a proper superset of the set of well-
nested structures in polynomial time, and give a characterization of this new set of
structures, which includes all the structures in several dependency treebanks.
The WGk parser for well-nested structures presented previously is based on a
bottom–up process, where LINK steps are used to link completed subtrees to a head,
and COMBINE steps are used to join subtrees governed by a common head to obtain a
larger structure. As WGk is a parser for well-nested structures of gap degree up to k,
its COMBINER steps correspond to all the ways in which we can join two sets of sibling
subtrees meeting these constraints, and having a common head, into another. Therefore,
this parser does not use COMBINER steps that produce interleaved subtrees, because
these would generate items corresponding to ill-nested structures.
We obtain a polynomial parser for a larger set of structures of gap degree at most
k, including some ill-nested ones, by having COMBINER steps representing all ways in
which two sets of sibling subtrees of gap degree at most k with a common head can be
joined into another, including those producing interleaved subtrees. This does not mean
that we build every possible ill-nested structure. Some structures with complex crossed
configurations have gap degree k, but cannot be built by combining two structures of
that gap degree. More specifically, this algorithm will parse a dependency structure
(well-nested or not) if there exists a binarization of that structure that has gap degree at
most k. The parser works by implicitly finding such a binarization, because COMBINE
steps are always applied to two items and no intermediate item generated by them can
exceed gap degree k (not counting the position of the head in the projection).

These extra COMBINE steps allow the parser to combine interleaved subtrees with
simple crossing configurations. The MG1 parser still runs in O(n7), as these new steps
do not use more than seven string positions. To generalize this algorithm to mildly
ill-nested structures for gap degree k, we add a COMBINE step for every possible
way of joining two structures of gap degree at most k into another. This is done in a
systematic way by considering a set of strings over an alphabet of three symbols: a
and b to represent intervals of words in the projection of each of the structures, and
g to represent intervals that are not in the projection of either of the structures and
will correspond to gaps in the joined structure. The legal combinations of structures
for gap degree k will correspond to strings where symbols a and b each appear at most
k + 1 times, g appears at most k times and is not the first or last symbol, and there is
no more than one consecutive appearance of any symbol. Given a string of this form,
of length n, with a’s located at positions a1 ... ap(1 ≤ a1 &lt; ... &lt; ap ≤ n), b’s at positions

most k except for its root node, which can have gap degree up to k + 1.
The sets of coherent and coherent final items are defined as in previous proofs. Sound-
ness is shown as for previous algorithms, where we show that consequent trees are
properly formed by building a binarization for them from the binarizations obtained
from antecedent items. This part of the proof involves imposing additional constraints
on binarizations, which are useful to provide a suitable way of combining binarizations
obtained from antecedents of steps. Completeness is proven by showing the following,
stronger claim.
Proposition 1
Let T be a dependency tree headed at node h, and properly formed for MGk. Then, if
Lh] = {h} U ([i..j] \ Ugp=1[lp..rp]), for g &lt; k, the item [i,j,h, ((l1, r1),..., (lg,rg))] containing
T is derivable under this parser.
To prove this, we say that a binarization of a properly formed tree is a well-formed
binarization for MGk if each of its nodes has gap degree &lt; k except possibly the head,
which can have gap degree k + 1. We then reduce the proof to establishing the following
lemma.
Lemma 2
Let B be a well-formed binarization of a dependency tree T, headed at a node h and
properly formed for MGk. If the projection of h in T is Lh]T = Lh]B = {h} U ([i..j] \
Ugp=1[lp..rp]), for g &lt; k, the item [i,j,h,((l1,r1),..., (lg,rg))] containing T is derivable
under this parser.
The lemma is shown by strong induction on the number of nodes of B (denoted #B).
The base case where #B = 1 is trivial. For the induction step, we consider different cases
depending on the number and type of children of the head node h of B. When h has a
single child, we obtain the item corresponding to T from a smaller item, shown to be
derivable by the induction hypothesis, by using a LINK step. Where h has two children
in B, the relevant item is obtained by using a COMBINER step. ■

7.10 Mildly Ill-Nested Dependency Structures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.858991277777778">
The MGk algorithm parses mildly ill-nested structures for gap degree k in polynomial
time. The mildly ill-nested structures for gap degree k are those with a binarization of
gap degree &lt; k. Because a binarization of a dependency structure cannot have lower gap
degree than the original structure, the mildly ill-nested structures for gap degree k all
have gap degree &lt; k. Given the relation between MGk and WGk, we know they contain
all well-nested structures with gap degree &lt; k. Figure 9 shows a structure with gap
degree 1, but which is strongly ill-nested for gap degree 1. For all trees up to 10 nodes
(excluding the dummy root node at position 0) all structures of gap degree k with
length smaller than 10 are well-nested or only mildly ill-nested for that gap degree.
Even if T is strongly ill-nested for a gap degree, there is always an m E IN such that
T is mildly ill-nested for m (every structure can be binarized, and binarizations have
finite gap degree). For example, the structure in Figure 9 is mildly ill-nested for gap
degree 2. Therefore, MGk parsers have the property of being able to parse any arbitrary
dependency structure as long as we make k large enough. Structures like the one in
Figure 9 do not arise in dependency treebanks. None of the treebanks for nine different
languages10 contain structures that are strongly ill-nested for their gap degree (Table 1).
Therefore, in any of these treebanks, the MGk parser can parse every sentence with gap
degree at most k in time O(n3k+4).

Cycles: The sets of links representing the structure of sentences in LG may contain cycles,
in contrast to dependency structures.
LG is a grammar-based formalism in which a grammar G consists of a set of words,
each of which is associated with a set of linking requirements. Given a link grammar G,
a set of labelled links between the words of a sentence w1 ... wn is said to be a linkage
for that sentence if it satisfies the following conditions: planarity (the links do not cross
when drawn above the words), connectivity (the undirected graph defined by links is
connected), and satisfaction (the links satisfy the linking requirements of all the words in
the input). An input sentence is considered grammatical with respect to a link grammar
G if it is possible to build a linkage for the sentence with the grammar G.
The linking requirements of a word are expressed as a set of rules specifying the
labels of the links that can be established between that word and other words located
to its left or to its right. Linking requirements can include constraints on the order of
the links, for example, a requirement can specify that a word w can be linked to two
words located to its left in such a way that the link to the farthest (leftmost) word has a
particular label L2 and the link to the closest word has a label L1.
We use the disjunctive form notation (Sleator and Temperley 1991) to denote
linking requirements: The requirements of words are expressed as a set of disjuncts.
Each disjunct corresponds to one way of satisfying the requirements of the word. We
represent a disjunct for a word w as a pair of strings Δ = (R1R2 ... Rq, L1L2 ... Lp) where
L1, L2, ... Lp are the labels of the links that must connect w to words located to the left
of w, which must be monotonically increasing in distance from w (e.g., Lp links to the
leftmost word that is directly linked to w), and R1, R2, ... Rp are the labels of the links
that must connect w to words to its right, also monotonically increasing in distance from
w (e.g., Rq links to the rightmost word that is directly connected to w).

Given a link grammar G and a string w1 ... wn, a partial linkage is any edge-labeled
undirected graph H such that the following conditions hold.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.923276166666667">
• The graph H has n vertices {v1,.. . , vn}, where each vertex vi is a tuple
(wi, i, Di) such that Di is a disjunct for wi in the grammar G.
• The graph H is connected and satisfies the planarity requirement with
respect to the order v1, ... , vn of vertices (i.e., if we draw vertices in that
order, with the given links, the links do not cross).
• Given a vertex vi = (wi, i, Di) such that Di = (R1R2 ... Rq, L1L2 ... Lp), the
following conditions are satisfied:
– Every edge {vi, vj} with j &lt; i must be labelled Ls for some 1 &lt; s &lt; p.
– For every pair of edges {vi, vj}, {vi, vk} such that k &lt; j &lt; i, we have
that {vi,vj} is labelled Ls1, {vi,vk} is labelled Ls2, and s1 &lt; s2.
– Every edge {vi, vj} with j &gt; i must be labelled Rt for some 1 &lt; t &lt; q.
– For every pair of edges {vi, vj}, {vi, vk} such that k &gt; j &gt; i, we have
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981331842105263">
that {vi,vj} is labelled Rt1, {vi,vk} is labelled Rt2, and t1 &lt; t2.
Informally, a partial linkage is the result of choosing a particular disjunct from those
available for each word in the input string, and then adding labelled links between
words that are compatible with the requirements of the disjunct. Compatibility means
that, for each word wi associated with a disjunct Di = (R1R2 ... Rq, L1L2 ... Lp), the list
of labels of links connecting vi to words to its right, ordered from the leftmost to the
rightmost such word, is of the form Ri1, Ri2, ... Rir, with 0 &lt; i1 &lt; i2 &lt; ... &lt; ir &lt; q and,
symmetrically, the list of labels of links connecting vi to words to its left, ordered from
the rightmost to the leftmost, is of the form Lj1, Lj2, ... Ljl, with 0 &lt; j1 &lt; j2 &lt; ... &lt; jl &lt; p.
Given such a linkage, the right linking requirements Ri1, Ri2, ... Rir of the word wi are
satisfied, and the same for the left linking requirements Lj1, Lj2, ... Ljl of wi. Linking
requirements that are not satisfied (e.g., the requirement of a link Rk in the disjunct asso-
ciated with word wi, with 0 &lt; k &lt; q, such that k ∈/ {i1, ..., ir}) are said to be unsatisfied.
The definition of item sets for LG resembles those for dependency parsers (Defini-
tion 4), where items come from a partition of the set of partial linkages for a given link
grammar G. With these item sets, LG parsing schemata are analogous to the depen-
dency and constituency cases. As an example of an LG parsing schema, we describe the
original LG parser by Sleator and Temperley (1991), and show how projective parsing
schemata, such as those seen in Section 3, can be adapted to obtain new LG parsers.

if there is a direct link between wi and wj, and C is True if and only if all the inner words
in the span are transitively reflexively linked to one of the end words wi or wj, and have
all of their linking requirements satisfied.
String positions referenced by the items in ISlT range from 0 to n + 1. Position 0
corresponds to an artificial word w0 (the wall) that the LG formalism inserts at the
beginning of every input sentence (Sleator and Temperley 1991). Therefore, we assume
that strings are extended with this symbol. On the other hand, position n + 1 corre-
sponds to a dummy word wn+1 that must not be linkable to any other, and is used by
the parser for convenience, as in the schema for Yamada and Matsumoto’s dependency
parser (Section 3.4).
We use the notation [i, α, β] as shorthand for the item [i, i, •α, •β, False, True], which
is an item used to select a particular disjunct for a word wi.

item from each sequence of deduction steps that generates it. The SELECTDISJUNCT
step chooses one of the available disjuncts for a given word wi. The INITTER step starts
the top–down process by constructing a linkage that spans the whole string w1 ... wn,
but where no links have been constructed yet. Then, the PREDICT and LINKPREDICT
steps repeatedly divide the problem of finding a linkage for a substring wi ... wj into
the smaller subproblems of finding linkages for wi ... wz and wz ... wj, with i &lt; z &lt; j. In
particular, the LEFTPREDICT step poses the subproblem of finding a linkage for wi ... wz
in which wi is not directly linked to wz, and LEFTLINKPREDICT poses the same problem
while building a direct link from wi to wz. RIGHTPREDICT and RIGHTLINKPREDICT
proceed analogously for the substring wz ... wj. After these two smaller linkages have
been found, they are combined by a COMPLETER step into a larger linkage; the flags
b and c in items are used by the COMPLETER step to ensure that its resulting item
will contain a valid linkage satisfying the connectivity constraint. An example of this
process, where a particular substring is parsed by using the LEFTLINKPREDICT and
RIGHTPREDICT steps to divide it into smaller substrings, is shown in Figure 10. The
algorithm runs in time O(n3) with respect to the length of the input, because none of its
deduction steps uses more than three independent string position indices.
Final items: The set of final items is {[0, n + 1, α•, P•, B, True]}. Items of this form contain
full valid linkages for the string w0 ... wn, because having the second boolean flag set to
True implies that their linkages for w0 ... wn+1 have at most two connected components,
and we have assumed that the word wn+1 cannot be linked to any other, so one of the
components must link w0 ... wn.

headed at the words wi and wj, the analogous item in the corresponding LG parsing
schema will contain linkages with two connected components, one containing the word
wi and the other containing wj. The notion of a head is lost in the conversion because
the undirected LG linkages do not make distinctions between heads and dependents.
This simplifies the notation used to denote items in some cases: For instance, we do not
need to make a distinction between Eisner items of the form [i, j, True, False] and those
of the form [i, j, False, True], because their structure is the same other than the direction
of the links. Therefore, items in the LG version of Eisner’s parser will use a single flag,
indicating whether linkages contained in them have one or two connected components.
The combining and linking steps of the dependency parsers are directly translated
to LG. If the original dependency steps always produce items containing projective
dependency forests, the resulting LG steps produce items with planar linkages. When
the original dependency steps have constraints related to the position of the head in
items (like combiner steps in Eisner’s parser, where we can combine [i, j, True, False] with
[j, k, True, False] but not with [j, k, False, True]), we ignore these constraints, allowing any
word in a linkage to be its “head” for the purpose of linking it to other linkages.
Because projective dependency parsers do not allow cyclic structures, we add steps
or remove constraints to allow cycles, so that the parsers are able to link two words that
are already in the same connected component of a linkage. In the schema obtained from
Eisner’s parser, this is done by allowing LINK steps to be applied to items representing
fully connected linkages; in the schema corresponding to Eisner and Satta’s parser we
allow COMBINER steps to create a link in addition to joining two linkages; and in the
schema for Yamada and Matsumoto’s parser we add a step that creates two links at the
same time, combining the functionality of the L-LINK and R-LINK steps.
Finally, because LG is a grammar-based formalism where the set of valid linkages
is constrained by disjuncts associated with words, we include disjunct information in
items in order to ensure that only grammatical linkages are constructed. This is similar
to the schema for Sleator and Temperley’s parser, but in this case items need to specify
both left and right linking requirements for each of their end words: These bottom–
up parsers establish links from end words of an item to words outside the item’s span
(which can be to the left or to the right of the span) rather than to words inside the span
(which are always to the right of the left end word, and to the left of the right end word).
Based on this, the following is an LG variant of the projective dependency parser of
Eisner (1996).
Item set: The item set is

<equation confidence="0.9962235">
ZEisLG = {[i,j,α1 • β1,α2 • β2,α3,α4,B]  |0 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; n

satisfied. Requirements appear in α3 and α1β1 in increasing order of link
distance.

These steps resemble those in the schema for Eisner’s dependency parser, with the
exception that the LINK step is able to build links on items that contain fully connected
linkages (equivalent to the [i, j, True, False] and [i, j, False, True] items of the dependency
parser). A version of the parser restricted to acyclic linkages can be obtained by adding
the constraint that B must equal False in the LINK step.
Final items: The set of final items is {[0, n, α•, β•, c, c, True]}, corresponding to the set of
items containing fully connected linkages for the whole input string.
LG parsing schemata based on the parsers of Eisner and Satta (1999) and Yamada
and Matsumoto (2003) are not shown here for space reasons, but are presented by
G´omez-Rodr´ıguez (2009). The relationships between these three LG parsing schemata
are the same as the corresponding dependency parsing schemata, that is, the LG vari-
ants of Eisner and Satta’s and Yamada and Matsumoto’s dependency parsers are step
contractions of the LG variant of Eisner’s parser. As with the algorithm of Sleator and
Temperley, these bottom–up LG parsers run in cubic time with respect to input length.

<bodyText confidence="0.993485857142857">
The parsing schemata formalism of Sikkel (1997) has previously been used to define,
analyze, and compare algorithms for constituency-based parsing. We have shown how
to extend the formalism to dependency parsers, as well as the related Link Grammar
formalism.
Deductive approaches have been used in the past to describe individual depen-
dency parsers: In Kuhlmann (2007, 2010) a grammatical deduction system was used to
define a parser for regular dependency grammars.

McDonald and Nivre (2007) give an alternative framework for dependency parsers,
viewing them as transition systems. That model is based on parser configurations and
transitions, and has no clear relationship to the approach described here.
To demonstrate the theoretical uses of dependency parsing schemata, we have used
them to describe a wide range of existing projective and non-projective dependency
parsers. We have also clarified various relations between parsers which were origi-
nally formulated very differently—for example, establishing the relation between the
dynamic programming algorithm of Eisner (1996) and the transition-based parser of
Yamada and Matsumoto (2003). We have also used the parsing schemata framework as
a formal tool to verify the correctness of parsing algorithms.
Not only are dependency parsing schemata useful when describing and extending
existing parsing algorithms, they can be used to define new parsers. We have presented
an algorithm that can parse any well-nested dependency structure with gap degree
bounded by a constant k with time complexity O(n2k+5), and additionally, have defined
a wider set of structures that we call mildly ill-nested for a given gap degree k, and
presented an algorithm that can parse these in time O(n3k+4). The practical relevance
of this set of structures can be seen in the data obtained from several dependency
treebanks, showing that all the sentences contained in them are mildly ill-nested for
their gap degree, and thus they are parsable with this algorithm. The strategy used
by this algorithm for parsing mildly ill-nested structures has been adapted to solve
the problem of finding minimal fan-out binarizations of LCFRS to improve parsing
efficiency (see G´omez-Rodriguez et al. 2009).
An interesting line of future work would be to provide implementations of the
mildly non-projective dependency parsers presented here, using probabilistic models to
guide their linking decisions, and compare their practical performance and accuracy to
those of other non-projective dependency parsers. Additionally, our definition of mildly
ill-nested structures is closely related to the way the corresponding parser works. It
would be interesting to find a more grammar-oriented definition that would provide
linguistic insight into this set of structures.
An alternative generalization of the concept of well-nestedness has recently been
introduced by Maier and Lichte (2011). The definition of this property of structures,
called k-ill-nestedness, is more declarative than that of mildly ill-nestedness. However,
it is based on properties that are not local to projections or subtrees, and there is no
evidence that k-ill-nested structures are parsable in polynomial time.
Finally, we observe that that some well-known parsing algorithms discussed here
(Nivre 2003; McDonald et al. 2005) rely on statistically-driven control mechanisms that
fall below the abstraction level of parsing schemata. Therefore, it would be useful to
have an extension of parsing schemata allowing the description and comparison of
these control structures in a general way.

<abstract confidence="0.9900117">We introduce dependency parsing schemata, a formal framework based on Sikkel’s parsing schemata for constituency parsers, which can be used to describe, analyze, and compare dependency parsing algorithms. We use this framework to describe several well-known projective and non-projective dependency parsers, build correctness proofs, and establish formal relationships between them. We then use the framework to define new polynomial-time parsing algorithms for various mildly non-projective dependency formalisms, including well-nested structures with gap degree bounded by a constant time and a new class that includes all degree present in several natural language treebanks (which we call mildly structures for gap degree in time Finally, we illustrate how the parsing schema framework can be applied to Link Grammar, a dependency-related formalism.</abstract>

The problem can be fixed either by using the step shown here instead (bottom–up Earley strategy) or by adding an additional step turning it into a bottom–up left-corner parser. 6.2 Attardi (2006) The non-projective parser of Attardi (2006) extends the algorithm of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), adding additional shift and reduce actions to handle non-projective dependency structures. These extra actions allow the parser to link to nodes that are several positions deep in the stack, creating non-projective links. In particular, Attardi uses six non-projective actions: two actions to link to nodes that are two positions deep, another two actions for nodes that are three positions deep, and a third pair of actions that generalizes the previous ones to n positions deep for any n. Thus, the </context>

The algorithm Attd where d is finite is not correct with respect to the set of non-projective dependency structures, because it only parses a restricted subset of them (Attardi 2006). Note that the algorithm Attd is a static filter of Attd+1 for every natural number d, since the set of deduction steps of Attd is a subset of that of Attd+1. 6.3 The MHk Parser We now define a novel variant of Attardi’s parser with polynomial complexity by limiting the number of trees in each forest contained in an item (rather than limiting stack depth), producing a parsing schema MHk (standing for multi-headed with at most k heads per item). Its item set is ZMHk = {[h1, h2, ... , hm] |0 &lt; h1 &lt; ... &lt; hm &lt; n + 1 n 2 &lt; m &lt; k} where [h1, h2, ... , hm] is defined as in ZAtt, and the deduction s</context>

We begin by addressing a number of preliminary issues. Traditional parsing schemata are used to define grammar-driven parsers, in which the parsing process is guided by some set of rules which are used to license deduction steps. For example, an Earley PREDICTOR step is tied to a particular grammar rule, and can only be executed if such a rule exists. Some dependency parsers are also grammardriven. For example, those described by Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), Barbero et al. (1998), and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of dependency grammar CFG-like rules described by Hays (1964) and Gaifman (1965). However, many of the algorithms (Eisner 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003) are not traditionally considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar; decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilistic models (Eisner 1996) or classifiers (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003). These are called data-driven parsers. To express such algorithms as deduction systems, we use the notion of D-rule</context>

The schema for Lombardo and Lesmo’s parser is a variant of the Earley constituency parser (cf. Sikkel 1997), with minor changes to adapt it to dependency grammar (for example, the SCANNER always moves the dot over the head symbol *, rather than over a terminal symbol). Analogously, other dependency parsing schemata based on CFG-like rules can be obtained by modifying CFG parsing schemata of Sikkel (1997): The algorithm of Barbero et al. (1998) can be obtained from the left-corner parser, and the parser described by Courtin and Genthial (1998) is a variant of the head-corner parser. 3.6 Nivre (2003) Nivre (2003) describes a shift-reduce algorithm for projective dependency parsing, later extended by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004). With linear-time performance and competitive parsing accuracy (Nivre et al. 2006; Nivre and McDonald 2008), it is one of the parsers included in the MaltParser system (Nivre et al. 2007), which is currently widely used (e.g., Nivre et al. 2007; Surdeanu et al. 2008). The parser proceeds by reading the sent</context>

Although this parser uses three indices i, j, h, using CFG-like rules to guide linking decisions makes the h indices redundant. This simplification is an item contraction which results in an O(n3) head-corner parser. From here, we can follow the procedure described by Sikkel (1994) to relate this head-corner algorithm to parsers analogous to other algorithms for CFGs. In this way, we can refine the head-corner parser to a variant of the algorithm by de Vreught and Honig (1989) (Sikkel 1997), and by successive filters we reach a left-corner parser which is equivalent to the one described by Barbero et al. (1998), and a step contraction of the Earley-based dependency parser by Lombardo 556 G´omez-Rodriguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata and Lesmo (1996). The proofs for these relations are the same as those given by Sikkel (1994), except that the dependency variants of each algorithm are simpler (due to the absence of epsilon rules and the fact that the rules are lexicalized). The names used for schemata dVH1, dVH2, dVH3, and buLC shown in Figure 6 come from Sikkel (1994, 1997).

Side conditions restrict the inference relation by specifying which combinations of values are permissible for the variables appearing in the antecedents and consequent of deduction steps. This parsing schema specifies a recognizer: Given a set of D-rules and an input string w1 ... wn, the sentence can be parsed (projectively) under those D-rules if and only if the deduction system infers a coherent final item. When executing this schema with a deductive engine, the parse forest can be recovered by following back pointers, as in constituency parsers (Billot and Lang 1989). This schema formalizes a parsing logic which is independent of the order and the way linking decisions are taken. Statistical models can be used to determine whether a step linking words a and b in positions i and j—i.e., having (a, i) -4 (b, j) as a side condition—is executed or not, and probabilities can be attached to items in order to assign different weights to different analyses of the sentence. The side conditions provide an explicit representation of the choice points where probabilistic decisions are made by the control mechanism that is executing the schema.

(2005) describe a parser which finds a nonprojective analysis for a sentence in O(n2) time under a strong independence assumption called an edgefactored model: Each dependency decision is assumed to be independent of all the others (McDonald and Satta 2007). Despite the restrictiveness of this model, this maximum spanning tree (MST) parser achieves state-of-the-art performance for projective and non-projective structures (Che et al. 2008; Nivre and McDonald 2008; Surdeanu et al. 2008). The parser considers the weighted graph formed by all the possible dependencies between pairs of input words, and applies an MST algorithm to find a dependency tree covering all the words in the sentence and maximizing the sum of weights. The MST algorithm for directed graphs suggested by McDonald et al. (2005) is not fully constructive: It does not work by building structures and combining them into large structures until it finds the solution.

White rectangles in an item represent intervals of nodes that have been assigned a head by the parser, and dark squares represent nodes that have no head. 3.1 Collins (1996) One of the most straightforward projective dependency parsing strategies was introduced by Collins (1996), and is based on the CYK bottom–up parsing strategy (Kasami 1965; Younger 1967). Collins’s parser works with dependency trees which are linked to each other by creating links between their heads. The schema for this parser maps every set of D-rules G and input string w1 ... wn to an instantiated dependency parsing system (ZCol96, R, DCol96) such that: Item set: The item set is defined as ZCol96 = {[i, j, h] |1 &lt; i &lt; h &lt; j &lt; n}, where item [i, j, h] is defined as the set of forests contain</context>

COMBINER steps follow the same mechanism as those in the algorithm of Eisner (1996), and LINK steps work analogously to those of Collins (1996), so this schema can be seen as being intermediate between those two algorithms. These relationships will be formally described in Section 4. Final items: The set of final items is {[0,n,0]}. By convention, parse trees have the beginning-of-sentence marker 0 as their head, as in the previous algorithm. When described for head automaton grammars (Eisner and Satta 1999), this algorithm appears to be more complex to understand and implement than the previous one, requiring four different kinds of items to keep track of the state of the automata used by the grammars. However, this abstract represe</context>

The optimization in Yamada and Matsumoto’s parser comes from contracting deductions in Eisner’s parser so that linking operations are immediately followed by combining operations; whereas Eisner and Satta’s parser does the opposite, forcing combining operations to be followed by linking operations. By generalizing the linking steps in Eisner and Satta’s parser so that the head of each item can be in any position, we obtain an O(n5) parser which can be filtered into the parser of Collins (1996) by eliminating the COMBINER steps. From Collins’s parser, we obtain an O(n5) head-corner parser based on CFG-like rules by an item refinement in which each Collins item [i, j, h] is split into a set of items [A(α • R • γ), i, j, h]. The refinement relation between these parsers only holds if for every D-rule B - 4A there is a corresponding CFG-like rule A -4 ... B ... in the grammar used by the head-corner parser. Although this parser uses three indices i, j, h, using CFG-like rules to guide linking decisions makes the h indices redundant. This simplification is an item contraction which resu</context>

Analogously, other dependency parsing schemata based on CFG-like rules can be obtained by modifying CFG parsing schemata of Sikkel (1997): The algorithm of Barbero et al.

However, many of the algorithms (Eisner 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003) are not traditionally considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar; decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilistic models (Eisner 1996) or classifiers (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003). These are called data-driven parsers. To express such algorithms as deduction systems, we use the notion of D-rules (Covington 1990). D-rules have the form (a, i) → (b, j), which specifies that a word b located at position j in the input string can have the word a in position i as a dependent. Deduction steps in data-driven parsers can be associated with the D-rules corresponding to the links they create, so that parsing schemata for such parsers are defined using grammars of D-rules. In this way, we obtain a representation of some of the declarative aspects of these parsing strategies that is independent of the particular model used to make the decisions associated with each D-rule.

It is still possible to express declarative aspects of the parser with a parsing schema, although the importance of the control mechanism in eliminating cycles makes this schema less informative than other cases we have considered, and we will not discuss it in detail here. G´omez-Rodr´ıguez (2009) gives a complete description and discussion of the schema for the MST parser. 6.5 Covington’s (1990, 2001) Non-Projective Parser Covington’s non-projective parsing algorithm (Covington 1990, 2001) reads the input from left to right, establishing dependency links between the current word and previous words in the input. The parser maintains two lists: one with all the words encountered so far, and one with those that do not yet have a head assigned. A new word can be linked as a dependent of any of the words in the first list, and as a head of any of the words in the second list. The following parsing schema expresses this algorithm. Item set: The item set is ZCovNr = {[i, (h1, h2, ... , hk)] |1 &lt; h1 &lt; ... &lt; hk &lt; i &lt; n} where an item [i, (h1, h2, ... , hk)] represents the set of </context>

Unfortunately, the algorithm presented in Covington (2001) is not complete: It does not parse all projective dependency structures, because when creating leftward links it assumes that the head of a node i must be a reflexive-transitive head of the node i − 1, which is not always the case. For instance, the structure shown in Figure 5 cannot be parsed because the constraints imposed by the algorithm prevent it from finding the head of 4. The Malt</context>

The time complexity of the algorithm is exponential in the input length n. Note that this parsing schema is not correct, because Covington’s algorithm does not prevent the generation of cycles in the dependency graphs it produces. Quoting Covington (2001, page 99), Because the parser operates one word at a time, unity can only be checked at the end of the whole process: did it produce a tree with a single root that comprises all of the words? Therefore, a postprocessing mechanism is needed to determine which of the generated structures are, in fact, valid trees. In the parsing schema, this is reflected by the fact that the schema is complete but not sound. Nivre (2007) uses a variant of this algorithm in which cycle detection is used to avoid generating incorrect structures. Other non-projective parsers not covered here can also be represente</context>

For example, a rule of the form N(Det * PP) is used to allow N to have Det as left dependent and PP as right dependent. The algorithm by Lombardo and Lesmo is a version of Earley’s CFG parser (Earley 1970) that uses Gaifman’s dependency grammar (Gaifman 1965). As this algorithm predicts dependency relations before building them, item sets contain extended dependency trees, trees that have two kinds of nodes: preterminal nodes and terminal nodes. Depending on whether all the preterminal nodes have been linked to terminals, extended dependency trees can either be grounded, in which case they are isomorphic to traditional dependency graphs (see Figure 3), or ungrounded, as in Figure 4, in which case they capture parser states in which some structure has been predicted, but not yet found.

For example, an Earley PREDICTOR step is tied to a particular grammar rule, and can only be executed if such a rule exists. Some dependency parsers are also grammardriven. For example, those described by Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), Barbero et al. (1998), and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of dependency grammar CFG-like rules described by Hays (1964) and Gaifman (1965).

For simplicity of presentation, we will only use this representation (called extended dependency trees) in the grammar-based algorithms that need it, and we will define the formalism and the rest of the algorithms with simple dependency trees. Some existing dependency parsing algorithms, for example, the algorithm of Eisner (1996), involve steps that connect spans which can represent disconnected dependency graphs. Such spans cannot be represented by 543 Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 3 a single dependency tree. Therefore, our formalism allows items to be sets of forests of partial dependency trees, rather than sets of trees. We are now ready to define the concepts needed to specify item sets for dependency parsers.

The side conditions provide an explicit representation of the choice points where probabilistic decisions are made by the control mechanism that is executing the schema. The same principle applies to all D-rule-based parsers described in this article. 3.2 Eisner (1996) Based on the number of free variables used in deduction steps of Collins’s parser, it is apparent that its time complexity is O(n5): There are O(n5) combinations of index values with which each of its LINK steps can be executed.5 This complexity arises because a parentless word (head) may appear in any position in the items generated by the parser; the complexity can be reduced to O(n3) by ensuring that parentless words only appear at the first or last position of an item.

Proving Correctness Another use of the parsing schemata framework is that it is helpful in establishing the correctness of a parser. Furthermore, relations between schemata can be used to establish the correctness of one schema from that of related ones.

To verify soundness we need to check that every individual deduction step in the parser infers a coherent consequent item when applied to coherent antecedents (i.e., in this case, that steps always generate non-empty items that conform to the definition in Section 3.3). This is shown by checking that, given two antecedents of a deduction step that contain a tree licensed by a set of D-rules G, the consequent of the step also contains such a tree. The tr</context>

The forest {U1, U2} belongs to the coherent item [i,j], and {U3, T2} belongs to the coherent item [j, k]. From these two items, we can obtain [i, k] by using the L-LINK step. Symmetric reasoning can be applied if i has no right dependents but k has at least one left dependent, analogously to the case of the previous parser. ■ Theorem 5 The Eisner (1996) parsing schema is correct.

Final items: The set of final items is {[0, n, False, True]}. Note that these items represent dependency trees rooted at the beginning-of-sentence marker 0, which acts as a “dummy head” for the sentence. In order for the algorithm to parse sentences correctly, we need to define D-rules to allow the real sentence head to be linked to the node 0. 3.3 Eisner and Satta (1999) Eisner and Satta (1999) define an O(n3) parser for split head automaton grammars which can be used for dependency parsing. This algorithm is conceptually simpler than Eisner’s (1996) algorithm, because it only uses items representing single dependency trees, avoiding items of the form [i, j, False, False]. Item set: The item set is ZES99 = {[i, j, i] |0 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; n} U {[i, j, j] |0 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; n}, where items are defined as in Collins’s parsing schema.

COMBINER steps follow the same mechanism as those in the algorithm of Eisner (1996), and LINK steps work analogously to those of Collins (1996), so this schema can be seen as being intermediate between those two algorithms. These relationships will be formally described in Section 4. Final items: The set of final items is {[0,n,0]}. By convention, parse trees have the beginning-of-sentence marker 0 as their head, as in the previous algorithm. When described for head automaton grammars (Eisner and Satta 1999), this algorithm appears to be more complex to understand and implement than the previous one, requiring four different kinds of items to keep track of the state of the automata used by the grammars. However, this abstract representation of its underlying semantics reveals that this parsing strategy is, in fact, conceptually simpler for dependency parsing. 3.4 Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) define a deterministic, shift-reduce dependency parser guided by support vector machines, which achieves over 90% dependency accuracy on Section 23 of the Wall Street Journal Penn T</context>

Developing efficient dependency parsing strategies for these sets of structures has considerable practical interest, in particular, making it possible to parse directly with dependencies in a data-driven manner rather than indirectly by constructing intermediate constituency grammars and extracting dependencies from constituency parses. In this section, we make four contributions to this enterprise. Firstly, we define a parser for well-nested structures of gap degree 1, and prove its correctness. The parser runs in time O(n7), the same complexity as the best existing algorithms for LTAG (Eisner and Satta 2000), and can be optimized to O(n6) in the nonlexicalized case. Secondly, we generalize our algorithm to any well-nested dependency structure with gap degree at most k, resulting in an algorithm with time complexity O(n5+2k). Thirdly, we generalize the previous parsers in order to include ill-nested structures with gap degree at most k satisfying certain constraints, giving a parser that runs in time O(n4+3k). Note that parsing unrestricted ill-nested structures, even when the gap degree is bounded, is NP-complete: These structures are equivalent to LCFRS for which the recognition problem is NP-co</context>

This complexity with respect to the length of the 568 G´omez-Rodriguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata input is as expected for this set of structures, because Kuhlmann (2010) shows that they are equivalent to LTAG, and the best existing parsers for this formalism also perform in O(n7) (Eisner and Satta 2000).9 Note that the COMBINE step that is the bottleneck only uses seven indices, not any additional entities such as D-rules. Hence, the O(n7) complexity does not involve additional factors relating to grammar size. Given unlexicalized D-rules specifying the possibility of dependencies between pairs of categories rather than pairs of words, a variant of this parser can be constructed with time complexity O(n6), as with parsers for unlexicalized TAG.

Note that this set is the same as in WG1, as these are the items that we denoted [1, n, h, o, o] in that parser. 9 Although standard TAG parsing algorithms run in time O(n6) with respect to the input length, they also have a complexity factor related to grammar size.

Traditional parsing schemata are used to define grammar-driven parsers, in which the parsing process is guided by some set of rules which are used to license deduction steps. For example, an Earley PREDICTOR step is tied to a particular grammar rule, and can only be executed if such a rule exists. Some dependency parsers are also grammardriven. For example, those described by Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), Barbero et al. (1998), and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of dependency grammar CFG-like rules described by Hays (1964) and Gaifman (1965). However, many of the algorithms (Eisner 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003) are not traditionally considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar; decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilistic models (Eisner 1996) or classifiers (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003). These are called data-driven parsers. To express such algorithms as deduction systems, we use the notion of D-rules (Covington 1990). D-rules have the form (a, i) → (b, j), which specifies that a word b located at position j in the input string can have the word a</context>

Other parsers, such as that of Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), use grammars with CFG-like rules which encode the preferred order of dependents for each given governor. For example, a rule of the form N(Det * PP) is used to allow N to have Det as left dependent and PP as right dependent. The algorithm by Lombardo and Lesmo is a version of Earley’s CFG parser (Earley 1970) that uses Gaifman’s dependency grammar (Gaifman 1965). As this algorithm predicts dependency relations before building them, item sets contain extended dependency trees, trees that have two kinds of nodes: preterminal nodes and terminal nodes. Depending on whether all the preterminal nodes have been linked to terminals, extended dependency trees can either be grounded, in which case they are isomorphic to traditional dependency graphs (see Figure 3), or ungrounded, as in Figure 4, in which case they capture parser states in which some structure has been predicted, but not yet found.

Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Parsing For reasons of computational efficiency, many practical implementations of dependency parsing are restricted to projective structures. However, some natural language sentences appear to have non-projective syntactic structure, something that arises in many languages (Havelka 2007), and is particularly common in free word order languages such as Czech. Parsing without the projectivity constraint is computationally complex: Although it is possible to parse non-projective structures in quadratic time with respect to input length under a model in which each dependency decision is independent of all the others (as in the parser of McDonald et al. [2005], discussed in Section 6.4), the problem is intractable in the absence of this assumption (McDonald and Satta 2007).

Traditional parsing schemata are used to define grammar-driven parsers, in which the parsing process is guided by some set of rules which are used to license deduction steps. For example, an Earley PREDICTOR step is tied to a particular grammar rule, and can only be executed if such a rule exists. Some dependency parsers are also grammardriven. For example, those described by Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), Barbero et al. (1998), and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of dependency grammar CFG-like rules described by Hays (1964) and Gaifman (1965). However, many of the algorithms (Eisner 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003) are not traditionally considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar; decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilistic models (Eisner 1996) or classifiers (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003). These are called data-driven parsers. To express such algorithms as deduction systems, we use the notion of D-rules (Covington 1990). D-rules have the form (a, i) → (b, j), which specifies that a word b located at position j in the input string </context>

As in the case of WG1, the step with most free variables is COMBINE SHRINKING GAP CENTRE with 5 + 2k free indices. Again, this complexity result is in line with what could be expected from previous research in constituency parsing: Kuhlmann (2010) shows that the set of well-nested dependency structures with gap degree at most k is closely related to coupled CFG in which the maximal rank of a nonterminal is k + 1. The constituency parser defined by Hotz and Pitsch (1996) for these grammars also adds an n2 factor for each unit increment of k. Note that a small value of k appears to be sufficient to account for the vast majority of the non-projective sentences found in natural language treebanks. For instance, the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc et al. 2006) contains no structures with gap degree greater than 4. Thus, a WG4 parser would be able to analyze all the well-nested structures in this treebank, which represent 99.89% of the total (WG1 would be able to parse 99.49%). Increasing k beyond 4 would not produce further improvements in coverage. 7.7 Parsin</context>

Link Grammar Schemata Link Grammar (LG), introduced by Sleator and Temperley (1991, 1993), is a theory of syntax whose structural representation of sentences is closely related to projective dependency representations, but with some important differences.11 Undirected links: Like dependency formalisms, LG represents the structure of sentences as a set of links between words. However, whereas dependency links are directed, the links used in LG are undirected: There is no distinction made between heads and dependents. 10 Arabic (Hajiˇc et al. 2004), Czech (Hajiˇc et al. 2006), Danish (Kromann 2003), Dutch (van der Beek et al. 2002), Latin (Bamman and Crane 2006), Portuguese (Afonso et al. 2002), Slovene (Dˇzeroski et al. 2006), Swedish (Nilsson, Hall, and Nivre 2005), and Turkish (Atalay, Oflazer, and Say 2003; Oflazer et al. 2003). 11 A complete treatment of LG is beyond the scope of this article: Schneider (1998) gives a detailed comparison of Link Grammar and dependency formalisms. 575 Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 3 Table 1 Counts of dependency structures in treebanks for several languages, classified by projectivity, gap degree, and mild and strong ill-nestedness (for</context>

Conclusions and Future Work The parsing schemata formalism of Sikkel (1997) has previously been used to define, analyze, and compare algorithms for constituency-based parsing. We have shown how to extend the formalism to dependency parsers, as well as the related Link Grammar formalism. Deductive approaches have been used in the past to describe individual dependency parsers: In Kuhlmann (2007, 2010) a grammatical deduction system was used to define a parser for regular dependency grammars. 581 Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 3 McDonald and Nivre (2007) give an alternative framework for dependency parsers, viewing them as transition systems. That model is based on parser configurations and transitions, and has no clear relationship to the approach described here. To demonstrate the theoretical uses of dependency parsing schemata, we have used them to describe a wide range of existing projective and non-projective dependency parsers.

Therefore, a postprocessing mechanism is needed to determine which of the generated structures are, in fact, valid trees. In the parsing schema, this is reflected by the fact that the schema is complete but not sound. Nivre (2007) uses a variant of this algorithm in which cycle detection is used to avoid generating incorrect structures. Other non-projective parsers not covered here can also be represented under the parsing schema framework. For example, Kuhlmann (2010) presents a deduction system for a non-projective parser which uses a grammar formalism called regular dependency grammars. This deduction system can easily be converted into a parsing schema by associating adequate semantics with items. However, we do not show this here for space reasons, because we would first have to explain the formalism of regular dependency grammars. 7.

[2005], discussed in Section 6.4), the problem is intractable in the absence of this assumption (McDonald and Satta 2007). Nivre and Nilsson (2005) observe that most non-projective dependency structures appearing in practice contain only small proportions of non-projective arcs. This has led to the study of sub-classes of the class of all non-projective dependency structures (Kuhlmann and Nivre 2006; Havelka 2007). Kuhlmann (2010) investigates several such classes, based on well-nestedness and gap degree constraints (Bodirsky, Kuhlmann, and M¨ohl 2005), relating them to lexicalized constituency grammar formalisms. Specifically, Kuhlmann shows that linear context-free rewriting systems [i, ] (h1, ... , hj−1, hj+1, ... , hk)] 562 G´omez-Rodriguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata (LCFRS) with fan-out k (Vijay-Shanker, Weir, and Joshi 1987; Satta 1992) induce the set of dependency structures with gap degree at most k − 1; coupled CFG in which the maximal rank of a nonterminal is k (Hotz and Pitsch 1996) induc</context>

We have p &gt; 1, because by hypothesis #(Lh]) &gt; 1. With this, the induction step proof is divided into two cases, according to whether p = 1 or p &gt; 1. When p = 1, the item that Lemma 1 associates with the subtree of T induced by the single direct dependent of h is known to be derivable by the induction hypothesis. It can be shown case by case that the item corresponding to h by Lemma 1 can be inferred using LINK steps, thus completing the case for p = 1. For p &gt; 1, we use the concept of order annotations (Kuhlmann and M¨ohl 2007; Kuhlmann 2010). Order annotations are strings that encode the precedence relation between the nodes of a dependency tree. The order annotation for a given node encodes the shape (with respect to this precedence relation) of the projection of each of the children of that node, that is, the number of intervals in each projection, the number of gaps, and the way in which intervals and gaps are interleaved. The concepts of projectivity, gap degree, and well-nestedness are associated with particular constraints on order annotations. The completeness proof for p &gt; 1 is divided into cases according to the order an</context>

Using the induction hypotheses and some relevant properties of order annotations we find that, for each of this cases, we can find a sequence of COMBINE steps to infer the item corresponding to T from smaller coherent items. ■ 7.3 Computational Complexity of WG1 The time complexity of WG1 is O(n7), as the step COMBINE SHRINKING GAP CENTRE works with seven free string positions. This complexity with respect to the length of the 568 G´omez-Rodriguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata input is as expected for this set of structures, because Kuhlmann (2010) shows that they are equivalent to LTAG, and the best existing parsers for this formalism also perform in O(n7) (Eisner and Satta 2000).9 Note that the COMBINE step that is the bottleneck only uses seven indices, not any additional entities such as D-rules. Hence, the O(n7) complexity does not involve additional factors relating to grammar size. Given unlexicalized D-rules specifying the possibility of dependencies between pairs of categories rather than pairs of words, a variant of this parser can be constructed with time complexity O(n6), as with parsers for unlexicalized TAG.

In the case for p ≥ 1, we also base our proof on the order annotation for h, but we have to take into account that the set of possible annotations is larger when we allow the gap degree to be greater than 1, so we must consider more cases in this part of the proof. 7.6 Computational Complexity of WGk The WGk parser runs in time O(n5+2k). As in the case of WG1, the step with most free variables is COMBINE SHRINKING GAP CENTRE with 5 + 2k free indices. Again, this complexity result is in line with what could be expected from previous research in constituency parsing: Kuhlmann (2010) shows that the set of well-nested dependency structures with gap degree at most k is closely related to coupled CFG in which the maximal rank of a nonterminal is k + 1. The constituency parser defined by Hotz and Pitsch (1996) for these grammars also adds an n2 factor for each unit increment of k. Note that a small value of k appears to be sufficient to account for the vast majority of the non-projective sentences found in natural language treebanks. For instance, the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc et al. 2006) contains no structures with gap degree greater than 4. Thus, a WG4 parser woul</context>

The reason for this complexity is the problem of unrestricted crossing configurations, appearing when dependency subtrees are allowed to interleave in every possible way. Ill-nested structures can be parsed in polynomial time with bounds on the gap degree and the number of dependents allowed per node: Kuhlmann (2010) presents a parser based on this idea, using a kind of grammar that resembles LCFRS, called regular dependency grammar. This parser is exponential in the gap degree, as well as in the maximum number of dependents allowed per node: Its complexity is O(nk(m+1)), where k is the maximum gap degree and m is the maximum number of dependents per node. In contrast, the parsers presented here are data-driven and thus do not need an explicit grammar.

We begin by addressing a number of preliminary issues. Traditional parsing schemata are used to define grammar-driven parsers, in which the parsing process is guided by some set of rules which are used to license deduction steps. For example, an Earley PREDICTOR step is tied to a particular grammar rule, and can only be executed if such a rule exists. Some dependency parsers are also grammardriven. For example, those described by Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), Barbero et al. (1998), and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of dependency grammar CFG-like rules described by Hays (1964) and Gaifman (1965). However, many of the algorithms (Eisner 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003) are not traditionally considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar; decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilistic models (Eisner 1996) or classifiers (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003). These are called data-driven parsers. To express such algorithms as deduction systems, we u</context>

Additionally, D-rules allow us to use an uniform description that is valid for both data-driven and grammar-driven parsers, because D-rules can function like grammatical rules. The fundamental structures in dependency parsing are dependency trees. Therefore, just as items for constituency parsers encode sets of partial constituency trees, items for dependency parsers can be defined using partial dependency trees. However, dependency trees cannot express the fact that a particular structure has been predicted, but not yet built; this is required for grammar-based algorithms such as those of Lombardo and Lesmo (1996) and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998). The formalism can be made general enough to include these parsers by using a novel way of representing intermediate states of dependency parsers based on a form of dependency trees that include nodes labelled with preterminals and terminals (G´omez-Rodr´ıguez, Carroll, and Weir 2008; G´omez-Rodr´ıguez 2009). For simplicity of presentation, we will only use this representation (called extended dependency trees) in the grammar-based algorithms that need it, and we will define the formalism and the rest of the algorithms with simple dependency trees.

If the grammar satisfies this condition, it is trivial to see that every forest in an item of the form [0, n + 1] must contain a parse tree rooted at the beginning-of-sentence marker and with yield 0..n. As can be seen from the schema, this algorithm requires less bookkeeping than the other parsers described here. 3.5 Lombardo and Lesmo (1996) and Other Earley-Based Parsers The algorithms presented so far are based on making individual decisions about dependency links, represented by D-rules. Other parsers, such as that of Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), use grammars with CFG-like rules which encode the preferred order of dependents for each given governor. For example, a rule of the form N(Det * PP) is used to allow N to have Det as left dependent and PP as right dependent. The algorithm by Lombardo and Lesmo is a version of Earley’s CFG parser (Earley 1970) that uses Gaifman’s dependency grammar (Gaifman 1965). As this algorithm predi</context>

We now show that the dependency parsing schema formalism can also describe various non-projective parsers. 6.1 Pseudo-Projectivity Pseudo-projective parsers generate non-projective analyses in polynomial time by using a projective parsing strategy and postprocessing the results to establish non-projective links. This projective parsing strategy can be represented by dependency parsing schemata such as those seen in Section 3. For example, the algorithm of Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) uses a strategy similar to Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), but with the following initializer step instead of the INITTER and PREDICTOR: INITTER: [A(�α), i, i � 1]A(α) E P n 1 &lt; i &lt; n The initialization step specified by Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) differs from this (directly consuming a nonterminal from the input) but this gives an incomplete algorithm. The problem can be fixed either by using the step shown here instead (bottom–up Earley strategy) or by adding an additional step turning it into a bottom–up left-corner parser. 6.2 Attardi (2006) The non-projective parser of Attardi (2006) extends the algorithm of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), ad</context>

Conclusions and Future Work The parsing schemata formalism of Sikkel (1997) has previously been used to define, analyze, and compare algorithms for constituency-based parsing. We have shown how to extend the formalism to dependency parsers, as well as the related Link Grammar formalism. Deductive approaches have been used in the past to describe individual dependency parsers: In Kuhlmann (2007, 2010) a grammatical deduction system was used to define a parser for regular dependency grammars. 581 Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 3 McDonald and Nivre (2007) give an alternative framework for dependency parsers, viewing them as transition systems. That model is based on parser configurations and transitions, and has no clear relationship to the approach described here. To demonstrate the theoretical uses of dependency parsing schemata, we have used them to describe a wide range of existing projective and non-projective dependency parsers. We have also clarified various relations between parsers which were originally formulated very differently—for example, establishing the relation between the dynamic programming algorithm of Eisner (1996) and the</context>

Sikkel 1997), with minor changes to adapt it to dependency grammar (for example, the SCANNER always moves the dot over the head symbol *, rather than over a terminal symbol). Analogously, other dependency parsing schemata based on CFG-like rules can be obtained by modifying CFG parsing schemata of Sikkel (1997): The algorithm of Barbero et al. (1998) can be obtained from the left-corner parser, and the parser described by Courtin and Genthial (1998) is a variant of the head-corner parser. 3.6 Nivre (2003) Nivre (2003) describes a shift-reduce algorithm for projective dependency parsing, later extended by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004). With linear-time performance and competitive parsing accuracy (Nivre et al. 2006; Nivre and McDonald 2008), it is one of the parsers included in the MaltParser system (Nivre et al. 2007), which is currently widely used (e.g., Nivre et al. 2007; Surdeanu et al. 2008). The parser proceeds by reading the sentence from left to right, using a stack and four different kinds of transitions between configurations. The transition system defined by all the possible confi</context>

For instance, the structure shown in Figure 5 cannot be parsed because the constraints imposed by the algorithm prevent it from finding the head of 4. The MaltParser system (Nivre et al. 2007) includes an implementation of a complete variant of Covington’s LSUP parser where these constraints have been relaxed. This implementation has the same tree building logic as the parser described by Nivre (2003), differing from it only with respect to the control structure. Thus, it can be seen as a different realization of the schema shown in Section 3.6. 4. Relations Between Dependency Parsers The parsing schemata framework can be exploited to establish how different algorithms are related, improving our understanding of the features of these parsers, and potentially exposing new algorithms that combine characteristics of existing parsers in novel ways. Sikkel (1994) defines various relations between schemata that fall into two categories: generalization relations, which are used to obtain more fin</context>

An alternative generalization of the concept of well-nestedness has recently been introduced by Maier and Lichte (2011). The definition of this property of structures, called k-ill-nestedness, is more declarative than that of mildly ill-nestedness. However, it is based on properties that are not local to projections or subtrees, and there is no evidence that k-ill-nested structures are parsable in polynomial time. Finally, we observe that that some well-known parsing algorithms discussed here (Nivre 2003; McDonald et al. 2005) rely on statistically-driven control mechanisms that fall below the abstraction level of parsing schemata. Therefore, it would be useful to have an extension of parsing schemata allowing the description and comparison of these control structures in a general way.

Note that this parsing schema is not correct, because Covington’s algorithm does not prevent the generation of cycles in the dependency graphs it produces. Quoting Covington (2001, page 99), Because the parser operates one word at a time, unity can only be checked at the end of the whole process: did it produce a tree with a single root that comprises all of the words? Therefore, a postprocessing mechanism is needed to determine which of the generated structures are, in fact, valid trees. In the parsing schema, this is reflected by the fact that the schema is complete but not sound. Nivre (2007) uses a variant of this algorithm in which cycle detection is used to avoid generating incorrect structures. Other non-projective parsers not covered here can also be represented under the parsing schema framework. For example, Kuhlmann (2010) presents a deduction system for a non-projective parser which uses a grammar formalism called regular dependency grammars. This deduction system can easily be converted into a parsing schema by associating adequate semantics with items. However, we do not show this here for space reasons, because we would first have to explain the formalism of regular de</context>

Conclusions and Future Work The parsing schemata formalism of Sikkel (1997) has previously been used to define, analyze, and compare algorithms for constituency-based parsing. We have shown how to extend the formalism to dependency parsers, as well as the related Link Grammar formalism. Deductive approaches have been used in the past to describe individual dependency parsers: In Kuhlmann (2007, 2010) a grammatical deduction system was used to define a parser for regular dependency grammars. 581 Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 3 McDonald and Nivre (2007) give an alternative framework for dependency parsers, viewing them as transition systems. That model is based on parser configurations and transitions, and has no clear relationship to the approach described here. To demonstrate the theoretical uses of dependency parsing schemata, we have used them to describe a wide range of existing projective and non-projective dependency parsers. We have also clarified various relations between parsers which were originally formulated very differently—for example, establishing the relation between the dynamic programming algorithm of Eisner (1996) and the</context>

(2005) describe a parser which finds a nonprojective analysis for a sentence in O(n2) time under a strong independence assumption called an edgefactored model: Each dependency decision is assumed to be independent of all the others (McDonald and Satta 2007). Despite the restrictiveness of this model, this maximum spanning tree (MST) parser achieves state-of-the-art performance for projective and non-projective structures (Che et al. 2008; Nivre and McDonald 2008; Surdeanu et al. 2008). The parser considers the weighted graph formed by all the possible dependencies between pairs of input words, and applies an MST algorithm to find a dependency tree covering all the words in the sentence and maximizing the sum of weights. The MST algorithm for directed graphs suggested by McDonald et al.

Parsing without the projectivity constraint is computationally complex: Although it is possible to parse non-projective structures in quadratic time with respect to input length under a model in which each dependency decision is independent of all the others (as in the parser of McDonald et al. [2005], discussed in Section 6.4), the problem is intractable in the absence of this assumption (McDonald and Satta 2007). Nivre and Nilsson (2005) observe that most non-projective dependency structures appearing in practice contain only small proportions of non-projective arcs. This has led to the study of sub-classes of the class of all non-projective dependency structures (Kuhlmann and Nivre 2006; Havelka 2007). Kuhlmann (2010) investigates several such classes, based on well-nestedness and gap degree constraints (Bodirsky, Kuhlmann, and M¨ohl 2005), relating them to lexicalized constituency grammar formalisms.

Furthermore, they are able to parse dependency structures with any number of dependents per node, and their computational complexity is independent of this parameter m. In line with the observation that most non-projective structures appearing in practice are only “slightly” non-projective (Nivre and Nilsson 2005), we characterize a sense in which the structures appearing in treebanks are only “slightly” ill-nested.

Thirdly, we generalize the previous parsers in order to include ill-nested structures with gap degree at most k satisfying certain constraints, giving a parser that runs in time O(n4+3k). Note that parsing unrestricted ill-nested structures, even when the gap degree is bounded, is NP-complete: These structures are equivalent to LCFRS for which the recognition problem is NP-complete (Satta 1992). Finally, we characterize the set of structures covered by this parser, which we call mildly ill-nested structures, and show that it includes all the trees present in a number of dependency treebanks. We now define the concepts of gap degree and well-nestedness (Kuhlmann and Nivre 2006). Let T be a dependency tree for the string w1 ... wn: Definition 5 The gap degree of a node k in T is the minimum g E (IN U {0}) such that Lk] (the projection of the node k) can be written as the union of g + 1 intervals, that is, the number of discontinuities in Lk].

Although this covers the vast majority of the structures that occur in natural language treebanks (Kuhlmann and Nivre 2006), a significant number of sentences contain ill-nested structures. Maier and Lichte (2011) provide examples of some linguistic phenomena that cause ill-nestedness. Unfortunately, the general problem of parsing ill-nested structures is NP-complete, even when the gap degree is bounded. This set of structures is closely related to LCFRS with bounded fan-out and unbounded production length, and parsing in this formalism is known to be NP-complete (Satta 1992). The reason for this complexity is the problem of unrestricted crossing configurations, appearing when dependency subtrees are allowed to interleave in every possible way. Ill-nested structures can be parsed in polynomial time with bounds on the gap degree and the number of dependents allowed per node: Kuhlmann (2010) presents a parser based on this idea, using a kind of grammar that resembles LCFRS, called regular dependency grammar. This parser is exponential in the gap degree, as well as in the maximum number of dependents allowed per node: Its complexity is O(nk(m+1)), where k is the maxi</context>

The notion of a parsing schema comes from considering parsing as a deduction process which generates intermediate results called items. In particular, items in parsing schemata are sets of partial constituency trees taken from the set of all partial parse trees that do not violate the constraints imposed by a grammar. A parsing schema can be used to obtain a working implementation of a parser by using deductive engines such as the ones described by Shieber et al. (1995) and G´omez-Rodrfguez, Vilares, and Alonso (2009), or the Dyna language (Eisner, Goldlust, and Smith 2005). 2. Dependency Parsing Schemata Although parsing schemata were originally defined for CFG parsers, they have since been adapted to other constituency-based grammar formalisms. This involves finding 542 G´omez-Rodriguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata a suitable definition of the set of structures contained in items, and a way to define deduction steps that captures the formalism’s composition rules (Alonso et al. 1999). Although it is less clear how to adapt parsing schemat</context>

For example, an Earley PREDICTOR step is tied to a particular grammar rule, and can only be executed if such a rule exists. Some dependency parsers are also grammardriven. For example, those described by Lombardo and Lesmo (1996), Barbero et al. (1998), and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of dependency grammar CFG-like rules described by Hays (1964) and Gaifman (1965). However, many of the algorithms (Eisner 1996; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003) are not traditionally considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar; decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilistic models (Eisner 1996) or classifiers (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003). These are called data-driven parsers. To express such algorithms as deduction systems, we use the notion of D-rules (Covington 1990). D-rules have the form (a, i) → (b, j), which specifies that a word b located at position j in the input string can have the word a in position i as a dependent. Deduction steps in data-driven parsers can </context>

Definition 4 Let δ(G) be the set of dependency trees which are syntactically well-formed according to a given grammar G (which may be a grammar of D-rules or of CFG-like rules, as explained previously). We define an item set for dependency parsing as a set I ⊆ H, where H is a partition of the power set, (δ(G)), of the set δ(G). Each element of I, called an item, is a set of dependency forests for strings. For example, each member of the item [1,5] in the item set of the parser by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) that will be explained in Section 3.4 is a dependency forest with two projective trees, one with head 1 and the other with head 5, and such that the concatenation of their yields is 1..5. Figure 1 shows the three dependency forests that constitute the contents of this item under a specific grammar of D-rules. Following Sikkel (1997), items are sets of syntactic structures and tuples are a shorthand notation for such sets, as seen in the previous example. An alternative approach, 1 Note that the trees in a dependency forest can have different yields, because the node set of a dependency tree f</context>

By convention, parse trees have the beginning-of-sentence marker 0 as their head, as in the previous algorithm. When described for head automaton grammars (Eisner and Satta 1999), this algorithm appears to be more complex to understand and implement than the previous one, requiring four different kinds of items to keep track of the state of the automata used by the grammars. However, this abstract representation of its underlying semantics reveals that this parsing strategy is, in fact, conceptually simpler for dependency parsing. 3.4 Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) define a deterministic, shift-reduce dependency parser guided by support vector machines, which achieves over 90% dependency accuracy on Section 23 of the Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank. Parsing schemata cannot specify control strategies that guide deterministic parsers; schemata work at an abstraction level, defining a set of operations without procedural constraints on the order in which they are applied. However, deterministic parsers can be viewed as optimizations of underlying nondeterministic algorithms, and we can represent the actions of the underlying p</context>

Sikkel (1994) explains the distinction between static and dynamic filtering, which is not used here. • Item contraction: The inverse of item refinement: P1 −→ P2 if P2 ic −→ P1. ir • Step contraction: The inverse of step refinement: P1 −→P2 if P2 sc −→P1. sr Many of the parsing schemata described in Section 3 can be related (see Figure 6), but for space reasons we sketch proofs for only the more interesting cases. Theorem 1 Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) sr−→ Eisner (1996). Proof 1 It is easy to see from the schema definitions that IYM03 ⊆ IEis96. We must verify that every deduction step in the Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) schema can be emulated by a sequence of inferences in the Eisner (1996) schema. For the INITTER step this is trivial as the INITTERs of both parsers are equivalent. Expressing the R-LINK step of Yamada and Matsumoto’s parser in the notation used for Eisner items gives: [i, j, False, False] [j, k, False, False] R-Link (wj, j) → (wk, k) [i, k, False, False] This can be emulated in Eisner’s parser by an R-LINK step followed by </context>

As for the R-COMBINER and L-COMBINER steps in Eisner and Satta’s parser, it is easy to see that they are particular cases of the COMBINESPANS step in Eisner’s, and therefore can be emulated by a single application of COMBINESPANS. ■ Note that, in practice, these two relations mean that the parsers by Eisner and Satta (1999) and Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) are more efficient, at the schema level, than that of Eisner (1996), in that they generate fewer items and need fewer steps to perform the same deductions. These two parsers also have the interesting property that they use disjoint item sets (one uses items representing trees while the other uses items representing pairs of trees); and the union of these disjoint sets is the item set used by Eisner’s parser. The optimization in Yamada and Matsumoto’s parser comes from contracting deductions in Eisner’s parser so that linking operations are immediately followed by combining operations; whereas</context>

These dependency parsing schemata are versions of the homonymous schemata whose complete description can be found in Sikkel (1997), adapted for dependency parsing. G´omez-Rodr´ıguez (2009) gives a more thorough explanation of these relations and schemata. 5. Proving Correctness Another use of the parsing schemata framework is that it is helpful in establishing the correctness of a parser. Furthermore, relations between schemata can be used to establish the correctness of one schema from that of related ones. In this section, we show that the schemata for Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and Eisner and Satta (1999) are correct, and use this to prove the correctness of the schema for Eisner (1996). Theorem 3 The Eisner and Satta (1999) parsing schema is correct. Proof 3 To prove correctness, we must show both soundness and completeness. To verify soundness we need to check that every individual deduction step in the parser infers a coherent consequent item when applied to coherent antecedents (i.e., in this case, that steps always generate non-empty items that conform to the definition in Section 3.3). This is shown by checking that, given two antecedents of a deduction step t</context>

Because these three items have a length strictly less than l, by the inductive hypothesis, they are derivable. Thus the item [i, k, i] is also derivable, as it can be obtained from these derivable items by the following inferences: [i,l − 1, i], [l, j, j] �- [i, j, i] (by the L-LINK step) [i, j, i], [j, k, j] �- [i, k, i] (by the L-COMBINER step) This proves that all coherent items of length l which are of the form [i, k, i] are derivable under the induction hypothesis. The same can be shown for items of the form [i, k, k] by symmetric reasoning. ■ Theorem 4 The Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) parsing schema is correct. Proof 4 Soundness is verified by building forests for the consequents of steps from those corresponding to the antecedents. To prove completeness we use strong induction on the length of items, where the length of an item [i, j] is defined as j − i + 1. The induction step involves considering any coherent item [i, k] of length l &gt; 2 (l = 2 is the base case here because items of length 2 are generated by the Initter step) and showing that it can be inferred from derivable antecedents of length less than l, so it is derivable.

The problem can be fixed either by using the step shown here instead (bottom–up Earley strategy) or by adding an additional step turning it into a bottom–up left-corner parser. 6.2 Attardi (2006) The non-projective parser of Attardi (2006) extends the algorithm of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), adding additional shift and reduce actions to handle non-projective dependency structures. These extra actions allow the parser to link to nodes that are several positions deep in the stack, creating non-projective links. In particular, Attardi uses six non-projective actions: two actions to link to nodes that are two positions deep, another two actions for nodes that are three positions deep, and a third pair of actions that generalizes the previous ones to n positions deep for any n. Thus, the maximum depth in the stack to which links can be created can be configured according to the actio</context>

The MH∞ parser, obtained by assuming that the number of trees per forest is unbounded, is equivalent to Att∞, and therefore correct with respect to 560 G´omez-Rodriguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata the set of non-projective dependency structures. For finite values of k, MHd+2 is a static filter of Attd, because its sets of items and deduction steps are subsets of those of Attd. Therefore, the set of structures parsed by MHd+2 is also a subset of those parsed by Attd. The complexity of the MHk parser is O(nk). For k = 3, MH3 is a step refinement of the parser by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) that parses projective structures only, but by modifying the bound k we can define polynomial-time algorithms that parse larger sets of non-projective dependency structures. The MHk parser has the property of being able to parse any possible dependency structure as long as we make k large enough. 6.4 MST Parser (McDonald et al. 2005) McDonald et al.

This contrasts with many of the 577 Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 3 dependency parsers seen in previous sections (Eisner 1996; Eisner and Satta 1999; Yamada and Matsumoto 2003), which build dependency graphs bottom–up.
