it is tempting to suggest that a different treatment in the
user-access issues of lexical entry, word processing for
post-editing, and fail-soft outputs might have affected
the outcome favorably.
Jonathan Slocum, &amp;quot;A machine(-aided) translation bib-
liography&amp;quot;
The third paper in which Slocum was involved is a
bibliography of machine translation, including machine-
assisted translation and terminological studies. Perhaps
the most up-to-date piece in the volume, this is another
candidate for periodic updating, and constitutes by itself
a sufficient justification for acquiring the volume.
Machine translation systems is a valuable collection
of papers gathered with a view toward relating the
research models with both commercial production
needs and existing production systems. The criteria for
success of a system-oriented project must, as Slocum
maintains, focus on the comparison of system perfor-
mance against human performance, taking into account
the processes that both methods share. It is hoped that
the perspectives of this volume will persist, whether in
future collections, or in an updated version of this one.

research and development since 1977, and was project man-

Useful survey books devoted to problems of natural
language understanding and computational linguistics
make use of several main approaches to the presenta-

• Illustrating concrete research with a chosen formal-

• The two above-mentioned modes of description can
be combined with the enumeration of problems that
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983399684210526">
are still unsolved but crucial for the progress of
research.
Noble&apos;s book Natural language processing is a success-
ful combination of all three approaches, each of them
dominating in different parts of the book.
Part 1 presents a description of an extremely simple
NLP system by means of the ATN formalism and the
programming language POP-11 (partly Prolog, too). The
result of the operation of the system—which later is
described consistently in a highly limited microworld,
adhering to the principle &amp;quot;from the simple to the
complex&amp;quot;—is the parsing of basic English syntactic
structures of the simple sentence. The presentation is a
typical illustration of the first approach listed above.
The author displays an admirable ability to introduce
the reader to serious linguistic problems, each of them
worthy of separate treatises (e.g., the formalized de-
scription of the English temporal systems) within a
microworld consisting of three points, connected by a
line.
Part 2 is an enquiry into the semantics of NLP
systems (making use of the second approach). Several
alternative means, already successfully adopted in AI
systems, are proposed. These proposed means are
aimed at overcoming the incompleteness of the linguis-
tic description proposed in Part I. For the purpose of
successively acquainting the reader with these means,
the following model of presentation is used: every new
approach suggests means of overcoming the failures of
the previous one. The order is thus: case grammar,
frames., scripts and plans, and conceptual dependen-
cies. At this stage, the illustrations do not contain
concrete programs, but rather only examples for the
operation of the basic formalisms.
Part 3 (where application aspects have definitely
moved to the background) is an attempt to analyze
various aspects of real NLU, i.e., natural language
understanding by people. Raising the slogan to work out
a theory of semantic presentation, already unlimited by
concrete microworlds, and at the same time proposing a
formalism of his own for such a presentation, the author
leaves the field of Al systems and enters the sphere of
the cognitive and pragmatic. A large number of prob-
lems are touched upon: perception, motivation, causa-
tion, models of communication, knowledge acquisition,
metasemantic problems, cognitive aspects of truth,
falsehood, negation, quantification, and others. Since
only 73 pages are devoted to this huge amount of
problems, the authOr obviously only manages to draw
our attention to summits that are yet to be conquered,
not only through CL and AI, but also through general
linguistics. The height of these summits clearly demon-
strates the distance that is yet to be covered in order to
achieve real NLU modeling.
Though extremely concise, the presentation in this
part of the book, with the impressive range of problems
discussed brought together by a unified philosophical

treatment, is of interest for a large number of special-
ists.
The other two parts of the book make it a good
textbook, too, mainly of Al and for computer scientists
above all, having access to POP-11 (as well as VAX,
Sun, Hewlett-Packard, Apollo, or Gould machines).
The number of possible users of the book would prob-
ably have been significantly larger if Prolog had been
the main programming formalism used.
Because of the various degrees to which mathemat-
ical and programming formalisms are mastered by stu-
dents of linguistics, one cannot give a definite answer as
to the best textbook on CL to be used. These differ-
ences in the depth of penetration in each other&apos;s field
are a natural consequence of the interdisciplinary nature
of the subject.

When a book appears with a general title like Natural
Language Processing and the claim that it will be
&amp;quot;invaluable reading to undergraduates. . . as well as to
professionals specialising in this area,&amp;quot; anyone inter-
ested in natural language processing (hereafter NLP)
will probably want to know its contents. A book like
this represents, in a way, all of us working in the area
and presents the area to people seeking an introduction
to it.
Sadly, this is a disappointing book. The book&apos;s title,
the blurb on its back cover, and its introduction give a
misimpression of its actual contents. The book, it is
claimed, fills a gap: whereas other books on NLP &amp;quot;tend
. . . to be orientated towards research reports, reprint-
ing these without much analysis or comparison,&amp;quot; No-
ble&apos;s book, it is claimed, &amp;quot;describes different ap-
proaches as a coherent progression, characterised by
increasing complexity and richness of semantic descrip-
tion.&amp;quot;
However, there have been a series of books that
survey different approaches to semantic and syntactic
analysis in NLP, e.g., Tennant (1981), Winograd (1983),
Harris (1985), Grishman (1986), and Allen (1987); Barr
and Feigenbaum (1981) and Shapiro (1987) give shorter
overviews of NLP and related topics; Schank and
Riesbeck (1981) and Sowa (1984) offer particular views
of semantic description in NLP (Sowa&apos;s book also
provides an extensive review of NLP research); and
there are several edited collections of articles on NLP
(e.g., Lehnert and Ringle 1982; Grosz, Sparck Jones,
and Webber 1986). Of these, the bibliography of No-
ble&apos;s book lists only Winograd&apos;s, Harris&apos;s, and Schank
and Riesbeck&apos;s books (the most recent reference is
1985).
The blurb and introduction are correct in that, even
with the books mentioned above, a gap exists that needs
filling: there is relatively little critical analysis or com-
parison of research in NLP in semantics and pragmat-
ics. However, Noble&apos;s book does not fill this gap.
Instead, the book&apos;s three parts cover the following. Part
1 focuses on just one approach to syntactic analysis,
augmented transition networks (ATNs). Part 2 empha-
sizes basically just one approach to semantic descrip-
tion, Schank&apos;s Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory
and later work added to it. In Parts 1 and 2, program-
ming examples are given in the language POP-11, which
is described briefly in the one appendix. Part 3 discusses
some problems in semantics and NLP and ends with the
author&apos;s personal view of NLP.
If Noble&apos;s book offered a comprehensive and original
critical analysis of the syntactic and semantic ap-
proaches and an interesting, unusual view of NLP then
the book&apos;s title and claims might be overlooked, but it
does not offer such an analysis or view. And unfortu-
nately what is presented is marred by vague or unac-
knowledged references to other people&apos;s ideas and
systems, unsubstantiated claims, misapprehensions, er-
rors, and inconsistencies. Below is a sample of each.
Perhaps the book&apos;s main problem is that subject after
subject is introduced without citing any references. This
is unhelpful, especially in an introductory text. No
references appear in the descriptions of, for example,
time and tense (pp. 39-55), case grammar (pp. 106-
114—no mention of, e.g., Fillmore), frames including
frame inheritance and frame demons (pp. 115-121—no
reference to Minsky or others), and naive physics, &amp;quot;the
term used to describe everyday knowledge of the phys-
ical behaviour of the world&amp;quot; (p. 145— Hayes not cited).
A further example:
Another aspect of the microworld approach which
gives some disquiet is the tendency to define objects
in terms of their properties in a rather inflexible way.
A man does not cease to be a man if he loses his legs.
The identity of an entity is not simply a function of its
properties (p. 145).
No references are given, though Brachman (1985), for
example, discusses just this.
To give an example of an allusion made to a system:
Chapter 16 mentions &amp;quot;one well-known system which
used a &apos;blocks world&apos; &amp;quot; (p. 144) without ever saying in
the chapter that the system is Winograd&apos;s SHRDLU
program or referencing his (1972) book. The bibliogra-
phy, however, references Winograd&apos;s book (p. 221) and
mention is made of &amp;quot;Winograd&apos;s &apos;blocks world&apos; sys-
tem&amp;quot; allowing a novice reader to guess that the &amp;quot;well-
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 205

known system&amp;quot; mentioned back on page 144 was
Winograd&apos;s. Another example:
It may seem strange to include spatial relationships in
a list of outstanding problems, because there have
been a number of systems developed which appear to
solve this problem quite successfully (p. 149).
No references are given to any systems.
The following quotations give an idea of the unsub-
stantiated claims made in the book:
Alongside the flourishing exploitation of established
techniques, a fundamental rethink of the approach to
natural language processing is currently in progress
among research workers. It is recognised that in
order to progress we must backtrack to a more
elementary level, and develop a theory of semantic
representation which is not over simplified by being
restricted to a limited context or &apos;micro-world&apos; (p.
143).
This is a considerable claim, yet the book does not state
which researchers have been doing this rethinking and
developing this new theory of semantic representation.
The theory of conceptual dependencies has been
influential, and has been used as the foundation for a
number of interesting systems which have achieved a
limited measure of success. Although it has an ad hoc
flavour which is philosophically unsatisfactory, it
addresses questions of meaning and interpretation
which have been largely avoided by many other NL
systems (p. 126).
This quote begins Chapter 14 on &amp;quot;Conceptual Depen-
dencies.&amp;quot; The first reference to any people in CD
theory is made seven pages into the chapter. What
&amp;quot;interesting systems&amp;quot; are being referred to? No sys-
tems are mentioned in the chapter. Who has suggested
that CD theory has &amp;quot;an ad hoc flavour?&amp;quot; What &amp;quot;ques-
tions of meaning and interpretation&amp;quot; have been largely
avoided in other NL systems? We are never told.
The book also contains some misapprehensions. For
example, Chapter 12 on &amp;quot;Frame-Based Systems&amp;quot; says
that: &amp;quot;Special languages have been developed to facil-
itate the use of frames, of which the best known is FRL
(Frame Representation Language)&amp;quot; (p. 120).
Surely, KRL (e.g., Bobrow and Winograd 1977) and
KL-ONE (e.g., Brachman and Schmolze 1985) are
better known (incidentally, no references are cited for
FRL). Another misapprehension is that &amp;quot;the total vo-
cabulary of Basic English&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;about 600 words&amp;quot; (p.
216); its core vocabulary is 850 words (Richards 1943, p.
20f1).
On a more superficial level, though quite distracting
all the same, is the number of spelling and typographical
errors, missing or superfluous words, incorrect cita-
tions, and style inconsistencies.
In sum, a better title for the book might be, say,
&amp;quot;How to Implement Some Techniques from Natural
Language Processing in POP-11&amp;quot; because that is the
gap that the book fills in the NLP literature. However,
if beginners are looking for an introduction to NLP or
professionals are looking for an overview of the area,
they might well consider looking to Grishman (1986),
Allen (1987) or Shapiro (1987).

What &amp;quot;interesting systems&amp;quot; are being referred to? No systems are mentioned in the chapter. Who has suggested that CD theory has &amp;quot;an ad hoc flavour?&amp;quot; What &amp;quot;questions of meaning and interpretation&amp;quot; have been largely avoided in other NL systems? We are never told. The book also contains some misapprehensions. For example, Chapter 12 on &amp;quot;Frame-Based Systems&amp;quot; says that: &amp;quot;Special languages have been developed to facilitate the use of frames, of which the best known is FRL (Frame Representation Language)&amp;quot; (p. 120). Surely, KRL (e.g., Bobrow and Winograd 1977) and KL-ONE (e.g., Brachman and Schmolze 1985) are better known (incidentally, no references are cited for FRL). Another misapprehension is that &amp;quot;the total vocabulary of Basic English&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;about 600 words&amp;quot; (p. 216); its core vocabulary is 850 words (Richards 1943, p. 20f1). On a more superficial level, though quite distracting all the same, is the number of spelling and typographical errors, missing or superfluous words, incorrect citations, and style inconsistencies. In sum, a better title for the book might be, say, &amp;quot;How to Implement Some Techniques from Natural Language Processing in POP-11&amp;quot; because that is the gap that the book fills </context>
