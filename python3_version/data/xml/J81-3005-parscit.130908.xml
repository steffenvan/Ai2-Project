The computational linguist who manages to worm
his way through this volume should come away im-
pressed, at the very least, by the size of the linguistic
universe that has not yet been explored by Turing
machines. That universe includes the chief themes of
this book: the phenomena of language contact and
change, of language planning, of multilingualism and
code-switching, of pidgin/creole continua, of social
variation—in short, all the phenomena that have been
treated in the past 10-15 years under the rubric of
sociolinguistics.
West of the New Guinea mainland itself, east of
the Solomon Islands, and south through the New He-
brides stretches the territory known as the New Guin-
ea area. Over 1000 separate or separable languages
are spoken here, making it the most diversified linguis-
tic region, for its size, in the world. Research in the
area, as presented in this book, has taken three tracks:
grouping and categorizing (genetic and geographical
relationships); reporting on events of sociolinguistic
concern (grouped roughly under &amp;quot;Ethnography of
Speaking&amp;quot;); and more detailed investigation into one
major sociolinguistic phenomenon, the advent and
development of pidgins and creoles.
Most of the papers presented here are long on doc-
umentation and short on programming: that is, they
can be scanned for research ideas but not translated
easily into computational terms. Warm notice should
be taken of the possible exceptions to this generaliza-
tion: for example, Mike Olsen&apos;s work on the social
significance of possessive markers in the Barai lan-
guage presents three morphological systems and their
set-theoretical interpretation in a fashion that would
lend itself interestingly to computer grammar construc-
tion. Other papers that might stimulate research ideas
include Graham Scott on lexical expansion in the Fore
language (for those interested in learning, here is a
description of how speakers expand their vocabulary
by (a) using the available vernacular and (b) borrow-
ing loanwords with attendant semantic and phonologi-
cal shifts) and the papers by Johnston, Muhlhauser,
and Wurm and Muhlhauser on stylistic and dialectal
comparison (for those interested in language genera-
tion).
Readers of this collection will probably wish that
the editor had done a better mapping job in every
sense of the term—the book could have included more
geographical maps for the non-initiated, more precise
grammatical descriptions for the computationally-
minded, and a properly detailed index for everyone.
Much of the hesitation with which non-sociolinguists
will approach the book might have been dispelled by
taking this more scrupulous path.
The appearance in this AJCL issue of a paper by
Weber and Mann on &amp;quot;Prospects for Computer-
Assisted Dialect Adaptation&amp;quot; (pp. 165-177) may point
the way to a fresh consideration of the possibilities for
computational research in these fuzzier areas of lin-
guistic theory and action. At any rate, the Weber and
Mann paper is an early bird in the field, suggesting
interest in the book reviewed here, and partially de-
scribing a territory from which we have, one hopes,
not heard the last word.
