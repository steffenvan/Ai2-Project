Text mining is defined by Hearst (1999) as the automatic discovery of new, previously
unknown information from unstructured textual data. This is often seen as comprising
three major tasks: information retrieval (gathering relevant documents), information
extraction (extracting information of interest from these documents), and data mining
(discovering new associations among the extracted pieces of information).
Most researchers in the natural language processing (NLP) community are familiar
with work on information extraction and its subtasks such as noun phrase chunking,
named entity recognition, and anaphora resolution, typically applied to newswire arti-
cles. The explosive growth of biomedical literature has prompted increasing interest
in applying such techniques to biomedical text in order to address the information
overload faced by domain experts. This is reflected by the proliferation of articles
reviewing this work (Reviews 2006), which typically appear in bioinformatics journals
and target experts in biosciences as their primary audience.
Text Mining for Biology and Biomedicine provides an overview of the fundamental
approaches to biomedical NLP in more depth than is typically offered in a review article.
The book consists of an introductory chapter written by the editors and nine chapters
that each discuss a different sub-area of biomedical NLP. Each chapter is authored by
researcher(s) with significant contributions to the overviewed sub-area.
In the introductory chapter, Sophia Ananiadou and John McNaught adhere to the
definition of text mining by Hearst (p. 1), although their interpretation lays more em-
phasis on the unstructured nature of the input textual data than on the potential novelty
of the output information. Those “interested in organizing, searching, discovering, or
communicating biological knowledge” (p. 2) are the targeted readers of the book. The
book aims to provide them with an “extensive summarization and discussion of the
research literature in text mining and reported systems, geared towards informing and
educating rather than oriented towards other text mining experts” (p. 3). Information
retrieval is placed outside the scope of the book, which focuses on performing fa-
miliar tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) and information extraction (IE)
on biomedical text, but also extensively discusses problems that are less studied in
general NLP but are of particular importance in this area, such as the exploitation of
domain-specific knowledge sources, the construction of terminologies, how to deal with
abbreviations, and so on. An outline of the main aims and challenges in biomedical NLP
is followed by an overview of how these issues are discussed in each chapter.
Chapter 2, “Levels of natural language processing for text mining” by Udo Hahn
and Joachim Wermter, first explains how each level of linguistic analysis (i.e., mor-
phology, syntax, and semantics) is associated with distinct NLP components. Then a
Computational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 1
reference architecture for text mining that combines these components with each other
and with domain resources is presented and compared with the organization of two
extant systems, GeneWays (Rzhetsky et al. 2004) and PASTA (Gaizauskas et al. 2003).
The comparison leads to the conclusion that the reference architecture represents a
somewhat “idealized view of system building ... which has to be supplemented by
many heuristic solutions” (p. 37), which might explain why this architecture is not re-
ferred to extensively in subsequent chapters. The archetypal text-mining system should
ideally strive to produce “some form of proposition” (p. 33) as its output, which will be
subject to subsequent processing, for example, to discover new knowledge. However,
the authors acknowledge that they are not aware of any system with such an advanced
reasoning functionality (p. 34). I did not spot such a system being reviewed anywhere
else in the book so I may rather safely claim that the book is mainly about conduct-
ing NLP in the biomedical domain rather than discussing the text mining process
as a whole.
This chapter is meant to serve as “an introduction to the general techniques of
NLP ... necessary to fully appreciate discussions in following chapters” (p. 7). The
authors cite and discuss the seminal literature for each NLP component in their hypo-
thetical architecture quite comprehensively, although they do not include any references
to other introductory readings to NLP. These could have been helpful, because one
often comes across terminology that might be unknown to the non-specialist (e.g.,
Section 2.3.1 on part-of-speech tagging contains terms such as seed tagging, second order
n-gram Markov models, probabilistic suffix analysis, and smoothing by linear interpolation
without explanation). Quite a bit of jargon is used in other chapters as well, so my
feeling is that the book will be more accessible to readers with some familiarity with
NLP than to the non-initiated.
Chapter 3, “Lexical, terminological, and ontological resources for biological text
mining” by Olivier Bodenreider, discusses how the major publicly available knowledge
sources may support biomedical NER and IE, with particular emphasis on the three
components of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), namely, the Specialist
Lexicon, the Metathesaurus, and the Semantic Network (Bodenreider 2004). The chapter
exemplifies the utility that these resources may provide, although Bodenreider also
points out that they might often need to be extended or re-engineered to better serve
NER and IE. This is one of the main insights of the book that will be repeated in
subsequent chapters.
This chapter provides a clear discussion of the commonalities, differences, and
complementarity of the existing resources, which are classified into three types: lexical,
terminological, and ontological. Not distinguishing between the three types of resources
has been claimed earlier in the book to be likely to “lead to confusion and hamper
attempts at exploitation for text mining” (p. 7) although, in Bodenreider’s own words,
this distinction often ends up being “somewhat arbitrary” (p. 55). Hence he appears
to concentrate more on some of the limitations of the resources, such as the restricted
coverage of the genomic and the molecular biology subdomain. An overview of sug-
gested solutions to this problem is provided, although these seem to be more applicable
to domain-specific resources (e.g., model organism databases) than to the more general
UMLS resources that the chapter focuses on. It has also been argued earlier that the lack
of an explicit link between a lemma in the Specialist Lexicon and the corresponding
concept in the Metathesaurus might also limit their utility for NER and IE (p. 27), but
this issue remains unaddressed in Chapter 3.
Chapter 4, “Automatic terminology management in biomedicine” by Sophia
Ananiadou and Goran Nenadic, focuses on automatic term recognition (ATR) and

automatic term structuring (ATS). ATR identifies lexical units that correspond to do-
main concepts, and ATS organizes the recognized terms into knowledge structures
(terminologies). A brief introduction to terminology construction is followed by a
presentation of terminological resources in biomedicine (somewhat overlapping with
material in the previous chapter). A detailed review of the main approaches to ATM
and ATS constitutes the core of the chapter. Equally interesting is the discussion of the
challenges posed to ATR by the pervasive phenomena of term variation and ambiguity.
The chapter concludes with an overview of the ATRACT system (Mima, Ananiadou,
and Nenadic 2001), a terminology management workbench incorporating modules for
ATR and ATS. There is much valuable material in this chapter, although I felt that it
would have been more appropriate to discuss the difference between ATR and NER
here rather than having to wait until Chapter 6 (or go back to page 8). Some discussion
of the differences between ATS and IE (overviewed in Chapter 7) would have been
useful as well.
Chapter 5, “Abbreviations in biomedical text” by Jeff Chang and Hinrich Sch¨utze,
deals with the problem of linking an abbreviation to its expanded form(s). This is
important because of the very frequent use of abbreviations in the biomedical genre and
the continuous introduction of many new abbreviations. An introductory discussion of
the problems of defining and identifying abbreviations is followed by a detailed review
of the methods used to construct and evaluate the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation
Database (Chang, Sch¨utze, and Altman 2002). Different types of abbreviation variations
(already introduced in the previous chapter, although no cross-reference is provided)
and the methods used for their normalization are also overviewed. The chapter also
touches upon the problem of identifying long forms that do not appear in the same
document as the abbreviation. Several directions for future work are proposed, the
most interesting of which, in my view, are the need for a comprehensive study to
compare the coverage and accuracy of different abbreviation databases and the more ex-
tended investigation of algorithms that can automatically generate abbreviations from
long forms.
Chapter 6, “Named entity recognition” by Jong Park and Jung-jae Kim, concentrates
on applying NER to biomedical text. The nature of candidate named entities (NEs)
and issues related to their ambiguity, variation, and growth rate (also mentioned in
previous chapters) are discussed in detail to exemplify how biomedical NER differs
from traditional NER in the newswire domain. The main approaches to biomedical
NER are reviewed in depth with particular emphasis on the reported evaluation results
(although the authors also point out that these cannot always be used to directly
compare the approaches because of important methodological differences between the
evaluation studies). Grounding the recognized NEs in an ontology and dealing with
NEs other than gene and protein names are identified as the main challenges to address
in forthcoming research.
Chapters 4 through 6 clearly complement one another, although identifying over-
lapping or related sections often requires some effort on behalf of the reader. In par-
ticular, I often found it hard to keep track of literature reviewed in different chapters.
Each chapter contains its own list of references (enumerated in the order in which they
appear in the text, which seems to be the norm in biomedical publications). The number
in the list is typically used to point to a reference in the text. For instance, the ABGENE
system (Tanabe and Wilbur 2002) is reviewed both in Chapter 4 (p. 77) and in Chapter 6
(p. 134). In Chapter 4 the system is mentioned by name followed by its citation number
(i.e., “ABGENE [36]”), whereas in Chapter 6 the authors’ names appear together with
the citation number (i.e., “Tanabe and Wilbur [26]”). (Note that the term ABGENE is not

included in the book’s index.) Had the book come with a single reference section and
a citation index, the reader’s attempt to identify and extract related information would
have been facilitated greatly.
Chapter 7, “Information extraction” by John McNaught and William Black, is
devoted to rule-based methods for the extraction of simple facts and more complex
events. An overview of IE as shaped by the MUC evaluation efforts is followed by
a comprehensive critical assessment of the various approaches adopted for IE in the
biomedical domain. Sublanguage-driven systems that simultaneously consider syntax
and semantics, such as GENIES (Friedman et al. 2001), and systems that take advantage
of ontological information (Gaizauskas et al. 2003; Cimiano, Saric, and Reyle 2005) are
proclaimed to be the most successful. As in Chapter 2, being able to deliver abstract
representations of facts and events that can be subjected to subsequent data mining
or integrated in a knowledge base to enable reasoning (instead of simply returning
textual strings or their transforms) is regarded as a bonus for a system. Given that these
representations are likely to be heavily reliant on the requirements of the mining or rea-
soning process, I would welcome more discussion on how systems developed to deliver
material suitable for different knowledge bases may be compared with each other.
Chapter 7 concludes with a call for further efforts to produce resources that can be
used to train and evaluate more advanced IE systems, echoing other similar statements
throughout the book (most notably in Chapters 2 and 3). Given that the preparation
of such resources is not a trivial task (as discussed in the following chapter), it is
somehow surprising that semi-supervised or unsupervised machine learning methods,
for example those discussed by McCallum (2005), are not mentioned as an alternative
research avenue. The problem of resolving anaphoric references is mentioned in sev-
eral chapters as another essential NLP task that awaits in-depth investigation in the
biomedical domain. Chapter 7 is meant to provide an overview of existing approaches
to anaphora resolution in biomedical text (p. 148), but this takes place only in passing.
Devoting some more space to this issue would have been worthwhile as well.
Chapter 8, “Corpora and their annotation” by Jin-Dong Kim and Jun’ichi Tsujii,
discusses issues related to the collection and annotation of corpora. From their own ex-
perience in the development of the GENIA corpus (Kim et al. 2003), the authors provide
practical advice on how to compile a representative corpus, prepare annotation schemes
and guidelines, perform the actual annotation and, ultimately, assess the reliability of
the produced data. There is a section on annotation format that lays emphasis on XML-
based schemes but does not mention the B-I-O notation that is used in Chapters 2 and 4.
An informative discussion on available annotation tools concludes the chapter, which
is written very clearly, although I found some material too low level (particularly the
script to retrieve MEDLINE abstracts in Figure 8.1) or even subpar (Section 8.3.3 on the
comparison of corpora).
Chapter 9, “Evaluation of text mining in biology” by Lynette Hirschman and
Christian Blaschke, begins by explaining how the MUC and TREC evaluation challenges
and similar efforts in molecular biology inspired community attempts to build shared
assessment resources and agree on evaluation methodologies to appraise the state
of the art in biomedical NLP. The authors address the key issues of why, how, and
what to evaluate and then detail the design, organization, and main results of four
recent evaluation challenges and how these should motivate additional efforts in the
years to come.
One of the main points in Chapter 9 is that research on biomedical NLP should be
focused on resolving problems of practical relevance to biologists in order for them to
become involved in the development effort and continue to participate in challenging

evaluations. This issue is of particular interest to me because of my current involvement
in a project aiming to integrate an NLP system into an existing curation workflow (Kara-
manis et al. 2007). In Section 9.3.1, the authors distinguish between the tasks performed
by different types of users, namely database curators and research scientists, and then
go on to explain how different evaluation tasks were designed with a different type of
user in mind. Meeting users’ requirements seems to be relevant to other chapters of the
book as well. For instance, it is not clear whether delivering abstract representations of
facts (as suggested in Chapters 2 and 7) will assist curators more than pointing them to
actual textual strings. Developing and evaluating integrated systems that address the
users’ real-world needs is one of the greatest challenges in biomedical NLP (Cohen and
Hersh 2005), but is not substantially covered in the book.
Chapter 10, “Integrating text mining with data mining” by See-Kiong Ng, demon-
strates how certain NLP techniques may be incorporated into extant algorithms for
analyzing nontext biological data such as genomic sequences and expression profiles.
Many of the overviewed techniques have been shown to improve solutions to problems
that are of particular importance to research scientists, such as homology search and
sequence-based functional classification. This is a very interesting chapter, which comes
closer to the Hearstian notion of text mining than previous chapters, although most of
the reviewed techniques treat the text as a bag of words, thus deviating significantly
from the NLP technology discussed previously.
In conclusion, I believe that each chapter successfully combines a comprehensive
summary of the fundamental approaches with the authors’ precious insights. The book
is recommended to anyone interested in a more detailed overview of biomedical NLP
than what is typically presented in a review article although, unavoidably, the most
recent of these reviews may include more up-to-date information. Readers with some
NLP background will probably find the book more easily accessible than biomedical
scientists and might benefit even more from it if they apply some additional effort to
synthesize opinions across chapters. This review partially reflects my attempt to do that,
indicating a few ways in which I think that the book could be further enhanced. In any
case, the book will almost certainly fertilize ongoing research in the rapidly expanding
area of biomedical NLP, so I felt that studying it was time well spent.

Then a Computational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 1 reference architecture for text mining that combines these components with each other and with domain resources is presented and compared with the organization of two extant systems, GeneWays (Rzhetsky et al. 2004) and PASTA (Gaizauskas et al. 2003). The comparison leads to the conclusion that the reference architecture represents a somewhat “idealized view of system building ... which has to be supplemented by many heuristic solutions” (p. 37), which might explain why this architecture is not referred to extensively in subsequent chapters. The archetypal text-mining system should ideally strive to produce “some form of proposition” (p. 33) as its output, which will be subject to subsequent processing, for example, to discover new knowledge.

One of the main points in Chapter 9 is that research on biomedical NLP should be focused on resolving problems of practical relevance to biologists in order for them to become involved in the development effort and continue to participate in challenging 138 Book Reviews evaluations. This issue is of particular interest to me because of my current involvement in a project aiming to integrate an NLP system into an existing curation workflow (Karamanis et al. 2007). In Section 9.3.1, the authors distinguish between the tasks performed by different types of users, namely database curators and research scientists, and then go on to explain how different evaluation tasks were designed with a different type of user in mind. Meeting users’ requirements seems to be relevant to other chapters of the book as well. For instance, it is not clear whether delivering abstract representations of facts (as suggested in Chapters 2 and 7) will assist curators more than pointing them to actual textual strings.

Chapter 8, “Corpora and their annotation” by Jin-Dong Kim and Jun’ichi Tsujii, discusses issues related to the collection and annotation of corpora. From their own experience in the development of the GENIA corpus (Kim et al. 2003), the authors provide practical advice on how to compile a representative corpus, prepare annotation schemes and guidelines, perform the actual annotation and, ultimately, assess the reliability of the produced data. There is a section on annotation format that lays emphasis on XMLbased schemes but does not mention the B-I-O notation that is used in Chapters 2 and 4. An informative discussion on available annotation tools concludes the chapter, which is written very clearly, although I found some material too low level (particularly the script to retrieve MEDLINE abstracts in Figure 8.1) or ev</context>

Chapter 7 concludes with a call for further efforts to produce resources that can be used to train and evaluate more advanced IE systems, echoing other similar statements throughout the book (most notably in Chapters 2 and 3). Given that the preparation of such resources is not a trivial task (as discussed in the following chapter), it is somehow surprising that semi-supervised or unsupervised machine learning methods, for example those discussed by McCallum (2005), are not mentioned as an alternative research avenue. The problem of resolving anaphoric references is mentioned in several chapters as another essential NLP task that awaits in-depth investigation in the biomedical domain.

Most researchers in the natural language processing (NLP) community are familiar with work on information extraction and its subtasks such as noun phrase chunking, named entity recognition, and anaphora resolution, typically applied to newswire articles. The explosive growth of biomedical literature has prompted increasing interest in applying such techniques to biomedical text in order to address the information overload faced by domain experts. This is reflected by the proliferation of articles reviewing this work (Reviews 2006), which typically appear in bioinformatics journals and target experts in biosciences as their primary audience. Text Mining for Biology and Biomedicine provides an overview of the fundamental approaches to biomedical NLP in more depth than is typically offered in a review article. The book consists of an introductory chapter written by the editors and nine chapters that each discuss a different sub-area of biomedical NLP. Each chapter is authored by researcher(s) with significant contributions to the overviewed sub-area. In the introductory chapter, Sophia Ananiadou and John McNaught adhere t</context>

Chapters 4 through 6 clearly complement one another, although identifying overlapping or related sections often requires some effort on behalf of the reader. In particular, I often found it hard to keep track of literature reviewed in different chapters. Each chapter contains its own list of references (enumerated in the order in which they appear in the text, which seems to be the norm in biomedical publications). The number in the list is typically used to point to a reference in the text. For instance, the ABGENE system (Tanabe and Wilbur 2002) is reviewed both in Chapter 4 (p. 77) and in Chapter 6 (p. 134). In Chapter 4 the system is mentioned by name followed by its citation number (i.e., “ABGENE [36]”), whereas in Chapter 6 the authors’ names appear together with the citation number (i.e., “Tanabe and Wilbur [26]”). (Note that the term ABGENE is not 137 Computational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 1 included in the book’s index.)
