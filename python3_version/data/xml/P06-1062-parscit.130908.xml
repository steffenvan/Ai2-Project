This paper presents a new web mining
scheme for parallel data acquisition.
Based on the Document Object Model
(DOM), a web page is represented as a
DOM tree. Then a DOM tree alignment
model is proposed to identify the transla-
tionally equivalent texts and hyperlinks
between two parallel DOM trees. By
tracing the identified parallel hyperlinks,
parallel web documents are recursively
mined. Compared with previous mining
schemes, the benchmarks show that this
new mining scheme improves the mining
coverage, reduces mining bandwidth, and
enhances the quality of mined parallel
sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.999440055555556">
Parallel bilingual corpora are critical resources
for statistical machine translation (Brown 1993),
and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nie
1999). Additionally, parallel corpora have been
exploited for various monolingual natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) tasks, such as word-
sense disambiguation (Ng 2003) and paraphrase
acquisition (Callison 2005).
However, large scale parallel corpora are not
readily available for most language pairs. Even
where resources are available, such as for Eng-
lish-French, the data are usually restricted to
government documents (e.g., the Hansard corpus,
which consists of French-English translations of
debates in the Canadian parliament) or newswire
texts. The &amp;quot;governmentese&amp;quot; that characterizes
these document collections cannot be used on its
own to train data-driven machine translation sys-
tems for a range of domains and language pairs.
With a sharply increasing number of bilingual
web sites, web mining for parallel data becomes
a promising solution to this knowledge acquisi-
tion problem. In an effort to estimate the amount
of bilingual data on the web, (Ma and Liberman
1999) surveyed web pages in the de (German
web site) domain, showing that of 150,000 web-
sites in the .de domain, 10% are German-English
bilingual. Based on such observations, some web
mining systems have been developed to auto-
matically obtain parallel corpora from the web
(Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen,
Chau and Yeh 2004; Resnik and Smith 2003
Zhang et al 2006 ). These systems mine parallel
web documents within bilingual web sites, ex-
ploiting the fact that URLs of many parallel web
pages are named with apparent patterns to facili-
tate website maintenance. Hence given a bilin-
gual website, the mining systems use pre-defined
URL patterns to discover candidate parallel
documents within the site. Then content-based
features will be used to verify the translational
equivalence of the candidate pairs.
However, due to the diversity of web page
styles and website maintenance mechanisms,
bilingual websites use varied naming schemes
for parallel documents. For example, the United
Nation’s website, which contains thousands of
parallel pages, simply names the majority of its
web pages with some computer generated ad-hoc
URLs. Such a website then cannot be mined by
the URL pattern-based mining scheme. To fur-
ther improve the coverage of web mining, other
patterns associated with translational parallelism
are called for.
Besides, URL pattern-based mining may raise
concerns on high bandwidth cost and slow
download speed. Based on descriptions of (Nie et
al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau
and Yeh 2004), the mining process requires a full
host crawling to collect URLs before using URL
patterns to discover the parallel documents.
Since in many bilingual web sites, parallel
documents are much sparser than comparable
documents, a significant portion of internet
bandwidth is wasted on downloading web pages
without translational counterparts.
Furthermore, there is a lack of discussion on
the quality of mined data. To support machine
translation, parallel sentences should be extracted
from the mined parallel documents. However,
current sentence alignment models, (Brown et al
1991; Gale &amp; Church 1991; Wu 1994; Chen

1993; Zhao and Vogel, 2002; etc.) are targeted
on traditional textual documents. Due to the
noisy nature of the web documents, parallel web
pages may consist of non-translational content
and many out-of-vocabulary words, both of
which reduce sentence alignment accuracy. To
improve sentence alignment performance on the
web data, the similarity of the HTML tag struc-
tures between the parallel web documents should
be leveraged properly in the sentence alignment
model.
In order to improve the quality of mined data
and increase the mining coverage and speed, this
paper proposes a new web parallel data mining
scheme. Given a pair of parallel web pages as
seeds, the Document Object Model1 (DOM) is
used to represent the web pages as a pair of
DOM trees. Then a stochastic DOM tree align-
ment model is used to align translationally
equivalent content, including both textual chunks
and hyperlinks, between the DOM tree pairs. The
parallel hyperlinks discovered are regarded as
anchors to new parallel data. This makes the
mining scheme an iterative process.
The new mining scheme has three advantages:
(i) Mining coverage is increased. Parallel hyper-
links referring to parallel web page is a general
and reliable pattern for parallel data mining.
Many bilingual websites not supporting URL
pattern-based mining scheme support this new
mining scheme. Our mining experiment shows
that, using the new web mining scheme, the web
mining throughput is increased by 32%; (ii) The
quality of the mined data is improved. By lever-
aging the web pages’ HTML structures, the sen-
tence aligner supported by the DOM tree align-
ment model outperforms conventional ones by
7% in both precision and recall; (iii) The band-
width cost is reduced by restricting web page
downloads to the links that are very likely to be
parallel.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
In the next section, we introduce the related work.
In Section 3, a new web parallel data mining
scheme is presented. Three component technolo-
gies, the DOM tree alignment model, the sen-
tence aligner, and the candidate parallel page
verification model are presented in Section 4, 5,
and 6. Section 7 presents experiments and
benchmarks. The paper is finally concluded in
Section 8.

The parallel data available on the web have been
an important knowledge source for machine
translation. For example, Hong Kong Laws, an
English-Chinese Parallel corpus released by Lin-
guistic Data Consortium (LDC) is downloaded
from the Department of Justice of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region website.
Recently, web mining systems have been built
to automatically acquire parallel data from the
web. Exemplary systems include PTMiner (Nie
et al 1999), STRAND (Resnik and Smith, 2003),
BITS (Ma and Liberman, 1999), and PTI (Chen,
Chau and Yeh, 2004). Given a bilingual website,
these systems identify candidate parallel docu-
ments using pre-defined URL patterns. Then
content-based features are employed for candi-
date verification. Particularly, HTML tag simi-
larities have been exploited to verify parallelism
between pages. But it is done by simplifying
HTML tags as a string sequence instead of a hi-
erarchical DOM tree. Tens of thousands parallel
documents have been acquired with accuracy
over 90%.
To support machine translation, parallel sen-
tence pairs should be extracted from the parallel
web documents. A number of techniques for
aligning sentences in parallel corpora have been
proposed. (Gale &amp; Church 1991; Brown et al.
1991; Wu 1994) used sentence length as the ba-
sic feature for alignment. (Kay &amp; Roscheisen
1993; and Chen 1993) used lexical information
for sentence alignment. Models combining
length and lexicon information were proposed in
(Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Moore 2002). Signal
processing techniques is also employed in sen-
tence alignment by (Church 1993; Fung &amp;
McKeown 1994). Recently, much research atten-
tion has been paid to aligning sentences in com-
parable documents (Utiyama et al 2003,
Munteanu et al 2004).
The DOM tree alignment model is the key
technique of our mining approach. Although, to
our knowledge, this is the first work discussing
DOM tree alignments, there is substantial re-
search focusing on syntactic tree alignment
model for machine translation. For example, (Wu
1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas, 2000;
Yamada and Knight, 2001) have studied syn-
chronous context free grammar. This formalism
requires isomorphic syntax trees for the source
sentence and its translation. (Shieber and Scha-
bes 1990) presents a synchronous tree adjoining
grammar (STAG) which is able to align two syn-

tactic trees at the linguistic minimal units. The
synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG)
presented in (Hajic etc. 2004) is a simplified ver-
sion of STAG which allows tree substitution op-
eration, but prohibits the operation of tree ad-
junction.

and then goes to Step 2 for parallelism veri-
fication. If no more parallel hyperlinks are
found, stop the mining process.
Our new mining scheme is iterative in nature.
It fully exploits the information contained in the
parallel data and effectively uses it to pinpoint
the location holding more parallel data. This ap-
proach is based on our observation that parallel
pages share similar structures holding parallel
content, and parallel hyperlinks refer to new par-
allel pages.
By exploiting both the HTML tag similarity
and the content-based translational equivalences,
the DOM tree alignment model extracts parallel
text chunks. Working on the parallel text chunks
instead of the text of the whole web page, the
sentence alignment accuracy can be improved by
a large margin.
In the next three sections, three component
techniques, the DOM tree alignment model, sen-
tence alignment model, and candidate web page
pair verification model are introduced.

4 DOM Tree Alignment Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984734125">
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an appli-
cation programming interface for valid HTML
documents. Using DOM, the logical structure of
a HTML document is represented as a tree where
each node belongs to some pre-defined node
types (e.g. Document, DocumentType, Element,
Text, Comment, ProcessingInstruction etc.).
Among all these types of nodes, the nodes most
relevant to our purpose are Element nodes (cor-
responding to the HTML tags) and Text nodes
(corresponding to the texts). To simplify the de-
scription of the alignment model, minor modifi-
cations of the standard DOM tree are made: (i)
Only the Element nodes and Text nodes are kept
in our document tree model. (ii) The ALT attrib-
ute is represented as Text node in our document
tree model. The ALT text are textual alternative
when images cannot be displayed, hence is help-
ful to align images and hyperlinks. (iii) the Text
node (which must be a leaf) and its parent Ele-
ment node are combined into one node in order
to concise the representation of the alignment
model. The above three modifications are exem-
plified in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1 Difference between Standard DOM and
Our Document Tree
Despite these minor differences, our document
tree is still referred as DOM tree throughout this
paper.
(1) Given a web site, the root page and web
pages directly linked from the root page are
downloaded. Then for each of the
downloaded web page, all of its anchor texts
(i.e. the hyperlinked words on a web page)
are compared with a list of predefined strings
known to reflect translational equivalence
among web pages (Nie et al 1999). Exam-

4.1 DOM Tree Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988493928571429">
Similar to STSG, our DOM tree alignment model
supports node deletion, insertion and substitution.
Besides, both STSG and our DOM tree align-
ment model define the alignment as a tree hierar-
chical invariance process, i.e. if node A is aligned
with node B, then the children of A are either
deleted or aligned with the children of B.
But two major differences exist between
STSG and our DOM tree alignment model: (i)
Our DOM tree alignment model requires the
alignment a sequential order invariant process,
i.e. if node A is aligned with node B, then the
sibling nodes following A have to be either de-
leted or aligned with the sibling nodes following
B. (ii) (Hajic etc. 2004) presents STSG in the
context of language generation, while we search
for the best alignment on the condition that both
trees are given.

ment model, the following symbols are intro-
duced: given a HTML document D, D

The HTML tag similarity feature is computed
as follows: all of the HTML tags of a given web
page are extracted, and concatenated as a string.
Then, a minimum edit distance between the two
tag strings associated with the candidate pair is
computed, and the HMTL tag similarity score is
defined as the ratio of match operation number to
the total operation number.
The sentence alignment score is defined as the
ratio of the number of aligned sentences and the
total number of sentences in both files.
Using these three features, the maximum en-
tropy model is trained on 1,000 pairs of web
pages manually labeled as parallel or non-
parallel. The Iterative Scaling algorithm (Pietra,
Pietra and Lafferty 1995) is used for the training.

7 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920857142857">
The DOM tree alignment based mining system is
used to acquire English-Chinese parallel data
from the web. The mining procedure is initiated
by acquiring Chinese website list.
We have downloaded about 300,000 URLs of
Chinese websites from the web directories at
cn.yahoo.com, hk.yahoo.com and tw.yahoo.com.
And each website is sent to the mining system
for English-Chinese parallel data acquisition. To
ensure that the whole mining experiment to be
finished in schedule, we stipulate that it takes at
most 10 hours on mining each website. Totally
11,000 English-Chinese websites are discovered,
from which 63,214 pairs of English-Chinese par-
allel web documents are mined. After sentence
alignment, totally 1,069,423 pairs of English-
Chinese parallel sentences are extracted.
In order to compare the system performance,
100 English-Chinese bilingual websites are also
mined using the URL pattern based mining
scheme. Following (Nie et al 1999; Ma and
Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004), the
URL pattern-based mining consists of three steps:
(i) host crawling for URL collection; (ii) candi-
date pair identification by pre-defined URL pat-
tern matching; (iii) candidate pair verification.
Based on these mining results, the quality of
the mined data, the mining coverage and mining
efficiency are measured.
First, we benchmarked the precision of the
mined parallel documents. 3,000 pairs of Eng-
lish-Chinese candidate documents are randomly
selected from the output of each mining system,
and are reviewed by human annotators. The
document level precision is shown in Table 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999866238095238">
The document-level mining precision solely
depends on the candidate document pair verifica-
tion module. The verification modules of both
mining systems use the same features, and the
only difference is that in the new mining system
the sentence alignment score is computed with
DOM tree alignment support. So the 3.7% im-
provement in document-level precision indirectly
confirms the enhancement of sentence alignment.
Secondly, the accuracy of sentence alignment
model is benchmarked as follows: 150 English-
Chinese parallel document pairs are randomly
taken from our mining results. All parallel sen-
tence pairs in these document pairs are manually
annotated by two annotators with cross-
validation. We have compared sentence align-
ment accuracy with and without DOM tree
alignment support. In case of no tree alignment
support, all the texts in the web pages are ex-
tracted and sent to sentence aligner for alignment.
The benchmarks are shown in Table 2.

Table 2 shows that with DOM tree alignment
support, the sentence alignment accuracy is
greatly improved by 7% in both precision and
recall. We also observed that the recall is lower
than precision. This is because web pages tend to
contain many short sentences (one or two words
only) whose alignment is hard to identify due to
the lack of content information.
Although Table 2 benchmarks the accuracy of
sentence aligner, but the quality of the final sen-
tence pair outputs depend on many other mod-
ules as well, e.g. the document level parallelism
verification, sentence breaker, Chinese word
breaker, etc. To further measure the quality of
the mined data, 2,000 sentence pairs are ran-
domly picked from the final output, and are
manually classified into three categories: (i) ex-
act parallel, (ii) roughly parallel: two parallel
sentences involving missing words or erroneous
additions; (iii) not parallel. Two annotators are

a bilingual website. Instead, we compare mining
coverage and efficiency between the two systems.

by both of the system. And the mining efficiency
comparison is reported in Table 4.

Although it downloads less data, the DOM
tree based mining scheme increases the parallel
data acquisition throughput by 32%. Furthermore,
the ratio of downloaded page count per parallel
pair is 2.26, which means the bandwidth usage is
almost optimal.
Another interesting topic is the complemen-
tarities between both mining systems. As re-
ported in Table (5), 1797 pairs of parallel docu-
ments mined by the new scheme is not covered
by the URL pattern-based scheme. So if both
systems are used, the throughput can be further
increased by 41%.

8 Discussion and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999263">
Mining parallel data from web is a promising
method to overcome the knowledge bottleneck
faced by machine translation. To build a practical
mining system, three research issues should be
fully studied: (i) the quality of mined data, (ii)
the mining coverage, and (iii) the mining speed.
Exploiting DOM tree similarities helps in all the
three issues.
Motivated by this observation, this paper pre-
sents a new web mining scheme for parallel data
acquisition. A DOM tree alignment model is pro-
posed to identify translationally equivalent text
chunks and hyperlinks between two HTML
documents. Parallel hyperlinks are used to pin-
point new parallel data, and make parallel data
mining a recursive process. Parallel text chunks
are fed into sentence aligner to extract parallel
sentences.
Benchmarks show that sentence aligner sup-
ported by DOM tree alignment achieves per-
formance enhancement by 7% in both precision
and recall. Besides, the new mining scheme re-
duce the bandwidth cost by 8~9 times on average
compared with the URL pattern-based mining
scheme. In addition, the new mining scheme is
more general and reliable, and is able to mine
more data. Using the new mining scheme alone,
the mining throughput is increased by 32%, and
when combined with URL pattern-based scheme,
the mining throughput is increased by 41%.

Then a DOM tree alignment model is proposed to identify the translationally equivalent texts and hyperlinks between two parallel DOM trees. By tracing the identified parallel hyperlinks, parallel web documents are recursively mined.

For example, (Wu 1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas, 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001) have studied synchronous context free grammar. This formalism requires isomorphic syntax trees for the source sentence and its translation. (Shieber and Schabes 1990) presents a synchronous tree adjoining grammar (STAG) which is able to align two syn490 tactic trees at the linguistic minimal units. The synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) presented in (Hajic etc. 2004) is a simplified version of STAG which allows tree substitution operation, but prohibits the operation of tree adjunction. 3 A New Parallel Data Mining Scheme Supported by DOM Tree Alignment Our</context>

Since in many bilingual web sites, parallel documents are much sparser than comparable documents, a significant portion of internet bandwidth is wasted on downloading web pages without translational counterparts. Furthermore, there is a lack of discussion on the quality of mined data. To support machine translation, parallel sentences should be extracted from the mined parallel documents. However, current sentence alignment models, (Brown et al 1991; Gale &amp; Church 1991; Wu 1994; Chen 489 Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the ACL, pages 489–496, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics 1993; Zhao and Vogel, 2002; etc.) are targeted on traditional textual documents.

Conventional parallel data released by LDC are used to train IBM model I for estimating the text translation probability ( ) Pr t F t E . One way to estimate ( &apos; ) Pr l l and pd is to manually align nodes between parallel DOM trees, and use them as training corpora for maximum likelihood estimation.

In the decoding process, dynamic programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal tree alignment using that of the sub-trees in a bottom up manner.

With a sharply increasing number of bilingual web sites, web mining for parallel data becomes a promising solution to this knowledge acquisition problem.

Based on such observations, some web mining systems have been developed to automatically obtain parallel corpora from the web (Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004; Resnik and Smith 2003 Zhang et al 2006 ).

For example, the United Nation’s website, which contains thousands of parallel pages, simply names the majority of its web pages with some computer generated ad-hoc URLs. Such a website then cannot be mined by the URL pattern-based mining scheme. To further improve the coverage of web mining, other patterns associated with translational parallelism are called for. Besides, URL pattern-based mining may raise concerns on high bandwidth cost and slow download speed. Based on descriptions of (Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004), the mining process requires a full host crawling to collect URLs before using URL patterns to discover the parallel documents.

Pr r (T T[ ] A) F E , [ 1, ] , m n + i j ) P ( T T[ ] A ) Fm n , E [ , ] , i j Pr Pr r (N TC T T[ ] A) F F E . , m [1 , ] [ 1, ] , K m n + i j Pr d TiF .TC[ , Ki ] 493 The HTML tag similarity feature is computed as follows: all of the HTML tags of a given web page are extracted, and concatenated as a string. Then, a minimum edit distance between the two tag strings associated with the candidate pair is computed, and the HMTL tag similarity score is defined as the ratio of match operation</context>

With a sharply increasing number of bilingual web sites, web mining for parallel data becomes a promising solution to this knowledge acquisition problem. In an effort to estimate the amount of bilingual data on the web, (Ma and Liberman 1999) surveyed web pages in the de (German web site) domain, showing that of 150,000 websites in the .de domain, 10% are German-English bilingual. Based on such observations, some web mining systems have been developed to automatically obtain parallel corpora from the web (Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004; Resnik and Smith 2003 Zhang et al 2006 ). These systems mine parallel web documents within bilingual web sites, exploiting the fact that URLs of many parallel web pages are named with apparent patterns to facilitate website maintenance. Hence given a bilingual website, the mining systems use pre-defined URL patterns to discover candidate parallel documents within the site. Then content-based features will be used to verify the translational equivalence of the candidate pairs. However, due to the diversity of web page styles and website maintenance mechanisms, bilingual websites use varied naming schemes for parallel documents. For</context>
