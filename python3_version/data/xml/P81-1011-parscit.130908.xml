Is evaluation, like beauty, in the eye of the beholder?
The answer is far from simple because it depends on who
is considered to be the proper beholder. Evaluators may
range from casual users to society as a whole, with sys-
tem builders, sophisticated users, linguists, grant pro-
viders, system buyers, and others in between. The
members of this panel are system builders and linguists
-- or rather the two fused into one -- but, I believe,
interested in all or almost all actual or potential
bodies of evaluators. One of our colleagues expressed a
forceful opinion while being a member of a similar panel
at last year&apos;s ACL conference: &amp;quot;Those of us on this
panel and other researchers in the field simply don&apos;t
have the right to determine whether a system is practi-
cal. Only the users of such a system can make that
determination. Only a user can decide whether the NL
(natural language] capability constitutes sufficient
added value to be deemed practical Only a user can
decide if the system&apos;s frequency of inappropriate
response is sufficiently low to be deemed practical.
Only a user can decide whether the overall NL interac-
tion, taken in toto, offers enough benefits over alter-
native formal interactions to be deemed practical&amp;quot; M.
It is hard for me to disagree, since I argued as force-
fully on the basis of my study of users&apos; evaluation of
machine translation (21 -- a study which was prompted by
the evaluations of the quality of machine translation as
viewed by linguists and users, ranging from 35% accept-
able for the former to 90% for the latter. What the
study also showed was that the practicality of the out-
put could indeed only be judged by the users, since even
incomplete and stylistically very inelegant translations
were found quite useful in practice because they, on the
one hand, provided, however crudely, the information
sought by the users, and, on the other hand, the users
themselves brought knowledge that made the texts far
more understandable and useful than might appear to a
nonspecialist linguist. But this endorsement on my part
of the user as the ultimate judge in evaluations does
not preclude my fully subscribing to Norm Sondheimer&apos;s
(31 introductory comments to this panel stating that to
&amp;quot;make progress as a field, we need to be able to evalu-
ate.&amp;quot; We are now less likely to confuse the issue of the
evaluation by people like ourselves and the judgment of
the users, less likely to be surprised at the discrepan-
cies, and less likely to be surprised at the users&apos;
acceptance of the limitations of our NL interfaces.
Also, we are far more aware of the fact that evaluations
of &amp;quot;worth&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; have to be conducted in the con-
texts of the actual, perceived needs. In extensive stu-
dies on evaluation of innovations, Hosteller (41, the
recently retired president of AAAS, found that &amp;quot;success-
ful innovators better understand user needs; (and] pay
more attention to marketing. . . .&amp;quot; The same source,
however, leads me to the notorious difficulties of
evaluation given the wide range of evaluators and their
purposes. We are all undoubtedly convinced of the value
of ELI for the society as a whole, but the evaluation of
experiments with these interfaces is another matter.
Hosteller was faced with social, sociomedical, and medi-
cal fields. Let me recount some of the studies he and
his team made for reasons which will soon become obvi-
ous. His team scored a given program on a scale from
plus two to minus two with zero meaning there was essen-
tially no gain. Accordingly, a study of delinquent
girls that identified them but failed to prevent them
from delinquency received a zero. Likewise, a zero was
assigned to a probation experiment for conviction
for public drunkenness in which three methods were

used: (1) no treatment, (2) an alcoholic clinic, and
(3) Alcoholics Anonymous. Since the &amp;quot;no treatment&amp;quot;

group performed somewhat better, short-term referrals
were considered of no value. A minus one was given to a
study whose results were opposite to those hoped for: a
major insurance company increased outpatient benefits in
the hope of decreasing hospital costs, but the outpa-
tient group&apos;s hospital stays increased. Finally, a dou-
ble plus was awarded to an experiment involving the Salk
vaccine, which was, predictably, very successful. Now
this kind of evaluation may be justified when the needs
of the society are at stake. I have gone into these
details, however, for the purpose of expressing the
opinion, in which I know I&apos;m not alone, that negative
results are as important as positive ones, that evalua-
tion in our case is almost equivalent to the amount of
information obtained in an experiment. An experiment
whose results would be totally predictable would be
almost useless, but one with results different from
those hoped for might be embarrassing but very valuable.
Another comment prompted by those evaluations is that
the application of any rigid, fine scale is totally
inappropriate in the case of ML! evaluations.

A. METHODOLOGY AND SOME RESULTS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994775">
It had been widely taken for granted some time ago that
NLI is as good as is its grammar, and a grammar is as
good as it is extensive. The specific needs of users,
the requirements of special tasks and the like took a
back seat. The nature of human discourse was yet to be
explored. Happily, we have been in a different situa-
tion for some time. When the EEL (5, 6, 71 system was
getting into a reasonably sturdy shape with respect to
speed and bugs, I started planning experiments Co test
it. There was important literature about discourse,
especially in sociology, such as the work of Schegloff.
It was thus clear that successful NLI experiments had to
be based on knowledge of human discourse. It was also
clear that that was the way to make the interface more
natural. This assumption has already been fruitful:
the NL interface in POL (91, a successor to REL, has
already been extensively improved as a result of the
REL-related experiments.
Experiments were made in three modes: in addition to
face-to-face and human-to-computer, terminal-to-terminal
communication was examined, since at present that is the
only practical mode of accessing the computer. Through
early 1980, over 80 subjects, 80,000 words, and over 50
hours were analyzed in great detail. In the fall of
1980, another 13 subjects were tested in the computa-
tional mode only, adding approximately 20 hours. From
the start, the experiments were encouraging, although
limited to two modes: F-F and T-T. Interactions not
only showed a great deal of structure but extensive
similarities in both modes, the most important being the
constancy of the number of words in sentences (about
70%); the length of sentences (about 7 words); the
existence of fragments (70% of messages in F-F and 50%
in T-T containing them); and phatics (10% of total for
F-F and 5% for T-T). Thus similarities between the
modes were a candidate for consideration in experiments
in the computational mode, the T-T mode being seemingly
quite far removed from natural F-F. The sentence having
historically been the unit of analysis (and since phat-
ics were considered of lesser importance from the compu-
tational view, although of great interest in general),
my attention turned to fragments. REL allowed for three
non-sentence type structures: &amp;quot;NP?&amp;quot; (including number
parsed into NP); &amp;quot;all/none or number&amp;quot; answers; and
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999961692307692">
definitions introducible by the user which make it pos-
sible to include individual knowledge and terminology.
The analysis of F-F and T-T protocols, however, showed
the existence of other fragment categories, finally
analyzed into a dozen categories (see (81). Since they
constitute a considerable amount of F-F conversations
and even T-T protocols, they clearly had to be watched
for in computational experiments.
The experiments for actually observing user-system
interaction were conducted in the winter term of 1979/80
and produced 21 protocols, the analysis of which was
compared with results of eight F-F and four T-T experi-
ments. Another 13 computational experiments done in the
fall confirmed the results of the earlier ones. The
task in all three modes was a real one: loading cargo
onto a ship, the data coming from the actual environment
of loading U.S. navy ships by a group in San Diego, Cal-
ifornia. In the F-F and T-T experiments, two .persons
were involved -- one given cargo items to be loaded, the
other information about decks (details in Op. In the
computational mode (H-C) the ship data was in the com-
puter and the list of cargo to be loaded was handed to
the subjects, all with Caltech background. Details
being available elsewhere and space limited here, only
some major results are given here. Table 1 shove the
comparison of the three modes.

As can be seen, several statistica show similarities:
sentence length, message length, fragment length, per-
centage of words in sentences and fragments. The close-
ness of the average of messages in T-T and parsed and
nonparsed inputs in H-C is striking.
Table 2 (the meaning of abbreviations is given below the
table) deals with fragments. It is mostly self-
explanatory, as is the absence of definitions from F-F
and T-T (although some abbreviations used there fall in
this category) and the absence of some other categories
from T-T and H-C. At least two comments, however, are
necessary. The surprisingly low use of terse questions
in H-C may be accounted for by the tendency toward a
formal style in computational interaction. The defini-
tions used were often of quite complex character,
although far fever than could be hoped for due
apparently to lack of familiarity with this capability.
The complex character of definitions undoubtedly had
soma effect on the length of sentences in the H-C mode.

may be an elliptical structure of various forms.
ADD (Added Information): An elliptical structure,
often NP, used to clarify or complete a previous

CORR (Correction): This may be done by either speaker.
If done by the same speaker it is related to false

correction, e.g., &amp;quot;Those are 30, uh, 48 length by
40 width by 14 height.&amp;quot;
COMP (Completion): Completion of the other speaker&apos;s

SELF.(Talking_ to Oneself: Mutterings, even to the
point of undecipherability, not intended for the

B. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, SYNTAX USED, SPECIAL STRATEGIES,
AND ERROR ANALYSIS
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.99905796">
System performance can obviously be evaluated in a
number of ways, but without good response time meaning-
ful experiments are impossible. When much data is
involved in processing a delay of a few minutes can
probably be tolerated, but the vast majority of requests
should be responded to within seconds. The latter was
the case in my experiments. Fairly complex messages of
about 12 words were responded to in about 10 seconds.
The system clearly has to be reasonably free of bugs --
in my case, 12 bugs were hit in the total of 1615 parsed
and nonparsed messages. The adequate extent of natural
language syntax is impossible to determine. Table 3
shows the syntax used by my subjects.
An interesting fact to note is that similar results with
respect to syntax were obtained in the experiments with
USL, the &amp;quot;sister system&amp;quot; of REL developed by IBM Heidel-
berg [101 -- with German used as NLI in two studies of
high school students: predominance of wh-questions (317
in total of 451); not many relative clauses (66); com-
mands (35); conjunctions (26); quantifiers (15); defini-
tions (11); comparisons (2); yes/no questions (1).
An evaluation which would not include an analysis of
unparsed input would at best be of limited value. It
was shown in Table 1 that 1093 out of 1615 or about two
thirds were parsed in my experiments.

Considering the wide range of REL syntax [71, the pau-
city of complex sentences is surprising. The use of
definitions which often involved complex constructions
(relative clauses, conjunctions, even quantifiers) had a
definite influence. So did, undoubtedly, the task
situation causing optimization of work methods. The
influence of the specific nature of the task would
require additional studies, but the special device pro-
vided by the system (a loading prompt sequence -- which
was not analyzed) was employed by every subject. Dev-
ices such as these obviously are a great aid in accom-
plishing tasks. They should be tested extensively to
determine how they can augment the naturalness of NLIa.
Other reasons for the relatively simple syntax used were
special strategies: paraphrasing into simpler syntax
even though a sentence did not parse for other reasons;
&amp;quot;success strategy&amp;quot; resulting in repetitious simple

Table 4 summarizes the categories of errors. The
predominance of vocabulary is not surprising, but rela-
tively few syntactic errors are. In part this may be
due to the method of scoring in which errors were
counted only once, so if a sentence contained an unknown
vocabulary item (e.g. &amp;quot;On what decks of the Alamo mita
cargo be stored?&amp;quot;) but would have failed on syntactic
grounds as well, it would fall in the vocabulary
category. A comparison can be made here with Damerau&apos;s
study [111 of the use of the TQA system by the city
planning department in White Plains, at least with
regard to the total of queries to those completed: 788
to 513. So, again, roughly two thirds were parsed. In
other categories &amp;quot;parsing failure&amp;quot; is 147, &amp;quot;lookup
failures&amp;quot; 119, &amp;quot;nothing in data base&amp;quot; 61, &amp;quot;program

SOME CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99735728">
Norm Sondheimer suggested some questions we might try to
answer. What has been learned about user needs? What
most important linguistic phenomena to allow for? What
other kinds of interactions? Error analysis points in
the obvious directions of user needs, and so do the
types of sentences employed. While it is justified to
quit the search for an almost perfect grammar, it would
be a mistake to constrain it to the constructions used.
Improved naturalness can be achieved with diagnostics,
definitions, and devices geared to specific tasks such
as special prompting sequences. Some tasks clearly
require math in the NII. How good are systems? An
objective measurement is probably impossible, but the
percentage of requests processed might give some idea.
In the case of a task situation such as loading cargo
items, the percentage of task completion may signal both
system performance and user satisfaction. System
response times are a very important measure. The ques-
tionnaire method can and has been used (in the case of
MT and USL), but as yet there is too little experience
to measure user satisfaction. Users seem very good at
adapting to systems. They paraphrase, use success stra-
tegy, simplify syntax, use special devices -- what they
really do is maximize their performance with respect to
a given task.

What have we learned about running evaluations? It is
important to know what to look for,.therefore the need
for good knowledge of human to human discourse. Good
system response times are a sine qua mon. Controlled
experiments have the advantage of being replicable, a
crucial factor in arriving at evaluation criteria.
Determining user bias and experience may be important,
but even more so is user training. Controlled experi-
ments can show what methods are most effective (e.g. a
manual or study of protocols?). Study of user comments
phatic material -- gives some measure of user
(dis)satisfaction (I have seen &amp;quot;You lie,&amp;quot; but I have yet
to see &amp;quot;Good boy, youl&amp;quot;). Clearly, the best indication
of user satisfaction is whether he or she uses the sys-
tem again. Extensive long-term studies are needed for
that.
What should the future look like? Task oriented situa-
tions seem to be a promising environment for NLI. The
standards of NL systems performance will be set by the
users. Future evaluations? As Antoine de Saint-Exupery
wrote, &amp;quot;As for the Future, your task is not to foresee,
but to enable it.&amp;quot;
