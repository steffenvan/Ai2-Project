<bodyText confidence="0.999976384615385">
We describe a system, UNN-WePS for
identifying individuals from web pages us-
ing data from Semeval Task 13. Our sys-
tem is based on using co-presence of per-
son names to form seed clusters. These are
then extended with pages that are deemed
conceptually similar based on a lexical
chaining analysis computed using Roget’s
thesaurus. Finally, a single link hierarchical
agglomerative clustering algorithm merges
the enhanced clusters for individual entity
recognition. UNN-WePS achieved an aver-
age purity of 0.6, and inverse purity of 0.73.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848107142857">
Guha and Garg (2004) report that approximately
4% of internet searches are to locate named indi-
viduals. Yet, many people share the same name
with for example 157630 individuals in the UK
sharing the most common name ‘David Jones’
(UK statistics cited by Ash 2006). Consequently
identifying web pages on specific individuals is a
significant problem that will grow as everyone ac-
quires a web presence.
There are several proposed approaches to identi-
fying which individuals correspond to which web
pages. For example, Bollegala et al. (2007) pro-
pose augmenting queries in the style of relevance
feedback (Salton and Buckley 1990), Kalashnikov
(2007) treat Web Person Search (WePS) as a dis-
ambiguation problem whose objective is to distin-
guish individuals, whilst Wan et al. (2005) see
WePS as a clustering problem.
WePS has both similarities and differences to
word sense disambiguation (WSD). Both seek to
classify instances of usage, but in WSD the sense
inventory is fixed. WSD then is more amenable to
a classification solution where a system can be ef-
fectively trained using learning algorithms. In
WePS we do not know from the outset how many
individuals our pages correspond to. Consequently
we took the view that WePS is better seen as a
clustering rather than a classification problem.

1.1 Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964105263158">
Ambiguity is a common feature of WePS and
WSD. There are multiple types of ambiguity in the
relation between person names and entities that
confound overly simple approaches. Firstly, note
that some first names are also last names (Les Paul,
Michael Howard), and that some last names also
occur as given names (Woodrow Wilson Guthrie,
Martin Luther King). Consequently, an overly
simple name parser will easily be confused. Sec-
ondly many last names are also place names (Jack
London, William Manchester). Thus, if a last name
is not found in the names database, but is found in
the gazetteer, a name can be confused with a loca-
tion. Finally, we come to toponym ambiguity,
where the name of a place may correspond to sev-
eral locations. (For example, there are thirteen
places called Manchester, multiple Londons,
Washingtons etc.) Resolving toponyms is a re-
search problem itself (Leidner, 2004).

web pages and individuals, meaning that relative
frequency and rank form a harmonic series. In
other words some people will be associated with
many pages and increasingly more will be linked
to fewer. This has a strong link to disambiguation,
where an inaccurate algorithm may give inferior
performance to the strategy of always selecting the
most frequent sense.
Now if we consider the types of data that distin-
guish individuals, we might find colleagues,
friends, and family mentioned in web pages, in
addition to locations, dates, and topics of interest.
Of these, names are particularly useful, and we
define co-present names as names found in a web
page in addition to the name for which we are
searching.
Names are statistically useful, even though
many people share the same name. For example
there are 7640 individuals in the UK (for example)
that share the most popular female name “Margaret
Smith”. Given the population of the UK is ap-
proximately 60 million, the probability of even the
most common female name in the UK occurring
randomly is 1.27+10-4 (of course not all the indi-
viduals have web pages).
Now, Semeval WePS pages (Artiles 2007) have
been retrieved in response to a search for one
name. Often such web pages will contain addi-
tional names. The probability that a web page will
contain two names corresponding to two different
individuals is quite low (~ca 7x10-8). Conse-
quently co-present names form indicators of an
individual’s identity. These give accurate seed
points, which are critical to the success of many
clustering algorithms such as k-means (Jain et al.
1999)

1.3 Lexical Chain Text Similarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791304347826">
Not all WePS pages contain multiple names, or
even content in any form. Consequently we need to
distinguish between pages that are similar in mean-
ing to a page already in a seed cluster, those that
refer to separate entities, and those to be discarded
This was done by comparing the conceptual
similarity of the WePS pages using Roget’s thesau-
rus as the conceptual inventory. The approach was
described in Ellman (2000), where lexical chains
are identified from each document using Roget&apos;s
thesaurus. These chains are then unrolled to yield
an attribute value vector of concepts where the
values are given by repetition, type of thesaural
relation found, and textual cohesion. Thus, we are
not simply indexing by thesaural categories.
Vectors corresponding to different documents
can be compared to give a measure of conceptual
similarity. Roget’s thesaurus typically contains one
thousand sense entries divided by part of speech
usage, giving a total of 6400 entries. Such vectors
may be compared using many algorithms, although
a nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented in
Ellman (2000).

1.4 One Sense Per Discourse
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976545454545">
UNN-WePS was based on a deliberate strategy
that the success of an active disambiguation
method needed to exceed its overall error rate in
order to improve baseline performance. As such,
simple methods that improved overall success
modestly were preferred to complex ones that did
not. Consequently, to reduce the search space, we
used the ‘one sense per discourse’ heuristic (Gale
et al. 1992). This assumes that one web page
would not refer to two different individuals that
share a name.

UNN-WePS was made up of three components,
comprising modules to:

1. Create seed clusters that associated files
with person names other than those being

rived from Roget’s thesaurus.

erative clustering algorithm.

<bodyText confidence="0.995985333333333">
In detail, a part of speech tagger (Coburn et al.
2007) was used to identify sequences of proper
nouns. Person names were identified from these
sequences using the following simple names
‘grammar’ coupled with data from the US Census
(1990).

<bodyText confidence="0.999971714285714">
In the second step, conceptual similarity was de-
termined using the method and tool described in
Ellman (2000). Documents not allocated to seed
clusters, were compared for conceptual similarity
to all other documents. If similar to a document in
a seed cluster, the unallocated document was in-
serted into the seed cluster. If neither document nor
one to which it was similar too were in a seed clus-
ter, they were formed into a new seed cluster. Fi-
nally if document has &apos;meaningful&apos; content, but is
not conceptually similar to any other it is stored in
a singleton seed cluster otherwise, it is discarded.
In the final step, seed clusters were sorted by
size and merged using a single link hierarchical
agglomerative clustering algorithm to identify enti-
ties (Jain et al. 1999). The use of a single link
means that a document can only be associated with
one entity, which conforms to the ‘one sense per
discourse’ heuristic.
Further details of the UNN-WePS algorithm are
given in figure 2 below.

<bodyText confidence="0.9704485">
UNN-WePS achieved an average purity of 0.6, and
inverse purity of 0.73 in Semeval Task 13, achiev-
ing seventh position out of sixteen competing sys-
tems (Artiles et al. 2007). However there was con-
siderable variance in UNN-WePS results as shown
in graph 1 below.
Graph 1: UNN-WePS purity performance
Graph 1 shows the purity scores for UNN-WePS
on the Semeval 13 test data on three conditions: (1)
as submitted (solid line), (2) using the gazetteer
(dashed line), and (3) without the lexical chain
based similarity matching (dotted line).
Note although the purity is lower when similar-
ity matching is included the number of discarded
documents is approximately halved.
An examination of the data suggests that where
performance was especially poor it was due to ge-
nealogical data. Firstly this contains multiple indi-
viduals sharing the same name violating the ‘one
sense per discourse’ heuristic. Secondly genealogi-
cal data includes birth and death information which
was outside the scope of UNN-WePS. Further-
more, the large number of names confounds the
statistical utility of co-present names.

We have described a system, UNN-WePS that dis-
ambiguates individuals in web pages as required
for Semeval task 13 (Artiles et al. 2007).
UNN-WePS was composed of three modules.
The first formed seed clusters based on names pre-
sent in web pages other than the individual for
whom we are searching. The second used a lexical

chain based similarity measure to associates re-
maining files with clusters, whilst the third joined
the clusters to identify identities using a single link
hierarchical algorithm.
UNN-WePS performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the simplicity of its basic seeding algo-
rithm. The use however of the ‘one sense per dis-
course’ heuristic was flawed. Names do re-occur
across generations in families.
Genealogy is a popular Internet pastime, and
web pages containing genealogy data frequently
refer to multiple individuals that share a name at
different time periods. As UNN-WePS did not ac-
count for time, this could not be detected. Further-
more, the large number of names in on-line genea-
logical data does lead to spurious associations.
As WePS was time limited, several extensions
and refinements were envisaged, but not executed.
Firstly, as described, the world gazetteer (2007)
did not lead to performance improvements. We
speculate therefore the disambiguation effect from
using place names was exceeded by the ambiguity
introduced by using them blindly. We note espe-
cially the inference between unidentified names (or
street names, or building names) being interpreted
as place data.
A further system deficiency was the lack of rec-
ognition of date data. This is essential to differenti-
ate between identically named individuals in ge-
nealogical data.
Finally, we are currently experimenting with dif-
ferent clustering algorithms using the CLUTO
toolkit (Karypis 2002) to improve on UNN-WePS
baseline performance.

Such vectors may be compared using many algorithms, although a nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented in Ellman (2000). 1.4 One Sense Per Discourse UNN-WePS was based on a deliberate strategy that the success of an active disambiguation method needed to exceed its overall error rate in order to improve baseline performance. As such, simple methods that improved overall success modestly were preferred to complex ones that did not. Consequently, to reduce the search space, we used the ‘one sense per discourse’ heuristic (Gale et al. 1992). This assumes that one web page would not refer to two different individuals that share a name. 2 System Description UNN-WePS was made up of three components, comprising modules to: 1. Create seed clusters that associated files with person names other than those being searched for. 2.

Our system is based on using co-presence of person names to form seed clusters. These are then extended with pages that are deemed conceptually similar based on a lexical chaining analysis computed using Roget’s thesaurus. Finally, a single link hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm merges the enhanced clusters for individual entity recognition. UNN-WePS achieved an average purity of 0.6, and inverse purity of 0.73. 1 Introduction Guha and Garg (2004) report that approximately 4% of internet searches are to locate named individuals. Yet, many people share the same name with for example 157630 individuals in the UK sharing the most common name ‘David Jones’ (UK statistics cited by Ash 2006). Consequently identifying web pages on specific individuals is a significant problem that will grow as everyone acquires a web presence. There are several proposed approaches to identifying which individuals correspond to which web pages. For example, Bollegala et al.

Now, Semeval WePS pages (Artiles 2007) have been retrieved in response to a search for one name. Often such web pages will contain additional names. The probability that a web page will contain two names corresponding to two different individuals is quite low (~ca 7x10-8). Consequently co-present names form indicators of an individual’s identity. These give accurate seed points, which are critical to the success of many clustering algorithms such as k-means (Jain et al. 1999) 1.3 Lexical Chain Text Similarity Not all WePS pages contain multiple names, or even content in any form.

Consequently, an overly simple name parser will easily be confused. Secondly many last names are also place names (Jack London, William Manchester). Thus, if a last name is not found in the names database, but is found in the gazetteer, a name can be confused with a location. Finally, we come to toponym ambiguity, where the name of a place may correspond to several locations. (For example, there are thirteen places called Manchester, multiple Londons, Washingtons etc.) Resolving toponyms is a research problem itself (Leidner, 2004). 1.2 Statistics Statistics are a further relation between WePS and WSD.

Names do re-occur across generations in families. Genealogy is a popular Internet pastime, and web pages containing genealogy data frequently refer to multiple individuals that share a name at different time periods. As UNN-WePS did not account for time, this could not be detected. Furthermore, the large number of names in on-line genealogical data does lead to spurious associations. As WePS was time limited, several extensions and refinements were envisaged, but not executed. Firstly, as described, the world gazetteer (2007) did not lead to performance improvements. We speculate therefore the disambiguation effect from using place names was exceeded by the ambiguity introduced by using them blindly. We note especially the inference between unidentified names (or street names, or building names) being interpreted as place data. A further system deficiency was the lack of recognition of date data. This is essential to differentiate between identically named individuals in genealogical data.
