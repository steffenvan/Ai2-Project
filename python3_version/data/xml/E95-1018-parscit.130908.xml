<bodyText confidence="0.999922066666667">
Recent work within the field of Categorial
Grammar has seen the development of ap-
proaches that allow different modes of lo-
gical behaviour to be displayed within a
single system, something corresponding to
making available differing modes of lin-
guistic description. Earlier attempts to
achieve this goal have employed modal op-
erators called structural modalities, whose
use presents a number of problems. I pro-
pose an alternative approach, involving co-
existence and interrelation of different sub-
logics, that eliminates the need for struc-
tural modalities, whilst maintaining the de-
scriptive power they provide.

Categorial Grammar formalisms consist of logics.
Syntactic information (e.g. subcategorisation,
word order) is encoded in complex formulas or
types assigned to lexical items. Syntactic deriv-
ation is via deduction over lexical formulas. Al-
ternative systems differ in the logics they use,1
which may be classified by their limitations on
the use of &apos;resources&apos; (i.e. assumptions) in deduc-
tion, and their consequent sensitivity to the spe-
cific structuring of those resources (a comparison
which gives rise to the &apos;substructural hierarchy&apos;
of logics). In linguistic terms, such logics can be
seen to implement different possible views of the
nature of linguistic structure.
In the past few years, categorial systems have
been developed that allow access to the resource
behaviour of more than one level of the substruc-
tural hierarchy. This amounts to a recognition

that a full account of phenomena within a lan-
guage may require use of more than one notion
of linguistic structure, so that e.g. rigid tree-
like structures may be appropriate for one class
of phenomena (binding, perhaps), whereas more
flexible structures may be appropriate for another
(coordination, perhaps). Consideration of cross-
linguistic variation strengthens the case for allow-
ing multiple notions of structure.
One approach to creating systems with mixed
resource behaviour employs operators called
structural modalities. In such work, a specific re-
source logic is selected as &apos;basic&apos; for stating the
grammar, thereby setting the default characterist-
ics of resource sensitivity. Then, structural mod-
alities are used to allow controlled access to the
resource behaviour of other substructural levels.
Various problems — theoretical, computational
and practical — arise for the use of such oper-
ators. For example, where they are used extens-
ively, unduly complicated accounts tend to result.
Also, the need to have a single &apos;base logic&apos; presents
problems for the development of a truly general
cross-linguistic framework.
More recent work has seen the development
of approaches that have coexistence of different
sublogics within a single mixed or multimodal
system.2 Moortgat &amp; Oehrle (1993;1994) and
Hepple (1993) propose general approaches for
combining substructural logics into multimodal
systems, where &apos;movement between levels&apos; (en-
abled by structural modalities in the earlier work)
is freely allowed, provided it accords with what are
seen to be &apos;natural relations&apos; between the levels in
terms of the relative informativeness of their de-
scriptions. Although developed separately, these
two sources propose formal systems that are in
many ways similar, but, interestingly, take pre-
cisely opposing views as to what are the &apos;natural
relations&apos; between levels. This difference of opin-
ion has consequences for how the systems may be
used as linguistic formalisms (requiring, for ex-

2Some early examples of multimodal systems are
logics that have coexistence, but without interlink-
age, of associative and non-associative Lambek calcu-
lus (Oehrle &amp; Zhang 1989; Morrill 1990). Further ex-
amples include systems that combine associative Lam-
bek calculus with special connectives for discontinuity
(e.g. Morrill &amp; Solias 1993; Hepple 1994).

ample, &apos;additional apparatus&apos; for handling word
order in the second approach), and more crucially
for the kind of linguistic accounts they allow to be
formulated.
In this paper, I will describe the approach taken
in Hepple (1993) — what I call the &apos;hybrid&apos; ap-
proach, discuss the general linguistic model that
it tends to foster and provide some linguistic illus-
tration, and discuss possibilities for parsing hybrid
systems. I will begin with discussion of substruc-
tural hierarchy and structural modalities, as it is
the behaviour of systems with structural modalit-
ies that inspires the hybrid view of how different
levels should be related.

I will address only logics (or levels) having three
connectives: a &apos;product&apos; connective (a form of con-
junction, corresponding to &apos;matter-like addition&apos;
of substructures), plus two implicational connect-
ives (the left and right &apos;residuals&apos; of the product),
notated as I. and for a product o.

The Identity (id) and Cut rules express the re-

labelling, whereby each type is associated with a
lambda term (giving objects TYPE:term) in ac-
cordance with the well known Curry-Howard in-
terpretation of proofs, with the consequence that
complete proofs return a term that records the
proof&apos;s functional or natural deduction structure.
Such terms play an important role in the approach
to be developed. The system of term labelling has
the following features. All antecedent formulas are
associated with variables. Cut inferences are in-
terpreted via substitution (with a[b/v] represent-
ing the substitution of b for v in a). For implic-
ational connectives, Left and Right inferences are
interpreted via functional application and abstrac-
tion, respectively. A different abstraction and ap-
plication operator is used for each implicational
connective, so that terms fully record the proof
structure. The implication 4- (resp. &apos;L)) has ap-
plication operator 7, (resp. ), giving a*-0- b (resp.
67; a) for &apos;a applied to b&apos;, and abstraction oper-
ator [7,-] (resp. [T,]), e.g. [.]v.a (resp. riv.a) for
abstraction over v in a. Product Right inferences
are interpreted via system specific pairing. For
product Left inferences, a term such as [x/vow].a
represents the substitution of x for v-Ew in a.4
We must next consider the issue of resource
structure and its consequences for linguistic deriv-
ation. If we assume for the above sequent system
that antecedents are (non-empty) binarily brack-
etted sequences of types then we have a version of
the non-associative Lambek calculus (NL: Lam-
bek 1961), where deduction is sensitive to the or-
der and bracketting of assumptions, each of which
must be used precisely once in a deduction. NL is
a system whose implicit notion of linguistic struc-
ture is binary branching tree-like objects, and this
rigidity of structure is reflected in the type com-
binations that the system allows.&apos; However, it is
possible to undermine sensitivity to aspects of re-
source structure by inclusion of structural rules,
which act to modify the structure of the ante-
cedent configuration. For example, the follow-
ing rules of Permutation ([P]) and Association
GAD undermine sensitivity to the linear order and
bracketting of assumptions, respectively:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.75282575">
Adding [P] to NL gives NLP, a system whose
implicit notion of linguistic structure is binary

with linear logic by Benton et al. (1992).
&apos;Such characteristics of structure are reflected in
the systems of algebraic semantics that are provided

branching mobiles (since order is undermined only
within the confines of the given bracketting).
Adding [A] to NL gives a version of associative
Lambek calculus (L: Lambek 1961), which views
language purely in terms of strings of tokens. If
both [A] and [P] are added, we have the system LP
(van Benthem 1983), corresponding to a fragment
of linear logic (Girard 1987), which views lan-
guage in terms of unordered multisets of tokens.
I will adopt special notations for the operators
of these systems: NL:{0,k,56}, NLP:{e,e-,--e},
L:{.,\,/},
The proof below illustrates this formulation,
showing the composition of two implicationals (a
combination which requires associativity). If we
simplify the resulting proof term, using [&apos;;] for A

3 Structural modalities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974776">
Structural modalities are unary operators that
allow controlled involvement of structural rules
which are otherwise unavailable in a system,6
e.g. a modified structural rule might be included
that may only apply where one of the types af-
fected by its use are marked with a given modal-
ity. For example, a unary operator A, allowing
controlled permutation, might have the following
rules (where Ar indicates a configuration in which
all types are of the form AX):
Ar A : a rp3 : 19] A : a
[AR] [AL]
F[(AB: b, C: c)°] rZ. A : a
[AP]
me: c, AB: b)°] A: a
The Left and Right rules are as for necessity in
S4. The restricted permutation rule [AP] allows
any formula of the form AX to permute freely, i.e.
undermining linear order for just this assumption.
The left rule [AL] allows a A-marking to be freely
discarded. Such a modality has been used in treat-
ments of extraction. The calculus L &apos;respects&apos; lin-
ear order, so that s/np or np \s corresponds to a
sentence missing a NP at its right or left peri-
phery. However, a type s/(Anp) corresponds to
a sentence missing NP at some position, and so

gic&apos;s `exponentials&apos;. See Barry et a/. (1991) for some
structural modalities having suggested linguistic uses.
is suitable for use in the general case of extrac-
tion, where a NP extraction site may occur non
peripherally within a clause. Proof A in Figure 1
illustrates (proof terms are omitted to simplify).
Structural modalities allow that stronger logics
may be embedded within weaker ones, via embed-
ding translations, i.e. so that a sequent is deriv-
able in the stronger logic if its translation into
the weaker logic plus relevant modalities is also
derivable. For example, using A, a fragment of
LP may be embedded within L.

Imagine how an LP formula XOY might be
&apos;translated&apos; into the system `1.. plus A&apos; (&apos;LA&apos;).
This formula shows the interderivability XOY
YOX. A corresponding &apos;reordering&apos; interderivab-
ility would be allowed if XOY translated to any
of (AX).(AY) or X.(AY) or (AX).Y, i.e. with
either or both of the product subcomponents mod-

may legitimately appear in either order). Such
As may be &apos;dropped&apos;, e.g. (AX).(AY) X.Y,

mitted orders. This latter transformation suggests
XOY = X.Y as a theorem of a mixed logic, re-
vealing a natural relation between XOY and X.Y,
as if the former were in some sense &apos;implicitly
modalised&apos; relative to the latter.
Consider next the implicational Xo-Y, which
exhibits the interderivability Xo-Y Y-oX.
This suggests the translation X/(AY), for which
we observe MAY) &lt;=&gt; (AY) \ X. LA allows
X/Y = X/(AY), suggesting X/Y Xo-Y as a
&apos;linking&apos; theorem of a mixed logic revealing the
natural relation between Xo-Y and X/Y.
The above discussion suggests how the systems
L and LP might be interrelated in a logic where
they coexist. Such relation might be justified
in terms of allowing transitions involving forget-
ting of information, i.e. XOY indicates that both
orders are possible for its subcomponents, and
the move to X.Y (or YoX) involves forgetting
one of these possibilities. Generalising from this
case, we expect that for any two sublogics in a
mixed system, with products oi and oj, where
the former is the stronger logic (including more
structural rules), we will observe transformations:
XoiY = XoiY and X■°2-Y = V-Y.

term x&apos;E y, the permutativity of 0 suggests that
both orderings of x and y are possible. Note
however that word order determination must be

their properties, e.g. the non-associativity of 0
implies an &apos;integrity&apos; for y, z in x&apos;,1-; (y.5 z) exclud-
ing y x z as a possible order, despite the

7 The linguistic model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998146969697">
I noted earlier that extensive use of structural
modalities tends to result in very complex ana-
lyses. This fact tends to favour the selection of
stronger systems for the base level logic, a move
which is associated with loss of possibly useful re-
source sensitivity. This problem does not arise for
the hybrid approach, which freely allows us to use
weaker logics for constructing lexical types that
richly encode linguistic information.
Consider firstly a hybrid system that includes
only the two levels L and LP, of which clearly L
will in general be more appropriate for linguistic
description. Under the view of how levels are re-
lated that I have argued for, the linkage between
these two levels is such that X0Y = X.Y is a
theorem, alongside which we will find also (e.g.)
X/Y = Xo—Y. Note that it is the latter theorem,
and its variants, that most crucially bear upon
what is gained by the move to a mixed system,
given that the lexical encoding of linguistic in-
formation predominantly involves the assignment
of functional types. Hence, a lexical functor con-
structed with L connectives may be transformed
to one involving LP connectives, allowing us to
exploit the structural freedom of that level.&apos; For
&apos;Note that with the converse direction of linkage,
as advanced by Moortgat &amp; Oehrle (1993), but with
lexical functors still constructed using L connectives,
no practical use could be made of the permutative LP
level in this minimal mixed system.

ing NP somewhere&apos; may be derived as so—np, as
in proof B of Figure 1.
Consider next a system that includes also the
non-associative level NL. This additional level
might be adopted as the principal one for lex-
ical specification, giving various advantages for
linguistic analysis. For example, by having a lex-
ical element subcategorise for a complement that
is some &apos;non-associative functor&apos; (i.e. of the form
AB or IAA), we could be sure that the com-
plement taken was a &apos;natural projection&apos; of some
lexical head, and not one built by composition
(or other associativity based combination). On
the other hand, where the freedom of associative
combination is required, it is still available, given
that we have (e.g.) X9SY X/Y. Some categorial
treatments of non-constituent coordination have
depended crucially (either implicitly or explicitly)
on associativity allowing, for example, subject and
verb to be combined without other verb comple-
ments, making possible a &apos;like-with-like&apos; coordina-
tion treatment of non-constituent coordination as
in e.g. (i) Mary spoke and Susan whispered, to Bill
(where the conjuncts are each analysed as s/pp).
In a purely non-associative system, such as NL,
such an analysis is excluded. In the hybrid ap-
proach, however, this treatment is still possible
even with non-associative lexical types, provided
coordination is done at the associative level, e.g.
the conjuncts of (i) can be derived and coordin-
ated as ship since: np, (nAs)Opp s/pp is a
theorem as in (5). Furthermore, since we have
also X9SY Xo—Y, such non-associative lexical
specification is still compatible with the treatment
of extraction described above.

It is hoped that the above simple examples
of linguistic uses will serve to give a feeling for
the general character of the linguistic model that
the hybrid approach would favour, i.e. one with
very rich lexical encoding of syntactic informa-
tion, achieved using predominantly the implica-
tional connectives of the weakest available logic,
with the stronger logics of the mixed system al-
lowing less informative (but hence also more &apos;flex-
ible&apos;) descriptions of (functional) linguistic ob-
jects. The above example systems clearly do not
exhaust the possibilities for &apos;rich lexical encoding&apos;.

It is well known that parsing (theorem proving)
with sequent formalisms suffers efficiency prob-
lems as a consequence of derivational equivalence
(or &apos;spurious ambiguity&apos;), i.e. from the existence
of multiple proofs that assign the same meaning
for a given type combination. Alternative but
equivalent formalisations of the above system are
possible. Hepple (1993), for example, provides a
natural deduction formalisation. Such a formal-
isation should readily provide the basis for a chart
based approach to parsing hybrid logic grammars,
after the manner of existing chart methods for use
with L (KOnig 1990; Hepple 1992). A further
promising possibility for efficient parsing of hy-
brid system grammars involves proof net reformu-
lation, following a general scheme for such refor-
mulation described in Moortgat (1992). However,
the precise character of either chart or proof net
based methods for parsing hybrid system gram-
mars is a topic requiring further research.

9 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977888888889">
As noted earlier, the approach described here
has strong similarities to one developed independ-
ently by Moortgat &amp; Oehrle (1993), although they
take a precisely opposing view as to what consti-
tute the appropriate directions of linkage between
levels. One consequence of this difference is to
allow them a more standard treatment of word
order (not requiring an enriched term labelling al-
gebra). The most important &apos;practical&apos; difference
is that the differing directions of &apos;natural move-
ment&apos; will tend to foster very different linguistic
accounts. We may ask which of these two contra-
dicting views of linkage is correct. Hepple (TO AP-
PEAR) suggests that both views are possible, and
may even be compatible for realisation within a
single system, further extending the possibilities
for the multimodal systems that can be construc-
ted and for their potential utility.
In conclusion, I have described an approach in
which different sublogics coexist and are interre-
lated within a single categorial system. This gives
an approach which allows access to a range of dif-
ferent modes of characterising linguistic structure,
where the specific mode of description that is used
in any case can be chosen as that which is appro-
priate for the aspect of linguistic phenomena that
is under consideration.

Various problems — theoretical, computational and practical — arise for the use of such operators. For example, where they are used extensively, unduly complicated accounts tend to result. Also, the need to have a single &apos;base logic&apos; presents problems for the development of a truly general cross-linguistic framework. More recent work has seen the development of approaches that have coexistence of different sublogics within a single mixed or multimodal system.2 Moortgat &amp; Oehrle (1993;1994) and Hepple (1993) propose general approaches for combining substructural logics into multimodal systems, where &apos;movement between levels&apos; (enabled by structural modalities in the earlier work) is freely allowed, provided it accords with what are seen to be &apos;natural relations&apos; between the levels in terms of the relative informativeness of their descriptions.

If we assume for the above sequent system that antecedents are (non-empty) binarily bracketted sequences of types then we have a version of the non-associative Lambek calculus (NL: Lambek 1961), where deduction is sensitive to the order and bracketting of assumptions, each of which must be used precisely once in a deduction. NL is a system whose implicit notion of linguistic structure is binary branching tree-like objects, and this rigidity of structure is reflected in the type combinations that the system allows.&apos; However, it is possible to undermine sensitivity to aspects of resource structure by inclusion of structural rules, which act to modify the structure of the antecedent configuration.

I would like to thank Ruth Kempson, Natasha Kurtonina, Michael Moortgat, Glyn Morrill and Yde Venema for valuable discussions of the ideas in this paper. 1For example, associative Lambek calculus (Lambek 1958), non-associative Lambek calculus (Lambek 1961), a permutative variant of associative Lambek calculus known as LP (van Benthem 1983), the &apos;headed&apos; systems of Moortgat &amp; Morrill (1991). that a full account of phenomena within a language may require use of more than one notion of linguistic structure, so that e.g. rigid treelike structures may be appropriate for one class of phenomena (binding, perhaps), whereas more flexible structures may be appropriate for another (coordination, perhaps). Consideration of crosslinguistic variation strengthens the case for allowing multiple notions of structure. One approach to creating systems with mixed resource behaviour employs operators called structural modalities.

Then, structural modalities are used to allow controlled access to the resource behaviour of other substructural levels. Various problems — theoretical, computational and practical — arise for the use of such operators. For example, where they are used extensively, unduly complicated accounts tend to result. Also, the need to have a single &apos;base logic&apos; presents problems for the development of a truly general cross-linguistic framework. More recent work has seen the development of approaches that have coexistence of different sublogics within a single mixed or multimodal system.2 Moortgat &amp; Oehrle (1993;1994) and Hepple (1993) propose general approaches for combining substructural logics into multimodal systems, where &apos;movement between levels&apos; (enabled by structural modalities in the earlier work) is freely allowed, provided it accords with what are seen to be &apos;natural relations&apos; between the levels in terms of the relative informativeness of their descriptions. Although developed separately, these two sources propose formal systems that are in many ways similar, but, interestingly, take precisely opposing views as to what are the &apos;natural relations&apos; between levels.
