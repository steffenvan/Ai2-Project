antecedent(s), and no special arc between the variable
and the consequent(s). Both representations have
nodes representing the propositions of the
antecedent(s) and the consequent(s). Looked at in
this way, Fahlman&apos;s restriction that &amp;quot;No clause may be
part of the specification of more than one *EVERY..
node&amp;quot; [p. 161] can be seen as eliminating the possibil-
ity of representing statements of the form (Ax)(Ay)
{S(x,y) -&gt; I(x,y)].
Before concluding, I must make one comment on a
passage which I fear illustrates a common attitude
among Al researchers. Fahlman points out that, &amp;quot;If
an object is said to exist within an area, that means
that it exists somewhere within the area; if a statement
is said to be valid within an area, it means that it is
valid everywhere within the area&amp;quot; [p. 114, italics in the
original]. He then comments that &amp;quot;This difference in
the behavior of existence and statement-scoping came
as something of a surprise to me -- I am told that the
logicians have known something of this sort all along,
but they tend not to express it in these terms. This
difference caused a lot of trouble until I understood
what was happening&amp;quot; [p. 1151. The first point is that
this is a _nice statement of the reason Al researchers
should study logic. Perhaps, if he had, Fahlman would
have been saved a lot of trouble. The other point is
that if a researcher discovers that he has rediscovered
a distinction or issue already discussed by others in
different terms, he should rewrite his own discussion
in the existing terms, giving the appropriate credit and
providing the connections to his readers, not dismiss
the older work in a couple of sentences and contribute
to the proliferation of jargon. The issue is no less
than the respectability of Al.
What makes these complaints more serious is that
this book represents a good piece of work, already
having an impact on the &amp;quot;knowledge representation&amp;quot;
community. It is certainly must reading for anyone
also involved in the inheritance hierarchy brand of
representation.

In 1970 the Advanced Research Projects Agency
decided to fund six research projects aimed at devel-
oping systems that were capable of understanding
connected speech. From 1971 to 1975, this research
was carried out. This book is a collection of articles
(most of which have been published separately) which
grew out of the final report of the speech understand-
ing group at SRI International. Despite its title, its
stated purpose is to describe SRI&apos;s speech understand-
ing system rather than speech understanding in gener-
al, and it contains much material pertinent to under-
standing written language as well as speech.
Although the introductory and concluding material
attempts to unify the book, it remains a collection of
very separate articles rather than a unified whole. As
a consequence it suffers from the common problems of
books of this type: inadequate cross referencing, poor
transitions between chapters, and no index. The ab-
sence of an index is a serious problem that is com-
pounded by the fact that the table of contents contains
only three levels of structure; more detailed outlines of
the contents are found at the beginning of each chap-
ter. Fortunately the references have been merged into
a single list. The reference list is very good, in part
because it is not too long to scan easily.
The signal processing part of speech understanding
is given the barest mention because SRI did not do
work in that area; the book concentrates on the higher
level aspects of the understanding process.
The first chapter is a nicely written introduction
and overview by Donald Walker. It describes the
organization of the ARPA speech understanding effort
and outlines the SRI system. The second chapter, by
William Paxton, quickly plunges the reader into a rath-
er detailed description of the language definition sys-
tem which was used to define the language that the
system would understand. These definitions were then
compiled into a form that the executive system, which
controlled the other components of the system, would
understand. The language definition consisted of a
lexicon (words and &amp;quot;multiwords&amp;quot; with grammatical
categories, grammatical features, and associated se-
mantic information) and composition rules (phrase
structure rules augmented by procedures to be execut-
ed whenever the rule constructs a phrase). The proce-
dures gave values to attributes of the phrase as a func-
tion of the attributes of its constituents and judged the
acceptability of the phrase on a number of grounds
such as acoustic properties, syntactic properties (such
as mood and number), semantic properties (using the
semantic network representation discussed further on),
and discourse information to handle anaphora and
ellipsis. Much of the complexity of the language defi-
nition derives from the fact that it must screen out bad
input rather than just recognize good input as many
grammars do.
In discussing the executive system itself, much
space is devoted to historical background, comparisons
with other speech understanding systems, and the ex-
perimentation (using analysis of variance) that was

done to determine the best control strategy to use.
The control issues that were tested were left to right
processing through the sentence versus an &amp;quot;island
driven&amp;quot; strategy, examining all the words that might
be present in a given location at once versus taking
them one at a time, doing time-consuming but accurate
context checking as soon as possible versus delaying
such checking, and focusing the processing on a single
hypothesis versus skipping around to whatever hypoth-
esis seemed best at the time. The average reader will
probably be more interested in the results of the ex-
periments than the details of them, however.
The third chapter explains the semantic component
of the system, which was represented by the parti-
tioned network scheme of Gary Hendrix. With many
detailed examples, Hendrix shows how the partitioning
scheme was used to encode quantifiers and logical
connectives (conjunction, disjunction, negation, impli-
cation), to form associations between semantic objects
and the syntactic units of the input, to distinguish
between new and old information, to encode multiple
hypotheses, to allow sharing of representations among
competing hypotheses, and to define hierarchies for
discourse analysis. The semantic component of the
system used this formalism to filter out combinations
of words that were acoustically and syntactically ac-
ceptable but semantically unacceptable; it also con-
structed a representation of the meaning of good inter-
pretations for other components to use, and could
make predictions of words or structures that were
likely to occur in other parts of the utterance.
The next chapter is devoted to Barbara Grosz&apos;s
work on discourse knowledge. After showing exam-
ples of how the focus of a dialogue affects the identifi-
cation of definite noun phrases, word sense interpreta-
tion, pronominal reference, and ellipsis, she discusses
(again, in more detail than some readers would wish)
the analysis of actual problem solving and question
answering dialogs which were examined to provide the
basis for a representation of focus that would enable
the SRI system to use focus in its semantic interpreta-
tions. The notion of focus spaces which was derived
from these experiments was represented in Hendrix&apos;s
partitioned network formalism and used for resolution
of noun phrases, inferencing, reference resolution, and
other high level aspects of sentential processing. The
problems of shifting focus, reinvoking an old focus of
attention, and dealing with ellipsis are also covered in
detail.
The fifth chapter comprises three sections relating
to the problem of responding to an utterance once it
has been understood. This is unfortunately limited in
scope, since the major emphasis of the project was on
understanding rather than responding to spoken lan-
guage. Gary Hendrix writes on the problem of inter-
acting with the deduction component and an English
generator to formulate a reply. Richard Fikes and
Gary Hendrix detail the deduction component, and
Jonathan Slocum&apos;s section deals with generating an
English description of a semantic structure. The con-
clusion, written by Ann Robinson, summarizes the
work and points out issues relating to other areas of
research.
One of the chief features of the book is the large
number of illustrations and detailed examples, includ-
ing as an appendix a short but well chosen example of
the entire processing of a single utterance.
Someone already familiar with the ARPA speech
project will gain little from this book, and someone
interested in a general overview of the speech under-
standing problem and the ARPA project&apos;s results
would do better to look elsewhere [1, 21. What this
book has to offer is something rare but not unimpor-
tant in the literature: a detailed description of a single
large and complex system. One can get from it not
only an understanding of how that system worked but
also an excellent understanding of the important pieces
of that work which have had a continuing influence in
the field of computational linguistics since the termina-
tion of this particular project.

This book can be reviewed from two perspectives:
(1) as a general and technical introduction to the com-
plexities and subtleties regarding human understanding
of and response to questions and (2) as a much more
comprehensive system, intended to produce not only
humanlike interpretations of questions, but doing so in
ways that model human thought processes. Lehnert
appears to have both approaches in mind, emphasizing
the second more, but it is with respect to only the first
that the book is successful.
From this first perspective, then, there is no other
single source that so completely and persuasively illus-
trates the many-faceted problems of translating a
person&apos;s question (e.g., &amp;quot;Do you have a match?&amp;quot; vs.
&amp;quot;Do you have a hangover?&amp;quot;) into a valid interpreta-
tion of the questioner&apos;s desires or information require-
ments (e.g., &amp;quot;Give me a light&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;How is your physi-
cal state after last night?&amp;quot;). Lehnert provides abun-
dant evidence for the necessity of utilizing a wide
