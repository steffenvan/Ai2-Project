This paper introduces Dialogue Macrogame
Theory, a method for describing the organization
of certain kinds of dialogues. Dialogue
Macrogame Theory (DMT) is a successor to a
theory sometimes called Dialogue Game Theory,
developed in the 1970s and 1980s at USC-
Information Sciences Institute (ISI). DMT is able
to describe substantially more dialogues than its
predecessor, and it identifies kinds of mechanisms
not included in the predecessor. DMT is a step
toward accounting for the coherence of entire
dialogues.
The major structures in DMT are based on
intentions which are imputed to dialogue
participants. The focus of this paper is on
mechanisms. Dialogue Macrogames are defined.
Another class of mechanisms, called Unilaterals, is
also described.
A DMT analysis is presented. The analyzed
dialogue is an excerpt (41 turns) of actual dialogue
from the Apollo 13 mission, from the emergency
period after the explosion.
DMT is then related to another dialogue analysis
method (Carletta, Isard et al. 1997).
DMT is an exercised framework, meaning that it
has been applied to dialogues from a diversity of
situations. These include various emergency
communications, tutoring, administrative
interactions, online human computer help, medical
interviews, laboratory conversational tasks,
courtroom questioning of witnesses and hostage
negotiation. The paper reports work in progress,
and also indicates likely courses of further
development.

Dialogue Macrogame Theory is designed to enable
analysis of particular natural dialogues. Some
dialogues can be analyzed with DMT; some
cannot. Where it fits, DMT gives a partial
technical characterization of the classes of
dialogues represented in the analyses. This paper
is focused on presenting the elements of the theory.
Other presentations are expected to describe its
application and validation.
In the late 1970s a research team at USC-
Information Sciences Institute (ISI) studied natural
dialogues with particular interest in applying the
results to human-computer interaction. The team
produced a series of reports (Mann 1979) (Mann,
Carlisle et al. 1977) (Mann, Carlisle et al. 1975), a
published paper by Levin and Moore (Levin and
Moore 1977) and later another paper, entitled
Dialogue Games: Conventions of Human
Interaction (Mann 1988). These publications arose
out of the study of many natural dialogues. The
final theoretical summary was presented in the
form of a technical method for representing the
short range and long range dialogue structures.
Recent work has attempted to apply this set of
structures to additional dialogues. This effort has
identified a number of deficiencies of the
framework, which have led to making a fresh start
rather than adjustment.
The central constructs in the prior work were
called Dialogue Games, a name inspired by
terminology of Wittgenstein (Wittgenstein 1973)
but with only a distant family resemblance to his
usage. Since the end of that work this term has
been used in many other ways that are not
technically related to the ISI usage. In addition, the
terms dialogue act, conversational act, and
conversational game are in wide use (Carlson
1983) (Kreutel and Matheson 2001) (Traum 1994;
Poesio and Traum 1998; Traum 1999) .
To simply resume using the old terminology now
would invite confusion and misunderstanding. So
this paper introduces a new term, Dialogue
Macrogame, which represents some structures that
resemble the dialogue games of the predecessor
model. In this paper, Dialogue Macrogame may
be abbreviated to dialogue game or even game.
The term dialogue represents two party immediate
interaction.1
Studies of dialogue from various points of view are
numerous. There are dozens of technical fields
with the word communication in their names
(Craig 1999). Many of them study dialogue. There
are structural views, communication views and
many others. Linguistics tends to produce
structurally oriented studies, but not exclusively.
Even restricting attention to studies of dialogue
coherence, there are many radically different
viewpoints. Conversational Coherence: Form,
Structure and Strategy (Craig and Tracy 1983) is a
particularly relevant collection, now somewhat
dated but representing ideas that persist in the
wider literature. In this book, and in the wider
literature as well, the distinction between
coherence and cohesion is often not made. Studies
of coherence are often really about abstract
cohesive devices, in the sense of (Halliday and
Hasan 1976). Some studies (Ellis 1983; Goldberg
1983) assume that coherence is produced by
design, by appropriate use of cohesive devices.
In some studies coherence is equated to topic
continuity or to the appropriate use of topic
shifting devices (Crow 1983; Sigman 1983). In
others it is seen as conformity to expressive rules.
Grice is often interpreted as believing that
conversational coherence is based on rule (or
maxim) following (Grice 1975). Still others see
coherence as an identifiable outcome of rule
governed (social or linguistic) behavior (Goldberg
1 Sometimes DMT structures can be applied to
interactions that have more than two participants. Even
so, dialogue macrogame theory would have to be
significantly augmented in order to become a sound
representation scheme for multiparty interaction.
Knowing of these complications, we focus on two party
interaction as a research tactic.
1983). Hawes defends his views against this idea
(Hawes 1983).
Some studies of coherence in dialogue assume that
people pursue a tacit goal of being coherent, in
addition to any other goals, when they interact. It is
a benefit which they seek. (Hopper attributes this
orientation to interpreters of language, but not
producers (Hopper 1983).) Others see coherence as
an obligation that is attached to interaction. It is an
added duty. (Sanders sees this view as widely
accepted, and defends his views against it (Sanders
1983).)
Some studies equate coherence with propositional
consistency, see (Goldberg 1983) for citations.
Others see coherence as a kind of summary
impression that is a side effect of understanding an
interaction, an understanding that is enabled by the
processes that ordinarily govern interaction
(Sanders 1983).
The (Craig and Tracy 1983) book incorporates an
admirable attempt to make the various approaches
comparable. All of the chapter authors were given
one particular 30 minute dialogue (included in the
volume) and told to relate their approaches to it. In
a volume summary, apropos of this paper, the
editors note that
“Conversationalists’ goals must play a
central role in any adequate explanation of
discourse production and interpretation in
conversations.” p. 22.
Global approaches to coherence, ones that attempt
to address entire texts or dialogues, are often
associated with some notion of genre or tradition,
such as Rummelhardt’s story grammars
(Rumelhart 1975) or Schank and Abelson’s scripts
(Schank and Abelson 1977). (DMT addresses
whole dialogues, but without resemblance to those
approaches.)
There is more recent progress in many aspects of
understanding dialogue. A rich array of formal
approaches has been built on the Discourse
Representation Theory of Kamp and colleagues
(Kamp and Reyle 1993) (Traum 1994). Agency
theory, along with various vigorous efforts to
develop data annotation methods, are also
producing insightful views of natural dialogue.
Clearly there is no consensus on the nature of
coherence in dialogue. Although comparing views
is typically difficult, as researchers we always find
some views more credible than others. We may be
able to make certain alternatives more distinct by
an analogy concerning oral dialogue. What is the
status of breathing? Do people breathe in dialogue
because they believe it will make the dialogue
more beneficial? Or is there a duty to breathe in
dialogue? Is breathing simply following a tradition,
or an attempt to perform smoothly? Are there rules
of dialogue that would, for example, make a
dialogue ill-formed if it did not involve breathing?
Or is breathing regulated by processes that interact
with the speaking processes? DMT is designed
following assumptions that most resemble this
latter alternative.

3 Research Goals:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989725333333333">
A major goal of Dialogue Macrogame Theory
(DMT) is to provide a descriptive account for the
coherence of a wide diversity of natural dialogues.
A dialogue is said to be coherent if a person who
has good access to the dialogue is left with the
impression that every part of the dialogue
contributed to the remainder, or equivalently that
there are no parts whose presence is not easily
explained.2 This definition of coherence is parallel
to a definition for monologue texts. That
definition says that every part of the text has an
evident role, and that there are no apparent
deletions.
Instead, we seek to find a set of theories that can
jointly account for the coherence of dialogues that
arise in different kinds of situations. We hope that
the set will be small, but also that the set of
theories will be very informative. DMT is
designed to be one such theory.
Size limitations and incomplete development
prevent this paper from describing all of the
significant aspects of DMT. We choose to describe
only the elements which are part of DMT analysis.
In future presentations we expect to describe
dialogue analysis methods, framework validation,
some form/framework relationships, and
relationships to prior methods. We also expect to
provide a corpus of analyzed dialogues.
This work puts a high value on expanding the
coverage of the set of theories mentioned above.
This is in effect a personal preference for placing a
high value on breadth rather than depth or
precision.
We can say something preliminary about the
degree of confirmation of DMT. As mentioned
above, although the predecessor theory expressed
some insights about dialogues, it was generally not
precise enough to be applied reliably. Details had
been missed. DMT has been applied to a much
wider range of dialogues. The forthcoming release
of a corpus of analyzed dialogues will show this,
and the structures described below all reflect
details of actual natural dialogues.
Near the end of this paper there is an example of
an analysis of a natural dialogue, illustrating use of
each kind of element of DMT.
Notice that the definition of coherence does not
refer to turns, does not require that there be distinct
turns, and in particular does not require that turns
be coherent monologues. 4 Intentions in Dialogue:
The assumptions of DMT include saying that not
all dialogue situations are alike, and that the
differences between dialogue situations affect the
dynamics of the dialogues which occur in them.
We therefore do not expect to discover a single
theory that accurately describes the coherence of
all natural dialogues.
2 For research purposes, the impressions of dialogue
participants themselves are generally not available.
Researchers’ impressions of dialogue transcripts and
records are virtually the only source, so those
impressions are the object of study.
Dialogue coherence arises from the intentions (also
called goals) of the dialogue participants. It arises
especially from the way that the conventions of
dialogue cause the participants to adopt and
dismiss groups of intentions. Grouping of
intentions is the foundation for coordination of the
activities of dialogue participants. It provides a
way of introducing joint goals into a dialogue, and,
equally important, a way of dismissing goals from
a dialogue, all under the shared control of both
participants.
The view of intentions here follows (Mann 2001),
which identified a set of attributes of intentions
that can be found in the literature of intentions in
language. That view makes use of (Bratman 1987;
Clark 1996; Gibbs 1999). The view of joint
intentions, and of joint actions where they occur,
generally follows Clark, who follows (Tuomela
2000).

5 Dialogue Macrogames:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99742275">
The major construct of Dialogue Macrogame
Theory is, of` course, the dialogue macrogame. A
(dialogue macro)game is defined as a set of three
goals:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999465333333333">
1. A goal of the initiator
2. A goal of the responder
3. A joint goal
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987532">
A dialogue macrogame is a convention, loosely
comparable to a lexical item or a grammatical
pattern. DMT expects that people will hold
hierarchic goal structures, in general but especially
for embedded uses of games. However, these three
goals are not in hierarchic configuration. When a
game is used, the goal of the initiator and the joint
goal will be in the memory of the initiator as
commitments. (DMT does not constrain the
relationship of these two.) Similarly, the goal of
the responder and the joint goal will be in the
memory of the responder as commitments. In each
memory, the two goals are committed and un-
committed simultaneously, and at the same time
each person’s knowledge of the other’s
commitments is adjusted. How this happens, and
how grounding can be continuous, are described
below.
One of the games is named the Information
Offering game. Like all of the other games, a
single occurrence of this game can be used to
account for an indefinitely long interval of
interaction. Currently in DMT there are about 19
defined games.
The definition of the Information Offering game is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.895560857142857">
1. goal of the to provide particular
initiator:
information to recipient
2. goal of the to identify and receive the
responder: particular information offered
3. joint goal: the responder comes to possess
the particular information
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999899634920635">
These, of course, are not fully specified goals.
Rather, they (and all of the goals of the framework)
have places for unspecified arguments, such as the
particular information above. DMT does not
assume that the dialogue is task oriented; if it is,
the goals of a particular use of a game may be task
goals, and a particular goal can appear in more
than one position in a game use.
All of the individual participants’ goals that are
used in DMT games have the following attributes
in the (Mann 2001) framework: partialness,
priorness, tacitness, immediacy , interaction-
configuring, intended to be recognized,
structuredness, complementarity, conventionality.
The joint goals have the additional attribute of
jointness, and they lack complementarity.
The course of a dialogue between peers is
generally under the control of both participants.
They coordinate and jointly control by means of
particular kinds of actions. DMT uses a
negotiation metaphor to describe this. A game is
bid by the initiator, and the responder accepts or
refuses the bid. These actions are almost always
implicit, but certain situations (especially the
diagnosis of misunderstanding) can cause them to
become explicit. Similarly, games terminate by
negotiation. If a game has been bid and the bid has
been accepted the game is open.
Either party can bid termination of a game, and the
other can either accept termination or refuse it by
continuing to pursue the game. Games often end
by apparent accomplishment of the joint goals of
the game, which is the most common form of
bidding termination. Abandoning the goals of the
game accepts termination. So for example giving
an answer to a question will generally be seen by
both parties as the moment when pursuing the
question should end. Thus apparent satisfaction
of the game goals bids termination. There are other
ways to terminate a game. The scope of a game is
the entire interval during which it is in use,
including the initial bid of the game and the final
acceptance of termination.
If a bid to initiate a game is refused, as can happen
for example when one person offers information
that the other person does not need, then the game
never becomes open, and the joint goal of
providing the offered information is never taken
up.
Occurrences of games can contain occurrences of
other games or the same game within their scopes;
they are mutually recursive. The representations in
DMT are really only about the beginnings and ends
of game scopes, not about how the goals are
pursued. It is thus a very partial view of dialogue
structure. It generally does not represent all of the
goals of a participant. If the dialogue is task
oriented, there are task goals that may not be
represented. The control of the interaction will
tend to be well represented, but private and long
term goals less so. Since DMT applies to entire
dialogues, it supplements views of sentences, turns
or inherently small collections of turns in dialogue.

6 Unilaterals:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981518518519">
It turns out that most dialogues do not consist
entirely of goal pursuit that could be represented
by dialogue macrogames. Other things happen,
even when the major activity is joint goal pursuit.
DMT has a class of actions that do not involve
joint goals and that are generally confined to a
single turn. They are called Unilateral Actions or
Unilaterals. The specific unilaterals currently
recognized are called Action and Tell.
There are other Unilaterals that are presently
represented by a category, Media Management,
representing communication that is primarily
involved with the medium of communication.
There are also Unilaterals in categories called
Politeness and Acknowledgement. These should be
differentiated further someday.
We noted above that DMT does not make direct
use of the notion of turns in dialogue, and that it
does not require that turns be coherent
monologues. Given the bidding and termination of
games as outlined above, DMT would predict that
some turns would terminate one game and bid
another, thus producing an incoherent fragment.
Although this pattern is not seen in the example
dialogue below, it occurs. Turns are a
presentational convenience, but DMT analysis
sometimes requires other boundaries.3

7 An Example of DMT Analysis:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.931777113636364">
As an example, consider the dialogue excerpt
below. It is part of the actual transcript of the
Apollo 13 mission to the moon, not the movie
script.
The dialogue occurs near the end of the mission,
after the major explosion and after many
emergency measures have been completed. The
spacecraft is traveling toward earth, and the
dialogue is concerned with completing the mission.
The central concerns at this moment are managing
fuel and adjusting the path of the spacecraft. (The
indicated turns are from the original transcript.
Successive turns by the same speaker sometimes
indicate a silent interval.) CMP and CC are NASA
designators for the communicating parties;
“Roger” is jargon for “I heard you.” The
communication channel is continuously open, but
radio quality varies.
The entire text is part of an analysis diagram
below.
The text is an excerpt; the beginning and end of
the dialogue do not have the usual sorts of
greetings, in part because the radio communication
medium remains open even when all parties are
silent. By training and because of the life
threatening situation, everyone communicates
extremely carefully. Extensive use of “Roger” and
multiple use of Clarification Seeking both indicate
this.
All of the technical elements in the analysis have
definitions in the DMT framework. This example
dialogue analysis is based on the definitions, but
they are too numerous to present. The names are
representative, and the definitions are being made
available. The Analysis Summary below shows the
scopes (durations of use) of each instance of use of
a game according to the analysis.
3 It is somewhat problematic to be definite about the
nature of turns. In addition to game opening and
closing, there are overlapping, echoing, failed
interruptions, completions and competition for “the
floor.” All of these create variations on the simple
notion of turns. Presentationally we try to use it only
where there are no subtleties.

Refer to the two-page analysis diagram.
The first four turns are identified as Media
Management, one class of Unilaterals. They
establish which ground control station is calling,
and that the radio quality is adequate. (Turn
numbers are from the original NASA transcript.)
In turn 5, CC is offering information to CMP.
DMT analysis represents this as a bid of the
Information Offering game. It suggests that the
three goals of the Information Offering game, as
specified by the identification of what information
is offered, be adopted for immediate pursuit. The
initiator, who is the speaker of turn 5, would take
up the initiator’s goal and the joint goal. The
responder would take up the responder’s goal and
the joint goal. The goals are not negotiated
individually.
In turn 6, CMP explicitly accepts the bid. Explicit
acceptance is rare. Most often there is explicitly
only an acknowledgement or, for most games,
initial pursuit of the goals of the game. This giving
of information under this bid and acceptance is, in
principle, indefinitely long. Termination can occur
in various ways, the most common being
accomplishment of the goals of the game.
The analysis diagram shows this use of the
Information Offering game as extending from turn
5 through turn 16. Within this scope, in turn 13,
CMP bids the Clarification Seeking game. This is
not quite a typical clarification seeking because the
bidder knows the answer to his question. The turn
is saying, indirectly, that CC has failed to be
explicit about the sign of the number, plus or
minus, and so it requests that CC be specific. In
context, the question is thus humorous. Turn 14 is
Media Management, and so at an analytic level the
bid has not been accepted or rejected. Turn 15
begins to provide the answer, and so accepts the
bid in turn 13. Turn 16 acknowledges
accomplishment of the goals of the Clarification
Seeking game, the inner, most recently started
game, and also the goals of the Information
Offering game. The termination of these games
can be identified by the fact that neither party
continues to pursue goals of the games.
In turn 17 a new episode starts with CMP
requesting an action by CC and the team on the
ground. This is a bid of the Action Seeking game.
Since turn 18 is an Acknowledgement, another
Unilateral, it does not introduce or remove any
goals from being active. Turn 19 accepts the bid,
and as a promise to do the action it also bids
termination of the game. Termination is accepted
in turn 20.
Turn 21 is obscure. It may involve fuel-burning
parts of the spacecraft. Assuming that, it is
background information for some bid of a game in
which there is talk about those parts or about fuel.
Thus turns 21 and 23 together constitute a bid, in
this case of the Information Seeking game. Turns
24 through 28 manage a pause, one that is long
enough that the ground control station identifies
itself again in turn 26. Turns 29 through 31 begin
to provide the information, and turns 33 through 36
complete it and terminate the Information Seeking
game in the normal way.
However, turn 32 attempts to get a clarification.
As such it is a bid of the Clarification Seeking
game. It is ignored, which is equivalent to being
refused.4
In turn 38 CMP again seeks a clarification, which
is a new bid of the Clarification Seeking game. It
is pursued to closure in turn 41.

8 Interpretation:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.86071215">
What have we seen in this analysis?
♦ It shows a diversity of games in use:
Information Offering, Action Seeking,
Clarification Seeking and Information
Seeking.
♦ It illustrates game embedding.
4 Conceptually, being ignored and being refused are
different. But from the point of view of the analyst, and
often of the participant, there is often no discernable
difference.
♦ It shows how Media Management can
arise inside a dialogue, and indicates
how to represent interactions with
extensive confirmation.
♦ It shows a treatment of an ignored
item.
♦ It shows particular Unilaterals in use.
Beyond these, there is a sense in which the analysis
above is not yet complete. The issue is: Does the
analysis show that the dialogue is coherent?
Clearly it does not. Finding a dialogue coherent is
a subjective summary response to many factors,
most of which are not within the scope of DMT.
A better question is: Is the analysis consistent with
a view that the dialogue is coherent? Yes. The
fact that it finds an analytic description for every
utterance of the dialogue supports the conclusion
of coherence. Clearly if some spoken elements
had no DMT status, that would be a basis for
strongly questioning the coherence of the dialogue.
We can do better. The constructs of DMT are
organized around intentions, so we can reasonably
ask: Are the intention structures given in the
analysis consistent with the judgment that the
dialogue is coherent?
Other works have used the concept of Motivational
Coherence. This means, informally, that every
subordinate goal conceivably contributes to
advancing its immediate supergoal, in a
collectively consistent way.

9 Games and Situations Already Examined:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969409542857143">
Based on the analysis of other dialogues, the
following games have been defined: Information
Seeking, Information Offering, Permission
Seeking, Permission Offering, Information Probe,
Socratic Challenge, Action Offering, Action
Seeking, Plan Making, Clarification Seeking,
Conversation Seeking. The names, using terms
such as Seeking and Offering, are generally
oriented to the negotiation at the moment of game
initiation, and to the characterization of the joint
goals of the game. None of these are task oriented
games, although particular tasks use certain games
frequently.
DMT has been developed principally by analysis
of transcripts of natural dialogues. Dialogues from
the following kinds of situations have been used,
generally each situation represented by dialogues
from a single source:
Apollo 13 emergency radio conversations, Medical
interviews, Airline cockpit pre-crash radio, Travel
agents’ conversations, Administrative phone calls,
Computer mediated Computer assistance,
Laboratory conversational tasks, Courtroom
questioning of witnesses, Hostage negotiation,
Mathematics tutoring, Electronics tutoring.
(It is easy to find dialogues that DMT can not
represent. We expect that to account in a
comparable way for natural dialogue as a whole,
several other theories will be needed.)
The set of defined games and their particular
definitions are in a preliminary stage. By the time
of the workshop it may be possible to put game
definitions, numerous raw dialogues with analyses
and analysts’ instructions for dialogue annotation
on the Internet.

there are so many, including schemes under

is needed. In (Traum 2000)5, Traum provides 20
questions that facilitate this organization.

10.2 Depth of analysis:

<bodyText confidence="0.994287857142857">
What aspects of each dialogue are represented?
DMT is attempting to represent only the intention
structure of dialogues. This choice arises from an
interest in accounting for coherence in a broad
diversity of dialogue situations, and an assumption
that coherence is based on intentions. In contrast,
MAP represents additional detail about how map
following is done. For example, given an ordinary
context, DMT might represent the question “Do
you have a stone circle at the bottom?” and also the
question “Towards what?” ((Carletta, Isard et al.
1997) p. 18,19) as bids of the Information Seeking
Game, where MAP would represent them as
QUERY-YN and QUERY-W moves respectively.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.966169">
10.3 Correspondence of terminology:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989302">
The two schemes use the same terms in different
ways, and they have different terms for many
closely comparable items. How do terms line up?
Generally, a forward looking move in MAP is a
bid of a macrogame in DMT. Similarly backward
looking moves in MAP correspond to acceptance
of macrogames in DMT. The Game coding of
MAP identifies moves for which the corresponding
intention persists over more than two turns. Thus
it codes length rather than a distinct kind of
structures. The Transaction coding in MAP is
about topic management. DMT has no
corresponding structures.
Often, and especially in the MAP task, we can
view the backward looking move as implicitly
doing several things: 1) It agrees to interact
pursuing the just-introduced matter. 2) It acts to
advance that interaction, very often to full
satisfaction of the prior move. 3) By completion, it
suggests that no more pursuit of the prior action is
appropriate. In DMT, there are three distinct
representations of these three actions. They
correspond to a) accepting the bid of the game, b)
pursuing the joint intention of the bid, 3) bidding
(by satisfaction) the termination of the game. So
in A: “Are you hungry?” B: “Yes,” DMT
encodes “Yes” as doing all three of these. In both
systems, the participants move on to something
else. In DMT terms this moving on is implicitly
accepting the termination of the game.

10.4 Apparent Complexity:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973441176471">
Corresponding to the four game manipulation acts
of DMT, the Maptask method appears to be
simpler, needing only two. What does the added
complexity do? In DMT the baseline of
representation is that both parties are in control of
the course of the dialogue. It is negotiated
cooperatively. This requires that each party be able
to accept a new topic or set of goals, and each
party must be able to abandon goals. The addition
and dismissal of joint goals are negotiable. Some
situations and some people very seldom reject any
proposal, but it is possible in principle.
In designing the MAP representation, this was
recognized:
“It is also theoretically possible at any
point in the dialogue to refuse to take on
the proposed goal... .Often refusal takes
the form of ignoring the initiation ...
However, it is also possible to make such
refusals explicit... . These cases were
sufficiently rare ...that it was impractical
to include a category for them.” (Carletta,
Isard et al. 1997), p. 21,22.
In the hope of broad coverage the possibilities of
rejection are made explicit in DMT.
So we conclude that although MAP and DMT are
superficially quite different, their approaches to the
Maptask are underlyingly quite similar.
Other analysis methods are oriented to other tasks,
with tutoring being perhaps the most common.
Possibly the comparisons of DMT to other
methods would have many of the same features,
since many of them would compare a non task
specific method with a task specific method.

11 Conclusions:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999681111111111">
As an exercised framework, DMT has an
advantage over its predecessor. It can represent
the entirety of a diverse collection of natural
dialogues. Since it provides all of the previous
mechanisms and more, and it also covers all of the
dialogues that Dialogue Game Theory did. In
addition, DMT gives a formal descriptive place for
the many actions it calls Unilaterals, actions that
are an integral part of dialogue but do not have a

cooperative character.
Because DMT macrogames consist entirely of sets
of intentions, because those goals are accepted and
dismissed together rather than individually, and
because DMT is based on a negotiation metaphor,
DMT provides a basis for describing two-party
coordinated control of dialogue.
The coverage of DMT is broader than task oriented
dialogues, suitably identified. (While it is possible
to label every dialogue as task oriented, which
some researchers have done, that is simply a way
of withdrawing the term from use.) If we define
“task oriented” as requiring the presence of a joint
goal, i.e. a goal that is known and actively pursued
by both parties, then even in the narrow sample of
use of DMT so far, many of the analyzed dialogues
are not task oriented. DMT has also been able to
analyze the entirety of all of the task oriented
dialogues to which it has been applied.
Comparing DMT to another analysis method for
task oriented dialogue, DMT is able to represent
the intention structure and coherence of such
dialogues in a task independent manner.
Representation of negotiation of the course of the
dialogue is explicit in DMT.
As we have seen, DMT is not linked to linguistic
forms, since goals of interaction do not in general
map to any specific words or forms. We could
therefore suggest that DMT, perhaps with some
augmentation of the set of games, would have a
broad multilingual scope of coverage. It would be
worth examining.

Dialogue Macrogame Theory (DMT) is a successor to a theory sometimes called Dialogue Game Theory, developed in the 1970s and 1980s at USC- Information Sciences Institute (ISI). DMT is able to describe substantially more dialogues than its predecessor, and it identifies kinds of mechanisms not included in the predecessor. DMT is a step toward accounting for the coherence of entire dialogues. The major structures in DMT are based on intentions which are imputed to dialogue participants. The focus of this paper is on Macrogames defined. Another class of mechanisms, called Unilaterals, is also described. A DMT analysis is presented. The analyzed dialogue is an excerpt (41 turns) of actual dialogue from the Apollo 13 mission, from the emergency period after the explosion. DMT is then related to another dialogue analysis method (Carletta, Isard et al. 1997). DMT is an exercised framework, meaning that it has been applied to dialogues from a diversity of situations. These include various emergency communications, tutoring, administrative interactions, online human computer help, medical interviews, laboratory conversational tasks, courtroom questioning of witnesses and hostage negotiation. The paper reports work in progress, and also indicates likely courses of further development.</abstract>

This effort has identified a number of deficiencies of the framework, which have led to making a fresh start rather than adjustment. The central constructs in the prior work were called Dialogue Games, a name inspired by terminology of Wittgenstein (Wittgenstein 1973) but with only a distant family resemblance to his usage. Since the end of that work this term has been used in many other ways that are not technically related to the ISI usage.

Global approaches to coherence, ones that attempt to address entire texts or dialogues, are often associated with some notion of genre or tradition, such as Rummelhardt’s story grammars (Rumelhart 1975) or Schank and Abelson’s scripts (Schank and Abelson 1977). (DMT addresses whole dialogues, but without resemblance to those approaches.) There is more recent progress in many aspects of understanding dialogue. A rich array of formal approaches has been built on the Discourse Representation Theory of Kamp and colleagues (Kamp and Reyle 1993) (Traum 1994). Agency theory, along with various vigorous efforts to develop data annotation methods, are also producing insightful views of natural dialogue. Clearly there is no consensus on the nature of coherence in dialogue. Although comparing views is typically difficult, as researchers we always find some views more credible than others. We may be able to make certain alternatives more distinct by an analogy concerning oral dialogue. What is the status of breathing? Do people breathe in dialogue because they believe it will make the dialogue more beneficial? Or is there a duty to breathe</context>

Rather, they (and all of the goals of the framework) have places for unspecified arguments, such as the particular information above. DMT does not assume that the dialogue is task oriented; if it is, the goals of a particular use of a game may be task goals, and a particular goal can appear in more than one position in a game use. All of the individual participants’ goals that are used in DMT games have the following attributes in the (Mann 2001) framework: partialness, priorness, tacitness, immediacy , interactionconfiguring, intended to be recognized, structuredness, complementarity, conventionality. The joint goals have the additional attribute of jointness, and they lack complementarity. The course of a dialogue between peers is generally under the control of both participants. They coordinate and jointly control by means of particular kinds of actions. DMT uses a negotiation metaphor to describe this. A game is bid by the initiator, and the responder accepts or refuses the bid. These actions are almost always implicit, but certai</context>

Hawes defends his views against this idea (Hawes 1983). Some studies of coherence in dialogue assume that people pursue a tacit goal of being coherent, in addition to any other goals, when they interact. It is a benefit which they seek. (Hopper attributes this orientation to interpreters of language, but not producers (Hopper 1983).) Others see coherence as an obligation that is attached to interaction. It is an added duty. (Sanders sees this view as widely accepted, and defends his views against it (Sanders 1983).) Some studies equate coherence with propositional consistency, see (Goldberg 1983) for citations. Others see coherence as a kind of summary impression that is a side effect of understanding an interaction, an understanding that is enabled by the processes that ordinarily govern interaction (Sanders 1983). The (Craig and Tracy 1983) book incorporates an admirable attempt to make the various approaches comparable.

In this book, and in the wider literature as well, the distinction between coherence and cohesion is often not made. Studies of coherence are often really about abstract cohesive devices, in the sense of (Halliday and Hasan 1976). Some studies (Ellis 1983; Goldberg 1983) assume that coherence is produced by design, by appropriate use of cohesive devices. In some studies coherence is equated to topic continuity or to the appropriate use of topic shifting devices (Crow 1983; Sigman 1983). In others it is seen as conformity to expressive rules. Grice is often interpreted as believing that conversational coherence is based on rule (or maxim) following (Grice 1975). Still others see coherence as an identifiable outcome of rule governed (social or linguistic) behavior (Goldberg 1 Sometimes DMT structures can be applied to interactions that have more than two participants. Even so, dialogue macrogame theory would have to be significantly augmented in order to become a sound representation scheme for multiparty interaction.

The central constructs in the prior work were called Dialogue Games, a name inspired by terminology of Wittgenstein (Wittgenstein 1973) but with only a distant family resemblance to his usage. Since the end of that work this term has been used in many other ways that are not technically related to the ISI usage. In addition, the terms dialogue act, conversational act, and conversational game are in wide use (Carlson 1983) (Kreutel and Matheson 2001) (Traum 1994; Poesio and Traum 1998; Traum 1999) . To simply resume using the old terminology now would invite confusion and misunderstanding. So this paper introduces a new term, Dialogue Macrogame, which represents some structures that resemble the dialogue games of the predecessor model. In this paper, Dialogue Macrogame may be abbreviated to dialogue game or even game. The term dialogue represents two party immediate interaction.1 Studies of dialogue from various points of view are numerous. There are dozens of technical fields with the word communication in their names (Craig 1999). Many of them study dialogue. There are structural vie</context>

One of the well known dialogue analysis schemes,6 used in the Edinburgh Maptask, is described in (Carletta, Isard et al. 1997) (Carletta, Isard et al. 1996) How does MAP compare to DMT? Here we identify four aspects, focusing on apparent complexity: 1. Attempted coverage 2. Depth of analysis 3. Correspondence of terminology 4. Apparent Complexity 10.1 Attempted coverage: For what range of dialogue situations is analysis attempted? The MAP method is explicitly oriented to map following dialogue. This design choice 5 Also (Traum 1999). 6 Here abbreviated MAP. impacts many elements of map following. DMT attempts broad coverage; as indicated above, substantial coverage beyond map following dialogue has been demonstrated at the exercise level. 10.2 Depth of analysis: What aspects of each dialogue are represented? DMT is attempting to represent only the intention structure of dialogues. This choice arises from an interest in accounting for coherence in a broad diversity of dialogue situations, and an assumption that coherence is based on intentions. In contrast, MAP represents additional detail about how map following is done.</context>

It provides a way of introducing joint goals into a dialogue, and, equally important, a way of dismissing goals from a dialogue, all under the shared control of both participants. The view of intentions here follows (Mann 2001), which identified a set of attributes of intentions that can be found in the literature of intentions in language. That view makes use of (Bratman 1987; Clark 1996; Gibbs 1999). The view of joint intentions, and of joint actions where they occur, generally follows Clark, who follows (Tuomela 2000). 5 Dialogue Macrogames: The major construct of Dialogue Macrogame Theory is, of` course, the dialogue macrogame. A (dialogue macro)game is defined as a set of three goals: 1. A goal of the initiator 2. A goal of the responder 3. A joint goal A dialogue macrogame is a convention, loosely comparable to a lexical item or a grammatical pattern. DMT expects that people will hold hierarchic goal structures, in general but especially for embedded uses of games. However, these three goals are not in hierarchic configuration. When a game is used, the goal of the initiator and the joint goal will be in</context>
