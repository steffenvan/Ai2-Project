On behalf of the Programme Committee, we are pleased to present the proceedings of
the Student Research Workshop held at the Eleventh Conference of the European Chapter
of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Following the tradition of providing a
forum for student researchers and the success of the previous workshops held in Bergen
(1999), Toulouse (2001) and Budapest (2003), a panel of senior researchers will take part
in the presentation of the papers, providing detailed comments on the work of the authors.
The Student Workshop will run as three parallel sessions, during which 9 papers will be
presented. These high standard papers were carefully chosen from a total of 33 submissions
coming from about 15 countries.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank the many people that have contributed
in various ways to the success of the Student Workshop: the members of the Programme
Committee for their evaluation of the submissions and for taking the time to provide useful
detailed comments and suggestions for the improvement of papers; the panelists for pro-
viding detailed feedback directly; and the students for their hard work in preparing their
submissions.
We are also very grateful to the EACL for providing sponsorship for students who
would otherwise be unable to attend the workshop and present their work. And finally,
thanks to those who have given us advice and assistance in planning this workshop (espe-
cially Chris Callison-Burch, Anette Frank, Alberto Lavelli, Diana McCarthy, Gertjan van
Noord and Stephen Wan).
We hope you enjoy the Student Research Workshop.
