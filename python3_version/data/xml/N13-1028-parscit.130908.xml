Language variations are generally known to
have a severe impact on the performance of
Human Language Technology Systems. In or-
der to predict or improve system performance,
a thorough investigation into these variations,
similarities and dissimilarities, is required.
Distance measures have been used in several
applications of speech processing to analyze
different varying speech attributes. However,
not much work has been done on language dis-
tance measures, and even less work has been
done involving South African languages. This
study explores two methods for measuring the
linguistic distance of six South African lan-
guages. It concerns a text based method, (the
Levenshtein Distance), and an acoustic ap-
proach using extracted mean pitch values. The
Levenshtein distance uses parallel word tran-
scriptions from all six languages with as little
as 144 words, whereas the pitch method is
text-independent and compares mean language
pitch differences. Cluster analysis resulting
from the distance matrices from both methods
correlates closely with human perceptual dis-
tances and existing literature about the six lan-
guages.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911675">
The development of objective metrics to assess the
distances between different languages is of great
theoretical and practical importance. Currently,
subjective measures have generally been employed
to assess the degree of similarity or dissimilarity
between different languages (Gooskens &amp;
Heeringa, 2004; Van-Bezooijen &amp; Heeringa, 2006;
Van-Hout &amp; Münstermann, 1981), and those sub-
jective decisions are, for example, the basis for
classifying separate languages, and certain groups
of language variants as dialects of one another. It is
well known that languages are complex; they differ
in vocabulary, grammar, writing format, syntax
and many other characteristics. This presents levels
of difficulty in the construction of objective com-
parative measures between languages. Even if one
intuitively knows, for example, that English is
closer to French than it is to Chinese, what are the
objective factors that allow one to assess the levels
of distance?
This bears substantial similarities to the analo-
gous questions that have been asked about the rela-
tionships between different species in the science
of cladistics. As in cladistics, the most satisfactory
answer would be a direct measure of the amount of
time that has elapsed since the languages’ first split
from their most recent common ancestor. Also, as
in cladistics, it is hard to measure this from the
available evidence, and various approximate
measures have to be employed instead. In the bio-
logical case, recent decades have seen tremendous
improvements in the accuracy of biological meas-
urements as it has become possible to measure dif-
ferences between DNA sequences. In linguistics,
the analogue of DNA measurements is historical
information on the evolution of languages, and the
more easily measured—though indirect measure-
ments (akin to the biological phenotype)—are ei-
ther the textual or acoustic representations of the
languages in question.

In the current article, we focus on language dis-
tance measures derived from both text and acoustic
formats; we apply two different techniques, name-
ly Levenshtein distance between orthographic
word transcriptions, and distances between lan-
guage pitch means in order to obtain measures of
dissimilarity amongst a set of languages. These
methods are used to obtain language groupings
which are represented graphically using multidi-
mensional scaling and dendrograms—two standard
statistical techniques. This allows us to visualize
and assess the methods relative to known linguistic
facts in order to judge their relative
reliability(Zulu, Botha, &amp; Barnard, 2008).
Our evaluation is based on six of the eleven
official languages of South Africa.1 The eleven
official languages fall into two distinct groups,
namely the Germanic group (represented by Eng-
lish and Afrikaans) and the South African Bantu
languages, which belong to the South Eastern Ban-
tu group. The South African Bantu languages can
further be classified in terms of different sub-
groupings: Nguni (consisting of Zulu, Xhosa, Nde-
bele and Swati), Sotho (consisting of Southern So-
tho, Northern Sotho and Tswana), and a pair that
falls outside these sub-families (Tsonga and Ven-
da). The six languages chosen for our evaluation
are English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, Northern So-
tho (also known as Sepedi) and Tswana, which
equally represent the three groups; Germanic,
Nguni and Sotho.
We believe that an understanding of these lan-
guage distances is not only of inherent interest, but
also of great practical importance. For purposes
such as language learning, the selection of target
languages for various resources and the develop-
ment of Human Language Technologies, reliable
knowledge of language distances would be of great
value. Consider, for example, the common situa-
tion of an organization that wishes to publish in-
formation relevant to all languages in a particular
multi-lingual community, but has insufficient fund-
ing to do so. Such an organization can be guided
by knowledge of language distances and mutual
intelligibility between languages to make an ap-
propriate choice of publication languages.
The following sections describe the Levenshtein
distance and pitch characteristics in detail. There-

2 Theoretical Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999410821428571">
Orthographic transcriptions are one of the most
basic types of annotation used for speech transcrip-
tion, and are particularly important in most fields
of research concerned with spoken language. The
orthography of a language refers to the set symbols
used to write a language and includes its writing
system. English, for example, has an alphabet of
26 letters which includes both consonants and
vowels. However, each English letter may repre-
sent more than one phoneme, and each phoneme
may be represented by more than one letter. In the
current research, we investigate the use of Le-
venshtein distance on orthographic transcriptions
for the assessment of language similarities.
On the other hand, speech has been and still
very much is the most natural form of communica-
tion. Prosodic characteristics such as rhythm, stress
and intonation in speech convey important infor-
mation regarding the identity of a spoken language.
Results of perception studies on spoken language
identification confirm that prosodic information,
specifically pitch and intensity—which represent
intonation and stress respectively—are useful for
language identification (Kometsu, Mori, Arai, &amp;
Murahara, 2001; Mori et al., 1999). This paper pre-
sents a preliminary investigation of pitch and its
role in determining acoustic based language dis-
tances.

<bodyText confidence="0.999984">
There are several ways in which phoneticians have
tried to measure the distance between two linguis-
tic entities, most of which are based on the descrip-
tion of sounds via various representations. This
section introduces the Levenshtein Distance Meas-
ure, one of the more popular sequence-based dis-
tance measures. In 1995 Kessler introduced the use
of the Levenshtein Distance as a tool for measuring
linguistic distances between dialects (Kessler,
1995). The basic idea behind the Levenshtein Dis-
tance is to imagine that one is rewriting or trans-
forming one string into another. Kessler
successfully applied the Levenshtein Distance

measure to the comparison of Irish dialects. In his
work, the strings were transcriptions of word pro-
nunciations. In general, rewriting is effected by
basic operations, each of which is associated with a
cost, as illustrated in Table 1 in the transformation
of the string “mošemane” to the string “umfana”,
which are both orthographic translations of the
word boy in Northern Sotho and Zulu respectively.

The Levenshtein Distance between two strings can
be defined as the least costly sum of costs needed
to transform one string into another. In Table 1, the
transformations shown are associated with costs
derived from operations performed on the strings.
The operations used are: (i) the deletion of a single
symbol, (ii) the insertion of a single symbol, and
(iii) the substitution of one symbol for another
(Kruskal, 1999). The edit distance method was also
taken up by (Nerbonne et al., 1996) who applied it
to Dutch dialects. Whereas Kruskal (1999) and
Nerbonne et al. (1996) applied this method to pho-
netic transcriptions in which the symbols repre-
sented sounds, here the symbols were associated
with alphabetic letters.
Similarly, Gooskens and Heeringa (2004) cal-
culated Levenshtein Distances between 15 Norwe-
gian dialects and compared them to the distances
as perceived by Norwegian listeners. This compar-
ison showed a high correlation between the Le-
venshtein distances and the perceptual distances.

2.2 Language pitch distance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970121212121">
Speech is primarily intended to convey some mes-
sage through a sequence of legal sound units in a
language. However, speech cannot merely be char-
acterized as a sequence of sound units. There are
some characteristics that lend naturalness to
speech, such as the variation of pitch, which pro-
vides some recognizable melodic properties to
spoken language. This controlled modulation of
pitch is referred to as intonation. The sound units
are shortened or lengthened in accordance to some
underlying pattern giving rhythmic properties to
speech. The information attained from these
rhythmic patterns increases the intelligibility of
spoken languages, enabling the listener to segment
continuous speech into phrases and words with
ease (Shriberg, Stolcke, Hakkani-Tur, &amp; Tur,
2000). The characteristics that make us perceive
this and other information such as stress, accent
and emotion are collectively referred to as prosody.
Comparisons have shown that languages differ
greatly in their prosodic features (Hirst &amp; Cristo,
1998), therefore providing a basis for objective
comparison between languages. Further, pitch is a
perceptual attribute of sound, the physical correlate
of which is fundamental frequency (F0), which rep-
resents vibration of the vocal folds.
This paper extracts pitch contours from six dif-
ferent languages, and uses the mean fundamental
frequency values for each language to calculate the
differences in pitch amongst them. From this we
derive a distance matrix of F0 dissimilarities (dif-
ferences) which in turn is used to obtain language
groupings.

2.3 Language Clustering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925272727273">
In using the Levenshtein Distance measure, the
distance between two languages is equal to the av-
erage of a sample of Levenshtein Distances of cor-
responding word pairs. With pitch, the distance
between two languages is merely the difference
between the mean fundamental frequencies of the
two languages. When we have n languages, then
these distances are calculated for each possible pair
of languages. For n languages n x n distances can
be calculated. The corresponding distances are ar-
ranged in an n x n matrix. The distance of each
language with respect to itself is found in the dis-
tance matrix on the diagonal from the upper left to
the lower right. As this is a dissimilarity matrix,
these values are always zero and therefore give no
real information, so that only n x (n - 1) distances
are relevant. Furthermore, both the Levenshtein
and pitch distances are symmetric, implying that
the distance between language X and Y is equal to
the distance between language Y and X. Therefore,
the distance matrix is symmetric. We need to use
only one half which contains (n x (n - 1))/2 dis-

tances. Given the distance matrix, groups of larger
sizes are investigated. Hierarchical clustering
methods are employed to classify the languages
into related language groups using the distance
matrix.
Data clustering is a common technique for sta-
tistical data analysis, which is used in many fields
including machine learning, bioinformatics, image
analysis, data mining and pattern recognition.
Clustering is the classification of similar objects
into different groups, or more precisely, the parti-
tioning of a data set into subsets, so that the data in
each subset share some common trait according to
a defined distance measure. The result of this
grouping is usually illustrated as a dendrogram; a
tree diagram used to illustrate the arrangement of
the groups produced by a clustering algorithm
(Heeringa &amp; Gooskens, 2003), whereas multidi-
mensional scaling adds to illustrate the visualiza-
tion of the language proximities in a 2-dimensional
space.

This evaluation aims to present language groups of
the six chosen languages of South Africa generated
from dissimilarity matrices of the languages. These
matrices are the results of Levenshtein distance
and average pitch distance measurements. The dia-
grams provide visual representations of the pattern
of similarities and dissimilarities between the lan-
guages.
3.1 Language grouping using Levenshtein
distance
Levenshtein distances were calculated using exist-
ing parallel orthographic word transcriptions of
144 words from each of the six languages. The
data was manually collected from various multilin-
gual dictionaries and online resources. Initially,
200 common English words, mostly common
nouns easily translated into the other five lan-
guages, were chosen. From this set, those words
having unique translations into each of the other
five languages were selected, resulting in 144
words that were used in the evaluations. Examples
of four word translations in all six languages are
shown in Table 2.

The confusion matrices provide a clear indication
of the ways the languages group into families.
These relationships can be represented visually
using graphical techniques. Multidimensional scal-
ing (MDS) is a technique used in data visualization
for exploring the properties of data in high-
dimensional spaces. The algorithm uses a matrix of
dissimilarities between items and then assigns each
item a location in a low dimensional space to
match those distances as closely as possible. The
study used the dissimilarity matrix to serve as a
measure between languages, and used the statisti-
cal package XLSTAT (XLSTAT, 2012). The dis-
similarity matrix was input into the
multidimensional scaling algorithm which mapped
the language dissimilarities in a 2-dimensional
space.

Figure 1 shows the mapping that was created
using the dissimilarity matrix in Table 3; we can
see that the languages from the same subfamilies
group together. The mapping using just 144 words
shows a definite grouping of the families. In the
mapping the Sotho languages are more closely re-
lated internally than both the Nguni and Germanic
languages as expected — from the historical record
(Heine &amp; Nurse, 2000), it is clear that a tighter in-
ternal grouping of the Sotho and Nguni languages
is accurate.

3.2 Pitch Extraction and language grouping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971142857143">
The extraction of pitch contours was carried out
with Praat (Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2011), a free
scientific software program for the analysis of
speech and phonetics. The use of Praat is advanta-
geous in that it is fairly easy to use, has high pro-
cessing speed, is accurate and allows scripting,
which is very useful in processing large numbers
of files (in our case, speech recordings).
A Praat script was written specifying two main
parameters; the expected minimum and maximum
pitch values in Hertz, which were selected to be
75Hz and 600Hz respectively. The extraction of
pitch contours is based on the detection of perio-
dicities. The Praat command To PointProcess (pe-
riodic, peaks)... analyses the selected speech file
and creates a sequence of points in time. The
acoustic periodicity detection is performed on the
basis of an accurate short-term analysis of the fun-
damental frequency and the harmonics-to-noise
ratio working in the autocorrelation domain as de-
scribed by Boersma (Boersma, 1993). This method
was able to achieve more accurate and noise-
resistant results when compared to combs or
cepstrum based methods (Pokorny, 2011). The ex-
tracted acoustic periodicity contour is interpreted
as being the frequency of an underlying sequence
of glottal closures in vocal fold vibrations. For

found and their points in time are saved, forming
the pitch contour for that particular speech file
(Pokorny, 2011). Pitch contours were extracted
from 5000 speech files per language for each of the
six languages, with each language having approx-
imately 200 different speakers (25 recordings per
speaker) with a relatively equal distribution of
males and females, all aged between 18 and 65
years.
The extracted pitch frequency points for all
5000 files were collected and placed in a single
array for each language. Each array represents the
pitch distribution for the specific language, and the
mean frequency for each language was used to
model the respective language. The dissimilarity
matrix was then derived from the differences of
these means for each pair of languages. Figure 3
illustrates the distribution of pitch frequencies for
the selected languages. It clearly shows the relative
pitch content variations of the different languages,
which is key to determining the dissimilarity
amongst the languages. Also of note in Figure 3

cies—in the range of 85 to 180Hz for males and

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986136363637">
Both dissimilarity matrices resulting from the text-
based Levenshtein Distance and the acoustic mean
pitch frequency differences can effectively be
combined with multidimensional scaling and den-
drograms to epitomize language relationships.
Both methods reflect the known family relation-
ships between the languages being studied. The
main conclusion of this research is therefore that
statistical methods, used with both text-based and
acoustic-based methods and data, are able to pro-
vide useful objective measures of language similar-
ities or dissimilarities. It is clear that these methods
can be refined further using other inputs such as
phonetic transcriptions or further acoustic meas-
urements; such refinements are likely to be im-
portant when, for example, fine distinctions
between dialects are required.
However, each approach has its advantages and
disadvantages. Levenshtein Distance measures do
not require much data to perform a reasonable
classification of the data. With as few as 50 words
per language, reasonable classification is possible.
Also, the process of generating the distance matrix
is not computationally taxing. However, this meth-
od is less discriminating in assessing languages
with different writing styles, for example Chinese
and English. Using pitch bares the advantage of
using language data in its most natural form, but
has its disadvantages in being computationally tax-
ing when dealing with large amounts of data—
which is generally required in order to produce
good results.
It would be most interesting to see whether
closer agreement between these methods can be
achieved by measuring Levenshtein Distances be-
tween larger text collections—perhaps even paral-
lel corpora rather than translations of word lists.
Comparing these distance measures with measures
derived from different acoustic parameters, or a
combination of parameters, is another pressing
concern. Finally, it would be valuable to compare
various distance measures against other criteria for
language similarity (e.g. historical separation or
mutual intelligibility) in a rigorous fashion.

<abstract confidence="0.994831555555555">Language variations are generally known to have a severe impact on the performance of Human Language Technology Systems. In order to predict or improve system performance, a thorough investigation into these variations, similarities and dissimilarities, is required. Distance measures have been used in several applications of speech processing to analyze different varying speech attributes. However, not much work has been done on language distance measures, and even less work has been done involving South African languages. This study explores two methods for measuring the linguistic distance of six South African languages. It concerns a text based method, (the Levenshtein Distance), and an acoustic approach using extracted mean pitch values. The Levenshtein distance uses parallel word transcriptions from all six languages with as little as 144 words, whereas the pitch method is text-independent and compares mean language pitch differences. Cluster analysis resulting from the distance matrices from both methods correlates closely with human perceptual distances and existing literature about the six languages.</abstract>

The operations used are: (i) the deletion of a single symbol, (ii) the insertion of a single symbol, and (iii) the substitution of one symbol for another (Kruskal, 1999). The edit distance method was also taken up by (Nerbonne et al., 1996) who applied it to Dutch dialects. Whereas Kruskal (1999) and Nerbonne et al. (1996) applied this method to phonetic transcriptions in which the symbols represented sounds, here the symbols were associated with alphabetic letters. Similarly, Gooskens and Heeringa (2004) calculated Levenshtein Distances between 15 Norwegian dialects and compared them to the distances as perceived by Norwegian listeners. This comparison showed a high correlation between the Levenshtein distances and the perceptual distances. 2.2 Language pitch distance Speech is primarily intended to convey some message through a sequence of legal sound units in a language. However, speech cannot merely be characterized as a sequence of sound units. There are some characteristics that lend naturalness to speech, such as the variation of pitch, which provides some recognizable melodic propertie</context>

Cluster analysis resulting from the distance matrices from both methods correlates closely with human perceptual distances and existing literature about the six languages. 1 Introduction The development of objective metrics to assess the distances between different languages is of great theoretical and practical importance. Currently, subjective measures have generally been employed to assess the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between different languages (Gooskens &amp; Heeringa, 2004; Van-Bezooijen &amp; Heeringa, 2006; Van-Hout &amp; Münstermann, 1981), and those subjective decisions are, for example, the basis for classifying separate languages, and certain groups of language variants as dialects of one another. It is well known that languages are complex; they differ in vocabulary, grammar, writing format, syntax and many other characteristics. This presents levels of difficulty in the construction of objective comparative measures between languages. Even if one intuitively knows, for example, that English is closer to French than it is to Chinese, what are the objective facto</context>

Clustering is the classification of similar objects into different groups, or more precisely, the partitioning of a data set into subsets, so that the data in each subset share some common trait according to a defined distance measure. The result of this grouping is usually illustrated as a dendrogram; a tree diagram used to illustrate the arrangement of the groups produced by a clustering algorithm (Heeringa &amp; Gooskens, 2003), whereas multidimensional scaling adds to illustrate the visualization of the language proximities in a 2-dimensional space. 3 Evaluation This evaluation aims to present language groups of the six chosen languages of South Africa generated from dissimilarity matrices of the languages. These matrices are the results of Levenshtein distance and average pitch distance measurements.

The dissimilarity matrix was input into the multidimensional scaling algorithm which mapped the language dissimilarities in a 2-dimensional space. 283 Figure 1 shows the mapping that was created using the dissimilarity matrix in Table 3; we can see that the languages from the same subfamilies group together. The mapping using just 144 words shows a definite grouping of the families. In the mapping the Sotho languages are more closely related internally than both the Nguni and Germanic languages as expected — from the historical record (Heine &amp; Nurse, 2000), it is clear that a tighter internal grouping of the Sotho and Nguni languages is accurate.

The sound units are shortened or lengthened in accordance to some underlying pattern giving rhythmic properties to speech. The information attained from these rhythmic patterns increases the intelligibility of spoken languages, enabling the listener to segment continuous speech into phrases and words with ease (Shriberg, Stolcke, Hakkani-Tur, &amp; Tur, 2000). The characteristics that make us perceive this and other information such as stress, accent and emotion are collectively referred to as prosody. Comparisons have shown that languages differ greatly in their prosodic features (Hirst &amp; Cristo, 1998), therefore providing a basis for objective comparison between languages. Further, pitch is a perceptual attribute of sound, the physical correlate of which is fundamental frequency (F0), which represents vibration of the vocal folds. This paper extracts pitch contours from six different languages, and uses the mean fundamental frequency values for each language to calculate the differences in pitch amongst them. From this we derive a distance matrix of F0 dissimilarities (differences) which in turn is used to obtain language groupings. 2.3 Language Clustering In using the Levenshtein Distance</context>

This section introduces the Levenshtein Distance Measure, one of the more popular sequence-based distance measures. In 1995 Kessler introduced the use of the Levenshtein Distance as a tool for measuring linguistic distances between dialects (Kessler, 1995). The basic idea behind the Levenshtein Distance is to imagine that one is rewriting or transforming one string into another. Kessler successfully applied the Levenshtein Distance 281 measure to the comparison of Irish dialects. In his work, the strings were transcriptions of word pronunciations. In general, rewriting is effected by basic operations, each of which is associated with a cost, as illustrated in Table 1 in the transformation of the string “mošemane” to the string “umfana”, which are both orthographic translations of the word boy in Northern Sotho and Zulu respectively.

There are some characteristics that lend naturalness to speech, such as the variation of pitch, which provides some recognizable melodic properties to spoken language. This controlled modulation of pitch is referred to as intonation. The sound units are shortened or lengthened in accordance to some underlying pattern giving rhythmic properties to speech. The information attained from these rhythmic patterns increases the intelligibility of spoken languages, enabling the listener to segment continuous speech into phrases and words with ease (Shriberg, Stolcke, Hakkani-Tur, &amp; Tur, 2000). The characteristics that make us perceive this and other information such as stress, accent and emotion are collectively referred to as prosody. Comparisons have shown that languages differ greatly in their prosodic features (Hirst &amp; Cristo, 1998), therefore providing a basis for objective comparison between languages. Further, pitch is a perceptual attribute of sound, the physical correlate of which is fundamental frequency (F0), which represents vibration of the vocal folds. This paper extracts pitch contours from six different languages, and uses the mean fundamental frequency values for</context>

These relationships can be represented visually using graphical techniques. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a technique used in data visualization for exploring the properties of data in highdimensional spaces. The algorithm uses a matrix of dissimilarities between items and then assigns each item a location in a low dimensional space to match those distances as closely as possible. The study used the dissimilarity matrix to serve as a measure between languages, and used the statistical package XLSTAT (XLSTAT, 2012). The dissimilarity matrix was input into the multidimensional scaling algorithm which mapped the language dissimilarities in a 2-dimensional space. 283 Figure 1 shows the mapping that was created using the dissimilarity matrix in Table 3; we can see that the languages from the same subfamilies group together. The mapping using just 144 words shows a definite grouping of the families. In the mapping the Sotho languages are more closely related internally than both the Nguni and Germanic languages as expected — from the historical record (Heine &amp; Nurse, 2000), it is clear that a tighter interna</context>

These methods are used to obtain language groupings which are represented graphically using multidimensional scaling and dendrograms—two standard statistical techniques. This allows us to visualize and assess the methods relative to known linguistic facts in order to judge their relative reliability(Zulu, Botha, &amp; Barnard, 2008). Our evaluation is based on six of the eleven official languages of South Africa.1 The eleven official languages fall into two distinct groups, namely the Germanic group (represented by English and Afrikaans) and the South African Bantu languages, which belong to the South Eastern Bantu group. The South African Bantu languages can further be classified in terms of different subgroupings: Nguni (consisting of Zulu, Xhosa, Ndebele and Swati), Sotho (consisting of Southern Sotho, Northern Sotho and Tswana), and a pair that falls outside these sub-families (Tsonga and Venda).
