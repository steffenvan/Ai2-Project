Welcome to the 1 st SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue. SIGdial is the ACL
Special Interest Group in Discourse and Dialogue which was formed in late 1997. With the
increasing importance of our area of research there has been a perceived need in the SIGdial
Community for a regular workshop spanning the entire field of discourse and dialogue. While
there has been a lot of activity in the field, and fairly frequent workshops on various sub-
topics, there has not been a regular place for presentation of discourse and dialogue research
to receive attention from the larger SIGdial community. This workshop is intended to be the
first in a regular series which serves to bring the SIGdial community together.
Topics for this workshop include formal, corpus-based, implementational and analytical work
on discourse and dialogue, with a focus on the following three themes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.954008875">
• Dialogue Systems, i.e. models, methods, strategies, tools and architectures related to
spoken, multi-modal, and text/web based dialogue systems.
• Corpora and Corpus Tools, i.e. support for corpus-based work on discourse and dialogue.
• Pragmatic and/or Semantic Modelling, i.e. the pragmatics and/or semantics of discourse
and dialogue (beyond a single sentence), and specific aspects of discourse and dialogue
structure.
In addition to these three themes, this year&apos;s workshop includes a special-theme session on
• Principles for Evaluation of Dialogue Systems.

We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee - Niels Ole Bemsen, Phil
Cohen, Morena Danieli, Yasuharu Den, Barbara Di Eugenio, Paul Heisterkamp, Lynette
Hirschman, Beth Ann Hockey, Kristiina Jokinen, Pamela Jordan, Hans Kamp, Ian Lewin,
Daniel Marcu, Katashi Nagao, Laurent Romary, Rernko Scha, Akira Shimazu, Candace
Sidner, Mark Steedman, Michael Strube, Jan van Kuppevelt, and Marilyn Walker — for their
work. We would also like to thank our invited speaker, Jens Allwood, for his contribution to
the Workshop Program. We are sure that these efforts together with the active participation of
workshop attendees will make the workshop a stimulating and constructive event for
interchange of research results, ideas and visions for future work.
