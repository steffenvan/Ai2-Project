Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999478681818182">
Pakistan has a population of 140 million
speaking more than 56 different languages.
Urdu is the lingua franca of these people, as
many speak Urdu as a second language, also
the national language of Pakistan. Being a
developing population, Pakistani people need
access to information. Most of the
information over the ICT infrastructure is only
available in English and only 5-10% of these
people are familiar with English. Therefore,
Government of Pakistan has embarked on a
project which will generate software to
automatically translate the information
available in English to Urdu. The project will
also be able to convert Urdu text to speech to
extend this information to the illiterate
population as well. This paper overviews the
overall architecture of the project and provides
briefs on the three components of this project,
namely Urdu Lexicon, English to Urdu
Machine Translation System and Urdu Text to
Speech System.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975746741935484">
In todayâ€™s information age it is critical to provide
access to information to people for their
development. One precursor to this access is
availability of information in the native languages.
Due to limitations in technology, it has not been
possible to generate information in many
languages of the world. However, with recent
advances in internationalization and localization
technology, many languages are not enabled.
However, as this is recent development, the
published content in these languages is still
limited, and far lags behind the content available
for English, Spanish and some other languages
spoken in developed countries. Realizing this gap
in content and the need to provide access to
information to its citizens, Government of Pakistan
has recently launched Urdu Localization Project1.
1 Urdu Localization Project is a three-year initiative
being undertaken by Center for Research in Urdu
Language Processing (www.crulp.org) and is funded
This project will enable translation and access of
English content to literate and illiterate Urdu
speakers.
Urdu Localization Project aims to provide access
to existing English language content to Urdu
language speakers. The project has three
components: Urdu Computational Lexicon,
English-to-Urdu Machine Translation System,
Urdu Text-to-Speech system. This paper briefly
describes the architecture and work achieved to-
date for different systems within ULP.

2 ULP Architecture
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97449124137931">
As indicated, ULP comprises of three largely
independent systems: Lexicon, MT and TTS,
though these components may also be integrated to
develop a written and oral interface to information.
The project has three architectural layers. At the
base are the core data and engines for Lexicon, MT
and TTS. The middle layer provides public
programming interfaces to these engines (APIs) so
that they may be integrated with end-user
applications at the top layer or used by third-party
applications. Both the engine and API layer
components are being developed in standard
C/C++ to enable them to compile on all platforms
(e.g. Microsoft, Linux, Unix). The user-end/top
layer has to be technology centric and is currently
being enabled in Microsoft platform. The lexicon
will be given a web interface for user access. In
addition, plug-ins for internet and email clients will
be developed for MT and TTS to enable end-users
to translate and re-display English websites in
Urdu and also enable them to convert the translated
Urdu text to speech. This is shown in Figure 1
below. In the figure the layers and systems are
demarcated (horizontally and vertically
respectively). The figure also shows that MT and
TTS may be using the Lexicon through the APIs
for getting appropriate data.

These three systems are discussed briefly below.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.973696">
2.1 Urdu Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820181818182">
Urdu Computational Lexicon being designed
would be holding more than 25 dimensions of a
single headword. The first task to date has been to
determine this hierarchical storage structure. The
structure required for end-user has been finalized.
However, requirements for computational
applications, e.g. MT, are still being finalized.
This was perhaps one of the most challenging tasks
as there are currently no standards which exist,
although some guidelines are available. In
addition, Urdu also had some additional
requirements (e.g. multiple plural forms,
depending on whether the word is derived from
Arabic or Sanskrit). Entries of more than thirty
thousand headwords and complete entry of about a
thousand headwords along with specification of at
least 15 entries has already been done. Currently
more content is being generated. In addition, work
is under progress to define the physical structure of
the lexicon (e.g. storage and retrieval models).
The prototype showing this application is also
available in Microsoft platform.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998401">
2.2 English-Urdu Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999709533333333">
Work is under progress to develop English to
Urdu MT engine. The translation is based on LFG
formalism and is developing grammars, lexica and
the parsing/mapping/generation engine for LFG.
Mapping and Generation prototypes have already
been developed and are integrated with a freely
available LFG parser for internal testing. In
addition sample grammars for English, Urdu and
English-Urdu mapping have also been written.
The prototype covers about 10 percent of
grammatical rules and already translates within the
limited vocabulary of the engine. The work is
being extended to write the parser and rewrite
mapper and generator and to develop English,
Urdu and English Urdu grammars and lexica.

2.3 Urdu Text to Speech System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973210526316">
The Urdu TTS is divided into two main part, the
Urdu Natural Language Processor and Urdu
Speech Synthesizer. The work on NLP is
completed (except the intonational module, on
which preliminary work has been completed). The
NLP processor inputs Urdu Unicode text and
output narrow phonetic transcription with syllable
and stress markers. The NLP processor is
integrated with Festival speech synthesis system
(though by-passes its NLP module). A vocabulary
of about 500 words is already defined at the
diphones have been created. Prototype application
is already developed which synthesized these
single words. Work is currently in progress to
define Urdu intonational and durational model. In
addition, work is also under progress to extend the
vocabulary and functionality to synthesize
complete sentences. The functional prototype
works on both Linux an Microsoft platforms.

3 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982157894737">
Most of the work being done in the project is
novel. Urdu language is not very well defined for
use with computers. Script, speech and language
aspects of Urdu are being studied, documented and
implemented in this project. The project is also
testing the work which has been matured on
western languages but only being recently exposed
to other languages, e.g. the lexical
recommendations by ISLE, LFG framework, use
of LFG for MT, speech modeling of Urdu (both
spectral and temporal) and more. Non-functional
issues including performance are also being
negotiated. Pre-compiled lexica, user-centric pre-
stored performance-enhancing profiles and
frequency lists, etc. are part of the architectural
tasks being addressed. Though only initial work
has been done, this work in itself is substantial, and
has raised many questions which will be answered
as the project progresses.
