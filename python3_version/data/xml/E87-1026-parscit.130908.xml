A PROPOSAL FOR MODIFICATIONS
IN THE FORMALISM OF GPSG
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976166666666">
Recent investigations show a remarkable conver-
gence among contemporary unification-based formal-
isms for syntactic description (cf Shieber 1985).
This convergence is now itself becoming an object
of study, and there is an increasing recognition
of the need for explicit characterizations of the
properties that relate and distinguish similar
grammar formalisms. For example, Shieber (1986)
describes a compilation from Generalized Phrase
Structure Grammar (GPSG; cf Gazdar et alii 1985,
henceforth GKPS) to PATR-II. The compilation de-
fines the semantics of GPSG by explicitly relating
the two formalisms; at the same time, difficulties
in specifying the compilation show that differ-
ences between the formalisms transcend variety in
notation.
This paper is similar to Shieber&apos;s in its aim
but differs in the approach. A series of changes
in the formalism of GPSG will be proposed that
make it look more like the &amp;quot;tool oriented&amp;quot; formal-
ism of Functional Unification Grammar (FUG; cf Kay
1984 and Shieber 1985). This notational transfor-
mation has two consequences: the essential and
nonessential differences between GPSG and FUG can
be made more apparent, and the internal structure
of GPSG itself becomes more homogeneous and trans-
parent.
The homogeneity of a formalism is desirable on
methodological grounds that amount to Occam&apos;s
principle of economy: entities should not be mul-
tiplied. This is not to suggest that linguistic
formalisms can be simplified at our will; on the
contrary, they must be complex and expressive
enough to capture the complexities inherent in
language itself. The burden of proof, however,
falls on those who choose more complicated and
heterogeneous notational devices.
Despite its restrictiveness in comparison with
current transformational theory, GPSG in the GKPS
version offers a rich palette of formal devices.
It introduces Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions
(FCRs) to state Boolean restrictions on the co-
occurrence of feature specifications within cate-
gories but does not explore the use of analogous
restrictions in other parts of the formalism. Im-
mediate Dominance rules, metarules, and lexical
rules are clearly distinguished in their form but
all serve to capture the phenomenon of subcategor-
ization.
This paper proposes the extension of cooccur-
rence restrictions in GPSG to express constraints
on the cooccurrence of categories within local
trees. While presented in Kilbury (1986) as a new
descriptive device, such Category Cooccurrence
Restrictions (CCRs) are in fact simply a general-
ization of principles fundamental to GKPS.
The motivation for CCRs is analogous to that
for distinguishing Immediate Dominance (ID) and
Linear Precedence (LP) rules in GPSG (cf GKPS,
pp. 44-50). A context free rule binds information
of two kinds in a single statement. By separating
this information in ID and LP rules, GPSG is able
to state generalizations of the sort &amp;quot;A precedes
B in every local tree which contains both as
daughters,&amp;quot; which cannot be captured in a context
free grammar.
Just as ID and LP rules capture generalizations
about sets of context free rules (or equivalently,
about local trees), CCRs can be seen as stating
more abstract generalizations about ID rules,
which in turn are equivalent to generalizations of
the following sort about local trees:

A as a daughter.
(2) No local tree with C as a daughter also has
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.973847153846154">
D as a daughter.
We can state CCRs as expressions of first order
predicate logic using two primitive predicates,
R(cx, t) &apos;oc is the root of local tree t&apos; and
D(oc, t) &apos;oc is a daughter in local tree t&apos;.
Advantages of CCRs are discussed in Kilbury
(1986): The metarules of GPSG can be eliminated as
an extra device of the formalism. As noted above,
generalizations can be captured that elude the ex-
pressive capabilities of GPSG. Moreover, CCRs ren-
der the GPSG formalism more homogeneous and estab-
lish a parallelism that can be expressed in the
traditional notation of an analogy:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.742408">
(3) FCR : category :: CCR : local tree
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995707779411765">
Linguistic items (categories and local trees)
and restrictions on such items make up the terms
of the above analogy. GPSG chooses to represent
the items and restrictions as different kinds of
object, whereas FUG has only one kind of object,
the functional description (FD), which Kay (1984:
76) defines as &amp;quot;a Boolean expression over fea-
tures&amp;quot; [i.e. GPSG feature specifications]. Thus,
a homogeneous formalism for GPSG is easily
achieved: just like cooccurrence restrictions, lin-
guistic items can be represented as Boolean ex-
pressions, namely, as conjunctions of atomic as-
sertions.
We shall henceforth regard a GPSG category as a
conjunction of assertions about the values as-
signed to features [i.e. FUG attributes]; the as-
sertions assigning these values constitute feature
specifications. Unlike FUG, which always allows
more information to be added to FDs and hence has
no notion of a complete description, GPSG has ful-
ly specified categories in which every feature
possible for the category is assigned a value.
Excluding certain extensions to GPSG for non-con-
text-free phenomena (et Gazdar and Pullum 1985),
GPSG allows only a finite number of categories for
a language, while FUG permits infinitely many FDs.
Like FDs, GPSG categories do not have a fixed term
structure, but this property is nonessential for
GPSG while being essential for FUG. It may be
added that the modifications to GPSG proposed here
leave it nonfunctional in Kay&apos;s sense.
FUG as described in Kay (1984) provides for
conjunction and disjunction but not for negation
in FDs. Karttunen (1984), however, argues for the
use of both disjunction and negation in unifica-
tion-grammar formalisms. GPSG has the full set of
logical connectives in FCRs, which are arbitrary
Boolean conditions on the cooccurrence of feature
specifications within categories; categories them-
selves, however, are restricted in form to con-
junctions of feature specifications. If the formal
distinction of GPSG between linguistic items and
linguistic restrictions is abandoned in favor of a
uniform representation for both as Boolean expres-
sions, we then can in effect use disjunction and
negation in the categories as well. Conversely, we
may view FCRs as partially instantiated catego-
ries, and CCRs correspondingly as partially in-
stantiated local trees.
All Boolean expres-ions can be written in con-
junctive normal form ,AF), i.e. as a conjunction
of disjunctions of li,..erals (positive or negated
atomic expressions). Expressions in CNF are in
turn equivalent to clause sets, i.e. sets of such
disjunctions. Given this uniform representation
for linguistic items and grammatical statements,
it should come as no surprise to see unification,
the principal operation of unification grammar, be
closely identified with resolution as introduced
by Robinson (1965) for automatic theorem proving.
Nevertheless, no previous version of unification
grammar has to my knowledge taken just this step.
The proposed operation differs somewhat from
resolution. While the resolution of the clause
sets {P} and 1.-P v Ql yields the resolvent
Q I, their unification in this sense produces
P, Q I. Some examples of such resolution-based
unification will be useful at this point:

Note that for any two atomic values al and a2,
the unification al LI a2 succeeds iff al = a2.

and v4 are atomic or complex), then the unifica-
tion C2 U C5 f2: (v2 LI v4)1 succeeds; if
v2 U v4 fails, then C2 U C5 also fails. The uni-
fication CI LI C5 has three cases:

FUG employs two special values, ANY and NONE,
which unify with any and no other value, respec-
tively. With the adoption of negation in the form-
alism, ANY and NONE emerge in the following dual
relationship:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.970666">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988832235294118">
A. f: NONE &apos;.-77 f: ANY (Def.)
ANY and NONE may be used in GPSG to express the
condition that a feature must or may not receive a
value. Shieber (1985: 32) notes that ANY consti-
tutes a nonmonotonic device in the formalism,
since final representations must not contain occur-
rences of ANY. In our terms, final representations
must not contain negation or disjunction, i.e.,
they must be sets of unit clauses, each of which
is a nonnegated literal. Since the logic upon
which this formalism is based is monotonic, how-
ever, the essential monotonicity of the formalism
is preserved.
GPSG goes a step further and introduces Feature
Specification Defaults (FSDs), which are a patent-
ly nonmonotonic device based on default logic.
This paper proposes banning them from the formal-
ism for the time being. Some of the particular
FSDs formulated in GKPS for English appear ques-
tionable under different analyses (cf Kilbury
1986). This is not.to deny that default statements
may capture significant generalizations about lan-
guage. But why, then, should defaults be confined
to the statement of restrictions on categories?
It may be methodologically advantageous to first
develop a more homogeneous and coherent formalism
for GPSG without strongly nonmonotonic devices.
If default logic later still appears desirable on
theoretical linguistic grounds, then it can be re-
introduced in a more principled fashion allowing
default statements at all levels of linguistic
description where it is useful.
The position of Linear Precedence (LP) state-
ments in this formalism must now be clarified. It
was stated above that CCRs are formulated using
the two primitive predicates R(oc, t) &apos;at is the
root of local tree t&apos; and D(4x, t) &apos;oc is a daugh-
ter in local tree t&apos;. This is not quite adequate
since different daughters in a local tree may be
tokens of the same category. Let us replace
D(x, t) with D(cc, i, t), interpreted as &apos;a is the
i-th daughter in local tree t&apos;. A local tree t
with VP as root and V, NP, and NP as daughters (in
that order) can now be represented with the fol-
lowing set of unit clauses:
(7) R(VP,t), D(V,1,t), D(NP,2,t), D(NP,3,t)
Likewise, the LP statement sz &lt;6 ,13 may not
precede oc in any local tree t&apos; (where &apos;&lt;&apos; denotes
the LP relationship) may be reformulated in a log-
ical expression (using &apos;(&apos; for arithmetic compari-
son) as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.893887">
(8) 1ft: ( D(oc, i, t) A D(B, j, t))D i&lt;j
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985960065217391">
This, in turn, can be represented as a set con-
taining one clause:
(9) (mwD(t, i, t) v ~D(6, j, t) v (i .1)) 1
If arithmetic comparison &apos;&lt;&apos; is now added to
the primitive predicates allowed in CCRs, then LP
statements become simply a special case of CCRs;
they are applied to local trees by resolution-
based unification with the representations of the
latter.
The principle of cooccurrence restrictions can
be further generalized in a final step. GPSG de-
scribes linguistic items and their distributions.
Local trees are arrangements of categories, which
in turn are arrangements of feature specifica-
tions; the latter are themselves items consisting
of a feature name and a feature value in an ar-
rangement. The formal devices already introduced
allow us to state cooccurrence restrictions gov-
erning the combination of features and values in
feature specifications; the definition of the
value range of a feature can thus be regarded as
another special case of cooccurrence restriction.
In summary, the essential contribution of this
paper lies in its generalization of the notion of
cooccurrence restriction. Many of the distinct
formal devices of GPSG as presented in GKPS can be
eliminated without an apparent loss of expressive
power, and the resulting formalism gains both in
simplicity and homogeneity while preserving essen-
tial properties of the GKPS formalism. Likewise,
the uniform representation of cooccurrence re-
strictions and linguistic items allows a new in-
terpretation of unification which is promising in
its own right and which should facilitate the com-
parison of GPSG with other unification-based gram-
mar formalisms. Parallels to other linguistic ap-
proaches, both more and less distant, should be
evident. Similarities to American structuralism
are neither accidental nor unintentional. In re-
gard to his own proposals for unification,
Karttunen (1984: 31) remarks that &amp;quot;the problems
that arise in this connection are very similar to
those that come up in logic programming.&amp;quot; Indeed,
many questions involving the equivalence of nota-
tions and of computational problems are raised
that must be addressed in future studies.

A PROPOSAL FOR MODIFICATIONS IN THE FORMALISM OF GPSG Recent investigations show a remarkable convergence among contemporary unification-based formalisms for syntactic description (cf Shieber 1985). This convergence is now itself becoming an object of study, and there is an increasing recognition of the need for explicit characterizations of the properties that relate and distinguish similar grammar formalisms. For example, Shieber (1986) describes a compilation from Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG; cf Gazdar et alii 1985, henceforth GKPS) to PATR-II. The compilation defines the semantics of GPSG by explicitly relating the two formalisms; at the same time, difficulties in specifying the compilation show that differences between the formalisms transcend variety in notation. This paper is similar to Shieber&apos;s in its aim but differs in the approach. A series of changes in the formalism of GPSG will be proposed that make it look more like the &amp;quot;tool oriented&amp;quot; formalism of Functional Unification Grammar (FUG; cf Kay 1984 and Shieber 1985). This notational transformation has two consequences: the essential and nonessential differences between GPSG and FUG can be made more apparent, and the internal structure of GPSG itself becomes more homogeneous and transparent. The homogeneity of a formalism is desirable on methodological grounds that amount to Occam&apos;s principle of economy: entities should not be multiplied. This is not to suggest that linguistic formalisms can be simplified at our will; on the contrary, they must be complex and expressive enough to capture the complexities inherent in language itself. The burden of proof, however, falls on those who choose more complicated and heterogeneous notational devices. Despite its restrictiveness in comparison with current transformational theory, GPSG in the GKPS version offers a rich palette of formal devices. It introduces Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions (FCRs) to state Boolean restrictions on the cooccurrence of feature specifications within categories but does not explore the use of analogous restrictions in other parts of the formalism. Immediate Dominance rules, metarules, and lexical rules are clearly distinguished in their form but all serve to capture the phenomenon of subcategorization. This paper proposes the extension of cooccurrence restrictions in GPSG to express constraints on the cooccurrence of categories within local trees. While presented in Kilbury (1986) as a new descriptive device, such Category Cooccurrence Restrictions (CCRs) are in fact simply a generalization of principles fundamental to GKPS. The motivation for CCRs is analogous to that for distinguishing Immediate Dominance (ID) and Linear Precedence (LP) rules in GPSG (cf GKPS, pp. 44-50). A context free rule binds information of two kinds in a single statement. By separating this information in ID and LP rules, GPSG is able to state generalizations of the sort &amp;quot;A precedes B in every local tree which contains both as daughters,&amp;quot; which cannot be captured in a context free grammar. Just as ID and LP rules capture generalizations about sets of context free rules (or equivalently, about local trees), CCRs can be seen as stating more abstract generalizations about ID rules, which in turn are equivalent to generalizations of the following sort about local trees: 156 (1) Any local tree with S as its root must have A as a daughter. (2) No local tree with C as a daughter also has D as a daughter. We can state CCRs as expressions of first order predicate logic using two primitive predicates, t) the root of local tree t&apos; and D(oc, t) &apos;oc is a daughter in local tree t&apos;. Advantages of CCRs are discussed in Kilbury (1986): The metarules of GPSG can be eliminated as an extra device of the formalism. As noted above, generalizations can be captured that elude the expressive capabilities of GPSG. Moreover, CCRs render the GPSG formalism more homogeneous and establish a parallelism that can be expressed in the traditional notation of an analogy: (3) FCR : category :: CCR : local tree Linguistic items (categories and local trees) and restrictions on such items make up the terms of the above analogy. GPSG chooses to represent the items and restrictions as different kinds of object, whereas FUG has only one kind of object, the functional description (FD), which Kay (1984: 76) defines as &amp;quot;a Boolean expression over features&amp;quot; [i.e. GPSG feature specifications]. Thus, a homogeneous formalism for GPSG is easily achieved: just like cooccurrence restrictions, linguistic items can be represented as Boolean expressions, namely, as conjunctions of atomic assertions. We shall henceforth regard a GPSG category as a conjunction of assertions about the values assigned to features [i.e. FUG attributes]; the assertions assigning these values constitute feature specifications. Unlike FUG, which always allows more information to be added to FDs and hence has no notion of a complete description, GPSG has fully specified categories in which every feature possible for the category is assigned a value. Excluding certain extensions to GPSG for non-context-free phenomena (et Gazdar and Pullum 1985), GPSG allows only a finite number of categories for a language, while FUG permits infinitely many FDs. Like FDs, GPSG categories do not have a fixed term structure, but this property is nonessential for GPSG while being essential for FUG. It may be added that the modifications to GPSG proposed here leave it nonfunctional in Kay&apos;s sense. FUG as described in Kay (1984) provides for conjunction and disjunction but not for negation in FDs. Karttunen (1984), however, argues for the use of both disjunction and negation in unification-grammar formalisms. GPSG has the full set of logical connectives in FCRs, which are arbitrary Boolean conditions on the cooccurrence of feature specifications within categories; categories themselves, however, are restricted in form to conjunctions of feature specifications. If the formal distinction of GPSG between linguistic items and linguistic restrictions is abandoned in favor of a uniform representation for both as Boolean expressions, we then can in effect use disjunction and negation in the categories as well. Conversely, we may view FCRs as partially instantiated categories, and CCRs correspondingly as partially instantiated local trees. Boolean can be written in connormal form i.e. as a conjunction of disjunctions of li,..erals (positive or negated atomic expressions). Expressions in CNF are in turn equivalent to clause sets, i.e. sets of such disjunctions. Given this uniform representation for linguistic items and grammatical statements, it should come as no surprise to see unification, the principal operation of unification grammar, be closely identified with resolution as introduced by Robinson (1965) for automatic theorem proving. Nevertheless, no previous version of unification grammar has to my knowledge taken just this step. The proposed operation differs somewhat from resolution. While the resolution of the clause 1.-P v the resolvent unification in this sense produces Q examples of such resolution-based unification will be useful at this point: = v = {f2:v2 } = 1 = v = I - - .v1&apos; u = v true)} U = that for any two atomic values and unification LI succeeds iff = (4) above, if U succeeds (whether atomic or complex), then the unifica- U LI succeeds; if then fails. The unithree cases: LI = (..true y and an U = v and extension of 157 U = (—false v 1 FUG employs two special values, ANY and NONE, which unify with any and no other value, respectively. With the adoption of negation in the formalism, ANY and NONE emerge in the following dual relationship: ^..f: ANY NONE (Def.) NONE &apos;.-77 f: ANY (Def.) ANY and NONE may be used in GPSG to express the condition that a feature must or may not receive a value. Shieber (1985: 32) notes that ANY constitutes a nonmonotonic device in the formalism, since final representations must not contain occurrences of ANY. In our terms, final representations must not contain negation or disjunction, i.e., they must be sets of unit clauses, each of which is a nonnegated literal. Since the logic upon which this formalism is based is monotonic, however, the essential monotonicity of the formalism is preserved. GPSG goes a step further and introduces Feature Specification Defaults (FSDs), which are a patently nonmonotonic device based on default logic. This paper proposes banning them from the formalism for the time being. Some of the particular FSDs formulated in GKPS for English appear questionable under different analyses (cf Kilbury 1986).

In summary, the essential contribution of this paper lies in its generalization of the notion of cooccurrence restriction. Many of the distinct formal devices of GPSG as presented in GKPS can be eliminated without an apparent loss of expressive power, and the resulting formalism gains both in simplicity and homogeneity while preserving essential properties of the GKPS formalism. Likewise, the uniform representation of cooccurrence restrictions and linguistic items allows a new interpretation of unification which is promising in its own right and which should facilitate the comparison of GPSG with other unification-based grammar formalisms. Parallels to other linguistic approaches, both more and less distant, should be evident. Similarities to American structuralism are neither accidental nor unintentional. In regard to his own proposals for unification, Karttunen (1984: 31) remarks that &amp;quot;the problems that arise in this connection are very similar to those that come up in logic programming.&amp;quot; Indeed, many questions involving the equivalence of notations and of computational problems are raised that must be addressed in future studies.</abstract>

Excluding certain extensions to GPSG for non-context-free phenomena (et Gazdar and Pullum 1985), GPSG allows only a finite number of categories for a language, while FUG permits infinitely many FDs. Like FDs, GPSG categories do not have a fixed term structure, but this property is nonessential for GPSG while being essential for FUG. It may be added that the modifications to GPSG proposed here leave it nonfunctional in Kay&apos;s sense. FUG as described in Kay (1984) provides for conjunction and disjunction but not for negation in FDs. Karttunen (1984), however, argues for the use of both disjunction and negation in unification-grammar formalisms. GPSG has the full set of logical connectives in FCRs, which are arbitrary Boolean conditions on the cooccurrence of feature specifications within categories; categories themselves, however, are restricted in form to conjunctions of feature specifications. If the formal distinction of GPSG between linguistic items and linguistic restrictions is abandoned in favor of a uniform representation for both as Boolean expressions, we then can in effect use disjunction and negation in the categories as well</context>

The compilation defines the semantics of GPSG by explicitly relating the two formalisms; at the same time, difficulties in specifying the compilation show that differences between the formalisms transcend variety in notation. This paper is similar to Shieber&apos;s in its aim but differs in the approach. A series of changes in the formalism of GPSG will be proposed that make it look more like the &amp;quot;tool oriented&amp;quot; formalism of Functional Unification Grammar (FUG; cf Kay 1984 and Shieber 1985). This notational transformation has two consequences: the essential and nonessential differences between GPSG and FUG can be made more apparent, and the internal structure of GPSG itself becomes more homogeneous and transparent. The homogeneity of a formalism is desirable on methodological grounds that amount to Occam&apos;s principle of economy: entities should not be multiplied. This is not to suggest that linguistic formalisms can be simplified at our will; on the contrary, they must be complex and expressive enough to capture the complexities inherent in language itself.

Moreover, CCRs render the GPSG formalism more homogeneous and establish a parallelism that can be expressed in the traditional notation of an analogy: (3) FCR : category :: CCR : local tree Linguistic items (categories and local trees) and restrictions on such items make up the terms of the above analogy. GPSG chooses to represent the items and restrictions as different kinds of object, whereas FUG has only one kind of object, the functional description (FD), which Kay (1984: 76) defines as &amp;quot;a Boolean expression over features&amp;quot; [i.e. GPSG feature specifications]. Thus, a homogeneous formalism for GPSG is easily achieved: just like cooccurrence restrictions, linguistic items can be represented as Boolean expressions, namely, as conjunctions of atomic assertions. We shall henceforth regard a GPSG category as a conjunction of assertions about the values assigned to features [i.e. FUG attributes]; the assertions assigning these values constitute feature specifications.

It introduces Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions (FCRs) to state Boolean restrictions on the cooccurrence of feature specifications within categories but does not explore the use of analogous restrictions in other parts of the formalism. Immediate Dominance rules, metarules, and lexical rules are clearly distinguished in their form but all serve to capture the phenomenon of subcategorization. This paper proposes the extension of cooccurrence restrictions in GPSG to express constraints on the cooccurrence of categories within local trees. While presented in Kilbury (1986) as a new descriptive device, such Category Cooccurrence Restrictions (CCRs) are in fact simply a generalization of principles fundamental to GKPS. The motivation for CCRs is analogous to that for distinguishing Immediate Dominance (ID) and Linear Precedence (LP) rules in GPSG (cf GKPS, pp. 44-50). A context free rule binds information of two kinds in a single statement. By separating this information in ID and LP rules, GPSG is able to state generalizations of the sort &amp;quot;A precedes B in every local tree which contains both as daughters,&amp;quot; which cannot be captured in a context free grammar.

(2) No local tree with C as a daughter also has D as a daughter. We can state CCRs as expressions of first order predicate logic using two primitive predicates, R(cx, t) &apos;oc is the root of local tree t&apos; and D(oc, t) &apos;oc is a daughter in local tree t&apos;. Advantages of CCRs are discussed in Kilbury (1986): The metarules of GPSG can be eliminated as an extra device of the formalism. As noted above, generalizations can be captured that elude the expressive capabilities of GPSG. Moreover, CCRs render the GPSG formalism more homogeneous and establish a parallelism that can be expressed in the traditional notation of an analogy: (3) FCR : category :: CCR : local tree Linguistic items (categories and local trees) and restrictions on such items make up the terms of the above analogy.

Since the logic upon which this formalism is based is monotonic, however, the essential monotonicity of the formalism is preserved. GPSG goes a step further and introduces Feature Specification Defaults (FSDs), which are a patently nonmonotonic device based on default logic. This paper proposes banning them from the formalism for the time being. Some of the particular FSDs formulated in GKPS for English appear questionable under different analyses (cf Kilbury 1986). This is not.to deny that default statements may capture significant generalizations about language. But why, then, should defaults be confined to the statement of restrictions on categories? It may be methodologically advantageous to first develop a more homogeneous and coherent formalism for GPSG without strongly nonmonotonic devices. If default logic later still appears desirable on theoretical linguistic grounds, then it can be reintroduced in a more principled fashion allowing default statements at all levels of linguistic description where it is useful.

All Boolean expres-ions can be written in conjunctive normal form ,AF), i.e. as a conjunction of disjunctions of li,..erals (positive or negated atomic expressions). Expressions in CNF are in turn equivalent to clause sets, i.e. sets of such disjunctions. Given this uniform representation for linguistic items and grammatical statements, it should come as no surprise to see unification, the principal operation of unification grammar, be closely identified with resolution as introduced by Robinson (1965) for automatic theorem proving. Nevertheless, no previous version of unification grammar has to my knowledge taken just this step. The proposed operation differs somewhat from resolution. While the resolution of the clause sets {P} and 1.-P v Ql yields the resolvent Q I, their unification in this sense produces P, Q I. Some examples of such resolution-based unification will be useful at this point: (4) C1 = ifi:vi, (A,f2:v2 v f3:v3) C2 = {f2:v2 } C3 = {f3:v3 1 C4 = if2:v2 v f4:v4 C5 = f2:v4 I C1 UC2 - - if1&apos; .v1&apos; f2:v2, (^,truevf3:v3)1 = if1:v1&apos; f2:v2&apos; f3:v3 C1 u c3 = {fi:vi, f3:v3, (..vf2:v2 </context>
