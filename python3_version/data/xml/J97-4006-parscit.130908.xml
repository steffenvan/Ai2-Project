The Balancing Act is intended as an exploration into research combining rule-based
and corpus-based approaches, that is, qualitative and quantitative methods. The book
consists of eight chapters, six of which represent papers selected and revised from
those originally presented at the workshop of the same name held following the 1994
annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, with two papers
newly added. The papers contained in the book can be classified as follows: Chap-
ters 1 (Steven Abney) and 5 (Shyam Kapur and Robin Clark) are concerned with the
statistical modeling of linguistic theories, and in particular Chomskyan theory. Chap-
ters 3 (Beatrice Daille) and 4 (Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou) deal with corpus-based lexical
acquisition. Chapters 2 (Hiyan Alshawi) and 8 (Carolyn Penstein Rosé and Alex H.
Waibel) discuss the task of balancing the roles of statistics and rules in the context of
a working system. Chapter 6 (Patti Price) provides a good survey of the history of the
marriage of speech recognition and language processing research. Finally, Chapter 7
(Lance A. Ramshaw and Mitchell P. Marcus) describes a part-of-speech tagger.
The first paper in the book is Abney&apos;s, entitled &amp;quot;Statistical methods and linguis-
tics.&amp;quot; Abney&apos;s main claim is that statistical approaches contribute not only to language
processing, but also to the understanding of language itself. He argues that stochastic
grammars play an important role in the handling of a number of theoretical linguistic
issues. The principal emphasis of the paper is on syntactic issues, with little description
given of the incorporation of semantic and pragmatic factors into a statistical system,
or of their interaction with syntax.
In contrast to Abney&apos;s general discussion of the contributions of statistics to the-
oretical linguistics, the work presented by Kapur and Clark in Chapter 5 gives a
specific example of this type of statistical application. In this chapter, Kapur and Clark
introduce the notion of a Parameter-Setting Machine (PSM), and propose a means of
using corpus data to learn the parameters required to facilitate Chomskyan theory.
Unfortunately, the title of the paper, &amp;quot;The automatic construction of a symbolic parser
via statistical techniques,&amp;quot; is rather misleading given that the paper deals only with
word-order parameters; but despite this, the paper gives an interesting insight into
the extent to which such an approach can be applied to learning other parameters.
Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the acquisition of lexical knowledge from corpora.
Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 4
In Chapter 3, &amp;quot;Study and implementation of combined techniques for automatic ex-
traction of terminology,&amp;quot; Daille discusses the automatic extraction of terminology for
specific domains. As an example domain, she considers French telecommunications,
and attempts to extract compound terms as component word pairs, reasoning that
terms composed of three or more words can be reduced to a set of pairwise relations.
The proposed extraction process is made up of two phases, namely the linguistic
filtering phase and the statistical filtering phase. In the first phase, each candidate
term is checked against predefined, linguistically motivated, patterns such as N adj or
Ni prep N2. Collocation statistics are then calculated from the candidate terms derived
during the first stage. This statistical filtering phase involves more than ten kinds of
statistical measures, including simple frequency and mutual information. The results
obtained from the different types of statistical filters indicate that, surprisingly, simple
frequency returns the best result. Daille attributes this to the use of linguistic filters
prior to statistical calculation.
Chapter 4, &amp;quot;Do we need linguistics when we have statistics? A comparative anal-
ysis of the contributions of linguistic cues to a statistical word grouping system,&amp;quot; dis-
cusses a similar acquisition task based on linguistic knowledge and focuses on group-
ing adjectives with regard to their patterns of usage. Following his previous work
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993), Hatzivassiloglou thoroughly investigates the
effectiveness of various kinds of linguistic knowledge, and also the cost of acquiring
linguistic knowledge. The cost of knowledge acquisition represents a unique view-
point in this type of research and constitutes yet another important facet of the overall
balancing act.
There is no doubt that the success of statistical techniques in speech recognition
has had a considerable influence on the language processing community. In Chapter 6,
&amp;quot;Combining linguistics with statistical methods in automatic speech understanding,&amp;quot;
Price discusses the evolution of speech understanding from speech recognition and lan-
guage processing research. She summarizes the cultural gaps between these research
areas (her Table 6.1), and goes on to propose ways in which they can contribute to
each other.
Both Chapters 2 and 8 deal with speech translation, but with different emphases.
In Chapter 2, &amp;quot;Qualitative and quantitative models of speech translation,&amp;quot; Alshawi
discusses the question of which components of an overall system statistical approaches
should be introduced into. In Chapter 8, &amp;quot;Recovering from parser failures: A hybrid
statistical and symbolic approach,&amp;quot; Rosé and Waibel propose a method of using parse
fragments to recover from a parse error. Their system tries to construct a feature-
structure-style intermediate representation from the set of parse fragments, relying on
collocational preferences for slot types and fillers.
In Chapter 7, &amp;quot;Exploring the nature of transformation-based learning,&amp;quot; Ramshaw
and Marcus discuss the advantages of a Brill-like approach (Brill 1992) over pure
stochastic (hidden Markov model) and symbolic (decision tree) methods, using both
qualitative and quantitative evaluation. They claim that Brill&apos;s approach suffers less
from over-training than is the case for HMMs or decision trees because the rules ex-
tracted in Brill&apos;s approach are more loosely interdependent. This is due to HMMs being
overly monolithic and the structure of decision trees being too rigidly hierarchical. In
their evaluation, Ramshaw and Marcus analyzed the dependencies between learned
rules and found that more general rules tend to apply at an early stage, but that more
specific rules may override this effect at a later stage if necessary While the paper
leaves much room for further exploration of Brill&apos;s approach, particularly of its more
theoretical aspects, it does point to this being one promising approach to combining
symbolic and statistical techniques.

From the experiences of corpus-based NLP research over the last decade, it is
obvious that there is an inherent limitation to knowledge obtained from unannotated
text. As a result, corpora have been annotated, and new attempts have been made to
extract linguistic knowledge from these more information-rich sources. There has been
a widespread belief that describing linguistic knowledge from scratch is expensive, but
annotating corpora is not free either. Thus, further exploration of the cost-effectiveness
of corpus-based research is required. That is, we are at the stage of being able to
discuss where we should invest human labor in order to obtain linguistic knowledge
of a certain level of quality.
