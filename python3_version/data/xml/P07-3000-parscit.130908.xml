On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we are pleased to present the proceedings of the Student
Research Workshop held at the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics
(ACL) in Prague, Czech Republic, June 25–27, 2007. The Student Research Workshop is an established
tradition at the Annual Meetings of the Association for Computational Linguistics and builds on the
success of no less than 16 previous student sessions at ACL meetings.
Students in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and related fields were offered
the possibility to present their work in a setting embedded in the main conference. The workshop plays
an integral role in ACL’s efforts to build and maintain a research community by investing in young
researchers that will shape the field in the years to come. The workshop aimed at providing feedback
from senior to beginner researchers. In the call for papers, we explicitly aimed at students in an early
stage of their Ph.D. work. We felt that this group could gain the most benefit from this event, as the
experts’ feedback can still influence their research directions.
The Program Committee was compiled such that about half of the reviewers were students or young
researchers, and the other half consisted of senior scientists. This mixture ensures that the scientific
quality of reviews is high, while student-specific issues are well understood by the committee members.
We are indebted to our 52 reviewers for their elaborate, thoughtful and high quality reviews, which will
also be of great help to those students whose work could not be accepted for presentation.
We received 52 submissions from all over the world, of which 16 were accepted for presentation: 9 for
oral presentation and 7 for poster presentation. The presentation format was assigned based on thoughts
about how the work could be presented best, and does not indicate a quality difference among papers,
which are all fixed to the same length of 6 pages.
This year’s workshop features contributions from a wide range of topics. Various issues on grammar are
dealt with in five papers: Richard Johansson uses logistic online learning for incremental dependency
parsing, Nathan C. Sanders measures syntactic differences in British English, Elias Ponvert induces
combinatory categorial grammars with genetic algorithms, Bart Cramer investigates limitations of
current grammar induction techniques, and Aleksander Buczy´nski describes an implementation that
combines partial parsing and morphosyntactic disambiguation.
Another five contributions can be subsumed under the scope of semantics: Radosław Moszczy´nski
provides a classification of multi-word expressions especially for highly inflected languages, Paul
Nulty classifies noun phrases along semantic properties using web counts and machine learning,
Diarmuid O´ S´eaghdha annotates and learns compound noun semantics, Kata G´abor and Enik˝o H´eja
cluster Hungarian verbs by complementation patterns, and Silke Scheible lays out foundations of a
computational treatment of superlatives.
Research on dialects and different languages is carried out by three papers: Andrea Mulloni performs
cognate prediction in a bilingual setting, Yves Scherrer presents adaptive measures to graphemic
similarity for inducing dialect lexicons, and Jelena Proki´c identifies linguistic structure in a quantitative
analysis of Bulgarian dialects. For opinionated Chinese Information Retrieval, Taras Zagibalov
examines the utility of various features. Structuring texts is the topic of two papers: Olena Medelyan
uses graph clustering to compute lexical chains, and Martina Naughton exploits structure for event
discovery using the MDI algorithm.
Following the workshop tradition, a panel of senior researchers will take part in the presentation of
papers, providing in-depth comments on the work of each author either immediately after the oral
presentation or in front of the poster. We would like to thank the panelists in advance for fulfilling such
an important role.
Many people contributed to the success of this year’s Student Research Workshop. Apart from Program
Committee members and panelists, we would like to thank the ACL conference organizers for involving
us in their planning, the webmasters for swiftly handling update requests for the SRW page, the
publication chair for providing us the facilities to compile this volume, and, most of all, the students
for their hard work in preparing their submissions. Finally, we are grateful to the National Science
Foundation for generously sponsoring our event: All student presenters received reimbursement of
registration and accommodation as well as almost full coverage of travel costs.
