Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999621">
Linguistic porting of content manage-
ment services processing spontaneous ut-
terances in natural language has become
important. In most situations, such utter-
ances are noisy, but are constrained by
the situation, thus constituting a restricted
sublangage. In previous papers, we have
presented three methods to port such sys-
tems to other languages. In this paper, we
study how to also personalize them by
making them capable of automatic per-
ception adaptation, using fuzzy evalu-
ation functions. We have reengineered
IMRS, a music retrieval NL-based sys-
tem, to implement that idea, and ported it
to French, English and Arabic using an
enhanced version of our external porting
method, building a unique content extrac-
tor for these three languages. More than
30 persons participated in a preliminary
on-line qualitative evaluation of the sys-
tem.

Multilingualizing systems handling content ex-
pressed in spontaneous natural language is an
important but difficult problem, and very few
multilingual services are available today. The
choice of a particular multilingualization process
depends on the translational situation: types and
levels of possible accesses, available resources,
and linguistic competences of participants in-
volved in the multilingualization task. Three
main strategies are possible in principle for
multilingualization, by translation, and by inter-

subproblem of linguistic porting, where the con-
tent is adapted to another language, but not ne-
cessarily to a different cultural environment. We
also try to add some level of personalization, by
automatic perception adaptation, based on the
use of fuzzy evaluation functions. We use the
example of IMRS, an Impression-based Music-
Retrieval System (Kumamoto, 2004), with a na-
tive interface in Japanese, which we have reengi-
neered and ported to French, English and Arabic.
The context and objectives of our work are pre-
sented in the second section. The third section
presents the IMRS original prototype and the
possible strategies to achieve porting and person-
alization. In the fourth section, we give detailed
specifications of our reengineered music retrieval
system, IMRS-g. In the fifth section, we present
the implementation of five music retrieval
modes. Finally, we report on the multilingual
porting of this system.

• The level of access to resources of the initial
application. Four cases are possible: complete
access to the source code, access limited to

NLP) and the resources (corpora, dictionaries)
available for the new language(s), in particu-
lar for the sublanguages at hand.
We concentrate on NLP-based systems that
perform specific tasks in restricted domains.
Figure 1 shows the general structure of these sys-
tems. Examples of such applications and services
are: categorization of various documents such as
AFP (Agence France Presse) flash reports or cus-
tomer messages on an ASS (After Sale Service)
server, and information extraction to feed or con-
sult a database (e.g. classified ads, FAQ, auto-
mated hotlines).

We first studied linguistic porting of e-
commerce systems handling spontaneous utter-
ances in natural languages, that are often noisy,
but constrained by the situation, and constitute a
more or less restricted sub-language (Kittredge,
1982), (Harris, 1968) (Grishman and Kittredge,
1986).
This kind of system uses a specific content
representation on which the functional kernel
works. In most cases, this content representation
is generated from the native language L1 by a
content extractor. In our PhD, we have identified
three possible methods of linguistic porting, and
have illustrated them by porting to French CATS
(Daoud, 2006), a Classified Ads Transaction
System in SMS (Arabic) deployed in Amman on
Fastlink, as well as IMRS, mentioned above. The
three possible strategies for linguistic porting are
internal porting, external porting and porting by
machine translation. Figure 2 shows an example
of the car domain with the output of the content
extractor (CRL-CATS).
In CRL-CATS (Content Representation Lan-
guage for CATS), a posted SMS is represented
as a set of binary relations between objects. It is
a kind of semantic graph with a UNL-like syntax
(Uchida and Zhu 2005-2006). There are no vari-
ables, but the dictionary is used as a type lattice
allowing specialization and generalization.

The first possibility consists in adapting the ori-

to the target language L2 (see Figure 3); but that
is viable only if :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993156833333333">
• the developers agree to open their code and
tools,
• the code and tools are relatively easy to un-

particular the dictionary).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9940972">
That method requires of course training the lo-
calization team with the tools and methods used.
Under these conditions, adaptation can be
done at a very reasonable cost, and further main-
tenance.

We have previously experimented this method
(Hajlaoui, 2008) by porting CATS from Arabic to

Zhu 1999), by translating its dictionary, and
modifying a few analysis rules.

2.2 External porting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994908190476191">
If there is access only to the internal content rep-
resentation, the solution consists in adapting an
available content extractor for L2 to the sublan-
guage at hand, and to compile its results into the
original content representation (see Figure 4).
For a company wanting to offer multilinguali-
zation services, it would indeed be an ideal situa-
tion to have a generic content extractor, and to
adapt it to each situation (language, sublanguage,
domain, content representation, task, other con-
straints). However, there is still no known ge-
neric content extractor of that power, and not
even a generic content extractor for particular
languages, so that this approach cannot be con-
sidered at present. Our approach is then to adapt
an existing content extractor, developed for L2
and a different domain/task, or for another lan-
guage and the same domain/task.
We also applied this method to port CATS
from Arabic to French, and experimentation are
described in (Hajlaoui, 2008).

<bodyText confidence="0.999866928571429">
If there is no access to the code, dictionary, and
internal content representation of the original
application, the only possible approach to port it
from L1 to L2 is to develop an MT system to
automatically translate its (spontaneous) inputs
from L2 into L1 (see Figure 5).
Porting CATS from Arabic to French by stat-
istical translation gave a very good performance,
and that with a very small training corpus (less
than 10 000 words). This proves that, in the case
of very small sub-languages, statistical transla-
tion may be of sufficient quality, starting from a
corpus 100 to 500 smaller than for the general
language.

2.4 Results and evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988945366666667">
We translated manually the evaluation corpus
used for the evaluation of CATS Arabic version.
It contains 200 real SMS (100 SMS to buy + 100
SMS to sale) posted by real users in Jordan.
We spent 289 mn to translate the 200 Arabic
SMS (2082 words is equivalent to 10
words/SMS, approximately 8 standard pages2)
into a French translation, or about 35 mn per
page, and 10 mn per standard page to pass from
raw translation to functional translation.
We obtained 200 French SMS considered to
be functional (1361 words, or about 6,8
words/SMS, approximately 5 standard pages).
We then computed the recall R, the precision P
and the F-measure F for each most important
property (action “sale or buy”, “make”, “model”,
“year”, “price”).
P = |correct entities identified by the system |/
|entities identified by the system|;
R = |correct entities identified by the system |/
|entities identified by the human|;
F-measure = 2PR/(P+R)
Table 1 summarizes the percentage (F-
measure ratio) of the Arabic-French porting of
CATS and shows details in (Hajlaoui, 2008).
Properties having numbers as values, like price
and year, lower the percentage of porting by ex-
ternal porting, but the advantage is that method
requires only accessing the internal representa-
tion of the application.

In the third part of this article, we describe the
multilinguization of IMRS, IMRS-g, which in-
cludes a module of queries management, where
the queries are expressed either in a natural lan-
guage or in a graphical interface showing 10 vec-
tors corresponding to the internal content repre-
sentation. In response to a query, the user re-
ceives a set of music pieces that correspond to
her/his desired selection criteria.
In addition to the original design, where the
NL expressions of the 10 measures are mapped
in a fixed way to the integers in the real interval
[1, 7], we have tried to apply a small part of the
theory of fuzzy sets to improve the representa-
tion and evaluation of human perceptions.

<bodyText confidence="0.969317071428572">
IMRS (Kumamoto and Ohta, 2003) is a non-
deployed Web service prototype, developed as
an experimental base for a PhD. It allows to re-
trieve music pieces either by using Japanese
queries, or by manipulating a graphical interface
with 10 criteria settable by knobs (speed, noise,
rhythm...), and showing remarkable values (inte-
gers between 1 and 7) expressed by English la-
bels. In IMRS, an utterance processed by the sys-
tem is a spontaneous sentence or fragment of a
sentence. The content extractor transforms it into
a vector of 10 real numbers in the interval [1, 7].
The symbol nil means don’t care.
The 10 components are called Noisy-Quiet,

vulnerable. Each has associated grades (inter-
preted as &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot; below). For example, the
component Happy-Sad is characterized by the
seven grades: very happy, happy, a little happy,
medium, a little sad, sad and very sad. In the ori-
ginal IMRS, these values always correspond to
the integers in the [1, 7] interval, respectively
7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0 and 1.0.
A request to find a piece of music that gives a
happy impression (happy) corresponds to the 10-
dimensional vector as follows: (nil nil nil nil nil
nil nil 6.0 nil nil) (Kumamoto, 2007), but the
music pieces can be described by vectors having
non-integer components.
Although we had a quite precise description of
the internal representation used by IMRS. We
could not find information on the rest of the sys-
tem. Hence, we recreated it to emulate the func-
tions described in the original publications. That
includes the system architecture, the design and
implementation of the database, the management
of requests, and the programming of actually
much more than the originally proposed service.
By definition, linguistic porting consists in
making an application existing in some language
L1 available in another language L2, within the
same context. Evaluation of the linguistic porting
of a content management application can be done
at two levels.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986514">
• Evaluation at the internal representation
level. It is an evaluation at the level of com-
ponents.
• Evaluation at the task level. It is an end-to-
end evaluation of the new version (in L2) of
the application.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999701">
To make an end-to-end evaluation of IMRS,
an IMRS Web-based simulator was developed. It
makes it possible to evaluate in context the result
of linguistic porting (Japanese — French, Arabic,
English). A real database with real music pieces,
characterized by 10-dimensional vectors as in
IMRS, was also created.
The aim of the multilinguization was however
not to develop an application strictly equivalent
to IMRS, with the addition of being able to han-
dle queries expressed in French, English and
Arabic, but to develop an upward compatible,
extended application. In particular, we wanted to
add other dimensions corresponding to the type
of music, the composer, the period of compo-
sition, the instruments used, etc. We also wanted
to experiment the possibility to associate to each
impression such as happy a fuzzy set over [1,7]
expressed by a membership function (into [0,1]).

PHP/MySQL a Web service called IMRS-g, re-
implementing as accurately as possible the sys-
tem IMRS, and generalizing it.
Not having sufficient expertise in Japanese,
we replaced Japanese by French. We also ad-
apted the NLP part to English and Arabic, using
the same strategy to handle the three languages.
We then generalized the internal representa-
tion by adding other search criteria (such as the
type of music, the composer, the period of com-
position, and the instruments used), and using
fuzzy sets.
A large set of music pieces was loaded into the
database, and labelled by vectors in a collabor-
ative way. An evaluation of the French version
was then conducted as part of a realistic use, with
students listening to music.
The first part of the linguistic porting has been
very rapid, since it consisted only in translating
into French and Arabic the NL labels expressing
impressions (Noisy/Quiet, Calm/Agitated,
Sad/Happy, etc.), by associating them the same
values as in IMRS.
The content extractor processes simple utter-
ances and extracts from them a 10-dimensional
IMRS vector, and the additional information in
the form (lists of) of items.
As in IMRS, a request for a music piece can
be made either by typing a query in natural lan-
guage, or through a graphical interface allowing
to manipulate a 10-dimensional vector, and to fill
fields for the other types of information.
In response, the user receives a list of links to
music pieces corresponding to its selection cri-
teria. Clicking on a link starts the playing of the
corresponding music piece.
3.3 Generalization by fuzzying the interpre-
tation of the NL labels
The original representation of IMRS seems too
rigid to express utterances like quite calm or to
change the current request using an utterance like
a little slower. Even if we agree that each term
corresponds to an interval of length 1 centred on
its reference value, e.g. [5.5, 6.5[ for happy, [6.5,
7.5] for very happy, etc., there are problems at
the extremities. Therefore we studied the possi-
bility of better modelling and better processing
the requests by using fuzzy logic (Zadeh, 1965).
In order to reason from imperfect knowledge,
in contrast to classical logic, fuzzy logic pro-
poses to replace the Boolean variables used in
classical logic by fuzzy variables, and the classi-
cal crisp sets by fuzzy sets.
Let U be a universe of elements. A fuzzy set A
over U is defined by its membership function
(fA). An element x of U is in A with a degree of
membership fA(x) E [0, 1]. If fA(x) E {0, 1}, A
reduces to a classic set, where x E A if fA(x)=1
and x 0 A if fA(x)=0 (fA is then simply the char-
acteristic function of A).
In a fuzzy set, an element x more or less be-
longs to the concept associated to A, or to the
concept attached to A (such as happy). A fuzzy
set is defined by all values of its membership
function on its definition domain (which may be
discrete or continuous).
For example, the concept young might be de-
fined over the universe U of possible (integer)
ages U = [0, 120] by the discrete fuzzy set A =
((10 1), (20 0.8), (30 0.6), (40 0.2), (50, 0.1), (60
0), (70 0), (80 0)). The first pair means that a 10-
year old is 100% young, and the fifth that a 50-
year old is 10% young.
Using fuzzy logic, we could say that a piece of
music is 100% rapid if its tempo is 100 (100
crotchets (quarter notes) per minute), with a bell-
shaped curve for the membership function, rising
from 0 to 1 and then falling, in the range [84,
112]. Then, rapid might be understood as im-
pression of rapidity. As the impression of ra-
pidity may differ from person to person, that
curve may differ accordingly.

<figureCaption confidence="0.74522">

We propose to incorporate the possibility to
move from the perceptions to digital measure-
ments and to personalize the system by learning
parameters of each curve of this type for each
user. Such a curve can be characterized by a
small number of significant points, such as the
maximum, 2 points at the 10% below the maxi-
mum, 2 minima on each side, and 2 points at
10% above the global minimum.

To find the criteria for each piece of music, we
have developed a website to ask a group of peo-
ple to listen to music pieces and to give their
opinions in terms of impressions, knowing that
they will not have the same taste and the same
perception. For example, for the same piece, a
first listener will say that it is rapid, and a second
will find it very rapid. The question here is how
to merge these different views into a single im-
pression. We propose two solutions: (1) con-
struct a fuzzy set which is the average of those of
annotators, possibly by giving greater weight to
the annotations of confirmed annotators, (2)
build several perception types, i.e. several fuzzy
sets corresponding to subgroups of users with
similar perceptions. We know that the Japanese
persons find only slow pieces of music that Wes-
terners find very slow.
In this work, we have taken into account pre-
vious queries of users or the history of users. For
example, if a user requests a piece a little less
noisy, or a little more calm, we should be able to
use the information saved in his history, and cal-
culate the new request taking into account the
perceptions associated to the last piece of music
listened to.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999134076923077">
We specified and implemented a multimedia
database for storing music pieces, as well as in-
formation representing the impressions of each
piece. As said above, we added to the 10 features
of IMRS other information types: singer, poet,
composer, genre, album and duration, for each
music piece. Moreover, to evaluate music, we
stored the values of the impressions recorded by
contributing users for each piece. These values
were used to produce the final values stored in
the database. To analyze the impressions of
users, we requested further information from
each user, as gender and age.
We loaded our database with a set of 354
pieces (89 Western, 265 Eastern) and all infor-
mation related to each piece (artist, album,
genre...). The duration of individual pieces varies
between 48 seconds and 22 minutes.
The website has a login page that allows a se-
cured access for each user. For a first connection,
the user must register and fill some information
from which we compute and store a profile.
If the connection is successful, a list of pieces
is displayed. For each piece, a link allows listen-
ing to the music and also opens a new page pro-
viding an adapted evaluation interface appropri-
ate to the evaluation task.
In the evaluation phase, the user can listen to
the selected piece and evaluate it according to the
10 IMRS basic criteria (soft, calm, happy...). For
each criterion, we offer a range of values and the
user can move a cursor and put it on the value
that represents its perception. Next, we propose
several ways to search for music pieces.
The cost of multilinguization of the IMRS sys-
tem was 3 man-months. To this cost, we add 1
man-month for the development and integration
task of the content extractor for the three lan-
guages (French, Arabic, English).

The content extractor works for French, Arabic
and English, and handles simple utterances re-

input a corpus of music pieces and gives as out-
put a file containing the corresponding vector
representations.
The search method has the following steps:

<listItem confidence="0.970871">
• Enter an utterance in natural language repre-
senting impressions of music search.
• Call a content extractor. The result, which
contains a vector representing the desired per-
ceptions, is stored in a text file.
• Extract the vector from the text file.
• For each value of the vector (Vv), if one of
the symbols (+, + +, -, --,¬) appears, then we
extract the value of the last search of the con-
cerned user (Vo: old value) from the database
to compute the new value of search (Vn: new
value).

Here are some examples of utterances that cor-

only the 4 values obtained by the conditions
((a), (b), (c), (d)).
Here an example of a history of one user. For
condition (a), the latest search value is “Pop”.
For condition (b), there is no value, i.e. the user
did not search by creation date. For condition (c),
the latest search value is “1” (number of the ar-
tist). For condition (d), the latest search value is
“2” (number of the album). For condition (e),
there are 3 vectors in the search history:
V1=(2 5 Nil 3 Nil 2 7 1 Nil Nil)
V2=(3 Nil 4.5 2.5 Nil 3.1 6.4 Nil 5 2)
V3=(3.5 4.3 Nil 2.1 Nil Nil Nil 3 Nil Nil)
We compute the average of the history, Vm:
Vm=(2.83 4.65 4.5 2.53 Nil 2.55 6.7 2 5 2)
We search for pieces that verify the complex
condition: (Kind of music = &apos;Pop&apos;) AND (Num-
ber of the artist =&apos;1&apos;) AND (Album ID =&apos;2&apos;) AND
(Impressions vector is closest to Vm according to
the Euclidean distance).
If the search is successful, then the result is
optimal. Otherwise, we search pieces that corres-
pond to the second condition: ((Kind of music =
&apos;Pop&apos;) OR (Number of the artist =&apos;1&apos;) OR (Album
ID =&apos;2&apos;)) AND (Impressions vector is closest to
Vm according to the Euclidean distance).
We refined this search through other combina-
tions formed by the conditions (a), (b), (c), (d)
and (e) and differentiated by the OR and AND
operators.

6 Multilingual porting
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991426">
To build our content extractor, we started from a
content extractor for French we had previously
develop for the same domain, integrated it into
IMRS-g, and extended it as explained above
(more information type, and fuzzy sets). We then
ported it to English and to Arabic, using the sec-
ond technique of external porting (when one has
access to the internal representation).
Seeing the large percentage of common code
to the 3 content extractors obtained, we factor-
ised it and obtained a unique content extractor
handling input utterances in the music domain in
our 3 target languages: French, English and Ara-
bic. This technique is perhaps not generalizable,
but it works for this sub-language, which is very
small, and for the simple task of extracting in-
formation representable in very small textual
fragments.
Here are some examples of results for Arabic,
French and English:

we have produced a functional Web site
(http://www-
clips.imag.fr/geta/User/najeh.hajlaoui/Musique/).
To date, the evaluation has been done only for
French. More than 30 users have participated,
perhaps because they were rewarded in a sense:
as a kind of compensation, each user could listen
to appropriate music adapted to his way of per-
ception and taste. The use of fuzzy logic proved
useful and was perhaps even necessary to give
some freedom of choice of impressions to users.

That method requires of course training the localization team with the tools and methods used. Under these conditions, adaptation can be done at a very reasonable cost, and further maintenance. Figure 3: internal porting We have previously experimented this method (Hajlaoui, 2008) by porting CATS from Arabic to French: for that, we adapted its native Arabic content extractor, written in EnCo1 (Uchida and Zhu 1999), by translating its dictionary, and modifying a few analysis rules. 1 EnCo is a tool based on rules and dictionaries used for content extraction in original version of CATS system. ;Selling Renault Megane m 2000 [S] sal(saloon:00,sale:00) mak(saloon:00,RENAULT(country&lt;France, county&lt;europe):07) mod(saloon:00,Megane(country&lt;France, country &lt;europe,make&lt;RENAULT):0C) yea(saloon:00,2000:0K) [/S] 80 2.2 External porting If there is access only to the internal cont</context>

However, there is still no known generic content extractor of that power, and not even a generic content extractor for particular languages, so that this approach cannot be considered at present. Our approach is then to adapt an existing content extractor, developed for L2 and a different domain/task, or for another language and the same domain/task. We also applied this method to port CATS from Arabic to French, and experimentation are described in (Hajlaoui, 2008). Figure 4: external porting 2.3 Porting by machine translation If there is no access to the code, dictionary, and internal content representation of the original application, the only possible approach to port it from L1 to L2 is to develop an MT system to automatically translate its (spontaneous) inputs from L2 into L1 (see Figure 5). Porting CATS from Arabic to French by statistical translation gave a very good performance, and that with a very small training corpus (less than 10 000 words).

In our PhD, we have identified three possible methods of linguistic porting, and have illustrated them by porting to French CATS (Daoud, 2006), a Classified Ads Transaction System in SMS (Arabic) deployed in Amman on Fastlink, as well as IMRS, mentioned above.

We also try to add some level of personalization, by automatic perception adaptation, based on the use of fuzzy evaluation functions. We use the example of IMRS, an Impression-based MusicRetrieval System (Kumamoto, 2004), with a native interface in Japanese, which we have reengineered and ported to French, English and Arabic. The context and objectives of our work are presented in the second section. The third section presents the IMRS original prototype and the possible strategies to achieve porting and personalization. In the fourth section, we give detailed specifications of our reengineered music retrieval system, IMRS-g. In the fifth section, we present the implementation of five music retrieval modes.

Each has associated grades (interpreted as &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot; below). For example, the component Happy-Sad is characterized by the seven grades: very happy, happy, a little happy, medium, a little sad, sad and very sad. In the original IMRS, these values always correspond to the integers in the [1, 7] interval, respectively 7.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0 and 1.0. A request to find a piece of music that gives a happy impression (happy) corresponds to the 10- dimensional vector as follows: (nil nil nil nil nil nil nil 6.0 nil nil) (Kumamoto, 2007), but the music pieces can be described by vectors having non-integer components. Although we had a quite precise description of the internal representation used by IMRS. We could not find information on the rest of the system. Hence, we recreated it to emulate the functions described in the original publications. That includes the system architecture, the design and implementation of the database, the management of requests, and the programming of actually much more than the originally proposed service.

In addition to the original design, where the NL expressions of the 10 measures are mapped in a fixed way to the integers in the real interval [1, 7], we have tried to apply a small part of the theory of fuzzy sets to improve the representation and evaluation of human perceptions. 3 Multilinguization of IMRS To port IMRS to several languages, we used the external porting method and we built a new content extractor, which treats simple utterances related to the music domain. 3.1 IMRS IMRS (Kumamoto and Ohta, 2003) is a nondeployed Web service prototype, developed as an experimental base for a PhD. It allows to retrieve music pieces either by using Japanese queries, or by manipulating a graphical interface with 10 criteria settable by knobs (speed, noise, rhythm...), and showing remarkable values (integers between 1 and 7) expressed by English labels. In IMRS, an utterance processed by the system is a spontaneous sentence or fragment of a sentence. The content extractor transforms it into a vector of 10 real numbers in the interval [1, 7].

The three possible strategies for linguistic porting are internal porting, external porting and porting by machine translation. Figure 2 shows an example of the car domain with the output of the content extractor (CRL-CATS). In CRL-CATS (Content Representation Language for CATS), a posted SMS is represented as a set of binary relations between objects. It is a kind of semantic graph with a UNL-like syntax (Uchida and Zhu 2005-2006). There are no variables, but the dictionary is used as a type lattice allowing specialization and generalization. Figure 2: Example of SMS 2.1 Internal porting The first possibility consists in adapting the original content extractor of the application from L1 to the target language L2 (see Figure 3); but that is viable only if : • the developers agree to open their code and tools, • the code and tools are relatively easy to understand, • the resources are not too heavy to create (in particular the dictionary).

Even if we agree that each term corresponds to an interval of length 1 centred on its reference value, e.g. [5.5, 6.5[ for happy, [6.5, 7.5] for very happy, etc., there are problems at the extremities. Therefore we studied the possibility of better modelling and better processing the requests by using fuzzy logic (Zadeh, 1965). In order to reason from imperfect knowledge, in contrast to classical logic, fuzzy logic proposes to replace the Boolean variables used in classical logic by fuzzy variables, and the classical crisp sets by fuzzy sets. Let U be a universe of elements. A fuzzy set A over U is defined by its membership function (fA). An element x of U is in A with a degree of membership fA(x) E [0, 1]. If fA(x) E {0, 1}, A reduces to a classic set, where x E A if fA(x)=1 and x 0 A if fA(x)=0 (fA is then simply the characteristic function of A). In a fuzzy set, an element x more or less belongs to the concept a</context>
