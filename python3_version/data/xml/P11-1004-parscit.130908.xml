This paper extends the training and tun-
ing regime for phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation to obtain fluent trans-
lations into morphologically complex lan-
guages (we build an English to Finnish
translation system). Our methods use
unsupervised morphology induction. Un-
like previous work we focus on morpho-
logically productive phrase pairs – our
decoder can combine morphemes across
phrase boundaries. Morphemes in the tar-
get language may not have a corresponding
morpheme or word in the source language.
Therefore, we propose a novel combina-
tion of post-processing morphology pre-
diction with morpheme-based translation.
We show, using both automatic evaluation
scores and linguistically motivated analy-
ses of the output, that our methods out-
perform previously proposed ones and pro-
vide the best known results on the English-
Finnish Europarl translation task. Our
methods are mostly language independent,
so they should improve translation into
other target languages with complex mor-
phology.

Languages with rich morphological systems
present significant hurdles for statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT), most notably data
sparsity, source-target asymmetry, and prob-
lems with automatic evaluation.
In this work, we propose to address the prob-
lem of morphological complexity in an English-
to-Finnish MT task within a phrase-based trans-
lation framework. We focus on unsupervised
segmentation methods to derive the morpholog-
ical information supplied to the MT model in
order to provide coverage on very large data-
sets and for languages with few hand-annotated

resources. In fact, in our experiments, unsuper-
vised morphology always outperforms the use
of a hand-built morphological analyzer. Rather
than focusing on a few linguistically motivated
aspects of Finnish morphological behaviour, we
develop techniques for handling morphological
complexity in general. We chose Finnish as our
target language for this work, because it ex-
emplifies many of the problems morphologically
complex languages present for SMT. Among all
the languages in the Europarl data-set, Finnish
is the most difficult language to translate from
and into, as was demonstrated in the MT Sum-
mit shared task (Koehn, 2005). Another reason
is the current lack of knowledge about how to ap-
ply SMT successfully to agglutinative languages
like Turkish or Finnish.
Our main contributions are: 1) the intro-
duction of the notion of segmented translation
where we explicitly allow phrase pairs that can
end with a dangling morpheme, which can con-
nect with other morphemes as part of the trans-
lation process, and 2) the use of a fully seg-
mented translation model in combination with
a post-processing morpheme prediction system,
using unsupervised morphology induction. Both
of these approaches beat the state of the art
on the English-Finnish translation task. Mor-
phology can express both content and function
categories, and our experiments show that it is
important to use morphology both within the
translation model (for morphology with content)
and outside it (for morphology contributing to
fluency).

method Unsup L-match.
After the segmentation, word-internal mor-
pheme boundary markers were inserted into
the segmented text to be used to reconstruct
the surface forms in the MT output. We
then trained the Moses phrase-based system
(Koehn et al., 2007) on the segmented and
marked text. After decoding, it was a sim-
ple matter to join together all adjacent mor-
phemes with word-internal boundary markers
to reconstruct the surface forms. Figure 1(a)
gives the full model overview for all the vari-
ants of the segmented translation model (super-
vised/unsupervised; with and without the Un-
sup L-match procedure).
Table 1 shows how morphemes are being used
in the MT system. Of the phrases that included
segmentations (‘Morph’ in Table 1), roughly a
third were ‘productive’, i.e. had a hanging mor-
pheme (with a form such as stem+) that could
be joined to a suffix (‘Hanging Morph’ in Ta-
ble 1). However, in phrases used while decoding
the development and test data, roughly a quar-
ter of the phrases that generated the translated
output included segmentations, but of these,
only a small fraction (6%) had a hanging mor-
pheme; and while there are many possible rea-
sons to account for this we were unable to find
a single convincing cause.

2.3 Morphology Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981457142857">
Morphology generation as a post-processing step
allows major vocabulary reduction in the trans-
lation model, and allows the use of morpholog-
ically targeted features for modeling inflection.
A possible disadvantage of this approach is that
in this model there is no opportunity to con-
sider the morphology in translation since it is
removed prior to training the translation model.
Morphology generation models can use a vari-
ety of bilingual and contextual information to
capture dependencies between morphemes, of-
ten more long-distance than what is possible us-
ing n-gram language models over morphemes in
the segmented model.
Similar to previous work (Minkov et al., 2007;
Toutanova et al., 2008), we model morphology
generation as a sequence learning problem. Un-
like previous work, we use unsupervised mor-
phology induction and use automatically gener-
ated suffix classes as tags. The first phase of our
morphology prediction model is to train a MT
system that produces morphologically simplified
word forms in the target language. The output
word forms are complex stems (a stem and some
suffixes) but still missing some important suffix
morphemes. In the second phase, the output of
the MT decoder is then tagged with a sequence
of abstract suffix tags. In particular, the out-
put of the MT decoder is a sequence of complex
stems denoted by x and the output is a sequence
of suffix class tags denoted by y. We use a list
of parts from (x,y) and map to a d-dimensional
feature vector 4b(x, y), with each dimension be-
ing a real number. We infer the best sequence
of tags using:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.88909">
F(x) = argmax p(y  |x, w)
y
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9956116">
where F(x) returns the highest scoring output
y*. A conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty
et al., 2001) defines the conditional probability
as a linear score for each candidate y and a global
normalization term:

<equation confidence="0.945425">

where Z = Ey1EGEN(x) exp(-b(x,y&apos;) · w). We
use stochastic gradient descent (using crfsgd3)
to train the weight vector w. So far, this is
all off-the-shelf sequence learning. However, the
output y* from the CRF decoder is still only a
sequence of abstract suffix tags. The third and

is to take the abstract suffix tag sequence y∗ and
then map it into fully inflected word forms, and
rank those outputs using a morphemic language
model. The abstract suffix tags are extracted
from the unsupervised morpheme learning pro-
cess, and are carefully designed to enable CRF
training and decoding. We call this model CRF-
LM for short. Figure 1(b) shows the full pipeline
and Figure 2 shows a worked example of all the
steps involved.
We use the morphologically segmented train-
ing data (obtained using the segmented corpus
described in Section 2.24) and remove selected
suffixes to create a morphologically simplified
version of the training data. The MT model is
trained on the morphologically simplified train-
ing data. The output from the MT system is
then used as input to the CRF model. The
CRF model was trained on a ∼210,000 Finnish
sentences, consisting of —1.5 million tokens; the
2,000 sentence Europarl test set consisted of
41,434 stem tokens. The labels in the output
sequence y were obtained by selecting the most
productive 150 stems, and then collapsing cer-
tain vowels into equivalence classes correspond-
ing to Finnish vowel harmony patterns. Thus
¢Note that unlike Section 2.2 we do not use Unsup
L-match because when evaluating the CRF model on the
suffix prediction task it obtained 95.61% without using
Unsup L-match and 82.99% when using Unsup L-match.
variants -ko and -ko become vowel-generic en-
clitic particle -kO, and variants -ssa and -ssa
become the vowel-generic inessive case marker
-ssA, etc. This is the only language-specific com-
ponent of our translation model. However, we
expect this approach to work for other agglu-
tinative languages as well. For fusional lan-
guages like Spanish, another mapping from suf-
fix to abstract tags might be needed. These suf-
fix transformations to their equivalence classes
prevent morphophonemic variants of the same
morpheme from competing against each other in
the prediction model. This resulted in 44 possi-
ble label outputs per stem which was a reason-
able sized tag-set for CRF training. The CRF
was trained on monolingual features of the seg-
mented text for suffix prediction, where t is the
current token:

With this simple feature set, we were able to
use features over longer distances, resulting in
a total of 1,110,075 model features. After CRF
based recovery of the suffix tag sequence, we use
a bigram language model trained on a full seg-
mented version on the training data to recover

cause the suffix vowel harmony alternation de-
pends only upon the preceding phonemes in the

3 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955709677419">
For all of the models built in this paper, we used
the Europarl version 3 corpus (Koehn, 2005)
English-Finnish training data set, as well as the
standard development and test data sets. Our
parallel training data consists of —1 million sen-
tences of 40 words or less, while the develop-
ment and test sets were each 2,000 sentences
long. In all the experiments conducted in this
paper, we used the Moses5 phrase-based trans-
lation system (Koehn et al., 2007), 2008 version.
We trained all of the Moses systems herein using
the standard features: language model, reorder-
ing model, translation model, and word penalty;
in addition to these, the factored experiments
called for additional translation and generation
features for the added factors as noted above.
We used in all experiments the following set-
tings: a hypothesis stack size 100, distortion
limit 6, phrase translations limit 20, and maxi-
mum phrase length 20. For the language models,
we used SRILM 5-gram language models (Stol-
cke, 2002) for all factors. For our word-based
Baseline system, we trained a word-based model
using the same Moses system with identical set-
tings. For evaluation against segmented trans-
lation systems in segmented forms before word
reconstruction, we also segmented the baseline
system’s word-based output. All the BLEU
scores reported are for lowercase evaluation.
We did an initial evaluation of the segmented
output translation for each system using the no-

3.1 Morphological Fluency Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999741625">
To see how well the models were doing at get-
ting morphology right, we examined several pat-
terns of morphological behavior. While we wish
to explore minimally supervised morphological
MT models, and use as little language spe-
cific information as possible, we do want to
use linguistic analysis on the output of our sys-
tem to see how well the models capture essen-
tial morphological information in the target lan-
guage. So, we ran the word-based baseline sys-
tem, the segmented model (Unsup L-match),
and the prediction model (CRF-LM) outputs,
along with the reference translation through the
supervised morphological analyzer Omorfi (Piri-
nen and Listenmaa, 2007). Using this analy-
sis, we looked at a variety of linguistic construc-
tions that might reveal patterns in morphologi-
cal behavior. These were: (a) explicitly marked
noun forms, (b) noun-adjective case agreement,
(c) subject-verb person/number agreement, (d)
transitive object case marking, (e) postposi-
tions, and (f) possession. In each of these cat-
egories, we looked for construction matches on
a per-sentence level between the models’ output
and the reference translation.
Table 4 shows the models’ performance on the
constructions we examined. In all of the cat-
egories, the CRF-LM model achieves the best
precision score, as we explain below, while the
Unsup L-match model most frequently gets the
highest recall score.
A general pattern in the most prevalent of
these constructions is that the baseline tends
to prefer the least marked form for noun cases
(corresponding to the nominative) more than
the reference or the CRF-LM model. The base-
line leaves nouns in the (unmarked) nominative
far more than the reference, while the CRF-LM
model comes much closer, so it seems to fare
better at explicitly marking forms, rather than
defaulting to the more frequent unmarked form.
Finnish adjectives must be marked with the
same case as their head noun, while verbs must
agree in person and number with their subject.
We saw that in both these categories, the CRF-
LM model outperforms for precision, while the
segmented model gets the best recall.
In addition, Finnish generally marks di-
rect objects of verbs with the accusative
or the partitive case; we observed more
accusative/partitive-marked nouns following
verbs in the CRF-LM output than in the base-
line, as illustrated by example (1) in Fig. 3.
While neither translation picks the same verb as
in the reference for the input ‘clarify,’ the CRF-
LM-output paraphrases it by using a grammat-
ical construction of the transitive verb followed
by a noun phrase inflected with the accusative
case, correctly capturing the transitive construc-
tion. The baseline translation instead follows
‘give’ with a direct object in the nominative
case.
To help clarify the constructions in question,

translations of our MT output into English; to
contextualize these back-translations, we have
provided Google&apos;s back-translation of the refer-
ence.
The use of postpositions shows another dif-
ference between the models. Finnish postposi-
tions require the preceding noun to be in the
genitive or sometimes partitive case, which oc-
curs correctly more frequently in the CRF-LM
than the baseline. In example (2) in Fig. 3,
all three translations correspond to the English
text, ‘with the basque nationalists.’ However,
the CRF-LM output is more grammatical than
the baseline, because not only do the adjective
and noun agree for case, but the noun ‘bask-
ien&apos; to which the postposition `kanssa&apos; belongs is
marked with the correct genitive case. However,
this well-formedness is not rewarded by BLEU,
because `baskien&apos; does not match the reference.
In addition, while Finnish may express pos-
session using case marking alone, it has another
construction for possession; this can disam-
biguate an otherwise ambiguous clause. This al-
ternate construction uses a pronoun in the geni-
tive case followed by a possessive-marked noun;
we see that the CRF-LM model correctly marks
this construction more frequently than the base-
line. As example (3) in Fig. 3 shows, while nei-
ther model correctly translates `matkan&apos; (‘trip’),
the baseline’s output attributes the inessive
`yhteydess&apos; (‘connection’) as belonging to `tu-
lokset&apos; (‘results’), and misses marking the pos-
session linking it to ‘Commissioner Fischler’.
Our manual evaluation shows that the CRF-
LM model is producing output translations that
are more morphologically fluent than the word-
based baseline and the segmented translation
Unsup L-match system, even though the word
choices lead to a lower BLEU score overall when
compared to Unsup L-match.

The work on morphology in MT can be grouped
into three categories, factored models, seg-
mented translation, and morphology generation.
Factored models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007)
factor the phrase translation probabilities over
additional information annotated to each word,
allowing for text to be represented on multi-
ple levels of analysis. We discussed the draw-
backs of factored models for our task in Sec-
tion 2.1. While (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Yang
and Kirchhoff, 2006; Avramidis and Koehn,
2008) obtain improvements using factored mod-
els for translation into English, German, Span-
ish, and Czech, these models may be less useful
for capturing long-distance dependencies in lan-
guages with much more complex morphological
systems such as Finnish. In our experiments
factored models did worse than the baseline.
Segmented translation performs morphologi-
cal analysis on the morphologically complex text
for use in the translation model (Brown et al.,
1993; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; de Gis-
pert and Marino, 2008). This method unpacks
complex forms into simpler, more frequently oc-
curring components, and may also increase the
symmetry of the lexically realized content be-

tween source and target. In a somewhat or-
thogonal approach to ours, (Ma et al., 2007) use
alignment of a parallel text to pack together ad-
jacent segments in the alignment output, which
are then fed back to the word aligner to boot-
strap an improved alignment, which is then used
in the translation model. We compared our re-
sults against (Luong et al., 2010) in Table 3
since their results are directly comparable to
ours. They use a segmented phrase table and
language model along with the word-based ver-
sions in the decoder and in tuning a Finnish tar-
get. Their approach requires segmented phrases
to match word boundaries, eliminating morpho-
logically productive phrases. In their work a seg-
mented language model can score a translation,
but cannot insert morphology that does not
show source-side reflexes. In order to perform
a similar experiment that still allowed for mor-
phologically productive phrases, we tried train-
ing a segmented translation model, the output
of which we stitched up in tuning so as to tune
to a word-based reference. The goal of this ex-
periment was to control the segmented model’s
tendency to overfit by rewarding it for using
correct whole-word forms. However, we found

that this approach was less successful than us-
ing the segmented reference in tuning, and could
not meet the baseline (13.97% BLEU best tun-
ing score, versus 14.93% BLEU for the base-
line best tuning score). Previous work in seg-
mented translation has often used linguistically
motivated morphological analysis selectively ap-
plied based on a language-specific heuristic. A
typical approach is to select a highly inflecting
class of words and segment them for particular
morphology (de Gispert and Marino, 2008; Ra-
manathan et al., 2009). Popoviq and Ney (2004)
perform segmentation to reduce morphological
complexity of the source to translate into an iso-
lating target, reducing the translation error rate
for the English target. For Czech-to-English,
Goldwater and McClosky (2005) lemmatized the
source text and inserted a set of `pseudowords&apos;
expected to have lexical reflexes in English.
Minkov et. al. (2007) and Toutanova et. al.
(2008) use a Maximum Entropy Markov Model
for morphology generation. The main draw-
back to this approach is that it removes morpho-
logical information from the translation model
(which only uses stems); this can be a prob-
lem for languages in which morphology ex-
presses lexical content. de Gispert (2008) uses
a language-specific targeted morphological clas-
sifier for Spanish verbs to avoid this issue. Tal-
bot and Osborne (2006) use clustering to group
morphological variants of words for word align-
ments and for smoothing phrase translation ta-
bles. Habash (2007) provides various methods
to incorporate morphological variants of words
in the phrase table in order to help recognize out
of vocabulary words in the source language.

We found that using a segmented translation
model based on unsupervised morphology in-
duction and a model that combined morpheme
segments in the translation model with a post-
processing morphology prediction model gave us
better BLEU scores than a word-based baseline.
Using our proposed approach we obtain better
scores than the state of the art on the English-
Finnish translation task (Luong et al., 2010):
from 14.82% BLEU to 15.09%, while using a
simpler model. We show that using morpho-
logical segmentation in the translation model
can improve output translation scores. We
also demonstrate that for Finnish (and possi-
bly other agglutinative languages), phrase-based
MT benefits from allowing the translation model
access to morphological segmentation yielding
productive morphological phrases. Taking ad-
vantage of linguistic analysis of the output we
show that using a post-processing morphology
generation model can improve translation flu-
ency on a sub-word level, in a manner that is
not captured by the BLEU word-based evalua-
tion measure.
In order to help with replication of the results
in this paper, we have run the various morpho-
logical analysis steps and created the necessary
training, tuning and test data files needed in or-
der to train, tune and test any phrase-based ma-
chine translation system with our data. The files
can be downloaded from natlang.cs.sfu.ca.
In future work we hope to explore the utility of
phrases with productive morpheme boundaries
and explore why they are not used more per-
vasively in the decoder. Evaluation measures
for morphologically complex languages and tun-
ing to those measures are also important future
work directions. Also, we would like to explore
a non-pipelined approach to morphological pre-
and post-processing so that a globally trained
model could be used to remove the target side
morphemes that would improve the translation
model and then predict those morphemes in the
target language.

<abstract confidence="0.988193737837839">This paper extends the training and tuning regime for phrase-based statistical machine translation to obtain fluent transcomplex languages (we build an English to Finnish translation system). Our methods use unsupervised morphology induction. Unlike previous work we focus on morphologically productive phrase pairs – our decoder can combine morphemes across phrase boundaries. Morphemes in the target language may not have a corresponding morpheme or word in the source language. Therefore, we propose a novel combination of post-processing morphology prediction with morpheme-based translation. We show, using both automatic evaluation scores and linguistically motivated analyses of the output, that our methods outperform previously proposed ones and provide the best known results on the English- Finnish Europarl translation task. Our methods are mostly language independent, so they should improve translation into other target languages with complex morphology. 1 Translation and Morphology Languages with rich morphological systems present significant hurdles for statistical machine translation (SMT), most notably data sparsity, source-target asymmetry, and problems with automatic evaluation. In this work, we propose to address the problem of morphological complexity in an Englishto-Finnish MT task within a phrase-based translation framework. We focus on unsupervised segmentation methods to derive the morphological information supplied to the MT model in order to provide coverage on very large datasets and for languages with few hand-annotated 32 resources. In fact, in our experiments, unsupervised morphology always outperforms the use of a hand-built morphological analyzer. Rather than focusing on a few linguistically motivated aspects of Finnish morphological behaviour, we develop techniques for handling morphological complexity in general. We chose Finnish as our target language for this work, because it exemplifies many of the problems morphologically complex languages present for SMT. Among all the languages in the Europarl data-set, Finnish is the most difficult language to translate from and into, as was demonstrated in the MT Summit shared task (Koehn, 2005). Another reason is the current lack of knowledge about how to apply SMT successfully to agglutinative languages like Turkish or Finnish. Our main contributions are: 1) the introduction of the notion of segmented translation where we explicitly allow phrase pairs that can end with a dangling morpheme, which can connect with other morphemes as part of the translation process, and 2) the use of a fully segmented translation model in combination with a post-processing morpheme prediction system, using unsupervised morphology induction. Both of these approaches beat the state of the art on the English-Finnish translation task. Morphology can express both content and function categories, and our experiments show that it is important to use morphology both within the translation model (for morphology with content) and outside it (for morphology contributing to fluency). Automatic evaluation measures for MT, et al., 2002), Rate) and Independent Word Error Rate) use the word as the basic rather than morphemes. In a word comof the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational pages 32–42, Oregon, June 19-24, 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics prised of multiple morphemes, getting even a single morpheme wrong means the entire word is wrong. In addition to standard MT evaluation measures, we perform a detailed linguistic anal-ysis of the output. Our proposed approaches are significantly better than the state of the art, the highest reported on the English-Finnish Europarl version 3 data-set. Our linguistic analysis shows that our models have fewer morpho-syntactic errors compared to the word-based baseline. performance of unsupervised segmentation for translation, our third baseline is a segmented translation model based on a supervised segmen-tation model (called Sup), using the hand-built Omorfi morphological analyzer (Pirinen and Lis-tenmaa, 2007), which provided slightly higher BLEU scores than the word-based baseline. 2 Models 2.2 Segmented Translation 2.1 Baseline Models For segmented translation models, it cannot be taken for granted that greater linguistic accu-racy in segmentation yields improved transla-tion (Chang et al., 2008). Rather, the goal in segmentation for translation is instead to maxi-mize the amount of lexical content-carrying mor-phology, while generalizing over the information not helpful for improving the translation model. We therefore trained several different segmenta-tion models, considering factors of granularity, coverage, and source-target symmetry. We set up three baseline models for compari-son in this work. The first is a basic word-based model (called Baseline in the results); we trained this on the original unsegmented version of the text. Our second baseline is a factored translation model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) (called Factored), which used as factors word, and suffix. These are de-rived from the same unsupervised segmenta-tion model used in other experiments. The re-sults (Table 3) show that a factored model was unable to match the scores of a simple word-based baseline. We hypothesize that this may be an inherently difficult representational form for a language with the degree of morphologi-cal complexity found in Finnish. Because the morphology generation must be precomputed, for languages with a high degree of morpho-logical complexity, the combinatorial explosion makes it unmanageable to capture the full range of morphological productivity. In addition, be-cause the morphological variants are generated on a per-word basis within a given phrase, it excludes productive morphological combination across phrase boundaries and makes it impossi-ble for the model to take into account any long-distance dependencies between morphemes. We conclude from this result that it may be more useful for an agglutinative language to use mor-phology beyond the confines of the phrasal unit, and condition its generation on more than just the local target stem. In order to compare the We performed unsupervised segmentation of the target data, using Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) and Paramor (Monson, 2008), two top systems from the Morpho Challenge 2008 (their combined output was the Morpho Chal-lenge winner). However, translation models based upon either Paramor alone or the com-bined systems output could not match the word-based baseline, so we concentrated on Morfes-sor. Morfessor uses minimum description length criteria to train a HMM-based segmentation model. When tested against a human-annotated gold standard of linguistic morpheme segmen-tations for Finnish, this algorithm outperforms competing unsupervised methods, achieving an F-score of 67.0% on a 3 million sentence cor-pus (Creutz and Lagus, 2006). Varying the per-plexity threshold in Morfessor does not segment more word types, but rather over-segments the same word types. In order to get robust, com-mon segmentations, we trained the segmenter the 5000 most frequent we then used this to segment the entire data set. In order to improve coverage, we then further segmented the factored model baseline we also used the setting 30, 5,000 most frequent words, but with all but the last suffix collapsed and called the “stem”.

We call this method Unsup L-match. After the segmentation, word-internal morpheme boundary markers were inserted into the segmented text to be used to reconstruct the surface forms in the MT output. We then trained the Moses phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2007) on the segmented and marked text. After decoding, it was a simple matter to join together all adjacent morphemes with word-internal boundary markers to reconstruct the surface forms. Figure 1(a) gives the full model overview for all the variants of the segmented translation model (supervised/unsupervised; with and without the Unsup L-match procedure). Table 1 shows how morphemes are being used in the MT system. Of the phrases that included segmentations (‘Morph’ in Table 1), roughly a third were ‘productive’, i.e. had a hanging mor- (with a form such as that could be joined to a suffix (‘Hanging Morph’ in Table 1). However, in phrases used while decoding the development and test data, roughly a quarter of the phrases that generated the translated output included segmentations, but of these, only a small fraction (6%) had a hanging morpheme; and while there are many possible reasons to account for this we were unable to find a single convincing cause. 2.3 Morphology Generation Morphology generation as a post-processing step allows major vocabulary reduction in the translation model, and allows the use of morphologically targeted features for modeling inflection. A possible disadvantage of this approach is that this model there is no opportunity to consider the morphology in translation since it is removed prior to training the translation model. Morphology generation models can use a variety of bilingual and contextual information to capture dependencies between morphemes, often more long-distance than what is possible uslanguage models over morphemes in the segmented model. Similar to previous work (Minkov et al., 2007; Toutanova et al., 2008), we model morphology generation as a sequence learning problem. Unlike previous work, we use unsupervised morphology induction and use automatically generated suffix classes as tags. The first phase of our morphology prediction model is to train a MT system that produces morphologically simplified word forms in the target language. The output word forms are complex stems (a stem and some suffixes) but still missing some important suffix morphemes. In the second phase, the output of the MT decoder is then tagged with a sequence of abstract suffix tags. In particular, the output of the MT decoder is a sequence of complex denoted by the output is a sequence suffix class tags denoted by We use a list parts from and map to a vector with each dimension being a real number. We infer the best sequence of tags using: = argmax | y returns the highest scoring output A random field (Lafferty et al., 2001) defines the conditional probability a linear score for each candidate a normalization term:  |= We stochastic gradient descent (using train the weight vector far, this is all off-the-shelf sequence learning. However, the from the CRF decoder is still only a sequence of abstract suffix tags.

The abstract suffix tags are extracted from the unsupervised morpheme learning process, and are carefully designed to enable CRF training and decoding. We call this model CRF- LM for short. Figure 1(b) shows the full pipeline and Figure 2 shows a worked example of all the steps involved. We use the morphologically segmented training data (obtained using the segmented corpus in Section and remove selected suffixes to create a morphologically simplified version of the training data. The MT model is trained on the morphologically simplified training data. The output from the MT system is then used as input to the CRF model. The model was trained on a Finnish consisting of million tokens; the 2,000 sentence Europarl test set consisted of 41,434 stem tokens. The labels in the output obtained by selecting the most productive 150 stems, and then collapsing certain vowels into equivalence classes corresponding to Finnish vowel harmony patterns. Thus that unlike Section 2.2 we do not use Unsup L-match because when evaluating the CRF model on the suffix prediction task it obtained 95.61% without using Unsup L-match and 82.99% when using Unsup L-match. variants -ko and -ko become vowel-generic enclitic particle -kO, and variants -ssa and -ssa become the vowel-generic inessive case marker -ssA, etc. This is the only language-specific component of our translation model. However, we expect this approach to work for other agglutinative languages as well. For fusional languages like Spanish, another mapping from suffix to abstract tags might be needed. These suffix transformations to their equivalence classes prevent morphophonemic variants of the same morpheme from competing against each other in the prediction model. This resulted in 44 possible label outputs per stem which was a reasonable sized tag-set for CRF training. The CRF was trained on monolingual features of the segtext for suffix prediction, where the current token: Stem .., .., 4) Prediction With this simple feature set, we were able to use features over longer distances, resulting in a total of 1,110,075 model features. After CRF based recovery of the suffix tag sequence, we use a bigram language model trained on a full segmented version on the training data to recover the original vowels. We used bigrams only, because the suffix vowel harmony alternation depends only upon the preceding phonemes in the word from which it was segmented. 35 training koskevaa mietintoa kasitellaan koske+ +va+ +a mietinto+ +a kasi+ +te+ +lla+ +a+ +n bigram language model with mapping A = a� final to abstract koske+ +va+ +A mietinto+ +A kasi+ +te+ +lla+ +a+ +n (train CRF model to predict the final suffix) of final koske+ +va+ mietinto+ kasi+ +te+ +lla+ +a+ (train SMT model on this transformation of training data) (a) Training koske+ +va+ mietinto+ kasi+ +te+ +lla+ +a+ output stitched koskeva+ mietinto+ kasitellm+ model `koskeva+ mietinto+ kasitellaa+&apos;, `+A +A +n&apos; koskeva+ +A mietinto+ +A kasitellm+ +n koske+ +va+ +A mietinto+ +A kasi+ +te+ +lla+ +a+ +n model koske+ +va+ +a mietinto+ +a kasi+ +te+ +lla+ +a+ +n koskevaa mietintoa kasitellaan (the output is then compared to the reference translation) (b) Decoding Figure 2: Worked example of all steps in the post-processing morphology prediction model. 3 Experimental Results For all of the models built in this paper, we used the Europarl version 3 corpus (Koehn, 2005) English-Finnish training data set, as well as the standard development and test data sets. Our training data consists of million sentences of 40 words or less, while the development and test sets were each 2,000 sentences long. In all the experiments conducted in this we used the translation system (Koehn et al., 2007), 2008 version. We trained all of the Moses systems herein using the standard features: language model, reordering model, translation model, and word penalty; in addition to these, the factored experiments called for additional translation and generation features for the added factors as noted above. We used in all experiments the following settings: a hypothesis stack size 100, distortion limit 6, phrase translations limit 20, and maximum phrase length 20. For the language models, we used SRILM 5-gram language models (Stolcke, 2002) for all factors. For our word-based Baseline system, we trained a word-based model using the same Moses system with identical settings. For evaluation against segmented translation systems in segmented forms before word reconstruction, we also segmented the baseline system’s word-based output. All the BLEU scores reported are for lowercase evaluation. We did an initial evaluation of the segmented translation for each system using the no- Segmentation No Uni Baseline 9.89 Sup 13.49 Unsup L-match 15.89 Table 2: Segmented Model Scores.

We also show the score without unigrams, since over-segmentation lead to artificially high scores.

(2010) report score of 55.64% but obtain a relative improvement of 0.6% over their baseline score. We find that when using a good segmentation model, segmentation of the morphologically complex target language improves model performance over an unsegmented baseline (the confidence scores come from bootstrap resampling).

Our best performing method used unsupervised morphology with (see Section 2.2) and the improvement is significant: bootstrap resampling provides a margin of and a (Collins al., 2005) showed significance with 3.1 Morphological Fluency Analysis To see how well the models were doing at getting morphology right, we examined several patterns of morphological behavior. While we wish to explore minimally supervised morphological MT models, and use as little language specific information as possible, we do want to use linguistic analysis on the output of our system to see how well the models capture essential morphological information in the target language. So, we ran the word-based baseline system, the segmented model (Unsup L-match), and the prediction model (CRF-LM) outputs, along with the reference translation through the supervised morphological analyzer Omorfi (Pirinen and Listenmaa, 2007). Using this analysis, we looked at a variety of linguistic constructions that might reveal patterns in morphological behavior. These were: (a) explicitly marked noun forms, (b) noun-adjective case agreement, (c) subject-verb person/number agreement, (d) transitive object case marking, (e) postpositions, and (f) possession. In each of these categories, we looked for construction matches on a per-sentence level between the models’ output and the reference translation. Table 4 shows the models’ performance on the constructions we examined. In all of the categories, the CRF-LM model achieves the best precision score, as we explain below, while the Unsup L-match model most frequently gets the highest recall score. A general pattern in the most prevalent of these constructions is that the baseline tends to prefer the least marked form for noun cases (corresponding to the nominative) more than the reference or the CRF-LM model. The baseline leaves nouns in the (unmarked) nominative far more than the reference, while the CRF-LM model comes much closer, so it seems to fare better at explicitly marking forms, rather than defaulting to the more frequent unmarked form. Finnish adjectives must be marked with the same case as their head noun, while verbs must agree in person and number with their subject. We saw that in both these categories, the CRF- LM model outperforms for precision, while the segmented model gets the best recall. In addition, Finnish generally marks direct objects of verbs with the accusative or the partitive case; we observed more accusative/partitive-marked nouns following verbs in the CRF-LM output than in the baseline, as illustrated by example (1) in Fig. 3. While neither translation picks the same verb as in the reference for the input ‘clarify,’ the CRF- LM-output paraphrases it by using a grammatical construction of the transitive verb followed by a noun phrase inflected with the accusative case, correctly capturing the transitive construction. The baseline translation instead follows ‘give’ with a direct object in the nominative case. To help clarify the constructions in question, have used Google to provide back- 37</abstract>

The highlighted value in each column is the most accurate with respect to the reference value. translations of our MT output into English; to contextualize these back-translations, we have provided Google&apos;s back-translation of the reference. The use of postpositions shows another difference between the models. Finnish postpositions require the preceding noun to be in the genitive or sometimes partitive case, which occurs correctly more frequently in the CRF-LM than the baseline. In example (2) in Fig. 3, all three translations correspond to the English text, ‘with the basque nationalists.’ However, the CRF-LM output is more grammatical than the baseline, because not only do the adjective and noun agree for case, but the noun ‘baskien&apos; to which the postposition `kanssa&apos; belongs is marked with the correct genitive case. However, this well-formedness is not rewarded by BLEU, because `baskien&apos; does not match the reference. In addition, while Finnish may express possession using case marking alone, it has another construction for possession; this can disambiguate an otherwise ambiguous clause. This alternate construction uses a pronoun in the genitive case followed by a possessive-marked noun; we see that the CRF-LM model correctly marks this construction more frequently than the baseline. As example (3) in Fig. 3 shows, while neither model correctly translates `matkan&apos; (‘trip’), the baseline’s output attributes the inessive `yhteydess&apos; (‘connection’) as belonging to `tulokset&apos; (‘results’), and misses marking the possession linking it to ‘Commissioner Fischler’. Our manual evaluation shows that the CRF- LM model is producing output translations that are more morphologically fluent than the wordbased baseline and the segmented translation Unsup L-match system, even though the word choices lead to a lower BLEU score overall when compared to Unsup L-match. 4 Related Work The work on morphology in MT can be grouped into three categories, factored models, segmented translation, and morphology generation. Factored models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) factor the phrase translation probabilities over additional information annotated to each word, allowing for text to be represented on multiple levels of analysis. We discussed the drawbacks of factored models for our task in Section 2.1. While (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Avramidis and Koehn, 2008) obtain improvements using factored models for translation into English, German, Spanish, and Czech, these models may be less useful for capturing long-distance dependencies in languages with much more complex morphological systems such as Finnish. In our experiments factored models did worse than the baseline. Segmented translation performs morphological analysis on the morphologically complex text for use in the translation model (Brown et al., 1993; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; de Gispert and Marino, 2008). This method unpacks complex forms into simpler, more frequently occurring components, and may also increase the of the lexically realized content be- 38 (1) Input: ‘the charter we are to approve today both strengthens and gives visible shape to the common fundamental rights and values our community is to be based upon.’ Reference: perusoikeuskirja , jonka tanMn aiomme hyvaksya , seka vahvistaa etta (selyhteisia perusoikeuksia ja arvoja , joiden on oltava yhteisomme perusta.

In a somewhat orthogonal approach to ours, (Ma et al., 2007) use alignment of a parallel text to pack together adjacent segments in the alignment output, which are then fed back to the word aligner to bootstrap an improved alignment, which is then used in the translation model. We compared our results against (Luong et al., 2010) in Table 3 since their results are directly comparable to ours. They use a segmented phrase table and language model along with the word-based versions in the decoder and in tuning a Finnish target. Their approach requires segmented phrases to match word boundaries, eliminating morphologically productive phrases. In their work a segmented language model can score a translation, but cannot insert morphology that does not show source-side reflexes. In order to perform a similar experiment that still allowed for morphologically productive phrases, we tried training a segmented translation model, the output of which we stitched up in tuning so as to tune to a word-based reference. The goal of this experiment was to control the segmented model’s tendency to overfit by rewarding it for using correct whole-word forms. However, we found 39 that this approach was less successful than using the segmented reference in tuning, and could not meet the baseline (13.97% BLEU best tuning score, versus 14.93% BLEU for the baseline best tuning score). Previous work in segmented translation has often used linguistically motivated morphological analysis selectively applied based on a language-specific heuristic. A typical approach is to select a highly inflecting class of words and segment them for particular morphology (de Gispert and Marino, 2008; Ramanathan et al., 2009). Popoviq and Ney (2004) perform segmentation to reduce morphological complexity of the source to translate into an isolating target, reducing the translation error rate for the English target. For Czech-to-English, Goldwater and McClosky (2005) lemmatized the source text and inserted a set of `pseudowords&apos; expected to have lexical reflexes in English. Minkov et. al. (2007) and Toutanova et. al. (2008) use a Maximum Entropy Markov Model for morphology generation. The main drawback to this approach is that it removes morphological information from the translation model (which only uses stems); this can be a problem for languages in which morphology expresses lexical content. de Gispert (2008) uses a language-specific targeted morphological classifier for Spanish verbs to avoid this issue. Talbot and Osborne (2006) use clustering to group morphological variants of words for word alignments and for smoothing phrase translation tables. Habash (2007) provides various methods to incorporate morphological variants of words in the phrase table in order to help recognize out of vocabulary words in the source language. 5 Conclusion and Future Work We found that using a segmented translation model based on unsupervised morphology induction and a model that combined morpheme segments in the translation model with a postprocessing morphology prediction model gave us better BLEU scores than a word-based baseline. Using our proposed approach we obtain better scores than the state of the art on the English- Finnish translation task (Luong et al., 2010): from 14.82% BLEU to 15.09%, while using a simpler model. We show that using morphological segmentation in the translation model can improve output translation scores. We also demonstrate that for Finnish (and possibly other agglutinative languages), phrase-based MT benefits from allowing the translation model access to morphological segmentation yielding productive morphological phrases. Taking advantage of linguistic analysis of the output we show that using a post-processing morphology generation model can improve translation fluency on a sub-word level, in a manner that is not captured by the BLEU word-based evaluation measure. In order to help with replication of the results in this paper, we have run the various morphological analysis steps and created the necessary training, tuning and test data files needed in order to train, tune and test any phrase-based machine translation system with our data. The files be downloaded from In future work we hope to explore the utility of phrases with productive morpheme boundaries and explore why they are not used more pervasively in the decoder. Evaluation measures for morphologically complex languages and tuning to those measures are also important future work directions. Also, we would like to explore a non-pipelined approach to morphological preand post-processing so that a globally trained model could be used to remove the target side morphemes that would improve the translation model and then predict those morphemes in the target language.</abstract>

Our best performing method used unsupervised morphology with L-match (see Section 2.2) and the improvement is significant: bootstrap resampling provides a confidence margin of ±0.77 and a t-test (Collins et al., 2005) showed significance with p = 0.001. 3.1 Morphological Fluency Analysis To see how well the models were doing at getting morphology right, we examined several patterns of morphological behavior. While we wish to explore minimally supervised morphological MT models, and use as little language specific information as possible, we do want to use linguistic analysis on the output of our system to see how well the models capture essential morphological information in the target language. So, we ran the word-based baseline system, the segmented model (Unsup L-match), and the prediction model (CRF-LM</context>

Previous work in segmented translation has often used linguistically motivated morphological analysis selectively applied based on a language-specific heuristic. A typical approach is to select a highly inflecting class of words and segment them for particular morphology (de Gispert and Marino, 2008; Ramanathan et al., 2009). Popoviq and Ney (2004) perform segmentation to reduce morphological complexity of the source to translate into an isolating target, reducing the translation error rate for the English target. For Czech-to-English, Goldwater and McClosky (2005) lemmatized the source text and inserted a set of `pseudowords&apos; expected to have lexical reflexes in English. Minkov et. al. (2007) and Toutanova et. al. (2008) use a Maximum Entropy Markov Model for morphology generation. The main drawback to this approach is that it removes morphological information from the translation model (which only uses stems); this can be a problem for languages in which morphology expresses lexical content. de Gispert (2008) uses a language-specific targeted morphological classifier for Spanish verbs to avoid this issue.

We then trained the Moses phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2007) on the segmented and marked text. After decoding, it was a simple matter to join together all adjacent morphemes with word-internal boundary markers to reconstruct the surface forms. Figure 1(a) gives the full model overview for all the variants of the segmented translation model (supervised/unsupervised; with and without the Unsup L-match procedure).

Rather than focusing on a few linguistically motivated aspects of Finnish morphological behaviour, we develop techniques for handling morphological complexity in general. We chose Finnish as our target language for this work, because it exemplifies many of the problems morphologically complex languages present for SMT. Among all the languages in the Europarl data-set, Finnish is the most difficult language to translate from and into, as was demonstrated in the MT Summit shared task (Koehn, 2005). Another reason is the current lack of knowledge about how to apply SMT successfully to agglutinative languages like Turkish or Finnish. Our main contributions are: 1) the introduction of the notion of segmented translation where we explicitly allow phrase pairs that can end with a dangling morpheme, which can connect with other morphemes as part of the translation process, and 2) the use of a fully segmented translation model in combination with a post-processing morpheme prediction system, using unsupervised morphology induction.

In the second phase, the output of the MT decoder is then tagged with a sequence of abstract suffix tags. In particular, the output of the MT decoder is a sequence of complex stems denoted by x and the output is a sequence of suffix class tags denoted by y. We use a list of parts from (x,y) and map to a d-dimensional feature vector 4b(x, y), with each dimension being a real number. We infer the best sequence of tags using: F(x) = argmax p(y |x, w) y where F(x) returns the highest scoring output y*. A conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) defines the conditional probability as a linear score for each candidate y and a global normalization term: logp(y |x, w) = -b(x, y) · w − log Z where Z = Ey1EGEN(x) exp(-b(x,y&apos;) · w). We use stochastic gradient descent (using crfsgd3) to train the weight vector w. So far, this is all off-the-shelf sequence learning.

Morphology generation models can use a variety of bilingual and contextual information to capture dependencies between morphemes, often more long-distance than what is possible using n-gram language models over morphemes in the segmented model. Similar to previous work (Minkov et al., 2007; Toutanova et al., 2008), we model morphology generation as a sequence learning problem. Unlike previous work, we use unsupervised morphology induction and use automatically generated suffix classes as tags. The first phase of our morphology prediction model is to train a MT system that produces morphologically simplified word forms in the target language.

So, we ran the word-based baseline system, the segmented model (Unsup L-match), and the prediction model (CRF-LM) outputs, along with the reference translation through the supervised morphological analyzer Omorfi (Pirinen and Listenmaa, 2007). Using this analysis, we looked at a variety of linguistic constructions that might reveal patterns in morphological behavior. These were: (a) explicitly marked noun forms, (b) noun-adjective case agreement, (c) subject-verb person/number agreement, (d) transitive object case marking, (e) postpositions, and (f) possession.

Factored models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) factor the phrase translation probabilities over additional information annotated to each word, allowing for text to be represented on multiple levels of analysis. We discussed the drawbacks of factored models for our task in Section 2.1. While (Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Avramidis and Koehn, 2008) obtain improvements using factored models for translation into English, German, Spanish, and Czech, these models may be less useful for capturing long-distance dependencies in languages with much more complex morphological systems such as Finnish. In our experiments factored models did worse than the baseline. Segmented translation performs morphological analysis on the morphologically complex text for use in the translation model (Brown et al., 1993; Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; de Gispert and Marino, 2008).
