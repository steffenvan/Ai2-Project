Theoretical research in the area of machine translation usu-
ally involves the search for and creation of an appropriate
formalism. An important issue in this respect is the way in
which the compositionality of translation is to be defined.
In this paper, we will introduce the anaphoric component
of the Mimo formalism. It makes the definition and trans-
lation of anaphoric relations possible, relations which are
usually problematic for systems that adhere to strict com-
positionality. In Mimo, the translation of anaphoric rela-
tions is compositional. The anaphoric component is used
to define linguistic phenomena such as wh-movement, the
passive and the binding of reflexives and pronouns mono-
lingually. The actual working of the component will be
shown in this paper by means of a detailed discussion of
wh-movement.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999952157894737">
Theoretical research as part of machine translation often
aims at finding an appropriate formalism. One of the main
issues involved is whether the formalism does full justice
to the idea that the translation of a whole is built from
the translation of its parts on the one hand and whether
it leaves enough room for the treatment of exceptions on
the other hand. In other words, the question is in what
way the idea of compositionality is to be defined within
a particular formalism. An answer to this question from
an interlingual perspective is given in the literature on the
Rosetta system (e.g. Landsbergen 1985). The CAT frame
work (e.g. Arnold et al. 1986) was meant to be an an
swer to the same question, this time for a transfer system
viz. the Eurotra system. The MiMo formalism is a re
action to the CAT framework and tries to solve severs
translation problems by formulating an alternative defini
tion of compositionality. Phenomena involving anaphor
1 such as wh-movement and the coindexation of pronomi
nals often cause problems for strictly compositional system
since translation of one word depends on (the translatioi
of) another word, one which can be quite far away in thl
sentence. Rosetta tackles this problem by distinguishini
between rules that are significant with respect to the corn
positionality of translation, so-called meaningful rules, am
rules that are not, referred to as transformations (Appel■
et al. 1987); in this way the system is not compositional ii
the strict sense anymore. The notion of compositionalit:
MiMo adheres to is defined in such a way that anaphoril
relations can be translated compositionally as well. In thi
paper we will introduce the anaphoric component of till
MiMo formalism. It is used to define linguistic phenomeni
such as wh-movement, the binding of reflexives and pro
nouns, the passive and control phenomena monolingually
The formalism will be discussed by means of an extensiv,
description of a possible analysis of wh-movement.
In the next section, we will first discuss and motivate som
of the more fundamental characteristics of the MiMo trans
lation system. Section two will sketch the MiMo formalisn

as far as necessary for understanding what will follow. The
component that deals with the treatment of anaphora will
be discussed in section 3. In the fourth section the ac-
tual working of the component will be shown by an elab-
orate discussion of wh-movement. Finally, the translation
of anaphoric relations will be defined and some idea will
be given of the kind of problems that remain and that will

The MiMo formalism tries to come up with an answer to
the question what compositional translation should imply.
Strictly compositional systems have to deal with several
translation problems. As to what these problems exactly
are depends on the nature of the definition of the notion
compositionality. In general, two kinds of problems can
be distinguished. First, there are the problems that arise
when languages do not really match. Second, the problems
that occur when translations of two constructions depend
on one another.
The former type of problem is caused by lexical and struc-
tural holes. It means that source and target representation
do not really match. Lexical holes occur when a language
lacks words equivalent to the ones in the source language.
In the case of structural holes, the target language lacks
an equivalent construction rather than a word. A descrip-
tion of the concept will have to be used in these cases. For
an example of a lexical hole, compare sentence (1) and its
translation into English (2).

Unlike sentences with an adverb like &apos;vandaag&apos;, (1) cannot
be translated compositionally in the strictest sense. The
translation of (1) is not simply the translation of the parts
the constituent is composed of. This problem has been
solved in the CAT framework by liberalizing the definition
of compositionality in such a way that it will be possible to
render (1) directly into (2), by means of a rule like (3).

By (3) a construction composed of three daughters, sl, s2
and &apos;graag&apos; will be translated into a construction having
two daughters, viz, the translation of sl and a construc-
tion that again has two daughters, that is, the verb &apos;like&apos;
and the translation of 82. The main disadvantage of this
approach is the fact that combinations of exceptions have
to be described explicitly again, see (4) and (5).

translation rule separates a constituent into an orC
part and an exceptional part. Both parts are then I
lated separately and finally, in the target language, th
translated parts are joined again. In the case of a ser
consisting of both &apos;graag&apos; and &apos;gewoonlijk&apos;, the ser
is separated into an exceptional part, &apos;graag&apos; for exa
and an ordinary part, the rest of the sentence. Thi
again is separated into an exceptional, &apos;gewoonlijk&apos;, a
ordinary part. The latter is again that which is le
hind after extraction of the exceptional part. In th4
all these parts are joined and will make up a constri
in the target language. So, in MiMo not all daughte

In this paper we will examine the component of the:
formalism that has been developed to enable the for
tion of anaphoric relations on the one hand and con

and declarative way. This will be exemplified in section
4. In an MT context, it is however not enough to es-
tablish anaphoric relations monolingually. The question
is what the behaviour of these relations in translation is.
In MiMo, it is possible to translate the relations composi-
tionally. This will be discussed in section 5.

a source language is parsed into an interface structure (I).
This I-structure, in its turn, is translated into an interface
structure in the target language. From this structure the
target language text can then be generated. In this paper,
mainly the construction of I-structures, through analysis
and through transfer, will be focused on, hence the impor-
tance of understanding what these structures look like in
MiMo terms.
An I-structure is a tree. The mother node consists of the
lexical identifier (LI, the name of the lexical element), possi-
bly provided with a set of features, and a number of slots.
Slots can be filled with other I-structures that meet the
requirements specified by the slots. (9) is an example of
an I-structure. The I-structure (9) has an LI &apos;kiss&apos; and two

slots, an object slot and a subject slot. Fillers of these slots
will have to be nominal. The subject slot has been filled by
an I-structure that has &apos;john&apos; as LI, the object slot by the
I-structure with LI &apos;mary&apos;. We will abbreviate structures
like these as in (10) henceforth. So, an I-structure consists
of a certain LI, a feature bundle in parenthesis and a num-
ber of slots in square brackets preceded by a dot. A slot
is made up of the name followed by the equal sign and ti
I-structure that fills it.
Possible I-structures are defined in the lexicon. Distill(
(phrase structure) rules that define I-structures are nc
needed, all structures are specified in the lexicon. Gel
eralizations should be expressed in the lexicon as well. T11
advantage of this approach is the possibility of defining a
subcategorization phenomena directly. So, only coherer
structures in the sense of LFG (Bresnan 1982) are buil
In the lexicon, the slots have not yet been filled by oth&lt;
I-structures. The I-structure for &apos;kiss&apos; looks like (11) in ti

some other I-structure, the features of the slot and thol
of the I-structure are unified (see e.g. Shieber 1987). TI
I-structures represented so far were simplified for the sal
of readability. In reality, there is the possibility of indica
ing whether slots are optional or obligatory. Slots can al:
be marked with the Kleene star. The effect of this open
tor is that the slot is copied when an I-structure fills ti
slot. The I-structure will fill the copy and the original 014
remains as it was. The slot can be filled several times
I-structures in this way. The slot for modifiers is in fa4
marked with the Kleene star2 . An I-structure for (13(

much simpler this way. The representation of modifiers is a field

&apos;anaphor&apos;. I-structures having this feature will have to be
bound by an antecedent in the end. Examples of these are
pronouns and reflexives. This requirement also holds for
empty slots. They are considered anaphoric and will have
to be bound as well unless we deal with optional slots.
Binding of 1-structures happens through anaphoric rules.
In the next section we will show the way these rules are
formulated. The final structure of (13a) will be (14). In

complementizer is also regarded as a lexical word. Even
sentences that do not show a complementizer at surface
are assigned one. This is not in any way intrinsic to MiMo
but makes a uniform account of several phenomena possi-
ble. This type of complementizer has two slots: an optional
slot for topics or wh-words and a slot for a verb construc-
tion.

3 The definition of anaphoric rela-
tions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.916448773584906">
Anaphoric relations are defined by a type of rule that is
quite different from the ordinary rules. This distinguishes
the system from, for example DCG. With PATR and DCG
the possibility of percolation from, say topic to trace, influ-
ences all the other rules. MiMo&apos;s approach, a separate type
of rule for the anaphoric component, has the advantage of
leaving the other rules, i.e the lexical I-structures, as they
are. Modularity is one of MiMo&apos;s qualities. This quality is
also considered important in GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985)
where it is realized by the use of metarules that multiply
the number of rules. This would be undesirable in MiMo
4 Il and 12 are unique names which are automatically assigned to
every 1-structure. We will indicate them henceforth as capitalized
words. Names to which no further reference is made will be omitted
for clarity&apos;s sake. An 1-structure consists of a tree and a set of anno-
tations that denote the anaphoric relations within the tree. The tree
annotated with this set will be called Lobject henceforth.
5Note that we will usually leave out optional slots that are not
filled
since every lexical word is its own rule. So then eve
number of words would have to be multiplied.
The use of a different rule type is also motivated b
process of translating anaphoric relations. If we only
feature percolation to encode anaphoric relations, the
tions established would not be explicit anymore. An
tions in MiMo are clearly distinguishable from the r
the representation and as such make it possible to de
compositional translation of them in transfer.
Besides being modular, the system also proves to be d
ative. Both qualities, modularity and declarativit;
hance the workability for the user. Changes and e
sions are quite easily achieved and rules can be deft
a general way. An anaphoric component written fc
particular language can often be used for another lanl
with minor changes.
Anaphoric rules create anaphoric relations with
structures. This has two consequences in our system.
first place, some of the features of antecedent and an,
are unified. These features are called &apos;transparent&apos;.
for example, makes it possible to define agreement ph(
ena. The linguist defines which features are transr
with respect to a certain rule. The motivation for th
proach is discussed at length in Krauwer et al. (1987)
main point is that identity of some but not all featu
required in an antecedent-anaphor relation. In the s
place, the I-structure is augmented with an annotatioi

of the relation and the unique names of the nodes be
which the relation exists. The definition of anaphoi
lations makes use of these annotations (see also secti,

an open slot. The agreement features and the case fea-
ture are unified if possible, if not, the relation will not be
established. The structural relation itself, c_command in
this case, is defined by the user as well. Either a simple
structural relation is defined or a complex structural rela,
tion. The latter is composed of a regular expression over
structural relations9 . An example of a simple structural
relation is the sister-relation, defined in (16).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.953026333333333">
(16) sister(ANT,ANA) : (17) c_command:
?() .[ ? = ?(ANT), sister +
? = ?(ANA) 3 ancestor
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.990676825">
The structural relation sister holds between the I-structures
ANT and ANA if there exists an I-structure in which both
ANT and ANA fill slots. The exact nature of the LIs is
not important nor are the features or the names of the
slots, hence their representation as question marks in (16)9
. A complex structural relation is defined by means of a
regular expression over structural relations. The regular
expressions make use of the operators &apos;^&apos;, indicating op-
tionality, &apos;;&apos; for disjunction, &apos;*&apos; for iterativity (0, 1 or more
times ) and &apos;+&apos;. The latter has a special meaning which
can best be explained by means of the definition of the
c_command relation mentioned in (17). The &apos;+&apos; operator
indicates that the sister relation should hold between the
antecedent and some intermediate node and the ancestor-
relation between this intermediate node and the anaphor.
The Prolog-variant of (17) is (18). So, the c_command re-
lation holds between the I-structures ANT and ANA when
one of ANT&apos;s sisters is ANA&apos;s ancestor. The MiMo defini-

tion of &apos;ancestor&apos; is given in (19a). The relation is defined in
terms of the simple relation &apos;mother&apos;. The structural rela-
tion of the latter is in (19b)10. Features can be added to the
structural pattern to restrict the range of possible relations
further. This will be illustrated in the fourth section when
we discuss a possible way of treating wh-movement. To
This idea is partly based on LFG&apos;s notion of functional uncer-
tainty. See Kaplan et al. 1987.
9Note that the order of ANT w.r.t ANA is not relevant since the
order of the slots is not in any way related to word order in the
sentence.
°All I-structures are also their own ancestor according to the defi-
nition in (19a). This is the correct result when used in the c_command
definition since sisters do c_command one another. In case this is un-
desirable however, the relation could be defined as follows:
ancestor: mother + * mother
Generally, the correct definition of a relation like c_command depends
of course on the use it&apos;s being made of in anaphoric rules and on the
make up of the I-structures used. The definition above should merely
be regarded as an exemplification of the mechanism.

For English, S and NP are assumed to be bounding nodes.
Wh-movement takes place cyclically via the comp-positions
of the intermediate clauses, leaving behind traces (the so-
called comp-to-comp movement). As such, it does not cross
more than one bounding node at a time in a structure like
(23).
Our discussion of wh-movement in the next section is in
accordance with the comp-to-comp movement. Although
other approaches, such as direct movement, are feasible too,
we will adhere to the comp-to-comp approach. Data from
Spanish (Torrego 1984) also seem to support the preference
for actual movement from complementizer to complemen-
tizer.

According to Torrego, inversion is obligatory in all clauses
except the lowest. In the lowest clause, inversion is op-
tional. The GB theory accounts for this by claiming that
for Spanish S-bar, instead of S, is the bounding node. This
predicts that movement in the lowest cycle can take place
in two ways, as shown in (25). Neither of the two violates
subjacency. Assuming that a wh-constituent, or its trace,
in comp triggers inversion, the variation in Spanish word-
order in the lowest cycle is accounted for.
We will return to these data in the next section. We
will argue that these data can be handled by the MiMo-
mechanism as well, given the correct rules for the binding

can check whether the comp-position of a clause is either
filled or bound. If so, the clause is inverted. In this way,
the variation in word order in Spanish wh-questions will be
quite naturally accounted for.
This leaves us to show that our definition of wh-trace in-
deed establishes a relation in two different ways between
the antecedent and the open position. (27b) shows the
MiMo version of the structure in (27a). (27c) indicates
the way in which the relation is found without binding the
complementizer in the embedded clause. The relation &apos;sis-

Ths node in its turn binds the open position 13, through
mother-relations. The movement involves the crossing of
one bounding node. (27d) indicates the relation found.

In (28), the intermediate empty complementizer-position is
bound, hence inversion will take place. In (27) the comple-

case. The data are accounted for in quite a natural and

of the definitions of structural relations and they do not
have to be generated by some kind of arbitrary inversion

gual account of coindexation is quite an achievement. In
machine translation, the most important part of research
deals with the translation of the relations that were estab-
lished monolingually.
The I-object to be translated consists of an I-structure an-
notated with anaphoric relations. An I-object is the result
of the application of certain anaphoric relations (denoted
by the annotations) to a particular I-structure. The com-
positional translation of an I-object is the result of the ap-
plication of the translated annotations to the translated
I-structure. We hold the view that anaphoric relations are
universal in MiMo. The translation of a relation between
the I-structures I and J is that same relation between the
translations of I and J. This is summarized in (29).
(29) the translation of an I-object:
The translation of an I-object Il is the result of the appli-
cation of the translations of the annotations of D. to the
translation of Ws 1-structure. The translation of an anno-
tation R(I,J) is R(t(I),t(J)).
The final set of anaphoric relations of the target object
should be equivalent to the set that existed at the source
level. The following example illustrates principle (30) :
(30) Por que [ dice Juan [ que [ los dos creian [ que [ Pedro
habia pensado [ que [ el grupo habia aplazado la reunion
Why say John that the two thought that Peter believed
that the group postponed the meeting
Inversion being obligatory in all clauses except the lowest,
&apos;por que&apos; can only bind the modifier position in either the
first or the second clause. Each relation further down is ex-
- 305 -
cluded as more clauses would have to show inversion then.
When we ignore the bindings established at the Spanish
I-level, translation into English will produce a lot of pos-
sible translations since &apos;that&apos; may or may not be inserted
in every complementizer position in English. However, the
impact of this complementizer on possible anaphoric rela-
tions is not totally irrelevant. According to WAHL (1987),
the complementizer blocks binding of &apos;why&apos; to an empty
position deeper down, cf. (31) and (32).
(31) why(i)/(j) do you think _(i) the boat sank _(j)
(32) why(i) do you think _(i) that the boat sank _
When we preserve the bindings from Spanish and we claim
that in English &apos;that&apos; may never be inserted when its mod-
ifier position is bound to an antecedent, we can determin-
istically arrive at the right translation :
(33) Por que [ dice Juan [ que [ los dos creian [ que [ Pedro
habia pensado [ que [ el grupo habia aplazado la reunion
(34) Why [ did John say [ [ the two thought [ that [ Peter
believed [ (that) the group had postponed the meeting
Both are ambiguous since both can question the reason
for John&apos;s &apos;saying it&apos; and &apos;the two believing it&apos;. Other in-
terpretations are excluded in both Spanish and English.
Definition (29) also causes some problems. Take the fol-
lowing example from Italian (cf. Chomsky 1981) :
(35) l&apos;uomo [che mi domando [chi abbia visto]]
the man(i) of whom I wonder who(j) e(i) saw e(j)
One might wonder what the English translation would have
to be in the first place. In MiMo, the incorrect literal trans-
lation will not be found because the necessary anaphoric re-
lations cannot be established. In cases like these, separate
translation rules are needed to arrive at a translation of
(35). It is possible to refer explicitly to anaphoric relations
as long as they are restricted in depth. This is necessary in
case an expression without anaphoric relations translates
into one which requires a linking between an antecedent
and an anaphor. An example is (36).
(36) Jan zwemt graag John(i) likes _(i) to swim
Unboundedly deep embedded relations are however not ac-
cessible by translation rules in the transfer component.
Another problem we face deals with the interaction of
anaphora and other standard &apos;non-compositional&apos; phenom-
ena, such as the example of Dutch &apos;graag&apos; translating as
&apos;to like&apos; in English (see section 1). These examples, as well
as anaphora, can be handled compositionally, as we have
shown. The interaction however poses some problems, see
(37).
(37) Hoe graag sworn Jan = How much did John
swim
Since &apos;graag&apos; is displaced, translation of &apos;graag&apos; as t
ceptional part of the embedded sentence is not pc
given that the movement is not undonel2 . These
are even noncompositional from MiMo&apos;s tolerant vi
compositionality.

the Eurotra framework. MiMo however is not &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; official
Eurotra system. It differs in many critical respects from
e.g Bech &amp; Nygaard (1988). MiMo is the result of the joint

<abstract confidence="0.9961210625">Theoretical research in the area of machine translation usually involves the search for and creation of an appropriate formalism. An important issue in this respect is the way in which the compositionality of translation is to be defined. In this paper, we will introduce the anaphoric component of the Mimo formalism. It makes the definition and translation of anaphoric relations possible, relations which are usually problematic for systems that adhere to strict compositionality. In Mimo, the translation of anaphoric relations is compositional. The anaphoric component is used to define linguistic phenomena such as wh-movement, the passive and the binding of reflexives and pronouns monolingually. The actual working of the component will be shown in this paper by means of a detailed discussion of wh-movement.</abstract>

One of the main issues involved is whether the formalism does full justice to the idea that the translation of a whole is built from the translation of its parts on the one hand and whether it leaves enough room for the treatment of exceptions on the other hand. In other words, the question is in what way the idea of compositionality is to be defined within a particular formalism. An answer to this question from an interlingual perspective is given in the literature on the Rosetta system (e.g. Landsbergen 1985). The CAT frame work (e.g. Arnold et al. 1986) was meant to be an an swer to the same question, this time for a transfer system viz. the Eurotra system. The MiMo formalism is a re action to the CAT framework and tries to solve severs translation problems by formulating an alternative defini tion of compositionality. Phenomena involving anaphor 1 such as wh-movement and the coindexation of pronomi nals often cause problems for strictly compositional system since translation of one word depends on (the translatioi of) another word, one which can be quite far away in thl sentence.

MiMo&apos;s approach, a separate type of rule for the anaphoric component, has the advantage of leaving the other rules, i.e the lexical I-structures, as they are. Modularity is one of MiMo&apos;s qualities. This quality is also considered important in GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985) where it is realized by the use of metarules that multiply the number of rules. This would be undesirable in MiMo 4 Il and 12 are unique names which are automatically assigned to every 1-structure. We will indicate them henceforth as capitalized words. Names to which no further reference is made will be omitted for clarity&apos;s sake. An 1-structure consists of a tree and a set of annotations that denote the anaphoric relations within the tree. The tree annotated with this set will be called Lobject henceforth. 5Note that we will usually leave out optional slots that are not filled since every le</context>

The MiMo defini(18) c_command(Ant,Ana) :— sister(Ant,X), ancestor(X,Ana). tion of &apos;ancestor&apos; is given in (19a). The relation is defined in terms of the simple relation &apos;mother&apos;. The structural relation of the latter is in (19b)10. Features can be added to the structural pattern to restrict the range of possible relations further. This will be illustrated in the fourth section when we discuss a possible way of treating wh-movement. To This idea is partly based on LFG&apos;s notion of functional uncertainty. See Kaplan et al. 1987. 9Note that the order of ANT w.r.t ANA is not relevant since the order of the slots is not in any way related to word order in the sentence. °All I-structures are also their own ancestor according to the definition in (19a). This is the correct result when used in the c_command definition since sisters do c_command one another. In case this is undesirable however, the relation could be defined as follows: ancestor: mother + * mother Generally, the correct definition of a relation like c_command depends of course on the use it&apos;s being made of in anaphoric rules and on the make up of the I-stru</context>

<context position="1811" citStr="Landsbergen 1985" startWordPosition="286" endWordPosition="287"> Theoretical research as part of machine translation often aims at finding an appropriate formalism. One of the main issues involved is whether the formalism does full justice to the idea that the translation of a whole is built from the translation of its parts on the one hand and whether it leaves enough room for the treatment of exceptions on the other hand. In other words, the question is in what way the idea of compositionality is to be defined within a particular formalism. An answer to this question from an interlingual perspective is given in the literature on the Rosetta system (e.g. Landsbergen 1985). The CAT frame work (e.g. Arnold et al. 1986) was meant to be an an swer to the same question, this time for a transfer system viz. the Eurotra system. The MiMo formalism is a re action to the CAT framework and tries to solve severs translation problems by formulating an alternative defini tion of compositionality. Phenomena involving anaphor 1 such as wh-movement and the coindexation of pronomi nals often cause problems for strictly compositional system since translation of one word depends on (the translatioi of) another word, one which can be quite far away in thl sentence.

Wh-movement takes place cyclically via the comp-positions of the intermediate clauses, leaving behind traces (the socalled comp-to-comp movement). As such, it does not cross more than one bounding node at a time in a structure like (23). Our discussion of wh-movement in the next section is in accordance with the comp-to-comp movement. Although other approaches, such as direct movement, are feasible too, we will adhere to the comp-to-comp approach. Data from Spanish (Torrego 1984) also seem to support the preference for actual movement from complementizer to complementizer.
