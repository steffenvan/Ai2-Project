This is a very short book (150 pages, including index and
references), which introduces the basic concepts of ma-
chine translation and offers a concise and clear exposition
of the problems and issues faced by MT. It was meant for a
Japanese audience (this translation appears three years
after the original book did), and in some respects it can be
seen as self-advertising for the Japanese industry; at the
same time, it is also a good description of the specific
problems encountered in translating between Japanese and
English, and it gives a refreshing view of the history of the
field, which has usually been recounted from the Western
side. As each example contains the original Japanese text,
its transliteration, and a word-for-word gloss as well as the
English translation, a reader with no knowledge of Japan-
ese can follow quite easily the explanations that were meant
for a Japanese reader.
However, I have a few reservations. The translation is
sometimes awkward, especially in the second, more techni-
cal, part of the book, and it suffers from not having been
checked by a linguist: such expressions as referent and
referring are not used consistently, nor in a standard way
(e.g., when a subject NP is said to refer to its predicate),
and there is one case of actual mistranslation, where Chom-
sky&apos;s theory is referred to as transformational generation
grammar. Another unfortunate choice of terminology is
that of analytical, transformational, and generative gram-
mars instead of the more widely used and theory-neutral
grammars for analysis, transfer, and generation (p. 125).
More important is the lack of references, which raises
the question of who the intended audience is. The bibliogra-
phy is very short and not very representative of the field,
either in Japan or the rest of the world. Some works
mentioned in the main text (e.g., Nida&apos;s on the definition of
translation; p. 49) are not referenced. Others are casually
mentioned without even any name (e.g., tense and time
reference problems are supposed to be greatly clarified by
&amp;quot;recent linguistic work&amp;quot;; p. 104). Although it is clear that
Nagao&apos;s original book was not meant for academic re-
search and that the Japanese version was aimed at the
open-minded lay reader, the difficulties resulting from the
translation render the English version less easily accessible
to the corresponding English public. Nevertheless, in a field
where the few books available aim at a specialized audi-
ence, Nagao&apos;s is a valuable contribution that could prove a
good addition to a supplementary reading list in an introduc-
tory course in NLP, and could be useful for translators who
are not familiar with MT.
The two main issues Nagao addresses throughout the
book are those of pivot versus transfer and syntax versus
semantics. About the first, Nagao claims that the nuances
of Japanese linguistic expressions reflecting Japanese cul-
ture preclude the use of the same pivot language to trans-
late both within the European languages and between
European languages and Japanese. This is too cursorily
expressed, but the whole question of the choice between a
pivot language and a transfer technique approach is well
explained.
About the second, unsurprisingly and uncontroversially,
Naga() advocates a balanced use of syntax and semantics.
More open to controversy is his claim that the word order of
the source text should be preserved as a means to maintain
focus, and thus pragmatic information. To the question
&amp;quot;Which syntax?&amp;quot;, Nagao unequivocally advocates case
grammar, which is presented as a means of &amp;quot;resolving
questions of syntax on the basis of the meaning relations
between nouns and verbs.&amp;quot; To the question &amp;quot;Which
semantics?&amp;quot;, Nagao answers that the semantic methods,
i.e., &amp;quot;meaning tables&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;semantic networks,&amp;quot; which he
had proposed for sentence generation in 1963, are now
recognized as being unavoidable. His assessment that &amp;quot;at
that time, linguistics was not dealing with the problem of
meaning&amp;quot; would need some qualification, and so would his
categorical assertion that Montague semantics, as any
truth-value-based semantic theory, has proven inadequate
for translation (the ROSETTA project, for instance, can-
not be described as a research failure).
Nagao&apos;s conclusion that &amp;quot;language is a massive conglom-
eration of exceptions&amp;quot; is no surprise, nor is his requirement
that the design of any MT system should be flexible, robust,
and transparent. However, while it is clear that a good MT
system must be open (&amp;quot;allowing not only for the handling
of a wide variety of phenomena, but also allowing further
additions and modifications of the system&amp;quot;), it is less clear
what is meant by a system &amp;quot;capable of self-correcting
evolution&amp;quot; (p. 12).
Chapter 1, a short history of the field of MT in the world,
covers developments in Japan, as might be expected, but
also in the Soviet Union, and it ends with an optimistic
assessment of the effects of the ALPAC Report, one of

which was an increase in funding for basic research in
theoretical linguistics. In contrast to other overviews of the
history of MT (e.g., Slocum 1985; Buchmann 1987; War-
wick 1987), Nagao describes his personal experience and
his own involvement since the early days of MT in Japan.
Chapter 2, on &amp;quot;Revival in machine translation,&amp;quot; is of
course out of date since the book was originally written in
1986, but it contains an informative description of the
system for translating article titles, developed at the
Tsukuba Computer Center of the Industrial Technology
Institute. However, with only a vague and optimistic sketch
of the EUROTRA project, and a dismissive mention of
&amp;quot;little direct research on machine translation in America,&amp;quot;
this overview of the situation in Japan and other countries
does not do justice to the real revival that has occurred over
the past five years (e.g., with the creation of the Center for
Machine Translation in Pittsburgh in the U.S.; moreover,
is it fair to call the TAUM AVIATION project a failure?).
Chapter 3 is concerned with both perspective and evalua-
tion. It raises fundamental questions such as &amp;quot;What is
translation?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;How do we evaluate it?&amp;quot;, and presents a
realistic assessment of the possibilities of MT systems and
of the actual use their output can be put to, with a careful
discussion of post-editing. Translation tasks are divided
into three categories, according to the level at which the
text is meant to be interpreted: factual level, speaker level,
or social level. These levels are equated with the levels of
syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic adequacy of transla-
tion, respectively.
Starting with Chapter 4, Nagao describes his approach
to the process of translation. Compositionality is presented
as the basis for this process, but as the exposition is rather
sketchy, neither formal nor rigorous, &amp;quot;principles of
compositionality&amp;quot; appear to be no more than rules for
interpreting idiomatic expressions. The main theme is the
relation between syntax and semantics; more precisely, the
semantic resolution of syntactic ambiguities and the role of
semantics in the analysis of sentence structure. Morphol-
ogy is thus only mentioned as the problem of morphemic
analysis in a language written with no space between
words. Nagao argues that phrase structure grammar is not
adequate for free—word-order languages, and the relative
free word order of Japanese, i.e., the lack of significance
attached to the actual order of noun phrases, is given as an
argument for case grammar.
In a classical vein, parsing is seen as the main problem
(recursion in natural language is evoked only as a problem
for analysis); when that hurdle is cleared, sentence genera-
tion will proceed without too much trouble, provided the
internal structural representation is not too complicated.
The description of sentence analysis methods in Chapter 5
is a rather superficial discussion of syntax and the exam-
ples, of actually very simple structures, are hard to follow
(see the discussion of embedded sentences, by which is
meant relative clauses).
Chapter 6 is concerned with the selection of words for
translation and sentence generation, and presents the solu-
tions adopted in Nagao&apos;s system. Nagao points out that the
representations from case grammar, or any &amp;quot;deep structure&amp;quot;
equivalent, may be viewed as a sort of pivot language, but
argues that the idea of a universal pivot must be abandoned
in favor of a transfer approach, since &amp;quot;linguistic expres-
sions show differences . . . because of social and cultural
conditions&amp;quot; and the same internal representations cannot
always be used. Another argument given in favor of a
transfer approach is the fact that with a pivot approach, the
differences in sentence structure between Japanese and
English require making correct inferences about the nature
of missing arguments, which, given the current state of AT,
is often not possible. This is also an argument for not
relying on a full semantic interpretation of the text. Nagao
is careful to point out that the transfer approach requires a
very large number of specific rules, which is particularly
crucial with language pairs such as Japanese—English, for
which he claims the transfer procedure must be made as
detailed as possible (instead of being simplified as in &amp;quot;direct
transfer&amp;quot;). Transfer is composed of lexical transfer fol-
lowed by structural transfer. Lexical ambiguities are as-
sumed to be resolvable from the context and the domain,
but there is no hint of what may happen when resolution is
not possible.
As for structural transfer, despite the arguments for case
grammar found throughout the rest of the book, it turns out
to be &amp;quot;complicated and troublesome&amp;quot; (p. 117) to generate
directly from case grammar representations, so these are
first transformed (top-down and recursively) into phrase
structure representations, from which the target strings are
generated. The structures given as illustrations for a trans-
formational rule in structural transfer (p. 114) need some
explanations; as they stand, the rule looks arbitrary and
doesn&apos;t bear any discernible relation to its supposed applica-
tions.
I do not share Nagao&apos;s pessimistic views about whether
current linguistic theories could teach us about the &amp;quot;nature
of the transformations of the internal structure required
[by MT].&amp;quot; This might actually prove to be a fertile testing
ground for, e.g., GB&apos;s claims about the nature of universal
grammar with parameter settings and general principles.
What is unfortunate is that researchers in MT tend to
dismiss those claims as unrealistic and without any relation
to their concerns, while many researchers in theoretical
linguistics still perceive MT as a dirty &amp;quot;applied&amp;quot; domain.
The nice point Nagao makes about borrowing methodolo-
gies from comparative linguistics could apply here as well.
Chapter 7 discusses MT from the point of view of the
actual procedures involved. It contains good discussions of
pre-editing and post-editing procedures (including the re-
spective merits of redoing a translation from scratch or
post-editing a garbled translation), of the advantages gained
by merely automating the process of translation (the in-
crease in productivity is a side effect of using MT), as well
as of the problem of regressions introduced by changes
made during user update and dictionary revision. Nagao
addresses the question of the separation between a &amp;quot;core&amp;quot;
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 183
Book Reviews Looking Up: An Account of the COBUILD PaorEcr IN LEXICAL COMPUTING
fundamental vocabulary (untouchable by the user), and
&amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; vocabularies.
The traditional view of MT as a process of tree structure
transformation through pattern matching is complemented
by the more recent lexical approach in which the descrip-
tion of grammatical usage is stored in the dictionary as part
of the information attached to specific words, and in which
more specific rules block the more general ones (cf. Nagao
1987). Dictionary construction is therefore essential to the
enterprise, and one may hope that Nagao&apos;s plea for a
standardized dictionary format and international coopera-
tion in the elaboration of lexicons will be answered by the
recent dictionary and text database initiatives that have
been launched to meet those needs.
As a conclusion, Chapter 8 proposes Nagao&apos;s views on
the future of MT; these are summarized in the preface by
Nagao&apos;s Figure 0.1, which predicts a steady improvement
in the commercial systems and a sharp rise in the number of
MT users during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Nagao
also predicts that the improvements due to research in
syntax and semantics have basically leveled off, and that
further progress will come from research on intersentential
components from an Al rather than purely linguistic point
of view. For instance, one of the phenomena that MT
cannot yet handle is discourse analysis, and both the resolu-
tion of intersentential relations and the resolution of refer-
entials without a referent in the text require making infer-
ences about the world. However, Nagao makes the nice
point that it is very difficult for an NLP system driven by
inferences to deal with new relationships set up in a text,
while this is what natural language does all the time (i.e.,
creates novel sentences that are interpretable). High-level
translation capabilities will require long-term basic re-
search both in theoretical linguistics and in cognitive sci-
ence, going beyond the limits of traditional linguistics on
particular languages and toward a theory of translation.
As MT is still in its infancy, Nagao advocates a realistic
assessment of its possibilities by following the &amp;quot;engineering
practice of limitations based on assumptions about
functionality.&amp;quot; For example, the problem of voice recogni-
tion must be solved for interpreting systems, and because of
efficiency considerations, the future of interactive systems
probably lies in small-quantity private systems. As a final
thought-provoking remark: MT is probably more useful
between pairs of languages that do not have many mutual
speakers, rather than the classic pairs of well-known lan-
guages.

nature of the work on lexical computing shared between the
University of Birmingham and Collins Publishers. The
COBUILD dictionary project, going back to early 1980,
resulted in the publication in 1987 of the Collins CO-
BUILD English Language Dictionary. There are at least
three major factors that set it apart from other learners&apos;
dictionaries of English language: it is a wholly new diction-

presentation of entries, it represents a radical departure
from existing lexicographic conventions. By its own ac-

new and use advanced computer technology. For the user

different&amp;quot; (from the introduction to the COBUILD Diction-

This difference stems from the interleaving of several
basic principles in applied linguistics and dictionary compi-

enced lexicographic practice in the course of preparing the
dictionary. Language is a constantly changing dynamic
system; consequently, no existing—and by that token al-

As MT is still in its infancy, Nagao advocates a realistic assessment of its possibilities by following the &amp;quot;engineering practice of limitations based on assumptions about functionality.&amp;quot; For example, the problem of voice recognition must be solved for interpreting systems, and because of efficiency considerations, the future of interactive systems probably lies in small-quantity private systems. As a final thought-provoking remark: MT is probably more useful between pairs of languages that do not have many mutual speakers, rather than the classic pairs of well-known languages.</abstract>

The traditional view of MT as a process of tree structure transformation through pattern matching is complemented by the more recent lexical approach in which the description of grammatical usage is stored in the dictionary as part of the information attached to specific words, and in which more specific rules block the more general ones (cf. Nagao 1987). Dictionary construction is therefore essential to the enterprise, and one may hope that Nagao&apos;s plea for a standardized dictionary format and international cooperation in the elaboration of lexicons will be answered by the recent dictionary and text database initiatives that have been launched to meet those needs. As a conclusion, Chapter 8 proposes Nagao&apos;s views on the future of MT; these are summarized in the preface by Nagao&apos;s Figure 0.1, which predicts a steady improvement in the commercial systems and a sharp rise in the number of MT users during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
