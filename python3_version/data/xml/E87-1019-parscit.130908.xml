A system of fail-soft (emergency) meas-
ures for a production-oriented MT system
is discussed, stating first the specific
purposes of such a system, and showing then,
how these measures are being used in the
system of English-to-Czech machine trans-
lation as prepared by the group of mathe-
matical linguistics at Charles University
in Prague.
1. In view of a production-oriented system
of machine translation, under the present-
-day conditions, one should keep in mind
that the end-user expects to have at his
disposal a complete text rather than an al-
ternating sequence of (sentence) segments
and blanks. On the other hand, everyone
who has ever made even a perfunctory look
at the problems involved in MT would agree
that there is no such thing as a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot;
MT system, neither in the dictionary nor
in the grammar part of it. Also, as is com-
monly accepted nowadays, any system with
texts written in natural language at the
input should provide measures for some kind
of treatment of ill-formed input. Thus it
is inevitable to consider, first, what type
and quality of translation can meet the
demands of a prospective user and what kind
of translation is realizable under the
given conditions, and, second, to decide
what is to be sacrificed from, and what
added to the system to make it work in a
production enviroment.
In the present paper we would like to
outline one aspect of the approach taken
up at the start of our experiment APAC3-2 -
the English--.-Czech machine translation
system for translating INSPEC abstracts
from the field of microelectronics (for a
description of the history of the MT ef-
forts of our team, see Haji6ovd, 1986;
the APAC series is described in full detail
in Kirschner, 1982; 1984; in press). We
should emphasize that in the conditions
within our reach, we aim at a satisfacto-
rily accurate rendering in target language
of the contents of a relatively simple
text in source language, which would suf-
fice for such a system to be applicable in
information acquisition and would be ca-
pable to meet the main requirements set up
by average users.
2.1 The specific purposes of the system
of fail-soft (&amp;quot;emergency&amp;quot;) measures to
overcome anomalous input phenomena and
partial failures of the MT system can be
stated as follows:
- The whole processing is divided into
several stages to identify and treat more
probable interpretations of some structures
preferentially - to make the &amp;quot;preferential&amp;quot;
approach (see below, Sect.2.2) a reality.

The drawback is that in these circumstances
the danger of a dilemmatic situation result-
ing in a cul-de-sac impasse increases. A
special device has been introduced to over-
come such an abnormal end: instead of elimi-
nating such a defective string, the applica-
tion of the phase in question is suspended -
the program processing this string skips the
phase and continues in the next one. The
rules that compensate for the lacuna can be
either the rules that in the framework of
&amp;quot;preferential&amp;quot; approach take up the role
of their more strict predecessors, or rules
added particularly for this purpose - to
deal with the most undesirable consequences
of such an omission.
- In the analysis, the emergency rules
interpret unrecognized elements and inte-
grate them into more complex structures.
- In the synthesis, they help to produce
an output that makes sense, corresponds to
the source language, and is easier to post-
-edit.
- Whenever it is possible, they attempt
at forming target language equivalents for
the unidentified elements, either by adapt-
ing international words or by &amp;quot;czechizing&amp;quot;
English dictionary forms by enduing them
with qualities and forms proper to their
presumptive Czech counterparts - e.g.,
gender, suffixes, etc.
- With some classes of words, they serve
as general dictionary rules provided the
sets of semantic features, frame informa-
tion and other necessary outfit of individ-
ual members of these classes correspond to
the standard apparatus assigned to their
representation in the framework of a gen-
eral device, and their orthography ensures
forming correct equivalents in Czech.
2.2 The fail-soft measures can be charac-
terized as consisting of three main parts:
the first two concern elements not found
in the basic dictionaries and the third
concerns failures to arrive at an accom-
plished parse. (We leave aside a discussion
of the unification of orthography - such
as American and British usage, different
ways of spelling, use of hyphens etc. -
which comes before the first device de-
scribed here.) In a sense, there is a set
of other rules of &amp;quot;emergency&amp;quot; character:
general rules (which can be called &amp;quot;sweep-
ing rules&amp;quot;) designed to operate after all
more specific rules failed to apply - e.g.,
in the formation of compounds or in nominal
syntax in general, etc.; however, this
being a constitutional component of what
we call &amp;quot;preferential&amp;quot; approach, we shall
confine ourselves to describing only the
former three sets. To avoid a possible
misunderstanding, we should make clear
that when we call our approach &amp;quot;preferen-
tial&amp;quot;, it is only the name that it has in
common with Wilks&amp;quot; &amp;quot;preferential semantics&amp;quot;.
In our system, we apply a rather trivial
and simple principle with the aid of which
the different probability of interpreta-
tion(s) of some parts of a string is taken
into account and exploited. The most prob-
able solutions are covered by the rules
first and with as detailed an accuracy as
possible; the next probable solution is
offered in some of the subsequent phases,
etc., under more liberal conditions. The
&amp;quot;sweeping rules&amp;quot; come last. That is also
the reason why we write &amp;quot;preferential&amp;quot;
with quotation marks.
2.21 The first device aimed at intercept-
ing and interpreting words that failed to
be found in the basic dictionaries is the
co-called transducing dictionary (TD).
Its task is to interpret the still unre-
cognized words according to their typical
and (mostly) productive suffixes (the in-
flectional endings being detached and dic-
tionary forms reconstructed by morphemic
analysis in the preceding steps), and to
</bodyText>

105
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99929697752809">
assign to them part-of-speech and semantic
information. Thus, e.g., words ending in
-ER, -OR, -GRAPH, -ODE and some others are
interpreted as nouns, concrete, instruments,
capable of being substituted for human ac&apos;-
tor; words ending in -CS, -CY, -ESS, -TUDE
are supposed to be nouns, abstract, prop-
erties and, as distict from those ending
in -ITY, -ICS, -SM, -SHIP, -HOOD, -THM,
which otherwise have the same semantic
characteristics, they form adjectives in
a regular manner in Czech; the endings
-FY, -ATE, -ISE (-IZE), -DUCE indicate
verbs that can be both transitive and in-
transitive, of causative and (semi) termi-
nological character,yet not allowed to form
adjectices of the purposive type. A number
of adjectival suffixes is contained, too,
viz. -ARY, -AL, -RSE, -IVE, -OUS, -IC, -BLE,
-LESS, -ANAR: -LEAR, -NEAR, -OLAR, -ULAR.
In all, about 50 classes of nouns, 13 of
adjectives and 4 of verbs are covered by
the TD device.
Two further pieces of information should
be added, the first being probably super-
fluous: 1) All words having such suffixes
but different properties as regards their
part-of-speech category, semantic features,
etc., are supposed to be contained in the
basic dictionaries. 2) Most of the classes
of words treated by the TO are internation-
al words of Latin or Greek origin; they
can easily be &amp;quot;transduced&amp;quot; to Czech by re-
latively simple procedures; some of these
procedures precede the TO operation as a
part of a special morphemic analysis, but
most of them operate in the synthesis, as
anaccessory to the English - Czech diction-
ary. A set of recursively applied rules
(in several cycles) takes over the words
identified by TO, desintegrates them, re-
places the English suffixes by the corre-
sponding Czech ones, and scans the bases
for spelling configurations to be trans-
formed or adapted to Czech orthography
(replacing, e.g. PH by F, TH by T, C pre-
ceding A,L,O,R,T,U by K; S preceded by A,
E,I,N,O,R,Y and followed by A,E,I,0 is re-
placed by Z, etc.). Thus, e.g. PHOTOLITO-
GRAPHIC changes into FOTOLITOGRAFICKE2,
CYCLOTRON gives CYKLOTRON, ISOSMOTIC is
transcribed as IZOSMOTICKE2. To give an
example of solving similar problems, let
us consider the word ISOSEISMIC: to pre-
clude the second S situatedat a morphemic
juncture from becoming a Z, would require
either a special entry in the main diction-
ary - as one word or as combination of the
prefixal ISO + SEISMIC, in which case the
adjective must be contained in the diction-
ary - or some similar preliminary treatment
in the special morphemic analysis preceding
the TD; the latter way of treatment would
probably represent the best solution, which
may be generalized for all or most of the
typical terminological prefixes involving
analogous problems as IZOSEISMICKE2 - e.g.,
A-, INFRA-, PRE-, PERI-, SEMI-, SYN-, MESO-,
MONO-, HYPER-, POLY- etc. (needless to add
that this time it would be such words as
ISOSMOTIC that would require a specific
treatment, e.g. to processonly SMOTIC -
- from ISO + SMOTIC - in the dictionary).
It should be remarked that, in principle,
this part of the transducing device - or-
thographical changes - need not be sepa-
rated from the front part operating in the
analysis.
2.22 Words that remain unaccounted for
after passing the TD phases - i.e., not
found in the dictionaries and not belonging
to any of the classes dealt with in the
transducing device - are subjected to fur-
ther analysis; those having typical verbal
inflectional endings (-ING, -ED) are re-
garded as verbs, those ending in -LY are
taken for adverbs provided that more than
2 character&apos;s precede and their tentative
status is syntactically corroborated. The

rest are first treated as proper names
and if the subsequent analysis fails to
confirm this conjecture - i.e., they are
not integrated into wider nominal complexes,
e.g., as an apposition - they become nouns
(which, by the way, happens to the tenta-
tive adverbs, too). The words identified
in this tentative manner are &amp;quot;czechized&amp;quot;,
which in some cases might result in quite
acceptable formations - e.g., if the orig-
inal words can be taken an &amp;quot;international&amp;quot;
or technically and terminologically univ-
ocal terms: GETTERING -4 GETEROVA2NI2,
ABEND -4 ABENDOVAT - in other cases in
more or less comical &amp;quot;macaronic&amp;quot; creations.
In conclusion, it should be added that the
original more ambitious idea of assigning
to each unrecognized word (that does not
carry any characteristic clue making the
guess easier) three parallel tentative in-
terpretations to let the syntactic analy-
sis decide -noun, verb, adverb - had to be
abandoned for reasons similar to those that
led to the resignation in the case of hy-
persentential context. Too many possibil-
ities, often combined with other parallel
solutions, led to combinatorial explosion
that (though often not assuming the char-
acter of an infinite loop) expanded the
structures to such an extent that sooner
or later an overflow became inevitable. So
far, there is no remedy for overflow in
our system.
2.23 The last, relatively simple, measure
concerns cases where a single parse Cor
more parallel single parses) - i.e., trees
covering individual input strings - failed
to be formed in the last phase of the anal-
ysis; usually two or more partial trees
are formed instead, which fact may be caus-
ed by anomalous structure of the input
string, or owing to some partial failure
in analyzing one or more substrings (e.g.,
when some element(s) or structure(s) were
misinterpreted), or as a result of some
subjective shortcomings
- omission, error, etc.
gram is able to process
and fragmentary results
compiling an acceptable
special character (6.3
front of such output strings to signalize
that they had been formed on the basis of
defective results of the analysis. If nec-
essary, a set of rules of a more or less
ad-hoc character deprives &amp;quot;underdone&amp;quot;
(sub)trees of all auxiliary structures
(category labels, parentheses, separators,
features, etc.) leaving only lexical val.?&apos;
ues, and performs thus the finishing
touches to bring the substitute output as
close to readable and acceptable results
as possible.
3. The outputs of individual phases can
be obtained in the listing. Some of these
phases, esp. the last-but-one phase fixing
the state of things before the syntactic
measures have been applied, usually pre-
serve information enough to recognize and
examine the unretouched results and to
divulge the diagnosis of errors or short-
comings necessary for further progress.
This is to say that most of the &amp;quot;emergen-
cy&amp;quot; devices operate at moments and in a
manner which permit to examine the previ-
ous state of things, so that their action
does not obscure the regular course of
the processing and allows normal control
of it. It should be added that a part of
emergency devices has a temporary charac-
ter dealing with omissions and bugs proper
to the system under development. We are
sure that at least some of them will be-
come superfluons.

In the present paper we would like to outline one aspect of the approach taken up at the start of our experiment APAC3-2 - the English--.-Czech machine translation system for translating INSPEC abstracts from the field of microelectronics (for a description of the history of the MT efforts of our team, see Haji6ovd, 1986; the APAC series is described in full detail in Kirschner, 1982; 1984; in press). We should emphasize that in the conditions within our reach, we aim at a satisfactorily accurate rendering in target language of the contents of a relatively simple text in source language, which would suffice for such a system to be applicable in information acquisition and would be capable to meet the main requirements set up by average users. 2.1 The specific purposes of the system of fail-soft (&amp;quot;emergency&amp;quot;) measures to overcome anomalous input phenomena and partial failures of the MT system can be stated as follows: - The whole processing is divided into several stages t</context>
