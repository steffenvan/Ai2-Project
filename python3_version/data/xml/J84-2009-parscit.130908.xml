The Committee on Basic Research in the Behavioral and
Social Sciences is a National Research Council unit
established in 1980 to assess and improve the vitality of
research in behavioral and social sciences. The first
Committee report, Behavioral and Social Science
Research: A National Resource (1982), was a general
statement of the scientific value, significance, and social
utility of behavioral and social science research. A
second Committee report, currently in preparation,
derives from a 1983 symposium on &amp;quot;Knowledge in Social
and Behavioral Science: Discoveries and Trends over
Fifty Years&amp;quot;.
These two Committee projects concentrated on the
past record and present dimensions of behavioral and
social science. There is now a national commitment to
expand the future scientific and technological base.
Promising new research directions must be canvassed,
resources needed to foster prospective advances must be
defined and evaluated, and priorities for additional scien-
tific research spending must be developed and rigorously
scrutinized. These processes are now occurring in nearly
every major branch of science.
The Committee has therefore agreed to undertake a
Decade Outlook on Research Opportunities in the
Behavioral and Social Sciences, with the formal partic-
ipation of the National Research Council&apos;s Commission
on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, the
Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences,
and the Social Science Research Council. This project,
supported by the National Science Foundation, the
Russell Sage Foundation, and other sponsors, will be
completed in 1986.
The Decade Outlook will study scientific frontiers,
leading research questions, and new resources needed
over the next decade, roughly 1986-1995, for rapid
progress on fundamental problems in the behavioral and
social sciences. The final report is to contain recommen-
dations for research resources, facilities, and programs
that may provide a high level of returns to fundamental
knowledge. Research areas and new resource needs will
be identified by the Committee with substantial advice
from many distinguished senior level, mid-career, and
promising younger scientists.
The Committee invites your ideas on leading research
questions for the next ten years and on new resources

their stay. Since space is limited, arrangements should be
made early. Some Graduate Student Fellowships to

The program committee consists of Jon Barwise, Solo-
mon Feferman, David Israel, and William Marsh.
The first week (July 8-13) conflicts with the 1985
meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics
(July 8-12, in Chicago). The program committee tried
very hard to avoid such conflicts. Unfortunately we
faced constraints that made it impossible to do so.
(Indeed, as things now stand, the Summer Meetings also
overlap with another ASL meeting, on Logic and Alge-
bra, in Paris.)
The growth of truly inter-disciplinary work brings with
it a high likelihood that there will be scheduling clashes
involving the various professional organizations of which
researchers are members. We deeply regret this clash
between the ASL-CSLI Summer Meetings and the ACL
Conference; and we will work hard in the future to elimi-
nate such conflicts.

This new kind of concept-pinpointer groups all words by
their effect on the environment — by procedure (= transi-
tive verb). It divides each binarily into its sub-processes,
such as TO JOCKEY = TO RIDE AND TO MANEUVER.
The Hierarchy half of the book arranges the 24,600 tran-
sitives from simple to complex. The Index half alphabet-
izes them. Thus the user can trace any process back,
phase by phase, toward its components (its causes), or
forward toward its potential effects. There are a quarter
million words including all parts of speech. Thereby the
reader can pinpoint any idea, then skip-branch (instead
of plodding) to its causes or effects. Includes 90,000
words of instruction and theory. For authors, linguists,
attorneys, engineers.
