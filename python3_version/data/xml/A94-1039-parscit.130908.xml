<bodyText confidence="0.976157615384615">
The &amp;quot;Selective Error Correction Method&amp;quot;
to judge these three types of errors, and
correct them, using m-th order Markov
chain model for Japanese `Icanji-kana&apos; char-
acters, has been proposed and shown to be
useful to detect and correct errors gener-
ated randomly (Araki et al., 1994).
In this paper, this method is applied to
detect and correct erroneous characters in
Japanese text input through an OCR.. The
method is confirmed to be also effective to
detect and correct the errors introduced by
the OCR.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99978848">
In order to improve the computers&apos; man-machine
interfaces, input devices suc.h as Optical Character
Readers(OCR) or speech recognition devices have
been developed. However, text input through an
OCR or a speech recognition device usually contains
erroneous character strings.
The erroneous characters can be classified into
three types. The first is characters that have been
recognized incorrectly, that is taken to be characters
other than the correct characters. The second and
the third are extra characters wrongly inserted and
deleted (skipped) characters. Markov chain models
have been used to find and correct the first type of
errors.
Recently, the Selective Error Correction Method
to judge the three types of the errors and correct
correct these errors, using m-th order Markov chain
model for Japanese `kanji-kana&apos; characters, has been
proposed (Araki et al., 1994).
In this paper, the Selective Error Correction
Method is applied to detect and correct erroneous
characters in Japanese text input through an OCR.
An experimental procedure using the Selective Error
Correction Method for erroneous Japanese phrases
input through OCR is described in Fig.l.

3 Basic Definitions and the Selective
Error Correction Method using
2nd-Order Markov Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997923486486487">
A Japanese sentence can be separated into syntactic
units called phrases ( usually called &amp;quot;bunsetsu&amp;quot; ).
Japanese phrases in a text can be divided into two
types: correct phrases, erroneous phrases. The set of
correct Japanese phrases is represented by Fc. The
set of erroneous phrases is denoted by FE, and it
is further divided into three types: The first is er-
roneous phrases which contain erroneous characters
substituted wrongly in the phrase, and is denoted by
Fs. The second and the third are erroneous phrases
which have characters ommitted from them (denoted
by I&apos;D) or inserted wrongly in them (denoted by r,).
The accuracy ratios to detect and to correct the
errors by a method are evaluated by the &amp;quot;Relevance
Factor&amp;quot; P and the &amp;quot;Recall Factor&amp;quot; R. Here, P de-
notes the ratio of errors detected or corrected by a
method to the whole of FE. R denotes the ratio that
the elements of FE can be detected or corrected by
a method.
Next, we introduce the following assumption
based on previous experiments: &amp;quot;Each Markov prob-
ability for erroneous chains of syllables and `kanji-
kana&apos; characters is small compared to that of correct
chains&amp;quot;.
According to this assumption, the procedure of
detecting the location i and the length k of error
chains is defined as followed: Namely, the procedure
detects that k characters are wrongly substituted or
inserted at the location i, if the m-th order Markov
probability for a chain remains smaller than the crit-
ical value T just (k + m) times from the location i
to i k + m â€” 1.
Similary, the method of detecting the location
of a chain wrongly deleted in r(1,;) and the meth-
ods of correcting the chains with wrongly substi-
tuted, inserted or deleted characters are described
in Ref.(Araki et al., 1994).

4 Experimental Results Using

4.1 Experimental Results

The critical value of the 2nd-order Markov probabil-
ity T was determined so as to make the value of P

mental results are described as follows:

[2] The Relation of P and R for erroneous phrases
The maximum values of P and R for the location
of erroneous &apos;kanji-kana&apos; character strings using er-
ror detection procedures and those of the errors cor-
rected using error correction procedures, are as fol-
lows: (1) p(D) = 79.0% /3.(.5D) = 74.5% (2) Pr =

The values of RT) and P(D) mean that this
method can find 74.5% of the erroneous phrases Fs
(substitution type), and 21.0% of the errors detected
by this method are errors detected wrongly.
From these results, it is shown that the Selective
Error Correction Method using 2nd-order Markov
models is useful to detect and correct erroneous char-
acters substituted wrongly in text input through an
OCR.

4.2 Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.9990335">
[1] The characteristics of Erroneous Strings input
through OCR.
Compared to the errors randomly generated
(Araki et al., 1994), the errors caused by OCR
showed high occurrence in the following four types of
errors: (1) mixed type (combination of three error
types ), (2) errors located at the head and at end
of phrases, (3) errors that length of an erroneous
string in a phrase is greater than 3, and (4) errors
distributed within a phrase.
[2] The comparison of the value of P and R for error
detection and error correction.
The maximum values of P and R to detect and
correct errors caused by an OCR are inferior to that
of errors generated randomly by 20-40%.
The main reasons why the maximum values of P
and R are reduced can mainly be explained by the
characteristics of (2) and (4) above mentioned.
However, regarding to (1) substitution errors, (2)
errors located inside phrases, (3) errors of length 1
and (4) errors connected in phrases, it is seen that
the maximum values of P and R to detect and cor-
rect errors by OCR, are nearly equal to those for
errors generated randomly.

racy ratios to detect and correct the OCR errors is
inferior to those of random errors.
