Using Speech Recognition is written for people
from various professional backgrounds who
have recently come into contact with speech
recognition and possibly need to make a de-
cision as to how it can most profitably be
applied in their field. Accordingly, the book
makes an effort to be easily readable and tries
to avoid technical detail while still informing
the reader about the crucial issues in speech
recognition systems.
The largest part of the book is taken up
by the chapters: &amp;quot;What is a Speech Recog-
nition System?,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Representing the Vocab-
ulary,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Adding Structure,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Speaker Mod-
eling,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Flow of Speech,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The
Speaking Environment.&amp;quot; Each of these is di-
vided into two parts, called &amp;quot;Technology
Focus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Application Focus.&amp;quot; The tech-
nology part introduces the options that re-
searchers have pursued, while the applica-
tion focus discusses what choices should be
made for a given application and what ap-
proaches have resulted in commercial prod-
ucts. For example, the technology focus of
Chapter 4, &amp;quot;Adding Structure,&amp;quot; states that
there are essentially three ways to restrict
the number of legal word sequences that
a recognition system will accept: finite-state
grammars, statistical n-gram models, and lin-
guistic grammars. The application focus then
proceeds to clarify that finite-state grammars
are the correct choice for small-vocabulary
command-and-control tasks, while n-grams
are used in most large-vocabulary systems. It
is also stated that linguistic grammars have
not found a way into the marketplace as a
part of speech recognition systems, and that
true language understanding systems that al-
low natural discourse between humans and
computers will not be commercially available
in the foreseeable future.
While all this sounds fairly technical, the
author is prepared to avoid mathematics at
any price. As far as I have noticed, there is
not a single formula even of the simplest
kind in the text. At the same time, there
is indeed a section called &amp;quot;Transfer Func-
tions in Neural Networks.&amp;quot; I think it is a
waste of time to talk about nodes in a net-
work and how information is propagated be-
tween them if you are not in a situation to
give some mathematical facts. In my opin-
ion, large parts of the technology focus suf-
fer from this defect. Readers will not really be
able to understand what, for example, &amp;quot;trans-
fer functions&amp;quot; are. They will just accumulate
a useful set of catchwords and phrases that
will come in handy in the next meeting.
The strong point of the book, and the rea-
son why I would recommend it to applica-
tion developers and decision makers, is its
up-to-date survey of commercial applications
of speech recognition. You will find a clear
taxonomy of applications (data entry, com-
mand and control, dictation, etc.) in the chap-
ter entitled &amp;quot;Application Types&amp;quot; and numer-
ous examples of successful commercial sys-
tems in the chapter &amp;quot;Applications at Work.&amp;quot;
Somewhere in the book, you will find the
name of every important company in the
market and what their products are. Also, if
the technical sections are too vague for your
tastes, there is always a reference to a fun-
damental scientific paper. The bibliography
is excellent and contains most of the classic
papers in the field.
Most importantly, the book is easy reading.
If you always wanted to know something
about speech recognition and you don&apos;t have
the time or nerve to fight your way through
a lot of scientific papers, read this book on
the plane while on a business trip.â€”Andreas
