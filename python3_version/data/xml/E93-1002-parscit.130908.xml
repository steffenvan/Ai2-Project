1 Computational Modelling of
Incremental Language Production
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859346153846">
This paper sketches some basic features of the
SYNPHONICS account of the computational modelling
of incremental language production with the example of
the generation of passive sentences. The SYNPHONICS
(&amp;quot;Syntactic and Phonological Realization of Incremen-
tally Generated conceptual structures&amp;quot;) approach, which
subscribes to a cognitive science perspective on lan-
guage processing, aims at linking psycholinguistic
insights into the nature of the human natural language
production process with well-established assumptions in
theoretical and computational linguistics concerning the
representation and processing of grammatical knowl-
edge.
Research in psycholinguistics (e.g., Garrett 1988,
Levelt 1989) has revealed that the process of converting
a preverbal, conceptual content into overt speech is per-
formed by a number of autonomous sub-processes spe-
cialized for different tasks within the overall process: the
pre-linguistic conceptualization component (the Con-
ceptualizer, in Levelt&apos;s terms) plans a content to be
expressed and delivers a corresponding conceptual repre-
sentation to the linguistic formulation component (the
Formulator), which in turn selects the appropriate items
(lemmas and lexemes) from the system&apos;s lexical data
base and, guided by the syntactic and phonological spec-
ifications of the lexical items, produces abstract syntac-

tic and phonological representations. The output of the
Formulator is taken up by the articulation component
(the Articulator), whose task it is to produce a physical
speech signal. These components are considered to be
autonomous modules, whose modes of operation are
each governed by their own sets of principles and restric-
tions. Furthermore, the system as a whole is constrained
by there being a unidirectional flow of information, i.e.,
there is no feedback between sub-processes.1 Finally, it
is widely accepted that human language production pro-
ceeds in an incremental, piecemeal fashion (Kempen &amp;
Hoenkamp 1987): Rather than having to wait for com-
plete input structures, components are able to process
fragmentary input (&amp;quot;increments&amp;quot;). As soon as a particu-
lar component has passed the results on to its successor
component, it is ready for processing the next input
increment. Thus, a given increment is processed sequen-
tially by different components, whereas components
may operate in parallel on different increments.
Theoretical linguists of various persuasions converge on
the idea that a large amount of grammatical information
that former theories of grammar handled by extensive
rule systems ought to be captured by detailed grammati-
cal specifications of lexical items instead. From this
angle, the grammar of a language merely consists of a
small set of general licensing principles for structures
projected from the lexicon. The present paper subscribes
to this view. More specifically, the SYNPHONICS
Formulator uses a grammar for German in the mold of
Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard
&amp; Sag 1987, 1992). The HPSG-style lexical approach
to basic aspects of grammar tallies with the central role
that recent psycholinguistic theories of language produc-
tion assign to the lexicon in the formation of linguistic
structures (lexicon-driven generation; e.g., Levelt 1989).
In contrast to other approaches to the computational
modelling of empirically substantiated features of
human language production, such as Kempen &amp;
Hoenlcamp&apos;s (1987) Incremental Procedural Grammar
and de Smedt&apos;s (1990) Incremental Parallel Formulator,
however, the SYNPHONICS process model distinguishes
strictly between declarative grammatical knowledge and
its procedural application, thus taking the stance of
theoretical linguistics and related computational
approaches. As in HPSG, the declarative grammatical
knowledge of the SYNPHONICS Formulator is repre-
seined in a unification-based formalism with sorted fea-

incremental processing (e.g., Reithinger 1992) often make

tare structures. Unlike deduction-based approaches to
natural language generation in computational linguistics
(e.g., Shieber et al. 1990), however, the SYNPHONICS
approach involves a detailed and transparent process
model, with sub-processes being explicitly specified at
any point in the overall process. This property serves to
make the model adjustable to empirical results about the
course of human language production and open to a veri-
fication of its claims, namely to aim at the computa-
tional modelling of cognitive processes.
In order to make the above considerations more concrete,
we will discuss the roles of the Conceptualizer and the
Formulator in the production of a particular linguistic
construction in some more detail in the remainder of
this paper. The discussion of the principles guiding the
production of passive sentences serves to illustrate to
what extent the determinants of this construction can be
traced to the feedback-free interplay between the
Conceptualizer and the Formulator and the constraints
specific to the involved modules. We cannot go into the
details of the passive here; rather, we will confine the
presentation to some quite simple cases. In order to cap-
ture the full range of the passive construction across
languages, the account presented here needs to be
enlarged in parts.

2 The SYNPHONICS Conceptualizer
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990076">
The conceptual input into the Formulator - in short: CS
for &amp;quot;conceptual structure&amp;quot; - is represented in the
RefO/RefN format (Habel 1982, 1986a/b; Eschenbach et
al. 1989). The basic representational units are Referen-
tial Objects (RefOs), which are stored and processed in a
net-like structure, a Referential Net (RefN). RefOs are
labeled, inter alia, with sortal attributes and property and
relation designations. The notion of RefOs comprises
the entire range of discourse entities, such as objects,
times, and situations (events, processes, states).
The input representation reflects certain aspects of the
organization of the information which the
Conceptualizer delivers to the Formulator. One impor-
tant dimension of organization is the relative promi-
nence of conceptual units such as particular RefOs. In
the incremental process of forming .a conceptual repre-
sentation of the content to be expressed in an utterance,
relative prominence can manifest itself in the time
course of conceptualization, with more prominent units
tending towards earlier conceptualization than less
prominent ones. The prominence of a Ref0 can, for
example, be due to its perceptual saliency (cf. Flores
d&apos;Arcais 1987), its conceptual accessibility (i.e., the ease
with which it can be retrieved from memory; cf. Bock &amp;
Warren 1985) or its sortal properties (such as animacy,

humanness, etc.; cf. Bock et al. 1992). We assume that
the Conceptualizer&apos;s output representation is a stream -
formally: a list - of RefO/RefN fragments; the position
on the list indicates the order of conceptualization,
which in turn is the order in which these fragments
(&amp;quot;increments&amp;quot;) are made available to the Formulator for
syntactic and phonological encoding.
Furthermore, we assume coherence among conceptual
increments. This means, in technical terms of formal
representation, that RefOs are linked by certain means,
most notably by what we call embedding information.
Embedding information is one instance of a RefO&apos;s con-
nection with its conceptual environment. As an exam-
ple, embedding information characterizes a RefO&apos;s the-
matic role in event types and other sorts of situations to
varying degrees of specification.

</sectionHeader>
<construct confidence="0.673858777777778">
The SYNPHONICS Formulator, which is a formulation
component for German sentence production, consists of
three sub-components: the semantic encoder, which
transforms the conceptual input structure CS into an
abstract semantic representation SR (cf. Bierwisch &amp;
Schreuder 1992); the syntactic encoder, which, on the
basis of SR, selects lexical items and forms an abstract
syntactic representation; the phonological encoder,
which forms an abstract phonological representation.2

<bodyText confidence="0.999405666666667">
Syntactic structures are constructed incrementally, using
two types of SR information. At the semantics-syntax
interface, the so-called Scheme Selector employs the
(possibly underspecified) embedding information associ-
ated with RefOs in order to select abstract X-bar-
schemata in the form of minimally specified HPSG-like
feature structures, such as a complementation scheme,
which reflects a functor-argument relation, or an adjunc-
tion scheme, which reflects a modifier-modified relation.
Thereby, the top-down construction of syntactic struc-
ture is triggered. At the semantics-lexicon interface, the
so-called Lemma Selector uses the sortal attributes and
property or relation specifications of RefOs in order to
select the appropriate lexical items, whose syntactic
specifications serve as the starting point for the bottom-
up projection of phrasal structures.
Both top-down information and bottom-up information
pass through the so-called Functional Inspector, where
they are checked for the requirements of functional com-
pleteness of lexical items with regard to their semantic
demands. These concern, for example, determiners and
case-marking prepositions as well as passive auxiliaries.
If necessary, the Functional Inspector initiates a further
consultation of the lexicon.
Each newly formed syntactic structure must be licensed
by a set of HPSG-style declarative grammatical princi-
ples. In the case of lexical bottom-up information, the
principles mainly effect phrasal feature projection (Head
Feature Principle, Subcategorization Principle,
Semantics Principle). As regards the top-down struc-
tures, the principles serve to enrich the structural infor-
mation specified so far (Immediate Dominance
Schemata, Subcategorization Principle, etc.).
Next, the so-called Integrator takes the floor, which con-
structs a dynamic syntactic, phonological and semantic
representation underlying the utterance segment cur-
rently being generated. The construction proceeds incre-
mentally and monotonous; the only operation available
to the Integrator is unification of feature structures3.
The procedural execution of integration is guided by a
number of heuristics that reflect the need to meet the
demands of rapid utterance production. One important
heuristic principle crucial to the present topic is the fol-
lowing: &amp;quot;Integrate phonologically filled material as soon
as possible into the highest and leftmost position avail-
able in the current utterance fragment.&amp;quot; The newly
formed increment representation is again subject to the
grammatical licensing principles.

Before we proceed to the application of our process
model to the production of passive sentences, we will
sketch the basic features of the present SYNPHONICS
account of the syntax of the passive.
The traditional HPSG-account of the passive (Pollard &amp;
Sag 1987) consists in a lexical rule that simply restruc-
tures the elements on the SUBCAT list of a verb. The
application of the lexical rule to the basic active entry of

case of repairs or restarts), the formalism underlying the
SYNPHONICS approach must be extended; cf. de Smedfs

formerly highest NP, i.e., the subject, may occupy the
lowest oblique position, while the former direct object
NP takes the subject position. The initial account has
since been modified repeatedly; we simply mention T.
Kiss&apos; proposal for German,4 according to which the
passive rule is split into two parts, a rule of Subject
Demotion and a Subject Condition, which roughly cor-
responds to a rule of Object Promotion.
Rather than merely stipulating lexical rules such as
Subject Demotion and Object Promotion, the
SYNPHONICS account traces the effects these rules are
intended to capture to properties of the argument struc-
tures of the passive participle and the passive auxiliary.5
The morphological operation of passive participle for-
mation gives rise to what might be regarded as an &amp;quot;erga-
tivization&amp;quot; of the verb, i.e., the verb&apos;s external argument
(in the sense of Williams 1983) is exempt from any
syntactic principle that refers to subcategorized-for
arguments. (Technically, this is realized by transferring
the argument, which is marked by a special externality
feature, from the verb&apos;s SUBCAT list to a blocked-
argument [BLOCICED_ARG] list.6) The passive auxil-
iary is treated as an argument-attraction verb (cf.
Hinrichs &amp; Nakazawa 1991): It subcategorizes for a
passive participle and attracts the arguments that the par-
ticiple subcategorizes for as its own subcategorized-for
arguments. Argument attraction is a mechanism that
affects only the argument structure of the governed verb,
but does not affect the primary link between semantic
roles and arguments. The resulting SUBCAT list of the
verbal complex is subject to the relevant grammatical
principles, as usual. In the case of the German passive
auxiliary werden, which we treat as an ergative raising
verb, the blocked external argument of the participle
cannot be attracted. Rather, the corresponding parameter
in the semantics will be existentially bound (if there is

5 Note that this approach is intended to capture the
formation of the passive in morphologically rich
languages such as German and Dutch, where passivization
is essentially a morphological process. A different
parametrical variation, such as the development of the
auxiliary into a syntactic category in English, may lead to a
passive construction that requires an analysis in syntactic
terms.

On this basis, the effects of Object Promotion follow
from the Subcategorization Principle and a structural
case theory that replaces the original lexical case theory
of Pollard &amp; Sag (1987, 1992; cf. Pollard 1991).
Technically, arguments in the lexical entry of a verb are
marked by a case-type feature. The Subcategorization
Principle handles the arguments of the verbal complex
in the usual way. The new Case Principle either realizes
the structural case type by a nominative or accusative
value (in languages such as German and English), or
checks for the instantiation of the values for the lexical
case type. Due to our structural case theory, we reject an
isomorphic relation between the order of elements on
the SUBCAT list and the so-called hierarchy of gram-
matical functions fixed in the lexicon. Rather, we define
grammatical functions, quite GB-like, in structural
terms. From this angle, the order of elements on the
SUBCAT list is nothing but a lexically fixed default
prominence order of arguments. If the first argument on
the basic SUBCAT list of a verb has been blocked, i.e.,
relegated to the BLOCICED_ARG list, the first subcate-
gorized-for argument has to be integrated in the highest
accessible structural position, were it receives nomina-
tive case by means of the Case Principle.

We note in passing that the theory makes the correct
predictions for German impersonal passives, i.e., pas-
sives without nominatively marked NPs, such as Hier
wird getanzt [&apos;here be (3 sg) danced], Den Mannern wird
geholfen [&apos;the men (dat pl) be (3 sg) helped] and Der
Opfer wird gedacht [&apos;the victims (gen pl) be (3 sg)
remembered]. Since the passive auxiliary attracts all
(non-blocked) argument NPs of the participle, imper-
sonal passives are automatically formed if the partici-
ple&apos;s SUBCAT list is empty (as in the case of getanzt)
or contains argument NPs with lexically marked case
only (as in the case of geholfen and gedacht). In the lat-
ter case, the argument NPs keep their lexically marked
morphological form. Impersonal passives lack subjects
simply because the least oblique argument NP cannot be
structurally case-marked as nominative.

5 The Production of Passives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967692307692">
We differentiate between two types of stimuli that trig-
ger the production of passive sentences. The first is a
stimulus external to the linguistic system; the second is
a stimulus internal to the linguistic system. The two
types exemplify different ways in which the relevant
cognitive modules - the Conceptualizer and the
Formulator - are synchronized in order to jointly per-
form the task of producing an utterance.
The first case can be traced to a condition concerning the
content of the conceptual structure CS that the
Conceptualizer delivers to the Formulator. CS may
include a situation-type concept (e.g., an event-type
concept) that is marked for an agentive thematic role,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995264">

<bodyText confidence="0.999475538461539">
without at the same time including the corresponding
agentive Ref0. In terms of its underlying cognitive
function, this is an extreme case of what has been
described as &amp;quot;agent backgrounding&amp;quot; in the typological
literature (e.g., Foley &amp; van Valin 1985 and Keenan
1985). There are various motivations for agent back-
grounding; the most notable ones are the following:
there is a particularly salient or easily inferable agent
(e.g., Frank Rijkaard was sent off for knocking down
his opponent); the agent is unknown (e.g., My car has
been stolen); the situation-type predicate alone is
focused, with a corresponding defocusing of the agent
(e.g., German impersonal passives of the sort Heute
abend wird hier getanzt [&apos;there will be a dance here
tonight&apos;; literally: &amp;quot;tonight is here danced&amp;quot;]). The pas-
sive formation device allows the Formulator to follow
the Conceptualizer&apos;s decision to dispense with the agent
Ref0. Thus, the two modules&apos; principles of information
processing tally with each other.
More concretely, we assume that the production process
involves the following crucial steps: The Conceptualizer
delivers a situation type increment whose agent role
remains unspecified (or has as yet not been specified).
The Lemma Selector chooses an item that matches the
corresponding semantic representation. Since this is a
situational relation lacking its first argument, the par-
ticiple form of the lemma, whose category is adjectival,
is selected. The Functional Inspector completes the cat-
egorial requirements of the situation type increment,
which actually calls for a verbal category, by initiating a
call to the appropriate auxiliary (i.e., werden). The com-
plex form gives rise to a verbal projection whose exter-
nal argument appears on the BLOCICED_ARG list and
therefore is not subject to the Subcategorization
Principle. The corresponding parameter is existentially
bound in the semantics. Thus, the verbal projection sat-
isfies the grammatical licensing conditions for construc-
tions with non-subcategorized-for external arguments.
The second case can be traced to a processing strategy
that the Formulator employs when it has to react to the
Conceptualizer&apos;s selection of a particular Ref() as the
most prominent referential CS constituent, especially
under the constraints of rapid utterance production. In
general, as soon as one process component delivers an
informational increment to its successor component, the
latter strives for further processing the increment with-
out delay. As was claimed above, a certain Ref0 may be
the first increment that the Conceptualizer passes to the
Formulator due to its being the most prominent concep-
tual unit in the CS selected for verbalization. Now, a
prominent Ref° argument may often be made available
to the Formulator although its embedding information,
such as information about its thematic role in an event
type, is unspecified or at least underdetermined. In par-
ticular, the Ref0 may be passed to the Formulator prior
to the situation-type concept to which it is an argument.
In such cases, the Formulator follows the strategy to
assign to the syntactic phrase that verbalizes the Ref0
the most prominent available position in the current
utterance segment - i.e., in general, the structural sub-
ject position- without waiting for information about the
RefO&apos;s thematic role.7 However, if it turns out sub-
sequently that the phrase, due to information about the
thematic role of the corresponding Ref0 available later
on, does not show the regular argument properties of
subjects, principles guiding the Lemma Selection pro-
cess force the formation of a passive sentence.
In this case, the production process involves the follow-
ing crucial steps: The Ref0 increment is passed from
the Conceptualizer to the Formulator prior to the situa-
tion type increment. Following the above mentioned
integration heuristic, the Integrator inserts the phrase
corresponding to the Ref0 into the most prominent syn-
tactic position, where it receives the nominative case by
the structural Case Principle. No specific information
about the RefO&apos;s thematic role has been used so far. At
some stage in the process, however, such information
must become available to the Formulator. We assume
that this occurs when the situation type increment enters
the Formulator. Lemma Selection is restricted not only
by the corresponding SR, but also by information
linked to constituents already represented in the tempo-
rary utterance fragment constructed so far. In the present
case, the Formulator is equipped with additional embed-
ding information. It may turn out that the Ref0 whose
realizing phrase has already been integrated in the most
prominent position has the standard properties of an
internal argument, for example, because it is the theme
7 Abstracting from time factors, the subject position can,
in more general terms, be filled without paying attention to
the thematic role the Ref0 in question holds in a situation.
This is essentially suggested by experimental studies using
a picture-description task, where the presentation of the
depiction of an isolated object accompanies the
presentation of the depiction of the entire scene involving
the object (see, e.g., Turner &amp; Ronunetveit 1968). The
additional presentation of the patient object, which raises
its prominence in memory, often sets off the test subjects
on the passive voice. See also the study reported in
Tannenbaum &amp; Williams (1968), in which drawing the
speaker&apos;s attention to either the agent or the patient in a
situation by means of verbal cues, thereby manipulating
the speaker&apos;s memory access, also affected the choice of
verbal voice.

in an actional event type. (Technically, the relevant
embedding information is available via coindexing of
the semantics of the already integrated NP and the theme
argument of the situation type increment.) Lemma
Selection must take this information into account by
choosing a lemma with a theme as the highest subcate-
gorized-for argument (i.e., as the final argument to be
projected by the Subcategorization Principle). This is
exactly the property of the participle form of the lemma
appropriate to the situation type increment in question.
From here on, the process of passive sentence formation
proceeds as in the first case.

This is by far no complete account of the determinants
of the production of passive sentences. Rather, the aim
of the foregoing discussion was to sketch a computa-
tional model of natural language production that links
psycholinguistically established aspects of linguistic
performance with a competence model in the form of an
HPSG-style declarative grammatical knowledge base.
The crucial features of the process model are its incre-
mentality and highly constrained modularity. Each sub-
component of the overall process is governed by its own
set of principles, with no feedback between components.
We dealt with the relation between the pre-linguistic
conceptualizing component and the linguistic formula-
tion component in some detail in the present paper. The
Conceptualizer&apos;s mode of operation is guided by general
cognitive principles that, for example, select among the
ingredients of a situation those considered to be apt for
linguistic presentation and determine the order in which
units of the content to be expressed are passed on to the
linguistic component, in fact independent in principle of
requirements specific to the latter. The Formulator has a
number of language-system internal devices at its com-
mand to cope with the material delivered by the
Conceptualizer. The discussion of the production of pas-
sives served to illustrate how the SYNPHONICS genera-
tion system models this situation.

<abstract confidence="0.973966003610108">This paper sketches some basic features of the SYNPHONICS account of the computational modelling of incremental language production with the example of the generation of passive sentences. The SYNPHONICS approach aims at linking psycholinguistic insights into the nature of the human natural language production process with well-established assumptions in theoretical and computational linguistics concerning the representation and processing of knowledge. We differentiate two possible kinds of stimuli within the generation process that trigger the formation of passive sentences: a Formulator-external stimulus and a Formulator-internal one. The Formulator-external stimulus is determined by the conceptual/contextual condition of agent backgrounding: An agentless semantic representation is verbalized by way of constructing an ergativized verbal complex in the morphological structure-building component, rather than by mapping the semantic representation directly onto a passive lemma. The Formulator-internal stimulus is an effect of the constraints of rapid, incremental utterance in particular, it causes the Formulat- * The research reported in this paper is carried out in the research project &amp;quot;Sprachproduktion: von konzeptueller Struktur und Kontext zur prosodischen Realisierung der Bedeutung&amp;quot; at the University of Hamburg. The project is funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) under grant or to integrate a thematically underspecified increment in a prominent structural environment. In this case, the formation of passives is a matter of an additional constraint on the Lemma Selection process: Lemma Selection is constrained by the structural representation of the utterance produced so far. 1 Computational Modelling of Incremental Language Production This paper sketches some basic features of the SYNPHONICS account of the computational modelling of incremental language production with the example of generation of passive sentences. SYNPHONICS (&amp;quot;Syntactic and Phonological Realization of Incrementally Generated conceptual structures&amp;quot;) approach, which subscribes to a cognitive science perspective on language processing, aims at linking psycholinguistic insights into the nature of the human natural language production process with well-established assumptions in theoretical and computational linguistics concerning the representation and processing of grammatical knowledge. Research in psycholinguistics (e.g., Garrett 1988, Levelt 1989) has revealed that the process of converting a preverbal, conceptual content into overt speech is performed by a number of autonomous sub-processes specialized for different tasks within the overall process: the pre-linguistic conceptualization component (the Conceptualizer, in Levelt&apos;s terms) plans a content to be expressed and delivers a corresponding conceptual representation to the linguistic formulation component (the Formulator), which in turn selects the appropriate items (lemmas and lexemes) from the system&apos;s lexical data base and, guided by the syntactic and phonological specof the lexical items, produces abstract syntac- 3 tic and phonological representations. The output of the Formulator is taken up by the articulation component (the Articulator), whose task it is to produce a physical speech signal. These components are considered to be autonomous modules, whose modes of operation are each governed by their own sets of principles and restrictions. Furthermore, the system as a whole is constrained by there being a unidirectional flow of information, i.e., is no feedback between Finally, it is widely accepted that human language production proceeds in an incremental, piecemeal fashion (Kempen &amp; Hoenkamp 1987): Rather than having to wait for complete input structures, components are able to process fragmentary input (&amp;quot;increments&amp;quot;). As soon as a particular component has passed the results on to its successor component, it is ready for processing the next input increment. Thus, a given increment is processed sequentially by different components, whereas components may operate in parallel on different increments. Theoretical linguists of various persuasions converge on the idea that a large amount of grammatical information that former theories of grammar handled by extensive rule systems ought to be captured by detailed grammatical specifications of lexical items instead. From this angle, the grammar of a language merely consists of a small set of general licensing principles for structures projected from the lexicon. The present paper subscribes this view. More specifically, the Formulator uses a grammar for German in the mold of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard &amp; Sag 1987, 1992). The HPSG-style lexical approach to basic aspects of grammar tallies with the central role that recent psycholinguistic theories of language production assign to the lexicon in the formation of linguistic structures (lexicon-driven generation; e.g., Levelt 1989). In contrast to other approaches to the computational modelling of empirically substantiated features of human language production, such as Kempen &amp; Hoenlcamp&apos;s (1987) Incremental Procedural Grammar (1990) Incremental Parallel Formulator, the model distinguishes strictly between declarative grammatical knowledge and its procedural application, thus taking the stance of theoretical linguistics and related computational approaches. As in HPSG, the declarative grammatical knowledge of the SYNPHONICS Formulator is reprein a unification-based formalism with sorted fea- 1In contrast, Al models that are concerned with incremental processing (e.g., Reithinger 1992) often make extensive use of feedback at the cost of economy and cognitive adequacy. tare structures. Unlike deduction-based approaches to natural language generation in computational linguistics (e.g., Shieber et al. 1990), however, the SYNPHONICS approach involves a detailed and transparent process model, with sub-processes being explicitly specified at any point in the overall process. This property serves to make the model adjustable to empirical results about the course of human language production and open to a verification of its claims, namely to aim at the computational modelling of cognitive processes. In order to make the above considerations more concrete, we will discuss the roles of the Conceptualizer and the Formulator in the production of a particular linguistic construction in some more detail in the remainder of this paper. The discussion of the principles guiding the production of passive sentences serves to illustrate to what extent the determinants of this construction can be traced to the feedback-free interplay between the Conceptualizer and the Formulator and the constraints specific to the involved modules. We cannot go into the details of the passive here; rather, we will confine the presentation to some quite simple cases. In order to capture the full range of the passive construction across languages, the account presented here needs to be enlarged in parts. The The conceptual input into the Formulator in short: CS for &amp;quot;conceptual structure&amp;quot; is represented in the RefO/RefN format (Habel 1982, 1986a/b; Eschenbach et al. 1989). The basic representational units are Referential Objects (RefOs), which are stored and processed in a net-like structure, a Referential Net (RefN). RefOs are alia, sortal attributes and property and relation designations. The notion of RefOs comprises the entire range of discourse entities, such as objects, times, and situations (events, processes, states). The input representation reflects certain aspects of the organization of the information which the Conceptualizer delivers to the Formulator. One important dimension of organization is the relative prominence of conceptual units such as particular RefOs. In the incremental process of forming .a conceptual representation of the content to be expressed in an utterance, relative prominence can manifest itself in the time course of conceptualization, with more prominent units tending towards earlier conceptualization than less prominent ones. The prominence of a Ref0 can, for example, be due to its perceptual saliency (cf. Flores d&apos;Arcais 1987), its conceptual accessibility (i.e., the ease with which it can be retrieved from memory; cf. Bock &amp; Warren 1985) or its sortal properties (such as animacy, 4 humanness, etc.; cf. Bock et al. 1992). We assume that the Conceptualizer&apos;s output representation is a stream formally: a list of RefO/RefN fragments; the position on the list indicates the order of conceptualization, which in turn is the order in which these fragments (&amp;quot;increments&amp;quot;) are made available to the Formulator for syntactic and phonological encoding. Furthermore, we assume coherence among conceptual increments. This means, in technical terms of formal representation, that RefOs are linked by certain means, most notably by what we call embedding information. Embedding information is one instance of a RefO&apos;s connection with its conceptual environment. As an example, embedding information characterizes a RefO&apos;s thematic role in event types and other sorts of situations to varying degrees of specification. The The SYNPHONICS Formulator, which is a formulation component for German sentence production, consists of three sub-components: the semantic encoder, which transforms the conceptual input structure CS into an abstract semantic representation SR (cf. Bierwisch &amp; Schreuder 1992); the syntactic encoder, which, on the basis of SR, selects lexical items and forms an abstract syntactic representation; the phonological encoder, forms an abstract phonological Figure 1 (next page) shows the internal structure of the SYNPHONICS Formulator. structures constructed incrementally, using two types of SR information. At the semantics-syntax interface, the so-called Scheme Selector employs the (possibly underspecified) embedding information associated with RefOs in order to select abstract X-barschemata in the form of minimally specified HPSG-like feature structures, such as a complementation scheme, which reflects a functor-argument relation, or an adjunction scheme, which reflects a modifier-modified relation. Thereby, the top-down construction of syntactic structure is triggered. At the semantics-lexicon interface, the so-called Lemma Selector uses the sortal attributes and property or relation specifications of RefOs in order to select the appropriate lexical items, whose syntactic specifications serve as the starting point for the bottomup projection of phrasal structures. Both top-down information and bottom-up information pass through the so-called Functional Inspector, where they are checked for the requirements of functional completeness of lexical items with regard to their semantic demands. These concern, for example, determiners and case-marking prepositions as well as passive auxiliaries. If necessary, the Functional Inspector initiates a further consultation of the lexicon. Each newly formed syntactic structure must be licensed by a set of HPSG-style declarative grammatical principles. In the case of lexical bottom-up information, the principles mainly effect phrasal feature projection (Head Feature Principle, Subcategorization Principle, Semantics Principle). As regards the top-down structures, the principles serve to enrich the structural information specified so far (Immediate Dominance Schemata, Subcategorization Principle, etc.). Next, the so-called Integrator takes the floor, which constructs a dynamic syntactic, phonological and semantic representation underlying the utterance segment currently being generated. The construction proceeds incrementally and monotonous; the only operation available the Integrator is unification of feature The procedural execution of integration is guided by a number of heuristics that reflect the need to meet the demands of rapid utterance production. One important heuristic principle crucial to the present topic is the following: &amp;quot;Integrate phonologically filled material as soon as possible into the highest and leftmost position available in the current utterance fragment.&amp;quot; The newly formed increment representation is again subject to the grammatical licensing principles. 4 Morphology and Syntax of the Passive Before we proceed to the application of our process model to the production of passive sentences, we will sketch the basic features of the present SYNPHONICS account of the syntax of the passive. The traditional HPSG-account of the passive (Pollard &amp; Sag 1987) consists in a lexical rule that simply restructures the elements on the SUBCAT list of a verb. The application of the lexical rule to the basic active entry of 2We will not deal with the semantic and phonological encoder in the present paper; cf. Glinther et al. (1993), Abb et al. (1993) and the relevant papers in Herweg (ed., 1992). 3In order to capture nonmonotonic processes (as in the case of repairs or restarts), the formalism underlying the must be extended; cf. de Smedfs (1991) operation of non-destructive unification. 5 Conceptual Incremer SSP = Semantic/Syntactic/Phonological Figure 1: The SYNPHON1CS Formulator SSP- SCHEMES SSP- Scheme top-down information bottom-up information 14-1</abstract>

Rather than merely stipulating lexical rules such as Subject Demotion and Object Promotion, the traces the effects these rules are intended to capture to properties of the argument strucof the passive participle and the passive The morphological operation of passive participle formation gives rise to what might be regarded as an &amp;quot;ergativization&amp;quot; of the verb, i.e., the verb&apos;s external argument (in the sense of Williams 1983) is exempt from any syntactic principle that refers to subcategorized-for arguments. (Technically, this is realized by transferring the argument, which is marked by a special externality feature, from the verb&apos;s SUBCAT list to a blocked- [BLOCICED_ARG] The passive auxiliary is treated as an argument-attraction verb (cf. Hinrichs &amp; Nakazawa 1991): It subcategorizes for a passive participle and attracts the arguments that the participle subcategorizes for as its own subcategorized-for arguments. Argument attraction is a mechanism that affects only the argument structure of the governed verb, but does not affect the primary link between semantic roles and arguments. The resulting SUBCAT list of the verbal complex is subject to the relevant grammatical principles, as usual. In the case of the German passive we treat as an ergative raising verb, the blocked external argument of the participle cannot be attracted. Rather, the corresponding parameter in the semantics will be existentially bound (if there is 4as yet unpublished work at IBM Germany, Institute for Knowledge-based Systems, Stuttgart 5Note that this approach is intended to capture the formation of the passive in morphologically rich languages such as German and Dutch, where passivization is essentially a morphological process. A different parametrical variation, such as the development of the auxiliary into a syntactic category in English, may lead to a passive construction that requires an analysis in syntactic terms. 6The term &amp;quot;blocked argument&amp;quot; is borrowed from Haider (1984), who, however, introduced it in a different framework. no oblique agent phrase). Figure 2 shows the resulting structure of the German participle-auxiliary complex werdbitten). [ werd-^ SUBCAT&lt;NPD BLOCKEDAROID &amp;quot;gebissen&amp;quot; SUBCAT&lt;NPID. BLOCKED-ARO 2: Structural Description of a Auxiliary Complex On this basis, the effects of Object Promotion follow from the Subcategorization Principle and a structural case theory that replaces the original lexical case theory of Pollard &amp; Sag (1987, 1992; cf. Pollard 1991). Technically, arguments in the lexical entry of a verb are marked by a case-type feature. The Subcategorization Principle handles the arguments of the verbal complex in the usual way. The new Case Principle either realizes the structural case type by a nominative or accusative value (in languages such as German and English), or checks for the instantiation of the values for the lexical case type. Due to our structural case theory, we reject an relation order of elements on the SUBCAT list and the so-called hierarchy of grammatical functions fixed in the lexicon. Rather, we define grammatical functions, quite GB-like, in structural terms. From this angle, the order of elements on the SUBCAT list is nothing but a lexically fixed default prominence order of arguments. If the first argument on the basic SUBCAT list of a verb has been blocked, i.e., relegated to the BLOCICED_ARG list, the first subcategorized-for argument has to be integrated in the highest accessible structural position, were it receives nominative case by means of the Case Principle. Figure 3 shows the structural description of the German sentence Peter gebissen wird Peter is bitten&apos;). T is the category of the functional element Tense; V/T is a finite verbal projection.

Since the passive auxiliary attracts all (non-blocked) argument NPs of the participle, impersonal passives are automatically formed if the partici- SUBCAT list is empty (as in the case of or contains argument NPs with lexically marked case (as in the case of the latter case, the argument NPs keep their lexically marked morphological form. Impersonal passives lack subjects simply because the least oblique argument NP cannot be structurally case-marked as nominative. 5 The Production of Passives We differentiate between two types of stimuli that trigger the production of passive sentences. The first is a stimulus external to the linguistic system; the second is a stimulus internal to the linguistic system. The two types exemplify different ways in which the relevant cognitive modules the Conceptualizer and the Formulator are synchronized in order to jointly perform the task of producing an utterance. The first case can be traced to a condition concerning the content of the conceptual structure CS that the Conceptualizer delivers to the Formulator. CS may include a situation-type concept (e.g., an event-type concept) that is marked for an agentive thematic role, 8 without at the same time including the corresponding agentive Ref0. In terms of its underlying cognitive function, this is an extreme case of what has been described as &amp;quot;agent backgrounding&amp;quot; in the typological literature (e.g., Foley &amp; van Valin 1985 and Keenan 1985). There are various motivations for agent backgrounding; the most notable ones are the following: there is a particularly salient or easily inferable agent Rijkaard was sent off for knocking down opponent); agent is unknown My car has stolen); situation-type predicate alone is focused, with a corresponding defocusing of the agent German impersonal passives of the sort wird hier getanzt will be a dance here tonight&apos;; literally: &amp;quot;tonight is here danced&amp;quot;]). The passive formation device allows the Formulator to follow the Conceptualizer&apos;s decision to dispense with the agent Ref0. Thus, the two modules&apos; principles of information processing tally with each other. More concretely, we assume that the production process involves the following crucial steps: The Conceptualizer delivers a situation type increment whose agent role remains unspecified (or has as yet not been specified). The Lemma Selector chooses an item that matches the corresponding semantic representation. Since this is a situational relation lacking its first argument, the participle form of the lemma, whose category is adjectival, is selected. The Functional Inspector completes the categorial requirements of the situation type increment, which actually calls for a verbal category, by initiating a to the appropriate auxiliary werden). complex form gives rise to a verbal projection whose external argument appears on the BLOCICED_ARG list and therefore is not subject to the Subcategorization Principle. The corresponding parameter is existentially bound in the semantics. Thus, the verbal projection satisfies the grammatical licensing conditions for constructions with non-subcategorized-for external arguments. The second case can be traced to a processing strategy that the Formulator employs when it has to react to the Conceptualizer&apos;s selection of a particular Ref() as the most prominent referential CS constituent, especially under the constraints of rapid utterance production. In general, as soon as one process component delivers an informational increment to its successor component, the latter strives for further processing the increment without delay. As was claimed above, a certain Ref0 may be the first increment that the Conceptualizer passes to the Formulator due to its being the most prominent conceptual unit in the CS selected for verbalization. Now, a prominent Ref° argument may often be made available to the Formulator although its embedding information, such as information about its thematic role in an event type, is unspecified or at least underdetermined. In particular, the Ref0 may be passed to the Formulator prior to the situation-type concept to which it is an argument. In such cases, the Formulator follows the strategy to assign to the syntactic phrase that verbalizes the Ref0 the most prominent available position in the current utterance segment i.e., in general, the structural subject positionwithout waiting for information about the thematic However, if it turns out subsequently that the phrase, due to information about the thematic role of the corresponding Ref0 available later on, does not show the regular argument properties of subjects, principles guiding the Lemma Selection process force the formation of a passive sentence. In this case, the production process involves the following crucial steps: The Ref0 increment is passed from the Conceptualizer to the Formulator prior to the situation type increment. Following the above mentioned integration heuristic, the Integrator inserts the phrase corresponding to the Ref0 into the most prominent syntactic position, where it receives the nominative case by the structural Case Principle. No specific information about the RefO&apos;s thematic role has been used so far. At some stage in the process, however, such information must become available to the Formulator. We assume that this occurs when the situation type increment enters the Formulator. Lemma Selection is restricted not only by the corresponding SR, but also by information linked to constituents already represented in the temporary utterance fragment constructed so far. In the present case, the Formulator is equipped with additional embedding information. It may turn out that the Ref0 whose realizing phrase has already been integrated in the most prominent position has the standard properties of an internal argument, for example, because it is the theme 7Abstracting from time factors, the subject position can, in more general terms, be filled without paying attention to the thematic role the Ref0 in question holds in a situation. This is essentially suggested by experimental studies using a picture-description task, where the presentation of the depiction of an isolated object accompanies the presentation of the depiction of the entire scene involving the object (see, e.g., Turner &amp; Ronunetveit 1968). The additional presentation of the patient object, which raises its prominence in memory, often sets off the test subjects on the passive voice. See also the study reported in Tannenbaum &amp; Williams (1968), in which drawing the speaker&apos;s attention to either the agent or the patient in a situation by means of verbal cues, thereby manipulating the speaker&apos;s memory access, also affected the choice of verbal voice. 9 in an actional event type. (Technically, the relevant embedding information is available via coindexing of the semantics of the already integrated NP and the theme argument of the situation type increment.) Lemma Selection must take this information into account by choosing a lemma with a theme as the highest subcategorized-for argument (i.e., as the final argument to be projected by the Subcategorization Principle). This is exactly the property of the participle form of the lemma appropriate to the situation type increment in question. From here on, the process of passive sentence formation proceeds as in the first case. 6 Conclusions This is by far no complete account of the determinants of the production of passive sentences. Rather, the aim of the foregoing discussion was to sketch a computational model of natural language production that links psycholinguistically established aspects of linguistic performance with a competence model in the form of an HPSG-style declarative grammatical knowledge base. The crucial features of the process model are its incrementality and highly constrained modularity. Each subcomponent of the overall process is governed by its own set of principles, with no feedback between components. We dealt with the relation between the pre-linguistic conceptualizing component and the linguistic formulation component in some detail in the present paper. The Conceptualizer&apos;s mode of operation is guided by general cognitive principles that, for example, select among the ingredients of a situation those considered to be apt for linguistic presentation and determine the order in which units of the content to be expressed are passed on to the linguistic component, in fact independent in principle of requirements specific to the latter.

The traditional HPSG-account of the passive (Pollard &amp; Sag 1987) consists in a lexical rule that simply restructures the elements on the SUBCAT list of a verb. The application of the lexical rule to the basic active entry of 2 We will not deal with the semantic and phonological encoder in the present paper; cf. Glinther et al. (1993), Abb et al. (1993) and the relevant papers in Herweg (ed., 1992). 3 In order to capture nonmonotonic processes (as in the case of repairs or restarts), the formalism underlying the SYNPHONICS approach must be extended; cf. de Smedfs (1991) operation of non-destructive unification. 5 Conceptual Incremer SSP = Semantic/Syntactic/Phonological Figure 1: The SYNPHON1CS Formulator SSPSCHEMES SSPScheme top-down information 1-41 bottom-up information Functional Inspector 14-1 Structu&apos;) Semantic Encod Semantic Representation Scheme Selector Lemma Selector Lemmata LEXICON Lexemes t Dynamic SSPStructures Integrator SSP-St</context>

Embedding information is one instance of a RefO&apos;s connection with its conceptual environment. As an example, embedding information characterizes a RefO&apos;s thematic role in event types and other sorts of situations to varying degrees of specification. 3 The SYNPHONICS Formulator The SYNPHONICS Formulator, which is a formulation component for German sentence production, consists of three sub-components: the semantic encoder, which transforms the conceptual input structure CS into an abstract semantic representation SR (cf. Bierwisch &amp; Schreuder 1992); the syntactic encoder, which, on the basis of SR, selects lexical items and forms an abstract syntactic representation; the phonological encoder, which forms an abstract phonological representation.2 Figure 1 (next page) shows the internal structure of the SYNPHONICS Formulator. Syntactic structures are constructed incrementally, using two types of SR information. At the semantics-syntax interface, the so-called Scheme Selector employs the (possibly underspecified) embedding information associated with RefOs in order to select abstract X-barschemata in the form of minimally specified HPSG-li</context>

The SYNPHONICS (&amp;quot;Syntactic and Phonological Realization of Incrementally Generated conceptual structures&amp;quot;) approach, which subscribes to a cognitive science perspective on language processing, aims at linking psycholinguistic insights into the nature of the human natural language production process with well-established assumptions in theoretical and computational linguistics concerning the representation and processing of grammatical knowledge. Research in psycholinguistics (e.g., Garrett 1988, Levelt 1989) has revealed that the process of converting a preverbal, conceptual content into overt speech is performed by a number of autonomous sub-processes specialized for different tasks within the overall process: the pre-linguistic conceptualization component (the Conceptualizer, in Levelt&apos;s terms) plans a content to be expressed and delivers a corresponding conceptual representation to the linguistic formulation component (the Formulator), which in turn selects the appropriate items (lemmas and lexemes) from the system&apos;s lexical data base and, guided by the syntactic and phonological</context>

There are various motivations for agent backgrounding; the most notable ones are the following: there is a particularly salient or easily inferable agent (e.g., Frank Rijkaard was sent off for knocking down his opponent); the agent is unknown (e.g., My car has been stolen); the situation-type predicate alone is focused, with a corresponding defocusing of the agent (e.g., German impersonal passives of the sort Heute abend wird hier getanzt [&apos;there will be a dance here tonight&apos;; literally: &amp;quot;tonight is here danced&amp;quot;]).

The output of the Formulator is taken up by the articulation component (the Articulator), whose task it is to produce a physical speech signal. These components are considered to be autonomous modules, whose modes of operation are each governed by their own sets of principles and restrictions. Furthermore, the system as a whole is constrained by there being a unidirectional flow of information, i.e., there is no feedback between sub-processes.1 Finally, it is widely accepted that human language production proceeds in an incremental, piecemeal fashion (Kempen &amp; Hoenkamp 1987): Rather than having to wait for complete input structures, components are able to process fragmentary input (&amp;quot;increments&amp;quot;). As soon as a particular component has passed the results on to its successor component, it is ready for processing the next input increment. Thus, a given increment is processed sequentially by different components, whereas components may operate in parallel on different increments.

The SYNPHONICS (&amp;quot;Syntactic and Phonological Realization of Incrementally Generated conceptual structures&amp;quot;) approach, which subscribes to a cognitive science perspective on language processing, aims at linking psycholinguistic insights into the nature of the human natural language production process with well-established assumptions in theoretical and computational linguistics concerning the representation and processing of grammatical knowledge. Research in psycholinguistics (e.g., Garrett 1988, Levelt 1989) has revealed that the process of converting a preverbal, conceptual content into overt speech is performed by a number of autonomous sub-processes specialized for different tasks within the overall process: the pre-linguistic conceptualization component (the Conceptualizer, in Levelt&apos;s terms) plans a content to be expressed and delivers a corresponding conceptual representation to the linguistic formulation component (the Formulator), which in turn selects the appropriate items (lemmas and lexemes) from the system&apos;s lexical data base and, guided by the syntactic and phonological specification</context>

From this angle, the grammar of a language merely consists of a small set of general licensing principles for structures projected from the lexicon. The present paper subscribes to this view. More specifically, the SYNPHONICS Formulator uses a grammar for German in the mold of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard &amp; Sag 1987, 1992). The HPSG-style lexical approach to basic aspects of grammar tallies with the central role that recent psycholinguistic theories of language production assign to the lexicon in the formation of linguistic structures (lexicon-driven generation; e.g., Levelt 1989). In contrast to other approaches to the computational modelling of empirically substantiated features of human language production, such as Kempen &amp; Hoenlcamp&apos;s (1987) Incremental Procedural Grammar and de Smedt&apos;s (1990) Incremental Parallel Formulator, however, the SYNPHONICS process model distinguishes strictly between declarative grammatical knowledge and its procedural application, thus taking the stance of theoretical linguistics and related computational approaches.

The additional presentation of the patient object, which raises its prominence in memory, often sets off the test subjects on the passive voice.

Rather than merely stipulating lexical rules such as Subject Demotion and Object Promotion, the SYNPHONICS account traces the effects these rules are intended to capture to properties of the argument structures of the passive participle and the passive auxiliary.5 The morphological operation of passive participle formation gives rise to what might be regarded as an &amp;quot;ergativization&amp;quot; of the verb, i.e., the verb&apos;s external argument (in the sense of Williams 1983) is exempt from any syntactic principle that refers to subcategorized-for arguments.
