A Note from the Editor
It is a great pleasure for me to see the journal now being published by the MIT Press. We have
managed to do this without having to change the way the journal relates to the ACL. The journal
remains a membership benefit of the ACL and all renewals, address changes and other
correspondence for individual memberships will be with the ACL offices as before. Institutional
members, however, will now be dealing directly with the MIT Press. Submissions to the journal
should continue to be made to the appropriate editor as indicated on the inside back cover.
This first issue of Volume 14 is late due to the complexities involved in changing our production
procedure. We are already in production on the next issue, however, and expect to be caught up
by the end of the year. The journal will then appear on its regular quarterly schedule with Volume
15. The irregularity of publication this year should be a minor inconvenience compared to the long-
term benefits of these changes.
Because of the excellent growth of the journal in the last two years, we have now made the finite
string into a separate publication in order to allow more space for technical papers. In general,
there will be the equivalent of four full technical papers in each issue, an expanded book review
section, plus the occasional technical correspondences and letters to the editor. In addition,
abstracts of current literature will continue to be included in the journal, while site reports,
announcements, and the calendar of upcoming events will be in the new Finite String newsletter.
There are two exciting special issues to appear in this year&apos;s volume. Issue 14-2 is a special issue
consisting of five papers on tense and aspect edited by Bonnie Lynn Webber. Issue 14-3 will be
another special issue consisting of five papers on user modelling edited by Alfred Kobsa and
Wolfgang Wahlster. It also contains an extended discussion section on the relationship between
user models and discourse models. I personally find special issues particularly valuable and
actively encourage anyone who has a suggestion for a topic, or who would be interested in editing
such an issue, to please contact me.
It is a time of great transition for the ACL. Our membership continues to grow and the amount
of activity in the field, as measured by the number of quality submissions to the journal and the
ACL conferences, is increasing dramatically. The reorganization of the journal is an attempt to
respond to the new needs of the society. If you have any suggestions for new features you would
like to see in the journal or Finite String, or have comments or criticisms of our current format,
please let us know.
