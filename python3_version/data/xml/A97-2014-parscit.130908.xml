1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939875">
We present a prototype grammar checker for En-
glish as a Second Language (ESL) students, utilizing
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) written in
SICStus Prolog. Instead of attempting to handle all
possible grammatical errors, the grammar checker
identifies certain specific types of grammatical mis-
takes that appear more regularly than others in the
present domain of application.

2 Grammatical Mistakes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959111111111">
The current project started as part of a collabora-
tion between the Computer and Information Science
department and the English Language Programs at
the University of Pennsylvania in an effort to provide
a computational tool for students who are learning
English as a second language. As an initial attempt,
the present implementation focuses on certain dom-
inant types of syntactic mistakes, as identified from
the available set of students&apos; essays.
The kind of mistakes that are detected by the
current system includes: Wrong capitalization (sen-
tence initial, wrong lowercase/uppercase initial let-
ter), missing fragments (subjects, objects, some
prepositions, complements, articles, clauses, the,
than, etc), some extra elements (e.g., the infini-
tive marker after auxiliary verbs), wrong agreement
(number, case, etc), wrong verb form, and various
mismatches (verb tense with adverbs, etc).

Grammar Formalism

In order to handle ungrammatical expressions as
well as grammatical ones, we utilized the syntac-
tic domain of locality implicit in categorial lexi-
cal entries under the CCG framework, by includ-
ing known variations of categorial association in the
lexical entries. Multiple parts-of-speech are handled
by putting all the assertions regarding grammatical
parts-of-speech before those regarding ungrammati-
cal ones.

4 Categorial Lexicon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998254882352941">
In constructing a categorial lexicon for the grammar,
we used an existing grammar-independent lexicon
that had been made available as part of the XTAG
project at the University of Pennsylvania. The orig-
inal public domain lexicon contains about 37K quin-
tuples, (INDEX, ENTRY, POS, CAT, Fs), where POS
and CAT are associated with a part-of-speech (such
as V or N) and a set of categories, respectively, for
the lexical item associated with ENTRY. The lexi-
cal items are supplemented by a morphology table,
which has about 317K entries for various grammati-
cal inflections. We have also made use of public do-
main word lists and consulted an on-line electronic
dictionary for more commonly used lexical items.
At the moment, the lexicon has about 18K nouns,
6.5K adjectives, 4.5K transitive verbs, 2K intransi-
tive verbs, among other categories.

The user interface of the system includes a direct
interaction with the Prolog interpreter, as well as an
Internet interface. The Internet interface is written
in HTML and CGI/PERL, which invokes the run-
time image of the Prolog code.
The project is still at an initial stage and there are
many other issues that need to be addressed, such as
performance and coverage of the mistake types. We
believe that the use of a standard linguistic theory
such as CCG made it possible to develop a grammar
checker in a very short time frame and limited man
power, as the existing large standard lexicons are be
made readily available for it. Pending further fund-
ing, we believe that the prototype grammar checker
can be brought up to an industry strength.

We appreciate the students who agreed to provide
their essays for the present project. We also thank
our beta testers, especially Laura Siegel and Jinah
Park, who have shared their time to test the system.
