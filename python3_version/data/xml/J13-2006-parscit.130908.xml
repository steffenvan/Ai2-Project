In computational modeling of natural language phenomena, there are at least three
modes of research. The currently dominant statistical paradigm typically prioritizes
instance coverage: Data-driven methods seek to use as much information observed in
data as possible in order to generalize linguistic analyses to unseen instances. A second
approach prioritizes detailed description of grammatical phenomena, that is, forming
and defending theories with a focus on a small number of instances. A third approach
might be called integrative: Rather than addressing phenomena in isolation, different
approaches are brought together to address multiple challenges in a unified framework,
and the behavior of the system is demonstrated with a small number of instances. Design
Patterns in Fluid Construction Grammar (DPFCG) exemplifies the third approach, intro-
ducing a linguistic formalism called Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG) that addresses
parsing, production, and learning in a single computational framework.
The book emphasizes grammar-engineering, following broad-coverage descrip-
tive paradigms that can be traced back to Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar
(GPSG) (Gazdar et al. 1985), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan 2000), Head-
Driven Phrase-Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Sag and Wasow 1999), and Combinatory
Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman 1996). In all of these cases, a formal meta-
framework allows computational linguists to formalize their hypotheses and intuitions
about a language’s grammatical behavior and then explore how these representational
choices affect the processing of natural language utterances. Many of the aforemen-
tioned approaches have engendered large-scale platforms that can be used and reused
to provide formal description of grammars for different languages, such as Par-Gram
for LFG (Butt et al. 2002) and the LinGO Grammar Matrix for HPSG (Bender, Flickinger,
and Oepen 2002).
FCG offers a similar grammar engineering framework that follows the principles
of Construction Grammar (CxG) (Goldberg 2003; Hoffmann and Trousdale 2013). CxG
treats constructions as the basic units of grammatical organization in language. The con-
structions are viewed as learned associations between form (e.g., sounds, morphemes,
syntactic phrases) and function (semantics, pragmatics, discourse meaning, etc.). CxG
does not impose a strict separation between lexicon and grammar—indeed, it is per-
haps best known as treating semi-productive idioms like “the X-er, the Y-er” and
“X let alone Y” on equal footing with lexemes and “core” syntactic patterns (Fillmore,

Kay, and O’Connor 1988; Kay and Fillmore 1999). FCG, like other CxG formalisms—
namely, Embodied Construction Grammar (Bergen and Chang 2005; Feldman, Dodge,
and Bryant 2009) and Sign-Based Construction Grammar (Boas and Sag 2012)—is
unification-based.1 The studies in this book describe constructions and how they can
be combined in order to model natural language interpretation or generation as feature
structure unification in a general search procedure.
The book has five parts, covering the groundwork, basic linguistic applications,
processing matters, advanced case studies, and, finally, features of FCG that make it
fluid and robust. Each chapter identifies general strategies (design patterns) that might
merit reuse in new FCG grammars, or perhaps in other computational frameworks.
Part I. Introduction lays the groundwork for the rest of the book. “Introducing Fluid
Construction Grammar” (by Luc Steels) presents the aims of the FCG formalism. FCG
was designed as a framework for describing linguistic units (constructions—their form
and meaning), with an emphasis on language variation and evolution (“fluidity”). The
constructionist approach to language is described and the argument for applying it to
study language variation and change is defended. Psychological validity is explicitly
ruled out as a modeling goal (“The emphasis is on getting working systems, and this
is difficult enough”; page 4). The architects of FCG set out to include both sides of
the processing coin, however—parsing (interpretation) and production (generation).
The concept of search in processing is emphasized, though some of the explanations
of processing steps are too abstract for the reader to comprehend at this point. A
further desideratum—robustness to noisy input containing disfluencies, fragments, and
errors—is given as motivating a constructionist approach.
The next chapter, “A First Encounter with Fluid Construction Grammar”
(by Steels), describes the mechanisms of FCG in detail. In FCG, a working analysis
hypothesized in processing is known as transient structure; the transduction of form to
meaning (and vice versa) selects a sequence of constructions that apply to the transient
structure to gradually expand it until reaching a final analysis. Identifying construc-
tions that may apply to a transient structure presents a non-trivial search problem,
also addressed by the architects of FCG. The sheer number of technical details make
this chapter somewhat overwhelming. Most of the chapter is devoted to the low-level
feature structures and the operations manipulating them. Templates—a practical means
of avoiding boilerplate code when defining constructions—are then introduced, and do
most of the heavy lifting in the rest of the book.
In Part II. Grammatical Structures, we begin to see how constructions are defined in
practice. “A Design Pattern for Phrasal Constructions” (by Steels) illustrates how con-
structions are used to describe the combination of multiple units into higher-level, typed
phrases. Skeletal constructions compose with smaller units to form hierarchical struc-
tures (essentially similar to the Immediate Constituents Analysis of Bloomfield [1933]
and follow-up work in structuralist linguistics [Harris 1946]), and a range of additional
constructions impose form (e.g., ordering) constraints and add new meaning to the
newly created phrases. This chapter is of a tutorial nature, illustrating the step-by-step
application of four kinds of noun phrase constructions to expand transient structures
in processing. Over twenty templates are introduced in this chapter; they encapsulate
design patterns dealing with hierarchical structure, agreement, and feature percolation.

An aspect of phrasal constructions that is not yet dealt with is the complex linking of se-
mantic arguments and the morphosyntactic categorizations of the composed elements.
“A Design Pattern for Argument Structure Constructions” (by Remi van Trijp)
then builds on the formal machinery presented in the previous chapter to explicitly
address the complex mappings between semantic arguments (agent, patient, etc.) and
syntactic arguments (subject, object, etc.). This mapping is a complex matter due to
language-specific conceptualization of semantic arguments and different means of
morphosyntactic realization used by different languages. In FCG, each lexical item
introduces its linking potential in terms of the different types of semantic and syntactic
arguments that it may take, with no particular mapping between them. Each argument
structure construction imposes a partial mapping between the syntactic and semantic
arguments to yield a particular argument structure instantiation, one of the multiple
alternatives that may be available for a single lexical item. This account stands in sharp
contrast to the lexicalist view of argument-structure (the view taken in LFG, HPSG, and
CCG) whereby each lexical entry dictates all the necessary linking information. The
construction-based approach is defended for its ability to deal with unknown words2
and constructional coercion3 (Goldberg 1995). The argument structure design pattern
allows FCG to crudely recover a partial specification of the form-meaning mapping of
these elements, which is important for robust processing (see subsequent discussion).
Part III: Managing Processing addresses how FCG transduces between a linguistic
string and a meaning representation, where the two directions (parsing and production)
share a common declarative representation of linguistic knowledge (the grammar). This
entails assembling an analysis incrementally on the basis of the grammar, the input, and
any partial analysis that has already been created. With FCG (and unification grammars
more broadly) this search is nontrivial, and streamlining search (i.e., minimizing non-
determinism and avoiding dead ends) is a key motivator of many of the grammar
design patterns suggested in the book.
“Search in Linguistic Processing” (by Joris Bleys, Kevin Stadler, and Joachim De
Beule) deals mainly with the problem of choosing which of multiple compatible con-
structions to apply next. Whereas the default heuristic search in FCG is a greedy, depth-
first search (which can backtrack if the user-defined end-goal has not yet been achieved)
the FCG framework allows for a guided search through scores that reflect the relative
tendency of a construction to apply next. The authors suggest that such scoring can be
informed by general principles, for instance: (i) specific constructions are preferred to
more general ones, and (ii) previously co-applied constructions are preferred. Choosing
appropriate constructions to apply early on dramatically reduces the time needed for
processing the utterance.
“Organizing Constructions in Networks” (by Pieter Wellens) takes this idea to
the next level, and proposes to organize the different constructions in networks of
conditional dependencies. A conditional dependency links two constructions where
one provides necessary information for the application of the other. These dependency
networks can be updated whenever an input is processed so that the system learns
to search more efficiently when the same constructions are encountered in the future.
Using these networks to guide the search thus significantly reduces the search for
compatible constructions. An empirical effort to quantify this effect indeed shows a

sharp reduction in search time; unlike the held-out experimental paradigm accepted in
statistical NLP, however, the parsed/produced sentence is assumed to have been seen
already by the system.
Part IV: Case Studies addresses three challenging linguistic phenomena in FCG.
“Feature Matrices and Agreement” (by van Trijp) on German case offers a new
unification-based solution to the problem of feature indeterminacy. For instance, in the
sentence Er findet und hilft Frauen ‘He finds and helps women’, the first verb requires
an accusative object, whereas the second requires a dative object; the coordination
is allowed only because Frauen can be either accusative or dative. Kindern ‘children’,
which can only be dative, is not licensed here. Encoding case in a single feature on
the Frauen construction wouldn’t work because the feature would have to unify with
contradictory values (from the verbs’ inflectional features). Instead, case restrictions
specified lexically for a noun or verb can be expressed with a distinctive feature matrix,
with each matrix slot holding a variable or the value + or -. Unification then does
the right thing—allowing Frauen and forbidding Kindern—without resorting to type
hierarchies or disjunctive features.
“Construction Sets and Unmarked Forms” (by Katrien Beuls) on Hungarian verbal
agreement models a phenomenon whereby morphosyntactic, semantic, and phono-
logical factors affect the choice between poly- and mono-personal agreement—that is,
the decision whether a Hungarian transitive verb should agree with its object or just
with its subject. The case and definiteness of the object and the person hierarchy rela-
tionship between subject and object determine which kind of agreement obtains, and
phonological constraints determine its form. To make the different levels of structure
interact properly, constructions are grouped into sets (lexical, morphological, etc.) and
those sets are considered in a fixed order during processing. Construction sets also allow
for efficient handling of unmarked forms (null affixes)—they are considered only after
the overt affixes have had the opportunity to apply, thereby functioning as defaults.
“Syntactic Indeterminacy and Semantic Ambiguity” (by Michael Spranger and
Martin Loetzsch) on German spatial phrases models the German spatial terms for front,
back, left, and right. To model spatial language in situated interaction with robots, two
problems must be overcome. The first is syntactic indeterminacy: Any of these spatial
relations may be realized as an adjective, an adverb, or a preposition. The second is
semantic ambiguity, specifically when the perspective (e.g., whose ‘left’?) is implicit.
Both are forms of underspecification which could cause early splits in the search space
if handled naively. Much in the spirit of the argument structure constructions (see
above), the solutions (which are too technical to explain here) involve (a) disjunctive
representations of potential values of a feature, and (b) deferring decisions until a more
opportune stage.
Part V: Robustness and Fluidity (by Steels and van Trijp) surveys the different
features of the system that ensure robustness in the face of variation, disfluencies,
and noise. Natural language is fluid and open-ended. There is variation between
speakers, there are disfluencies and speech errors, and noise may corrupt the speech
signal. All of these may jeopardize the interpretability of the signal, but human
listeners are adept at processing such input. In the spirit of usage-based grammar
(Tomasello 2003), FCG emphasizes the attainment of a communicative goal, rather than
ensuring grammaticality of parsed/produced utterances. This is accomplished with
a diagnostic-repair process that runs in parallel to parsing/production. Diagnostics
can test for unknown words, unfamiliar meanings, missing constructions, and so on.
Diagnostic tests are implemented by reversing the direction of the transduction process:
a speaker may assume the hearer’s point of view to analyze what she has produced

in order to see whether communicative success has been attained. Likewise, a hearer
may produce a phrase according to his own interpretation of the speaker’s form, and
check for a match. If a test fails, repair strategies such as proposing new constructions,
relaxing the matching process for construction application, and coercing constructions
to adapt to novel language use are considered.
Fluidity and robustness are the hallmarks of FCG, and the computational
framework has been used in experiments that assume embedded communication in
robotic agents. This research program is developed at length by Steels (2012b).
Discussion. Like the legacy of the GPSG book (Gazdar et al. 1985), this book’s main merit
is not necessarily in its technical details or computational choices, but in demonstrating
the feasibility of implementing the constructional approach in a full-fledged computa-
tional framework. We suggest that the CxG perspective presents a formidable challenge
to the computational linguistics/natural language processing community. It posits a
different notion of modularity than is observed by most NLP systems: Rather than
treat different levels of linguistic structure independently, CxG recognizes that multiple
formal components (phonological, lexical, morphological, syntactic) may be tied by
convention to a specific meaning or function. Systematically describing these “cross-
cutting” constructions and their processing, especially in a way that scales to large data
encompassing both form and meaning and accommodates both parsing and generation,
would in our view make for a more comprehensive account of language processing than
our field is able to offer today. Thus, we hope this book will be provocative even outside
of the grammar engineering community.
This book is not without its weaknesses. In parts the writing is quite technical and
terse, which can be daunting for readers new to FCG. Contextualization with respect to
other strands of computational linguistics and AI research is, for the most part, lacking,
though a second FCG book (Steels 2012a) picks up some of the slack on this front.4
DPFCG does not address the feasibility of learning constructions directly from data,5 nor
does it discuss the expressive power of the formalism in relation to learnability results
(such as that of Gold [1967]). As admitted by the authors, much more work would be
needed to build life-size grammars. Still, we hope that readers of DPFCG will appreciate
the authors’ vision for a model of linguistic form and function that is at once formal,
computational, fluid, and robust.

4 In particular, the Embodied Construction Grammar formalism noted earlier offers a similar
computational framework, though it reflects different research goals. The most important difference is
that FCG was designed to study language evolution, and ECG to study language acquisition and use
from a cognitive perspective. FCG is largely about processing (support for production as well as parsing
is considered essential); ECG places a greater premium on the meaning representation, formalizing a
number of theoretical constructs from cognitive semantics. Chang, De Beule, and Micelli (2012) compare
and contrast the two approaches in detail.

Fluidity and robustness are the hallmarks of FCG, and the computational framework has been used in experiments that assume embedded communication in robotic agents.

Like the legacy of the GPSG book (Gazdar et al. 1985), this book’s main merit is not necessarily in its technical details or computational choices, but in demonstrating the feasibility of implementing the constructional approach in a full-fledged computational framework. We suggest that the CxG perspective presents a formidable challenge to the computational linguistics/natural language processing community. It posits a different notion of modularity than is observed by most NLP systems: Rather than treat different levels of linguistic structure independently, CxG recognizes that multiple formal components (phonological, lexical, morphological, </context>

Each argument structure construction imposes a partial mapping between the syntactic and semantic arguments to yield a particular argument structure instantiation, one of the multiple alternatives that may be available for a single lexical item. This account stands in sharp contrast to the lexicalist view of argument-structure (the view taken in LFG, HPSG, and CCG) whereby each lexical entry dictates all the necessary linking information. The construction-based approach is defended for its ability to deal with unknown words2 and constructional coercion3 (Goldberg 1995). The argument structure design pattern allows FCG to crudely recover a partial specification of the form-meaning mapping of these elements, which is important for robust processing (see subsequent discussion). Part III: Managing Processing addresses how FCG transduces between a linguistic string and a meaning representation, where the two directions (parsing and production) share a common declarative representation of linguistic knowledge (the grammar). This entails assembling an analysis incrementally on the basis of the grammar, the input, and any partial analysis that has already been crea</context>

Skeletal constructions compose with smaller units to form hierarchical structures (essentially similar to the Immediate Constituents Analysis of Bloomfield [1933] and follow-up work in structuralist linguistics [Harris 1946]), and a range of additional constructions impose form (e.g., ordering) constraints and add new meaning to the newly created phrases.

Part V: Robustness and Fluidity (by Steels and van Trijp) surveys the different features of the system that ensure robustness in the face of variation, disfluencies, and noise. Natural language is fluid and open-ended. There is variation between speakers, there are disfluencies and speech errors, and noise may corrupt the speech signal. All of these may jeopardize the interpretability of the signal, but human listeners are adept at processing such input. In the spirit of usage-based grammar (Tomasello 2003), FCG emphasizes the attainment of a communicative goal, rather than ensuring grammaticality of parsed/produced utterances. This is accomplished with a diagnostic-repair process that runs in parallel to parsing/production. Diagnostics can test for unknown words, unfamiliar meanings, missing constructions, and so on. Diagnostic tests are implemented by reversing the direction of the transduction process: a speaker may assume the hearer’s point of view to analyze what she has produced 450 Book Review in order to see whether communicative success has been attained. Likewise, a hearer may produce </context>
