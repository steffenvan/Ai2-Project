Vol. 4, No. 2 (Summer 1990) of the International Journal of
Supercomputer Applications is devoted to a collection of articles
that demonstrates the benefits of using visualization as an essential
approach for interpreting and evaluating computational results.
Guest edited by Steve Follin, this exciting issue is accompanied by
an hour-long videotape available in VHS format, with segments
elucidating each of the featured articles. Vol. 4, No. 2 covers problems
ranging from the simulation of global climatic effects of greenhouse
gases and the evolution of a numerically severe storm to the photomet-
ric classification of clouds on Jupiter and the numerical simulation of
flow through an artificial heart valve.
Order today and see for yourself how visualization is enabling
researchers to represent the scientific challenges that supercomputers
are addressing.

ECS NATURAL LANGUAGE TOOLKITS
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.988672155555555">
The Toolkits provide a set of powerful and flexible tools for the development of natural
language systems. Based on Lexical- Functional Grammar, the high-level linguistic
formalism can easily be mastered by linguists with no programming experience. The
Toolkits contain all the essential elements in the development of natural language
processing and machine translation systems, including analysis and translation
engines and tools to create lexicons and grammars. Various Toolkits combine
modules for specific applications.
Text Analysis The Pcusel module, a table-driven chart parser, builds c-structures and f-structures,
using both top-down and head-centered rules and a unique unification technique that preserves both
space and time. The linguist can monitor parsing, watching edges, trees and dags as they are built,
with easy access to rules and lexical entries. Ambiguities can be resolved either by user interaction
or automatically.
Translation The
Transel module has
all of the power and
flexibility of Parse!,
but also adds
transfer and genera-
tion of target lan-
guage text. The clic-
tionary includes transfer
entries that define con-
ditions under which
words and construc-
tions of a source lan-
guage are mapped to
various possible trans-
lations in a target language.
Morphology Morsel is a program which automatically generates the morphology rules based on
textbook-style inflectional paradigms. The linguist can also specify allomorphic variation, morpheme
class adjacency, and morphemic features.
Lexicons The Dictionary Maintenance Utility is a user-friendly tool for adding and updating lexical
entries. Using menus, examples, and on-line helps, the user can easily flag morphological, syntactic,
and semantic information, including mapping information for translation. An extremely flexible utility
can be used to alter the choices presented to the end-user, modifying menus, the size and location of
the various windows, headings, labels, values, questions, and selections that appear in DMU. Other
utilities allow definition of grammar symbols, rules, and standard inheritance entries, as well as op-
timization operations on the dictionary file system.
Semantic Preference The Sementry Utility provides for the creation of semantic preference nets for
the resolution of lexical ambiguity.
Lingware The ECS English Grammar and Lexicon consist of a mature set of English analysis rules
with 15,000 fully flagged English words. Other languages are forthcoming.

<bodyText confidence="0.824807105263158">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in computational
linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The length of a paper
depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is
the equivalent of twelve journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of
the editorial board and usually by an additional expert in the particular subject matter.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the manuscript is not
copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to another refereed journal. If any
version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-refereed publication, the details of such
publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper
tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by
all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary
under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary results
of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Technical
correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is
reviewed by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

<abstract confidence="0.963672065217391">ECS NATURAL LANGUAGE TOOLKITS The Toolkits provide a set of powerful and flexible tools for the development of natural language systems. Based on Lexical- Functional Grammar, the high-level linguistic formalism can easily be mastered by linguists with no programming experience. The Toolkits contain all the essential elements in the development of natural language processing and machine translation systems, including analysis and translation engines and tools to create lexicons and grammars. Various Toolkits combine modules for specific applications. Analysis a table-driven chart parser, builds c-structures and f-structures, using both top-down and head-centered rules and a unique unification technique that preserves both space and time. The linguist can monitor parsing, watching edges, trees and dags as they are built, with easy access to rules and lexical entries. Ambiguities can be resolved either by user interaction or automatically. has all of the power and flexibility of Parse!, but also adds transfer and generation of target lantext. The clictionary includes transfer entries that define conditions under which words and constructions of a source language are mapped to various possible translations in a target language. a program which automatically generates the morphology rules based on textbook-style inflectional paradigms. The linguist can also specify allomorphic variation, morpheme class adjacency, and morphemic features. Maintenance Utility is user-friendly tool for adding and updating lexical entries. Using menus, examples, and on-line helps, the user can easily flag morphological, syntactic, and semantic information, including mapping information for translation. An extremely flexible utility can be used to alter the choices presented to the end-user, modifying menus, the size and location of various windows, headings, labels, values, questions, and selections that appear in utilities allow definition of grammar symbols, rules, and standard inheritance entries, as well as optimization operations on the dictionary file system. Preference Utility for the creation of semantic preference nets for the resolution of lexical ambiguity. English Grammar and Lexicon of a mature set of English analysis rules with 15,000 fully flagged English words. Other languages are forthcoming.
