Linguistics and Philosophyfocuses on issues related to structure and meaning
in natural language, as addressed in the philosophy of language, linguistic
semantics, syntax and related disciplines, in particular the following areas:
- philosophical theories of meaning and truth, reference, description,
entailment, presupposition, implicatures, context-dependence, and
speech acts;
- linguistic theories of semantic interpretation in relation to syntactic
structure and prosody, of discourse structure, lexcial semantics and
semantic change;
- psycholinguistic theories of semantic interpretation and issues of the
processing and acquisition of natural language, and the relation of
semantic interpretation to other cognitive faculties;
- mathematical and logical properties of natural language and general
aspects of computational linguistics;
- philosophical questions raised by linguistics as a science: linguistics
methodology, properties of linguistic theories and frameworks, and the
relation of linguistics to other fields of inquiry.

MIT CogNetTM (http://cognet.mit.edu) is an electronic
community for the cognitive and brain sciences. It brings
together current and classic resources in the field and
provides a unique, interactive forum for scholars, stu-
dents, and professionals. Currently under development,
MIT CogNet is a free service through August 31, 2000,
and welcomes charter members during this period.
Services of MIT CogNetTM include a searchable, full-text
library with a growing collection of books, journals, and
reference works; an academic almanac of cognitive
science programs; HotScience editorials by invited
scientists on groundbreaking or controversial aspects of
their research; job listings; CV and bibliography utilities;
virtual poster sessions; threaded discussion groups;
a seminar manager with information about current
seminars and lecture series at participating academic
institutions; community member profiles; and more.
MIT CogNetTM offers the latest research, reference, and

Markup Languages: Theory and Practice is a quarterly, peer-re-
viewed technical journal devoted to research, development, and practi-
cal applications of text markup for computer processing, management,
manipulation, and display. Specific areas of interest include new syn-
taxes for generic markup languages; refinements to existing markup
languages; theory of formal languages as applied to document markup;
systems for mark-up; uses of markup for printing, hypertext, electronic
display, content analysis, information reuse and repurposing, search and
retrieval, and interchange; shared applications of markup languages; and
techniques and methodologies for developing markup languages and
applications of markup languages.

While respecting its historical link with the field of MT, Machine Translation is
changing and broadening its scope of interest to encompass all branches of
Computational Linguistics and Language Engineering, whereverthey incorporate
a MULTILINGUAL aspect. We therefore welcome submissions to the journal on
THEORETICAL, DESCRIPTIVE OR COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS of any of the
following topics:
+ machine translation and machine-aided translation + human translation
theory and practise + multilingual text composition and generation
+ multilingual information retrieval + multilingual natural language interfaces
+ multilingual dialogue systems + multilingual message understanding systems
+corpus-based and statistical language modelling +connectionist approaches
to translation + compilation and use of bi- and multilingual corpora + discourse
phenomena and their treatment in (human or machine) translation
+ knowledge engineering + contrastive linguistics + morphology, syntax,
semantics, pragmatics + computer-aided language instruction and learning
+ software localization and internationalization + speech processing, especially
for speech translation + phonetics, phonology + computational implications of
non-Roman character sets + multilingual word-processing + the multilingual
information society (sociological and legal as well as linguistic aspects)
+ minority languages + history of machine translation. We would also welcome
your suggestions about other features you would like to see in this journal, for
example, special issues, squibs, topical comment.

Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are paid.
Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored
conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Payments for membership dues, fund donations, back issues, and
proceedings may be made in Europe or the USA. IMPORTANT NOTE: Renewals must be received no later than I April
2000 to avoid late payment fee assessment. Membership categories include Regular Members and the following: Couples
with the same mailing address may be Joint Members; they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible
for all other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may become
Student Members WITH COPY OF CURRENT STUDENT ID. Students who are not Student Members because of their
income can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Also available are Retired and Unemployed
memberships. We now offer MULTI-YEAR MEMBERSHIPS to Regular and Joint members. If no indication is provided
of multi-year membership preference, one-year membership will be presumed for Regular and Joint. Late payment fee does
not apply to new memberships.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.320475">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and,refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.883231">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962836888888889">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to
forty double-spaced pages.- That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electroni-
cally; consult hap: / /www.aclweb.orgiclisubmit.txt for instructions and pointers to the LATEX
style files. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies
the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to
another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non-
refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing
Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed;
others are likely to be added.

<abstract confidence="0.935414444444445">Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.</abstract>
