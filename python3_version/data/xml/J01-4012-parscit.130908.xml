That the terms &amp;quot;dialogue&amp;quot; (e.g., between hu-
mans) and &amp;quot;interaction&amp;quot; (e.g., between user
and computer) can be used interchangeably
is implicitly assumed throughout this collec-
tion of papers edited by Taylor, Neel, and
Bouwhuis. That a dialogue typically involves
the use of multiple &amp;quot;modes&amp;quot; of communica-
tion and that it has its own internal struc-
ture are of obvious import to those who work
in application domains that require the col-
laboration of human users either with soft-
ware systems or with one another through
the use of mediating software systems. This
collection, therefore, will be of interest to re-
searchers who want to know about early at-
tempts to apply the metaphor of multimodal
human-human communication to collabora-
tive domains such as these.
This volume is a long-delayed follow-up
publication from a workshop held under the
same title in Aquafredda di Maratea, Italy, in
1991.1 The material in this volume is clearly
not recent—the editors report that the au-
thors were requested to bring the papers up
to date, but since practically all of the works
referenced by the papers in this volume pre-
date 1994, it seems that their request was not
made in the years prior to publication. This is
also reflected in the absence of the notion of
a communicative agent (although, due to its
now-rampant overuse, some might welcome
this) and the lack of reference to the work
on embodied agents that emerged in the last
decade and is clearly relevant (for exam-

ple, Cassell et al. [1994] and much research
since then). However, the publication of this
volume does make previously difficult-to-
find material more readily available and does
provide an interesting historical context for
contemporary research.
The application of the metaphor of human-
human communication to human-computer
interaction is hardly new—descriptions and
discussions predate the 1980s (e.g., Nick-
erson 1977)—but it does invoke a cer-
tain amount of theoretical baggage. Those
papers in this volume that contain dis-
cussions that address (however obliquely)
such issues are perhaps of more enduring
interest than those that describe implemen-
tations. Of particular interest are attempts
to define the notions of a mode, a modal-
ity, and a medium of communication—such
as those by Maybury and Lee, Teil and
Beluk, and Taylor and Waugh. Such terms
are used to distinguish among &amp;quot;manners&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;ways&amp;quot; of communicating, and part of
the difficulty in defining them (evidenced
in this volume by a lack of consensus) is
that their meanings are indexical—their def-
initions depend upon an underlying theory
(or at least model) of communication. One
such underlying theory of choice in this vol-
ume is Layered Protocol Theory, which is dis-
tinctly information-theoretic in flavor (unfor-
tunately, the description of this theory does
not appear until chapter 25 of the 28 chap-
ters). Another possible underlying theory,
which is not explicitly adopted here, is pro-
posed by Allwood in the introductory mate-
rial (and is described in more detail in All-
wood [1995]). Speech Act Theory receives
scant attention.
Only a subset of the papers take on the
topic of dialogue structure that is suggested
by the title The Structure of Multimodal Dia-
logue II. Moreover, the editors&apos; caveat that
the collection is intended to inspire the in-
teraction of cross-disciplinary ideas cannot
excuse the poor quality of certain papers.
This volume is certainly not a must-have,
but some readers might find certain papers
a complement to an existing collection of re-
search literature concerned with the use of
multiple modes of communication in collabo-
rative domains.—Melanie A. Baljko, University

&amp;quot;Comprehensive in scope, this up-to-date
handbook thoroughly explores the design
and application of natural language text-
based processing systems based on gener-
ative linguistics, empirical corpus analysis,
and artificial neural networks—emphasizing
the design and implementation of the lan-
guage input/output components of compu-
tational systems for increased fluency and
flexibility.
&amp;quot;Adopting a historically based structure to
the approaches of NLP, each self-contained
section of the [book] provides an introduc-
tory overview of the approach discussed, de-
tails of fundamental concepts and procedures
appropriate to the approach, and specific ap-
plications in which the approach has been
used successfully.&amp;quot;—From the publisher&apos;s an-

&amp;quot;There are not many scientific fields as in-
terdisciplinary as formal language theory. In
this volume, it is presented as the very inter-
section point of Mathematics, Computer Sci-
ence, Linguistics, and Biology. This book is a
collection of papers which closely examines
classical topics in computer science inspired
by formal languages, as well as showing new
concepts and problems motivated in linguis-
tics and biology. The papers are organized
into four sections: Grammars and Grammar
Systems, Automata, Languages and Combi-
natorics, and Models of Molecular Comput-
ing. They clearly prove the power, wealth,
and vitality of the theory nowadays and
sketch some trends for its future develop-
ment. The volume is intended for an audi-
ence of computer scientists, computational
linguists, theoretical biologists, and any other
people interested in dealing with the prob-
lems and challenges of interdisciplinarity.&amp;quot;—
From the publisher&apos;s announcement, with minor
corrections
&amp;quot;Our volume has two goals. One is to
present some recent results in active areas of
the three domains that converge in the new
field. The other one is to celebrate the 50th
birthday of Gheorghe Faun, who, from for-
mal language theory, promoted the new re-
search area and made seminal contributions
to it.... All the papers are contributed by
Gheorghe Pun&apos;s collaborators, colleagues,
friends, and students in the five continents,
who wanted to show in this way their recog-
nition to him for his tremendous work. We
have collected 38 papers by 75 authors here.
(Another set of 38 papers by 65 authors will
be published soon in the future.)&amp;quot;—From the

tem. The research described here involves
the representation of technical computer con-
cepts, but also the representation of how
users conceptualize such concepts. These sys-
tems range from menu-based to natural lan-
guage interfaces, some providing active help,
intervening when they believe the user to
have misconceptions, and some based on
empirical studies of what users actually do
while using UNIX. Further papers investi-
gate planning and knowledge representation
where the focus is on discovering what the
user wants to do, and figuring out a way to
do it as well as representing the knowledge
needed to do so. There is a focus on natural
language dialogue where consultation sys-
tems can become active, incorporating user
modeling, natural language generation, and
plan recognition, modeling metaphors and
users&apos; mistaken beliefs.
The articles are derived from papers
originally presented at a workshop en-
titled &amp;quot;Knowledge Representation in the
UNIX Help Domain,&amp;quot; organized by Pe-
ter Norvig, Wolfgang Wahlster, and Ro-
bert Wilertsky at the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley, USA, in December 1987. The
area of intelligent help systems for UNIX pro-
vides such a fruitful example domain of ap-
plication for many Al techniques that this
work is still timely, more widely and par-
ticularly now where we have many spoken
dialogue systems applied to such fixed do-
mains. Each article here has been reviewed
by the editors and has been subsequently
revised; furthermore, all authors have been
asked to include a section on recent de-
velopments in their work.—Adapted from

<abstract confidence="0.989936769230769">amp;quot;There are not many scientific fields as interdisciplinary as formal language theory. In this volume, it is presented as the very intersection point of Mathematics, Computer Science, Linguistics, and Biology. This book is a collection of papers which closely examines classical topics in computer science inspired by formal languages, as well as showing new concepts and problems motivated in linguistics and biology. The papers are organized into four sections: Grammars and Grammar Systems, Automata, Languages and Combinatorics, and Models of Molecular Computing. They clearly prove the power, wealth, and vitality of the theory nowadays and sketch some trends for its future development. The volume is intended for an audience of computer scientists, computational linguists, theoretical biologists, and any other people interested in dealing with the problems and challenges of interdisciplinarity.&amp;quot;— From the publisher&apos;s announcement, with minor corrections &amp;quot;Our volume has two goals. One is to present some recent results in active areas of the three domains that converge in the new field. The other one is to celebrate the 50th birthday of Gheorghe Faun, who, from formal language theory, promoted the new research area and made seminal contributions to it.... All the papers are contributed by Gheorghe Pun&apos;s collaborators, colleagues, friends, and students in the five continents, who wanted to show in this way their recognition to him for his tremendous work. We have collected 38 papers by 75 authors here. (Another set of 38 papers by 65 authors will published soon in the future.)&amp;quot;—From editors&apos; preface</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.983967377777778">This collection of papers concerns artificialintelligence (Al) and cognitive-science techniques applied to the problem of providing systems for the UNIX operating sys- 603 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 tem. The research described here involves the representation of technical computer concepts, but also the representation of how users conceptualize such concepts. These systems range from menu-based to natural language interfaces, some providing active help, intervening when they believe the user to have misconceptions, and some based on empirical studies of what users actually do while using UNIX. Further papers investigate planning and knowledge representation where the focus is on discovering what the user wants to do, and figuring out a way to do it as well as representing the knowledge needed to do so. There is a focus on natural language dialogue where consultation systems can become active, incorporating user modeling, natural language generation, and plan recognition, modeling metaphors and users&apos; mistaken beliefs. The articles are derived from papers originally presented at a workshop entitled &amp;quot;Knowledge Representation in the UNIX Help Domain,&amp;quot; organized by Peter Norvig, Wolfgang Wahlster, and Robert Wilertsky at the University of California, Berkeley, USA, in December 1987. The area of intelligent help systems for UNIX provides such a fruitful example domain of application for many Al techniques that this work is still timely, more widely and particularly now where we have many spoken dialogue systems applied to such fixed domains. Each article here has been reviewed by the editors and has been subsequently revised; furthermore, all authors have been asked to include a section on recent dein their from the publisher&apos;s announcement and the editors&apos;</abstract>

[1994] and much research since then). However, the publication of this volume does make previously difficult-tofind material more readily available and does provide an interesting historical context for contemporary research. The application of the metaphor of humanhuman communication to human-computer interaction is hardly new—descriptions and discussions predate the 1980s (e.g., Nickerson 1977)—but it does invoke a certain amount of theoretical baggage. Those papers in this volume that contain discussions that address (however obliquely) such issues are perhaps of more enduring interest than those that describe implementations. Of particular interest are attempts to define the notions of a mode, a modality, and a medium of communication—such as those by Maybury and Lee, Teil and Beluk, and Taylor and Waugh. Such terms are used to distinguish among &amp;quot;manners&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ways&amp;quot; of communicating, and part of the difficulty in defining them (evidenced in this volume by a lack of consensus) is th</context>
