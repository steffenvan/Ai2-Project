When (computational) linguists speak of &amp;quot;lexical semantics,&amp;quot; quite often they are actu-
ally referring to the more narrow area of verb semantics. Similarly, this book chooses
the fairly abstract title &amp;quot;predicative forms&amp;quot; to join 12 contributions, most of which
are concerned with verbs, their meaning, and the relationships between meaning
and syntax. The book is the follow-up publication of a workshop held under the
same title in Toulouse in August 1996. Taken together, the collection provides a good
overview of contemporary approaches to lexical (verb) semantics, and thanks to a
50-page introductory chapter written by the editor, it is also useful reading for grad-
uate students who are considering immersing themselves in lexico-semantic issues.
This introduction offers brief explanations of some central themes and theories that
are referred to in the later chapters (argument structure, thematic roles, lexical rela-
tions, polysemy, verb alternations and corresponding verb classes, WordNet, lexical-
conceptual structure, and the generative lexicon), always with references to further
reading.
The additional introductory chapter is one of three elements that distinguish the
book from plain workshop proceedings. The second element is an index, but it is
unfortunately a rather sparse one. The third add-on is a chapter that summarizes the
contributions to a panel session held at the workshop—see the end of this review. In
contrast to these bonuses, one mildly annoying feature of many workshop proceedings
can be found in this book too: Some parts of it display an unfortunate abundance of
typographical and other errors.
Let us begin our glance at the individual papers with the two that are mainly
concerned with words other than verbs. One is by Federica Busa, who works in the
framework of the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995) and proposes a classification
of agentive nominals along with representations that can explain some interesting
aspects of their syntactic behavior. The other study deals with connectives: Jacques
Jayez and Corinne Rossari use generalized quantifier theory to offer a classification of
some connectives that involve inferences in recognizing the relation holding between
the conjuncts.
The most application-oriented chapter is by Evelyne Viegas et al. The authors
first describe the architecture of the Mikrokosmos parser and the format of the lexical
representations used therein, and then discuss the practical issues of semiautomatically

acquiring the knowledge resources for such a large system, focusing in particular on
how to balance the information between language-neutral ontology and language-
specific lexicons.
Among the papers devoted to verbs, three are centered on the notion of argument
structure. The most &amp;quot;theoretical&amp;quot; paper of the book is by Charles Jones, who exam-
ines the borderline between morphology and syntax in the Government-and-Binding
framework, and argues that the rules operating in the two realms are of different
kinds. Approaching the subject from an applied perspective, Dimitrios Kokkinakis is
interested in automatically acquiring the argument structure of Swedish verbs from
large corpora. He starts with a handbuilt valency database and then uses a tagger, lem-
matizer, and chunk parser to validate this information in the corpus. Working with a
comprehensive set of French verbs, Patrick Saint-Dizier builds a catalogue of 200 pos-
sible verbal &amp;quot;contexts&amp;quot; (generalized argument structures) and then forms verb classes
according to which configurations a verb can appear in. The resulting 953 classes reflect
the alternation behavior of verbs and are thus similar in nature to those proposed by
Levin (1993). But Saint-Dizier points out the difference that Levin&apos;s classes are primar-
ily based on shared semantic features, and thus exceptions in the alternation behavior
within a class are allowed; his own classification is, by contrast, solely motivated by
shared syntactic behavior. Accordingly, he arrives at a large number of classes, most
of which are very small.
From a different perspective, Levin&apos;s verb classes are compared to the classes of
WordNet (Miller and Fellbaum 1991) in the paper by Christiane Fellbaum, who first
describes the treatment of verbs in WordNet and then argues that the alternation
behavior of verbs is in part reflected by the WordNet classification, as some nonter-
minal WordNet classes roughly correlate with some alternations. This is remarkable,
because according to Fellbaum the WordNet classes were meant as purely semantic;
syntax did not play a role in setting them up. While Saint-Dizier in his work on alter-
nations deliberately avoids semantic issues, Palmer et al. present a detailed study of
the meaning of verbs involving motion and paths, as well as some of their alternations.
By adding appropriate semantic features to a grammar in the formalism of feature-
based LTAGs, the authors argue that their representations can be used in transfer-based
MT to handle certain divergences that are commonly seen to favor using interlingual
systems.
Similar to Palmer et al., Maria Angeles Zarco uses lexical-conceptual structure
(LCS) (Jackendoff 1990) to represent the meaning of verbs. Here, LCS serves as an
interlingua for Spanish, Italian, and English support-verb constructions and their cor-
responding lexicalized forms. And LCS is also the semantic framework of choice for
Achim Stein, who analyses polysemy in Italian verbs and suggests a type hierarchy
along with LCS-based representations. The idea is to shift the polysemy to the level
of the LCS primitives, which can thus assume multiple readings.
As this overview shows, the range of topics and theoretical frameworks underlying
the various chapters of the book is quite broad. Only a subset of the papers have
clear interconnections or provide some interestingly opposing views of a common
theme—which is the syntax-semantics interface of verbs. The book covers the major
current (especially computationally inspired) approaches to this topic, and this survey
function I would consider its main strength. One chapter in particular is devoted to
contrasting divergent conceptions: Summarizing their contributions to a panel session
held at the workshop, five authors (Busa, Dubois, Fellbaum, Saint-Dizier, and Viegas)
present their respective views on representing the transfer verbs buy and sell, often with
comments on the other contributions, which serves to partially re-create the flavor of
a panel.
