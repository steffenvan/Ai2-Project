We adopt the lexically grounded approach of
the Penn Discourse Treebank, and describe
our classification of Hindi discourse connec-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999595">
To enable NLP research and applications beyond
the sentence-level, corpora annotated with dis-
course level information have been developed.
The recently developed Penn Discourse Tree-
bank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), for example,
provides annotations of discourse relations (e.g.,
causal, contrastive, temporal, and elaboration
relations) in the Penn Treebank Corpus. Recent
interest in cross-linguistic studies of discourse
relations has led to the initiation of similar dis-
course annotation projects in other languages as
well, such as Chinese (Xue, 2005), Czech (Mla-
dová et al., 2008), and Turkish (Deniz and Web-
ber, 2008). In this paper, we describe our ongo-
ing work on the creation of a Hindi Discourse
Relation Bank (HDRB), broadly following the
approach of the PDTB.1 The size of the HDRB
corpus is 200K words and it is drawn from a
400K word corpus on which Hindi syntactic de-
pendency annotation is being independently con-
ducted (Begum et al., 2008). Source corpus texts
are taken from the Hindi newspaper Amar Ujala,
and comprise news articles from several do-
mains, such as politics, sports, films, etc. We

2 Discourse Relations and Arguments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999821913043478">
Following the PDTB approach, we take dis-
course relations to be realized in one of three
ways: (a) as explicit connectives, which are
“closed class” expressions drawn from well-
defined grammatical classes; (b) as alternative
lexicalizations (AltLex), which are non-
connective expressions that cannot be defined as
explicit connectives; and (c) as implicit connec-
tives, which are implicit discourse relations “in-
ferred” between adjacent sentences not related by
an explicit connective. When no discourse rela-
tion can be inferred between adjacent sentences,
either an entity-based coherence relation (called
EntRel) or the absence of a relation (called No-
Rel) is marked between the sentences. The two
abstract object relata of a discourse relation are
called the relation‟s arguments (named Arg1 and
Arg2), and argument annotation follows the “mi-
nimality principle” in that only as much is se-
lected as the argument text span as is minimally
necessary to interpret the relation. Finally, each
discourse relation is assigned a sense label based
on a hierarchical sense classification.

2.1 Explicit Connectives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998742">
In addition to the three major grammatical
classes of Explicit connectives in the PDTB –
subordinating conjunctions, coordinating con-
junctions, and adverbials – we recognize three
other classes, described below.
Sentential Relatives: These are relative pro-
nouns that conjoin a relative clause with its ma-
trix clause. As the name suggests, only relatives
that modify verb phrases are treated as discourse
connectives, and not those that modify noun
phrases. Some examples are जिससे (so that),
जिसके कारण (because of which).

<bodyText confidence="0.897213666666667">
“[Dropping all his work, he picked up the bird
and ran towards the dispensary], so that {it

Subordinators: These include postpositions (Ex.
2), verbal participles, and suffixes that introduce
non-finite clauses with an abstract object inter-
pretation.2
[बा की बातें सुन]कर {मन-ही-मन गाांधीिी बहुत
ऱजजित हुए}।
“Upon [hearing Baa&apos;s words], {Gandhiji felt very
ashamed}.”
Particles: Particles such as भी, ना act as dis-
course connectives. भी is an emphatic inclusive
particle used to suggest the inclusion of verbs,
entities, adverbs, and adjectives. Instances of
such particles which indicate the inclusion of
verbs are taken as discourse connectives (Ex. 3)
while others are not.

2.2 Arguments of Discourse Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945532785714286">
In the PDTB, the assignment of the Arg1 and
Arg2 labels to a discourse relation&apos;s arguments is
syntactically driven, in that the Arg2 label is as-

signed to the argument with which the connec-
tive was syntactically associated, while the Arg1
label is assigned to the „other&apos; argument. In
HDRB, however, the Arg1/Arg2 label assign-
ment is semantically driven, in that it is based on
the “sense” of the relation to which the argu-
ments belong. Thus, each sense definition for a
relation specifies the sense-specific semantic role
of each of its arguments, and stipulates one of the
two roles to be Arg1, and the other, Arg2. For
example, the „cause&apos; sense definition, which in-
volves a causal relation between two eventuali-
ties, specifies that one of its arguments is the
cause, while the other is the effect, and further
stipulates that the cause will be assigned the label
Arg2, while the effect will be assigned the label
Arg1. Apart from giving meaning to the argu-
ment labels, our semantics-based convention has
the added advantage simplifying the sense classi-
fication scheme. This is discussed further in Sec-
tion 3.

2.3 Implicit Discourse Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998825">
The HDRB annotation of implicit discourse rela-
tions largely follows the PDTB scheme. The only
difference is that while implicit relations in
PDTB are annotated only between paragraph-
internal adjacent sentences, we also annotate
such relations across paragraph boundaries.

3 Senses of Discourse Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999806448275862">
Broadly, we follow the PDTB sense classifica-
tion in that we take it to be a hierarchical classi-
fication, with the four top level sense classes of
“Temporal”, “Contingency”, “Comparison”, and
“Expansion”. Further refinements to the top class
level are provided at the second type level and
the third subtype level. Here, we describe our
points of departure from the PDTB classification.
The changes are partly motivated by general
considerations for capturing additional senses,
and partly by language-specific considerations.
Figure 1 reflects the modifications we have made
to the sense scheme. These are described below.
Eliminating argument-specific labels: In the
PDTB sense hierarchy, the tags at the type level
are meant to express further refinements of the
relations&apos; semantics, while the tags at the subtype
level are meant to reflect different orderings of
the arguments (see Section 2.2). In HDRB, we
eliminate these argument-ordering labels from
the subtype level, since these labels don&apos;t direct-
ly pertain to the meaning of discourse relations.
All levels in the sense hierarchy thus have the
purpose of specifying the semantics of the rela-
tion to different degrees of granularity. The rela-
tive ordering of the arguments is instead speci-
fied in the definition of the type-level senses, and
is inherited by the more refined senses at the sub-
type level.

<bodyText confidence="0.99995">
The “Goal” sense: Under the “Contingency”
class, we have added a new type “Goal”, which
applies to relations where the situation described
in one of the arguments is the goal of the situa-
tion described in the other argument (which
enables the achievement of the goal).

4 Initial Annotation Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998376294117647">
Based on the guidelines as described in this pa-
per, we annotated both explicit and implicit rela-
tions in 35 texts (averaging approx. 250
words/text) from the HDRB corpus. A total of
602 relation tokens were annotated. Here we
present some useful distributions we were able to
derive from our initial annotation, and discuss
them in light of cross-linguistic comparisons of
discourse relations.
Types and Tokens of Discourse Relations: Ta-
ble 1 shows the overall distribution of the differ-
ent relation types, i.e., Explicit, AltLex, Implicit,
EntRel, and NoRel. The second column reports
the number of unique expressions used to realize
the relation – Explicit, Implicit and AltLex –

of tokens and relative frequencies.

<bodyText confidence="0.997982905660378">
Uniform treatment of pragmatic relations: As
in PDTB, discourse relations in HDRB are
pragmatic when their relations have to be in-
ferred from the propositional content of the ar-
guments. However, we replace the PDTB prag-
matic senses with a uniform three-way classifica-
tion. Each pragmatic sense at the type level is
further distinguished into three subtypes: “epis-
temic” (Sweetser 1990), “speech-act” (Sweetser
1990), and “propositional”. The propositional
subtype involves the inference of a complete
proposition. The relation is then taken to hold
between this inferred proposition and the propo-
sitional content of one of the arguments.
These distributions show some interesting simi-
larities and differences with the PDTB distribu-
tions (cf. Prasad et al., 2008). First, given that
Hindi has a much richer morphological paradigm
than English; one would have expected that it
would have fewer explicit connectives. That is,
one might expect Hindi to realize discourse rela-
tions morphologically more often than not, just
as it realizes other syntactic relations. However,
even in the small data set of 602 tokens that we
have annotated so far, we have found 49 unique
explicit connectives, which is roughly half the
number reported for the 1 million words anno-
tated in English texts in PDTB. It is expected that
we will find more unique types as we annotate
additional data. The relation type distribution
thus seems to suggest that the availability of
richer morphology in a language doesn&apos;t affect
connective usage. Second, the percentage of Alt-
Lex relations is higher in HDRB – 6.14% com-
pared to 1.5% in PDTB, suggesting that Hindi
makes greater usage of non-connective cohesive
links with the prior discourse. Further studies are
needed to characterize the forms and functions of
AltLex expressions in both English and Hindi.
Senses of Discourse Relations: We also ex-
amined the distributions for each sense class in
HDRB and computed the relative frequency of
the relations realized explicitly and implicitly.
Cross-linguistically, one would expect languages
to be similar in whether or not a relation with a
particular sense is realized explicitly or implicit-
ly, since this choice lies in the domain of seman-
tics and inference, rather than syntax. Thus, we
were interested in comparing the sense distribu-
tions in HDRB and PDTB. Table 2 shows these
distributions for the top class level senses. (Here
we counted the AltLex relations together with
explicit connectives.)

Contingency 57 (58.2%) 41 (41.8%)

<bodyText confidence="0.999868833333333">
The table shows that sense distributions in
HDRB are indeed similar to those reported in the
PDTB (cf. Prasad et al., 2008). That is, the
chances of “Expansion” and “Contingency” rela-
tions being explicit are lower compared to
“Comparison” and “Temporal” relations.

5 Summary and Future Work

This paper has reported on the Hindi Discourse
Relation Bank (HDRB) project, in which dis-
course relations, their arguments, and their
senses are being annotated. A major goal of our
work was to investigate how well the Penn Dis-
course Treebank (PDTB) and its guidelines could
be adapted for discourse annotation of Hindi
texts. To a large extent, we have successfully
adapted the PDTB scheme. Proposed changes
have to do with identification of some new syn-
tactic categories for explicit connectives, and
some general and language-driven modifications
to the sense classification. From our initial anno-
tations, we found that (a) there doesn&apos;t seem to
be an inverse correlation between the usage fre-
quency of explicit connectives and the morpho-
logical richness of a language, although there
does seem to be an increased use of cohesive
devices in such a language; and (b) sense distri-
butions confirm the lack of expectation of cross-
linguistic “semantic” differences. Our future goal
is to complete the discourse annotation of a 200K
word corpus, which will account for half of the
400K word corpus being also annotated for syn-
tactic dependencies. We also plan to extend the
annotation scheme to include attributions.

We adopt the lexically grounded approach of the Penn Discourse Treebank, and describe our classification of Hindi discourse connectives, our modifications to the sense classification of discourse relations, and some crosslinguistic comparisons based on some initial annotations carried out so far. 1 Introduction To enable NLP research and applications beyond the sentence-level, corpora annotated with discourse level information have been developed. The recently developed Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008), for example, provides annotations of discourse relations (e.g., causal, contrastive, temporal, and elaboration relations) in the Penn Treebank Corpus. Recent interest in cross-linguistic studies of discourse relations has led to the initiation of similar discourse annotation projects in other languages as well, such as Chinese (Xue, 2005), Czech (Mladová et al., 2008), and Turkish (Deniz and Webber, 2008). In this paper, we describe our ongoing work on the creation of a Hindi Discourse Relation Bank (HDRB), broadly following the approach of the PDTB.1 The size of the HDRB corpus is 200K word</context>

However, we replace the PDTB pragmatic senses with a uniform three-way classification. Each pragmatic sense at the type level is further distinguished into three subtypes: “epistemic” (Sweetser 1990), “speech-act” (Sweetser 1990), and “propositional”. The propositional subtype involves the inference of a complete proposition. The relation is then taken to hold between this inferred proposition and the propositional content of one of the arguments. These distributions show some interesting similarities and differences with the PDTB distributions (cf. Prasad et al., 2008). First, given that Hindi has a much richer morphological paradigm than English; one would have expected that it would have fewer explicit connectives. That is, one might expect Hindi to realize discourse relations morphologically more often than not, just as it realizes other syntactic relations. However, even in the small data set of 602 tokens that we have annotated so far, we have found 49 unique explicit connectives, which is roughly half the number reported for the 1 million words annotated in English texts in PDTB. It is expected that we will find more unique types as we annotate additi</context>

Thus, we were interested in comparing the sense distributions in HDRB and PDTB. Table 2 shows these distributions for the top class level senses. (Here we counted the AltLex relations together with explicit connectives.) Sense Class Explicit (%) Implicit (%) Contingency 57 (58.2%) 41 (41.8%) Comparison 68 (76.5%) 21 (23.5%) Temporal 43 (65.2%) 23 (34.8%) Expansion 64(40%) 94(60%) Table 2: Distribution of Class Level Senses The table shows that sense distributions in HDRB are indeed similar to those reported in the PDTB (cf. Prasad et al., 2008). That is, the chances of “Expansion” and “Contingency” relations being explicit are lower compared to “Comparison” and “Temporal” relations. 5 Summary and Future Work This paper has reported on the Hindi Discourse Relation Bank (HDRB) project, in which discourse relations, their arguments, and their senses are being annotated. A major goal of our work was to investigate how well the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) and its guidelines could be adapted for discourse annotation of Hindi texts. To a large extent, we have successfully adapted the PDTB scheme. Proposed changes have to do with identif</context>
