Graph theory is a well studied discipline, and so are the fields of natural language processing and in-
formation retrieval. However, most of the times, they are perceived as different disciplines, with different
algorithms, different applications, and different potential end-users.
The goal of this tutorial is to provide an overview of methods and applications in natural language
processing and information retrieval that rely on graph-based algorithms. This will include techniques for
graph traversal, minimum path length, min-cut algorithms, minimum spanning trees, random walks, etc. and
their application to information retrieval and Web search, text understanding (word sense disambiguation
and semantic classes), parsing, text summarization, keyword extraction, text clustering, and others.

Rada Mihalcea is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of North Texas. Her research
interests are in lexical semantics, graph-based algorithms for natural language processing and information
retrieval, minimally supervised natural language learning, and multilingual natural language processing.
She has published more than 80 articles in books, journals, and proceedings, in these and related areas. She
is the president of the ACL Special Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX), and a board member for the ACL
Special Group on Natural Language Learning (SIGNLL). She serves on the editorial board of the journal
of Computational Linguistics, the journal of Language Resources and Evaluations, and the recently estab-
lished journal of Interesting Negative Results in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Her
research is supported by NSF, Google, and the state of Texas.
Dragomir Radev is an Associate Professor of Information, of Computer Science and Engineering, and of
Linguistics at the University of Michigan. He has a PhD in Computer Science from Columbia University.
He has held numerous posts within NAACL and ACL. He is on the editorial boards of Information Retrieval
and the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research and was recently nominated to the board of the Journal
of Natural Language Engineering. He has co-chaired 5 ACL/NAACL workshops and given 6 tutorials at
venues like SIGIR, AAAI, and RANLP. Dragomir’s current interests are in text summarization, information
extraction, information retrieval, graph models, semi-supervised learning, and machine translation. He has
more than 50 peer-reviewed papers as well as more than 50 talks at various universities and other venues.
Dragomir’s work has been funded by NSF, NIH, and ONR.
