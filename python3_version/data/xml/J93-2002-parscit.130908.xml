Imagine a language that is completely unfamiliar; the only means of studying it are an ordinary
grammar book and a very large corpus of text. No dictionary is available. How can easily recog-
nized, surface grammatical facts be used to extract from a corpus as much syntactic information
as possible about individual words? This paper describes an approach based on two principles.
First, rely on local morpho-syntactic cues to structure rather than trying to parse entire sentences.
Second, treat these cues as probabilistic rather than absolute indicators of syntactic structure.
Apply inferential statistics to the data collected using the cues, rather than drawing a categorical
conclusion from a single occurrence of a cue. The effectiveness of this approach for inferring the
syntactic frames of verbs is supported by experiments on an English corpus using a program called
Lerner. Lerner starts out with no knowledge of content words—it bootstraps from determiners,
auxiliaries, modals, prepositions, pronouns, complementizers, coordinating conjunctions, and
punctuation.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9948236">
This paper presents a study in the automatic acquisition of lexical syntax from natu-
rally occurring English text. It focuses on discovering the kinds of syntactic phrases
that can be used to represent the semantic arguments of particular verbs. For example,
want can take an infinitive argument and hope a tensed clause argument, but not vice
versa:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99173075">
(1) a. John wants Mary to be happy.
b. John hopes that Mary is happy.
c. *John wants that Mary is happy.
d. *John hopes Mary to be happy.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897777777778">
This study focuses on the ability of verbs to take arguments represented by infinitives,
tensed clauses, and noun phrases serving as both direct and indirect objects. These
lexical properties are similar to those that Chomsky (1965) termed subcategorization
frames, but to avoid confusion the properties under study here will be referred to as
syntactic frames or simply frames.
The general framework for the problems addressed in this paper can be thought of
as follows. Imagine a language that is completely unfamiliar; the only means of study-
ing it are an ordinary grammar book and a very large corpus of text (or transcribed
speech). No dictionary is available. How can easily recognized, surface grammatical

facts be used to extract from a corpus as much syntactic information as possible about
individual words?
The scenario outlined above is adopted in this paper as a framework for basic
research in computational language acquisition. However, it is also an abstraction of
the situation faced by engineers building natural language processing (NLP) systems
for more familiar languages. The lexicon is a central component of NLP systems and
it is widely agreed that current lexical resources are inadequate. Language engineers
have access to some but not all of the grammar, and some but not all of the lexicon. The
most easily formalized and most reliable grammatical facts tend to be those involving
auxiliaries, modals, and determiners, the agreement and case properties of pronouns,
and so on. These vary little from speaker to speaker, topic to topic, register to register.
Unfortunately, this information is not sufficient to parse sentences completely, a fact
that is underscored by the current state of the parsing art. If sentences cannot be parsed
completely and reliably then the syntactic frames used in them cannot be determined
reliably. How, then, can reliable, easily formalized grammatical information be used
to extract syntactic facts about words from a corpus?
This paper suggests the following approach:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999849">
• Do not try to parse sentences completely. Instead, rely on local
morpho-syntactic cues such as the following facts about English: (1) The
word following a determiner is unlikely to be functioning as a verb;
(2) The sequence that the typically indicates the beginning of a clause.
• Do not try to draw categorical conclusions about a word on the basis of

<bodyText confidence="0.906002230769231">
one or a fixed number of examples. Instead, attempt to determine the
distribution of exceptions to the expected correspondence between cues
and syntactic frames. Use a statistical model to determine whether the
cooccurrence of a verb with cues for a frame is too regular to be
explained by randomly distributed exceptions.
The effectiveness of this approach for inferring the syntactic frames of verbs is sup-
ported by experiments using an implementation called Lerner. In the spirit of the prob-
lem stated above, Lerner starts out with no knowledge of content words—it bootstraps
from determiners, auxiliaries, modals, prepositions, pronouns, complementizers, co-
ordinating conjunctions, and punctuation. Lerner has two independent components
corresponding to the two strategies listed above. The first component identifies sen-
tences where a particular verb is likely to be exhibiting a particular syntactic frame.
It does this using local cues, such as the that the cue. This component keeps track of
the number of times each verb appears with cues for each syntactic frame as well as
the total number of times each verb occurs. This process can be described as collecting
observations and its output as an observations table. A segment of an actual observa-
tions table is shown in Table 4. The observations table serves as input to the statistical
modeler, which ultimately decides whether the accumulated evidence that a particular
verb manifests a particular syntactic frame in the input is reliable enough to warrant
a conclusion.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to design a system that
autonomously learns syntactic frames from naturally occurring text. The goal of learn-
ing syntactic frames and the learning framework described above lead to three major
differences between the approach reported here and most recent work in learning
grammar from text. First, this approach leverages a little a priori grammatical knowl-
edge using statistical inference. Most work on corpora of naturally occurring language

either uses no a priori grammatical knowledge (Brill and Marcus 1992; Ellison 1991;
Finch and Chater 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992), or else it relies on a large and com-
plex grammar (Hindle 1990, 1991). One exception is Magerman and Marcus (1991),
in which a small grammar is used to aid learning.&apos; A second difference is that the
work reported here uses inferential rather than descriptive statistics. In other words,
it uses statistical methods to infer facts about the language as it exists in the minds
of those who produced the corpus. Many other projects have used statistics in a way
that summarizes facts about the text but does not draw any explicit conclusions from
them (Finch and Chater 1992; Hindle 1990). On the other hand, Hindle (1991) does
use inferential statistics, and Brill (1992) recognizes the value of inference, although
he does not use inferential statistics per se. Finally, many other projects in machine
learning of natural language use input that is annotated in some way, either with
part-of-speech tags (Brill 1992; Brill and Marcus 1992; Magerman and Marcus 1990) or
with syntactic brackets (Pereira and Schabes 1992).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the morpho-
syntactic cues Lerner uses to collect observations. Section 3 presents the main contribu-
tion of this paper—the statistical model and experiments supporting its effectiveness.
Finally, Section 4 draws conclusions and lays out a research program in machine learn-
ing of natural language.

2. Collecting Observations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999916">
This section describes the local morpho-syntactic cues that Lerner uses to identify
likely examples of particular syntactic frames. These cues must address two problems:
finding verbs in the input and identifying phrases that represent arguments to the
verb. The next two subsections present cues for these tasks. The cues presented here
are not intended to be the last word on local cues to structure in English; they are
merely intended to illustrate the feasibility of such cues and demonstrate how the
statistical model accommodates their probabilistic correspondence to the true syntactic
structure of sentences. Variants of these cues are presented in Brent (1991a, 1991b). The
final subsection summarizes the procedure for collecting observations and discusses a
sample of the observations table collected from the Brown corpus.

2.1 Finding Verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999712">
Lerner identifies verbs in two stages, each carried out on a separate pass through the
corpus. First, strings that sometimes occur as verbs are identified. Second, occurrences
of those strings in context are judged as likely or unlikely to be verbal occurrences.
The second stage is necessary because of lexical ambiguity.
The first stage uses the fact that all English verbs can occur both with and without
the suffix -ing. Words are taken as potential verbs if and only if they display this
alternation in the corpus.2 There are a few words that meet this criterion but do not
occur as verbs, including income/incoming (*incame/incomed), ear/earring, her/herring,
and middle/middling. However, the second stage of verb detection, combined with the
statistical criteria, prevent these pairs from introducing errors.
</bodyText>

1 Brill and Marcus (1992) use a single grammatical rule in the test phase to supplement the rules their
system learns, but no grammatical knowledge is used in the learning phase.
2 Morphological analyzers typically use a root lexicon to resolve the ambiguities in morphological
adjustment rules (Karttunen 1983). The system described here uses rules similar to those of Karttunen
and Wittenburg (1983), but it resolves the ambiguities using only the contents of the corpus. This
technique will be described in a subsequent paper.

Lerner assumes that a potential verb is functioning as a verb unless the context
suggests otherwise. In particular, an occurrence of a potential verb is taken as a non-
verbal occurrence only if it follows a determiner or a preposition other than to. For
example, was talking would be taken as a verb, but a talk would not. This precaution
reduces the likelihood that a singular count noun will be mistaken for a verb, since
singular count nouns are frequently preceded by a determiner.
Finally, the only morphological forms that are used for learning syntactic frames
are the stem form and the -ing form. There are several reasons for this. First, forms
ending in -s are potentially ambiguous between third person singular present verbs
and plural nouns. Since plural nouns are not necessarily preceded by determiners
(I like to take walks), they could pose a significant ambiguity problem. Second, past
participles do not generally take direct objects: knows me and knew me are OK, but
not * is known me. Further, the past tense and past participle forms of some verbs are
identical, while those of others are distinct. As a result, using the -ed forms would
have complicated the statistical model substantially. Since the availability of raw text
is not generally a limiting factor, it makes sense to wait for the simpler cases.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999289">
2.2 Identifying Argument Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990002">
When a putative occurrence of a verb is found, the next step is to identify the syntactic
types of nearby phrases and determine whether or not they are likely to be arguments
of the verb.
First, assume that a phrase P and a verb V have been identified in some sentence.
Lerner &apos;s strategy for determining whether P is an argument to V has two components:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9965672">
1. If P is a noun phrase (NP), take it as an argument only if there is
evidence that it is not the subject of another clause.
2. Regardless of P&apos;s category, take it as an argument only if it occurs to the
right of V and there are no potential attachment points for P between V
and P.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998804777777778">
For example, suppose that the sequence that the were identified as the left boundary of
a clause in the sentence I want to tell him that the idea won&apos;t fly. Because pronouns like
him almost never take relative clauses, and because pronouns are known at the outset,
Lerner concludes that the clause beginning with that the is probably an argument of
the verb tell.&apos; It is always possible that it could be an argument of the previous verb
want, but Lerner treats that as unlikely. On the other hand, if the sentence were I want
to tell the boss that the idea won&apos;t fly, then Lerner cannot determine whether the clause
beginning with that the is an argument to tell or is instead related to boss, as in I want
to fire the boss that the workers don&apos;t trust.
Now consider specific cues for identifying argument phrases. The phrase types
for which data are reported here are noun phrases, infinitive verb phrases (VPs), and
tensed clauses. These phrase types yield three syntactic frames with a single argument
and three with two arguments, as shown in Table 1. The cues used for identifying
these frames are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 defines lexical categories that are
referred to in Table 3. The category V in Table 3 starts out empty and is filled as verbs
are detected on the first pass. &amp;quot;cap&amp;quot; stands for any capitalized word and &amp;quot;cap+&amp;quot; for
any sequence of capitalized words. These cues are applied by matching them against
the string of words immediately to the right of each verb. For example, a verb V is

2.3 Summary and Sample Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999063">
To summarize, the procedure for collecting observations from a corpus is as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9886789">
1. Go through the corpus once finding pairs of words such that one is the
result of adding the suffix -ing to the other, applying appropriate
morphological adjustment rules. List members of such pairs as verbs.
2. Go through the corpus again. At each word w that is on the list of verbs,
(a) If w is not preceded by a preposition or a determiner, increment
the number of times that w appears as a verb.
(b) If any of the cues listed in Table 3 match the words immediately
following w, increment the number of times that w appears to
occur in the corresponding frame.
3. Combine the data for the stem form and the -ing form.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999816909090909">
Table 4 shows an alphabetically contiguous portion of the observations table that
results from applying this procedure to the Brown Corpus (untagged). Each row rep-
resents data collected from one pair of words, including both the -ing form and the
stem form. The first column, titled V, represents the total number of times the word
occurs in positions where it could be functioning as a verb. Each subsequent column
represents a single frame. The number appearing in each row and column represents
the number of times that the row&apos;s verb cooccurred with cues for the column&apos;s frame.
Zeros are omitted. Thus recall and recalling occurred a combined total of 42 times,
excluding those occurrences that followed determiners or prepositions. Three of those
occurrences were followed by a cue for a single NP argument and four were followed
by cues for a tensed clause argument.

The cues are fairly rare, so verbs in Table 4 that occur fewer than 15 times tend
not to occur with these cues at all. Further, these cues occur fairly often in structures
other than those they are designed to detect. For example, record, recover, and refer all
occurred with cues for an infinitive, although none of them in fact takes an infinitive
argument. The sentences responsible for these erroneous observations are:

relation to the verb as the infinitive arguments of verbs like try, want, hope, ask, and
refuse. In (2d) refer is a verb but to change is a PP rather than an infinitive.
The remainder of this paper describes and evaluates a method for making judg-
ments about the ability of verbs to appear in particular syntactic frames on the basis
of noisy data like that of Table 4. Given the data in Table 4, that method yields the
judgments in Table 5.

3. Statistical Modeling
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983785714286">
As noted above, the correspondence between syntactic structure and the cues that
Lerner uses is not perfect. Mismatches between cue and structure are problematic
because naturally occurring language provides no negative evidence. If a V verb is
followed by a cue for some syntactic frame S, that provides evidence that V does occur
in frame S. but there is no analogous source of evidence that V does not occur in
frame S.
The occurrence of mismatches between cue and structure can be thought of as
a random process where each occurrence of a verb V has some non-zero probability
of being followed by a cue for a frame S, even if V cannot in fact occur in S. If this
model is accurate, the more times V occurs, the more likely it is to occur at least once
with a cue for S. The intransitive verb arrive, for example, will eventually occur with
a cue for an NP argument, if enough text is considered. A learner that considers a
single occurrence of verb followed by a cue to be conclusive evidence will eventually
come to the false conclusion that arrive is transitive. In other words, the information

provided by the cues will eventually be washed out by the noise. This problem is
inherent in learning from naturally occurring language, since infallible parsing is not
possible. The only way to prevent it is to consider the frequency with which each
verb occurs with cues for each frame. In other words, to consider each occurrence of
V without a cue for S as a small bit of evidence against V being able to occur in frame
S. This section describes a statistical technique for weighing such evidence.
Given a syntactic frame S, the statistical model treats each verb V as analogous
to a biased coin and each occurrence of V as analogous to a flip of that coin. An
occurrence that is followed by a cue for S corresponds to one outcome of the coin flip,
say heads; an occurrence without a cue for S corresponds to tails.&apos; If the cues were
perfect predictors of syntactic structure then a verb V that does not in fact occur in
frame S would never appear with cues for S—the coin would never come up heads.
Since the cues are not perfect, such verbs do occur with cues for S. The problem is to
determine when a verb occurs with cues for S often enough that all those occurrences
are unlikely to be errors.
In the following discussion, a verb that in fact occurs in frame S in the input is
described as a +S verb; one that does not is described as a -S verb. The statistical
model is based on the following approximation: for fixed S, all -S verbs have equal
probability of being followed by a cue for S. Let 7r, stand for that probability. 7r-s
may vary from frame to frame, but not from verb to verb. Thus, errors might be
more common for tensed clauses than for NPs, but the working hypothesis is that
all intransitives, such as saunter and arrive, are about equally likely to be followed by
a cue for an NP argument. If the error probability 77-__s were known, then we could
use the standard hypothesis testing method for binomial frequency data. For example,
suppose 7r„= .05—on average, one in twenty occurrences of a -S verb is followed by
a cue for S. If some verb V occurs 200 times in the corpus, and 20 of those occurrences
are followed by cues for S, that ought to suggest that V is unlikely to have probability
.05 of being followed by a cue for S, and hence V is unlikely to be -S. Specifically,
the chance of flipping 20 or more heads out of 200 tosses of a coin with a five percent
chance of coming up heads each time is less than three in 1000. On the other hand, it is
not all that unusual to flip 2 or more heads out of 20 on such a coin—it happens about
one time in four. If a verb occurs 20 times in the corpus and 2 of those occurrences
are followed by cues for S, it is quite possible that V is -S and that the 2 occurrences
with cues for S are explained by the five percent error rate on -S verbs.
The next section reviews the hypothesis-testing method and gives the formulas for
computing the probabilities of various outcomes of coin tosses, given the coin&apos;s bias.
It also provides empirical evidence that, for some values of 71-_„ hypothesis-testing
does a good job of distinguishing +S verbs from -S verbs that occur with cues for
S because of mismatches between cue and structure. The following section proposes
a method for estimating 7r_s and provides empirical evidence that its estimates are
nearly optimal.

The statistical component of Lerner is designed to prevent the information provided
by the cues from being washed out by the noise. The basic approach is hypothesis
testing on binomial frequency data (Kalbfleisch 1985). Specifically, a verb V is shown to

be +S by assuming that it is -S and then showing that if this were true, the observed
pattern of cooccurrence of V with cues for S would be extremely unlikely.
3.1.1 Binomial Frequency Data. In order to use the hypothesis testing method we
need to estimate the probability 7_, that an occurrence of a verb V will be followed
by a cue for S if V is -S. In this section it is assumed that 7_, is known. The next
section suggests a means of estimating 7_,. In both sections it is also assumed that for
each +S verb, V, the probability that V will be followed by a cue for S is greater than
7r_5. Other than that, no assumptions are made about the probability that a +S verb
will be followed by a cue for S. For example, two verbs with transitive senses, such as
cut and walk, may have quite different frequencies of cooccurrence with cues for NP.
It does not matter what these frequencies are as long as they are greater than r_Np.
If a coin has probability p of flipping heads, and if it is flipped n times, the prob-
ability of its coming up heads exactly m times is given by the binomial distribution:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9990555">
P(m,n,p) =
m!(n - m)!pmci -P)n-m
n!

<equation confidence="0.963195">
n
P(m+,n,p) =--- (2)
i-m
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99868848">
Analogously, P(m+,n,r_s) gives the probability that m or more occurrences of a -S
verb V will be followed by a cue for S out of n occurrences total.
If m out of n occurrences of V are followed by cues for S, and if P(m+,n,7r_s)
is quite small, then it is unlikely that V is -S. Traditionally, a threshold less than or
equal to .05 is set such that a hypothesis is rejected if, assuming the hypothesis were
true, the probability of outcomes as extreme as the observed outcome would be below
the threshold. The confidence attached to this conclusion increases as the threshold
decreases.
3.1.2 Experiment. The experiment presented in this section is aimed at determining
how well the method presented above can distinguish +S verbs from -S verbs. Let
P-s be an estimate of 7,. It is conceivable that P(m+,n,p_s) might not be a good
predictor of whether or not a verb is +S, regardless of the estimate p„. For example,
if the correspondence between the cues and the structures they are designed to detect
were quite weak, then many -S verbs might have lower P(m+,n,p,) than many
+S verbs. This experiment measures the accuracy of binomial hypothesis testing on
the data collected by Lerner&apos;s cues as a function of p_s. In addition to showing that
P(m+,n,p_s) is good for distinguishing +S and -S verbs, these data provide a baseline
against which to compare methods for estimating the error rate 7r_s.
Method The cues described in Section 2 were applied to the Brown Corpus (un-
tagged version). Equation 2 was applied to the resulting data with a cutoff of
P(m+,n,p,) &lt; .02 and p „ varying between 2-5 (1 error in every 32 occurrences)
and 2-13 (1 error in every 8192 occurrences). The resulting judgments were compared
to the blind judgments of a single judge. One hundred ninety-three distinct verbs
were chosen at random from the tagged version of the Brown Corpus for comparison.
Common verbs are more likely to be included in the test sample than rare verbs, but

no verb is included more than once. Each verb was scored for a given frame only
if it cooccurs with a cue for that frame at least once. Thus, although 193 verbs were
randomly selected from the corpus for scoring, only the 63 that cooccur with a cue for
tensed clause at least once were scored for the tensed-clause frame. This procedure
makes it possible to evaluate the hypothesis-testing method on data collected by the
cues, rather than evaluating the cues per se. It also makes the judgment task much
easier-it is not necessary to determine whether a verb can appear in a frame in prin-
ciple, only whether it does so in particular sentences. There were, however, five cases
where the judgments were unclear. These five were not scored. See Appendix C for
details.
Results The results of these comparisons are summarized in Table 6 (tensed clause)
and Table 7 (infinitive). Each row shows the performance of the hypothesis-testing
procedure for a different estimate p_s of the error-rate 7r_s. The first column shows
the negative logarithm of p,, which is varied from 5 (1 error in 32 occurrences) to
13 (1 error in 8192 occurrences). The second column shows p„ in decimal notation.
The next four columns show the number of true positives (TP)-verbs judged +S both
by machine and by hand; false positives (FP)-verbs judged -1-S by machine, -S by
hand; true negatives (TN)-verbs judged -S both by machine and by hand; and false
negatives (FN)-verbs judged -S by machine, -FS by hand. The numbers represent
distinct verbs, not occurrences. The seventh column shows the number of verbs that
were misclassified (MC)-the sum of false positives and false negatives. The eighth
column shows the percentage of verbs that were misclassified (%MC). The next-to-last
column shows the precision (PRE)-the true positives divided by all verbs that Lerner
judged to be +S. The final column shows the recall (REC)-the true positives divided
by all verbs that were judged +S by hand.
Discussion For verbs taking just a tensed clause argument, Table 6 shows that,
given the right estimate p, of 7r._5, it is possible to classify these 63 verbs with only 1
false positive and 8 false negatives. If the error rate were ignored or approximated as
zero then the false positives would go up to 19. On the other hand, if the error rate
were taken to be as high as 1 in 25 then the false negatives would go up to 20. In this
case, the sum of both error types is minimized with 2-8 &lt;Pcl&lt; 2-10. Table 7 shows
similar results for verbs taking just an infinitive argument, where misclassifications
are minimized with p_mf = 2-7.

3.2 Estimating the Error Rate

As before, assume that an occurrence of a -S verb is followed by a cue for S with
probability 71-. Also as before, assume that for each +S verb V. the probability that
an occurrence of V is followed by a cue for S is greater than ir„.
It is useful to think of the verbs in the corpus as analogous to a large bag of
coins with various biases, or probabilities of coming up heads. The only assumption
about the distribution of biases is that there is some definite but unknown minimum
bias 7r„.5 Determining whether or not a verb appears in frame S is analogous to
determining, for some randomly selected coin, whether its bias is greater than 7r„.
The only available evidence comes from selecting a number of coins at random and
flipping them. The previous section showed how this can be done given an estimate
of 7r_s.
Suppose a series of coins is drawn at random from the bag. Each coin is flipped N
times. It is then assigned to a histogram bin representing the number of times it came
up heads. At the end of this sampling procedure bin i contains the number of coins
that came up heads exactly i times out of N. Such a histogram is shown in Figure 1,
where N = 40. If N is large enough and enough coins are flipped N times, one would
expect the following:

<listItem confidence="0.793128333333333">
1. The coins whose probability of turning up heads is 7r, (the minimum)
should cluster at the low-heads end of the histogram. That is, there
should be some 0 &lt;10 &lt; N such that most of the coins that turn up Jo
heads or fewer have probability 7r_„ and, conversely, most coins with
probability 7r_s turn up jo heads or fewer.
2. Suppose Jo were known. Then the portion of the histogram below Jo
should have a roughly binomial shape. In Figure 1, for example, the first
eight bins have roughly the shape one would expect if jo were 8. In
contrast, the first 16 bins do not have the shape one would expect if Jo

The estimation procedure tries out each bin as a possible estimate of Jo. Each estimate
of Jo leads to an estimate of 7r, and hence to an expected shape for the first Jo histogram
bins. Each estimate j of Jo is evaluated by comparing the predicted distribution in the
first j bins to the observed distribution—the better the fit, the better the estimate.
Moving from coins to verbs, the procedure works as follows. For some fixed N,
consider the first N occurrences of each verb that occurs at least N times in the input.
(A uniform sample size N is needed only for estimating 7r_5. Given an estimate of 7r-5,
verbs with any number of occurrences can be classified.) Let S be some syntactic frame
and let H[i] be the number of distinct verbs that were followed by cues for S exactly
i times out of N—i.e., the height of the ith histogram bin. Assume that there is some
1 &lt; Jo &lt; N such that most -S verbs are followed by cues for S Jo times or fewer, and
conversely most verbs that are followed by cues for S Jo times or fewer are -S verbs.
For each possible estimate j of Jo there is a corresponding estimate of 7r_s; namely, the
average rate at which verbs in the first j bins are followed by cues for S. Choosing
the most plausible estimate of 7_5 thus comes down to choosing the most plausible
estimate of Jo, the boundary between the -S verbs and the rest of the histogram. To
evaluate the plausibility of each possible estimate j of Jo, measure the fit between the
predicted distribution of -S verbs, assuming j is the boundary of the -S cluster, and
the observed distribution of the -S verbs, also assuming j is the boundary of the -S
cluster. Given j, let p_s stand for the average rate at which verbs in bins j or lower
are followed by cues for S. The predicted distribution for -S verbs is proportional to
P(i,N,p_s) for 0 &lt; i &lt; N. The observed distribution of -S verbs, assuming j is the
boundary of the -S cluster, is H[i] for 0 &lt; i &lt;j and 0 for j &lt; i &lt; N. Measure the fit
between the predicted and observed distributions by normalizing both to have unit
area and taking the sum over 0 &lt; i &lt; N of the squares of the differences between the
two distributions at each bin i.

the results for each of the six frames. Varying N between 50 and 150 results in no
significant change in the estimated error rates.
One way to judge the value of the estimation and hypothesis-testing methods is to
examine the false positives. Three of the five false positives result from errors in verb
detection that are not distributed uniformly across verbs. In particular, shock, board, and
near are used more often as nonverbs than as verbs. This creates many opportunities
for nonverbal occurrences of these words to be mistaken for verbal occurrences. Other
verbs, like know, are unambiguous and thus are not subject to this type of error. As a
result, these errors violate the model&apos;s assumption that errors are distributed uniformly
across verbs and highlight the limitations of the model. The remaining false positives
were touch and belong, both mistaken as taking an NP followed by a tensed clause.
The touch error was caused by the capitalization of the first word of a line of poetry:
I knew not what did to a friend belong
Till I stood up, true friend, by thy true side;
Till was mistaken for a proper name. The belong error was caused by mistaking a
matrix clause for an argument in:
With the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill
caressing the flageolet with his lips, making it whisper.
It seems likely that such input would be much rarer in more mundane sources of text,
such as newspapers of record, than in the diverse Brown Corpus.
The results for infinitives and clauses can also be judged by comparison to the
optimal classifications rates from Tables 6 and 7. In both cases the classification appears
to be right in the optimal range. In fact, the estimated error rate for infinitives produces
a better classification than any of those shown in Table 7. (It falls at a value between
those shown.) The classification of clauses and infinitives remains in the optimal range
when the probability threshold is varied from .01 to .05.
Overall the tradeoff between improved precision and reduced recall seems quite
good, as compared to doing no noise reduction (p_s --= 0). The only possible excep-
tion is the NP frame, where noise reduction causes 59 false negatives in exchange
for preventing only 5 false positives. This is partly explained by the different prior
probabilities of the different frames. Most verbs can take a direct object argument,
whereas most verbs cannot take a direct object argument followed by a tensed clause
argument. There is no way to know this in advance. There may be other factors as
well. If the error rate for the NP cues is substantially lower than 1 out of 100, then it
cannot be estimated accurately with sample size N = 100. On the other hand, if the
sample size N is increased substantially there may not be enough verbs that occur N
times or more in the corpus. So a larger corpus might improve the recall rate for NP.

This paper explores the possibility of using simple grammatical regularities to learn
lexical syntax. The data presented in Tables 6, 7, and 8 provide evidence that it is

these data suggest that neither a large parser nor a large lexicon is needed to recover
enough syntactic structure for learning lexical syntax. Rather, it seems that significant

lexical syntactic information can be recovered using a few approximate cues along
with statistical inference based on a simple model of the cues&apos; error distributions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997905">
4.1 Other Syntactic Frames
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965071428571">
The lexical entry of a verb can specify other syntactic frames in addition to the six
studied here. In particular, many verbs take prepositional phrases (PPs) headed by
a particular preposition or class of prepositions. For example, put requires a location
as a second argument, and locations are often represented by PPs headed by locative
prepositions.
Extending Lerner to detect PPs is trivial. Since the set of prepositions in the lan-
guage is essentially fixed, all prepositions can be included in the initial lexicon. De-
tecting a PP requires nothing more than detecting a preposition.&apos; The statistical model
can, of course, be applied without modification.
The problem, however, is determining which PPs are arguments and which are
adjuncts. There are clearly cases where a prepositional phrase can occur in a clause
not by virtue of the lexical entry of the verb but rather by virtue of nonlexical facts of
English syntax. For instance, almost any verb can occur with a temporal PP headed
by on, as in John arrived on Monday. Such PPs are called adjuncts. On the other hand,
the sense of on in John sprayed water on the ceiling is quite different. This sense, it can be
argued, is available only because the lexical entry of spray specifies a location argument
that can be realized as a PP. If anything significant is to be learned about individual
words, the nonspecific cooccurrences of verbs with PPs (adjuncts) must be separated
from the specific ones (arguments). It is not clear how a machine learning system
could do this, although frequency might provide some clue. Worse, however, there
are many cases in which even trained linguists lack clear intuitions. Despite a number
of attempts to formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for the argument/adjunct
distinction (e.g., Jackendoff 1977), there are many cases for which the various criteria
do not agree or the judgments are unclear (Adams and Macfarland 1991). Thus, the
Penn Treebank does not make the argument/adjunct distinction because their judges
do not agree often enough. Until a useful definition that trained humans can agree on
is developed, it would seem fruitless to attempt machine learning experiments in this
domain.

4.2 Limitations of the Statistical Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951692307692">
Although the results of this study are generally encouraging, they also point to some
limitations of the statistical model presented here. First, it does not take into account
variation in the percentage of verbs that can appear in each frame. For example, most
verbs can take an NP argument, while very few can take an NP followed by a tensed
clause. This results in too few verbs being classified as +NP and too many being clas-
sified as +NPcl, as shown in Table 8. Second, it does not take into account the fact
that for some words with verbal senses most of their occurrences are verbal, whereas
for others most of their occurrences are nonverbal. For example, operate occurs ex-
clusively as a verb while board occurs much more often as a noun than as a verb.
Since the cues are based on the assumption that the word in question is a verb, board
presents many more opportunities for error than operate. This violates the assump-
tion that the probability of error for a given frame is approximately uniform across
verbs.

These limitations do not constitute a major impediment to applications of the cur-
rent results. For example, an applied system can be provided with the rough estimates
that 80-95 percent of verbs take a direct object, while 1-2 percent take a direct object
followed by a tensed clause. Such estimates can be expected to reduce misclassifica-
tion significantly. Further, an existing dictionary could be used to &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; a statistical
model on familiar verbs. A trained system would probably be more accurate in clas-
sifying new verbs. Finally, the lexical ambiguity problem could probably be reduced
substantially in the applied context by using a statistical tagging program (Brill 1992;
Church 1988).
For addressing basic questions in machine learning of natural language the solu-
tions outlined above are not attractive. All of those solutions provide the learner with
additional specific knowledge of English, whereas the goal for the machine learning
effort should be to replace specific knowledge with general knowledge about the types
of regularities to be found in natural language.
There is one approach to the lexical ambiguity problem that does not require
giving the learner additional specific knowledge. The problem is as follows: words
that occur frequently as, say, nouns are likely to have a different error rate from
unambiguous verbs. If it were known which words occur primarily as verbs and
which occur primarily as nouns then separate error rate estimates could be made
for each. This would reduce the rate of false positive errors even without any further
information about which particular occurrences are nominal and which are verbal. One
way to distinguish primarily nominal words from primarily verbal words is by the
relative frequencies of their various inflected forms. For example, Table 9 shows the
contrast in the distribution of inflected forms between project and board on the one hand
and operate and follow on the other. Project and board are two words whose frequent
occurrence as nouns has caused Lerner to make false positive errors. In both cases,
the stem and -s forms are much more common than the -ed and -ing forms. Compare
this to the distribution for the unambiguous verbs operate and follow. In these cases the
diversity of frequencies is much lower and does not display the characteristic pattern
of a word that occurs primarily as a noun— -ing and -ed forms that are much rarer
than the -s and stem forms. Similar characteristic patterns exist for words that occur
primarily as adjectives. Recognizing such ambiguity patterns automatically would
allow a separate error rate to be estimated for the highly ambiguous words.

phological adjustment rules according to which, for example, the final &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; of bite is
deleted when the suffix -ing is added, yielding biting rather than *&amp;quot;biteing.&amp;quot; Lerner
needs to know such rules in order to determine whether or not a given word occurs
both with and without the suffix -ing. Experiments are under way on an unsupervised
procedure that learns such rules from English text, given only the list of English verbal
suffixes. This work is being extended further in the direction of discovering the mor-
phemic suffixes themselves and discovering the ways in which these suffixes alternate
in paradigms. The short-term goal is to develop algorithms that can learn the rules of
inflection in English starting from only a corpus and a general notion of the nature of
morphological regularities.
Ultimately, this line of inquiry may lead to algorithms that can learn much of
the grammar of a language starting with only a corpus and a general theory of the
kinds of formal regularities to be found in natural languages. Some elements of syntax
may not be learnable in this way (Lightfoot 1991), but the lexicon, morphology, and
phonology together make up a substantial portion of the grammar of a language. If
it does not prove possible to learn these aspects of grammar starting from a general
ontology of linguistic regularities and using distributional analysis then that, too, is
an interesting result. It would suggest that the task requires a more substantive initial
theory of possible grammars, or some semantic information about input sentences, or
both. In any case this line of inquiry promises to shed light on the nature of language,
learning, and language learning.

Of the 193 verbs listed above, Lerner detects 174 in the untagged version of the Brown
Corpus. Of these 174, there are 87 for which Lerner does not find sufficient evidence
to prove that they have any of the six syntactic frames in question. Some of these
genuinely do not appear in the corpus with cues for any of the six, while others do
appear with cues, but not often enough to provide reliable evidence. Given more text,
sufficient evidence might eventually accumulate for many of these verbs.
The 87 that were detected but not assigned any frames are as follows:

Provided and providing do not appear to be functioning as verbs when they take a tensed
clause. Tensed forms of provide do not take a tensed clause, as in *&amp;quot;She {provided,
provides} that he have enough to live on.&amp;quot; However, the infinitive form of provide in
(3b) is clearly functioning as a verb. The best generalization of these observations is
unclear.
Act with an infinitive
(4) &amp;quot;E. B.&amp;quot; compared John Brown to Moses in that they were both acting to
deliver millions from oppression.
In (4), it is not clear whether the infinitive is an argument, as it would be in &amp;quot;they
were both trying to deliver ...,&amp;quot; or a purpose adjunct, as in &amp;quot;they were both breaking
the law to deliver ....&amp;quot;
Live with an infinitive
Live occurred twice in the expression live to see and once in the expression live to hear.
If this expression were completely fixed, then its properties should not be considered
properties of the verb live. However, the infinitive can be any perception verb and
possibly a few others. The expression is limited, but not frozen, so the appropriate
conclusion is unclear.
Work with a single NP
Work takes a direct object in the sense meaning form or mold. The cues do not detect
this sense of work in the corpus, but they do find it followed by adverbial NPs such
as &amp;quot;every day&amp;quot; and in the expression work their will.
Give with a single NP
Lerner judged give to take a single NP based on seven examples of which six were
mistaken. The seventh was the sentence &amp;quot;They continued to give an arm-elevation.&amp;quot;
This is ungrammatical in my dialect, but it is clearly an example of give with a single
NP complement.

<abstract confidence="0.972675833333333">Imagine a language that is completely unfamiliar; the only means of studying it are an ordinary grammar book and a very large corpus of text. No dictionary is available. How can easily recognized, surface grammatical facts be used to extract from a corpus as much syntactic information as possible about individual words? This paper describes an approach based on two principles. First, rely on local morpho-syntactic cues to structure rather than trying to parse entire sentences. Second, treat these cues as probabilistic rather than absolute indicators of syntactic structure. Apply inferential statistics to the data collected using the cues, rather than drawing a categorical conclusion from a single occurrence of a cue. The effectiveness of this approach for inferring the syntactic frames of verbs is supported by experiments on an English corpus using a program called Lerner. Lerner starts out with no knowledge of content words—it bootstraps from determiners, auxiliaries, modals, prepositions, pronouns, complementizers, coordinating conjunctions, and punctuation.</abstract>

It is not clear how a machine learning system could do this, although frequency might provide some clue. Worse, however, there are many cases in which even trained linguists lack clear intuitions. Despite a number of attempts to formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for the argument/adjunct distinction (e.g., Jackendoff 1977), there are many cases for which the various criteria do not agree or the judgments are unclear (Adams and Macfarland 1991). Thus, the Penn Treebank does not make the argument/adjunct distinction because their judges do not agree often enough. Until a useful definition that trained humans can agree on is developed, it would seem fruitless to attempt machine learning experiments in this domain. 4.2 Limitations of the Statistical Model Although the results of this study are generally encouraging, they also point to some limitations of the statistical model presented here.

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to design a system that autonomously learns syntactic frames from naturally occurring text. The goal of learning syntactic frames and the learning framework described above lead to three major differences between the approach reported here and most recent work in learning grammar from text. First, this approach leverages a little a priori grammatical knowledge using statistical inference. Most work on corpora of naturally occurring language 244 Michael R. Brent From Grammar to Lexicon either uses no a priori grammatical knowledge (Brill and Marcus 1992; Ellison 1991; Finch and Chater 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992), or else it relies on a large and complex grammar (Hindle 1990, 1991).

The second stage is necessary because of lexical ambiguity. The first stage uses the fact that all English verbs can occur both with and without the suffix -ing. Words are taken as potential verbs if and only if they display this alternation in the corpus.2 There are a few words that meet this criterion but do not occur as verbs, including income/incoming (*incame/incomed), ear/earring, her/herring, and middle/middling. However, the second stage of verb detection, combined with the statistical criteria, prevent these pairs from introducing errors. 1 Brill and Marcus (1992) use a single grammatical rule in the test phase to supplement the rules their system learns, but no grammatical knowledge is used in the learning phase. 2 Morphological analyzers typically use a root lexicon to resolve the ambiguities in morphological adjustment rules (Karttunen 1983). The system described here uses rules similar to those of Karttunen and Wittenburg (1983), but it resolves the ambiguities using only the contents of the corpus. This technique will be described in a subsequent paper. 245 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 Lerner assumes that a potential verb is funct</context>

It focuses on discovering the kinds of syntactic phrases that can be used to represent the semantic arguments of particular verbs. For example, want can take an infinitive argument and hope a tensed clause argument, but not vice versa: (1) a. John wants Mary to be happy. b. John hopes that Mary is happy. c. *John wants that Mary is happy. d. *John hopes Mary to be happy. This study focuses on the ability of verbs to take arguments represented by infinitives, tensed clauses, and noun phrases serving as both direct and indirect objects. These lexical properties are similar to those that Chomsky (1965) termed subcategorization frames, but to avoid confusion the properties under study here will be referred to as syntactic frames or simply frames.

If anything significant is to be learned about individual words, the nonspecific cooccurrences of verbs with PPs (adjuncts) must be separated from the specific ones (arguments). It is not clear how a machine learning system could do this, although frequency might provide some clue. Worse, however, there are many cases in which even trained linguists lack clear intuitions. Despite a number of attempts to formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for the argument/adjunct distinction (e.g., Jackendoff 1977), there are many cases for which the various criteria do not agree or the judgments are unclear (Adams and Macfarland 1991). Thus, the Penn Treebank does not make the argument/adjunct distinction because their judges do not agree often enough. Until a useful definition that trained humans can agree on is developed, it would seem fruitless to attempt machine learning experiments in this domain. 4.2 Limitations of the Statistical Model Although the results of this study are generally encouraging, they also point to some limitations of the statistical model presented here.

The following section proposes a method for estimating 7r_s and provides empirical evidence that its estimates are nearly optimal. 3.1 Hypothesis Testing The statistical component of Lerner is designed to prevent the information provided by the cues from being washed out by the noise. The basic approach is hypothesis testing on binomial frequency data (Kalbfleisch 1985). Specifically, a verb V is shown to 4 Given a verb V, the outcomes of the coins for different S&apos;s are treated as approximately independent, even though they cannot be perfectly independent.
