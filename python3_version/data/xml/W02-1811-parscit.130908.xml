This is a pilot study which aims at the design of a
Chinese morphological analyzer which is in state
to predict the syntactic and semantic properties of
nominal, verbal and adjectival compounds.
Morphological structures of compound words
contain the essential information of knowing their
syntactic and semantic characteristics. In
particular, morphological analysis is a primary
step for predicting the syntactic and semantic
categories of out-of-vocabulary (unknown) words.
The designed Chinese morphological analyzer
contains three major functions, 1) to segment a
word into a sequence of morphemes, 2) to tag the
part-of-speech of those morphemes, and 3) to
identify the morpho-syntactic relation between
morphemes. We propose a method of using
associative strength among morphemes,
morpho-syntactic patterns, and syntactic
categories to solve the ambiguities of
segmentation and part-of-speech. In our
evaluation report, it is found that the accuracy of
our analyzer is 81%. 5% errors are caused by the
segmentation and 14% errors are due to
part-of-speech. Once the internal information of a
compound is known, it would be beneficial for the
further researches of the prediction of a word
meaning and its function.

This is the first attempt to design a morphological
analyzer to automatically analyze the
morphological structures of Chinese compound
words1. Morphological structures of compound
words contain the essential information of
knowing their syntactic and semantic
characteristics. In particular, morphological
analysis is a primary step for predicting the
syntactic and semantic categories of
out-of-vocabulary (unknown) words. The
existence of unknown words is a major obstacle in

fact that new words are easily coined by
morphemes in Chinese text, the number of
unknown words is increasingly large. As a result,
we cannot collect all the unknown words and
manually mark their syntactic categories and
meanings. Our hypothesis to predict the category
and the meaning of a word is basically based on
Frege’s principle: “The meaning of the whole is a
function of the meanings of the parts”. The
meanings of morphemes are supposed to make up
the meanings of the words. However, some words
like idioms and proper nouns cannot be included
in the principle. In general, unknown words could
be divided into two different types: the type that
has the property of semantic transparency, i.e. the
words whose meanings can be derived from their
morphemes and the type without meaning
transparency, such as proper nouns. In this paper
we are dealing with the compound words with
semantic transparency only. For the type of
compounds without semantic transparency, such
as proper nouns, their morphemes and
morphological structures do not provide useful
information for predicting their syntactic and
semantic categories. Therefore they are processed
differently and independently. In addition, some
regular types of compounds, such as numbers,
dates, and determinant-measure compounds, are
easily analyzed by matching their morphological
structures with their regular expression grammars
and the result can be used to predict their syntactic
and semantic properties, so they will be handled
by matching regular expressions at the stage of
word segmentation. According to our observation,
most Chinese compounds have semantic
transparency except proper nouns, which means
the meaning of an unknown word can be
interpreted by their own morpheme components.
The design of our morphological analyzer will
focus on processing these compounds, but words
without semantic transparency are excluded. It
takes a compound word as input and produces the
morphological structure of the word. The major
functions are 1) to segment a word into a sequence
of morphemes, 2) to tag the part-of-speech of
those morphemes, and 3) to identify the
morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes.
Once the morpho-syntactic structure of a
compound is known, the head morpheme provides
the major clue for determining its syntactic and
semantic category.
It seems that a Chinese morphological analyzer is
similar to a tagging program. Indeed both systems
have to resolve the segmentation and tagging
ambiguities. However the major difference is that
the morphological analyzer does not have
contextual information of each target word. In
other words, morphological structures of
compounds are context independent. We cannot
apply the same methods, such as n-gram language
models, to resolve the ambiguities. We proposed a
method of using the associative strength among
morphemes, morpho-syntactic patterns, and
syntactic categories to solve the ambiguities.
Detail algorithms for morpheme segmentation,
part-of-speech, and morpho-syntactic relation
assignment are discussed in Section 2. In the final
section, we will evaluate the morphological
analyzer by comparing its results with those
obtained from the analyses of 5 linguists and
discussing the categorization of errors found.

2. The Morphological Analyzer

<bodyText confidence="0.998006">
The morphological analyzer contains three
functions: to segment a word, to tag the
part-of-speech (POS) of morphemes, and to
identify the relation between them.

2.1 Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988972">
The goal of this process is to segment a compound
word into a sequence of morphemes. Since there
are ambiguous segmentations, simple dictionary
look-up methods may not work well. For instance,
the compound of meiguoren ( ) could be
ambiguously segmented into either mei-guoren
([ [ ]] beautiful countryman) or meiguo-ren
([[ ] ] American people), but only
meiguo-ren ([[ ] ] American-people) is the
proper segmentation. The left-to-right longest
matching method is commonly applied to segment
either words or text. It works well, but there are
still some small percent of compound words that
cannot be properly segmented by such a simple
algorithm. For instance, the word xin-shenghuo
([ [ ]] new life) will be segmented wrongly
into xinsheng-huo ([[ ] ] the life of a new
student) without considering the priority of
segmenting the affix xin ( new) first. In
particular, words with multi-syllabic suffixes and
words with reduplication constructions commonly
cause segmentation errors. Those special types of
words should be analyzed with other methods.
</bodyText>

2.1.1 Affixes and reduplication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978844375">
In order to remedy the segmentation error caused
by the left-to-right longest matching, we observe
the results of the algorithm and find that there are
two useful clues to avoid segmentation errors, i.e.
the information of affix and reduplication.
A word of a reduplication pattern cannot and need
not be segmented by the longest left-to-right
method, since it has special morphological
structures and the reduplication patterns bring
enough clues of knowing the syntactic functions
of the word. Therefore we try to identify words
that belong to reduplication patterns first. In
general they fall into the following two types of
patterns: reduplications and parallel words. Words,
which do not conform to these patterns, will be
segmented later.

<bodyText confidence="0.999522421052632">
Reduplication means to duplicate the one or two
character words into multi-character words. All
reduplication patterns we used are listed in Table 1.
If a word belongs to a reduplication pattern, the
meaning of the word doesn’t change too much.
The reduplication word’s category can be
predicted by their patterns. For example, when B
is not a noun, a word which belongs to the pattern
AAB is intransitive verb. The category of a word
that belongs to the pattern of “parallel word” is
always a noun. The characteristic of parallel
words is that both AC and BC are words with
shared head word C.
At the next step of the morpheme segmentation,
we will consider the compounds with affixes. The
most productive compound construction is the
structure of a morpheme plus an affix. Hence after
the affix is identified, it would be easier to
segment a word into two parts. The segmentation
algorithm works as follows. A word is segmented
immediately only if a prefix, infix or suffix
morpheme is found. The affix table contains 186
prefixes, 2 infixes and 648 suffixes. Some affixes
of the table are multi-syllabic. To segment an affix
with higher priority will resolve most of the errors
caused by the left-to-right longest matching
algorithm. For instance, if tiaoshangqu (
to jump up) is segmented by the left-to-right
longest matching method, and the result of the
segmentation is tiaoshang-qu. The left-to-right
longest matching method might cause error
segmentation here. However, shangqu is one of
the suffixes in the affix table, so in our
morphological analyzer it would be segmented as
tiao-shangqu. A word containing an infix is also
not suitable for the general segmentation and it
would be segmented into single character. There
are some affixes examples in Table 2:

</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924428571428">
If a word is neither reduplication nor a compound
with an affix, it should be segmented from left to
right with longest matching. This general method
can segment words into morphemes and also
provide a possible part-of-speech of each
morpheme by looking it up in the morpheme
dictionary.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998876">
2.2 Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998170967742">
The work here is to provide the part-of-speech for
each morpheme and identify a morpho-syntactic
relation between two morphemes based on the
information of segmentation and their pos. This is
the most difficult part of morphological analysis.
In achieving the goal, we face two obstacles: the
information insufficiency of morpheme categories
and morphemes with the multiple categories.
Since morpheme categories are not the same as
word categories, it is necessary to assign each
morpheme with appropriate categories and to
compile a morpheme dictionary. Once the
morpheme dictionary is built, the remaining job is
to resolve the part-of-speech ambiguities of each
morpheme. Since the part-of-speech of the
morpheme is independent of its word level context,
we cannot apply n-gram like language models to
resolve part-of-speech ambiguity of morphemes.
Even worse, there is no structure tagging training
data available either. An EM-like unsupervised
training on part-of-speech morphological
structures is also not a sensible solution, since
morpho-syntactic structure is more sensitive to the
semantic combination than the syntactic
combination of morphemes. Therefore we propose
a method of using morphemes to predict the
possible syntactic categories of the target
compound word and selecting the most probable
consistent result among the candidates of
part-of-speech structures and the predicted
categories.

2.2.1 Preparation of the morpheme
</subsectionHeader>

dictionary
Before we start to tag morphemes, two steps are
carried out to resolve the obstacles. That is the
lack for a morpheme dictionary and morpheme
ambiguity. First, in order to resolve the lack for
morpheme categories, it is necessary to edit an
affix table, as mentioned in Section 2.1, which
contains prefixes, infixes, suffixes and their
categories. Most frequently encountered 186
prefixes and 648 suffixes are listed in this table.
Basically, if its morpheme has more than 2
characters, we adopt its categories in the CKIP
Dictionary. Conversely, if it has fewer than 2
characters and it functions as a prefix or a suffix,
we use the categories in the affix table.
Below we illustrate two examples to explain the
need of morpheme categories. Both words yu (
to speak) and wu ( to dance) are verbs.
However they could also function as morphemes.
When they function as morphemes, they are listed
as nouns in their category. It is worth noticing that
the categories of a morpheme are not the same as
those of a word, even if they are in the same form.
Therefore, it is important to assign morphemes
categories properly.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.957219">

suffix word
-yu( ) Na VE ying-yu( ),
de-yu( )
-wu( ) Na VC, Na jueshi-wu( )
2 The category symbols here are based on CKIP(1993).
The meaning of each category we adopt here is as
following: A(non-predicative adjective), Na(common
noun), Nb(proper noun), Nc(location noun), Nd(time
noun), VA(active intransitive verb), VB(semi-transitive
verb), VC(active transitive verb), VCL(active transitive
verb with locative object), VD(ditransitive verb),
VE(active transitive verb with sentential object),
VG(classificatory verb), VH(stative intransitive verb),
VHC(stative causative verb), VJ(stative transitive verb)
and so on.
Second, in order to resolve the problem of
morpheme ambiguity, we need a list of
probabilities which contains all the possible
combinations of categorical rules and their
probabilities. For instance, in the list the
probability P(Na+Na|Na) = 0.4692 means that the
categorical rule of combining two common nouns
(Na+Na) to form a common noun (Na) has the
probability 0.4692. The probability values of each
categorical rule were estimated from the set of
11,322 unknown words extracted from Sinica
Corpus 3.0. The syntactic category of each
extracted word is known but its structure
annotation is unknown. Therefore the probability
of each categorical rule is roughly estimated by
assuming that every ambiguous categorical
combination of a word have equal probability.
The process of computing the possibility of a
combination is as follows:
1) We assign morphemes in a word with all their
possible categories found in the dictionary and the
affix table; for example, sheyingzhan ([[ ] ]
photography exhibition), which belongs to Na
category means “photography exhibition”.
Sheyingzhan could be segmented as sheying (
photography) and zhan ( exhibition). After
segmentation, we found sheying with the
categories Na and VA, and zhan with the category
Na. The possible combinations of sheying-zhan
are “Na+Na-&gt;Na” and “VA+Na-&gt;Na”. However,
we don’t know which one is correct, so we
presumably assign a frequency of 0.5 to each
combination.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975167166666667">
2) After we assign morphemes their categories and
frequencies, we add up the frequencies of
identical combinations. A list containing possible
categorical rules and their probabilities is then
established. Table 4 shows a part of the
categorical rules of VHC.

</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998715027777778">
Once the affix table and the list of categorical
rules are prepared, we can tackle the problems of
the obstacles we mentioned in the beginning.
After morpheme segmentation, each morpheme is
assigned with their proper categories according to
the morpheme dictionary and the affix table.
However, morphemes might be ambiguous, so if
the category of the target word is known, the most
probable part-of-speech combination is chosen
based on the list of categorical rules. However in
the real implementation, it is assumed that the
syntactic category of a target word is not known.
The method mentioned above would not work,
unless its syntactic category can be predicted. In
our implementation, we adopted the method
proposed by Chen, Bai and Chen (1997), by using
the association strength between morphemes and
categories to predict the syntactic categories of
target words. By using the mutual information
between affixes and categories, the top one
prediction has the accuracy of 67.00% and the top
three accuracy of the prediction can reach about
94.02%. We will then check the consistency
between predicted the categories and their
morpho-syntactic structures to make the final
judgments on both the word category prediction
and the morpheme category disambiguation.
The final prediction is based on the maximal value
of the combined probabilities of the category
prediction and the categorical rule prediction.
Since P(Rule|compound) = P(Cat|compound) *
P(Rule|Cat, compound) ≅ P(Cat|compound) *
P(Rule|Cat), we try to find Cat and Rule which
maximizes P(Cati|compound) * P(Rulej|Cati), for
all Cati and Rulej. The following is an example
of .she-ying-zhan.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.948975375">
====================================
sheying-zhan ( photography exhibition)
P(Na|sheying-zhan) *P(Na+Na|Na)= 0.6324*0.4692=0.2967

sheying-zhan=(Na+Na)-&gt;Na
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991294565217392">
====================================
The top1 accuracy of the original category
prediction for unknown words is 67% by mutual
information, but after the combination of the
morphological analyzer, the accuracy of the word
category prediction is raised to 71%. This is
because the morphological analyzer will check if
the categorical combination in a word is in its
proper category. Therefore, when the original
unknown word prediction system predicts a word
in a category which the morphological analyzer
finds the probability of its categorical combination
in the category low, the morphological analyzer
might reject the category and suggest the
unknown word prediction system to choose the
next highest-scoring category in which the
categorical combination has higher probability.
In the case that the syntactic category of the
compound word is known, we will let
P(Cat|compound) = 1 and the most probable
part-of-speech combination will simply be the
categorical rule Rulej such that P(Rulej|Cat) is
maximized.

2.2.3 Morpho-syntactic relation between
morphemes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910255319149">
Once the information of segmentation and
part-of-speech is ready, the morpho-syntactic
relation between morphemes can be identified.
According to Chao (1968) and Li&amp;Thompson
(1981), there are relations between morphemes in
compounds such as “modifier-hear”, “predicate
object” and so on. The purpose of knowing
morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes is
to help decide the meaning of the target word. The
morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes is
grouped into the types listed in Table 5. Generally,
the relation between morphemes is highly related
to the category of an unknown word. So the
relation we assign to morphemes must be based
on the category of the word. When the unknown
word is a noun, the relation between its
morphemes is “modifier-head”. If it’s a verb, it
will be more complicated. There are five relation
types in verbs. The first one is “verb-object”, such
as chifan ( to eat rice). The first morpheme
must be a transitive one and the second one should
be a noun. The second type of the relation is
“modifier-head”, and it means the second
morpheme is the semantic head of the word. The
third type is “resultative verb”. The second
morpheme in this type’s word always expresses
the result of the action. The forth type is
“head-suffix”. The appearance of the suffix
changes the augment structure of the head verb,
but the representing event remains the same.
These suffixes are ru ( to be similar to), yu (
by), wei ( to become), gei ( to give), chu (
to exit) and cheng ( to become). The fifth type
of the relation is “modifier-head”, and there is
only a morpheme hua ( to transform) which
belongs to this type. Hua is the head of a word. If
a non-predicative adjective is an adjective, there
are two kinds of structure. First, a
non-predicative adjective has the same structure
as a noun. The relation between its morphemes is
also called “modifier-head”. Second, the relation
between morphemes for a non-predicative
adjective which cannot be in the predicate
position but has verbs structures can be
“predicate-object” or “modifier head”. This
information will be helpful for predicting the core
meaning of a new word.

Once the morpho-syntactic structure of a
compound is identified, the head morpheme
provides the major clue for determining its
syntactic and semantic category. The compound
word will inherit from the semantic and syntactic
property of its head and the information will be
beneficial for the semantic and syntactic
categorization of new compound words in the
future.

The major functions of the morphological
analyzer are to segment a word into a sequence of
morphemes, to tag the part-of-speech of the
morphemes, and to identify the morpho-syntactic
relation between morphemes. The work in this
section is to evaluate the quality of the word
information which is processed by each function
of the morphological analyzer. However, it is hard
to evaluate the accuracy of the morphological
analyzer automatically, so we compare the results
generated by the morphological analyzer with
results generated by human experts, which are
made out of their language intuition. The answers
agreed by the majority of the human experts are
assumed to be the right answers. The closer the
results of the morphological analyzer are to the
human experts, the more accurate the
morphological analyzer is.
The testing data is the set of unknown words
extracted from the recently collected text by the
system of Ma, Hsieh, Yang and Chen (2001).
There is total 4,566 unknown words in our testing
data. However, the validity of the morphological
information is still uncertain; therefore five
linguistic specialists have to manually verify the
morphological structure of unknown words by
filling out the survey. First, we randomly select
100 words as a testing set and the following three
questions are answered by these five specialists.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96872425">
1) What&apos;s the category of the unknown word?
2) What are the morpheme segmentations of
the testing words?
3) What is the syntactic tag of each morpheme?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.976235944444445">
The definition of our &amp;quot;standard answer&amp;quot; is the
answer the majority of the subjects give. For
example, if three out of the five subjects consider
the category of an unknown word X as VG, the
standard answer of X would be VG. If five
subjects think unknown word X belongs to five
different categories, we would ask one more
language specialist for opinions to determine the
category of this unknown word. The standard
answer we obtained from this survey will be the
standard answer of the morphological analyzer.
The morphological analyzer contains three
functions: to segment a word into morphemes, to
tag pos, and to identify the relation between
morphemes. The accuracy we mention here is the
result from comparing the morphological result
with the majority answer.

After comparing the result of the morphological
analyzer with the standard answers obtained from
the five linguists, we come to the conclusion that
the accuracy of the morphological analyzer is 81%.
Out of all the errors, 5% is caused by
segmentation on proper nouns and loanwords,
such as bilinshan ( a name of a mountain),
dingwan ( a name of a place), yanyou (
a name of a dynasty), maniuda ( a name of
a place), and hongburang ( home run).
These words cannot be segmented because they
only make sense when they are treated as a unit.
The remaining 14% is caused in the tagging
process produced by a morpheme table which
lacks in accuracy. For example, in some cases the
suffix zhou ( week) is supposed to be listed as
Nd but is instead listed as Nc. Next, there are no
proper categories for certain morphemes, such as
the morpheme lie ( to list as a verb, a row as a
noun) in the word qinglie ( ). In the suffix
table, the category of lie is only Na, but the
morpheme lie should have a VC category when
the meaning of qinglie &amp;quot;to list completely&amp;quot; is
adopted. Another possible error-causing factor
would be the choice made by following the
combination rule. When there is more than one
possible combination, errors might appear. For
example, there are two possible combination for
waizhan ( to stretch out), “Ng+Na” and
“Ng+VC”. Comparing the score of the two
combinations, the combination of “Ng+Na” is
chosen. However, it is not the correct category of
zhan ( to stretch).
The best way to resolve these problems mentioned
above is to revise the morpheme table more often.
Since the category of the suffix and prefix is fixed,
it might cause a reduction in morpheme ambiguity.
We are also interested in the similarity (or the
range of agreement with language intuition of
each individual) between those subjects. Since the
standard answers are the answer of the majority,
we can compare the standard answer with each
individual. The average rate of the similarity rate
is 89.2%. The ten-percentage puzzle might be due
to the ambiguity of the word and can be
interpreted that there are indeed some words that
are not only difficult for a machine to analyze but
also difficult for human beings to categorize.

The evaluation of the identification of the
morpho-syntactic relation is separated from the
evaluation of segmentation and tagging, because
the relation between morphemes is identified
based on previous information, such as the
category of a word, segmentation, and the pos.
Once the essential information is clear, the
morpho-syntactic relation is known. Nine out of a
hundred examples are marked by linguists as
errors of the morpho-syntactic identifier.
Furthermore, the reasons causing the error of
relation identification are 1) the category
predication’s error, 2) the part-of-speech error, and
3) the lack of the relation type. Firstly, since the
relation identifier is based on the result of the
segmentation and pos, it is understandable that the
error here is caused by previous functions. The
category of qipai-jia ([[ ] ] initial bidding
price) is Na, but the system predicts it as an
intransitive verb VA. So the identifier guesses the
relation between qipai and jia as “verb-object”
based on the previous information. The error of
the category prediction system might result in
errors of the relation identifier. Secondly, the
relation of qing-lie ( to clearly list) should be
“modifier-head”, but the identifier marks it as
“verb-object” relation because lie( ) is tagged as
Na. When the suffix is a Na, the prefix is a verb,
and since the category of qing-lie is predicted as a
verb, the identifier can only predict the relation of
qing-lie as “Verb-object”. Therefore, the error of
part-of-speech might cause the identifier errors.
Thirdly, the linguists suggest the relation between
morphemes in nian-song ( to read) is
“conjunction relation”. That means that both the
semantic meaning and syntactic function of nian
( to read) and song ( to read) are the same.
However, we don’t have the “conjunction
relation”, because we think the number of words
which belong to the kind of the relation is very
limited, and since both morphemes the bring same
information, there is no difference that enables us
to mark both of them as heads or only one of them
as a head for the application of predicating the
semantic and syntactic property of a word.
Therefore, in the morphological analyzer the
words which belong to the “conjunction” relation
are identified as “head-final” relations.

<bodyText confidence="0.999994964285714">
This is a pilot study to design a morphological
analyzer to analyze the morphological structures
of Chinese compound words automatically. The
major functions are 1) to segment a word into a
sequence of morphemes, 2) to tag the
part-of-speech of those morphemes, and 3) to
identify the morpho-syntactic relation between
morphemes. We evaluate the morphological
analyzer by comparing 5 linguists’ research results
and discuss the type of errors we find. The more
similar the results of the morphological analyzer
compared with the human results, the better the
morphological analyzer is. It is found that the
accuracy of our analyzer is 81%. In comparison
with the performance of human experts resulting
in an accuracy of 89%, the performance of the
current morphological analyzer is not bad, but still
has room for improvement. More, the types and
the identification of relations of morphemes still
have much room to be improved. It is also worth
noticing that the syntactic category prediction for
general compounds can also be improved by the
morphological analyzer. Once the internal
information of a compound is known, it can
provide clues for prediction of a word meaning
and its function. The prediction of a word’s
meaning is very hard and will be one of the main
themes in our future researches.

<abstract confidence="0.999332928571429">This is a pilot study which aims at the design of a Chinese morphological analyzer which is in state to predict the syntactic and semantic properties of nominal, verbal and adjectival compounds. Morphological structures of compound words contain the essential information of knowing their syntactic and semantic characteristics. In particular, morphological analysis is a primary step for predicting the syntactic and semantic categories of out-of-vocabulary (unknown) words. The designed Chinese morphological analyzer contains three major functions, 1) to segment a word into a sequence of morphemes, 2) to tag the part-of-speech of those morphemes, and 3) to identify the morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes. We propose a method of using associative strength among morphemes, morpho-syntactic patterns, and syntactic categories to solve the ambiguities of segmentation and part-of-speech. In our evaluation report, it is found that the accuracy of our analyzer is 81%. 5% errors are caused by the segmentation and 14% errors are due to part-of-speech. Once the internal information of a compound is known, it would be beneficial for the further researches of the prediction of a word meaning and its function.</abstract>

In the case that the syntactic category of the compound word is known, we will let P(Cat|compound) = 1 and the most probable part-of-speech combination will simply be the categorical rule Rulej such that P(Rulej|Cat) is maximized. 2.2.3 Morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes Once the information of segmentation and part-of-speech is ready, the morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes can be identified. According to Chao (1968) and Li&amp;Thompson (1981), there are relations between morphemes in compounds such as “modifier-hear”, “predicate object” and so on. The purpose of knowing morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes is to help decide the meaning of the target word. The morpho-syntactic relation between morphemes is grouped into the types listed in Table 5. Generally, the relation between morphemes is highly related to the category of an unknown word. So the relation we assign to morphemes must be based on the category of the word. When the unknown word is a noun, the relation between its morphemes is “modifier-</context>
