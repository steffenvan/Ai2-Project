This paper solves some puzzles in the for-
malisation of logic for discontinuity in cat-
egorial grammar. A `tuple&apos; operation intro-
duced in [Solias, 19921 is defined as a mode
of prosodic combination which has associ-
ated projection functions, and consequently
can support a property of unique prosodic
decomposability. Discontinuity operators
are defined model-theoretically by a resid-
nation scheme which is particularly am-
menable proof-theoretically. This enables
a formulation which both improves on the
logic for wrapping and infixing of [Moort-
gat, 1988] which is only partial, and resolves
some problems of determinacy of insertion
point in the application of these proposals
to in-situ binding phenomena. A discontin-
uous product is also defined by the residu-
ation scheme, enabling formulation of rules
of both use and proof for a `substring&apos; prod-
uct that would have been similarly doomed
to partial logic.
We show how the apparatus enables char-
acterisation of discontinous functors such
as particle verbs and phrasal idioms, and
binding phenomena such as quantifier rais-
ing and pied piping. We conclude by show-
ing how the apparatus enables a simple cat-
egorial analysis of (SVO) gapping using the
discontinuity product and the wrapping op-
erator.
The work by Glyn Morrill was for the most part car-
ried out under the support of the Ministerio de Edu-
cacion y Ciencia, Madrid, in the form of visting scholar-
ship grant SB90 P413308C.
In [Lambek, 19581 the suggestive recursive fractional
categorial notations of [Ajdukiewicz, 1935] and [Bar-
Hillel, 1953] were provided with a foundational set-
ting in mathematical logic. This takes the form of a
model theory interpreting category formulas in alge-
braic structures. A Gentzen style sequent proof the-
ory for which there is a Cut-elimination result means
that a decision procedure is provided on the basis of
sequent calculus.
The category formulas are freely generated from
atomic category formulas (e.g. N for referring nom-
inals, S for sentences, CN for common nouns, ... )
by binary operators \ (&apos;under&apos;), / (&apos;over&apos;) and •
(&apos;product&apos;). The interpretation is in semigroups,
i.e. algebras (L,-1-) where + is a binary operation
satisfying the associativity axiom si (82 83) =
(Si + 82) + 83. (In the non-associative formulation
of [Lambek, 1961), this condition is withdrawn.) We
may in particular consider the algebra obtained by
taking the set V* of strings over a vocabulary V;
then L is V* — {t} where t is the empty string. Each
category formula A is interpreted as a subset D(A) of
L. Given such a mapping for atomic category formu-
las it is extended to the compound category formulas
thus:

D(A\B) = {81Vs&apos; E D(A), s&apos; + $ E D(B)} (1)
D(B IA) = Is1Vs&apos; E D(A), s + E D(B)}
D(A0B) = {si + 821381 E D(A), 82 E D(B)}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999634166666667">
In general we may define L in terms of a semigroup
algebra (L5 ,-1-,t) where t E L is an identity element,
i.e. an element such that s + t =t+s = s; then
L is L5 — {t}. In the sequent calculus of [Lambek,
1958] a sequent is of the form A1, ,An A where
n &gt; 0,1 and is read as asserting that for any elements

si, • • • , sn in Ai, • • • ,An respectively, Si + + sn is
in A. Thus the relevant prosodic operations are en-
coded by the linear ordering of antecedents in the
sequent, and structural rules of permutation, con-
traction, and weakening are not valid. The calculus
is as follows. The notation r(A) represents an an-
tecedent containing a subpart A.

As is normal in sequent calculus, each operator has
a L(eft) rule of use and a R(ight) rule of proof. Cut-
free backward chaining proof search is terminating
since in every proof step going from conclusion to
premises, the total number of operator occurrences
is reduced by one.
The original development of categorial grammar
grew from semantic concerns, and as is well known,
the formalism embraces compositional type-logical
semantics. In particular, division categories A\B
and B I A can be seen as Fregean functors: incom-
plete Bs the meanings of which are abstracted over
A argument meanings. Complete (or: saturated) ex-
pressions bearing primary meanings belong to atomic
categories. Given some basic semantic domains (e.g.
truth values {0, 1}, a set of entities E, . . .) a hi-
erarchy of spaces for a type-logical semantics may
be generated by such operations as function forma-
tion (riT2: the set of all functions from 72 into TO
and pair formation (r1 x r2: the set of all ordered
pairs comprising a 71 followed by a 1-2). Each cat-
egory formula A is associated with a semantic do-
main T (A). Such a type map T for atomic category
formulas (e.g. T(N) = E ,T(S) = {0 ,1} ,T (CN) =
{0 , 1}E) is extended to compound category formulas
by T(A\B) = T(B I A) = T (B)T (A) and T (A. B) =
T (A) x T (B). Each category formula A is now inter-
preted as a set of two dimensional &apos;signs&apos;: a subset
D(A) of L x T (A). Such an interpretation for atomic
category formulas is extended to one for compound
A A to = A/A which as a theorem would assert that
the identity element I is a member of each category of
the form AI A (similarly for A\A). Since we have defined
categories to be interpreted as subsets of a set L which
does not necessarily contain an identity element, such a
theorem would not be valid, and it is prevented by defin-
ing sequents as having at least one antecedent formula.

Proofs can be annotated to associate typed semantic
lambda terms with each theorem [Moortgat, 1988].
A sequent has the form xi: Ai, , xn: An =4:A0
where n &gt; 0, no semantic variable is associated with
more than one category formula, and 0 is a typed
lambda term over (free) variables {x1, ..., xn}. It is
to be read as stating that the result of applying the
prosodic operation implicit in the ordering, and the
semantic operation represented explicitly by 0, to
the prosodic and semantic components of any signs
in A1, ..., An yields a sign in A. This system is un-
derstood as observing the type map in the obvious
way, and is an instance of the Curry-Howard corre-
spondence between (intuitionistic) proofs and typed
lambda terms. It was first employed in relation to
categorial grammar in [van Benthern, 1983]; for gen-
eralisation to other connectives see Morrill, 1990b;
Morrill, 1992a]

2 Prosodic Labelling
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997627333333333">
As we shall see, the implicit coding of prosodic op-
erations in the ordering of a sequent is not expres-
sive enough to represent the logic of discontinuity
connectives. In this connection, [Moortgat, 1991b]
employs [Gabbay, 19911 notion of labelled deductive
system (LDS). When we label for prosodics as well
as semantics, a sequent has the form al — xi: AI, ,
an x A = a — 4:A where n &gt; 0, no prosodic or
semantic variable is associated with more than one
category formula, a is a prosodic term over variables
{al, , an} and 0 is a typed lambda term over (free)
variables {xi, , xn}. The prosodically and seman-
2A general preparation for such multidimensional
characterisation is provided by [Oehrle, 1988] which ef-
fectively refines Montague&apos;s program in order to pro-
vide a more even-handed treatment of linguistic dimen-
sions. But note that Oehrle anticipates only functions as
prosodic and semantic objects. Here the prosodic alge-
bra is not made up of functions, and nor are functions
the only kind of semantic object. The symmetric treat-
ment of prosodics and semantics concurs with the con-
temporary trend for &apos;sign-based&apos; grammatical formalisms
such as HPSG [Pollard and Sag, 19921, though this latter
only goes so far as recursively defining a relation between
prosodic and semantic forms, i.e. representations. By in-
terpreting categories in the way set out in [Morrill, 1992a]
as pairings of prosodic and semantic objects we make di-
rect reference to their properties as defined in terms of
mathematical models, and use forms only in the meta-
theory.

We are free to manipulate labels according to
the equations they satisfy. In the case of asso-
ciative Lambek calculus there is the associativity
law; in the case of non-associative Lambek calcu-
lus there would be no equations on labels. Ob-
serve that with prosodic labelling, the structural
rules permutation, contraction, and weakening are
valid. In our labelling, we maintain the convention
that antecedent formulas are labelled with prosodic
and semantic variables. As a result each theo-
rem al — xi: Al, ..., an — xn: A = a — :A can be
read as a Montagovian rule of formation with input
categories A1, , An and output category A and
prosodic and semantic operations a and 0. Other
versions of labelling allow labelling antecedent for-
mulas with prosodic and semantic terms in general.
However such labelling constrains the value of the el-
ements to which the theorems apply by reference to
the terms that represent them. In relation to gram-
mar, this would mean conditioning rules on the se-
mantic and/or prosodic form of the input. For in-
stance, with respect to semantics, this would consti-
tute essential reference to semantic form in the way
which Montague grammar deliberately avoids. We
advocate exactly the same transparency in relation
&apos;In prosodic and semantic terms we allow omission of
parenthesis under associativity, and under a convention
that unary operators bind tighter than binary operators.

<bodyText confidence="0.999741772727273">
Elegant as such categorial grammar is, it is more
suggestive of an approach to computational linguis-
tic grammar formalism, than actually representa-
tive of such. Amongst the various enrichments that
have been proposed (see e.g. [van Benthem, 1989;
Morrill et al., 1990; Barry et al., 1991; Morrill, 1990a;
Morrill, 1990b; Moortgat and Morrill, 1991; Morrill,
1992a; Morrill, 1992b]), [Moortgat, 1988] advanced
earlier discussion of discontinuity in e.g. [Bach, 1981;
Bach, 19841 with a proposal for infixing and wrap-
ping operators. The operators not only provide scope
over these particular phenomena but also, as indi-
cated in e.g. [Moortgat, 1990], seem to provide an
underlying basis in terms of which operators for bind-
ing phenomena such as quantification and reflexivisa-
tion should be definable. The coverage of pied piping
in [Morrill, 1992b] would also be definable in terms
of these primitives, but all this depends on the reso-
lution of certain technical issues which have been to
date outstanding.
Amongst the examples we shall be able to treat by
means of our present proposals are the following.

In the particle-verb construction (8a) and discontin-
uous idiom (8b), the object `John&apos; infixes in discon-
tinuous expressions with unitary meanings. In (8c)
the quantifier must receive sentential semantic scope,
and in (8d) the pied piping must be generated, with
the semantics of `whom John works for&apos;. In (8e), the
semantics of the verb gapped in the second conjunct
must be recovered from the first conjunct.
Binary operators I and j are proposed in [Moort-
gat, 1988] such that BiA signifies functors that wrap
around their A arguments to form Bs, and B1A sig-
nifies functors that infix themselves in their A argu-
ments to form Bs. Assuming the semigroup algebra
of associative Lambek calculus, there are two possi-
bilities in each case, depending on whether we are
free to insert anywhere (universal), or whether the
relevant insertion points are fixed (existential). We
leave semantics aside for the moment.

This is the partial logic of [Moortgat, 1988]. Note
that the absence of a rule of use for existential wrap-
ping means that we could not generate from discon-
tinuous elements such as ring up and give the cold
shoulder which we should like to assign lexical cat-
egory (N \S)T3N. (Evidently Tv would permit incor-
rect word order such as *Wary gave the John cold
shoulder&apos;.) The problem with ordered sequents is
that the implicit encoding of prosodic operations is of
limited expressivity. Accordingly, [Moortgat, 1991b]
seeks to improve the situation by means of explicit
prosodic labelling. This does enable both rules for
e.g. lv but still does not enable the useful 13L: the
remaining problem is, as noted by [Versmissen, 1991],
that we need to have an insertion point somehow de-
terminate from the prosodic label for an existential
wrapper in order to perform a left inference.
In [Moortgat, 1991a] a discontinuity product is
proposed, again implicitly assuming just a semigroup

phrases seems almost definable as SI(SIN): they in-
fix themselves at N positions in Ss (and take seman-
tic scope at the S level — that is why they must be
quantified in). And if this definability could be main-
tained, it would enable these operators to simulate
the account of pied piping in [Morrill, 1992b]. None
of the interpretations above however enable the ex-
pression of the requirement that the positions re-
ferred to by the two operator occurrences are the
same. Our proposals will facilitate this definability,

The present innovation rests on extending the
prosodic algebra (Lt, +,t) as above to an algebra
(L* ,+,t,(., .),1, 2) where (., .) is a binary operation
of tuple formation (introduced in [Solias, 1992]), with
respect to which 1 and 2 behave as projection func-
tions. Thus the algebra satisfies the conditions:

We may in particular think of the algebra of elements
V* obtained from disjoint sets V and ; , 11 by clos-
ing V under two binary operations: concatenation
-F, and pairing [.; where pairing can be defined as
concatenation with delimitation and marking of in-
sertion point.
The proposal can be related to [Moortgat and
Morrill, 1991] which also considers algebras with
more than one adjunction operation (each either as-
sociative or non-associative), and defines divisions
and products with respect to each by residuation.
Note however that firstly, our tuple prosodic oper-
ation is not simply that of non-associative Lambek
calculus which is characterised by the absence of any
axiom (associative or otherwise), since the projec-
tion axioms entail specific conditions not imposed
in the non-associative case: we might describe the
tuple system as unassociative. Tupling is bijective
and a prosodic object s formed by tupling records
a separation point between two objects is and 2s
whereas a prosodic object formed by non-associative
adjunction has no such recoverable separation point.
Secondly, we are not primarily interested here in di-
visions and products based on tupling but in the
combined use of the associative and unassociative
operations to define discontinuity operators. (Note
however that residuation with respect to tupling, as
proposed in [Solias, 1992], would define operators
suitable for verbs regarded as head-wrappers such
as &apos;persuade&apos;.) This brings us to the essence of the
present proposals with respect to wrapping and infix-
ing. The prosodic interpretation for the discontinuity
operators is to be as follows:

It can be seen that the operators are the residuation
divisions with respect to a binary prosodic opera-
tion I defined by 81/82 = is + 82 + 2si just as the
Lambek operators are the residuation divisions with

the former distinction between existential and uni-
versal in (9) and (10). Because pairing is bijective
and tuples express a unique insertion point, there is
a unique decomposition of tupled elements. Exis-

As a first example of discontinuity consider the parti-
cle verb case &apos;Mary rang John up&apos; and the discontin-
uous idiom case &apos;Mary gave John the cold shoulder&apos;.
The meaning of the particle verb and the phrasal id-
iom resides with its elements together, which wrap
around their object. The lexical assignments re-
quired are:

A derivation is given in Figure 2. The lexical prosod-
ics and semantics of the proper names may be as-

6 Having the projection functions defined for all
prosodic objects rather then just tuple objects allows
us to consider the prosodic algebra to be untyped (or:
unsorted). Consequently, there is no need to check for
the data type of prosodic objects such as by pattern-
matching on antecedent terms (see comment above on
transparency of rules). It may be possible to develop the
present proposals by adding sort structure to the prosodic
algebra in a manner analogous to the typing of the seman-
tic algebra. Such sorting could be essential to defining
a model theory with respect to which the calculus can
be shown to be complete. Recursive nesting of infixation
points does not appear to be motivated linguistically, and
the present calculus does not support it. A sorted model
theory which excludes the recursion might provide an in-
terpretation with respect to which the present calculus is
both sound and complete.

6.2 Quantifier Raising
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99913484">
In Montague grammar quantifying-in is motivated
by the necessity to achieve sentential scope for
all quantifiers and quantifier-scope ambiguities.
Quantifying-in allows a quantifier phrase to ap-
ply as a semantic functor to its sentential context.
Quantifying-in at different sentence levels enables
a quantifier to take scope accordingly, and alterna-
tive orderings of quantifying-in enable quantifiers to
take different scopings relative to one another. In
[Moortgat, 19901 a binary operator 11. is defined for
which the rule of use is essentially quantifying-in, so
that a Montagovian treatment of quantifier-scoping
is achieved by assignment of a quantifier phrase like
&apos;something&apos; to NO, and assignment of determiners
like &apos;every&apos; to (NftS)/CN. In [Moortgat, 1991a] he
suggests that a category such as A ft. B might be de-
finable as BI(BIA), but notes that this definability
does not hold for his definitions, for which, further-
more, the logic is problematic. On the present formu-
lation however, these intuitions are realised. The cat-
egory SI(STN) is a suitable category for a quantifier
phrase such as &apos;everything&apos; or &apos;some man&apos;, achiev-
ing sentential quantifier scope, and quantificational
ambiguity.
Assume the lexical entry (22).

For &apos;John likes everything&apos; there is the derivation in
Figure 3. In this derivation, and in general, lines are
included showing explicit label manipulations under
equality in the prosodic algebra, in such a way that
all rule instances match the rule presentations. Sub-
stitution of the lexical prosodics and semantics as-
sociates John + likes + everything with (23) which
simplifies as shown.

In this example the quantifier is peripheral in the
sentence and a category (S/N)\S could have been
used in associative Lambek calculus. However, an-
other category SAN \S) would be needed to allow the
quantifier phrase to appear in subject position, and
further assignments still would be required for post-
verbal position in a ditransitive verb phrase, and
so on. Some generality can be achieved by assum-
ing second-order polymorphic categories (see [Emms,
1990]), but note that the single assignment we have
given allows appearance in all N positions without
further ado, and allows all the relative quantifier
scopings at S nodes.

As for the quantification, this example is potentially
manageable in just Lambek calculus. But an exam-
ple where the relative pronoun is not peripheral in
the pied piped material, such as &apos;a man a brother of
whom from Brazil appeared on television&apos; would be
problematic for the same reasons as quantification.
The solution, in terms of infixing and wrapping, is
the same in the two cases, but pied piping has been
a more conspicuous problem for categorial grammar
because while the scoping of quantifiers can be played
down, the syntactic realisation of pied piping is only
too evident. In the phrase structure tradition, pied
piping has been taken as strong motivation for fea-
ture percolation (see [Pollard, 1988]). We have seen
here how discontinuity operators challenge this con-
strual.
Categorial grammar is well-known to provide
possibilities for &apos;non-constituent&apos; coordination (see
[Steedman, 1985; Dowty, 1984) less accessible in the
phrase structure/feature percolation approach. We
turn now to another example which is glaringly prob-
lematic for all approaches, gapping. It is entirely
unclear how feature percolation could engage such a
construction; but as we shall see the discontinuity
apparatus succeeds in doing so.
The construction is characterised by the absence
in the right hand conjunct of a verbal element,
the understood semantics of which is provided by
a corresponding verbal element in the left hand
conjunct. Clearly, instanciations of a coordinator
category schema (X\X)/X will not generate such
cases of gapping. The phenomenon has attracted a
fair amount of attention in categorial grammar (e.g.
[Steedman, 1990; Raaijmakers, 1991]).
The approach of [Steedman, 1990] aims to reduce
gapping to constituent coordination; furthermore it
aims to do this using just the standard division op-
erators of categorial grammar. This involves special
treatment of both the right and the left conjunct. We
present our discussion in the context of the present
minimal example of gapping a transitive verb TV.
With respect to the right hand conjunct, the initial
problem is to give a categorisation at all. Steedman
does this by reference to a constituent formed by
the subject and object with the coordinator. This
constituent is essentially TV \ S but with a feature

both blocking ordinary application, and licensing co-
ordination with a left hand conjunct of the same
category. The blocking is necessary because &apos;and
Charles, phonetics&apos; is clearly not of category TV \S:
&apos;Studies and Charles, phonetics&apos; is not a sentence.
Now, with respect to the left hand conjunct, Steed-
man invokes a special decomposition of &apos;John stud-
ies logic&apos; analysed as S, into TV and TV \S. There
is then constituent coordination between TV \S and
TV \S. Finally the coordinate structure of category
TV \S combines with TV on the left to give S.
Although this treatment addresses the two prob-
lems that any account of gapping must solve, cate-
gorisation of the right hand conjunct and access of
the verbal semantics in the left hand conjunct, it at-
tempts to do so within a narrow conception of cate-
gorial grammar (only division operators) that neces-
siates invocation of distinctly contrived mechanisms.
We believe that the radical reconstruals of grammar
implicated by this analysis are not necessary given
the general framework including discontinuity oper-
ators we have set out. We address for the moment
just our minimal example.
Within the context of categorial grammar we have
established, the right hand conjunct is characteris-
able as SITV. It remains to access the understood
verbal semantics from the sentence that is the left
hand conjunct. In order to recover from the left
hand side the information we miss on the right hand
side, we would like to say that this information,
the category and semantics of the verb, is made
available to the coordinator when it combines with
the left conjunct. In accordance with the spirit of
Steedman, we can observe that the left hand con-
junct contains a part with the category SITV of the
right hand constituent, but it is discontinuous, be-
ing interpolated by TV. But this is precisely what
is expressed by the discontinuous product category
(STTV)0TV. Furthermore, an element of such a cat-
egory has as its semantics a pair the second pro-
jection of which is the semantics of the TV. Conse-
quently gapping is generated by assignment of &apos;and&apos;
to the category (((SITV)0TV)\S)/(SITV) with se-
mantics AxAyKirly 7r2y) A (x 71-20i•
The complete derivation for (27) is as in Figure 5,
where TV abbreviates (N\ S)/N. When we substitute
the lexical prosodics (here each just a prosodic con-
stant) for the prosodic variables in the conclusion,
we obtain the prosodic form (28).

Some generalisation to cover different categories
of gapped element and different categories of coor-
dination is given by straightforward schematisation.
In general, gapping coordinator categories have the
form ((Z 0 Y)\X)/Z where Z is XIY. In this
scheme, X is the category of the resulting coordinate
structure and Y is the category of the gapped mate-
rial. This allows interaction with other coordination
phenomena such as node raising. For example, a
referee pointed out that gapping can occur within
incomplete sentences thus: &apos;John gave a book and
Peter, a paper, to Mary&apos;. Such a case would be cov-
ered by the instanciation where Y is the ditransitive
verb category and X is S/PP.
For generalisation including multiple gapping (sev-
eral discontinuous segments elided) see [Solias, 1992],
which employs in addition operators formed by resid-
uation with respect to tupling. That approach has
certain affinities with [Oehrle, 1987], and makes it
possible to begin to address examples of Oehrle&apos;s re-
lating to scope and Boolean particles. The purpose
of the present paper has been to lay the groundwork
for empirical inquiry into gapping and other notori-
ous nonconcatenative phenomena, made possible in

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999373125">
When [Moortgat, 1988] introduced discontinuity op-
erators for categorial grammar, he noted that or-
dered sequent calculus was an inadequate medium
for the representation of a full logic. In [Moortgat,
1991b] the LDS formalism was invoked, but as we
have seen, the LDS format alone is not enough. The
present paper has argued that a different view is re-
quired on the model theory of discontinuity than that
suggested by interpretation in just a semigroup alge-
bra. This view is provided by adding to the algebra
of interpretation the tuple operation of [Solias, 1992].
Not only does this clear up some vagueness with re-
spect to existential and universal formulations, it also
admits of a full labelled logic. This has brought us to
a stage where it is appropriate to address such issues
as completeness and Cut-elimination.
