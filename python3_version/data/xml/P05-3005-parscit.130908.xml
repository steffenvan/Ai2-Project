Abstract: With the overwhelming amount of biological
knowledge stored in free text, natural language proc-
essing (NLP) has received much attention recently to
make the task of managing information recorded in
free text more feasible. One requirement for most
NLP systems is the ability to accurately recognize
biological entity terms in free text and the ability to
map these terms to corresponding records in data-
bases. Such task is called biological named entity
tagging. In this paper, we present a system that
automatically constructs a protein entity dictionary,
which contains gene or protein names associated with
UniProt identifiers using online resources. The system
can run periodically to always keep up-to-date with
these online resources. Using online resources that
were available on Dec. 25, 2004, we obtained
4,046,733 terms for 1,640,082 entities. The dictionary
can be accessed from the following website:

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947230769231">
With the use of computers in storing the explosive
amount of biological information, natural language
processing (NLP) approaches have been explored to
make the task of managing information recorded in
free text more feasible [1, 2]. One requirement for
NLP is the ability to accurately recognize terms that
represent biological entities in free text. Another re-
quirement is the ability to associate these terms with
corresponding biological entities (i.e., records in bio-
logical databases) in order to be used by other auto-
mated systems for literature mining. Such task is
called biological entity tagging. Biological entity
tagging is not a trivial task because of several charac-
teristics associated with biological entity names,
namely: synonymy (i.e., different terms refer to the
same entity), ambiguity (i.e., one term is associated
with different entities), and coverage (i.e., entity
terms or entities are not present in databases or
knowledge bases).
Methods for biological entity tagging can be catego-
rized into two types: one is to use a dictionary and a
mapping method [3-5], and the other is to markup
terms in the text according to contextual cues, spe-
cific verbs, or machine learning [6-10]. The per-
formance of biological entity tagging systems using
dictionaries depends on the coverage of the diction-
ary as well as mapping methods that can handle syn-
onymous or ambiguous terms. Strictly speaking,
tagging systems that do not use dictionaries are not
biological entity tagging but biological term tagging,
since tagged terms in text are not associated with
specific biological entities stored in databases. It re-
quires an additional step to map terms mentioned in
the text to records in biological databases in order to
be automatically integrated with other system or da-
tabases. Due to the dynamic nature associated with
the molecular biology domain, it is critical to have a
comprehensive biological entity dictionary that is
always up-to-date.
In this paper, we present a system that constructs a
large protein entity dictionary, BioThesaurus, using
online resources. Terms in the dictionary are then
curated based on high ambiguous terms to flag non-
sensical terms (e.g., Novel protein) and are also cu-
rated based on the semantic categories acquired from
the UMLS to flag descriptive terms that associate
with other semantic types other than gene or proteins
(e.g., terms that refer to species, cells or other small
molecules). In the following, we first provide back-
ground and related work on dictionary construction
using online resources. We then present our method
on constructing the dictionary.

UniProt [15]. Additionally, several model organism
databases or nomenclature databases were used. Cor-
respondences among records from these databases
are identified using the rich cross-reference informa-
tion provided by the iProClass database of PIR [14].
The following provides a brief description of each of
the database.
PIR Resources – There are three databases in PIR:
the Protein Sequence Database (PSD), iProClass, and
PIR-NREF. PSD database includes functionally an-
notated protein sequences. The iProClass database is
a central point for exploration of protein information,
which provides summary descriptions of protein fam-
ily, function and structure for all protein sequences
from PIR, Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL (now UniProt).
Additionally, it links to over 70 biological databases
in the world. The PIR-NREF database is a compre-
hensive database for sequence searching and protein
identification. It contains non-redundant protein se-
quences from PSD, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, RefSeq,
GenPept, and PDB.
UniProt – UniProt provides a central repository of
protein sequence and annotation created by joining
Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and PSD. There are three
knowledge components in UniProt: Swissprot,
TrEMBL, and UniRef. Swissprot contains manually-
annotated records with information extracted from
literature and curator-evaluated computational analy-
sis. TrEMBL consists of computationally analyzed
records that await full manual annotation. The Uni-
Prot Non-redundant Reference (UniRef) databases
combine closely related sequences into a single re-
cord where similar sequences are grouped together.
Three UniRef tables UniRef100, UniRef90 and Uni-
Ref50) are available for download: UniRef100 com-
bines identical sequences and sub-fragments into a
single UniRef entry; and UniRef90 and UniRef50 are
built by clustering UniRef100 sequences into clusters
based on the CD-HIT algorithm [16] such that each
cluster is composed of sequences that have at least
90% or 50% sequence similarity, respectively, to the
representative sequence.
NCBI resources – three data sources from NCBI
were used in this study: GenPept, RefSeq, and Entrez
GENE. GenPept entries are those translated from the
GenBanknucleotide sequence database. RefSeq is a
comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant set of se-
quences, including genomic DNA, transcript (RNA),
and protein products, for major research organisms.
Entrez GENE provides a unified query environment
for genes defined by sequence and/or in NCBI&apos;s Map
Viewer. It records gene names, symbols, and many

other attributes associated with genes and the prod-
ucts they encode.
The UMLS – the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS) has been developed and maintained by Na-
tional Library of Medicine (NLM) [17]. It contains
three knowledge sources: the Metathesaurus
(META), the SPECIALIST lexicon, and the Seman-
tic Network. The META provides a uniform, inte-
grated platform for over 60 biomedical vocabularies
and classifications, and group different names for the
same concept. The SPECIALIST lexicon contains
syntactic information for many terms, component
words, and English words, including verbs, which do
not appear in the META. The Semantic Network con-
tains information about the types or categories (e.g.,
“Disease or Syndrome”, “Virus”) to which all META
concepts have been assigned.
Other molecular biology databases - We also in-
cluded several model organism databases or nomen-
clature databases in the construction of the
dictionary, i.e., mouse - Mouse Genome Database
(MGD) [18], fly - FlyBase [19], yeast - Saccharomy-
ces Genome Database (SGD) [20], rat – Rat Genome
Database (RGD) [21], worm – WormBase [22], Hu-
man Nomenclature Database (HUGO) [23], Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [24], and
Enzyme Nomenclature Database (ECNUM) [25, 26].

of each resource. Annotations extracted from each
resource were then processed to extract terms where
each term is associated with one or more UniProt
unique identifiers and comprised the raw dictionary
for BioThesaurus. The raw dictionary was computa-
tionally curated using the UMLS to flag the UMLS
semantic types and remove several high frequent
nonsensical terms. There were a total of 1,677,162
iProclass records in the PIR release 59 (released on
Dec 25 2004). From it, we obtained 4,046,733 terms
for 1,640,082 entities. Note that about 27,000 records
have no terms in the dictionary mostly because they
are new sequences and have not been annotated and
linked to other resources or terms associated with
them are nonsensical. The dictionary can be searched
through the following URL:
http://biocreative.ifsm.umbc.edu/biothesaurus/Biothe
saurus.html.
Figure 2 shows a screenshot when retrieving entities
associated with term il2. It indicates that there are
totally 71 entities in UniProt that il2 represents when
ignoring textual variants. The first column of the ta-
ble is UniProt ID. The primary name is shown in the
second column, the family classifications available
from iProClass are shown in the following several
columns, the taxonomy information is shown in the
next. The popularity of the term (i.e., the number of
databases that contain the term or its variants) is
shown next. And the last column shows the links to
the records from which the system extracted the
terms.

Biological entity tagging is not a trivial task because of several characteristics associated with biological entity names, namely: synonymy (i.e., different terms refer to the same entity), ambiguity (i.e., one term is associated with different entities), and coverage (i.e., entity terms or entities are not present in databases or knowledge bases). Methods for biological entity tagging can be categorized into two types: one is to use a dictionary and a mapping method [3, 4, 5], and the other is to markup terms in the text according to contextual cues, specific verbs, or machine learning [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
