Syntactic coindexing restrictions are by now known to be of central importance to practical
anaphor resolution approaches. Since, in particular due to structural ambiguity, the assumption
of the availability of a unique syntactic reading proves to be unrealistic, robust anaphor resolution
relies on techniques to overcome this deficiency.
This paper describes the ROSANA approach, which generalizes the verification of coindexing
restrictions in order to make it applicable to the deficient syntactic descriptions that are provided
by a robust state-of-the-art parser. By a formal evaluation on two corpora that differ with respect
to text genre and domain, it is shown that ROSANA achieves high-quality robust coreference
resolution. Moreover, by an in-depth analysis, it is proven that the robust implementation of
syntactic disjoint reference is nearly optimal. The study reveals that, compared with approaches
that rely on shallow preprocessing, the largely nonheuristic disjoint reference algorithmization
opens up the possibility for a slight improvement. Furthermore, it is shown that more significant
gains are to be expected elsewhere, particularly from a text-genre-specific choice of preference
strategies.
The performance study of the ROSANA system crucially rests on an enhanced evaluation
methodology for coreference resolution systems, the development of which constitutes the second
major contribution of the paper. As a supplement to the model-theoretic scoring scheme that was
developed for the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) evaluations, additional evaluation
measures are defined that, on one hand, support the developer of anaphor resolution systems, and,
on the other hand, shed light on application aspects of pronoun interpretation.

1. Introduction

The interpretation of anaphoric expressions is known to be a difficult problem. In
principle, a variety of constraints and preference heuristics, including factors that rely
on semantic, pragmatic, and world knowledge, contribute to this task (Carbonell and
Brown 1988). Robust, operational approaches to anaphor resolution on unrestricted
discourse, however, are confined to strategies exploiting globally available evidence
like morphosyntactic, syntactic, and surface information.
Beginning with the pioneering work of Hobbs (1978), many practical approaches
rely on the availability of syntactic surface structure by employing coindexing re-
strictions, salience criteria, and parallelism heuristics (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994).
However, even the assumption of the availability of a unique syntactic description is
unrealistic since, in general, parsing involves the solution of difficult problems like at-

tachment ambiguities, role uncertainty, and the instantiation of empty categories. Based
on this observation, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) have suggested an adaptation of
Lappin and Leass&apos;s approach to the shallow analysis frontend of English Constraint
Grammar (Karlsson et al. 1995), which provides a part-of-speech tagging compris-
ing an assignment of syntactic function but no constituent structure. This information
deficiency is partly overcome by the application of a regular filter that heuristically
reconstructs parts of the constituent structure. An alternative solution, which is based
on the possibly partial but potentially more comprehensive and reliable output of a
conventional parser, has been suggested in Stuckardt (1997).
In the present paper, an approach to robust anaphor resolution is developed that
enhances the latter work. The coreference resolution algorithm ROSANA&apos; is devel-
oped, the core of which consists of a set of rule patterns by means of which the
verification of disjoint reference rules is generalized in order to make it applicable to
deficient (fragmentary) syntactic descriptions. Based on this algorithm, the ROSANA
system, which works on the partial syntactic descriptions generated by the robust
FDG (Functional Dependency Grammar of English) parser of Jarvinen and Tapanainen
(1997), is implemented. By a formal evaluation on two text corpora that differ with
respect to genre and domain, it is proven that ROSANA achieves robust (truly opera-
tional) high-quality coreference resolution on unrestricted texts. An in-depth analysis
shows that the robust implementation of syntactic disjoint reference is nearly opti-
mal. Compared with approaches that rely on a combination of shallow preprocess-
ing and heuristic syntactic disjoint reference, the largely nonheuristic disjoint refer-
ence algorithmization employed by ROSANA opens up the possibility for a slight
improvement.
The performance study of the ROSANA system crucially rests on an enhancement
of the evaluation methodology for coreference resolution systems, the development
of which constitutes the second major contribution of the paper. As a supplement to
the coreference class scoring scheme that was developed for the CO-task evaluation
of the Message Understanding Conferences (Vilain et al. 1996), two additional eval-
uation disciplines are defined that, on one hand, aim at supporting the developer of
anaphor resolution systems, and, on the other hand, shed light on application aspects of
pronoun interpretation. The evaluation of ROSANA according to the refined scoring
scheme gives evidence that the interpretation quality may be improved by a genre-
specific choice of the preference factors and their relative weights. This demonstrates
the usefulness of enhancing the evaluation methodology for coreference resolution
systems.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the robustness issue of natural
language processing is briefly discussed at a general level, and two models of robust
anaphor resolution are introduced. In Section 3, by deriving a set of disjoint refer-
ence rule patterns for fragmentary syntax, the core component of a robust, operational
anaphor resolution algorithm is developed. In Section 4, the ROSANA algorithm is
designed, and an implementation, the ROSANA system, is described. In Section 5,
an enhanced set of evaluation disciplines for coreference resolution systems is advo-
cated for, and the respective formal measures are defined. In Section 6, the evaluation
results of ROSANA are discussed. Finally, in section 7, ROSANA is compared with
other approaches to anaphor resolution and, in particular, robust syntactic disjoint
reference.

2. Anaphor Resolution and the Robustness Issue
2.1 Robustness in Natural Language Processing
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995401">
In natural language processing in general, the robustness issue comprises the ability of
a software system to cope with input that gives rise to deficient descriptions at some
descriptive layer.&apos; More or less implicit is the assumption that the system exhibits some
kind of monotonic behavior: the less deficient the description, the higher the quality of
the output (Menzel 1995).
Following Menzel further, this intuitive characterization may be refined. The pro-
cessing should exhibit autonomy in the sense that complete failures at one stage of
analysis should not cause complete failures at other stages of analysis or even a fail-
ure of the overall processing. Moreover, the processing model should ideally employ
some kind of interaction between different stages of analysis: deficiency at one stage
of analysis should be compensated by evidence gained at other stages.
2.2 Two Models of Robust Anaphor Resolution
In light of the above characterization, the robustness requirement for the anaphor
resolution task may be rendered more precisely. In the aforementioned operational
approaches, a sequential processing model is followed according to which anaphor resolu-
tion is performed by referring to the result of an already completed syntactic analysis. Un-
der this architecture, evidence for structural disambiguation that may be contributed
by strong expectations at the referential layer is not taken into account (Stuckardt
1996). In terms of the general goals of robust processing, since there is no interac-
tion, this implies that the robustness requirement only shows up in the form of the
monotonicity and autonomy demands: the anaphor resolution module has to cope
with deficient or shallow syntactic information. Besides the trivial way of achieving
this kind of robustness by simply not exploiting deficient syntactic descriptions, the
following two models may be employed:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8638335">
• the shallow description model: by employing heuristic rules to partially
reconstruct the syntactic description, the anaphor resolution strategies
are adapted to shallow input data that are never defective;3
• the deficient description model: by extending anaphor resolution
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.906438555555556">
strategies to work on a possibly ambiguous or incomplete description,
syntactic evidence is exploited as far as available.
In contrast to the approach of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), which follows the shallow
description model, the ROSANA algorithm is based on the deficient description model.
In principle, even a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; algorithm that establishes the conceptually superior
degree of robustness by means of interaction between structural disambiguation and
anaphor resolution is feasible (Stuckardt 1997). As will become evident, however, the
technically less complex sequential strategy employed by ROSANA already yields
high-quality results and does not leave much room for further improvement.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.99181125">
2 The deficiency may result either because the input itself is deficient or from shortcomings of the
processing resources (e.g., lexicon, grammar/parser, or semantic/pragmatic disambiguation).
3 Here, the monotonicity demand of intuitive robustness virtually vanishes, since there is no longer a
syntactic input prone to deficiency.

2.3 Fragmentary Syntax
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99646975">
The main phenomena that give rise to structural ambiguity of syntactic descriptions
are uncertainty of syntactic function (involving subject and direct object) and attachment
ambiguities of prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and adverbial clauses. In example
(1),

<listItem confidence="0.884642">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997754">
depending on the availability of disambiguating information, it may be uncertain
whether the underlined prepositional phrase with the telescope should be interpreted
adverbially or attributively. From the configurational perspective, these ambiguities
give rise to fragmentary syntactic descriptions that consist of several tree-shaped
components. With the exception of the topmost tree fragment, all components cor-
respond to a constituent of type PP. S. or NP whose attachment or role assignment
failed.
In addition, cases in which no reading exists give rise to fragmentary syntactic de-
scriptions comprising the constituents whose combination failed due to constraint
violation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999727">
2.4 Fragmentary Syntax and Anaphor Resolution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999821">
Among the anaphor resolution strategies potentially affected by fragmentary syntax
are both heuristics and constraints. Preference criteria like salience factors and syntactic
parallelism are not affected by all types of syntactic defects. Moreover, there are many
heuristics that do not rely on syntactic function or structure. Structural coindexing
constraints, however, may lose evidence in all the above cases of fragmentary syntax.
Since they are known to be of central importance to the antecedent-filtering phase of
operational anaphor resolution approaches, the subsequent discussion focuses on the
impact of deficient surface structure description on disjoint reference restrictions.
By referring to Chomsky&apos;s Government and Binding (GB) Theory, the core of the
syntactic coindexing restrictions may be stated as follows (Chomsky 1981):4

sense, arbitrary. In the subsequent discussion, the comprehensive and widely known GB Theory is
referred to.

Surface structure node X c-commands node Y if and only if the next branching node that

The following examples illustrate the scope of the binding principles:

c. *The client, wants that the barber] shaves the client,.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.960099666666666">
In sentence (2a), whereas the reflexive himself is required to be coindexed with the local
subject the barber (binding principle A), coindexing the pronoun him with the subject
is ruled out (binding principle B) because, otherwise, the pronoun would be locally
bound in its binding category. Sentence (2b) illustrates the case of nonlocal binding
(here: outside the embedded sentence), which is admissible only in the case of the
nonreflexive pronoun. As illustrated by sentence (2c) and modeled by binding princi-
ple C, referring expressions (e.g., common nouns and names) are not even allowed to
be bound nonlocally.
A further structural well-formedness condition, commonly called the i-within-
i condition, aims at ruling out certain instances of referential circularity, that is, coin-
dexings matching the pattern [a .. . [0 . ..],], (Chomsky 1981, page 212). It is motivated
by cases like (3):
(3) *Mary knows [the owner of his, boat].
The following example illustrates that syntactic fragmentation may interfere with the
application of syntactic disjoint reference conditions:

<listItem confidence="0.893966">
(4) Peter observed the owner of the telescope with it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971343333333333">
In (4), the i-within-i condition possibly applies:6 the coindexing of telescope and it is
admissible only if the PP containing it is not interpreted as an attribute to telescope—
otherwise, in violation of the i-within-i condition, the pronoun would be contained
in the NP of the tentative antecedent. Hence, if the PP attachment ambiguity has not
6 Since the (maximal projection of the) NP with head telescope dominates the NP of it, the former NP
does not c-command the latter. Hence, coindexing the two NPs does not induce a relation of (local)
binding, which implies that binding principle B does not apply in this case.
If one assumes the applicability of the i-within-i condition defined as above, however, there are two
classes of cases that do not seem to be appropriately distinguished:

(i) Peter observed the owner of [the telescope near its, factory],.
(ii) *Peter destroyed [a picture of its, frame],.

Whereas in (i), where the possessive occurs in an adjunct phrase of the telescope NP, coindexing may be
judged admissible, in (ii), where the possessive occurs in a complement phrase, coindexing seems to be
inadmissible. If, however, the scope of the i-within-i condition were restricted to the complement cases
(ii), then, since binding principle B does not apply, case (4) would remain unaccounted for. Whereas, in
theory, it is widely agreed that the original definition of the i-within-i condition may be somewhat too
strong (e.g., Chomsky 1981, page 212), with respect to the practical task of robust anaphor resolution,
as the formal evaluations below will demonstrate, the original i-within-i condition is sufficient. In
corpora, cases like (i) seem to be exceptional.

3. Checking Binding Constraints on Fragmentary Syntax
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99999">
3.1 Basic Observations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931111111111">
The first step toward the verification of binding constraints on fragmentary syntax is
suggested by the following observation: if both the anaphor and the antecedent candidate are
contained in the same connected component of the fragmentary syntactic description, no (direct)
binding-theoretic evidence is lost. In this case, it will be possible to verify the binding
restrictions of anaphor and antecedent in a nonheuristic manner, since the necessary
positive binding principle A) and negative (—&gt; binding principles B, C) syntactic-
configurational evidence is entirely available.&apos; However, even in the disadvantageous
case in which the anaphor and the antecedent candidate occur in different surface
structure fragments, a closer look at the fragments may reveal additional information.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999985">
3.2 An Example
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.934259571428571">
The following example illustrates a typical case:8
(5) Der Mann hat den Prasidenten besucht, der ihn von sich aberzeugte.
the man has the president visited who him of himself convinced
&apos;The man visited the president who convinced him of himself.&apos;
Because of the intervening past participle, the relative clause may be interpreted as an
attribute to either Mann or Priisidenten. Hence, syntactic ambiguity arises, yielding a
surface structure description that consists of the following two fragments:9
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.633288">
(S Mann
(VP Priisidenten))
(S der
(VP ihn
(VP (PP sich))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991381">
In addition, it is known that the second fragment is embedded in the first. There
are three pronominal anaphors to be resolved: the reflexive pronoun sich of binding-
theoretic type A, the nonreflexive pronoun ihn of type B, and the relative pronoun der
of type B.
Regarding the reflexive pronoun sich, it can be shown that binding-theoretic ev-
idence is completely available. Clearly, this holds with respect to the candidates der
and ihn, which are contained in the same surface structure fragment. However, even
regarding the two candidates Mann and Prasidenten that occur in the other fragment,
there is no loss of evidence: since the reflexive pronoun is of binding-theoretic type A,
and the fragment in which it occurs contains its binding category (the S node of the

7 However, this statement applies solely to the direct comparison of the involved occurrences, since in
case of further, transitive coindexings, negative evidence stemming from decision interdependency may
get lost (cf. Section 4.1).
8 The example is given in German because the structural ambiguity emerges more strikingly.
9 For the sake of readability, parts of the constituent structure are omitted.

relative clause), according to binding principle A both candidates may be definitively
ruled out.
Similar observations can be made regarding the pronouns ihn and der, for which
binding principle B applies: the two candidates Mann and Priisidenten are recognized
as configurationally admissible. In this case, besides the binding category condition, it
is decisive that their fragment is known to be embedded in the antecedent&apos;s fragments.&apos;
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99976">
3.3 Rule Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.901265">
In the subsequent discussion, pairs of anaphors a and antecedent candidates -y are
considered that occur in different surface syntactic fragments. The goal is to determine
whether coindexing a and -y (as in the case of actually choosing -y as the antecedent
of a) complies with the above-stated binding-theoretic conditions. Since, according to
the definition of the binding principles, no asymmetric distinction between anaphor
and candidate is drawn, the disjoint reference requirements of both a and -y must be
taken into account.
By an abstraction over cases like the ones discussed in Section 3.2, a set of rule pat-
terns can be designed by means of which the verification of syntactic disjoint reference
is generalized in order to make it applicable to fragmentary syntactic descriptions (cf.
Figure 1).11 As illustrated by example (5), there are two classes of patterns.12 One class
(five patterns, labeled &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;) matches cases in which, according to the binding princi-
ples, coindexing the anaphor a and the antecedent candidate -y is ruled out; the other
class (three patterns, labeled &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;) applies in certain cases where no binding principle
is violated and coindexing is therefore admissible. By the binding principles, conditions
regarding, on one hand, the presence or absence of a c-command relation, and, on the
other hand, the locality or nonlocality of this relation, are stated. The rule patterns are
designed to match fragmentary cases in which at least one condition of either anaphor
or candidate is violated (&amp;quot;*&amp;quot; patterns), or cases in which all conditions of anaphor and
candidate are satisfied (&amp;quot;V&amp;quot; patterns). Figure 2 explicates the specific conditions the
different patterns aim at. Three patterns apply in certain cases of binding principle A
violation ([E2]: missing locality; [ELI]: missing c-command relation; [F2]: either miss-
ing locality or missing c-command relation). Another two patterns cover instances of
binding principle C violation ([E3al, [E3b1: c-command relation). Three other patterns
match cases of binding principle B satisfaction ([Fl], [Ela], nonlocality).
This collection of rules may be supplemented with further patterns employing
more sophisticated conditions regarding the fragments to be matched.&apos; The actual
choice of rule patterns, however, should depend on the parser that is used. As will
10 It is evident that there are cases in which the latter condition does not hold and the coindexing would
violate binding principle C.
11 The following notational conventions are used: round brackets delimit constituents; square brackets
emphasize fragment boundaries; bc(X) denotes the binding category of surface structure node X; bn (X)
denotes the branching node dominating X according to the c-command definition; the subscript of
Xtype y denotes that the binding-theoretic class of the occurrence contributed by X is Y E {A, B, C}; for
example, Ptype B is a pronoun. \ //* indicate the prediction of the particular pattern, that is, whether, in
structural configurations matching the pattern, coindexing is admissible or ruled out.
12 Example (5) illustrates an instance of syntactic fragmentation that is due to structural ambiguity. The
rule patterns, however, are general in the sense that they also cover cases of fragmentary syntactic
description that are induced by parsing constraint violation (cf. Section 2.3).
13 For example, patterns may be added that match instances of binding principle B violation, that is, cases in
which one occurrence of type B is locally c-commanded by the other occurrence. To recognize such cases,
two conditions must be verified, one requiring that one occurrence c-command the other (of type B)
regardless of the attachment choice, the other requiring that the fragment of the latter occurrence not
contain the occurrence&apos;s binding category. Similar conditions may be employed for recognizing
instances of binding principle A satisfaction.

fragment ensures that, in case this fragment is subordinated under the candidate&apos;s
fragment, no relation of local binding holds; on the other hand, the condition that the
branching node be present in the candidate&apos;s fragment rules out, in the opposite case,
the possibility of establishing a c-command relation. [F21 is applicable in the case of
example (5). Since the relative clause contains a reflexive pronoun (taken as anaphor
a) and the respective binding category, it matches the fragment F]; similarly, the main
clause instantiates F, with respect to any of its type C occurrences (taken as candidates
-y). Hence, according to the prediction of [F21, the immediate, constructive&apos; coindexing
of the reflexive pronoun with any of the candidates occurring in the main clause is
ruled out.
For certain adjacent syntactic fragments, the parsing result may comprise addi-
tional information about immediate or transitive embedding. Based on this evidence,
further rule patterns may become applicable (Fd = dominating fragment, Fe = embed-
ded fragment):

are the (enhanced) counterparts of pattern [F1]. If the fragment of the type B anaphor
a is subordinated, coindexing with an outside candidate 7 (here: arbitrarily of type
A, B, or C) is admissible. If, on the other hand, the fragment of the type B (or type
C) anaphor a is known to be the dominator, a candidate -y of type B that occurs in
a fragment containing its binding category is configurationally permitted.&apos; Hence,
because of the additionally available embedding information, it is possible to relax
the demands on the dominating fragment, which is no longer required to contain
the binding category of the respective occurrence. Typical cases in which [Ela] and
[Elb] apply are instances of structurally ambiguous relative clauses. In example (5),
since the (embedded) relative clause fragment contains the binding category of the
nonreflexive (type B) pronoun occurrences (taken as anaphors a), fragment F, of rule
[Ela] is instantiated; moreover, trivially, the (dominating) main clause instantiates Fd
14 While binding principle A constructively demands the existence of at least one local binder, it does not
preclude further, possibly nonlocal coindexings (cf. the example in Section 4.1). In this sense, the
application of [F21 is confined to the constructive search for the antecedent required to fulfill binding
principle A.
15 In the case of [Elb], the anaphor (i.e., the occurrence to be constructively resolved) occurs in the
dominating fragment. Since 1, cannot be a local binder of a, the occurrence in the dominating fragment
is not allowed to be of type A (cf. the remarks on constructive coindexing in footnote 14). Hence, since
a and -y are not interchangeable, [Ela] and [Elbj look slightly different.

known to be subordinated, the restriction that the candidate&apos;s fragment contain the
respective branching node can be dropped; the presence of the reflexive pronoun&apos;s
binding category in the embedded fragment proves to be sufficient for ruling out
the candidate as the constructive antecedent required according to binding principle
A. Again, applied to example (5), [E2] rules out the constructive coindexing of the

deals with another generic case of binding principle A violation. If the type A pronoun
a occurs in the dominating fragment, and, in addition, the subordinated fragment con-
tains the branching node of a constructive candidate &apos;y of arbitrary binding-theoretic
type, this candidate can be ruled out since, in any possible case of structural recombi-
nation, -y will not c-command a; in particular, this implies that, as required by binding
principle A, -y does not (locally) bind a. Since the requirement on the constructive
candidate&apos;s fragment is weak, pattern [ELI] applies in virtually any case in which a
reflexive pronoun occurs in a dominating fragment.
In general, there may be more than one rule pattern applying to a certain configura-
tion.&apos; However, the set of patterns is consistent in the sense that, whenever this situa-
tion arises, the predictions of all applicable rules are identical.
There are two further rule patterns that match certain syntactic configurations in
which a coindexing would violate the i-within-i condition (cf. Figure 3). Both patterns
are abstractions over cases of fragment embedding in which the root of the dominating
fragment constitutes one of the relevant occurrences. Thus, the scope of the i-within-i
patterns is rather restricted. As an example, if there is a dominating NP fragment (con-
stituting an antecedent candidate -y) and a locally ambiguous PP fragment containing
an anaphor a, [&apos;Ea] rules out coindexing the anaphor&apos;s NP with the overall NP.

4.1 The ROSANA Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957590909091">
Figure 4 describes the ROSANA algorithm. By applying a set of restrictions (Step 1)
prior to a set of preferences (Step 2), this algorithm follows Carbonell and Brown&apos;s (1988)
fundamental strategy by means of which the candidate set is narrowed down as early
as possible. In Step 3, the actual selection of antecedents takes place. Among the strate-
gies to be applied are restrictions (e.g., morphosyntactic and lexical congruence, dis-
joint reference conditions) and a plethora of preference factors (subject/topicalization
salience, syntactic obliqueness, recency, cataphor penalty, parallelism [inertia of syn-
tactic function]). Since the goal is to design an anaphor resolution algorithm, the choice
is restricted to strategies that are operational.
With respect to syntactic disjoint reference, the central goal of robustness against
fragmentary syntax is achieved in Steps 1(b) and 3(b). As described above, if the
considered occurrences are situated in different syntactic fragments, the rule patterns
come into play; the actual set of patterns to be applied depends on whether or not
it is known that one of the fragments is embedded in the other. Patterns labeled &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;
are used to eliminate candidates (Steps 1(b)iv and 1(b)v). Patterns marked &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; are
used to definitively admit candidates (Step 1(b)vi), contrasting with heuristic admittance
(Step 1(b)vii), which entails a decrement of the plausibility score in Step 2(a).
One subtlety taken into account is interdependency between different antecedent
decisions (cf. Step 3). In particular, decision interdependency may arise because of the
transitivity of the coindexing relation. As illustrated by the following example, even
regarding in tersentential anaphora, antecedent decisions that individually comply with
the disjoint reference conditions may collectively induce a violation:

For each of the two pronouns, candidate Gropius is configurationally admissible. In
a formal sense, however, the binding principles state restrictions on (intrasentential)
index distributions rather than on single anaphor-candidate pairs in isolation: in the
example, binding principle B of the pronoun him is transitively violated. In explicitly
checking for the binding-theoretic admissibility of transitively induced coindexings,
the algorithm guards against such cases (Step 3(b)). However, care must be taken not to
apply the binding restriction for reflexives constructively in this test since, as illustrated
in the following example, besides demanding constructively one local binder, binding
principle A does not rule out further nonlocal coindexings:

(c) sort the anaphors a according to decreasing plausibility of their
respective best antecedent candidates.
3. Antecedent selection: Consider anaphors a in the order determined in Step 2(c).
Suggest antecedent candidates -yi(a) in the order determined in Step 2(b).

restriction is verified in the strong, constructive sense (Step 1(b)i), the candidate&apos;s
restriction is applied in its weak version (Step 1(b)ii). In the rule patterns for the

4.2 Implementation: The ROSANA System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937631578947">
Based on the algorithm described in Figure 4, the ROSANA anaphor resolution sys-
tem has been implemented (Stuckardt 2000). In primarily aiming at determining the
coreference classes of nonzero linguistic expressions that specify entities,&apos; the scope
of ROSANA corresponds to the coreference task of the Message Understanding Con-
ferences (cf. Hirschman 1998). ROSANA handles a broad range of entity-specifying
expressions—in particular, ordinary, possessive, reflexive/reciprocal, and relative pro-
nouns, definite NPs, and names. The ROSANA system has been implemented in Com-
mon Lisp. In an evaluation on a set of news agency press releases (cf. Section 6), the
runtime of the ROSANA system (without parser) was 165 tokens per second on a
Pentium PC.
The FDG parser for English developed by Jarvinen and Tapanainen (1997) has been
chosen as the syntactic preprocessor!&apos; In giving robustness and processing speed pri-
ority over normativity and syntactic coverage of the underlying grammar, the parser
meets the requirements on a preprocessor for robust anaphor resolution on unre-
stricted texts!&apos; Regardless of the typical parsing problems like structurally ambiguous
or grammatically incorrect input, the parser always yields a result, comprising one
or more syntactic fragments that cover the analyzed sentence. Hence, the parser is
regarded to be an ideal associate of robust anaphor resolution approaches that follow
the deficient description model.

4.3 Anaphoric Occurrences and Antecedent Candidates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.944161625">
In the ROSANA system, the above algorithm is supplemented by a set of strategies for
identifying occurrences (linguistic expressions that specify entities) and classifying them
as anaphors to be resolved and/or as possible antecedent candidates. The criterion for
the identification of specifying expressions is based on part of speech (as determined
by the FDG parser) and syntactic context (Stuckardt 2000, page 249).20 Also, the de-
cision of anaphoricity is based on evidence regarding the syntactic context: generally,
occurrences of all three binding-theoretic types (A, B, C) are taken to be anaphoric;&apos;
however, there are some classes of anaphoric occurrences that may, in certain cases,
be interpreted in advance (outside the ROSANA core algorithm) by purely structural
means (e.g., relative pronouns or occurrences induced by heads of appositions). For
narrowing down the search space, occurrences of type A (reflexive and reciprocal pro-

18 Since the parser generates dependency descriptions rather than constituent structure (to which the
formal definitions of the above GB-theoretic statement of syntactic disjoint reference refer), ROSANA
applies a preprocessor that reconstructs the structural (e.g., subject-object) asymmetries of constituency
that are vital to the verification of the disjoint reference conditions.

second on modest hardware (Pentium PC, 166 MHz).
20 Syntactic context plays a role, for example, in deciding whether the expression her is a possessive or
nonpossessive pronoun.
21 In the case of nonpronominal NPs, it proves to be difficult to decide algorithmically (e.g., based on
information about the determiner) whether or not a new discourse referent is introduced.

In Step 1(a) of the ROSANA algorithm, the details regarding the congruence restric-
tions are left unspecified. In the ROSANA system, depending on the specific type of
anaphoric expression, different morphosyntactic or lexical agreement conditions are
employed. For names, for example, a partial matching of the antecedent and anaphor
expressions (in the sense of surname identity) is considered sufficient. Regarding third
person pronouns (including possessives and reflexives/reciprocals), congruence of the
morphological features number and person is considered mandatory; however, congru-
ence of the gender attribute is taken to be optional, since, on one hand, there are some
well-known exceptions, and, on the other hand, the available grammatical gender in-
formation is not always correct.&apos; In any case, candidates that also match the gender
attribute of the anaphor are preferred.

4.5 Salience Factors and Weights
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881928571429">
As in the approaches of Lappin and Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996),
weighted salience factors are employed for scoring and choosing among the candi-
dates that remain after restriction application (cf. Step 2(a) of the ROSANA algorithm).
Since the goal is to develop an operational approach for unrestricted texts, the choice is
restricted to factors relying on information available in the scenario of knowledge-poor
processing, that is, without extensive semantic domain modeling.
In the ROSANA system, the following factors are employed: SYR (contributed
by occurrences with identical syntactic function), EEP (occurrences realized in the
syntactic position of existential emphasis), SUP (syntactic subject), PGP (possessive
pronouns, saxonian genitives, and genitive attributes), DOP/IOP/APP (salience of
direct/indirect objects and adverbial PPs, respectively), KAM (negative preference of
cataphoric resumptions), SDM (sentence recency; i.e., a factor of negative salience to
be multiplied with the sentence distance between anaphor and antecedent), WDM
(word recency). The main part of Table 1 indicates which subset of factors is used for
scoring the candidate set of which class of anaphoric expression (DNOM = definite
NP, PER{1,2,3} = first/second/third person pronouns, POS{1,2,3} = first/second/third
person possessives, RELA = relative pronouns, REFL = reflexive/reciprocal pronouns).
The assignment of the factors and the choice of the weights (shown in the lower
part of the table) have been determined by a series of refinement experiments on a
training corpus of 31 news agency press releases (11,808 words, 471 pronouns) for
which key data were provided manually. As a proper base for the goal-directed re-
finement of the factor assignments and weights, the interpretation results were scored
according to two of the formal evaluation disciplines that will be defined in Sec-
tion 5, namely, determination of coreference classes (model-theoretic scoring) and non-
pronominal anchors.&apos; The factor/weight relations determined by Lappin and Leass
(1994) for third person pronouns were taken as the initial clue. For the other types of
anaphoric expressions, sets of weighted factors were assigned based on an analysis of
the referential context of typical occurrences in the training corpus. For example, the

lexical information.
23 Since, for these disciplines, two-dimensional (precision/recall) measures are defined, there may, in
general, be multiple (pareto-)optimal factor/weight assignments. Instead, one may refer to a combined
(weighted) scoring scheme, such as the F measure employed in the MUC evaluations.

corpus study revealed that first person nonpossessive and possessive pronouns typi-
cally resume discourse referents instantiated by nearby antecedents that occur in the
syntactic subject role; consequently, the factors SUP, WDM, and KAM were chosen.&apos;
During a series of variation and evaluation runs in which some of the factors were
systematically deactivated, these initial assignments were empirically validated.&apos;
Finally, a series of experiments with the factor weights were carried out. Clearly,
the absolute size of the weights is irrelevant. However, some conditions that seem to
govern the relative size of the factor weights were determined/confirmed during the
training runs. For example, in locally varying the assigned weights in such a way that
individual &gt; relations of the syntactic function hierarchy SUP &gt; DOP &gt; TOP &gt; APP
were violated (e.g., by setting SUP = 10 &lt; DOP = 15), it was experimentally verified
that the original weight relations yield better results. Further findings are: SDM &gt;
SYR (syntactic parallelism induces local preferences only); SYR &gt; SUP (if an anaphor
occurs in a syntactic role other than subject, then candidates with that same role are
preferred to candidates in subject role); KAM large (cataphoric resumptions are heavily
penalized). For the most part, these results coincide with, or provide further support
for, similar findings by Lappin and Leass (1994, page 549).&amp;quot;
As table 1 makes evident, the salience factors proper (determined by syntactic role)
are employed only in the case of pronominal anaphors. Most importantly, there is a
striking difference between PER3 and POS3: whereas, in the former case, a hierarchy of
syntactic roles (i.e., salience factors with decreasing weights) is referred to, in the latter
case, only the factors of subject preference and syntactic parallelism are employed
because it turned out that possessive pronouns tend to cospecify with antecedents
that are either syntactic subjects or, again, possessive pronouns. Relative pronouns are
considered to be an exception: since, in most cases, they take their antecedents in the
nearest vicinity, the word recency factor proved to be sufficient.
24 Through this preference, cases are accounted for, too, in which appropriate third person antecedents
occur outside a passage of quoted speech containing the first person pronoun. In particular, this
renders possible the determination of nonpronominal anchors (cf. Section 5.3) for first person pronouns.
25 Whereas, in large part, the experiments confirmed the factor assignments for third person pronouns
suggested by Lappin and Leass, it turned out that the training corpus did not contain a sufficient
number of occurrences realized in the syntactic position of existential emphasis for evaluating the
contribution of the EEP factor. This should be addressed by further experiments on larger corpora.
26 One divergence regards the size of the syntactic parallelism factor SYR. According to the experimental
results, SYR should be larger than SUP. However, Lappin and Leass determined that SYR should be
just large enough to offset the preference for subjects over accusative objects, that is, SYR + DOP &gt;
SUP. This issue should be addressed by further experiments.

5.1 Model-Theoretic Coreference Scoring
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948363636364">
Vilain et al. (1996) developed the model-theoretic scoring scheme according to which
precision and recall values are computed by a formal alignment of the coreference
equivalence classes of system output and intellectually gathered key data. Basically,
precision errors correspond to nontrivial partitions of system-generated equivalence
classes induced by key equivalence classes, whereas recall errors correspond to non-
trivial partitions of key equivalence classes induced by system-generated equivalence
classes.
Formally, let R5 and Rk be the coreference relations computed by the anaphor
resolution system and specified by the key, respectively; moreover, let [Rs] and [Rk] be
the respective sets of equivalence classes. Furthermore, with Cs [Rs] and Ck E
let C5 n ok and Ck n Os be the equivalence classes (sets of occurrences) obtained by
restricting the original equivalence classes to the sets of occurrences Ok and OS over
which the relations Rk and R5, respectively, are defined;28 analogously, let (1,(C5,Rk) and
(I)(Ck, R5) be the equivalence relations that result by restricting the original relations Rk
and R5 to the occurrences contained in the equivalence classes Cs E [Rs] and Ck E
[Rk], respectively (cf. the discussion in Section 5.2.1).29 In addition, let [43(0, Rs)] and
[4)(C5, Rk)] be the sets of equivalence classes of the restricted relations. The precision
and recall measures are computed by summing over the sets of equivalence classes of
system response and key classes, respectively. For each class C, there is a maximum of
C n 01— 1 correct contributions; the actual number of errors, which equals the number
of equivalence classes I [1.(C, R)]I of the restricted relation minus 1, has to be deducted.

be solved by coreference resolution systems. One particular subtask that is usually

To ensure the expressiveness of the totality of evaluation measures, it is essential that
they be decoupled from each other in the sense that errors at one stage of processing
are exclusively reflected in the respective evaluation measure. Regarding the possible
effects of precision and recall errors of occurrence identification on model-theoretic
coreference scoring, this requirement is met by referring, in the definitions given in
Section 5.1, to the restricted classes Cs n Ok and Ck n Os, and to the restricted relations
.1(C5,Rk) and 43 (Ck , R5). Without this refinement of the model-theoretic measures, there
may be cases of scoring anomalies. If the cardinalities in the above definitions were
determined by referring to the original (unreduced) equivalence classes and relations,
each additional occurrence os e Cs\Ok or ok E Ck\Os would lead to an (incorrect)
increase in precision or recall, respectively, because, trivially, these sets of occurrences
are not partitioned by the relations Rk or Rs, respectively.

Hence, the evaluation measures defined so far are considered insufficient for an opti-

there is a need for fine-grained information that distinguishes between different classes
of anaphoric expressions.
As will become evident during evaluation of the ROSANA system in Section 6,
another reason for differentiating between types of anaphoric expressions is the lack of
expressiveness of model-theoretic scoring regarding the interpretation quality achieved
for pronouns (i.e., for the class of anaphors that is, from the perspective of typical
applications, of central importance).

5.3 Scoring from an Application&apos;s Point of View: Nonpronominal Anchors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979207">
Regarding the requirements of typical applications,&apos; the task of pronoun interpreta-
tion may be defined as determining a suitable nonpronominal substitute, that is, a
non pronominal antecedent rather than an arbitrary cospecifying antecedent that again
might be a pronoun.

According to model-theoretic coreference scoring, no distinction is made between
pronominal and nonpronominal antecedents: what is relevant are the sizes of the
matching fractions of equivalence classes rather than the presence of correct non-
pronominal anchors suitable as substitute expressions. There are at least two reasons
why the task of identifying correct nonpronominal substitutes is considerably harder
than the task of finding an arbitrary correct antecedent. First, there is focus-theoretic
evidence: typically, entities specified by pronouns are in focus&apos; and, hence, most prob-
ably the antecedents of subsequent pronouns, which tend to resume the currently
focused entity.&apos; Second, a technical argument applies: the cospecification relation be-
tween a pronominal anaphor and a nonpronominal representative is algorithmically
determined by a nonempty chain of antecedent decisions that may, in general, be long:
Gropius he 4-P- he him 4 him
Whereas the hypothetical single error (indicated by &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;) implies incorrect nortprono-
minal anchors for all pronouns, according to the model-theoretic measure the precision
amounts to 0.75. Consequently, the evaluation scheme defined so far should be sup-
plemented by a measure that is expressive with respect to the application-relevant task
of identifying nonpronominal anchors.
To derive a suitable formal evaluation measure, one may start with the observation
that the relevant linguistic entities to be resolved are pronominal occurrences P for
which nonpronominal anchor occurrences A have to be identified. Basically, an anchor
A shall be considered a correct substitute for P if and only if A and P belong to the
same equivalence class of the key coreference relation. From a theoretical point of
view, this definition must be considered simplistic given the well-known examples of
opaque (intensional) contexts in which the substitution of coreferring expressions is not
a truth-preserving operation. These cases, however, are rare and do not seem to play
a role in typical application scenarios of pronoun interpretation algorithms.&apos; Hence,
the simple definition will be employed, which, in addition, entails the advantage that
the key data provided for model-theoretic coreference scoring suffices for the scoring
of nonpronominal substitutes.
Let (P. A) be a pair consisting of a pronominal occurrence P and the anchor oc-
currence A determined by the anaphor resolution system. (If, for P. no substitute has
been determined, then A is considered empty.) A suitable base for scoring is obtained
by classifying the pairs (P. A) according to the scheme described in Table 2, by which
a total of seven pairwise disjoint sets is defined. The classification depends on (1)
whether P and/or A are tagged, in the key, as valid (entity-specifying) occurrences,
(2) whether A is nonempty, and (3) whether, in case A is nonempty and both A and
L are valid occurrences, A and L cospecify in the key. According to the above defini-
tion, only the pairs fulfilling condition (3) (which, hence, constitute the set o++) are
considered to be correct solutions.
31 Care should be taken not to confound two different notions of focus here. In terms of the classical
topic-focus distinction, one would say that pronouns tend to specifiy entities constituting the topic.
32 Compare, for example, the predictions of the centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).
33 There is another argument that supports the choice of the simple definition. Probably the best
algorithmic strategy for determining correct anchors is the selection of the first nonpronominal
cospecifying occurrence that topologically precedes the pronoun to be resolved (cf. the above decision
chain argument). If, however, the distance between the determined substitute and the pronoun is small,
from the point of view of conversational pragmatics it is implausible that the intension of the
substitute occurrence does not match the (possibly opaque) context, since, otherwise, human readers
are expected to be misled as well (Stuckardt 2000, page 240).

Again, the requirement of mutually decoupling the evaluation measures should be
fulfilled. Regarding the errors made during the identification of specifying occurrences,
this goal may be met by basing the measures on the sets o++, 4_, 4?, 4_, and 4„
that constitute the cases in which the base entity to be decided upon, namely, the
pronoun occurrence P, has been determined in compliance with the key. By further
drawing the usual distinction between precision and recall, according to which, in
the latter case, one must take into account empty anchors A as well, one obtains the
following definitions:34

<bodyText confidence="0.97725928">
Since errors in the occurrence identification are excluded from measurement at this
stage of evaluation, and, moreover, it is assumed that there are no errors regarding
the classification of occurrences as decision-relevant entities (i.e., pronouns),&apos; it follows
that, in any case, P &gt; R. However, the characteristic trade-off relation between preci-
sion and recall holds anyway. If the assignment of nonpronominal anchors is confined
to highly plausible decisions, whereas the set 4_ will be larger, the sets 4_, 4?, and,
expectedly to a lesser extent, o++ will be smaller, thus typically yielding higher preci-
sion and lower recall. Vice versa, if more decisions are performed, 4_ will decrease in
size, but 4_, 4?, and, expectedly to a lesser extent, o++ will be larger, thus tending
to higher recall and lower precision. The special case P =- R holds if the set 4_ is
empty, that is, if there are no open decisions.&apos;
34 In generalizing the handling of optional coreferences (as originally specified in the coreference task
definition [Hirschman 19981 with respect to model-theoretic scoring), unresolved pronouns whose
antecedent link is marked as optional in the key (i.e., the elements of the set o+.) are not taken into
account in the recall measure of the nonpronominal anchor discipline.
35 The latter simplification is unproblematic because, under the condition that an expression is a valid
occurrence, the decision whether it represents a pronoun is trivial.
36 The one-dimensional accuracy measure that is typically employed in the evaluation of pronoun
resolution algorithms (for example, Lappin and Leass [1994] or Kennedy and Boguraev [1996])
implicitly relies on the fact that all pronouns are resolved. Under this condition, distinguishing between
precision and recall becomes unnecessary. Hence, the definition of the two-dimensional measure
(Pna, Rna) must be considered a generalization of the conventional accuracy measure. Employing the
refined precision/recall distinction even in the case of the arbitrary antecedent discipline may be
appropriate when evaluating anaphor resolution systems that aim at achieving high precision by
leaving some of the decisions open.

The upper part of Figure 5 displays the score on the discipline of identifying entity-
specifying occurrences (cf. Section 5.2.1): this subproblem is solved by ROSANA with
a (P„, R„) performance of (0.94,0.96). Regarding the precision errors, a closer look re-
veals that approximately 50% of the 243 overgenerated occurrences can immediately
be traced back to errors during morphological and syntactic analysis (in particular,
there were a number of cases in which adjectives were wrongly classified as nouns,
or in which the parsing of a compound NP failed); another 40% are failures of the
ROSANA occurrence identification algorithm proper. Regarding recall, fewer than 20%
of the missing 150 occurrences are due to errors of the ROSANA occurrence identifi-
cation algorithm.
With respect to the identification of pronouns, the performance of (0.94,0.996) is
considerably higher. In this important case, precision errors that were caused by mis-
categorization of nonreferential occurrences of the expressions it and that are the main
problem. An improvement of approximately 50% may be gained by refining the syn-
tactic analysis, which, at present, fails in certain cases (e.g.) to recognize nonreferential
occurrences of it as formal subjects.

According to the model-theoretic coreference scoring scheme defined in Section 5.1,
the (P„, R„) performance of ROSANA is (0.81,0.68) (Figure 5, coreference classes).
A closer analysis of the correctness of the immediate antecedents makes evident that
the actual interpretation quality varies heavily with respect to the type of anaphoric
expression.&apos; Whereas the precision regarding the antecedent choices for names
amounts to 0.94, the performance for the important classes of third person pronouns
and possessives is considerably lower (0.71 and 0.76, respectively).&amp;quot; Furthermore, as
expected, the precision for reflexive/reciprocal pronouns is optimal (1.0) since binding
principle A yields tight syntactic bounds that delimit the space of possible antecedents.
Regarding definite NPs, the interpretation quality is considerably lower (0.7) because,
at present, ROSANA relies on a simple test for lexical recurrence and number agree-
ment and does not employ enhanced techniques for the interpretation of nonpronom-
inal anaphora.4° Finally, the precision for first and second person pronouns is quite

computed. Reference data have been provided by an intellectual annotation of the press release corpus
according to the MUC-7 coreference task definition (Hirschman 1998).
38 Regarding the anaphor type abbreviations employed in Figure 5, see Section 4.5.
39 The figures regarding the correctness of immediate arbitrary antecedents have been determined
according to the precision measure that was originally developed for scoring non pronominal anchors.
Since, at least for the most common types of third person pronouns (PER3, POS3), immediate
antecedents are determined in virtually any case, the recall figures are almost identical (cf. the
discussion in Section 5.3). The precision measure coincides with the accuracy measure employed by, for
example, Lappin and Leass (1994) or Kennedy and Boguraev (1996).

to the person congruence condition. Regarding pronouns, a closer analysis shows that
approximately 30% of precision errors are due to the assignment of incorrect gender
attributes during morphological analysis and occurrence identification, and, hence,
may be eliminated if additional lexical information becomes available. Another 30%
of errors are induced by cases that are beyond the horizon of the heuristic salience-
based antecedent ranking in the sense that a theoretically adequate solution would

Regarding the task of identifying nonpronominal anchors, the results fall considerably
below the figures determined above for the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent case.
According to the (13„„,, Rna) measures defined in Section 5.3, the average precision is
reduced to 0.70 (compared with 0.76); regarding third person pronouns and posses-
sives, the precision decreases to 0.68 (0.71) and 0.66 (0.76), respectively.
The striking difference with the results of model-theoretic and immediate (arbi-
trary) antecedent scoring confirms the arguments put forward in Section 5.3 according
to which the determination of nonpronominal anchors is considerably harder: whereas,
for 306 pronouns, correct immediate (arbitrary) antecedents as well as nonpronomi-
nal anchors were determined, there are another 21 cases in which only the former
choice proved to be correct (cf. the chain argument). Furthermore, the focus-theoretic
argument is supported: out of the selected antecedents of type pronoun, 85.6% were
correct, whereas, out of the selected antecedents of type definite NP /name, only 71.3%
were correct. Hence, as a proper base for obtaining results that are expressive with re-
spect to the pronoun substitution task, the model-theoretic coreference scoring scheme
should be supplemented with the described additional measures.

Since the assignment of the salience factors and their weights has been heuristically
optimized on a training corpus of news agency press releases (cf. Section 4.5), the
question arises whether, on one hand, these settings are still optimal on the evaluation
set of press releases, and, on the other hand, they are optimal on other corpora drawn
from different genres and domains as well. Five experiments were conducted to ad-
dress these topics. The second evaluation corpus consisted of three texts describing the
plots of Mozart operas. These texts, which comprise 2,522 words and 236 pronouns,
were considered suitable since they differ considerably from the press releases in text

41 Regarding the coreference class task, one must keep in mind that even the interannotator agreement
that was measured during key construction in MUC-6 amounts only to 81%. Clearly, human
performance with respect to the annotation of reference corpora, which, to a large extent, depends on
the complexity of the task definition, imposes an upper bound on the system performance that is, in
principle, measurable.

the original assignment of salience factors and weights. Moreover, some interesting
observations concerning the relative contributions of the factors can be made. The
algorithmically trivial preference criterion of sentence recency proved to be the most
valuable factor (Experiment (4)).44 In the case of the press release corpus and regarding
the PER3 measure, a relation of mutual substitution seems to hold between the factors
of syntactic parallelism and subject salience/syntactic role hierarchy: whereas deacti-
vation of either strategy results in a moderate performance reduction (Experiments (1)
and (2), respectively), deactivation of both strategies induces considerable deterioration
(Experiment (3)). These findings are in line with the results of Lappin and Leass (1994),

substitution between two important classes of syntactic preference factors, the above
results allow for a more precise rendering of this statement.
Closer investigation of the results on the Mozart operas corpus reveals that the
factor assignment only partly generalizes. The result deterioration induced by deac-
tivation of sentence recency (Experiment (4)) is even larger, a finding that may be
explained by a characteristic property of the cohesion structure of opera plot texts,
namely, the rapid shifts of the local foci from scene to scene, which contrasts sharply
with the typically steady focus in the press release texts. If the sentence recency factor is
switched off, this implies that the remaining focus-approximating salience factors (syn-
tactic parallelism, subject salience, hierarchy of syntactic function) may lead to wrong
decisions since the local foci of past scenes, which in the meantime have moved out
of focus, would receive the same salience.
A similar observation of cohesion structure dependency may be made regarding
syntactic parallelism in the POS3 strategy. Whereas, with respect to the press release
corpus, the positive contribution of this factor is confirmed, for the Mozart opera
texts, a negative contribution was measured: the deactivation in Experiment (1) yields
a gain of 3%. Closer analysis of the documents reveals that local contexts contributing
multiple POS3 occurrences with different reference are typical for this text genre:
(9) On a dark night in Seville, Leporello is keeping watch, grumbling,
outside a house in which his master Don Giovanni is engaged in his
latest amorous pursuit.
Again, the findings of the factor assignment experiments permit elaboration on a
conjecture by Lappin and Leass (1994, page 552), according to which considerable
improvement should be achieved by employing, for an optimization of the factor
assignments, statistical analyses of patterns of pronominal anaphora in corpora. More
precisely, the above results indicate that the text genre is reflected in some formal
properties of the cohesion structure that are important clues for the choice of factors.
In other words, the experiments indicate that salience factors and weights should be
assigned in a genre-specific way.&apos; From a practical point of view, these results are
highly relevant since, meanwhile, various referentially annotated corpora of different
genres (particularly the key data provided in formal evaluations) have been made
available.

In the previous sections, a robust approach to anaphor interpretation has been devel-
oped that follows the deficient description model. Based on a set of disjoint reference
rule patterns for fragmentary syntax, the ROSANA system accomplishes coreference
resolution with high precision and recall in various evaluation disciplines. The eval-
uation was carried out according to an enhanced set of scoring measures that sheds
light on aspects of development as well as application. The different arguments put
forward for an enhancement of the evaluation methodology for coreference resolution
systems have been confirmed. In particular, the evaluation results have proven the
nonadverbial/matrix and head emphasis, hierarchy of syntactic roles, and cataphora penalty. Whereas,
during individual deactivation of these factors, they observed comparatively small deteriorations of
less than 4%, the combined deactivation led to a reduction of more than 25% (Lappin and Leass 1994,
page 552).
46 In searching for additional evidence, further tests on corpora of other text genres should be carried out.

lack of sensitivity of the original model-theoretic coreference scoring scheme with re-
spect to salience strategy variation as well as pronoun interpretation quality. Moreover,
the figures confirm that, regarding pronouns, determining nonpronominal anchors is
more difficult than computing arbitrary cospecifying antecedents: on average, results
in the former discipline are 5.5% (press releases)/5°/0 (Mozart operas corpus) below
the results in the latter discipline.
As a proper basis for comparing ROSANA with the approaches of Lappin and
Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), one must focus on the evaluation re-
sults for third person pronouns in the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent discipline (as
discussed in Section 6.2). For third person pronouns (comprising nonpossessives, pos-
sessives, reflexives/reciprocals, and relative pronouns), ROSANA determined cospeci-
fying antecedents with a precision of rf = 0.75 (press releases) and 11 = 0.79 (Mozart
operas corpus). At first sight, the gap between these figures and the precision of 0.86
that was determined for the (nonrobust) approach of Lappin and Leass is still con-
siderable, a difference that may be partly attributed to the more difficult conditions
of robust processing, and partly to the (presumably well-behaved) characteristics of
the text corpus employed by Lappin and Leass (computer manuals). The standard of
comparison, however, is the robust approach of Kennedy and Boguraev, which follows
the shallow description model and which achieves an average precision of 0.75 on a
broad set of texts taken from different genres and domains. In the case of ROSANA, a
precision of 0.75 is achieved on the corpus of press releases, which exhibits the typical
properties of mass texts (e.g., a comparatively high rate of orthographic and syntac-
tic errors) and, hence, presumably imposes high demands on robust processing. On
the Mozart operas corpus, which, in this sense, is easier, the scores are considerably
higher. However, since different evaluation corpora have been used, and, moreover,
since the precision figure mentioned in the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) is
not qualified with respect to text genre, a direct comparison of the empirical results
should be based on further investigations.&apos;
As an alternative way of comparing the two approaches, their performance with
respect to the robust algorithmization of anaphor resolution strategies that rely on syn-
tactic evidence (in particular, syntactic disjoint reference) may be evaluated in detail.
Regarding the scope of robust processing of ROSANA according to the deficient de-
scription model, a qualification of the typical failures gives evidence that, with respect
to the fragmentary descriptions generated by the chosen parser, the robust imple-
mentation of syntactic disjoint reference is nearly optimal. None of the 7 incorrect
antecedent choices that are due to failures of the disjoint reference strategy (out of a
total of 246 wrong antecedent choices for the evaluation corpus of press releases) are
due to wrong predictions of the (still partly heuristic) algorithmization of the binding-
theoretic restrictions; rather, they are caused by wrong (in contrast to fragmentary,
i.e., partial) parsing results: while already employing defensive parsing strategies, the
parser still overgenerates in certain cases. In 6 of the 7 disjoint reference failures, a con-
figurationally admissible candidate has been erroneously eliminated; in the remaining
case, a configurationally forbidden candidate has been erroneously approved. Hence,
there is a tendency toward overgenerating disjoint reference restrictions. A detailed
47 This might be achieved either by employing the corpus used by Kennedy and Boguraev, which was
not available at the time ROSANA was evaluated, or by running Kennedy and Boguraev&apos;s algorithm (a
reimplementation of which requires, in particular, a formal description of the regular filter employed
by Kennedy and Boguraev to partially infer constituency) on the news agency press releases and
Mozart operas corpora.

analysis reveals that, in 4 of the 6 cases, the respective parsing error consists in a
wrong interpretation of a structurally ambiguous relative clause. This gives evidence
that, while the rate of disjoint reference failure is already very low (2.8% of all failures),
a slight improvement may be achieved by employing a more defensive parsing strat-
egy with a slightly higher level of syntactic fragmentation, which, by now, amounts
to an average of 2.61 fragments per sentence.&apos;
These findings may be compared with the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996),
which report 2 cases of pronoun misinterpretation (out of a total of 75 failures) that
are due to a failure to establish configurationally determined disjoint reference, and
several additional cases in which a wrong antecedent was chosen because of a wrong
heuristic assignment of syntactic salience factors. Hence, with respect to syntactic dis-
joint reference, the failure rate of the shallow description approach (2.7% of all failures)
of Kennedy and Boguraev is of the same order of magnitude as that of the deficient de-
scription approach followed by ROSANA (2.8%). As the above analysis has revealed,
however, in the case of ROSANA, the disjoint reference errors are not induced by
failures of the heuristic algorithmization of the disjoint reference conditions; instead,
they can be traced back to wrong decisions made during parsing, thus leaving some
room for improvement by fine-tuning the rule pattern set and parsing strategy. This
opens up the possibility of a further refinement, which is the immediate consequence
of the conceptually transparent way of implementing robust disjoint reference by fol-
lowing the deficient description model. Regarding the syntactic preference strategies,
ROSANA scores well, too: only 3 wrong antecedent decisions (1.2% of all failures) are
due to errors in the assignment of syntactic salience factors.
Since the difference in interpretation quality can be expected to be small, the de-
cision whether to follow the shallow description approach or the deficient description
approach may be based on practical considerations. Whereas the former approach
imposes lesser demands on preprocessing resources and implementation, the latter
approach may yield slightly better results. If one considers implementation and fine-
tuning of the deficient description algorithm relative to a particular parser as a once-
and-for-all effort, and, moreover, takes into account the further benefits of having
partial syntactic analyses available during anaphor resolution,&apos; the deficient descrip-
tion approach may be the method of choice for robust anaphor resolution. Depending
on the parser that is used and the characteristics of the texts to be interpreted, which,
in large part, determine number and type of failures of robust syntactic disjoint ref-
erence, it may, in certain cases, be reasonable to apply a hybrid strategy that aims at
avoiding, as far as possible, heuristic decisions: if the syntactic analysis yields suf-
ficient evidence, deficient descriptions are employed; otherwise, shallow description
rules are used.&apos;
48 As emphasized in Section 3.3, since, in general, the choice of rule patterns for robust disjoint reference
should depend on the parser that is used, an increase in the degree of parse fragmentation may give
rise to extending the set of patterns. The general question of optimizing the choice of rule patterns,
relative to a given parser, is an important issue that deserves further attention.
49 For example, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) mention the problem of interpreting quoted speech
separately from its surrounding context, a complex problem whose solution should be facilitated if
richer syntactic information is available. In fact, ROSANA already employs several successful heuristics
for interpreting anaphors in quoted speech, such as the handling of first person pronouns that occur in
the subject position of a quoted sentence.

50 Since the number of disjoint reference failures is already low, the potential benefits of employing a
hybrid strategy are limited. Whether there may be an additional contribution depends heavily on the
degree to which the two strategies of robust syntactic disjoint reference differ with respect to their
failure cases, which should thus be analyzed by an in-depth evaluation on large corpora.

Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithm
Whereas the robust algorithmization of syntactic disjoint reference has thus been
achieved in a nearly optimal way, with respect to the overall set of anaphor resolution
strategies, there is considerably more room for improvement. Regarding the impor-
tant case of pronoun interpretation, as determined in Section 6.2, more than 30% of the
failures are due to the assignment of incorrect gender attributes, and another 30% are
induced by cases that are beyond the horizon of the heuristic antecedent preference
strategies. Under the conditions of robust, operational processing, whereas the former
problem may be solved by a once-and-for-all improvement of the lexical resources, the
latter case remains difficult since, in general, background knowledge will be needed.
According to the results of the formal evaluation, at least a partial, genre-specific re-
finement of the preference strategies may be achieved in a manner compatible with the
conditions of robust processing. While a more systematic investigation and evaluation
of the latter issue is pending, the above results give rise to the expectation that, by
exploiting the potential for further improvements, robust approaches to anaphor reso-
lution should be able to achieve a precision of 0.8 (arbitrary antecedent discipline) and
0.75 (nonpronominal anchor discipline) even on difficult text genres like press releases.

Since, in particular due to structural ambiguity, the assumption of the availability of a unique syntactic reading proves to be unrealistic, robust anaphor resolution relies on techniques to overcome this deficiency. This paper describes the ROSANA approach, which generalizes the verification of coindexing restrictions in order to make it applicable to the deficient syntactic descriptions that are provided by a robust state-of-the-art parser. By a formal evaluation on two corpora that differ with respect to text genre and domain, it is shown that ROSANA achieves high-quality robust coreference resolution. Moreover, by an in-depth analysis, it is proven that the robust implementation of syntactic disjoint reference is nearly optimal. The study reveals that, compared with approaches that rely on shallow preprocessing, the largely nonheuristic disjoint reference algorithmization opens up the possibility for a slight improvement. Furthermore, it is shown that more significant gains are to be expected elsewhere, particularly from a text-genre-specific choice of preference strategies. The performance study of the ROSANA system crucially rests on an enhanced evaluation methodology for coreference resolution systems, the development of which constitutes the second major contribution of the paper. As a supplement to the model-theoretic scoring scheme that was developed for the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) evaluations, additional evaluation measures are defined that, on one hand, support the developer of anaphor resolution systems, and, on the other hand, shed light on application aspects of pronoun interpretation.</abstract>

Introduction The interpretation of anaphoric expressions is known to be a difficult problem. In principle, a variety of constraints and preference heuristics, including factors that rely on semantic, pragmatic, and world knowledge, contribute to this task (Carbonell and Brown 1988). Robust, operational approaches to anaphor resolution on unrestricted discourse, however, are confined to strategies exploiting globally available evidence like morphosyntactic, syntactic, and surface information. Beginning with the pioneering work of Hobbs (1978), many practical approaches rely on the availability of syntactic surface structure by employing coindexing restrictions, salience criteria, and parallelism heuristics (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994). However, even the assumption of the availability of a unique syntactic description is unrealistic since, in general, parsing involves th</context>

Structural coindexing constraints, however, may lose evidence in all the above cases of fragmentary syntax. Since they are known to be of central importance to the antecedent-filtering phase of operational anaphor resolution approaches, the subsequent discussion focuses on the impact of deficient surface structure description on disjoint reference restrictions. By referring to Chomsky&apos;s Government and Binding (GB) Theory, the core of the syntactic coindexing restrictions may be stated as follows (Chomsky 1981):4 Definition Binding principles A, B, and C: (A) A reflexive or reciprocal is bound in its binding category. (B) A pronoun is free (i.e., not bound) in its binding category. (C) A referring expression&apos; is free in any domain. where binding category denotes the next surface-structural dominator containing some kind of subject, and binding is defined as coindexed and c-commanding: 4 Various theoretical models that cover disjoint reference phenomena have been stated. Since the disjoint reference conditions are descriptive principles of grammar, the choice of the theoretical model is, in this sens</context>

Sentence (2b) illustrates the case of nonlocal binding (here: outside the embedded sentence), which is admissible only in the case of the nonreflexive pronoun. As illustrated by sentence (2c) and modeled by binding principle C, referring expressions (e.g., common nouns and names) are not even allowed to be bound nonlocally. A further structural well-formedness condition, commonly called the i-withini condition, aims at ruling out certain instances of referential circularity, that is, coindexings matching the pattern [a .. . [0 . ..],], (Chomsky 1981, page 212). It is motivated by cases like (3): (3) *Mary knows [the owner of his, boat]. The following example illustrates that syntactic fragmentation may interfere with the application of syntactic disjoint reference conditions: (4) Peter observed the owner of the telescope with it. In (4), the i-within-i condition possibly applies:6 the coindexing of telescope and it is admissible only if the PP containing it is not interpreted as an attribute to telescope— otherwise, in violation of the i-within-i condition, the pronoun would be contained in the NP of the tentative antecedent. Hence, if t</context>

Whereas in (i), where the possessive occurs in an adjunct phrase of the telescope NP, coindexing may be judged admissible, in (ii), where the possessive occurs in a complement phrase, coindexing seems to be inadmissible. If, however, the scope of the i-within-i condition were restricted to the complement cases (ii), then, since binding principle B does not apply, case (4) would remain unaccounted for. Whereas, in theory, it is widely agreed that the original definition of the i-within-i condition may be somewhat too strong (e.g., Chomsky 1981, page 212), with respect to the practical task of robust anaphor resolution, as the formal evaluations below will demonstrate, the original i-within-i condition is sufficient. In corpora, cases like (i) seem to be exceptional. 483 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 been resolved prior to anaphor resolution, the fragmentary syntactic description does not contribute the configurational evidence necessary for definitely confirming the antecedent candidate telescope. 3.

Since, at least for the most common types of third person pronouns (PER3, POS3), immediate antecedents are determined in virtually any case, the recall figures are almost identical (cf. the discussion in Section 5.3).

Introduction The interpretation of anaphoric expressions is known to be a difficult problem. In principle, a variety of constraints and preference heuristics, including factors that rely on semantic, pragmatic, and world knowledge, contribute to this task (Carbonell and Brown 1988). Robust, operational approaches to anaphor resolution on unrestricted discourse, however, are confined to strategies exploiting globally available evidence like morphosyntactic, syntactic, and surface information. Beginning with the pioneering work of Hobbs (1978), many practical approaches rely on the availability of syntactic surface structure by employing coindexing restrictions, salience criteria, and parallelism heuristics (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994).

In the present paper, an approach to robust anaphor resolution is developed that enhances the latter work. The coreference resolution algorithm ROSANA&apos; is developed, the core of which consists of a set of rule patterns by means of which the verification of disjoint reference rules is generalized in order to make it applicable to deficient (fragmentary) syntactic descriptions. Based on this algorithm, the ROSANA system, which works on the partial syntactic descriptions generated by the robust FDG (Functional Dependency Grammar of English) parser of Jarvinen and Tapanainen (1997), is implemented. By a formal evaluation on two text corpora that differ with respect to genre and domain, it is proven that ROSANA achieves robust (truly operational) high-quality coreference resolution on unrestricted texts. An in-depth analysis shows that the robust implementation of syntactic disjoint reference is nearly optimal. Compared with approaches that rely on a combination of shallow preprocessing and heuristic syntactic disjoint reference, the largely nonheuristic disjoint reference algorithmization employed by ROSANA opens up the possibility for a slight improvement.

The ROSANA system has been implemented in Common Lisp. In an evaluation on a set of news agency press releases (cf.

Besides the trivial way of achieving this kind of robustness by simply not exploiting deficient syntactic descriptions, the following two models may be employed: • the shallow description model: by employing heuristic rules to partially reconstruct the syntactic description, the anaphor resolution strategies are adapted to shallow input data that are never defective;3 • the deficient description model: by extending anaphor resolution strategies to work on a possibly ambiguous or incomplete description, syntactic evidence is exploited as far as available. In contrast to the approach of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), which follows the shallow description model, the ROSANA algorithm is based on the deficient description model. In principle, even a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; algorithm that establishes the conceptually superior degree of robustness by means of interaction between structural disambiguation and anaphor resolution is feasible (Stuckardt 1997). As will become evident, however, the technically less complex sequential strategy employed by ROSANA already yields high-quality results and does not leave much room for further improvement. 2 The deficiency may result either because the input itself is deficient or fro</context>

Step 2(a) of the ROSANA algorithm).

As a proper basis for comparing ROSANA with the approaches of Lappin and Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), one must focus on the evaluation results for third person pronouns in the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent discipline (as discussed in Section 6.2).

In the case of ROSANA, a precision of 0.75 is achieved on the corpus of press releases, which exhibits the typical properties of mass texts (e.g., a comparatively high rate of orthographic and syntactic errors) and, hence, presumably imposes high demands on robust processing. On the Mozart operas corpus, which, in this sense, is easier, the scores are considerably higher. However, since different evaluation corpora have been used, and, moreover, since the precision figure mentioned in the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) is not qualified with respect to text genre, a direct comparison of the empirical results should be based on further investigations.&apos; As an alternative way of comparing the two approaches, their performance with respect to the robust algorithmization of anaphor resolution strategies that rely on syntactic evidence (in particular, syntactic disjoint reference) may be evaluated in detail.

This gives evidence that, while the rate of disjoint reference failure is already very low (2.8% of all failures), a slight improvement may be achieved by employing a more defensive parsing strategy with a slightly higher level of syntactic fragmentation, which, by now, amounts to an average of 2.61 fragments per sentence.&apos; These findings may be compared with the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), which report 2 cases of pronoun misinterpretation (out of a total of 75 failures) that are due to a failure to establish configurationally determined disjoint reference, and several additional cases in which a wrong antecedent was chosen because of a wrong heuristic assignment of syntactic salience factors. Hence, with respect to syntactic disjoint reference, the failure rate of the shallow description approach (2.7% of all failures) of Kennedy and Boguraev is of the same order of magnitude as that of the deficient description approach followed by ROSANA (2.8%).

The general question of optimizing the choice of rule patterns, relative to a given parser, is an important issue that deserves further attention. 49 For example, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) mention the problem of interpreting quoted speech separately from its surrounding context, a complex problem whose solution should be facilitated if richer syntactic information is available. In fact, ROSANA already employs several successful heuristics for interpreting anaphors in quoted speech, such as the handling of first person pronouns that occur in the subject position of a quoted sentence. 50 Since the number of disjoint reference failures is already low, the potential benefits of employing a hybrid strategy are limited.

In the aforementioned operational approaches, a sequential processing model is followed according to which anaphor resolution is performed by referring to the result of an already completed syntactic analysis. Under this architecture, evidence for structural disambiguation that may be contributed by strong expectations at the referential layer is not taken into account (Stuckardt 1996). In terms of the general goals of robust processing, since there is no interaction, this implies that the robustness requirement only shows up in the form of the monotonicity and autonomy demands: the anaphor resolution module has to cope with deficient or shallow syntactic information. Besides the trivial way of achieving this kind of robustness by simply not exploiting deficient syntactic descriptions, the following two models may be employed: • the shallow description model: by employing heuristic rules to partially reconstruct the syntactic description, the anaphor resolution strategies a</context>

This information deficiency is partly overcome by the application of a regular filter that heuristically reconstructs parts of the constituent structure. An alternative solution, which is based on the possibly partial but potentially more comprehensive and reliable output of a conventional parser, has been suggested in Stuckardt (1997). In the present paper, an approach to robust anaphor resolution is developed that enhances the latter work. The coreference resolution algorithm ROSANA&apos; is developed, the core of which consists of a set of rule patterns by means of which the verification of disjoint reference rules is generalized in order to make it applicable to deficient (fragmentary) syntactic descriptions. Based on this algorithm, the ROSANA system, which works on the partial syntactic descriptions generated by the robust FDG (Functional Dependency Grammar of English) parser of Jarvinen and Tapanainen (1997), is implement</context>

In contrast to the approach of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), which follows the shallow description model, the ROSANA algorithm is based on the deficient description model. In principle, even a &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; algorithm that establishes the conceptually superior degree of robustness by means of interaction between structural disambiguation and anaphor resolution is feasible (Stuckardt 1997). As will become evident, however, the technically less complex sequential strategy employed by ROSANA already yields high-quality results and does not leave much room for further improvement. 2 The deficiency may result either because the input itself is deficient or from shortcomings of the processing resources (e.g., lexicon, grammar/parser, or semantic/pragmatic disambiguation). 3 Here, the monotonicity demand of intuitive robustness virtually vanishes, since there is no longer a syntactic input prone to deficiency. 481 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 2.3 Fragmentary Syntax T</context>

In the rule patterns for the fragmentary case, this subtlety is reflected implicitly in the sense that only regarding occurrence a (taken as the anaphor to be constructively resolved) is the strong version of binding principle A checked; hence, in the interdependency test Step 3(b), patterns [F2], [E2], and [E4] are not taken into consideration. 4.2 Implementation: The ROSANA System Based on the algorithm described in Figure 4, the ROSANA anaphor resolution system has been implemented (Stuckardt 2000). In primarily aiming at determining the coreference classes of nonzero linguistic expressions that specify entities,&apos; the scope of ROSANA corresponds to the coreference task of the Message Understanding Conferences (cf. Hirschman 1998). ROSANA handles a broad range of entity-specifying expressions—in particular, ordinary, possessive, reflexive/reciprocal, and relative pronouns, definite NPs, and names. The ROSANA system has been implemented in Common Lisp. In an evaluation on a set of news agency press releases (cf. Section 6), the runtime of the ROSANA system (without parser) was 165 tokens </context>

Hence, the parser is regarded to be an ideal associate of robust anaphor resolution approaches that follow the deficient description model. 4.3 Anaphoric Occurrences and Antecedent Candidates In the ROSANA system, the above algorithm is supplemented by a set of strategies for identifying occurrences (linguistic expressions that specify entities) and classifying them as anaphors to be resolved and/or as possible antecedent candidates. The criterion for the identification of specifying expressions is based on part of speech (as determined by the FDG parser) and syntactic context (Stuckardt 2000, page 249).20 Also, the decision of anaphoricity is based on evidence regarding the syntactic context: generally, occurrences of all three binding-theoretic types (A, B, C) are taken to be anaphoric;&apos; however, there are some classes of anaphoric occurrences that may, in certain cases, be interpreted in advance (outside the ROSANA core algorithm) by purely structural means (e.g., relative pronouns or occurrences induced by heads of appositions). For narrowing down the search space, occurrences of type A (reflexive and reciprocal pro17 In contrast to expressions that, for example, specify event</context>

Probably the best algorithmic strategy for determining correct anchors is the selection of the first nonpronominal cospecifying occurrence that topologically precedes the pronoun to be resolved (cf. the above decision chain argument). If, however, the distance between the determined substitute and the pronoun is small, from the point of view of conversational pragmatics it is implausible that the intension of the substitute occurrence does not match the (possibly opaque) context, since, otherwise, human readers are expected to be misled as well (Stuckardt 2000, page 240). 496 Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithm Table 2 Classification and scoring of nonpronominal anchors.

The performance study of the ROSANA system crucially rests on an enhancement of the evaluation methodology for coreference resolution systems, the development of which constitutes the second major contribution of the paper. As a supplement to the coreference class scoring scheme that was developed for the CO-task evaluation of the Message Understanding Conferences (Vilain et al. 1996), two additional evaluation disciplines are defined that, on one hand, aim at supporting the developer of anaphor resolution systems, and, on the other hand, shed light on application aspects of pronoun interpretation. The evaluation of ROSANA according to the refined scoring scheme gives evidence that the interpretation quality may be improved by a genrespecific choice of the preference factors and their relative weights. This demonstrates the usefulness of enhancing the evaluation methodology for coreference resolution systems. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the robustness </context>

In the following discussion, it will be advocated that, to obtain results that are expressive from the developer&apos;s as well as the application&apos;s point of view, several evaluation disciplines should be considered.&apos; 5.1 Model-Theoretic Coreference Scoring Vilain et al.

Basically, precision errors correspond to nontrivial partitions of system-generated equivalence classes induced by key equivalence classes, whereas recall errors correspond to nontrivial partitions of key equivalence classes induced by system-generated equivalence classes.
