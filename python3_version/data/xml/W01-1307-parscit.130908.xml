This paper deals with the way temporal
connectives affect Temporal Structure
as well as Discourse Structure in Nar-
ratives. It presents a contrastive study
of French connectives puis (then, after-
wards) and un peu plus tard (a bit later)
within the framework of Segmented
Discourse Representation Theory. It
shows that puis is a marker of the Narra-
tion discourse relation, whereas un peu
plus tard blocks Narration and licenses
only a weaker discourse relation, that
can be considered as a “weak Narra-
tion” involving only temporal succes-
sion. In addition, puis blocks Result,
while un peu plus tard does not.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999954770833334">
It is well known that tense, grammatical and pred-
icational aspect are very important clues in the
process of temporal interpretation of sentences,
and of texts (see (Kamp and Rohrer, 1983) among
others). As far as discourse level is concerned, it
has been shown that world knowledge and knowl-
edge about discourse structure play a role in de-
termining the text global temporal structure (Las-
carides and Asher, 1993; Caenepeel and Moens,
1994). In this paper we want to focus on the role
of connectives and their intersentential semantics.
We want to give an account of the way some
temporal connectives in French interact with dis-
course relations. We will examine differences
in the behavior of two connectives, namely puis
(then, afterwards) and un peu plus tard (a bit
later), when different discourse relations hold. At
first sight, the temporal contribution of these two
connectives should show little or no difference.
We will see that matters are not so simple.
This direction of work is inspired by a study
of puis showing differences in behaviour accord-
ing to the discourse relation at stake (Bras et al.,
2001). It is also grounded on previous studies
of adverbials of temporal location and adverbials
of spatial location and of their role to build the
spatio-temporal structure of discourse (Asher et
al., 1994; Asher et al., 1995a; Asher et al., 1995b;
Asher et al., 2001). We showed that, in the con-
text of trajectories, relational adverbials like un
peu plus tard and its spatial counterpart un peu
plus loin (a bit further) had symetric roles in the
process of locating the eventualities in space and
time, and could both be given the same spatio-
temporal interpretation.
We will tackle a comparative analysis of con-
nectives within the framework of a theory of
discourse structure and discourse relations. We
have chosen Segmented Discourse Representa-
tion Theory (SDRT) for its effective methodology
in investigating and formalizing how different lin-
guistic clues interact at the semantic/pragmatic in-
terface to recover the discourse structure of a text.
We will first briefly present SDRT (section 2),
and the Discourse Relations (section 3) that we
will use for our contrastive analysis ofpuis and un
peu plus tard with respect to Discourse Structure
(section 4).

We first present the theorical framework that
we chose to account for this interaction, namely
SDRT. SDRT is a non trivial extension of DRT that
takes discourse structure into account and offers a
theory of the semantics/pragmatics interface. We
give a brief outline of SDRT (see (Asher, 1993;
Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Asher, 1996; Bus-
quets et al., 2001) for a thorough presentation).
In SDRT a discourse is represented by an SDRS.
An SDRS is a recursive structure consisting of el-
ementary DRSs (i.e., DRSs representing a single
clause) and sub-SDRSs linked together by Dis-
course Relations, such as Narration, Elaboration,
Background, Continuation, Result, Contrast, Ex-
planation... These elementary DRSs and the sub-
SDRSs corresponding to complex discourse seg-
ments are the constituents of the SDRS represent-
ing the discourse. We use Greek letters as vari-
ables for constituents, and as constants.
SDRSs are built up incrementally. SDRT defines
a “Glue Logic&amp;quot; and an “Update Function&amp;quot; that to-
gether determine a new SDRS for a given SDRS
representing the context (the discourse already
processed), and a new constituent representing
the information to be integrated into that context.
The Glue Logic is embedded in the framework
of “Commonsense Entailment&amp;quot; (Asher and Mor-
reau, 1991), a logic that exploits both monotonic
( ) and non-monotonic ( )1 conditionals. The
Glue Logic is specified by:
definitions characterizing which constituents
in are open for attaching ,
axioms detailing what discourse relations
may be inferred, on the basis of a variety
of linguistic and common knowledge clues,
in order to actualize the attachment of to
some open constituent of ,
axioms specifying the semantic effects of
those discourse relations.
We will see some of these two kinds of axioms
below. The Update Function is in charge of the

In the following, we only present the discourse re-
lations used in SDRT that will be helpful to anal-
yse our data: Narration and Result. One impor-
tant aspect of SDRT that is worth emphasizing at
this point is that several discourse relations may
simultaneously link the same two constituents.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992444">
3.1 Narration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.881021517241379">
Narration is a relation which is based on
the Gricean pragmatic constraint of orderliness.
When two clauses are linked by Narration, they
describe in sequence two successive events “of
the same story&amp;quot;.
Let us first see more precisely what the seman-
tics effects of Narration on discourse content are.
Building on the previous analyses of (Lascarides
and Asher, 1993), we showed in (Asher et al.,
1995a) that a relation of Narration between two
constituents and entails a temporal overlap
between the resulting state of the main eventual-
ity of (noted 2), , and the preceding
state of , , in the absence of locating
adverbials. This is what axiom (A1) expresses:
A 1 Narration post pre
(A1) aims at capturing the fact that narratives
must cohere in the sense that the events linked
together by Narration must fit consistently and
without significant spatio-temporal gaps as ex-
pressed in (Asher, 1996) and observed in earlier
work on temporal order in narratives (see for ex-
ample (Caenepeel, 1989)). This doesn’t mean
that there should be no interval of time between
the two events and , but rather that no rele-
vant event can occur during this interval. From
(A1) and uncontroversial ordering assumptions
on events and their pre- and post-states3, we can
deduce a relation of temporal precedence between

the events and : . Actually, to
fully capture the “no-significant-gap” constraint,
a temporal overlap is too weak. As we will see
in Section 4.1, we should guarantee that
persists (at least) up to the beginning of , and,
conversely, that starts when (or before)
ends. So we propose here an improved ver-
sion of (A1), where denotes the “intersection”
operator4:
A 2 Narration
✜ post pre
Narration has another semantic effect. It is
motivated by the intuition that the elements of a
Narration must belong to the “same story&amp;quot;, i.e.,
they must have some common subject matter. To
this effect, axiom (A3) expresses that the con-
stituents connected together by Narration must
have a common Topic. A topic is a simple con-
stituent which is contingent (i.e., not vacuous,
not contradictory, not tautologic), and subsumes
the constituents of a sub-SDRS, in this case, the
constituents linked by Narration. If not already
present in the context, it has to be added to the
SDRS during the update. (A3) and the rules of
the underlying logic actually imply that Narration
can be non-monotonically inferred only if such a
topic exists or can be built.

where means that is to be attached to
in the SDRS , and is a subordinating dis-
course relation whose semantics essentially in-
volves subsumption between the topic and the el-
ements of the narrative it summarizes.
Now, how do we infer Narration? Since (Las-
carides and Asher, 1993), the triggering axioms
for Narration have changed to reflect the fact that
Narration is not always a default in narratives
(Asher, 1996). It is only a default if no other re-
lation can be inferred, that is, if in the discourse
there are no clues that other axioms could exploit
to infer other discourse relations:

where are all the discourse re-
lations used in SDRT5 but Narration, and
Clues_ holds whenever the proposi-
tional content of and and the discourse struc-
ture of contain clues that could be exploited for
inferring .
In addition, Narration can be non-
monotonically inferred if the predicate Occasion
holds between the clauses to be related:
A 5 Occasion
Narration
Occasion holds if the two clauses contain clues
indicating that their main eventualities are of
types that may belong to “the same story&amp;quot;. In
other words, Occasion exploits lexical semantics
and shared knowledge in terms of scripts connect-
ing certain event types in sequences in which one
event “naturally&amp;quot; leads to the next. For instance,
(1) is an example of Narration where Occasion
holds, since there is clearly in the shared knowl-
edge a script in which, before entering, people
knock at the door.

<listItem confidence="0.941225">
(1) Paul frappa à la porte. Il entra. (Paul

<bodyText confidence="0.9687298">
knocked at the door. He entered.)
We can assume this kind of script to be encoded
in the following axiom:
A 6 knock door-of 6
enter Occasion
In this case, the sequence of events is only typ-
ical, i.e., “natural&amp;quot;: knocking isn’t a necessary
precondition to enter, and it doesn’t cause the
entering. Obviously, stronger dependence links
between event types like precondition and cause
also give rise to Occasion (and by non-monotonic
inference, Narration), but some of them are also
exploited to infer more specific discourse rela-
tions, like the next one to be presented here, Re-
sult.

5SDRT explicit states that there should be a finite number
of discourse relations, even though what these are precisely
is not a settled matter yet. For the purposes of the present
work, we will consider that these relations are: Narration,
Background, Elaboration, Continuation, (i.e., “Topic&amp;quot;),
Result, Explanation, Contrast and Parallel, for which an
SDRT account can be found in the literature.

3.2 Result
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970260533333333">
The Result relation has the semantic effect of im-
plying a causal link between the main eventuali-
ties of the constituents it relates:
A 7 Result Cause
The predicate Cause implies, among
other things, that if and are events, the first
temporally precedes the second:
Result may be monotonically inferred on the
basis of the presence in of an explicit marker of
causation as e.g., the conjunct donc (therefore) or
the verb to result:
Result can also be non-monotonically inferred
on the basis of lexical semantics or of some shared
knowledge on the types of eventualities in and
, as in the following two famous examples:

<bodyText confidence="0.995821666666666">
In (2) and (3), it is again generic script-like
information on pushing and falling event types,
and on switching off the light event types and be-
ing dark state types that enables the reader to re-
cover the causal links that the narrator most likely
wanted to express. The presence of such clues in-
dicating a possible causal link is expressed by the
predicate D-Permissible-Cause. For instance, we
assume that the following axiom encodes a plau-
sible piece of shared knowledge:

sult:

4 Connectives and Discourse Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940875">
In this section, we want to compare the behaviour
of connectives puis and un peu plus tard7 in com-
bination with Passé Simple sentences in order
to find out to what extent they affect Discourse
Structure. We are first going to present series of
examples and give the intuitions that native speak-
ers may have about their interpretation. Let us
first compare the examples in (4):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.969028888888889">
(4) a. L’acide tomba dans le mélange. Une
explosion se produisit. (The acid fell
into the mixture. An explosion hap-
pened.)
b. L’acide tomba dans le mélange. Puis
une explosion se produisit.
c. L’acide tomba dans le mélange. Un
peu plus tard une explosion se pro-
duisit.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996450181818182">
The three examples are good. They all ex-
press a relation of temporal sucession between
the events. But we feel that another issue is at
stake. In (4-a), the explosion event is not only in-
terpreted as posterior to, but also as a result of,
the acid falling event. This interpretation is still
valid for (4-c), but it is lost in (4-b). With puis, it
seems that the events are presented from an exter-
nal, objective, point of view, as if the speaker did
not intend to express any kind of resultative link.
Let us now look at (5):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981233285714286">
(5) a. La petite fille s’endormit. Il se mit à
pleuvoir. (The little girl fell asleep. It
began to rain.)
b. La petite fille s’endormit. Puis il se
mit à pleuvoir.
c. La petite fille s’endormit. Un peu
plus tard, il se mit à pleuvoir.
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.93566825">
7Un peu plus tard is to be considered as representing a
class of adverbials which have the same syntactic schema
NP plus tard/après and the same semantic function, i.e. ad-
verbials setting a temporal relation between two temporal
referents. Such relational adverbials introduce themselves a
new time referent by coercion only in contexts requiring a
temporal anchorage as in: Paul entra dans la pièce. Cinq
minutes plus tard, Marie pleurait. (Paul entered the room.
Five minutes later, Mary was crying.). Notice that puis can-
not be coerced this way: Paul entra dans la pièce. *Puis
Marie pleurait. We here compare a whole class of adver-
bials to the single adverb puis.

We feel that the use of puis in (5-b) is not as
straightforward as the use of un peu plus tard in
(5-c). In order to interpret (5-b) —and (5-a) to a
lesser extent— it seems that we have to imagine a
specific context, for example “the story of a little
girl lost in the woods&amp;quot;, in which the contribution
of each sentence to the coherence of the discourse
is obvious. Un peu plus tard does not require this
kind of constraint.
The difference is less important when there is
already a link between the events, as in (6):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.738491454545455">
(6) a. Marie 6crivit une longue lettre à son
cousin. Elle alla la poster au village

b. Marie 6crivit une longue lettre à son
cousin. Puis elle alla la poster au vil-
lage voisin.
c. Marie 6crivit une longue lettre à son
cousin. Un peu plus tard, elle alla la
poster au village voisin.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986333333333">
Here we do not need a particular context to in-
terpret (6-b) —nor (6-a). Nevertheless, the events
seem to be more disconnected in (6-c) than in
(6-b) or (6-a). Now we want to examine how the
intuitions described above may be accounted for
in the SDRT framework.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984085">
4.1 Puis and un peu plus tard with Narration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995866333333333">
In (Bras et al., 2001), we argue that puis is a
rhetorical marker which introduces a relation of
Narration:
In both (5-a) and (5-b), Narration will be in-
ferred, by default with (A4) for (5-a), thanks to
puis with (A12) for (5-b). Our hypothesis to ac-
count for the different interpretation in (5-c), is
that un peu plus tard blocks Narration. But let
us explain further. Let us first consider the tem-
poral effect of Narration described in (A2), set-
ting that the intersection of the poststate of and
the prestate of exists and fills the interval be-
tween the two events. Again, this means that the
events must fit consistently and without signifi-
cant spatio-temporal gaps. A way to test the pos-
sibility of a relevant spatio-temporal gap between
the two events is to try to insert a third event be-
tween and such that it terminates ,
i.e, an event whose poststate is incompatible with
, for instance the event of the little girl’s
waking up: 8
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.725254538461538">
(7) a. La petite fille s’endormit. Il se mit
à pleuvoir. *Elle venait juste de se

/ *Entretemps elle s’6tait r6veill6e.
(Meanwhile she had woken up.)
b. La petite fille s’endormit. Puis il se
mit à pleuvoir.*Elle venait juste de se
r6veiller. / *Entretemps elle s’6tait
r6veill6e.
c. La petite fille s’endormit. Un peu
plus tard, il se mit à pleuvoir. Elle
venait juste de se r6veiller. / En-
tretemps elle s’6tait r6veill6e.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.96850888172043">
The test on the temporal effect of Narration
only fails in (7-c). It is successful in (7-a) and
(7-b), as the insertion of an intermediate event ap-
pears to be very difficult. Let us insist that our
examples are built in such a way that the interme-
diate events actually implies the end of post ,
hence a temporal gap between and . If not
so, the adding of another event with entretemps
poses no problem. For instance:
(8) La petite fille s’endormit. Puis il se mit à
pleuvoir. Entretemps la nuit 6tait tomb6e.
(Meanwhile the night hadfallen.)
is perfectly acceptable, since the falling of the
night does not imply that the little girl is no
longer asleep. Let us also note that it might
be possible to improve (7-a) and (7-b), by in-
troducing the third event with something like
Ajoutons/précisons que, entretemps, la petite fille
s’était réveillée (Let’s add /point out that, mean-
while, the little girl had woken up). In such a case,
however, there is an explicit phenomenon of cor-
rection (of the way the events have been narrated),
and so it is not surprising that the temporal effects
of Narration should be revised.
We come now to the second semantic effet of
Narration, topic requirement (A3). As we said
8See (Caenepeel, 1995) that investigates the conditions
for the insertion intermediate events in a narrative sequence.
A 12
❦puis Narration
above, we do not need any special context to inter-
pret (5-c). On the contrary, a link seems to be re-
quired between the two events in (5-a) and (5-b),
which corresponds to (A3) topic requirement. Let
us note that this requirement seems to be stronger
in (5-b). This is an indication that puis is more
demanding on topic than a simple Narration. We
leave this apart for now, and turn to the difference
between puis and un peu plus tard.
At this point, we need to address the issue of
the relation between the sentence introduced by
un peu plus tard and the sentence . Of course,
un peu plus tard contributes a temporal relation
of succession between the events. But apart from
this contribution, the relation between and
does not match the semantic effects of Narration.
This leads us to claim that with the temporal in-
dication contributed by un peu plus tard, the re-
lation of Narration does not hold. Now, (7-c) be-
ing a coherent discourse, what discourse relation
holds? We hypothesize that it should be a rela-
tion that only supports temporal precedence, that
could be viewed as a kind of weak Narration. To
account for this, we propose to view Narration as
a gradual relation that normally occurs under its
strong form, and always at least under its weak
form:
This change implies updating the axioms given
in the previous sections: Narration has to be sub-
stituted by Strong-Narration in the axioms (A2),
(A3), (A5) and (A12). In (A4), the general Nar-
ration relation remains. Weak-Narration has no
requirement on topic nor does it have the “no gap
constraint”. The only semantic effects of Weak-
Narration is temporal precedence:
A 15 Weak-Narration
With such limited semantic effects, un peu
plus tard is obviously compatible with Weak-
Narration. It must be noted though, that here we
do not claim that adverbials of this kind should be
considered as rhetorical markers of this relation.
Unlike puis, syntactically they do not behave as
conjuncts. Moreover, their main semantic con-
tribution materializes compositionally within the
constituent itself, specifying not only temporal
succession between two temporal referents, but
also the length of the temporal interval between
these referents.
Let us now come back to example (6) in the
light of these considerations on the role of un
peu plus tard. In both (6-a) and (6-b), a Strong-
Narration relation will be inferred, because Oc-
casion holds and (A5) is triggered for (6-a), by
(A12) for (6-b). Unlike for example (5) just anal-
ysed, Occasion holds in both cases, and thus we
can assume it is easy to buid a common topic to
both sentences. The example in (6-c) is perfectly
all right, but bears a slightly different interpreta-
tion: here the strong link between the two events
is lost. It is indeed quite possible to introduce an
intervening event, as (9-c) shows, while this is not
possible for the two other examples, viz. (9-a) and
(9-b):

Therefore, un peu plus tard blocks Strong-
Narration not only when it could have been in-
ferred by default, but also when Occasion holds.
In order to account for this blocking, we introduce
the following axioms:

cludes the inference of any relation at all9.
Let us come back again to (6) to add that the
perception of difference between (6-a) and (6-b)
on the one hand, and (6-c) on the other hand,
is certainly also due to a particularity of un peu
plus tard concerning plans. As a matter of fact, it
seems that the presence of un peu plus tard has the
effect of blocking the interpretation that events
and are part of a plan (a plan in which is in-
tended to lead to ). The difference in terms of
planning is more obvious on examples like (10):
(10) Marie rejoignit son ami, puis lui glissa
à l’oreille qu’elle voulait partir. (Marie
rejoined her friend, then she dropped in
his ear that she wanted to leave.)
This example lends itself to an interpretation
in which Marie reaches her friend in order to tell
him something. But the plan interpretation seems
to be suspended when puis is replaced with un peu
plus tard10:
(11) Marie rejoignit son ami ; un peu plus
tard, elle lui glissa à l’oreille qu’elle
voulait partir.
It seems to us that the difference in behaviour
evidenced here should be explained once more at
the rhetorical level. It would probably require in
some contexts the use of a relation of Enablement
(Sandström, 1993), allowed by puis, and again,
blocked by un peu plus tard. We leave this for
further research since how exactly Enablement is
to be accounted for in SDRT has not yet been in-
vestigated in the literature.

<bodyText confidence="0.925952896551724">
Let us now come back to (4). We want to account
for the different interpretations of (4-a) and (4-c)
on the one hand, and of (4-b) on the other hand.
Assuming that there is most probably some piece
of shared knowledge on chemicals implying that
9From , , , and ,(and not )
is inferred (Penguin principle). From ,, and
, if and are logically independent, CE cannot conclude
nor (Nixon Diamond).
10Or, for that matter, another adverbial indicating an even
shorter temporal separation like immédiatement après
D-Permissible-Cause holds between the two con-
stituents representing the two clauses, SDRT non-
monotonically concludes Result with (A11). As
was shown in (Bras et al., 2001), puis blocks the
non-monotonic inference to Result. Notice that
(4-b) remains neutral regarding the truth value of
and it could still be that the two
events described are actually causally connected.
Simply, the narrator doesn’t commit himself. Puis
directly blocks the rhetorical relation of Result,
and not the factual relation of Cause. Hence we
need as an additional axiom:
For its part, un peu plus tard doesn’t seem to
directly interfere with the Result relation. In (4-c)
we get the reading of a mere “delayed” result,
which the theory accounts for by inferring Result
just like for (4-a). However, in some contexts, un
peu plus tard also appears to block Result:

<listItem confidence="0.939675857142857">
(12) a. Max trébucha. Il tomba et se cassa
la jambe. (Max stumbled. He fell
and broke his leg.)
b. Max trébucha. Puis il tomba et se
cassa la jambe.
c. Max trébucha. Un peu plus tard, il
tomba et se cassa la jambe.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999774666666667">
In both (12-b) and (12-c), the causal reading
of (12-a) is lost. The preferred reading is not
that the narrator doesn’t want to commit himself
regarding the causal connection, but rather that
he is describing two unrelated, temporally sepa-
rated, occasions on which Max lost his balance.
A Cause relation between two events may entail
a more precise temporal relation than temporal
succession. Shared knowledge may stipulate that
some kinds of events causally related occur in a
single flow, without any temporal gap at all be-
tween them. This stronger temporal relation cor-
responds to the relation, and is clearly in-
compatible with any indication that there exists
a (non-null) temporal interval between the two
events. In (12-a), it seems indeed that as soon as
the stumbling ends, the falling has started. With
this piece of knowledge, both puis and un peu plus
tard prevent to hold, since they
both specify the existence of a temporal interval
between and .

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986592592592">
We wanted to compare two connectives and the
way they affect Temporal Structure and Discourse
Structure. From the temporal point of view, we
have observed that both puis and un peu plus
tard express temporal succession, but that puis
has a stronger temporal semantics contents (
post pre ). From the Dis-
course Structure point of view, we have shown
that puis is a marker of Strong-Narration, involv-
ing the notion of telling the “same story” (topic),
whereas un peu plus tard blocks Strong-Narration
and licences Weak-Narration, involving no more
semantic effects than temporal succession. In ad-
dition, puis blocks Result, while un peu plus tard
doesn’t. We believe it particularly interesting to
notice that a priori temporally equivalent adver-
bials may have so different effects on Discourse
Structure. On the one hand, puis has an impor-
tant role at the rhetorical level, which is no sur-
prise given its conjunct character. On the other
hand, un peu plus tard is not the purely temporal
adverbial that one could expect, since it is capa-
ble of blocking some discourse relations, among
which Strong-Narration, the usual case of Narra-
tion. And this is certainly not an obvious fact for
an adverbial primarily indicating temporal suc-
cession.

In addition, puis blocks Result, while un peu plus tard does not. 1 Introduction It is well known that tense, grammatical and predicational aspect are very important clues in the process of temporal interpretation of sentences, and of texts (see (Kamp and Rohrer, 1983) among others). As far as discourse level is concerned, it has been shown that world knowledge and knowledge about discourse structure play a role in determining the text global temporal structure (Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Caenepeel and Moens, 1994). In this paper we want to focus on the role of connectives and their intersentential semantics. We want to give an account of the way some temporal connectives in French interact with discourse relations. We will examine differences in the behavior of two connectives, namely puis (then, afterwards) and un peu plus tard (a bit later), when different discourse relations hold. At first sight, the temporal contribution of these two connectives should show little or no difference. We will see that matters are not so simple.

Now, how do we infer Narration? Since (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), the triggering axioms for Narration have changed to reflect the fact that Narration is not always a default in narratives (Asher, 1996). It is only a default if no other relation can be inferred, that is, if in the discourse there are no clues that other axioms could exploit to infer other discourse relations: A 4 Clues_ Clues_ 4We assume that , when applicable, yields a new state lasting the maximum interval of time during which both and hold, and whose propositional contents is the conjunction of and ’s propositional contents.

One important aspect of SDRT that is worth emphasizing at this point is that several discourse relations may simultaneously link the same two constituents. 3.1 Narration Narration is a relation which is based on the Gricean pragmatic constraint of orderliness. When two clauses are linked by Narration, they describe in sequence two successive events “of the same story&amp;quot;. Let us first see more precisely what the semantics effects of Narration on discourse content are. Building on the previous analyses of (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), we showed in (Asher et al., 1995a) that a relation of Narration between two constituents and entails a temporal overlap between the resulting state of the main eventuality of (noted 2), , and the preceding state of , , in the absence of locating adverbials.
