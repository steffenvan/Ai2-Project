fundamental vocabulary (untouchable by the user), and
&amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; vocabularies.
The traditional view of MT as a process of tree structure
transformation through pattern matching is complemented
by the more recent lexical approach in which the descrip-
tion of grammatical usage is stored in the dictionary as part
of the information attached to specific words, and in which
more specific rules block the more general ones (cf. Nagao
1987). Dictionary construction is therefore essential to the
enterprise, and one may hope that Nagao&apos;s plea for a
standardized dictionary format and international coopera-
tion in the elaboration of lexicons will be answered by the
recent dictionary and text database initiatives that have
been launched to meet those needs.
As a conclusion, Chapter 8 proposes Nagao&apos;s views on
the future of MT; these are summarized in the preface by
Nagao&apos;s Figure 0.1, which predicts a steady improvement
in the commercial systems and a sharp rise in the number of
MT users during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Nagao
also predicts that the improvements due to research in
syntax and semantics have basically leveled off, and that
further progress will come from research on intersentential
components from an Al rather than purely linguistic point
of view. For instance, one of the phenomena that MT
cannot yet handle is discourse analysis, and both the resolu-
tion of intersentential relations and the resolution of refer-
entials without a referent in the text require making infer-
ences about the world. However, Nagao makes the nice
point that it is very difficult for an NLP system driven by
inferences to deal with new relationships set up in a text,
while this is what natural language does all the time (i.e.,
creates novel sentences that are interpretable). High-level
translation capabilities will require long-term basic re-
search both in theoretical linguistics and in cognitive sci-
ence, going beyond the limits of traditional linguistics on
particular languages and toward a theory of translation.
As MT is still in its infancy, Nagao advocates a realistic
assessment of its possibilities by following the &amp;quot;engineering
practice of limitations based on assumptions about
functionality.&amp;quot; For example, the problem of voice recogni-
tion must be solved for interpreting systems, and because of
efficiency considerations, the future of interactive systems
probably lies in small-quantity private systems. As a final
thought-provoking remark: MT is probably more useful
between pairs of languages that do not have many mutual
speakers, rather than the classic pairs of well-known lan-
guages.

&amp;quot;COBUILD&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;Collins Birmingham University
International Language Database,&amp;quot; and reflects the joint
nature of the work on lexical computing shared between the
University of Birmingham and Collins Publishers. The
COBUILD dictionary project, going back to early 1980,
resulted in the publication in 1987 of the Collins CO-
BUILD English Language Dictionary. There are at least
three major factors that set it apart from other learners&apos;
dictionaries of English language: it is a wholly new diction-
ary; it reflects present-day usage of English; and, in style of
presentation of entries, it represents a radical departure
from existing lexicographic conventions. By its own ac-
count, &amp;quot;the techniques used to compile [the dictionary] are
new and use advanced computer technology. For the user
the kind of information is different, the quality of informa-
tion is different, and the presentation of information is
different&amp;quot; (from the introduction to the COBUILD Diction-
ary).
This difference stems from the interleaving of several
basic principles in applied linguistics and dictionary compi-
lation, and the particular ways in which these have influ-
enced lexicographic practice in the course of preparing the
dictionary. Language is a constantly changing dynamic
system; consequently, no existing—and by that token al-
ready out-of-date—reference materials (including other
dictionary sources) have been used in the process of compil-
ing COBUILD. Rather, the analysis of words, from deci-
sions concerning the makeup of the word list to the specific

Book Reviews Looking Up: An Account of the COBUILD Pnomcr IN LEXICAL COMPUTING
content of individual entries, has been carried out entirely
on the basis of studies of a large corpus of English texts,
both spoken and written. As Gwyneth Fox, one of the
contributors to the book, points out: lexicographers &amp;quot;have
learned what happens when [they] sit and intuit how words
are used—[they] are likely to get it wrong.&amp;quot; This is, in a
nutshell, the difference in method between &amp;quot;armchair
lexicography&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;corpus lexicography&amp;quot;; and while the
COBUILD dictionary remains to be judged as an artifact
of the latter (see, e.g., Fillmore 1989), it is Looking Up that
addresses the issues behind the principles, the motivations,
and the realization of the corpus-based methodology of
dictionary construction.
There are several main themes running through the
book, recurring through most of the chapters in one way or
another. The importance, to a project concerned with large-
scale word studies, of corpus evidence for the way language
is used within a certain time frame is clearly one of the
major premises of the whole COBUILD enterprise. More
than just as a side effect, this project has had to make
extensive use of some specially designed computational
tools, primarily for corpus maintenance and analysis, as
well as for text database management. Another central
notion is that of word use, rather than meaning, which is
central to the dictionary design and presentation. In partic-
ular, what emerges from the corpus is a body of evidence
for distinct word patterns, themselves associated with func-
tions and uses of words. The consequences, for the whole
dictionary project, can be traced in the ways this evidence
has influenced decisions about how to divide a word into
word senses, necessitated radically new style and conven-
tions for explaining meaning, or constrained the choice of
illustrative material (such as examples) included in diction-
ary entries.
The book itself roughly follows these themes, with its ten
chapters falling into three major categories.
Lexical computing &amp;quot;Corpus Development&amp;quot; by Antoi-
nette Renouf and &amp;quot;Computing&amp;quot; by Jeremy Clear address
the issues of building up, from scratch, a representative
corpus of English texts and the problems of storing, process-
ing, and analyzing these in order to distill representative
(and manageable) samples of word uses. The first chapter
is concerned with the nature of a set of corpora (main;
reserve; monitor; of spoken interaction; and so forth) re-
quired for the task of building word profiles. The second
chapter presents the functionality of a set of concordancing
programs (for processing and collating 7.3 million words of
raw data) and of a structured database for storing the
lexicographers&apos; analysis and interpretation of the corpus
data together with the evidence in support of these analy-
ses.
Dictionary content The first task in which traditional
lexicography and modern technology begin to blend is that
of deciding upon the global content of the dictionary. &amp;quot;The
Process of Compilation&amp;quot; by Ramesh Krishnamurthy dis-
cusses the nature of lexical data, from the perspective of
what aspects of a word should ultimately be recorded in its
entry, as well as the compilation and organization of such
data on a large scale. In effect, this chapter sets down the
&amp;quot;style guide&amp;quot; for the COBUILD dictionary. &amp;quot;The Analysis
of Meaning&amp;quot; by Rosamund Moon then focuses primarily
on criteria for making sense distinctions, within a word
entry, on the basis of evidence found in corpus citations. In
&amp;quot;The Nature of the Evidence,&amp;quot; John Sinclair examines in
detail the way word patterns relate to uses and meanings of
individual words; even though this comes rather late in the
book (Chapter 8), much of the analysis here underlies the
application of the criteria set down in Moon&apos;s paper.
Dictionary presentation The remainder of the book largely
concerns the ways in which the main principle of the
COBUILD project has been &amp;quot;implemented&amp;quot; in the diction-
ary. More specifically, discussions focus on different as-
pects of the same question: having built a representative
profile of word uses and meanings, how the relationship is
best conveyed to the dictionary users. It is in the methods
for expressing this, perspicuously and concisely, that the
break with long-established traditions in lexicography be-
comes most apparent. Essential components of an entry in a
learners&apos; dictionary are its pronunciation, syntactic (gram-
matical) annotation, definition, and examples fields. The
chapters by David Brasil (&amp;quot;Representing Pronunciation&amp;quot;),
John Sinclair (&amp;quot;Grammar in the Dictionary&amp;quot;), Patrick
Hanks (&amp;quot;Definitions and Explanations&amp;quot;), and Gwyneth
Fox (&amp;quot;The Case for Examples&amp;quot;), thus have a common
denominator: they outline notational conventions used in
dictionaries to date, discuss a number of shortcomings
there (some of which follow from the highly terse and
compact nature of dictionary entries, and some from an
inability to relate an entry to how a word is, or should be,
used), and present a set of principles and/or a system for
dictionary entry presentation that is intimately linked to
the notion of explaining how a word influences, and is
influenced by, context.
Viewed from such a perspective, the chapters in the book
form a much more cohesive whole than the average edited
collection. Even the last chapter, &amp;quot;Moving on&amp;quot; by Antoi-
nette Renouf, while apparently not directly related to any
part of the COBUILD dictionary project, reminds the
reader that the design of that particular dictionary is only a
part of a larger effort whose ultimate goal is to develop a
comprehensive database of lexical data, applicable beyond
the task of creating just one dictionary, and relevant to
disciplines other than just lexicography. (Renouf describes
the design of a series of course books, Collins COBUILD
English Course, derived from the same text corpus.)
This book is primarily about lexicography; read in con-
junction with a more or less standard text on dictionary
making (for instance, Landau 1989), it demonstrates the
scope and complexities of compiling dictionaries, lexicons,
glossaries, and so forth. By that token alone, as well as due
to the very nature of its subject matter, it should be of
interest to computational linguists. However, what makes
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 185
Book Reviews Generating Natural Language under Pragmatic Constraints
the book more of a recommended reading is the renewed
empiricism in the field, largely promoted by the very practi-
cal need to scale up natural language systems, and largely
due to the realization that linguistic information about
words could be derived from massive on-line text resources.
Whether these resources come in the shape of on-line
dictionaries or text corpora is immaterial here. By reading
Looking Up, one becomes acutely aware of the richness of
lexical information available in (and distributed over) mil-
lions of words of text. One also understands that careful
inspection of a dictionary entry (or a set of related entries)
is likely to reveal considerably more in terms of lexical
properties of the word (or class of words) than is apparently
visible. The nature of lexical information in, and its extract-
ability from, such text resources has been much discussed
recently in the computational linguistics and computa-
tional lexicography literature; in particular, the statement
that there is a wealth of implicit information available in
on-line dictionaries and corpora has been made over and
over again recently (see, for instance, Atkins et al. 1988;
Boguraev and Briscoe 1989; Hindle 1989; Church and
Hanks 1989). However, there is a world of difference
between &amp;quot;retro-engineering,&amp;quot; by whatever means, methods
and rules for inferring lexical information from dictionary
entries, and being told in advance the kinds of lexical
regularities, generalizations, and properties encoded in these
entries. For that reason alone, and particularly given that
the COBUILD dictionary is available in machine-readable
form, Looking Up is a book that should not be ignored by
researchers interested in computational lexicography, lexi-
cal semantics, or simply the nature of word meaning.

This book is a revised version of the author&apos;s dissertation,
which was submitted to Yale University in February 1987
and published as a research report (Hovy 1987). One
shouldn&apos;t be too surprised to learn from the preface that
Roger C. Schank, Drew McDermott, and Bob Abelson
were the honorable members of the thesis committee. Vari-
ous well-known Al researchers—not exclusively from
Yale--have given a hand while the thesis was on its way
and are therefore mentioned in the acknowledgments. The
acknowledgments, by the way, give a first example of how
stylistic features affect the generation of text: Hovy switches
between several styles (formality, verbosity, gratefulness,
haste) while expressing his thanks to different classes of
persons. The preface stresses that the book is not only
useful to computational linguists, but also to theoretical
linguists, especially those working in generation. Thus, the
last section of every chapter deals with implementation and
might be skipped by readers not interested in the computa-
tional issues.
The book describes the generation system PAULINE, which
was developed and implemented by the author. The sys-
tem&apos;s name is an acronym: Planning And Uttering Lan-
guage In Natural Environments. (It is also the name of
Hov:y&apos;s sister).
Chapter 1 (11 pp.) introduces the specific research area:
how do pragmatic and stylistic issues influence the genera-
tion of natural language texts? Starting with real-world
descriptions of an event at Yale, the destruction of a
shantytown by university authorities, it is demonstrated
how different viewpoints of the respective authors affect
texts. The same event is then described by PAULINE in
different pragmatic adjustments. The event itself is repre-
sented in a network of about 120 elements (presumably
some version of conceptual dependency), and it is claimed
that the system produces over 100 different texts. The
second example is a description of a fictitious primary
election between Carter and Kennedy as Democratic presi-
dential candidates. &amp;quot;Well, so Carter lost the primary to
Kennedy by 1335 votes&amp;quot; is one example of a very condensed
description. This terseness is beaten only by example num-
ber 12, which consists of nothing but blanks: &amp;quot;The program
