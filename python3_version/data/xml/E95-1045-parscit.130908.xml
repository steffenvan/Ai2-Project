This paper investigates the syntax of
extraposition in the HPSG framework.
We present English and German data
(partly taken from corpora), and provide
an analysis using a nonlocal dependency
and lexical rules. The condition for bind-
ing the dependency is formulated rela-
tive to the antecedent of the extraposed
phrase, which entails that no fixed site
for extraposition exists. Our account al-
lows to explains the interaction of extra-
position with fronting and coordination,
and predicts constraints on multiple ex-
traposition.

1.1 Extraposition of S and PP
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.753760375">
In English, phrases can be extraposed, i.e., dislo-
cated to the right boundary of a sentence. This
phenomenon can be observed with adjuncts, such
as relative clauses or PPs in (1)—(3), as well as
with sentential and prepositional complements as
in (4)—(6):1

The antecedent (the category from which the dis-
located element is extraposed) is a noun in these
cases. Languages in which the right VP bound-
ary is clearly marked (as e.g. by the non-finite
verb in verb-second languages) can provide evi-
dence for extraposition with verbal antecedents.
Cf. the following German data, which include the
extraposition of adjuncts in (7) and (8), and that
of complements in (9) and (10).

But also in English, we find evidence for extrapo-

to the VP, and hence by default have to follow VP
complements:

1.2 Multiple Extraposition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999539">
It is possible to have more than one extraposed
phrase, as shown in (13) and (14):2
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9963834">
(13) A man _, _3 came in [with blond hair], [who
was smilingly
(14) A paper _, just came out [which talks
about extraposition], [which you might be
interested in],.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9401556">
In these examples, both extraposed elements are
associated with the same antecedent. We observe
that the serialization for multiple extraposed el-
ements matters for PPs, but not for relative
clauses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9946128">
(15)* A man _, -3 came in [who was smiling],
[with blond hair],.
(16) A paper _, just came out [which you
might be interested in]; [which talks about
extraposition].
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9123545">
We find a different pattern for multiple extraposi-
tion involving distinct antecedents:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997870666666667">
(17) It, struck a grammarian -3 last month
[who analyzed kJ., [that this clause is
grammatical]2. (Hai)
(18)* It, struck a grammarian —2 last month [that
this clause is grammatical], [who analyzed
it]3. (Hai)
(19) No one _, puts things -3 in the sink [that

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.94815804">
(20)*No one _, puts things -3 in the sink [who
wants to go on being a friend of mine], [that
would block it],. (Cue)
It is plausible to assume that multiple extraposi-
tion with distinct antecedents is subject to a nest-
ing requirement: The first extraposed phrase
has to be associated with the last antecedent, the
second one to the next-to-last antecedent, etc.
Both types of constraints also apply for German,
cf. Wiltschko (1994), who provides extensive ev-
idence for the nesting requirement, including the

no traces, cf. below.

1.3 Extraposition and Fronting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.919555583333333">
The constraint of frozenness to further ex-
traction, which states that no dislocation is pos-
sible out of an extraposed phrase, is widely ac-
cepted in the literature. The contrast between (23)
and (24) illustrates this restriction:
(23) Who, did you see a picture of _, in the
newspaper?
(24)*Who2 did you see a picture in the newspaper
of _,?
Although this constraint seems to be valid for En-
glish, it is possible in German to have fronting of
material from an extraposed phrase:3
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.966579666666667">
(25) Wen, hast du geglaubt, da13 Maria
who have you believed that Maria
gekii6t hat? (Wil)

gesagt, [den er kannte]3 [da13 er gekiifit
said who he knew that he kissed
hat). (Wil)
has
On the other hand, we can also observe extrapo-
sition from fronted phrases, as (27) and (28) show
for fronted subjects and objects, respectively.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.802004">
(27) [Em n Buch _3], hat er geschrieben [das

him world-famous made has.
(28) [Em n Buch _31, war, erschienen, [das ihn
a book had appeared which him
weltberiihmt gemacht bat]3.
world-famous made has.
We find similar data with extraposition from
fronted objects in English:
(29) [Which book _,], did she write _, last year
[that takes only two hours to read]„?
(30) [Which woman _3], did he meet _, yesterday
[from the south of France]3?
Therefore, we conclude that the phrase struc-
ture for extraposition cannot involve a hierarchi-

northern variants of German.

cal constraint which states that extraposed ele-
ments are generally higher than fronted ones or
vice versa. This is confirmed by the observation
that fronted elements can be involved in multiple
extraposition as in (26). Our analysis reflects this
by avoiding the stipulation of a fixed location for
extraposition.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988167">
1.4 Islands and Boundedness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997528842105263">
Another common assumption is that extraposition
is not subject to the islands constraints that
hold for extraction to the left. The contrast be-
tween (3) and (31) makes clear that subjects are
boundaries for fronting, but not for extraposition:
(31)* [With what color hair], did a man come
into the room? (CR)
Further, the restriction of upward bounded-
ness applies to extraposition, i.e., in contrast to
fronting, extraposition may not cross the sentence
boundary:
(32) Who, did Mary say [s that John saw a pic-
ture of in the newspaper]? (CR)
(33)*It was believed [s that John saw a picture
in the newspaper by everyone] [of his
brother],. (CR)
We take both constraints as evidence that extra-
position is different from fronting and should be
handled using a separate nonlocal feature.

2.1 Nonlocal Dependencies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
We treat extraposition as a nonlocal dependency
and introduce a new nonlocal feature EXTRA to
establish the connection between an extraposed
element and its antecedent.4 A lexical rule is
employed which removes prepositional or verbal
complements from the SUBCAT list and introduces
them into the EXTRA set:

4We have to point out that the use of a nonlocal
feature is not crucial to our analysis (as extraposition
cannot cross the sentence boundary), but was chosen
for technical convenience. Defining EXTRA in this way,
we can rely on the Nonlocal Feature Principle for per-
colation; no additional mechanism is required.
5N0te that this is a recursive lexical rule, which

Note that the semantic contribution of the adjunct
(standardly dealt with by the Semantics Princi-
ple) is incorporated into this lexical rule. The shar-
ing IR states that the CONT-value of the output
is identical with the CONT of the extraposed ele-
ment, which in turn incorporates the semantics of
the input via the sharing P1.

2.2 Periphery Marking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.793735871794872">
Intuitively, our approach to the phrase structure
of extraposition can be formulated as follows:
An extraposed constituent has to be bound on
top of a phrase that introduces intervening mate-
rial between the extraposed constituent and its
antecedent.6 Since this constraint on the bind-
ing of an extraposed element is relative to its an-
tecedent, we have no fixed site for extraposition,
which explains the observed interaction between
extraposition and fronting. It also entails a nesting
requirement for multiple extraposition, as it trig-
gers distinct binding sites for extraposition from
distinct antecedents: The binding site reflects the
relative position of the antecedent. Furthermore,
we avoid spurious ambiguities which have been
problematic for previous accounts.7
Our requirement for EXTRA binding can be for-
mulated in HPSG using the notion of periphery,
which is defined for phrases containing an EXTRA
element: A phrase has a left periphery if it con-
tains an EXTRA element which is inherited from
(a) its phrasal rightmost daughter or (b) from its
lexical head. Otherwise, the phrase has a right
periphery, and EXTRA elements can be bound on
is rather unusual in standard HPSG. But cf. van No-
ord/Bouma (1994) who show some other cases where
recursive lexical rules are useful and deal with pro-
cessing issues as well.
6Our analysis is inspired by the Locality Con-
straint for Identification (LCI) which Wiltschko
(1994) proposes to account for extraposition in a GB
framework. The LCI requires that an extraposed ele-
ment is adjoined at the first maximal projection which
dominates its antecedent.
7Cf. Keller 1994, where we posited the S node as
a fixed site for the binding of extraposed elements.
Apart from leading to spurious ambiguities, this as-
sumption is incompatible with the coordination data
given in sec. 3.1.

top of it.
In case (a), no material exists to the right of the
extraposed element which could intervene between
it and an antecedent. In case (b), the EXTRA el-
ement originates directly from a lexical head and
would be indistinguishable from a non-extraposed
complement or adjunct if bound immediately. In-
tuitively, in both cases, the EXTRA element has to
be bound further up the tree after it has found
intervening material which identifies it as extra-
posed.
Our periphery definition entails that in a sentence
which contain more than one projection with a
right periphery, multiple locations for extraposi-
tion exist correspondingly. If a sentence contains
no projection with a right periphery, no extrapo-
sition is possible.
To formalize the notion of periphery, we introduce
a new feature PERIPHERY (PER), which is located
under LOCAL. Its value is of type periphery, de-
fined as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7858665">
(34) Partition of periphery: extra, non-extra
Partition of non-extra: left, right
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7407435">
The correct instantiation of PER is guaranteed by

it has a daughter D with a non-empty
INHERIEXTRA set, and D is
a. the rightmost daughter and phrasal; or
b. the head daughter and lexical and mark-
ed [PER left].
Note that (35b) allows for periphery marking to
be specified lexically. We will return to this in
sec. 2.6, where we formulate a parochial restric-
tion for German. For English, however, we assume
that all lexical entries are marked [PER left].

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999117">
2.3 Phrase Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999717846153846">
To implement the binding of extraposed elements,
we introduce an additional immediate dominance
schema, which draws on a new subtype of head-
struc called head-extra-struc bearing the feature
EXTRA- DTRS (taking a list of sign). As the binding
of extraposed elements is only possible at the right
periphery of a phrase, the head-extra schema spec-
ifies its head daughter as [PER right] and marks its
mother node as [PER extra] (the latter is needed
for the treatment of adjuncts, cf. sec. 2.5):&amp;quot;
&apos;Here loc(x) denotes a function which takes as x a
list of sign and returns a set of /oc containing the LOC
values of the elements of x.

<bodyText confidence="0.999559615384615">
Note that the specification [INHERIEXTRA { }] re-
quires all members of EXTRA to be bound at the
same level. This ensures that extraposed elements
originating from the same phrase are sisters, and
hence can be ordered by LPCs. We use LPCs to
account for multiple extraposition from the same
antecedent (cf. the data in (13)—(16)):
(36) a. H &lt;E
b. E [HEAD prep] &lt;E [HEAD verb V rel]
The constraint in (36a) orders the EXTRA-DTRS
(E) after the HEAD-DTR (H). With regard to the
EXTRA-DTRS, PPs have to precede sentences or
relative clauses, as stated in (36b).

2.5 Adjuncts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997990230769231">
The phrase structure for extraposition outlined
so far has to be constrained further, since it al-
lows adjuncts to adjoin higher than extraposed
elements, which is clearly wrong. Cf. the following
examples with extraposition from NP:
(39)*An entirely new band rings today, [several of
whom are members of the congregation] at
Great Torrington.
We conclude that the application of the head-
adjunct schema has to be disallowed on top of
a head-extra structure. This can be achieved
straightforwardly by specifying adjuncts as
[moD I LOCIPER non-extra].
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996517">
2.6 Extraposition from VP
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986582576923077">
The AELR has to be restricted language-
specifically to account corectly for extraposition
from VP:
English has a head-initial VP, therefore the right
periphery of the VP cannot be formed by the
verb, but is provided by VP adjuncts (adverbs and
PPs). As a consequence, extraposed VP adjuncts
cannot be distinguished from VP adjuncts in base
position, which is clearly undesirable. Therefore,
we restrict the AELR to nouns on the input side,
which disallows adjunct extraposition from VP
and hence avoids spurious ambiguities.
In German, in contrast, the AELR can apply
in full generality. German has a head-final VP,
which entails that a verb in final position can form
the right periphery of a phrase, making extrapo-
sition of VP adjuncts and complements possible.
We exploit of the lexical constraint in the PMC
in (35b) to allow the binding of extraposed ele-
ments on top of verbs in final position, which we
assume with Pollard (1990) to be marked [nsrv
We can therefore formulate the following lexical
requirement :9
(40) [INV --1 = [PER right]
All other lexical entries are marked [PER left], and
hence cannot introduce a right periphery.

2.7 Fronting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944857142857">
To account for the differences between English and
German concerning the fronting from extraposed
elements (cf. (24) vs. (25)) we restrict the head-
extra schema as follows:
For English we assume that both INHERISLASH
and INHERIEXTRA have to be empty for all ele-
ments of EXTRA-DTRS. This guarantees that nei-

ther fronting nor further extraposition is possible
from extraposed phrases.
For German we assume that only INHERIEXTRA
has to be empty for all elements of EXTRA-DTRS.
Therefore, fronting but not extraposition is al-
lowed from extraposed phrases.

3 Predictions and Generalizations
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999771">
3.1 Extraposition and Coordination
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978223444444444">
The head-extra schema together with the PMC
has the consequence that elements extraposed
from objects are bound at VP level, whereas extra-
position from subjects involves binding at S level,
as illustrated in (37) and (38). This is confirmed
by the following coordination data, which shows
that an element which is extraposed form the sub-
ject cannot occur at VP level:
(41) [s Nobody must live here and benefit from
income support] [who is earning more than
twenty pounds a week].
(42)* Nobody must [vp live here ][who is earn-
ing more than twenty pounds a week] and
[vP benefit from income support].
We find similar data for German, where the sub-
ject of a finite clause is related to the S projec-
tion via a SLASH dependency, and therefore the
head-extra schema applies on top of the head-filler
schema:
(43) [s, Die Behauptung iiberrraschte mich und
the claim surprised me and
erstaunte Maria], [daB Rauchen ung. ist].
puzzled Maria that smoking unh. is
(44)*Die Behauptung [s iiberrraschte mich] [daB
Rauchen ungesund ist] und [s erstaunte
Maria].
The Coordination Principle (Pollard/Sag
1994: 202) requires for coordinate structures
that the CAT and NONLOC value of each conjunct
daughter is identical to that of the mother. If we
add the assumption that the mother is always
marked as [PER right],10 then the following data
with split antecedents can be accounted for:
(45) Ein Mann auf3erte die Behauptung und eine
a man uttered the claim and a
Frau leug-nete die Tatsache daB Rauchen
woman denied the fact that smoking
ungesund ist.
unhealthy is.
Here EXTRA is shared between the conjuncts and
bound at S level. Parallel examples exist for En-
glish:
&apos;Note that this is possible as the PMC is valid only
for headed structures. We also draw on the fact that
PER is a LOCAL feature.

These data are not unexpected in our account,
since we posit no fixed position for extraposition,
and hence allow that an extraposed NP comple-

an adjunct is present to mark the right periphery
of the NP. This is the case in (47) and (48).

The contrast between (49) and (50) shows that
extraposition inside a VP is possible only if the
VP is fronted. If we assume with Nerbonne (1994)
that partial VPs exist in fronted position, but not
in the matrix clause, this contrast is readily pre-
dicted by our account. Only in fronting examples
like (49), the VP does form a separate constituent
and hence does exhibit the periphery marking
needed for extraposition.

We sum up the generalizations that are captured
by our analysis:
(a) Relative clauses, sentences, and PPs can be
extraposed, nouns and verbs can function as
antecedents. These category restrictions are
subject to crosslinguistic variation, as the the
AELR for English shows (cf. sec. 2.6).
(b) Both extraposition from fronted phrases and
fronting from extraposed elements are ac-
counted for by our head-extra schema which
is constrained by the PMC. In English,
fronting from extraposed constituents is dis-
allowed by a language-specific constraint.
(c) The PMC also entails a nesting require-
ment for extraposed elements with distinct
antecedents. Extraposed elements with the
same antecedent are bound at the same level
and LPCs apply. For English and German,
PPs have to precede sentential material. For
other languages, different orderings may be
stated.
(d) The fact that no island constraints for extra-
position exist follows from our use of EXTRA:
Island restrictions are formulated for SLASH
and hence do not apply to extraposition.
(e) The upward boundedness of extraposition
can be captured by stating that a sentence
has to be [INHERIEXTRA { }1.
Our analysis predicts the asymmetry be-
tween extraposition from subjects and ob-
jects as found e.g. in coordination data.
(g) NP-internal extraposition and extraposition
within fronted VPs are captured without the
assumption of any further mechanisms.

<abstract confidence="0.984207106571937">This paper investigates the syntax of extraposition in the HPSG framework. We present English and German data (partly taken from corpora), and provide an analysis using a nonlocal dependency and lexical rules. The condition for binding the dependency is formulated relative to the antecedent of the extraposed phrase, which entails that no fixed site for extraposition exists. Our account allows to explains the interaction of extraposition with fronting and coordination, and predicts constraints on multiple extraposition. 1 The Data Extraposition of S and In English, phrases can be extraposed, i.e., dislocated to the right boundary of a sentence. This phenomenon can be observed with adjuncts, such as relative clauses or PPs in (1)—(3), as well as with sentential and prepositional complements as (1) An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington, [several of whom are members of the congregation]. (UP) *Thanks go to Anette Frank, Tibor Kiss, Jonas Kuhn, Kai Lebeth, and Stefan Muller for comments and suggestions in connection with the research reported here. Part of the work was carried out as part of the Verbmobil Project while the author stayed at the Institute for Logic and Linguistics, IBM Germany, Heidelberg. &apos;Extraposition data was acquired from the following corpora: UPenn Treebank (UP), London- Lund Corpus (LL), Stuttgart Newspaper Corpus (STZ). Other examples were taken from Culicover/Rochemont 1990 (CR), Gueron 1980 (CR), Haider 1994 (Hai), Nerbonne 1994 (Ner), and Wiltschko 1994 (Wil). (2) Nobody must live here [who is earning more than twenty pounds a week]. (LL) (3) A man came into the room [with blond hair]. (CR) (4) There is very great public concern in Great Britain today (... ) [whether the punishments which the courts are empowered to impose are adequate]. (LL) (5) Extensive and intensive enquiries have been made [into whether this fear of this penalty in fact deters people from murdering]. (LL) (6) I don&apos;t see much argument myself any longer [against differential rents]. (LL) The antecedent (the category from which the dislocated element is extraposed) is a noun in these cases. Languages in which the right VP boundary is clearly marked (as e.g. by the non-finite verb in verb-second languages) can provide evidence for extraposition with verbal antecedents. Cf. the following German data, which include the extraposition of adjuncts in (7) and (8), and that of complements in (9) and (10). (7) In der Nacht hatte es Tote gegeben [in in the night had there victims been in Moskau (... )]. (STZ) Moscow (8) Er hat den Nerv deutscher Nachkriegshas the nerve getroffen [mit seiner Romanhistory hit with his novel Triologie (... )]. (STZ) trilogy (9) Aber es wurde offentlich aufmerksam but it was publicly attention gemacht [auf eine prekare Situation]. (STZ) called to a delicate situation (10) Er habe Schipke gesagt, [&apos;la man nicht mit he have Schipke said that one not with Eiern werfen dude, schon gar nicht auf PART den Bundeslcanzler]. (STZ) the chancellor 301 But also in English, we find evidence for extraposition from VP if we assume that adjuncts adjoin to the VP, and hence by default have to follow VP complements: (11) Florida National said yesterday [that it remains committed to the merger]. (UP) (12) Were hearing a lot these days [about selling abroad, about the importance of Britain exabroad]. 1.2 Multiple Extraposition It is possible to have more than one extraposed as shown in (13) and A man _, came in [with blond hair], [who (14) A paper _, just came out [which talks about extraposition], [which you might be interested in],. In these examples, both extraposed elements are associated with the same antecedent. We observe that the serialization for multiple extraposed elements matters for PPs, but not for relative clauses: A man _, came in [who was smiling], [with blond hair],. (16) A paper _, just came out [which you be interested [which talks about We find a different pattern for multiple extraposition involving distinct antecedents: It, struck a grammarian last month analyzed [that this clause is (Hai) It, struck a grammarian last [that this clause is grammatical], [who analyzed (Hai) No one _, puts things in the sink [that would block it]„ [who wants to go on being a friend of mine],. (Gue) one _, puts things in the sink [who wants to go on being a friend of mine], [that would block it],. (Cue) It is plausible to assume that multiple extraposiwith distinct antecedents is subject to a nestrequirement: first extraposed phrase has to be associated with the last antecedent, the second one to the next-to-last antecedent, etc. Both types of constraints also apply for German, cf. Wiltschko (1994), who provides extensive evidence for the nesting requirement, including the &apos;We use a trace-like notation to indicate the dependencies with extraposition and fronting phenomena. However, our account of extraposition involves no traces, cf. below. following data: weil das Argument _, einen Mann because the argument a man hat, [der das Fest [da13 upset has who the party visited that ungesund (Wil) smoking unhealthy is (22)*weil das Argument einen Mann aufgeregt hat, [dai3 Rauchen ungesund ist],, das Fest (Wil) 1.3 Extraposition and Fronting constraint of to further exstates that no dislocation is possible out of an extraposed phrase, is widely accepted in the literature. The contrast between (23) and (24) illustrates this restriction: (23) Who, did you see a picture of _, in the newspaper? did you see a picture in the newspaper of _,? Although this constraint seems to be valid for English, it is possible in German to have fronting of from an extraposed (25) Wen, hast du geglaubt, da13 Maria who have you believed that Maria gekii6t hat? (Wil) kissed has [Die hat Peter einem Mann the Maria has Peter to-a man [den er [da13 er gekiifit said who he knew that he kissed hat). (Wil) has On the other hand, we can also observe extraposition from fronted phrases, as (27) and (28) show for fronted subjects and objects, respectively. [Em n Buch hat er geschrieben [das has he written which weltberiihmt gemacht him world-famous made has. [Em n Buch war, erschienen, [das ihn a book had appeared which him gemacht world-famous made has. find data with extraposition from fronted objects in English: (29) [Which book _,], did she write _, last year [that takes only two hours to read]„? [Which woman did he meet _, yesterday the south of Therefore, we conclude that the phrase strucfor extraposition cannot involve a hierarchi- &apos;These examples are less acceptable to speakers of northern variants of German. 302 cal constraint which states that extraposed elements are generally higher than fronted ones or vice versa. This is confirmed by the observation that fronted elements can be involved in multiple extraposition as in (26). Our analysis reflects this by avoiding the stipulation of a fixed location for extraposition. 1.4 Islands and Boundedness Another common assumption is that extraposition not subject to the constraints hold for extraction to the left. The contrast between (3) and (31) makes clear that subjects are boundaries for fronting, but not for extraposition: (31)* [With what color hair], did a man come into the room? (CR) the restriction of boundedto extraposition, i.e., in contrast to fronting, extraposition may not cross the sentence boundary: (32) Who, did Mary say [s that John saw a picture of in the newspaper]? (CR) (33)*It was believed [s that John saw a picture in the newspaper by everyone] [of his brother],. (CR) We take both constraints as evidence that extraposition is different from fronting and should be handled using a separate nonlocal feature. 2 An HPSG Account 2.1 Nonlocal Dependencies We treat extraposition as a nonlocal dependency introduce a new nonlocal feature establish the connection between an extraposed and its A lexical rule is employed which removes prepositional or verbal from the and introduces into the Complement Extraposition Lexical Rule (CELR) A similar rule is used to introduce adjuncts into to point out that the use of a nonlocal feature is not crucial to our analysis (as extraposition cannot cross the sentence boundary), but was chosen technical convenience. Defining this way, we can rely on the Nonlocal Feature Principle for percolation; no additional mechanism is required. that this is a recursive lexical rule, which Adjunct Extraposition Lexical Rule (AELR) Igl ICATIHEAD noun Vverb NONLOCIINHERIEXTRA LOCICONT [HD prep rel[MODILOC 111]] SUBCAT Com,) Note that the semantic contribution of the adjunct (standardly dealt with by the Semantics Principle) is incorporated into this lexical rule. The sharing IR states that the CONT-value of the output identical with the the extraposed element, which in turn incorporates the semantics of the input via the sharing P1. 2.2 Periphery Marking Intuitively, our approach to the phrase structure of extraposition can be formulated as follows: An extraposed constituent has to be bound on top of a phrase that introduces intervening material between the extraposed constituent and its Since this constraint on the binding of an extraposed element is relative to its antecedent, we have no fixed site for extraposition, which explains the observed interaction between extraposition and fronting. It also entails a nesting requirement for multiple extraposition, as it triggers distinct binding sites for extraposition from distinct antecedents: The binding site reflects the relative position of the antecedent. Furthermore, we avoid spurious ambiguities which have been for previous requirement for can be forin HPSG using the notion of is defined for phrases containing an A phrase has a if it conan which is inherited from (a) its phrasal rightmost daughter or (b) from its head. Otherwise, the phrase has a and can be bound on is rather unusual in standard HPSG. But cf. van No- (1994) who show other cases where recursive lexical rules are useful and deal with processing issues as well. analysis is inspired by the Locality Constraint for Identification (LCI) which Wiltschko (1994) proposes to account for extraposition in a GB framework. The LCI requires that an extraposed element is adjoined at the first maximal projection which dominates its antecedent. Keller 1994, where we posited the S node as a fixed site for the binding of extraposed elements. Apart from leading to spurious ambiguities, this assumption is incompatible with the coordination data given in sec. 3.1. 0 ED ( [LOC ( ) verb NONLOCIINHERIEXTRA P2 Li{ El }I u 303 top of it. In case (a), no material exists to the right of the extraposed element which could intervene between it and an antecedent. In case (b), the EXTRA element originates directly from a lexical head and would be indistinguishable from a non-extraposed complement or adjunct if bound immediately. Intuitively, in both cases, the EXTRA element has to be bound further up the tree after it has found intervening material which identifies it as extraposed. Our periphery definition entails that in a sentence which contain more than one projection with a right periphery, multiple locations for extraposition exist correspondingly. If a sentence contains no projection with a right periphery, no extraposition is possible. To formalize the notion of periphery, we introduce a new feature PERIPHERY (PER), which is located LOCAL. Its value is of type defined as follows: Partition of extra, non-extra of left, right The correct instantiation of PER is guaranteed by the following condition: (35) Periphery Marking Condition (PMC) headed phrase is marked [PER has a daughter a non-empty set, and a. the rightmost daughter and phrasal; or the head daughter and lexical and mark- [PER Note that (35b) allows for periphery marking to be specified lexically. We will return to this in sec. 2.6, where we formulate a parochial restriction for German. For English, however, we assume all lexical entries are marked [PER Structure To implement the binding of extraposed elements, we introduce an additional immediate dominance which draws on a new subtype of headthe feature DTRS (taking a list of the binding of extraposed elements is only possible at the right periphery of a phrase, the head-extra schema specits head daughter as [PER marks its node as [PER latter is needed for the treatment of adjuncts, cf. sec. 2.5):&amp;quot; denotes a function which takes as of returns a set of the of the elements of Head-Extra Schema SYNSEM NONLOCIINHERIEXTRA { } LOCIPER I DTRS NLOCITO-BIEXTRA loc( Note that the specification [INHERIEXTRA { }] requires all members of EXTRA to be bound at the same level. This ensures that extraposed elements originating from the same phrase are sisters, and hence can be ordered by LPCs. We use LPCs to account for multiple extraposition from the same antecedent (cf. the data in (13)—(16)): (36) a. H &lt;E E [HEAD [HEAD V rel] The constraint in (36a) orders the EXTRA-DTRS after the HEAD-DTR regard to the EXTRA-DTRS, PPs have to precede sentences or relative clauses, as stated in (36b). 2.4 Examples The (simplified) tree structures for (6) and (3) are given in (37) and (38): (37) VP [PER I In PP vp[PER I AP against DR any longer INHIEX In 1 see no argument S [PER I } a man came into the room II [mon El with red hair 304 2.5 Adjuncts The phrase structure for extraposition outlined so far has to be constrained further, since it allows adjuncts to adjoin higher than extraposed elements, which is clearly wrong. Cf. the following examples with extraposition from NP: (39)*An entirely new band rings today, [several of whom are members of the congregation] at Great Torrington. We conclude that the application of the headadjunct schema has to be disallowed on top of a head-extra structure. This can be achieved straightforwardly by specifying adjuncts as I LOCIPER 2.6 Extraposition from VP The AELR has to be restricted languagespecifically to account corectly for extraposition from VP: a head-initial VP, therefore the right periphery of the VP cannot be formed by the verb, but is provided by VP adjuncts (adverbs and PPs). As a consequence, extraposed VP adjuncts cannot be distinguished from VP adjuncts in base position, which is clearly undesirable. Therefore, we restrict the AELR to nouns on the input side, which disallows adjunct extraposition from VP and hence avoids spurious ambiguities. contrast, the AELR can apply in full generality. German has a head-final VP, which entails that a verb in final position can form the right periphery of a phrase, making extraposition of VP adjuncts and complements possible. We exploit of the lexical constraint in the PMC in (35b) to allow the binding of extraposed elements on top of verbs in final position, which we assume with Pollard (1990) to be marked [nsrv We can therefore formulate the following lexical [INV = other lexical entries are marked [PER hence cannot introduce a right periphery. 2.7 Fronting To account for the differences between English and German concerning the fronting from extraposed elements (cf. (24) vs. (25)) we restrict the headextra schema as follows: assume that both INHERISLASH and INHERIEXTRA have to be empty for all eleof EXTRA-DTRS. This guarantees that neisimilar has to be formulated for verbs with separable prefixes, where the prefix marks the right periphery. ther fronting nor further extraposition is possible from extraposed phrases. assume that only INHERIEXTRA has to be empty for all elements of EXTRA-DTRS. Therefore, fronting but not extraposition is allowed from extraposed phrases. 3 Predictions and Generalizations 3.1 Extraposition and Coordination The head-extra schema together with the PMC has the consequence that elements extraposed from objects are bound at VP level, whereas extraposition from subjects involves binding at S level, as illustrated in (37) and (38). This is confirmed by the following coordination data, which shows that an element which is extraposed form the subject cannot occur at VP level: (41) [s Nobody must live here and benefit from income support] [who is earning more than twenty pounds a week]. (42)* Nobody must [vp live here ][who is earning more than twenty pounds a week] and [vP benefit from income support]. We find similar data for German, where the subject of a finite clause is related to the S projection via a SLASH dependency, and therefore the head-extra schema applies on top of the head-filler schema: (43) [s, Die Behauptung iiberrraschte mich und the claim surprised me and erstaunte Maria], [daB Rauchen ung. ist]. puzzled Maria that smoking unh. is (44)*Die Behauptung [s iiberrraschte mich] [daB Rauchen ungesund ist] und [s erstaunte Maria]. The Coordination Principle (Pollard/Sag 1994: 202) requires for coordinate structures the of each conjunct daughter is identical to that of the mother. If we add the assumption that the mother is always as then the following data with split antecedents can be accounted for: (45) Ein Mann auf3erte die Behauptung und eine man the claim and a die Tatsache daB Rauchen denied the that smoking ungesund ist. unhealthy is. Here EXTRA is shared between the conjuncts and bound at S level. Parallel examples exist for English: this is possible as the PMC is valid only for headed structures. We also draw on the fact that a 305 (46) A man came in and a woman went out who knew each other well. (CR) Extraposition We also find evidence for extraposed phases within NPs, i.e., examples in which adjuncts precede complements: In [NPan interview [published yesterday] [with the Los Angeles Daily News]), Mr. Simmons said: &amp;quot;Lockheed is actually just a decoy. (... )&amp;quot; (UP) &amp;quot;The question&amp;quot; at [NPa closed-door meeting [K mart is scheduled to hold today] [with analysts]] &amp;quot;will be: Why aren&apos;t we seeing better improvement in sales?&amp;quot; (UP) These data are not unexpected in our account, since we posit no fixed position for extraposition, and hence allow that an extraposed NP complement is bound inside the NP itself, provided that an adjunct is present to mark the right periphery of the NP. This is the case in (47) and (48). Extraposition Much in the same vein as with NP-internal extraposition, our account accommodates cases of VP-internal extraposition, which are possible with fronted partial VPs in German: (49) [vp [Einen Hund fiittern], [der Hunger hat]], a dog feed which hunger has wird wohl jeder diirfen. (Ner) (50)* Es wird wohl jeder [vp [einen Hund fiittern], der Hunger hat], diirfen. (Ner) The contrast between (49) and (50) shows that extraposition inside a VP is possible only if the VP is fronted. If we assume with Nerbonne (1994) that partial VPs exist in fronted position, but not in the matrix clause, this contrast is readily predicted by our account. Only in fronting examples like (49), the VP does form a separate constituent and hence does exhibit the periphery marking needed for extraposition. 3.4 Generalizations We sum up the generalizations that are captured by our analysis: (a) Relative clauses, sentences, and PPs can be extraposed, nouns and verbs can function as antecedents. These category restrictions are subject to crosslinguistic variation, as the the AELR for English shows (cf. sec. 2.6). (b) Both extraposition from fronted phrases and from extraposed elements are accounted for by our head-extra schema which is constrained by the PMC. In English, fronting from extraposed constituents is disallowed by a language-specific constraint. (c) The PMC also entails a nesting requirement for extraposed elements with distinct antecedents. Extraposed elements with the same antecedent are bound at the same level and LPCs apply. For English and German, PPs have to precede sentential material. For other languages, different orderings may be stated. (d) The fact that no island constraints for extraexist follows from our use of restrictions are formulated for and hence do not apply to extraposition. (e) The upward boundedness of extraposition can be captured by stating that a sentence to be Our analysis predicts the asymmetry between extraposition from subjects and objects as found e.g. in coordination data. extraposition and extraposition within fronted VPs are captured without the assumption of any further mechanisms.</abstract>

This is the case in (47) and (48). 3.3 VP-internal Extraposition Much in the same vein as with NP-internal extraposition, our account accommodates cases of VP-internal extraposition, which are possible with fronted partial VPs in German: (49) [vp [Einen Hund fiittern], [der Hunger hat]], a dog feed which hunger has wird wohl jeder diirfen. (Ner) will PART everyone be-allowed (50)* Es wird wohl jeder [vp [einen Hund fiittern], der Hunger hat], diirfen. (Ner) The contrast between (49) and (50) shows that extraposition inside a VP is possible only if the VP is fronted. If we assume with Nerbonne (1994) that partial VPs exist in fronted position, but not in the matrix clause, this contrast is readily predicted by our account. Only in fronting examples like (49), the VP does form a separate constituent and hence does exhibit the periphery marking needed for extraposition. 3.4 Generalizations We sum up the generalizations that are captured by our analysis: (a) Relative clauses, sentences, and PPs can be extraposed, nouns and verbs can function as antecedents. These category restrictions are subject to crosslinguistic variation, as the the AELR for English shows (cf. sec. 2.6). (b) Both extrapo</context>

Therefore, we restrict the AELR to nouns on the input side, which disallows adjunct extraposition from VP and hence avoids spurious ambiguities. In German, in contrast, the AELR can apply in full generality. German has a head-final VP, which entails that a verb in final position can form the right periphery of a phrase, making extraposition of VP adjuncts and complements possible. We exploit of the lexical constraint in the PMC in (35b) to allow the binding of extraposed elements on top of verbs in final position, which we assume with Pollard (1990) to be marked [nsrv We can therefore formulate the following lexical requirement :9 (40) [INV --1 = [PER right] All other lexical entries are marked [PER left], and hence cannot introduce a right periphery. 2.7 Fronting To account for the differences between English and German concerning the fronting from extraposed elements (cf. (24) vs. (25)) we restrict the headextra schema as follows: For English we assume that both INHERISLASH and INHERIEXTRA have to be empty for all elements of EXTRA-DTRS. This guarantees that nei9A similar rule has to be formulated for verbs with separable prefixes, whe</context>
