We present a series of studies of affirmative cue words—a family of cue words such as “okay” or
“alright&amp;quot; that speakers use frequently in conversation. These words pose a challenge for spoken
dialogue systems because of their ambiguity: They may be used for agreeing with what the in-
terlocutor has said, indicating continued attention, or for cueing the start of a new topic, among
other meanings. We describe differences in the acoustic/prosodic realization of such functions in
a corpus of spontaneous, task-oriented dialogues in Standard American English. These results
are important both for interpretation and for production in spoken language applications. We
also assess the predictive power of computational methods for the automatic disambiguation of
these words. We find that contextual information and final intonation figure as the most salient
cues to automatic disambiguation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999260636363636">
CUE PHRASES are linguistic expressions that may be used to convey explicit information
about the discourse or dialogue, or to convey a more literal, semantic contribution.
They aid speakers and writers in organizing the discourse, and listeners and readers in
processing it. In previous literature, these constructions have also been termed discourse
markers, pragmatic connectives, discourse operators, and clue words. Examples of cue
phrases include now, well, so, and, but, then, after all, furthermore, however, in consequence,
as a matter offact, in fact, actually, okay, alright, for example, and incidentally.
The ability to correctly determine the function of cue phrases is critical for important
natural language processing tasks, including anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner
1986), argument understanding (Cohen 1984), plan recognition (Grosz and Sidner 1986;
Litman and Allen 1987), and discourse segmentation (Litman and Passonneau 1995).

Furthermore, correctly determining the function of cue phrases using features of the
surrounding text can be used to improve the naturalness of synthetic speech in text-to-
speech systems (Hirschberg 1990).
In this study, we focus on a subclass of cue phrases that we term affirmative
cue words (hereafter, ACWs), and that include alright, mm-hm, okay, right, and
uh-huh, inter alia. These words are frequent in spontaneous conversation, especially in
task-oriented dialogue, and are heavily overloaded: Their possible discourse/pragmatic
functions include agreeing with what the interlocutor has said, displaying interest and
continued attention, and cueing the start of a new topic. Some ACWs (e.g., alright, okay)
are capable of conveying as many as ten different functions, as described in Section 3.
Whereas ACWs thus form a subset of more general classes of utterances which have
been studied in more general studies of cue words, cue phrases, discourse markers, feedback
utterances, linguistic feedback, acknowledgments, grounding acts, our focus is on this par-
ticular subset of lexical items which may convey an affirmative response—but which
may also convey many different meanings. The disambiguation of these meanings we
believe is critical to the success of spoken dialogue systems.
In the studies presented here, our goal is to extend our understanding of ACWs,
in particular by finding descriptions of the acoustic/prosodic characteristics of their
different functions, and by assessing the predictive power of computational methods for
their automatic disambiguation. This knowledge should be helpful in spoken language
generation and understanding tasks, including interactive spoken dialogue systems and
applications doing off-line analyses of conversational data, such as meeting segmenta-
tion and summarization. For example, spoken dialogue systems lacking a model of the
appropriate realization of different uses of these words are likely to have difficulty in
understanding and communicating with their users, either by producing cue phrases
in a way that does not convey the intended meaning or by misunderstanding users’
productions.
This article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews previous literature. In Sec-
tion 3 we describe the materials used in the present study from the Columbia Games
Corpus. Section 4 presents a statistical description of the acoustic, prosodic, and con-
textual characteristics of the functions of ACWs in this corpus. In Section 5 we describe
results from a number of machine learning experiments aimed at investigating how
accurately ACWs may be automatically classified into their various functions. Finally,
in Section 6 we summarize and discuss our main findings.

2. Previous Work

Cue phrases have received extensive attention in the computational linguistics litera-
ture. Early work by Cohen (1984) presents a computational justification for the impor-
tance of cue phrases in discourse processing. Using a simple propositional framework
for analyzing discourse, Cohen claims that, in some cases, cue phrases decrease the
number of operations required by the listener to process “coherent transmissions”; in
other cases, cue phrases are necessary to allow the recognition of “transmissions which
would be incoherent (too complex to reconstruct) in the absence of clues” (page 251).
Reichman (1985) proposes a model of discourse structure in which discourse com-
prises a collection of basic constituents called context spaces, organized hierarchically
according to semantic and logical relations called conversational moves. In Reichman’s
model, cue phrases are portrayed as mechanisms that signal context space boundaries,
specifying the kind of conversational move about to take place. Grosz and Sidner (1986)
introduce an alternative model of discourse structure formed by three interrelated

components: a linguistic structure, an intentional structure, and an attentional state. In
this model, cue phrases play a central role, allowing the speaker to provide information
about all of the following to the listener:
1) that a change of attention is imminent; 2) whether the change returns to a previous
focus space or creates a new one; 3) how the intention is related to other intentions;
4) what precedence relationships, if any, are relevant (page 196).
In a corpus study of spontaneous conversations, Schiffrin (1987) describes cue phrases
as syntactically detachable from a sentence, commonly used in initial position within
utterances, capable of operating at both local and global levels of discourse, and having
a range of prosodic contours. As other authors, Schiffrin observes that cue phrases
provide contextual coordinates for an utterance in the discourse—that is, they indicate
the discourse segment to which an utterance belongs. However, she suggests that cue
phrases only display discourse structure relations; they do not create them. In a critique
of Schiffrin’s work, Redeker (1991) proposes defining cue phrases as phrases “uttered
with the primary function of bringing to the listener’s attention a particular kind of
linkage of the upcoming utterance with the immediate discourse context” (page 1169).
Prior work on the automatic classification of cue phrases includes a series of studies
performed by Hirschberg and Litman (Hirschberg and Litman 1987, 1993; Litman and
Hirschberg 1990), which focus on differentiating between the discourse and sentential
senses of single-word cue phrases such as now, well, okay, say, and so in American
English. When used in a discourse sense, a cue phrase explicitly conveys information
about the discourse structure; when used in a sentential sense, a cue phrase instead
conveys semantic information. Hirschberg and Litman present two manually devel-
oped classification models, one based on prosodic features, and one based on textual
features. This line of research is further pursued by Litman (1994, 1996), who incorpo-
rates machine learning techniques to derive classification models automatically. Litman
uses different combinations of prosodic and text-based features to train decision-tree
and rule learners, and shows that machine learning constitutes a powerful tool for
developing automatic classifiers of cue phrases into their sentential and discourse uses.
Zufferey and Popescu-Belis (2004) present a similar study on the automatic classification
of like and well into discourse and sentential senses, achieving a performance close to
that of human annotators.
Besides the binary division of cue phrases into discourse vs. sentential meanings,
the Conversational Analysis (CA) literature describes items it terms linguistic feedback
or acknowledgments. These include not only the computational linguists’ cue phrases
but also expressions such as I see or oh wow, which CA research describes in terms of
attention, understanding, and acceptance by the speaker of a proposition uttered by
another conversation participant (Kendon 1967; Yngve 1970; Duncan 1972; Schegloff
1982; Jefferson 1984). Such items typically occur at the second position in common
adjacency pairs and include backchannels (also referred to as continuers), which
“exhibit on the part of [their] producer an understanding that an extended unit of talk
is underway by another, and that it is not yet, or may not be (even ought not yet be)
complete; [they take] the stance that the speaker of that extended unit should continue
talking” (Schegloff 1982, page 81), and agreements, which indicate the speaker’s
agreement with a statement or opinion expressed by another speaker. Allwood,
Nivre, and Ahlsen (1992) distinguish four basic communicative functions of linguistic
feedback which enable conversational partners to exchange information: contact,
perception, understanding, and attitudinal reactions. These correspond respectively

to whether the interlocutor is willing and able to continue the interaction, perceive the
message, understand the message, and react and respond to the message. Allwood,
Nivre, and Ahlsen posit that “simple feedback words, like yes, [...] involve a high
degree of context dependence” (page 5), and suggest that their basic communicative
function strongly depends on the type of speech act, factual polarity, and information
status of the immediately preceding communicative act. Novick and Sutton (1994)
propose an alternative categorization of linguistic feedback in task-oriented dialogue,
which is based on the structural context of exchanges rather than on the characteristics
of the preceding utterance. The three main classes in Novick and Sutton’s catalogue
are: (i) other → ackn, where an acknowledgment immediately follows a contribution by
other speaker; (ii) self → other → ackn, where self initiates an exchange, other eventually
completes it, and self utters an acknowledgment; and (iii) self + ackn, where self includes
an acknowledgment in an utterance independently of other’s previous contribution.
Substantial attention has been paid to subsets and supersets of words we include
in our class of ACWs in the psycholinguistic literature in studies of grounding—
the process by which conversants obtain and maintain a common ground of mutual
knowledge, mutual beliefs, and mutual assumptions over the course of a conversation
(Clark and Schaefer 1989; Clark and Brennan 1991). Computational work on grounding
has been pursued for a number of years by Traum and colleagues (e.g., Traum and Allen
1992; Traum 1994), who recently have described a corpus-based study of lexical and
semantic evidence supporting different degrees of grounding (Roque and Traum 2009).
Our ACWs often occur in the process of establishing such common ground.
Prosodic characteristics of the responses involved in grounding have been studied in
the Australian English Map Task corpus by Mushin et al. (2003), who find that these
utterances often consist of acknowledgment contributions such as okay or yeh produced
with a “non-final” intonational contour, and followed by speech by the same speaker
which appears to continue the intonational phrase. Studies by Walker of informa-
tionally redundant utterances (IRUs) (Walker 1992, 1996), utterances which express
“a proposition already entailed, presupposed or implicated by a previous utterance
in the same discourse situation” (Walker 1993a, page 12), also include some of our
ACWs, such as IRU prompts (e.g., uh-huh), which, according to Walker, “add no new
propositional content to the common ground” (Walker 1993a, page 32). Walker adopts
the term “continuer” from the Conversational Analysis school to further describe these
prompts (Walker 1993a). Walker describes some intonational contours which are used
to realize IRUs in generation in Walker (1993a) and in Walker (1993b), examining 63 IRU
tokens and finding five different types of contour used among them.
As part of a larger project on automatically detecting discourse structure for speech
recognition and understanding tasks in American English, Jurafsky et al. (1998) present
a study of four particular discourse/pragmatic functions, or dialog acts (Bunt 1989;
Core and Allen 1997), closely related to ACWs: backchannel, agreement, incipient
speakership (indicating an intention to take the floor), and yes-answer (affirmative
answer to a yes–no question). The authors examine 1,155 conversations from the Switch-
board database (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel 1992), and report that the vast ma-
jority of these four dialogue acts are realized with words like yeah, okay, or uh-huh. They
find that the lexical realization of the dialogue act is the strongest cue to its identity (e.g.,
backchannel is the preferred function for uh-huh and mm-hm), and report preliminary
results on some prosodic differences across dialogue acts: Backchannels are shorter in
duration, have lower pitch and intensity, and are more likely to end in a rising intonation
than agreements. Two related studies, part of the same project, address the automatic
classification of dialogue acts in conversational speech (Shriberg et al. 1998; Stolcke

et al. 2000). The results of their machine learning experiments, conducted on the same
subset of Switchboard used previously, indicate a high degree of confusion between
agreements and backchannels, because both classes share words such as yeah and right.
They also show that prosodic features (including duration, pause, and intensity) can aid
the automatic disambiguation between these two classes: A classifier trained using both
lexical and prosodic features slightly yet significantly outperforms one trained using
just lexical features.
There is also considerable evidence that linguistic feedback does not take place
at arbitrary locations in conversation; rather, it mostly occurs at or near transition-
relevance places for turn-taking (Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974; Goodwin 1981).
Ward and Tsukahara (2000) describe, in both Japanese and American English, a region
of low pitch lasting at least 110 msec which may function as a prosodic cue inviting
the realization of a backchannel response from the interlocutor. In a corpus study
of Japanese dialogues, Koiso et al. (1998) find that both syntax and prosody play a
central role in predicting the occurrence of backchannels. Cathcart, Carletta, and Klein
(2003) propose a method for automatically predicting the placement of backchannels
in Scottish English conversation, based on pause durations and part-of-speech tags,
that outperforms a random baseline model. Recently, Gravano and Hirschberg (2009a,
2009b, 2011) describe six distinct prosodic, acoustic, and lexical events in American
English speech that tend to precede the occurrence of a backchannel by the interlocutor.
Despite their high frequency in spontaneous conversation, the set of ACWs we
examine here have seldom, if ever, been an object of study in themselves, as a separate
subclass of cue phrases or dialogue acts. Some have attempted to model other types
of cue phrases (e.g., well, like) or cue phrases in general; others discuss discourse/
pragmatic functions that may be conveyed through ACWs, but which may also be
conveyed through other types of expressions (e.g., agreements may be communicated
by single words such as yes or longer cue phrases such as that’s correct). Subsets of ACWs
have been studied in very small corpora, with some proposals about their prosodic
and functional variations. For example, Hockey (1993) examines the prosodic variation
of two ACWs, okay and uh-huh (66 and 77 data points, respectively) produced as full
intonational phrases in two spontaneous task-oriented dialogues. She groups the F0
contours visually and auditorily, and shows that instances of okay produced with a
high-rise contour are significantly more likely to be followed by speech from the other
speaker than from the same speaker. The results of a perception experiment conducted
by Gravano et al. (2007) suggest that, in task-oriented American English dialogue,
contextual information (e.g., duration of surrounding silence, number of surrounding
words) as well as word-final intonation figure as the most salient cues to disambiguation
of the function of the word okay by human listeners. Also, in a study of the function of
intonation in Scottish English task-oriented dialogue, Kowtko (1996) examines a corpus
of 273 instances of single-word utterances, including affirmative cue words such as mm-
hm, okay, right, uh-huh, and yes. Kowtko finds a significant correlation between discourse
function and intonational contour: The align function (which checks that the listener’s
understanding aligns with that of the speaker) is shown to correlate with rising in-
tonational contours; the ready function (which cues the speaker’s intention to begin
a new task) and the reply-y function (which “has an affirmative surface and usually
indicates agreement”; Kowtko 1996, page 59) correlate with a non-rising intonation;
and the acknowledge function (which indicates having heard and understood) presents
all types of final intonation. It is important to note, however, that different dialects
and different languages have distinct ways of realizing different discourse/pragmatic
functions, so it is unclear how useful these results are for American English.

Although broader studies focusing on the pragmatic function of cue phrases, dis-
course markers, linguistic feedback, and dialogue acts do shed light on the particular
subset of utterances we are studying, and although there is some information on par-
ticular lexical items we include here in our study, the class of ACWs itself has received
little attention. Particularly given the frequency of ACWs in dialogue, it is important
to identify reliable and automatically extractable cues to their disambiguation, so that
spoken dialogue systems can recognize the pragmatic function of ACWs in user input
and can produce ACWs that are less likely to be misinterpreted in system output.

3. Materials
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999845625">
The materials for all experiments in this study were taken from the Columbia Games
Corpus, a collection of 12 spontaneous task-oriented dyadic conversations elicited from
13 native speakers (6 female, 7 male) of Standard American English (SAE). A detailed
description of this corpus is given in Appendix A. In each session, two subjects were
paid to play a series of computer games requiring verbal communication to achieve
joint goals of identifying and moving images on the screen. Each subject used a separate
laptop computer; they sat facing each other in a soundproof booth, with an opaque
curtain hanging between to allow only verbal communication.
Each session contains an average of 45 minutes of dialogue, totaling roughly 9 hours
of dialogue in the corpus. Trained annotators orthographically transcribed the re-
cordings and manually aligned the words to the speech signal, yielding a total of
70,259 words and 2,037 unique words in the corpus. Additionally, self repairs and
certain non-word vocalizations were marked, including laughs, coughs, and breaths.
For roughly two thirds of the corpus, intonational patterns and other aspects of the
prosody were identified by trained annotators using the ToBI transcription framework
(Beckman and Hirschberg 1994; Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg 1994).

3.1 Affirmative Cue Words in the Games Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.77107305">
Throughout the Games Corpus, subjects made frequent use of affirmative cue words:
The 5,456 instances of affirmative cue words alright, gotcha, huh, mm-hm, okay, right,
uh-huh, yeah, yep, yes, and yup account for 7.8% of the total words in the corpus. Because
the usage of these words seems to vary significantly in meaning, we asked three labelers
to independently classify all occurrences of these 11 words in the entire corpus into the
ten discourse/pragmatic functions listed in Table 1.
Among the distinctions we make in these pragmatic functions, we note particularly
that our categories of Agr and BC differ primarily in that Agr is defined as indicating
belief in or agreement with the interlocutor (e.g., a response to a yes–no question),
whereas BC indicates only continued attention.1
1 Our definition of BC is similar to definitions of backchannel and continuer as discussed by a number
of authors in the Conversational Analysis and spoken language processing communities (e.g.,
Stolcke et al.’s [2000] “a short utterance that plays discourse structuring roles, e.g., indicating that the
speaker should go on talking” [page 345]; and Cathcart et al.’s [2003] “utterances, with minimal content,
used to clearly signal that the speaker should continue with her current turn” [page 51]). Although some
definitions of BC also include the notion that the speaker is indicating understanding, we did not ask
annotators to make this distinction. We note further that, although it is also possible (cf. Clark and
Schaefer 1989) to signal understanding without agreement, in the process of designing the labeling
scheme we did not find instances of ACWs that seemed to us to have this function in our corpus; nor
did our labelers find such cases. Hence we did not include this distinction among our classes.

3.2 Data Downsampling

<bodyText confidence="0.999812166666667">
Some of the word/function pairs in Table 2 are skewed to contributions from a few
speakers. For example, for backchannel (BC) uh-huh, as many as 65 instances (44%) are
from one single speaker, and the remaining 83 are from seven other speakers. In cases
like this, using the whole sample would pose the risk of drawing false conclusions on
the usage of ACWs, possibly influenced by stylistic properties of individual speakers.
Therefore, we downsampled the tokens of ACWs in the Games Corpus to obtain a
balanced data set, with instances of each word and function coming in similar propor-
tions from as many speakers as possible. Specifically, we downsampled our data using
the following procedure: First, we discarded all word/function pairs with tokens from
fewer than four different speakers; second, for each of the remaining word/function
pairs, we discarded tokens (at random) from speakers who contributed more than 25%
of its tokens. In other words, the resulting data set meets two conditions: For each word/

Our lexical features consist of the lexical identity and the part-of-speech (POS) tag
of the target word (w), the word immediately preceding w, and the word immediately
following w (see Table 4). POS tags were labeled automatically for the whole corpus
using Ratnaparkhi, Brill, and Church’s (1996) maxent tagger trained on a subset of the
Switchboard corpus (Charniak and Johnson 2001) in lower-case with all punctuation
removed, to simulate spoken language transcripts. Each word had an associated POS
tag from the full Penn Treebank tag set (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini 1993),
and one of the following simplified tags: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, contraction,
or other.
For our discourse features, listed in Table 4, we define an inter-pausal unit (IPU) as
a maximal sequence of words surrounded by silence longer than 50 msec. A turn is a
maximal sequence of IPUs from one speaker, such that between any two adjacent IPUs
there is no speech from the interlocutor.3,4 Boundaries of IPUs and turns are computed
automatically from the time-aligned transcriptions. A task in the Games Corpus cor-
responds to a simple game played by the subjects, requiring verbal communication to
achieve a joint goal of identifying and moving images on the screen (see Appendix A for
a description of these game tasks). Task boundaries are extracted from the logs collected
automatically during the sessions, and subsequently checked by hand. Our discourse
features are intended to capture discrete positional information of the target word, in
relation to its containing IPU, turn, and task.

3 Here “between” refers strictly to the time after the end point of the former IPU and before the start point

4 Note that our operational definition of “turn” here includes all speaker utterances, including
backchannels, which are typically not counted as turn-taking behaviors. We use this more inclusive
definition of “turn” here to avoid inventing a new term to encompass “turns and backchannels”.

Our timing features (Table 5) are intended to capture positional information of a
temporal nature, such as the duration (in milliseconds) of w and its containing IPU
and turn, or the duration of any silence before and after w. These features also contain
information about the target word relative to the other speaker’s speech, including the
duration of any overlapping speech, and the latencies between w’s conversational turn
and the other speaker’s preceding and subsequent turns.
Prosody was annotated following the ToBI system (Beckman and Hirschberg 1994;
Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg 1994), which consists of annotations at four time-
linked levels of analysis: an orthographic tier of time-aligned words; a tonal tier describing
targets in the fundamental frequency (F0) contour; a break index tier indicating degrees
of juncture between words; and a miscellaneous tier, in which phenomena such as
disfluencies may be optionally marked. The tonal tier describes events such as pitch
accents, which make words intonationally prominent and are realized by increased F0
height, loudness, and duration of accented syllables. A given word may be accented
or not and, if accented, may bear different tones, or different degrees of prominence,
with respect to other words. Five types of pitch accent are distinguished in the ToBI
system for American English: two simple accents H* and L*, and three complex ones,
L*+H, L+H*, and H+!H*. An L indicates a low tone and an H, a high tone; the
asterisk indicates which tone of the accent is aligned with the stressable syllable of
the lexical item bearing the accent. Some pitch accents may be downstepped, such that
the pitch range of the accent is compressed in comparison to a non-downstepped accent.
Downsteps are indicated by the ‘!’ diacritic (e.g., !H*, L+!H*). Break indices define two
levels of phrasing: Level 3 corresponds to Pierrehumbert’s (1980) intermediate phrase
and level 4 to Pierrehumbert’s intonational phrase. Level 4 phrases consist of one or
more level 3 phrases, plus a high or low boundary tone (H% or L%) indicated in the
tonal tier at the right edge of the phrase. Level 3 phrases consist of one or more pitch
accents, aligned with the stressed syllable of lexical items, plus a phrase accent, which
also may be high (H-) or low (L-). For example, a standard declarative contour consists

of a sequence of H* pitch accents ending in a low phrase accent and low boundary
tone (L-L%); likewise, a standard yes–no question contour consists of a sequence of L*
pitch accents ending in H-H%. These are illustrated in Figure 1. In our study, prosodic
features include the ToBI labels as specified by the annotators, and also a simplified
version of the labels, considering only high and low pitch targets (i.e., H* vs. L* for
pitch accents, H- vs. L- for phrase accents, and H% vs. L% for boundary tones), and
simplified break indices (0–4). These are listed in Table 6.
All acoustic features were extracted automatically for the whole corpus using the
Praat toolkit (Boersma and Weenink 2001). These include pitch, intensity, stylized pitch,
ratio of voiced frames to total frames, jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonics ratio
(NHR) (see Table 7). Pitch features capture how high the speaker’s voice sounds or how
low. Intensity is correlated with how loud the speaker sounds to a hearer. The voiced-
frames ratio roughly approximates the speaking rate. Jitter and shimmer correspond to
variability in the frequency and amplitude of vocal-fold vibration, respectively. NHR
is the energy ratio of noise to harmonic components in the voiced speech signal. Jitter,
shimmer, and NHR correlate with perceptual evaluations of voice quality, such as harsh,
whispery, creaky, and nasalized, inter alia. Pitch slope features capture elements of
the intonational contour, and were computed by fitting least-squares linear regression
models to the F0 data points extracted from given portions of the signal, such as a
full word or its last 200 msec. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows
the pitch track of a sample utterance (blue dots) with three linear regressions, com-
puted over the whole utterance (solid black line), and over the final 300 and 200 msec

All features related to absolute (i.e., unnormalized) pitch values, such as maximum
pitch or final pitch slope, are not comparable across genders because of the different
pitch ranges of female and male speakers—roughly 75–500 kHz and 50–300 kHz, respec-
tively. Therefore, before computing those features we applied a linear transformation
to the pitch track values, thus making the pitch range of speakers of both genders
approximately equivalent. We refer to this process as gender normalization. All other
normalizations were calculated using z-scores: z = (x − R)/u, where x is a raw mea-
surement to be normalized (e.g., the duration of a particular word), and R and u are
the mean and standard deviation of a certain population (e.g., all instances of the same
word by the same speaker in the whole conversation).
For our phonetic features (listed in Table 8), we trained an automatic phone rec-
ognizer based on the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) (Young et al. 2006), using
three corpora as training data: the TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus
(Garofolo et al. 1993), the Boston Directions Corpus (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996),
and the Columbia Games Corpus. With this recognizer, we obtained automatic time-
aligned phonetic transcriptions of each instance of alright, mm-hm, okay, right, uh-huh,
and yeah in the corpus. To improve accuracy, we restricted the recognizer’s grammar to
accept only the most frequent variations of each word, as shown in Table 9. We extracted
our phonetic features, such as phone and syllable durations, from the resulting time-
aligned phonetic transcriptions. The remaining five ACWs in our corpus (gotcha, huh,
yep, yes, and yup) had too low counts to contain meaningful phonetic variation; thus, we
did not compute phonetic features for those words.
Finally, our session-specific features include the session of the Games Corpus in
which the target word was produced, along with the identity and gender of both

speakers (Table 8). These features were solely intended for searching for speaker or
dialogue dependencies.
Also, to simulate the conditions of on-line applications, which process speech as
it is produced by the user, we distinguish a subset of features that may typically be
extracted from the speech signal only up to the IPU containing the target ACW. In
Tables 4 through 8 these features are marked with letter 0 (for on-line). All on-line fea-
tures can be computed automatically in real time by state-of-the-art speech processing
applications, although it should be noted that all of our lexical and discourse features
strongly rely on a speech recognizer output, which typically has a high error rate for
spontaneous productions. All on-line features are also available in off-line conditions;
the remaining features (those not tagged 0 in Tables 4 through 8) are normally available
only in offline conditions. We distinguish online features for the machine learning exper-
iments described in Section 5, in which we assess, among other things, the usefulness
of information contained in different feature sets, simulating the conditions of actual
on-line and off-line applications.
In the following sections, we use the features described here in several ways. We
first perform a series of statistical tests to find differences across the various func-
tions of ACWs. Subsequently, we experiment with machine learning techniques for the
automatic classification of the function of ACWs, training the models with different
combinations of features.

In this section we present results of a series of statistical tests aimed at identifying con-
textual, acoustic, and prosodic differences in the production of the various discourse/
pragmatic functions of affirmative cue words. This kind of characterization is important
both for interpretation and for production in spoken language applications: If we can
find reliable features that effectively distinguish the various uses of these words, we can
hope to interpret them automatically and generate them appropriately.

4.1 Position in IPU and Turn
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991277777778">
We begin this analysis by looking at the discourse position of the various discourse/
pragmatic functions of ACWs. Because these words help shape, or at least reflect,
the structure of conversations, we expect to find positional differences between their
functions. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the six most frequent ACWs in the corpus
(alright, okay, yeah, mm-hm, uh-huh, and right) with respect to their position in their IPU.
An IPU-initial word is one that occurs in the first position in its corresponding IPU; that
is, it is preceded by at least 50 msec of silence and followed by another word. An IPU-
final word occurs last in its IPU. An IPU-medial word is both immediately preceded
and followed by other words. Lastly, a single-word IPU is an individual word both
preceded and followed by silence. Figure 3 also depicts the distribution of discourse/
pragmatic functions within each of these four categories. For example, roughly 40% of
all tokens of alright in the corpus occur as IPU initial; of those, about half are agreements
(Agr), half are cues to beginning discourse segments (CBeg), and a marginal number
convey other functions.
Similarly, Figure 4 shows the distribution of the same six ACWs with respect to their
position in the corresponding conversational turn. Turn-initial, turn-medial, and turn-
final words, and single-word turns are defined analogously to the four IPU-related
categories defined previously, but considering conversational turns instead of IPUs.

<bodyText confidence="0.999981">
From these figures we observe several interesting aspects of the discourse position
of ACWs in the Games Corpus. Only a minority of these words occur as IPU medial
or IPU final. The only exception appears to be right, for which a high proportion of
instances do occur in such positions—mainly tokens with the literal modifier (Mod)
meaning, but also tokens used to check with the interlocutor (Chk), which take place at
the end of a turn (and thus, of an IPU).
The default function of ACWs, agreement (Agr), occurs for alright, okay, yeah, and
right in all possible positions within the IPU and the turn; for mm-hm and uh-huh,
agreements occur mostly as full conversational turns. Nearly all backchannels (BC)
occur as separate turns, with only a handful of exceptions: In four cases, the backchannel
is followed by a pause in which the interlocutor chooses not to continue speaking, and
the utterer of the backchannel takes the turn; in two other cases, two backchannels are
uttered in fast repetition (e.g., uh-huh uh-huh).
From the six lexical items analyzed in Tables 3 and 4, two pairs of words seem to
pattern similarly. The first such pair consists of mm-hm and uh-huh, which show very
similar distributions and are realized almost always as single-word turns, as either Agr
or BC. The second pair of words with comparable patterns of IPU and turn position
are alright and okay. These are precisely the only two ACWs used to convey all ten
discourse/pragmatic functions in the Games Corpus (recall from Table 2). This result
suggests that the lexical items in these two pairs may be used interchangeably in
conversation. The word yeah presents a pattern analogous to that of alright and okay,
albeit with fewer meanings.
In all, these findings confirm the existence of large differences in the discourse
position of ACWs between their functional types, as well as between their lexical
types. We will revisit this topic in Section 5, where we discuss the predictive power

such a task.

4.2 Word-Final Intonation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.82778495">
Shifting our attention to acoustic/prosodic characteristics of ACWs, we examine next
the manner in which word-final intonation varies across ACW functions. First we look
at two categorical variables in the ToBI framework which capture the final pitch incur-
sion: phrase accent and boundary tone. Figure 5 shows the distribution of ToBI labels for
each of the six most frequent ACWs and their corresponding functions (see Section 3.3
for a description of the ToBI labeling conventions). The distributions for alright, okay,
right, and yeah depart significantly from random (alright: Fisher’s Exact test, p = 0.0483;
okay: Pearson’s Chi-squared test, x2(24) = 261, p ≈ 0; right: Pearson, x2(8) = 220, p ≈ 0;
yeah: Fisher, p ≈ 0).5,6 For right, considering just its discourse/pragmatic functions (i.e.,
excluding its Mod instances), the distribution also significantly differs from random
(Fisher, p ≈ 0). On the other hand, the distributions for mm-hm and uh-huh do not depart
significantly from random.
5 Fisher’s Exact test was used whenever the accuracy of Pearson’s Chi-squared test was compromised by
data sparsity.
6 We performed statistical tests for approximately 35 variables on the same data set. Applying the
Bonferroni correction, the alpha value should be lowered from the standard 0.05 to 0.05/35 ≈ 0.0014 to
maintain the familywise error rate. Thus, a result would be significant when p &lt; 0.0014. According to
this, most tests are still significant in the current section; however, the Tukey post hoc tests following our
ANOVA tests are not: most of these have a confidence level of 95%, and significant differences begin to
disappear when considering a confidence level of 99%.

<bodyText confidence="0.992482770833333">
The first clear pattern we find is that the backchannel function (BC) shows a marked
preference for a high-rising (H-H% in the ToBI conventions) or low-rising (L-H%) pitch
contour towards the end of the word. Those two contours account for more than 60%
of the backchannel instances of mm-hm, okay, uh-huh, and yeah. For the other ACWs
there are not enough instances labeled BC in the corpus for statistical comparison.
The predominance of H% found for backchannels is consistent with the openness that
such boundary tone has been hypothesized to indicate (Hobbs 1990; Pierrehumbert
and Hirschberg 1990). The utterer of a backchannel understands that (i) there is
more to be said, and (ii) it is the speaker holding the conversational turn who must
say it.
The default function of ACWs, agreement (Agr) is produced most often with falling
(L-L%) or plateau final intonation ([!]H-L%) in the case of alright, okay, right, and yeah.
The L% boundary tone is believed to indicate the opposite of H%, a sense of closure,
separating the current phrase from a subsequent one (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg
1990). In our case, by agreeing with what the speaker has said, the listener indicates that
enough information has been provided and that any subsequent phrases may refer to a
different topic. In other words, such closure might mean that the proposition preceding
the ACW has been added to the current context space (Reichman 1985), or that a new
focus space is about to be created (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
Notably, Agr instances of mm-hm and uh-huh present a very different behavior from
the other lexical items, with a distribution of final intonations that closely resembles
that of backchannels. In particular, over 60% of the Agr tokens of mm-hm and uh-huh
are produced with final rising intonation (either L-H% or H-H%). As we will see in the
following sections, the realization of mm-hm and uh-huh as Agr or BC seems to be very
similar along several dimensions besides intonation.
Alright and okay are the only two ACWs in the corpus that are used to cue the
beginning of a new discourse segment, either combined with an agreement function
(PBeg) or in its pure form (CBeg). These two functions typically have a falling (L-L%) or
sustained ([!]H-L%) final pitch contour. Additionally, the instances of okay and yeah used
to cue a discourse segment ending (PEnd) tend to be produced with a L-L% contour, and
also with [!]H-L% in the case of okay. This predominance of L% for ACWs conveying a
discourse boundary function is consistent with the previously mentioned closure that
such boundary tone is believed to indicate.
Lastly, the only ACW used frequently in the corpus for checking with the interlocu-
tor (the Chk function) is right, as illustrated in the following exchange:
A: and the top’s not either, right?
B: no
A: okay
Such instances of right in the corpus normally end in a high-rising pitch contour,
or H-H%. This fact is probably explained by the close semantic resemblance of
this construction to yes–no questions, which typically end in the same contour type
(Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990).
In addition to the categorical prosodic variables described previously, word final
intonation may also be studied by measuring the slope of the word-final pitch track
(see Section 3.3 for a description of how pitch slopes are calculated). A high positive
value of pitch slope corresponds to a rising intonation; a value close to zero, to a flat
intonation; a high negative value, to a falling intonation. Final pitch slope has the ad-
vantage of being automatically computable; ToBI labels, on the other hand, still must be

manually annotated—although ongoing research may change this fact in the near future
(Rosenberg and Hirschberg 2009; Rosenberg 2010a, 2010b). Therefore, it is important to
verify that the results obtained using ToBI labels—if they are to be of practical use—
are also observable when considering numeric measures such as pitch slope. Figure 6
shows, for the same ACWs and functions discussed earlier,7 the mean pitch slope
computed over the second half of the word and over its final 100 and 200 msec, and
gender-normalized as described in Section 3.
The comparison of these numeric acoustic features across discourse/pragmatic
functions confirms that the observations made previously for categorical prosodic fea-
tures also hold when considering numeric features such as pitch slope, thus making the
likelihood that such observations will be of practical use in actual systems. For okay,
the three measures of word-final pitch slope are significantly higher for backchannels
(BC) than for all other functions, and significantly lower for CBeg than for Agr, BC,
and PEnd (RMANOVA for each of the three variables: between-subjects p &gt; 0.3, within
subjects p ≈ 0; Tukey test confidence: 95%).8 BC tokens of yeah are also significantly
higher than Agr, with similar p-values. Figure 6 shows that BC instances of mm-hm

8 Repeated-measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) tests estimate the existence of both within-subjects
effects (i.e., differences between discourse/pragmatic functions) and between-subjects effects (i.e.,
differences between speakers). When the between-subjects effects are negligible, we may safely draw
conclusions across multiple speakers in the corpus, with low risk of a bias from the behavior of a
particular subset of speakers.

and uh-huh also have comparably high final pitch slopes. Again, for mm-hm we find no
significant difference in final pitch slope between agreements and backchannels.
Although Figure 6 shows that Chk tokens of right tend to end in a steeply rising
pitch, the RMANOVA tests yield between-subjects p-values of 0.01 or lower, indicating
substantial speaker effects. In other words, even though the general tendency for these
tokens, as indicated by both the numeric and categorical variables, seems to be to end
in a high-rising intonation, there is evidence of different behavior for some individual
speakers, which keeps us from drawing general conclusions about this pragmatic func-
tion of right.

4.3 Intensity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999652166666667">
The next feature we find to vary significantly with the discourse/pragmatic function
of ACWs is word intensity. Commonly referred to as loudness or volume, intensity
generally functions to make words more salient or prominent. Figure 7 shows the
maximum and mean intensity for the most frequent ACWs and functions, computed
over the whole word and speaker normalized using z-scores.
The two types of differences we find are related to the discourse functions of
ACWs. For okay and yeah, both maximum and mean intensity are significantly lower
for instances cueing the end of a discourse segment (PEnd) than instances of all other
functions (for both variables and both words, RMANOVA tests report between-subjects
p &gt; 0.4 and within-subjects p ≈ 0; Tukey 95%). For ACWs cueing a beginning discourse
segment, the opposite is true. Instances of alright and okay labeled CBeg or PBeg have
a maximum and mean intensity significantly higher than all other functions (for alright,

a RMANOVA test reports between-subjects p &gt; 0.12 and within-subjects p ≈ 0). These
results are consistent with previous studies of prosodic variation relative to discourse
structure, which find intensity to increase at the start of a new topic and decrease at the
end (Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy 1980; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). Because by
definition CBeg/PBeg ACWs begin a new topic and CEnd/PEnd end one, it is then not
surprising to find that the former tend to be produced with higher intensity, and the
latter with lower.
Finally, for mm-hm and uh-huh we find no significant differences in intensity be-
tween their unique functions, agreement (Agr) and backchannel (BC). Recall from the
previous section that we find no differences in final intonation either. This further
suggests that these two lexical types tend to be produced with similar acoustic/prosodic
features, independently of their function.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980207">
4.4 Other Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861617647059">
For the remaining acoustic/prosodic features analyzed, we find a small number of sig-
nificant or approaching-significance differences between the functions of ACWs. These
differences are related to duration, mean pitch, and voice quality. The first set of findings
corresponds to the duration of ACWs, normalized with respect to all words with the
same number of syllables and phonemes uttered by the same speaker. For alright and
okay, instances cueing a beginning (CBeg) tend to be shorter than the other functions
(for both words, RMANOVA: between-subjects p &gt; 0.5, within-subjects p &lt; 0.05, Tukey
95%). We also find tokens of right used to check with the interlocutor (Chk) to be
on average shorter than the other two functions of right (RMANOVA, between-subjects
p &gt; 0.7, within-subjects p = 0.001; Tukey 95%). Note that these two functions are rel-
atively simple: CBeg calls for the listener’s attention, and is frequently conveyed with
a filled pause (uh, um); Chk asks the interlocutor for confirmation, which may alter-
natively be achieved via a high-rising intonation. Thus, it is not surprising that these
functions take less time to be realized than other more pragmatically loaded functions,
such as agreement.
Speaker-normalized mean pitch over the whole word also presents significant
differences for okay and yeah. Instances labeled PEnd (agreement and cue ending
discourse segment) present a higher mean pitch than the other functions (for both
words, RMANOVA: between-subjects p &gt; 0.6, within-subjects p &lt; 0.01; Tukey 95%). This
is rather unexpected, because as noted in Section 4.2 around 70% of PEnd ACWs in the
corpus end in a L% boundary tone, and thus they would plausibly be uttered with a
low pitch level. What our data indicate, however, is that speakers tend to reset and raise
their pitch range when producing PEnd instances of ACWs.
Finally, we find some evidence of differences in voice quality. Both alright and
okay show a lower shimmer over voiced portions when starting a new segment (CBeg)
(RMANOVA: between-subjects p &gt; 0.9 for alright, p = 0.09 for okay; within-subjects
p &lt; 0.001 for both words). Also, okay and yeah present a lower noise-to-harmonics ratio
(NHR) for backchannels (RMANOVA: between-subjects p &gt; 0.3 for okay, p = 0.04 for
yeah; within-subjects p &lt; 0.005 for both words). A lower value of shimmer and NHR
has been associated with the perception of a better voice quality (Eskenazi, Childers,
and Hicks 1990; Bhuta, Patrick, and Garnett 2004). Our results suggest, then, that voice
quality may constitute another dimension along which speakers vary their productions
to convey the intended discourse/pragmatic meaning. Notice though that for these two
variables some of the between-subjects p-values are low enough to suggest significant

5. Automatic Classification of Affirmative Cue Words
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948911111112">
In this section we present results from machine learning (ML) experiments aimed at
investigating how accurately affirmative cue words may be classified automatically
into their various discourse/pragmatic functions. If spoken dialogue systems are to
interpret and generate ACWs reliably, we must identify reliable cues. With this goal
in mind, we explore several dimensions of the problem: We consider three classification
tasks, simulating the conditions of different speech applications, and study the perfor-
mance of different ML algorithms and feature sets on each task. We note that previous
studies have attempted to disambiguate between the sentential and discourse uses of
cue phrases such as now, well, and like, in corpora containing comparable numbers of
instances of each class. For ACWs in the Games Corpus dialogues, sentential uses are
rare, with the sole exception of right. Therefore, disambiguating between discourse and
sentential uses appears to be less useful than distinguishing among different discourse
functions.
The first ML task we consider consists in the general classification of any ACW
(alright, gotcha, huh, mm-hm, okay, right, uh-huh, yeah, yep, yes, yup) into any function
(Agr, BC, CBeg, PBeg, CEnd, PEnd, Mod, BTsk, Chk, Stl; see Table 1), a critical task
for spoken dialogue systems seeking to interpret user input in general. The second task
involves identifying instances of these words used to signal the beginning (CBeg, PBeg
in our labeling scheme) or ending (CEnd, PEnd) of a discourse segment, which is im-
portant for applications that must segment speech into coherent units, such as meeting
browsing systems and turn-taking components of spoken dialogue systems. The third
task consists in identifying tokens conveying some degree of acknowledgment: (Agr,
BC, PBeg, and PEnd), a function especially important to spoken dialogue systems, for
which it is critical to know that a user has heard the system’s output.
Speech processing applications operate in disparate conditions. On-line applica-
tions such as spoken dialogue systems process information as it is generated, having
access to a limited amount of context, normally up to the last IPU uttered by the user.
On the other hand, off-line applications, such as meeting transcription and browsing
systems, have the whole audio file available for processing. We simulate these two
conditions in our experiments, assessing how the limitations of online systems af-
fect performance. We also group the features described in Section 3.3 into five sets—
lexical (LX), discourse (DS), timing (TM), acoustic (AC), and phonetic (PH); see Tables 4
through 8—to determine the relative importance of each feature set in the various
classification tasks. For example, this approach allows us to simulate the conditions
of the understanding component of a spoken dialogue system, which can use only the
information up through the current IPU to detect the function of a user’s ACW. Such
a system may have access only to ASR transcription or it may have access to acoustic
and prosodic information; we note that our analysis does not take into account the pos-
sibility that transcriptions are likely to contain some errors. Our approach also allows
us to simulate a text-to-speech (TTS) system which might be used to produce a spoken
version of an on-line chat room. In order to choose the appropriate acoustic/prosodic
realization of each ACW, the TTS system will first need to determine its function based
on features extracted solely from the input text (in our taxonomy, LX and DS).
We conduct our ML experiments using three well-known algorithms with very
different characteristics: the decision tree learner C4.5 (Quinlan 1993), the propositional

9 In the case of SVM, prior to the actual tests we experimented with two kernel types: polynomial
(K(x, y) = (x + y)d) and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) (K(x,y) = exp(−y||x − y||2) for y &gt; 0). We
performed a grid search for the optimal arguments for either kernel using the data portion left out after

on word identity. In the general classification task, the majority class is Agr, and the
best performing word-based rule is huh-+Chk, mm-hm-+Mod, uh-huh-+BC, right-+
Mod, others-+Agr. For the identification of a discourse boundary function, the
majority class is no-boundary, and the word-based rule also assigns no-boundary to
all tokens. For the detection of an acknowledgment function, the majority class
is acknowledgment, and the word-based rule is right, huh-+no-acknowledgment;
others-+acknowledgment.
The error rates of human labelers are estimated using two different approaches.
Our first estimate compares the labels assigned by each labeler and the majority labels
as defined in Section 3.1. Because each labeler’s labels are used for calculating both the
error rate and the gold standard, this estimate is likely to be over-optimistic. Our second
estimate considers the subset of cases in which two annotators agree, and compares
those labels with the third labeler’s. Tables 10 and 11 show that these two estimates
yield similar results; for PEnd and Chk, there are not enough counts for computing the
F-measure of estimate 2.
The right half of Table 10 shows the F-measure of the SVM classifier for each
individual ACW function, for the general task. The highest F-measures correspond to
Agr, BC, CBeg, and Mod, precisely the four functions with the highest counts in the
Games Corpus. For PBeg and Chk the F-measures are much lower (and equal to zero
for the four remaining functions, not included in the table) due very likely to their low
counts, which prevent a better generalization during the learning stage. Future research
could investigate incorporating boosting and bootstrapping techniques to reduce the
negative effect on classification of low counts for some of the discourse/pragmatic
functions of ACWs.
For the three classification tasks, SVM outperforms, or performs at least comparably
to, the other two classifiers whenever acoustic features (AC) are taken into account
together with other feature types. When used alone, though, acoustic features per-
form poorly in all three tasks. Moreover, when acoustic features are excluded, SVM’s
accuracy is comparable to, or worse than, C4.5 and Ripper. This is probably due to
the fact that SVM’s mathematical model is better suited to exploit larger amounts of
continuous numerical variables, and thus makes a difference when including acoustic
features.
For the first two tasks, the SVM classifier seems to take advantage of all but one
feature type, as shown by the significantly lower performance resulting from removing
any of the feature types from the full model—the sole exception is the phonetic type
(PH), whose removal in no case negatively affects the accuracy of any classifier. C4.5
and Ripper, on the other hand, appear to take more advantage of some feature types
than others. For the third task, lexical (LX) and discourse (DS) features apparently have
more predictive power for both C4.5 and SVM than the other types. Note also that
for the second and third tasks, the error rates of our full-model SVM classifiers closely
approximate the estimated error rates of human labelers.
For the general task of classifying any ACW into any discourse/pragmatic function,
our full-model SVM classifier achieves the best overall results. To take a closer look at
the performance of this model, we compute its F-measure for the discourse/pragmatic
functions of each individual lexical item, as shown in Table 12. We observe that the
classifier achieves better results for word–function pairs with higher counts in the
Games Corpus, such as yeah-Agr or right-Mod (cf. Table 2). Again, the low counts
for the remaining word–function pairs may prevent a better generalization during the
learning stage, a problem that could be attenuated in future work with boosting and
bootstrapping techniques.

5.2 Session-Specific and ToBI Prosodic Features

When including session-specific features in the full model, such as identity and gender
of both speakers (see Table 8), the error rate of the SVM classifier is significantly reduced
for the general task (13.3%) and for the discourse boundary function identification task
(6.4%) (Wilcoxon, p &lt; 0.05). For the detection of an acknowledgment function, the error
rate is not modified when including those features (4.5%). This suggests the existence
of speaker differences in the production of at least some functions of ACWs that may be
exploited by ML classifiers. Finally, the inclusion of categorical prosodic features based
on the ToBI framework, such as type of pitch accent and break index on the target word
(see Table 5), does not improve the performance of the SVM-based full models in any of
the classification tasks.

5.3 Individual Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998823529412">
To estimate the importance of individual features in our classification tasks, we rank
them according to an information-gain metric. We find that for the three tasks, lexical
(LX), discourse (DS), and timing (TM) features dominate. The highest ranked features are
the ones capturing the position of the target word in its IPU and in its turn. Lexical
identity and POS tags of the previous, target, and following words, and duration of
the target word, are also ranked high. Acoustic features appear lower in the ranking;
the best performing ones are word intensity (range, mean, and standard deviation),
pitch (maximum and mean), pitch slope over the final part of the word (200 msec and
second half), voiced-frames ratio, and noise-to-harmonics ratio. All phonetic features
are ranked very low. Note that, whereas durational features at the word level are
ranked high, durational features at the phonetic level are not, because the latter only
capture the duration of each phone relative to the word duration—apparently not an
informative attribute for these classification tasks. These results confirm the existence of
large positional differences across functions of ACWs, as seen in Section 4. Additionally,
whereas several acoustic/prosodic features extracted from the target word contain use-
ful information for the automatic disambiguation of ACWs, it is positional information
that provides the most predictive power.

in Tables 4 through 8 with letter O. With these features, we train and evaluate an SVM
classifier for the three tasks described previously. Table 13 shows the results, comparing
the performance of each classifier to that of the models trained on the full feature set,
which simulate the conditions of off-line applications. In all three cases the on-line
model performs significantly worse than its offline correlate, but also significantly better
than the baseline (Wilcoxon, p &lt; 0.05).
Table 13 also shows the error rates of on-line and off-line classifiers trained using
solely text-based features—that is, only features of lexical (LX) or discourse (DS) types.
Text-based models simulate the conditions of spoken dialogue systems with no access
to acoustic and prosodic information, or generation systems attempting to realize text-
based exchanges in speech. They reflect the importance of text information alone in
training such systems to recognize the function of ACWs on-line and off-line and to
produce appropriate realizations from limited or full transcription.
Our on-line and off-line text-based models perform significantly worse than the
corresponding models that use the whole feature set, but they still outperform the
baseline models in all cases (Wilcoxon, p &lt; 0.05). Finally, the off-line text-based models
also outperform their on-line correlates in all three tasks (Wilcoxon, p &lt; 0.05). These
results indicate the important role that other classes of cues play in recognition, while
indicating the level of performance we can expect from TTS systems which have only
text available.

5.5 Backchannel Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999757357142857">
The correct identification of backchannels is a desirable capability for speech processing
systems, as it would allow us to distinguish between two quite distinct speaker inten-
tions: the intention to take the conversational floor, and the intention to backchannel.
We first consider an off-line binary classification task—namely, classifying all
ACWs in the corpus into backchannels vs. the rest, using information from the whole
conversation. In such a task, an SVM classifier achieves a 4.91% error rate, slightly
yet significantly outperforming a word-based baseline (mm-hm, uh-huh→BC; others→
no-BC), with 5.17% (Wilcoxon, p &lt; 0.05).
On-line applications such as spoken dialogue systems need to classify every new
speaker contribution immediately after (or even while) it is uttered, and certainly
without access to any subsequent context. The Games Corpus contains approximately
6,700 turns following speech from the other speaker, all of which begin as potential
backchannels and need to be disambiguated by the listener. Most of these candidates
can be trivially discarded using a simple observation about backchannels: By definition

they are short, isolated utterances, and consist normally in just one ACW. Of the 6,700
candidate turns in the corpus, only 2,351 (35%) begin with an isolated ACW, including
753 of the 757 backchannels in the corpus.12 Thus, an on-line classification procedure
would only need to identify backchannels in those 2,351 turns. At this point, we ex-
plore using a binary classifier for this task. The same word-based majority baseline
described earlier achieves an error rate of 11.56%. An SVM classifier trained on features
extracted from up to the current IPU (to simulate the on-line condition of a spoken
dialogue system) fails to improve over this baseline, achieving an error rate of 11.51%,
not significantly different from the baseline. A possible explanation for this might be
that backchannels seem to be difficult to distinguish from agreements in many cases,
leading to an increase in the error rate. Recall, from the statistical analyses in the
previous section, the positional and acoustic/prosodic similarities of tokens with these
two functions for mm-hm and uh-huh, for example. Shriberg et al. (1998) report the same
difficulty in distinguishing these two word functions. We conclude that further research
is needed to develop novel approaches to this crucial problem of spoken dialogue
systems.

5.6 Comparison with Previous Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992961538462">
In an effort to provide a general frame of reference for our results, we discuss here
what we believe to be the most relevant results from related studies. Note, however,
that comparing these results directly to the results of our classification experiments
is difficult because the type of corpora, definitions used, features examined, and/or
methodology employed vary greatly among the studies. The current study focuses
exclusively on the discourse/pragmatic functions of ACWs whereas other studies have
either a broader or narrower scope.
Among the cue words tested in Litman (1996) is okay, one of the ACWs we also
investigate. Litman describes the automatic classification of cue words in general (in-
cluding, e.g., now, well, say, and so), classifying these into discourse and sentential uses
using a corpus of monologue. In this classification task, which is not performed in our
study, the best results are reached by decision-tree learners trained on prosodic and
text-based features, with an error rate of 13.8%.
The most relevant study to ours is that of Stolcke et al. (2000), which presents
experiments on the automatic disambiguation of dialogue acts (DA) on 1,155 sponta-
neous telephone conversations from the Switchboard corpus, labeled using the DAMSL
(Dialogue Act Markup in Several Layers) annotation scheme (Core and Allen 1997). For
the subtask of identifying the Agreement and Backchannels tags collapsed together, the
authors report an error rate of 27.1% when using prosodic features, 19.0% when using
features extracted from the text, and 15.3% when using all features. Other DA classi-
fications also include some of the functions of ACWs discussed in our current study.
For instance, Reithinger and Klesen (1997) employ a Bayesian approach for classifying
18 classes of DAs in transcripts of 437 German dialogues from the VERBMOBIL corpus
(Jekat et al. 1995). The DA tags examined include Accept, Confirm, and Feedback, all
of which are related to the functions of ACWs discussed here. For the Accept DA tag,
the authors report an F-measure of 0.69; for Feedback, 0.48; and for Confirm, 0.40. These

12 The four remaining backchannels correspond to a rare phenomenon in which the speaker overlaps the
interlocutor’s last phrase with a short agreement, followed by an optional short pause and a backchannel.
Example: A: but it doesn’t overlap *them. B: right* yeah yeah # okay.

experiments are repeated on transcripts of 163 English dialogues from the same corpus,
yielding an F-measure of 0.78 for the Accept DA tag, and 0 for the other two tags due to
data sparsity.
As part of a study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of machine learning for this
type of task, Core (1998) experiments with hand-coded decision trees for classifying
five high-level dialogue act classes, including AGREEMENT and UNDERSTANDING,
following the DAMSL annotation scheme. On 19 dialogues from the TRAINs corpus
(discussions related to solving transportation problems), Core reports an accuracy of
70% for both the Agreement and the Understanding DA classes, using only the previous
utterance’s DAMSL tag as a feature in the decision trees. This use of DA context in
classifying ACWs would appear to be promising, assuming an accurate automatic
classification of all DAs in the corpus.
Finally, Lampert, Dale, and Paris (2006) describe a statistical classifier trained on
text-based features for automatically predicting eight different speech acts derived from
a taxonomy called Verbal Response Modes (VRM). The experiments are conducted
on transcripts of 1,368 utterances from 14 dialogues in English. For the Acknowledg-
ment speech act (which “conveys receipt of or receptiveness to other’s communication;
simple acceptance, salutations; e.g., yes” [page 37]), the classifier yields an F-measure
of 0.75.
Again, all of these studies differ significantly from our own, in their task definition,
in their methodology, and in the domain they examine. However, we expect this brief
summary to serve as a general frame of reference for our own classification results.

6. Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995541666667">
In this work we have undertaken a comprehensive study of affirmative cue words, a
subset of cue phrases such as okay, yeah, or alright that may be utilized to convey as
many as ten different discourse/pragmatic functions, such as indicating continued
attention to the interlocutor or cueing the beginning of a new topic. Considering
the high frequency of ACWs in task-oriented dialogue, it is critical for some spoken
language processing applications such as spoken dialogue systems to model the usage
of these words correctly, from both an understanding and a generation perspective.
Section 4 presents statistical evidence of a number of differences in the production
of the various discourse/pragmatic functions of ACWs. The most notable contrasts in
acoustic/prosodic features relate to word final intonation and word intensity. Backchan-
nels typically end in a rising intonation; agreements and cue beginnings, in a falling
intonation. Cue beginnings tend to be produced with a high intensity, and cue endings
with a very low one. Other acoustic/prosodic features—duration, mean pitch, and
voice quality—also seem to vary with the word usage. Our findings related to final
intonation are consistent with previous results obtained by Hockey (1993) and Jurafsky
et al. (1998) for American English. For Scottish English, Kowtko (1996) reports a non-
rising intonation for cue beginnings and for her ‘reply-y’ function, a subclass of our
agreement function. Kowtko also reports observing all types of final intonation in her
‘acknowledge’ function, whose definition overlaps both our agreements and backchan-
nels. Thus, we find no apparent contradictions between Kowtko’s results for Scottish
English and ours for American English.
The word okay is the most heavily overloaded ACW in our corpus. Our corpus
includes instances conveying each of the ten identified meanings, and this item shows
the highest degree of variation along the acoustic/prosodic features we have examined.

<bodyText confidence="0.99984578">
We speculate from this finding that the more ambiguous an ACW, the more a speaker
needs to vary acoustic/prosodic features to differentiate its meaning.
Our statistical analysis of ACWs also shows that these words display substantial
positional differences across functions, such as the position of the word in its con-
versational turn, or whether the word is preceded and/or followed by silence. Such
large differences bring support to Novick and Sutton’s (1994) claim that the discourse/
pragmatic role of these expressions strongly depends on their basic structural context.
For example, in Novick and Sutton’s words, an ACW in turn-initial position is “clearly
not serving as a prompt for the other speaker to continue” (page 97).
Previous studies on the automatic disambiguation of other types of cue words, such
as now, well, or like, present the problem as a binary classification task: Each cue word has
either a discourse or a sentential sense (e.g., Litman 1996; Zufferey and Popescu-Belis
2004). In the study of automatic classification of ACWs presented in Section 5 we show
that for spoken task-oriented dialogue, the simple discourse/sentential distinction is
insufficient. In consequence, we define two new classification tasks besides the general
task of classifying any ACW into any function. Our first task, the detection of an
acknowledgment function, has important implications for the language management
component in spoken dialogue systems, which must keep track of which material has
reached mutual belief in a conversation (Bunt, Morante, and Keizer 2007; Roque and
Traum 2009). Our second task, the detection of a discourse segment boundary func-
tion, should help in discourse segmentation and meeting processing tasks (Litman and
Passonneau 1995). Our SVM models based on lexical, discourse, timing, and acoustic
features approach the error rate of trained human labelers in all tasks, while our auto-
matically computed phonetic features offer no improvement. Previous studies indicate
that the pragmatic function of ambiguous expressions may be effectively predicted by
models that combine information extracted from various sources, including lexical and
prosodic (e.g., Litman 1996; Stolcke et al. 2000). Our results support this, and extend the
list of useful information sources to include discourse and timing features that may be
easily extracted from the time-aligned transcripts.
Additionally, our machine learning study includes experiments with several combi-
nations of feature sets, in an attempt to simulate the conditions of different applications.
Models that are trained using features extracted only from the speech signal up to the
IPU containing the target word simulate on-line applications such as spoken dialogue
systems with access to acoustic/prosodic features. Although such models perform
worse than “off-line” models, which make use of left and right context, they still sig-
nificantly outperform our baseline classifiers. Models that simulate the conditions of
current spoken dialogue systems with access only to lexical features (although perhaps
errorful) and TTS systems synthesizing spoken conversations, which have access only
to features extracted from the input text, also significantly outperform our baseline
classifiers.
Interactions between state-of-the-art spoken dialogue systems and their users ap-
pear to contain very few instances of backchannel responses from either conversational
partner. On the system’s side, the absence of this important element of spoken com-
munication may be due to the difficulty of detecting appropriate moments where a
backchannel response would be welcome by the user. Recent advances on that research
topic (Ward and Tsukahara 2000; Cathcart, Carletta, and Klein 2003; Gravano and
Hirschberg 2009a) have encouraged research on ways to equip systems with the ability
to signal to the user that the system is still listening (Maatman, Gratch, and Marsella
2005; Bevacqua, Mancini, and Pelachaud 2008; Morency, de Kok, and Gratch 2008)—
for example, when the user is asked to enter large amounts of information. On the

user’s side, an important reason for not backchanneling may lie in the unnaturalness
of such systems, often described as “confusing” or even “intimidating” by users, as
well as their inability to recognize backchannels as such. Nonetheless, recent Wizard-
of-Oz experiments conducted by Hjalmarsson (2009, 2011) show that humans appear
to react to turn-management cues produced by a synthetic voice in the same way that
they react to cues produced by another human. This important finding suggests that
users of spoken dialogue systems could be cued to produce backchannel responses, for
example to determine if they are still paying attention. In that case, it will be crucial for
systems to be able to distinguish backchannels from other pragmatic functions (Shriberg
et al. 1998). In Section 5.5 we present results on the task of automatically identifying
backchannel ACWs from the other possible functions. Our models improve over the
baseline in an off-line condition (e.g., for meeting processing tasks), but fail to do so
in an on-line setting (e.g., for spoken dialogue systems). Practically all of the confusion
of this on-line model comes from misclassifying agreements (Agr) as backchannels (BC)
and vice versa. The reliability of our human labelers for distinguishing these two classes
was measured by Fleiss’s κ at 0.570, a level considerably lower than the 0.745 achieved
for the general labeling task, which indicates that the backchannel identification task is
difficult for humans as well, at least when they are not engaged in the conversation itself
but only listening to it after the fact. Although we asked our annotators to distinguish
the agreement function of ACWs from “continued attention,” there are clearly cases
where people disagree about whether speakers are indicating agreement or not. In
future research we will investigate this issue in more detail, given the relevance of
on-line identification of backchannels in spoken dialogue systems.
In summary, in this study we have identified a number of characterizations of
affirmative cue words in a large corpus of SAE task-oriented dialogue. The corpus
on which our experiments were conducted, rich in ACWs conveying a wide range
of discourse/pragmatic functions, has allowed us to systematically investigate many
dimensions of these words, including their production and automatic disambiguation.
Besides the value of our findings from a linguistic modeling perspective, we believe
that incorporating these results into the production and understanding components of
spoken dialogue systems should improve their performance and increase user satisfac-
tion levels accordingly, getting us one step closer to the long-term goal of effectively
emulating human behavior in dialogue systems.

The COLUMBIA GAMES CORPUS is a collection of 12 spontaneous task-oriented dyadic
conversations elicited from native speakers of Standard American English. The cor-
pus was collected and annotated jointly by the Spoken Language Group at Columbia
University and the Department of Linguistics at Northwestern University. In each of
the 12 sessions, two subjects were paid to play a series of computer games requiring
verbal communication to achieve joint goals of identifying and moving images on the
screen. Each subject used a separate laptop computer and could not see the screen of the
other subject. They sat facing each other in a soundproof booth, with an opaque curtain
hanging between them, so that all communication was verbal. The subjects’ speech was
not restricted in any way, and it was emphasized at the session beginning that the game
was not timed. Subjects were told that their goal was to accumulate as many points as
possible over the entire session, since they would be paid additional money for each
point they earned.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932058823529">
Subjects were first asked to play three instances of the CARDS game, where they were
shown cards with one to four images on them. Images were of two sizes (small or large)
and various colors, and were selected to contain primarily voiced consonants, which
facilitates pitch track computation (e.g., yellow lion, blue mermaid). There were two parts
to each Cards game, designed to vary genre from primarily monologue to dialogue.
In the first part of the Cards game, each player’s screen displayed a stack of 9 or
10 cards (Figure A1a). Player A was asked to describe the top card on her pile, while
Player B was asked to search through his pile to find the same card, clicking a button
when he found it. This process was repeated until all cards in Player A’s deck were
matched. In all cases, Player B’s deck contained one additional card that had no match
in Player A’s deck, to ensure that she would need to describe all cards.
In the second part of the Cards game, each player saw a board of 12 cards on the
screen (Figure A1b), all initially face down. As the game began, the first card on one
player’s (the DESCRIBER’s) board was automatically turned face up. The Describer
was told to describe this card to the other player (the SEARCHER), who was to find a
matching card from the cards on his board. If the Searcher could not find a card exactly
matching the Describer’s card, but could find a card depicting one or more of the objects
on that card, the players could decide whether to declare a partial match and receive
points proportional to the numbers of objects matched on the cards. At most three cards
were visible to each player at any time, with cards seen earlier being automatically
turned face down as the game progressed. Players switched roles after each card was
described and the process continued until all cards had been described. The players
were given additional opportunities to earn points, based on other characteristics of the
matched cards, to make the game more interesting and to encourage discussion.
After completing all three instances of the Cards game, subjects were asked to play
a final game, the OBJECTS game. As in the Cards game, all images were selected to
have likely descriptions which were as voiced and sonorant as possible. In the Objects
game, each player’s laptop displayed a game board with 5 to 7 objects (Figure A1c).
Both players saw the same set of objects at the same position on the screen, except for
one (the TARGET). For the DESCRIBER, the target object appeared in a random location
among other objects on the screen; for the FOLLOWER, the target object appeared at the
bottom of the screen. The Describer was instructed to describe the position of the target
object on her screen so that the Follower could move his representation to the same
location on his own screen. After players negotiated what they believed to be their best

The Objects game proceeded through 14 tasks. In the initial four tasks, one of
the subjects always acted as the Describer, and the other one as the Follower. In the
following four tasks their roles were inverted: The subject who played the Describer
role in the initial four tasks was now the Follower, and vice versa. In the final six tasks,
they alternated the roles with each new task.

Thirteen subjects (six women, seven men) participated in the study, which took place in
October 2004 in the Speech Lab at Columbia University. Eleven of the subjects partici-
pated in two sessions on different days, each time with a different partner. All subjects
reported being native speakers of Standard American English and having no hearing
impairments. Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years (mean, 30.0; standard deviation,
10.9), and all subjects lived in the New York City area at the time of the study. They
were contacted through the classified advertisements Web site craigslist.org.
We recorded twelve sessions, each containing an average of 45 minutes of dialogue,
totaling roughly 9 hours of dialogue in the corpus. Of those, 70 minutes correspond to
the first part of the Cards game, 207 minutes to the second part of the Cards game, and
258 minutes to the Objects game. Each subject was recorded on a separate channel of
a DAT recorder, at a sample rate of 48 kHz with 16-bit precision, using a Crown head-
mounted close-talking microphone. Each session was later downsampled to 16 kHz,
16-bit precision, and saved as one stereo .wav file with one player per channel, and also
as two separate mono .wav files, one for each player.
Trained annotators orthographically transcribed the recordings of the Games Cor-
pus and manually aligned the words to the speech signal, yielding a total of 70,259
words and 2,037 unique words in the corpus. Additionally, self repairs and certain non-
word vocalizations were marked, including laughs, coughs, and breaths. Intonational
patterns and other aspects of the prosody were identified using the ToBI transcription
framework (Beckman and Hirschberg 1994; Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg 1994):
Trained annotators intonationally transcribed all of the Objects portion of the corpus
(258 minutes of dialogue) and roughly one third of the Cards portion (90 minutes).

A: of the iron
B: mm-hmBC
A: is past the it’s a little bit past the mermaid’s body
A: when you look at the lower left corner of the iron
B: [okayBC]
A: [where] the turquoise stuff is [and you]
B: [mm-hmBC]
A: know the bottom point out to the farthest left for that region
A: the blinking image is a lawnmower
B: okayBC
A: and it’s gonna go below the yellow lion and above the bl- blue lion
B: mm-hmBC
A: the bottom black part is almost aligned to the white feet of the M&amp;M guy
B: [okayAgr]
A: [yeahPEnd] (end-of-task)
A: okayCBeg um the blinking image is the iron
A: okayCBeg it’s uh the l- I guess the lime that’s blinking
A: nothing lined up real well
B: yeahAgr that’s rightMod

<abstract confidence="0.9968707">We present a series of studies of affirmative cue words—a family of cue words such as “okay” or “alright&amp;quot; that speakers use frequently in conversation. These words pose a challenge for spoken dialogue systems because of their ambiguity: They may be used for agreeing with what the interlocutor has said, indicating continued attention, or for cueing the start of a new topic, among other meanings. We describe differences in the acoustic/prosodic realization of such functions in a corpus of spontaneous, task-oriented dialogues in Standard American English. These results are important both for interpretation and for production in spoken language applications. We also assess the predictive power of computational methods for the automatic disambiguation of these words. We find that contextual information and final intonation figure as the most salient cues to automatic disambiguation.</abstract>

Each session contains an average of 45 minutes of dialogue, totaling roughly 9 hours of dialogue in the corpus. Trained annotators orthographically transcribed the recordings and manually aligned the words to the speech signal, yielding a total of 70,259 words and 2,037 unique words in the corpus. Additionally, self repairs and certain non-word vocalizations were marked, including laughs, coughs, and breaths. For roughly two thirds of the corpus, intonational patterns and other aspects of the prosody were identified by trained annotators using the ToBI transcription framework (Beckman and Hirschberg 1994; Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg 1994). 3.1 Affirmative Cue Words in the Games Corpus Throughout the Games Corpus, subjects made frequent use of affirmative cue words: The 5,456 instances of affirmative cue words alright, gotcha, huh, mm-hm, okay, right, uh-huh, yeah, yep, yes, and yup account for 7.8% of the total words in the corpus. Because the usage of these words seems to vary significantly in meaning, we asked three labelers to independently classify all occurrences of these 11 words in the entire corpus into the ten discourse/pragmatic functions listed in Table 1.

These features also contain information about the target word relative to the other speaker’s speech, including the duration of any overlapping speech, and the latencies between w’s conversational turn and the other speaker’s preceding and subsequent turns. Prosody was annotated following the ToBI system (Beckman and Hirschberg 1994; Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg 1994), which consists of annotations at four timelinked levels of analysis: an orthographic tier of time-aligned words; a tonal tier describing targets in the fundamental frequency (F0) contour; a break index tier indicating degrees of juncture between words; and a miscellaneous tier, in which phenomena such as disfluencies may be optionally marked. The tonal tier describes events such as pitch accents, which make words intonationally prominent and are realized by increased F0 height, loudness, and duration of accented syllables. A given word may be accented</context>

Trained annotators orthographically transcribed the recordings of the Games Corpus and manually aligned the words to the speech signal, yielding a total of 70,259 words and 2,037 unique words in the corpus. Additionally, self repairs and certain nonword vocalizations were marked, including laughs, coughs, and breaths. Intonational patterns and other aspects of the prosody were identified using the ToBI transcription framework (Beckman and Hirschberg 1994; Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg 1994): Trained annotators intonationally transcribed all of the Objects portion of the corpus (258 minutes of dialogue) and roughly one third of the Cards portion (90 minutes).

In our study, prosodic features include the ToBI labels as specified by the annotators, and also a simplified version of the labels, considering only high and low pitch targets (i.e., H* vs. L* for pitch accents, H- vs. L- for phrase accents, and H% vs. L% for boundary tones), and simplified break indices (0–4). These are listed in Table 6. All acoustic features were extracted automatically for the whole corpus using the Praat toolkit (Boersma and Weenink 2001). These include pitch, intensity, stylized pitch, ratio of voiced frames to total frames, jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR) (see Table 7). Pitch features capture how high the speaker’s voice sounds or how low. Intensity is correlated with how loud the speaker sounds to a hearer. The voicedframes ratio roughly approximates the speaking rate. Jitter and shimmer correspond to variability in the frequency and amplitude of vocal-fold vibration, respectively.

Substantial attention has been paid to subsets and supersets of words we include in our class of ACWs in the psycholinguistic literature in studies of grounding— the process by which conversants obtain and maintain a common ground of mutual knowledge, mutual beliefs, and mutual assumptions over the course of a conversation (Clark and Schaefer 1989; Clark and Brennan 1991). Computational work on grounding has been pursued for a number of years by Traum and colleagues (e.g., Traum and Allen 1992; Traum 1994), who recently have described a corpus-based study of lexical and semantic evidence supporting different degrees of grounding (Roque and Traum 2009). Our ACWs often occur in the process of establishing such common ground. Prosodic characteristics of the responses involved in grounding have been studied in the Australian English Map Task corpus by Mushin et al.

The ability to correctly determine the function of cue phrases is critical for important natural language processing tasks, including anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner 1986), argument understanding (Cohen 1984), plan recognition (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Litman and Allen 1987), and discourse segmentation (Litman and Passonneau 1995). * Departamento de Computación, FCEyN, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Pabellón I, Ciudad Universitaria, (C1428EGA) Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA.

Finally, in Section 6 we summarize and discuss our main findings. 2. Previous Work Cue phrases have received extensive attention in the computational linguistics literature. Early work by Cohen (1984) presents a computational justification for the importance of cue phrases in discourse processing. Using a simple propositional framework for analyzing discourse, Cohen claims that, in some cases, cue phrases decrease the number of operations required by the listener to process “coherent transmissions”; in other cases, cue phrases are necessary to allow the recognition of “transmissions which would be incoherent (too complex to reconstruct) in the absence of clues” (page 251).

The most relevant study to ours is that of Stolcke et al.

Besides the binary division of cue phrases into discourse vs. sentential meanings, the Conversational Analysis (CA) literature describes items it terms linguistic feedback or acknowledgments. These include not only the computational linguists’ cue phrases but also expressions such as I see or oh wow, which CA research describes in terms of attention, understanding, and acceptance by the speaker of a proposition uttered by another conversation participant (Kendon 1967; Yngve 1970; Duncan 1972; Schegloff 1982; Jefferson 1984). Such items typically occur at the second position in common adjacency pairs and include backchannels (also referred to as continuers), which “exhibit on the part of [their] producer an understanding that an extended unit of talk is underway by another, and that it is not yet, or may not be (even ought not yet be) complete; [they take] the stance that the speaker of that extended unit should continue talking” (Schegloff 1982, page 81), and agreements, which indicate the speaker’s agreement with a statement or opinion expressed by another speaker.

For our phonetic features (listed in Table 8), we trained an automatic phone recognizer based on the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) (Young et al. 2006), using three corpora as training data: the TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus (Garofolo et al. 1993), the Boston Directions Corpus (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996), and the Columbia Games Corpus. With this recognizer, we obtained automatic timealigned phonetic transcriptions of each instance of alright, mm-hm, okay, right, uh-huh, and yeah in the corpus. To improve accuracy, we restricted the recognizer’s grammar to accept only the most frequent variations of each word, as shown in Table 9. We extracted our phonetic features, such as phone and syllable durations, from the resulting timealigned phonetic transcriptions.

There is also considerable evidence that linguistic feedback does not take place at arbitrary locations in conversation; rather, it mostly occurs at or near transitionrelevance places for turn-taking (Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974; Goodwin 1981).

For example, Hockey (1993) examines the prosodic variation of two ACWs, okay and uh-huh (66 and 77 data points, respectively) produced as full intonational phrases in two spontaneous task-oriented dialogues. She groups the F0 contours visually and auditorily, and shows that instances of okay produced with a high-rise contour are significantly more likely to be followed by speech from the other speaker than from the same speaker. The results of a perception experiment conducted by Gravano et al. (2007) suggest that, in task-oriented American English dialogue, contextual information (e.g., duration of surrounding silence, number of surrounding words) as well as word-final intonation figure as the most salient cues to disambiguation of the function of the word okay by human listeners. Also, in a study of the function of intonation in Scottish English task-oriented dialogue, Kowtko (1996) examines a corpus of 273 instances of single-word utterances, including affirmative cue words such as mmhm, okay, right, uh-huh, and yes.

In previous literature, these constructions have also been termed discourse markers, pragmatic connectives, discourse operators, and clue words. Examples of cue phrases include now, well, so, and, but, then, after all, furthermore, however, in consequence, as a matter offact, in fact, actually, okay, alright, for example, and incidentally. The ability to correctly determine the function of cue phrases is critical for important natural language processing tasks, including anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner 1986), argument understanding (Cohen 1984), plan recognition (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Litman and Allen 1987), and discourse segmentation (Litman and Passonneau 1995). * Departamento de Computación, FCEyN, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Pabellón I, Ciudad Universitaria, (C1428EGA) Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA.

Reichman (1985) proposes a model of discourse structure in which discourse comprises a collection of basic constituents called context spaces, organized hierarchically according to semantic and logical relations called conversational moves. In Reichman’s model, cue phrases are portrayed as mechanisms that signal context space boundaries, specifying the kind of conversational move about to take place. Grosz and Sidner (1986) introduce an alternative model of discourse structure formed by three interrelated 2 Gravano, Hirschberg, and Beˇnuš Affirmative Cue Words in Task-Oriented Dialogue components: a linguistic structure, an intentional structure, and an attentional state. In this model, cue phrases play a central role, allowing the speaker to provide information about all of the following to the listener: 1) that a change of attention is imminent; 2) whether the change returns to a previous focus space or creates a new one; 3) how the intention is related to other intentions; 4) what precedence relationships, if</context>

The L% boundary tone is believed to indicate the opposite of H%, a sense of closure, separating the current phrase from a subsequent one (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990). In our case, by agreeing with what the speaker has said, the listener indicates that enough information has been provided and that any subsequent phrases may refer to a different topic. In other words, such closure might mean that the proposition preceding the ACW has been added to the current context space (Reichman 1985), or that a new focus space is about to be created (Grosz and Sidner 1986). Notably, Agr instances of mm-hm and uh-huh present a very different behavior from the other lexical items, with a distribution of final intonations that closely resembles that of backchannels. In particular, over 60% of the Agr tokens of mm-hm and uh-huh are produced with final rising intonation (either L-H% or H-H%). As we will see in the following sections, the realization of mm-hm and uh-huh as Agr or BC seems to be very similar along several dimensions besides intonation. Alright and okay are the only two ACWs in the corpus that are used to cue the beginning of a new discourse segment, e</context>

In this study, we focus on a subclass of cue phrases that we term affirmative cue words (hereafter, ACWs), and that include alright, mm-hm, okay, right, and uh-huh, inter alia. These words are frequent in spontaneous conversation, especially in task-oriented dialogue, and are heavily overloaded: Their possible discourse/pragmatic functions include agreeing with what the interlocutor has said, displaying interest and continued attention, and cueing the start of a new topic. Some ACWs (e.g., alright, okay) are capable of conveying as many as ten different functions, as described in Section 3. </context>

However, she suggests that cue phrases only display discourse structure relations; they do not create them. In a critique of Schiffrin’s work, Redeker (1991) proposes defining cue phrases as phrases “uttered with the primary function of bringing to the listener’s attention a particular kind of linkage of the upcoming utterance with the immediate discourse context” (page 1169). Prior work on the automatic classification of cue phrases includes a series of studies performed by Hirschberg and Litman (Hirschberg and Litman 1987, 1993; Litman and Hirschberg 1990), which focus on differentiating between the discourse and sentential senses of single-word cue phrases such as now, well, okay, say, and so in American English. When used in a discourse sense, a cue phrase explicitly conveys information about the discourse structure; when used in a sentential sense, a cue phrase instead conveys semantic information. Hirschberg and Litman present two manually developed classification models, one based on prosodic features, and one based on textual features.

Those two contours account for more than 60% of the backchannel instances of mm-hm, okay, uh-huh, and yeah. For the other ACWs there are not enough instances labeled BC in the corpus for statistical comparison. The predominance of H% found for backchannels is consistent with the openness that such boundary tone has been hypothesized to indicate (Hobbs 1990; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990). The utterer of a backchannel understands that (i) there is more to be said, and (ii) it is the speaker holding the conversational turn who must say it. The default function of ACWs, agreement (Agr) is produced most often with falling (L-L%) or plateau final intonation ([!]H-L%) in the case of alright, okay, right, and yeah. The L% boundary tone is believed to indicate the opposite of H%, a sense of closure, separating the current phrase from a subsequent one (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990). In our case, by agreeing with what the speaker has said, the listener indicates that enough inform</context>

Lastly, the only ACW used frequently in the corpus for checking with the interlocutor (the Chk function) is right, as illustrated in the following exchange: A: and the top’s not either, right? B: no A: okay Such instances of right in the corpus normally end in a high-rising pitch contour, or H-H%. This fact is probably explained by the close semantic resemblance of this construction to yes–no questions, which typically end in the same contour type (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990). In addition to the categorical prosodic variables described previously, word final intonation may also be studied by measuring the slope of the word-final pitch track (see Section 3.3 for a description of how pitch slopes are calculated). A high positive value of pitch slope corresponds to a rising intonation; a value close to zero, to a flat intonation; a high negative value, to a falling intonation. Final pitch slope has the advantage of being automatically computable; ToBI labels, on the other hand, still must be 17 Computational Linguistics Volume 38, Number 1 Figure 6 Final pitch slope,</context>

For our phonetic features (listed in Table 8), we trained an automatic phone recognizer based on the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) (Young et al. 2006), using three corpora as training data: the TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus (Garofolo et al. 1993), the Boston Directions Corpus (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996), and the Columbia Games Corpus. With this recognizer, we obtained automatic timealigned phonetic transcriptions of each instance of alright, mm-hm, okay, right, uh-huh, and yeah in the corpus. To improve accuracy, we restricted the recognizer’s grammar to accept only the most frequent variations of each word, as shown in Table 9. We extracted our phonetic features, such as phone and syllable durations, from the resulting timealigned phonetic transcriptions. The remaining five ACWs in our corpus (gotcha, huh, yep, yes, and yup) had too low counts to contain meaningful phonetic variation; thus,</context>

These results are consistent with previous studies of prosodic variation relative to discourse structure, which find intensity to increase at the start of a new topic and decrease at the end (Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy 1980; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). Because by definition CBeg/PBeg ACWs begin a new topic and CEnd/PEnd end one, it is then not surprising to find that the former tend to be produced with higher intensity, and the latter with lower. Finally, for mm-hm and uh-huh we find no significant differences in intensity between their unique functions, agreement (Agr) and backchannel (BC). Recall from the previous section that we find no differences in final intonation either. This further suggests that these two lexical types tend to be produced with similar acoustic/prosodic features, independently of their function. 4.4 Other Features</context>

On the 29 Computational Linguistics Volume 38, Number 1 user’s side, an important reason for not backchanneling may lie in the unnaturalness of such systems, often described as “confusing” or even “intimidating” by users, as well as their inability to recognize backchannels as such. Nonetheless, recent Wizardof-Oz experiments conducted by Hjalmarsson (2009, 2011) show that humans appear to react to turn-management cues produced by a synthetic voice in the same way that they react to cues produced by another human. This important finding suggests that users of spoken dialogue systems could be cued to produce backchannel responses, for example to determine if they are still paying attention. In that case, it will be crucial for systems to be able to distinguish backchannels from other pragmatic functions (Shriberg et al. 1998).

Those two contours account for more than 60% of the backchannel instances of mm-hm, okay, uh-huh, and yeah. For the other ACWs there are not enough instances labeled BC in the corpus for statistical comparison. The predominance of H% found for backchannels is consistent with the openness that such boundary tone has been hypothesized to indicate (Hobbs 1990; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990). The utterer of a backchannel understands that (i) there is more to be said, and (ii) it is the speaker holding the conversational turn who must say it. The default function of ACWs, agreement (Agr) is produced most often with falling (L-L%) or plateau final intonation ([!]H-L%) in the case of alright, okay, right, and yeah. The L% boundary tone is believed to indicate the opposite of H%, a sense of closure, separating the current phrase from a subsequent one (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990).

Some have attempted to model other types of cue phrases (e.g., well, like) or cue phrases in general; others discuss discourse/ pragmatic functions that may be conveyed through ACWs, but which may also be conveyed through other types of expressions (e.g., agreements may be communicated by single words such as yes or longer cue phrases such as that’s correct). Subsets of ACWs have been studied in very small corpora, with some proposals about their prosodic and functional variations. For example, Hockey (1993) examines the prosodic variation of two ACWs, okay and uh-huh (66 and 77 data points, respectively) produced as full intonational phrases in two spontaneous task-oriented dialogues. She groups the F0 contours visually and auditorily, and shows that instances of okay produced with a high-rise contour are significantly more likely to be followed by speech from the other speaker than from the same speaker.

Walker describes some intonational contours which are used to realize IRUs in generation in Walker (1993a) and in Walker (1993b), examining 63 IRU tokens and finding five different types of contour used among them. As part of a larger project on automatically detecting discourse structure for speech recognition and understanding tasks in American English, Jurafsky et al.

The authors examine 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard database (Godfrey, Holliman, and McDaniel 1992), and report that the vast majority of these four dialogue acts are realized with words like yeah, okay, or uh-huh.

Ward and Tsukahara (2000) describe, in both Japanese and American English, a region of low pitch lasting at least 110 msec which may function as a prosodic cue inviting the realization of a backchannel response from the interlocutor. In a corpus study of Japanese dialogues, Koiso et al. (1998) find that both syntax and prosody play a central role in predicting the occurrence of backchannels. Cathcart, Carletta, and Klein (2003) propose a method for automatically predicting the placement of backchannels in Scottish English conversation, based on pause durations and part-of-speech tags, that outperforms a random baseline model. Recently, Gravano and Hirschberg (2009a, 2009b, 2011) describe six distinct prosodic, acoustic, and lexical events in American English speech that tend to precede the occurrence of a backchannel by the interlocutor.

Kowtko finds a significant correlation between discourse function and intonational contour: The align function (which checks that the listener’s understanding aligns with that of the speaker) is shown to correlate with rising intonational contours; the ready function (which cues the speaker’s intention to begin a new task) and the reply-y function (which “has an affirmative surface and usually indicates agreement”; Kowtko 1996, page 59) correlate with a non</context>

Hirschberg and Litman present two manually developed classification models, one based on prosodic features, and one based on textual features. This line of research is further pursued by Litman (1994, 1996), who incorporates machine learning techniques to derive classification models automatically.

Note, however, that comparing these results directly to the results of our classification experiments is difficult because the type of corpora, definitions used, features examined, and/or methodology employed vary greatly among the studies.

For example, in Novick and Sutton’s words, an ACW in turn-initial position is “clearly not serving as a prompt for the other speaker to continue” (page 97). Previous studies on the automatic disambiguation of other types of cue words, such as now, well, or like, present the problem as a binary classification task: Each cue word has either a discourse or a sentential sense (e.g., Litman 1996; Zufferey and Popescu-Belis 2004). In the study of automatic classification of ACWs presented in Section 5 we show that for spoken task-oriented dialogue, the simple discourse/sentential distinction is insufficient. In consequence, we define two new classification tasks besides the general task of classifying any ACW into any function. Our first task, the detection of an acknowledgment function, has important implications for the language management component in spoken dialogue systems, which must keep track of which material has reached mutual belief in a conversation (Bunt, Morante, and Kei</context>

Our SVM models based on lexical, discourse, timing, and acoustic features approach the error rate of trained human labelers in all tasks, while our automatically computed phonetic features offer no improvement. Previous studies indicate that the pragmatic function of ambiguous expressions may be effectively predicted by models that combine information extracted from various sources, including lexical and prosodic (e.g., Litman 1996; Stolcke et al. 2000). Our results support this, and extend the list of useful information sources to include discourse and timing features that may be easily extracted from the time-aligned transcripts. Additionally, our machine learning study includes experiments with several combinations of feature sets, in an attempt to simulate the conditions of different applications. Models that are trained using features extracted only from the speech signal up to the IPU containing the target word simulate on-line applications such as spoken dialogue systems with access to acoustic/prosodic features.</context>

Computational work on grounding has been pursued for a number of years by Traum and colleagues (e.g., Traum and Allen 1992; Traum 1994), who recently have described a corpus-based study of lexical and semantic evidence supporting different degrees of grounding (Roque and Traum 2009). Our ACWs often occur in the process of establishing such common ground. Prosodic characteristics of the responses involved in grounding have been studied in the Australian English Map Task corpus by Mushin et al. (2003), who find that these utterances often consist of acknowledgment contributions such as okay or yeh produced with a “non-final” intonational contour, and followed by speech by the same speaker which appears to continue the intonational phrase. Studies by Walker of informationally redundant utterances (IRUs) (Walker 1992, 1996), utterances which express “a proposition already entailed, presupposed or implicated by a previous utterance in the same discourse situation” (Walker 1993a, page 12), also include some of our ACWs, such as IRU prompts (e.g., uh-huh), which, according to Walker, “add no ne</context>

Novick and Sutton (1994) propose an alternative categorization of linguistic feedback in task-oriented dialogue, which is based on the structural context of exchanges rather than on the characteristics of the preceding utterance. The three main classes in Novick and Sutton’s catalogue are: (i) other → ackn, where an acknowledgment immediately follows a contribution by other speaker; (ii) self → other → ackn, where self initiates an exchange, other eventually completes it, and self utters an acknowledgment; and (iii) self + ackn, where self includes an acknowledgment in an utterance independently of other’s previous c</context>

Those two contours account for more than 60% of the backchannel instances of mm-hm, okay, uh-huh, and yeah. For the other ACWs there are not enough instances labeled BC in the corpus for statistical comparison. The predominance of H% found for backchannels is consistent with the openness that such boundary tone has been hypothesized to indicate (Hobbs 1990; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990). The utterer of a backchannel understands that (i) there is more to be said, and (ii) it is the speaker holding the conversational turn who must say it. The default function of ACWs, agreement (Agr) is produced most often with falling (L-L%) or plateau final intonation ([!]H-L%) in the case of alright, okay, right, and yeah. The L% boundary tone is believed to indicate the opposite of H%, a sense of closure, separating the current phrase from a subsequent one (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990).

Lastly, the only ACW used frequently in the corpus for checking with the interlocutor (the Chk function) is right, as illustrated in the following exchange: A: and the top’s not either, right? B: no A: okay Such instances of right in the corpus normally end in a high-rising pitch contour, or H-H%. This fact is probably explained by the close semantic resemblance of this construction to yes–no questions, which typically end in the same contour type (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990). In addition to the categorical prosodic variables described previously, word final intonation may also be studied by measuring the slope of the word-final pitch track (see Section 3.3 for a description of how pitch slopes are calculated). A high positive value of pitch slope corresponds to a rising intonation; a value close to zero, to a flat intonation; a high negative value, to a falling intonation. Final pitch slope has the advantage of being automatically computable; ToBI labels, on the other hand, still must be 17 Computational Linguistics Volume 38, Number 1 Figure 6 Final pitch slope,</context>

<context position="5900" citStr="Reichman (1985)" startWordPosition="851" endWordPosition="852"> Cue phrases have received extensive attention in the computational linguistics literature. Early work by Cohen (1984) presents a computational justification for the importance of cue phrases in discourse processing. Using a simple propositional framework for analyzing discourse, Cohen claims that, in some cases, cue phrases decrease the number of operations required by the listener to process “coherent transmissions”; in other cases, cue phrases are necessary to allow the recognition of “transmissions which would be incoherent (too complex to reconstruct) in the absence of clues” (page 251). Reichman (1985) proposes a model of discourse structure in which discourse comprises a collection of basic constituents called context spaces, organized hierarchically according to semantic and logical relations called conversational moves. In Reichman’s model, cue phrases are portrayed as mechanisms that signal context space boundaries, specifying the kind of conversational move about to take place. Grosz and Sidner (1986) introduce an alternative model of discourse structure formed by three interrelated 2 Gravano, Hirschberg, and Beˇnuš Affirmative Cue Words in Task-Oriented Dialogue components: a linguist</context>

The L% boundary tone is believed to indicate the opposite of H%, a sense of closure, separating the current phrase from a subsequent one (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990). In our case, by agreeing with what the speaker has said, the listener indicates that enough information has been provided and that any subsequent phrases may refer to a different topic. In other words, such closure might mean that the proposition preceding the ACW has been added to the current context space (Reichman 1985), or that a new focus space is about to be created (Grosz and Sidner 1986). Notably, Agr instances of mm-hm and uh-huh present a very different behavior from the other lexical items, with a distribution of final intonations that closely resembles that of backchannels. In particular, over 60% of the Agr tokens of mm-hm and uh-huh are produced with final rising intonation (either L-H% or H-H%). As we will see in the following sections, the realization of mm-hm and uh-huh as Agr or BC seems to be very similar along several dimensions besides intonation.

Computational work on grounding has been pursued for a number of years by Traum and colleagues (e.g., Traum and Allen 1992; Traum 1994), who recently have described a corpus-based study of lexical and semantic evidence supporting different degrees of grounding (Roque and Traum 2009). Our ACWs often occur in the process of establishing such common ground. Prosodic characteristics of the responses involved in grounding have been studied in the Australian English Map Task corpus by Mushin et al. (2003), who find that these utterances often consist of acknowledgment contributions such as okay or yeh produced with a “non-final” intonational contour, and followed by speech by the same speaker which appears to continue the intonational phrase.

In the study of automatic classification of ACWs presented in Section 5 we show that for spoken task-oriented dialogue, the simple discourse/sentential distinction is insufficient. In consequence, we define two new classification tasks besides the general task of classifying any ACW into any function. Our first task, the detection of an acknowledgment function, has important implications for the language management component in spoken dialogue systems, which must keep track of which material has reached mutual belief in a conversation (Bunt, Morante, and Keizer 2007; Roque and Traum 2009). Our second task, the detection of a discourse segment boundary function, should help in discourse segmentation and meeting processing tasks (Litman and Passonneau 1995). Our SVM models based on lexical, discourse, timing, and acoustic features approach the error rate of trained human labelers in all tasks, while our automatically computed phonetic features offer no improvement. Previous studies indicate that the pragmatic function of ambiguous expressions may be effectively predicted by models that combine information extracted from various sources, including lexical and prosodic (e.g., Litm</context>

Besides the binary division of cue phrases into discourse vs. sentential meanings, the Conversational Analysis (CA) literature describes items it terms linguistic feedback or acknowledgments. These include not only the computational linguists’ cue phrases but also expressions such as I see or oh wow, which CA research describes in terms of attention, understanding, and acceptance by the speaker of a proposition uttered by another conversation participant (Kendon 1967; Yngve 1970; Duncan 1972; Schegloff 1982; Jefferson 1984). Such items typically occur at the second position in common adjacency pairs and include backchannels (also referred to as continuers), which “exhibit on the part of [their] producer an understanding that an extended unit of talk is underway by another, and that it is not yet, or may not be (even ought not yet be) complete; [they take] the stance that the speaker of that extended unit should continue talking” (Schegloff 1982, page 81), and agreements, which indicate the speaker’s agreement with a statement or opinion expressed by another speaker.

In this model, cue phrases play a central role, allowing the speaker to provide information about all of the following to the listener: 1) that a change of attention is imminent; 2) whether the change returns to a previous focus space or creates a new one; 3) how the intention is related to other intentions; 4) what precedence relationships, if any, are relevant (page 196). In a corpus study of spontaneous conversations, Schiffrin (1987) describes cue phrases as syntactically detachable from a sentence, commonly used in initial position within utterances, capable of operating at both local and global levels of discourse, and having a range of prosodic contours. As other authors, Schiffrin observes that cue phrases provide contextual coordinates for an utterance in the discourse—that is, they indicate the discourse segment to which an utterance belongs. However, she suggests that cue phrases only display discourse structure relations; they do not create them. In a critique of Schiffrin’s work, Redeker (1991) proposes defining </context>

Litman describes the automatic classification of cue words in general (including, e.g., now, well, say, and so), classifying these into discourse and sentential uses using a corpus of monologue. In this classification task, which is not performed in our study, the best results are reached by decision-tree learners trained on prosodic and text-based features, with an error rate of 13.8%. The most relevant study to ours is that of Stolcke et al. (2000), which presents experiments on the automatic disambiguation of dialogue acts (DA) on 1,155 spontaneous telephone conversations from the Switchboard corpus, labeled using the DAMSL (Dialogue Act Markup in Several Layers) annotation scheme (Core and Allen 1997). For the subtask of identifying the Agreement and Backchannels tags collapsed together, the authors report an error rate of 27.1% when using prosodic features, 19.0% when using features extracted from the text, and 15.3% when using all features. Other DA classifications also include some of the functions of ACWs discussed in our current </context>

Studies by Walker of informationally redundant utterances (IRUs) (Walker 1992, 1996), utterances which express “a proposition already entailed, presupposed or implicated by a previous utterance in the same discourse situation” (Walker 1993a, page 12), also include some of our ACWs, such as IRU prompts (e.g., uh-huh), which, according to Walker, “add no new propositional content to the common ground” (Walker 1993a, page 32). Walker adopts the term “continuer” from the Conversational Analysis school to further describe these prompts (Walker 1993a). Walker describes some intonational contours which are used to realize IRUs in generation in Walker (1993a) and in Walker (1993b), examining 63 IRU tokens and finding five different types of contour used among them.

They also show that prosodic features (including duration, pause, and intensity) can aid the automatic disambiguation between these two classes: A classifier trained using both lexical and prosodic features slightly yet significantly outperforms one trained using just lexical features. There is also considerable evidence that linguistic feedback does not take place at arbitrary locations in conversation; rather, it mostly occurs at or near transitionrelevance places for turn-taking (Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974; Goodwin 1981). Ward and Tsukahara (2000) describe, in both Japanese and American English, a region of low pitch lasting at least 110 msec which may function as a prosodic cue inviting the realization of a backchannel response from the interlocutor. In a corpus study of Japanese dialogues, Koiso et al. (1998) find that both syntax and prosody play a central role in predicting the occurrence of backchannels. Cathcart, Carletta, and Klein (2003) propose a method for automatically predicting the placement of backchannels in Scottish English conversation, based on pause durations and part-of-speech tags, that outperforms a random baselin</context>

Interactions between state-of-the-art spoken dialogue systems and their users appear to contain very few instances of backchannel responses from either conversational partner. On the system’s side, the absence of this important element of spoken communication may be due to the difficulty of detecting appropriate moments where a backchannel response would be welcome by the user. Recent advances on that research topic (Ward and Tsukahara 2000; Cathcart, Carletta, and Klein 2003; Gravano and Hirschberg 2009a) have encouraged research on ways to equip systems with the ability to signal to the user that the system is still listening (Maatman, Gratch, and Marsella 2005; Bevacqua, Mancini, and Pelachaud 2008; Morency, de Kok, and Gratch 2008)— for example, when the user is asked to enter large amounts of information. On the 29 Computational Linguistics Volume 38, Number 1 user’s side, an important reason for not backchanneling may lie in the unnaturalness of such systems, often described as “confusing” or even “intimidating” by users, </context>

We refer to this process as gender normalization. All other normalizations were calculated using z-scores: z = (x − R)/u, where x is a raw measurement to be normalized (e.g., the duration of a particular word), and R and u are the mean and standard deviation of a certain population (e.g., all instances of the same word by the same speaker in the whole conversation). For our phonetic features (listed in Table 8), we trained an automatic phone recognizer based on the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) (Young et al. 2006), using three corpora as training data: the TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus (Garofolo et al. 1993), the Boston Directions Corpus (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996), and the Columbia Games Corpus. With this recognizer, we obtained automatic timealigned phonetic transcriptions of each instance of alright, mm-hm, okay, right, uh-huh, and yeah in the corpus. To improve accuracy, we restricted the recognizer’s grammar to accept only the most frequent variations of each word, as shown in Table 9.

Hirschberg and Litman present two manually developed classification models, one based on prosodic features, and one based on textual features. This line of research is further pursued by Litman (1994, 1996), who incorporates machine learning techniques to derive classification models automatically. Litman uses different combinations of prosodic and text-based features to train decision-tree and rule learners, and shows that machine learning constitutes a powerful tool for developing automatic classifiers of cue phrases into their sentential and discourse uses. Zufferey and Popescu-Belis (2004) present a similar study on the automatic classification of like and well into discourse and sentential senses, achieving a performance close to that of human annotators. Besides the binary division of cue phrases into discourse vs. sentential meanings, the Conversational Analysis (CA) literature describes items it terms linguistic feedback or acknowledgments.

Such large differences bring support to Novick and Sutton’s (1994) claim that the discourse/ pragmatic role of these expressions strongly depends on their basic structural context. For example, in Novick and Sutton’s words, an ACW in turn-initial position is “clearly not serving as a prompt for the other speaker to continue” (page 97). Previous studies on the automatic disambiguation of other types of cue words, such as now, well, or like, present the problem as a binary classification task: Each cue word has either a discourse or a sentential sense (e.g., Litman 1996; Zufferey and Popescu-Belis 2004). In the study of automatic classification of ACWs presented in Section 5 we show that for spoken task-oriented dialogue, the simple discourse/sentential distinction is insufficient. In consequence, we define two new classification tasks besides the general task of classifying any ACW into any function. Our first task, the detection of an acknowledgment function, has important implications for the language management component in spoken dialogue systems, which must keep track of which material has reached mutual belief in a conversation (Bunt, Morante, and Keizer 2007; Roque and Traum 2009).
