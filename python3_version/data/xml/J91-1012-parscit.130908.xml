Offering an inquiry into the nature
of language from the perspective of
computing, Computers and Human Language
synthesizes recent research in linguistics,
computer science, and experimental
psychology as it explores the major com-
putational approaches to language.
Among the topics considered are the computationally tractable,
symbolic basis of language, the mental lexicon as repository of knowledge,
the elegantly recursive structure of syntax, and the compositional nature
of meanings, together with the segmentation, focus, and hierarchical
construction of extended discourse. This text also explores such up-to-
the-minute subjects as neurally-inspired computing, parsing and psycho-
logical plausibility, the controversial representation hypothesis, and the
ramifications of discourse &amp;quot;focus.&amp;quot; With its clear, engaging style and
gradual, systematic exposition, Computers and Human Language makes
the fast-moving world of computational linguistics accessible to the
beginning student.

Natural language generation research
has been boosted in the past decade by
an increased engagement in the prob-
lems of constructing coherent and pur-
poseful texts with computers. In the
course of this research many linguistic
formalisms have been adopted. This
book provides a snapshot of the state
of the art in natural language. It gathers
the leading U.S. and European NLG
researchers and sets them in the context
of five themes—text planning, linguis-
tic realism, building realization, build-
ing descriptions, and connectionist
approaches.

THE ACL-MIT PRESS SERIES in
NATURAL LANGUAGE
PROCESSING
Aravind Joshi, Karen Sparch Jones, Mark Y Liberman,
Editors
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9945668">
The ACL Series will offer books of high quality in the field of
natural language processing, including human and machine
speech production and understanding. It will cover a wide range
of topics, both theoretical and applied, which should interest
researchers not only in computational linguistics, but also in
formal linguistics.
The Series will include specially commissioned volumes, re-
search monographs, textbooks, and on occasion, collections of
high quality papers with clear unifying themes compiled under
the editorship of distinguished researchers.
The MIT Press publishes the ACL journal, Computational Lin-
guistics. The Press also has a strong list in formal linguistics and
publishes the journal Linguistic Inquiry.
Submissions for the ACL Series should be directed to one of the Editors, or to
Henry Bradford Stanton at The MIT Press

ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for
renewals made after 1 March; this fee does not apply to new members. Institutions now subscribe to the journal

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97531775">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be, submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced ,throughout including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.924363">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98491">
Paper: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subjeCt area. The submission of an article to CL or refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication&amp;quot;
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Technical Correspondence: This category includes short articles reporting preliminary,results
of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest to the readership. Tech-
nical correspondence should not generally exceed eight double-spaced pages. Each technical
correspondence is reviewed, by at least two members of the editorial board before acceptance.
Letters to the Editor: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership.
The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for
inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, and Generation have been formed; others are likely to be added.

<abstract confidence="0.904322818181818">an inquiry into the nature of language from the perspective of and Human Language synthesizes recent research in linguistics, computer science, and experimental psychology as it explores the major computational approaches to language. Among the topics considered are the computationally tractable, symbolic basis of language, the mental lexicon as repository of knowledge, the elegantly recursive structure of syntax, and the compositional nature of meanings, together with the segmentation, focus, and hierarchical construction of extended discourse. This text also explores such up-tothe-minute subjects as neurally-inspired computing, parsing and psychological plausibility, the controversial representation hypothesis, and the ramifications of discourse &amp;quot;focus.&amp;quot; With its clear, engaging style and systematic exposition, and Human Language the fast-moving world of computational linguistics accessible to the beginning student. 1991 496 pp.; 87 illus. paper $16.95 cloth $39.95 Prices and publication dates are subject to change.

MJWSS —14031. Natural language generation research has been boosted in the past decade by an increased engagement in the problems of constructing coherent and purposeful texts with computers. In the course of this research many linguistic formalisms have been adopted. This book provides a snapshot of the state of the art in natural language. It gathers the leading U.S. and European NLG researchers and sets them in the context of five themes—text planning, linguistic realism, building realization, building descriptions, and connectionist approaches. 1-800-321-5068 This publication is available in microform.</abstract>
