With the explosion in the quantity of on-
line information in recent years, automatic
abstracting and indexing has received re-
newed interest and a number of promising
approaches have emerged. The goal of this
book is to present a complete description of
current indexing and abstracting techniques
in the context of the underlying linguistic
and statistical knowledge.
The book has three parts: the indexing and
abstracting environment, methods of auto-
matic indexing and abstracting, and appli-
cations. The first part covers theories about
text, such as rhetorical and thematic struc-
ture, and discusses the use of different text
representations for information retrieval and
abstraction. The second part of the book
deals with lexical analysis and weighting
schemes, abstraction, and evaluation tech-
niques. The third part describes two sum-
marization systems developed by the author:
a summarizer for court cases and a generic
magazine article summarizer.
I found the application part particularly in-
teresting because it describes all the stages
of the development of applied summariza-
tion systems, from the initial corpus analysis
to the final evaluation of the method. The
system developed by the author combines
symbolic techniques, such as a text grammar,
with statistical methods, such as classifica-
tion and clustering. The system demonstrates
tradeoffs between symbolic techniques based
on manual knowledge encoding and corpus-
based shallow methods.
However, the book&apos;s breadth comes at the
expense of its depth. This problem is espe-
cially acute in the first two parts of the book,
which are supposed to give an overview
of the subject. The presentation of text the-
ories and abstraction techniques is some-
what superficial and incomplete; the book
is not up to date and does not contain the
latest developments in the area. For exam-
ple, it omits computational methods for dis-
course; cohesion-based approaches; segmen-
tation algorithms; and recent work in eval-
uation, corpus-based summarization, and re-
generation (e.g, Marcu 1997; Mani et al. 1998;
Jing and McKeown 1999). These limitations
can be a major hurdle for the reader who
wants to learn about state-of-the-art devel-
opments.—Regina Barzilay, Columbia Univer-
sity
