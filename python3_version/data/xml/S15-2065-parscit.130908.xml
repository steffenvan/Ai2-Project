This paper describes clinical disorder
recognition and encoding system submit-
ted by IHS R&amp;D Belarus team at the
SemEval-2015 shared task related to
analysis of clinical texts. Our system is
based on IHS Goldfire Linguistic Proces-
sor and uses a rich set of lexical, syntac-
tic and semantic features. The proposed
system consists of two components: a
CRF-based approach to recognize disor-
der entities and empirical ranking to en-
code disorders to UMLS CUIs. Evalua-
tion on the test data set showed that our
system achieved the F-measure of 0.898
for entity recognition and the F-measure
of 0.794 for UMLS CUI. The combined
score for whole task is 0.690 (rank 17 out
of 40 submissions).

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998766">
Named entity recognition (NER) is an infor-
mation extraction task where the aim is to identi-
fy mentions of specific types of entities in text.
This task has been one of the main focuses in the
biomedical text mining research field, especially
when applied to the scientific literature. Such
efforts have led to the development of various
tools for the recognition of diverse entities, in-
cluding species names, genes and proteins,
chemicals and drugs, anatomical concepts and
diseases. These tools use methods based on dic-
tionaries, rules, and machine learning, or a com-
bination of those depending on the specificities
and requirements of each concept type (Campos
et al., 2013). After identifying entities occurring
in texts, it is also relevant to disambiguate those
entities and associate each occurrence with a
specific concept, using a univocal identifier from
a reference database such as Uniprot1 for pro-
teins, or OMIM2 for genetic disorders. This is
usually performed by matching the identified
entities against a knowledge-base, possibly
evaluating the textual context in which the entity
occurred to identify the best matching concept.
In this paper, we describe a system
(IHS_RD_Belarus in official results) developed
to participate in the international shared task
organized by the Conference on Semantic Evalu-
ation Exercises (SemEval-2015) and focused on
the analysis of clinical notes. This task is the
repetition of task 7 at SemEval-2014 (Pradhan, et
al., 2014) and aims at the recognition of entities
belonging to the ‘disorders’ semantic group of
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
(Bodenreider, 2004) and normalization of these
entities to a specific UMLS Concept Unique
Identifier (CUI). Specifically, the task definition
required that concepts should only be normalized
to CUIs that could be mapped to the SNOMED
CT3 terminology.

<bodyText confidence="0.999911583333333">
The dataset for Tasks 1 consists of de-identified
clinical notes of 4 different types (Discharge
summary, ECG, Echo, Radiology) from MIMIC
corpus (Lee et al., 2011). The organizer annotat-
ed 298 clinical notes with disorder entities on a
predefined guideline and then mapped them to
SNOMED-CT concepts represented by the
UMLS CUIs. If a disorder entity cannot be found
in SNOMED-CT, it was marked as “CUI-less”.
These notes were used as training dataset. The
unlabelled notes are provided for exploring semi-
supervised and unsupervised methods.

Two types of disorder mentions are annotated:
consecutive and discontiguous. The discontigu-

with some distance between each other, for ex-
ample, “The left atrium is moderately dilated”.

2.4 Disorder identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975">
We formulated disorder mention identification as
a sequence labeling problem at token level and
used Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Laffer-
ty, 2001). CRFs have shown empirical successes
recently in named entity recognition (McCallum
and Li, 2003), opinion target extraction (Cher-
nyshevich, 2014), noun phrase segmentation
(Sha and Pereira, 2003).
To facilitate feature generation for supervised
CRF learning, sentences were pre-processed with
IHS Goldfire Linguistic Processor that performs
the following operations: word splitting, part-of-
speech tagging, parsing, noun phrase extraction,
semantic role labeling within expanded Subject-
Action-Object (eSAO) relations (Todhunter et
al., 2010). We removed all footers and headers,
which are associated with the whole document
and are irrelevant for the task. The notes are de-
identified: the private data, e.g. names, data and
places, are replaced by placeholders, for exam-
ple, “[**Location**]”. We replaced these
placeholders with natural language expressions
to assure correct POS-tagging and parsing.
Two separate CRF models were trained to
identify consecutive and discontiguous disorder
mentions with the same tagging scheme and
same set of features.

2.4.1 CRF labels
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999496222222222">
We conducted several experiments with dif-
ferent tagging conventions and decided to use the
ILO (Inside-Last-Outside) tagging scheme,
where tag I represents the beginning and the in-
side token of an entity, L represents the last word
of entity and O not a member of a disorder struc-
ture. The following is an example of our tagging
for consecutive and discontiguous disorder men-
tions:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99579425">

scheme showed the classification accuracy lower
by 5.5%.

2.4.2 Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985536675675676">
Given a sentence s and a token under considera-
tion wk, we define features over wk and window
of 5 tokens: wk-2, wk-1, wk, wk+1, wk+2.
Token: This feature represents the string of
the token wk.
Context features: This feature has been used
with a window of five tokens (the 2 tokens be-
fore and the 2 tokens after the target token). The
surrounding words usually convey useful infor-
mation about a token which help in predicting
the correct tag for each token.
Part of speech: This feature represents the
POS tag of the token wk. It can provide some
means of lexical disambiguation and help in de-
termining the boundaries of instances.
Word letter case feature: This feature in-
cludes one of the three case tags for lowercase,
uppercase and capitalized words corresponding-
ly.
Letter n-grams: 3- and 4-letter n-grams start-
ing and ending the token wk.
Word frequency in out-of-domain corpus:
we used social media texts as an out-of-domain
corpus.
Part of a longer noun phrase: whether the
word belongs to the same noun group as the next
word.
Semantic category: This feature represents
the semantic class to which the token wk belongs,
for example, body part, process, units of meas-
ure, drug, and animal being. We used two
sources of semantic information: WordNet and
the UMLS. The UMLS provides a set of seman-
tic groups like anatomic terms, chemical sub-
stances and drugs, devices, disorders, etc. The
WordNet was used to define semantic category
of words not found in the UMLS. We selected
the most representative nodes, for example,
physical property, human, process etc. and all
subordinate terms were assumed to belong to the
appropriate category.
Document section: This unigram feature as-
signs the id of the section in which the token wk
belongs. Many clinical notes are divided into
sections. These section headers provide very use-
ful information, for example, the section “Past
Medical History” or “Diagnosis” contains a lot
of disorder mentions, while “Medications” do
not. We created list of section headers, mapped
to about 80 different unified names.
UMLS Features: We performed lookup in the
disorder lexicon at two levels: word level and
phrase level.
• The word-level feature represents the proba-
bility of a separate word to occur in a disor-
der mention. For this purpose, we collected
all words contained in the UMLS disorders
and calculated their probabilities of being a
part of a disorder mention using the TF-IDF
weighting. The TF of each word in the train-
ing set is calculated as the number of times
the corresponding token appears in the
UMLS disorder terminology. The IDF for
each word is calculated from the number of
unlabelled notes, which contain the word.
These weighted metrics show how important
the word is for disorder identification and
help to exclude a lot of common words like
frequent adjectives or conjunctions that often
appear both in disorder terms and other
terms.
• The phrase-level feature marks all phrases
(with more than 2 words) that match a disor-
der term.

In this work we did not address the problem of
discontiguous disorder mentions and correctly
identified only about 10% of all discontiguous
disorder mentions. Another source of errors are
the one-, two-letters disorder acronyms, for ex-
ample, “N”, “V”, “BM”, etc. They remain un-
tagged as diseases, as they may also refer to
other entities, for example, chemicals.
As for disorder normalization task, the most
challenging problem is the abbreviation disam-
biguation. The primary reason is a lack of abbre-
viations in UMLS terminology and their high
ambiguity, for example, “AS” can refer to “An-
gelman Syndrome”, “Aortic Stenosis”, “Alz-
heimer Sclerosis” etc.

<bodyText confidence="0.999952384615385">
In this paper, we presented a clinical analysis
system designed for participation in Task 1a of
the SemEval 2015 Task 14 challenge. Our sys-
tem performance was at 0.69 F-measure in the
strict evaluation context and 0.714 F-measure in
the relaxed evaluation context, obtaining a mid-
range position. Our disorder recognition system
presents good precision but performs worse in
terms of recall, especially in discontiguous men-
tions identification. In order to improve our dis-
order normalization we plan to develop context
similarity measures and improve the abbreviation
disambiguation.

Specifically, the task definition required that concepts should only be normalized to CUIs that could be mapped to the SNOMED CT3 terminology. 2 System description 2.1 Dataset The dataset for Tasks 1 consists of de-identified clinical notes of 4 different types (Discharge summary, ECG, Echo, Radiology) from MIMIC corpus (Lee et al., 2011). The organizer annotated 298 clinical notes with disorder entities on a predefined guideline and then mapped them to SNOMED-CT concepts represented by the UMLS CUIs. If a disorder entity cannot be found in SNOMED-CT, it was marked as “CUI-less”. These notes were used as training dataset. The unlabelled notes are provided for exploring semisupervised and unsupervised methods. 380 Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2015), pages 380–384, Denver, Colorado, June 4-5, 2015. c�2015 Association for Computational Linguistics Two types of disorder mentions are</context>

The predicted mention is a false positive if the span shares no words with the gold-standard span or the CUI is incorrect. 2.4 Disorder identification We formulated disorder mention identification as a sequence labeling problem at token level and used Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty, 2001). CRFs have shown empirical successes recently in named entity recognition (McCallum and Li, 2003), opinion target extraction (Chernyshevich, 2014), noun phrase segmentation (Sha and Pereira, 2003). To facilitate feature generation for supervised CRF learning, sentences were pre-processed with IHS Goldfire Linguistic Processor that performs the following operations: word splitting, part-ofspeech tagging, parsing, noun phrase extraction, semantic role labeling within expanded SubjectAction-Object (eSAO) relations (Todhunter et al., 2010). We removed all footers and headers, which are associated with the whole document and are irrelevant for the task. The notes are deidentified: the private data, e.g. names, data and places, are replaced by placeholders, for example, “[**Location**]”. We </context>

In this paper, we describe a system (IHS_RD_Belarus in official results) developed to participate in the international shared task organized by the Conference on Semantic Evaluation Exercises (SemEval-2015) and focused on the analysis of clinical notes. This task is the repetition of task 7 at SemEval-2014 (Pradhan, et al., 2014) and aims at the recognition of entities belonging to the ‘disorders’ semantic group of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Bodenreider, 2004) and normalization of these entities to a specific UMLS Concept Unique Identifier (CUI).
