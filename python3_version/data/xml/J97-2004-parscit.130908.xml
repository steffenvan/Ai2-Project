This paper presents an algorithm capable of identifying the translation for each word in a bilingual
corpus. Previously proposed methods rely heavily on word-based statistics. Under a word-based
approach, frequent words with a consistent translation can be aligned at a high rate of precision.
However, words that are less frequent or exhibit diverse translations generally do not have sta-
tistically significant evidence for confident alignment, thereby leading to incomplete or incorrect
alignments. The algorithm proposed herein attempts to broaden coverage by exploiting lexico-
graphic resources. To this end, we draw on the two classification systems of words in Longman
Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE) and Tongyici Cilin (Synonym Forest, CILIN). Au-
tomatically acquired class-based alignment rules are used to compensate for what is lacking in a
bilingual dictionary such as the English-Chinese version of the Longman Dictionary of Contem-
porary English (LecDOCE). In addition, this alignment method is implemented using LecDOCE
examples and their translations for training and testing, while further examples from a technical
manual in both English and Chinese are used for an open test. Quantitative results of the closed
and open tests are also summarized.

Brown, Cocke, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Jelinek, Lafferty, Mercer, and Roosin (1990)
advocate a statistical approach to machine translation (MT) and initiate much of the
recent interest in bilingual corpora. Statistical machine translation (SMT) can be un-
derstood as a word-by-word model consisting of two submodels: a language model
for generating a source text segment S and a translation model for mapping S to its
translation T. They recommend using a bilingual corpus to train the parameters of
translation probability, Pr(S j T) in the translation model. For MT and other pur-
poses, many methods have been proposed for sentence alignment of the Hansards,
an English-French corpus of Canadian parliamentary debates (Brown, Lai, and Mer-
cer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Simard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993; Gale
and Church 1993), and for other language pairs, including English-German, English-
Chinese, and English-Japanese (Kay and Roscheisen 1993; Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung,
Helfman, and Satish 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Wu 1994). Alignment at other
levels of resolution is obviously useful. A section, paragraph, sentence, phrase, col-
location, or word can be aligned to its translation (Kupiec 1993; Smadja, McKeown,
and Hatzivassiloglou 1996). Other logical approaches involve aligning parse trees of
a sentence and its translation (Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993; Meyers, Yan-
garber, and Grishman 1996), or simultaneously generating parse trees and alignment
arrangements (Wu 1995).

In addition to machine translation, many applications for aligned corpora have
been suggested, including machine-aided translation (Shemtov 1993), translation as-
sessment and critiquing tools (Isabelle 1992; des Tombe and Armstrong-Warwick 1993;
Macklovitch 1994), text generation (Smadja 1992; Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivas-
siloglou 1996), bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990; Church and
Gale 1991; Daille, Gaussier, and Lange 1994; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993; Li 1994;
Wu and Xia 1994), and word-sense disambiguation (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992;
Chang, Chen, Sheng, and Ker 1996). For these applications, we must go one step fur-
ther from sentence alignment and identify alignment at the word level. In the process
of word alignment, the translation of each source word is identified. This study con-
centrates primarily on identifying alignment at the word level for a given sentence
and its translation.
In the context of SMT, Brown et al. (1993) present a series of five models of Pr(S I T)
for word alignment. Model 1 assumes that Pr(S I T) depends only on lexical transla-
tion probability (LTP) t(s I t), that is, the probability that the ith word s in S translates
into the jth word t in T. The pair of words (s, t), or more precisely (s, t,i,j) since there
could be more than one instance of s or t, is called a connection. Model 2 enhances
Model 1 by considering the dependence of Pr(S I T) on the distortion probability (DP)
d(i 11,1, m) where 1 and m are the respective lengths of S and T measured in number of
words. Brown et al. (1990) propose using an adaptive Expectation and Maximization
(EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters for LTP and DP from a bilingual corpus.
The EM algorithm iterates between two phases to estimate LTP and DP until both
functions converge. In the expectation phase, the parameters t(s I t) and d(i Ii,!, m) in
the SMT model for all possible values of s, t, j, 1, and m are estimated from the sample
of an aligned bilingual corpus. In the maximization phase, each sentence-translation
pair in the corpus is aligned by maximizing the translation probability, Pr(S 1 T). They
examine the feasibility of aligning the English-French Hansards corpus using the SMT
model, on both the sentence level and the word level. The SMT model is then tested
for the task of machine translation. The model produces 35 acceptable translations for
73 sentences. However, to our knowledge, the degree of success of word alignment
has not yet been explored.
Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993) observe that reliably distinguishing sentence
boundaries for a noisy bilingual text scanned by an OCR device is quite difficult. In
such a circumstance, they recommend aligning words directly without the preprocess-
ing phase of sentence alignment. Under that proposal, a rough character-by-character
alignment is first performed. Based on the character alignment, words are subsequently
aligned based on a modified version of Brown et al.&apos;s Model 2. The authors report
that 60.5% of 65,000 words in a noisy document are correctly aligned. For 84% of the
words, the offset from correct alignment is at most 3.
Gale and Church (1991b) present an alternative algorithm that does not estimate
and store probabilities for all word pairs to reduce memory requirement and to ensure
robustness of probability estimation. Instead, for each source word s, only a handful of
target words strongly associated with s are found and stored. Such a task is achieved
by applying a x2-like statistic. They report that the method produces highly precise
(95%) alignment for 61% of the words in the 800 sentences tested.
This paper is motivated by the following observations: First, the above survey
clearly reveals that word-based methods offer only limited coverage even after they
are trained with an extremely large bilingual corpus. Second, we believe that for most
applications, low coverage is just as serious as low precision. For aligned corpora to
be useful for NLP tasks such as machine translation and word-sense disambiguation,
a coverage rate higher than 60% is desirable, even at the expense of a slightly lower
precision rate.

This paper presents a word alignment algorithm based on classification in existing
thesauri. The proposed algorithm, called ClassAlign, relies on an automatic procedure
to acquire class-based alignment rules; it does not employ word-by-word translation
probabilities, nor does it use an iterative EM algorithm for estimating such proba-
bilities. Experimental results indicate that classification based on existing thesauri is
highly effective in broadening coverage while maintaining a high precision rate.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we briefly discuss the
nature of text and translation that justifies a class-based approach. A set of three al-
gorithms leading to class-based alignment are outlined in Section 3. The algorithms&apos;
effectiveness is demonstrated through examples and their translations in the LecDOCE
(Longman Group 1992), a bilingual version of the Longman Dictionary of Contempo-
rary English (LDOCE, Proctor 1988), as well as sentences from bilingual texts in the
LightShip User&apos;s Guide (Pilot Software Inc. 1993; Galaxy Software Services 1994). The
experiments we undertook to assess the performance of these algorithms are the topic
of Section 4. Quantitative experimental results are also summarized. In Section 5, we
analyze the experimental results and consider ways in which the proposed algorithms
might be extended and improved. Concluding remarks are made in Section 6.

2. Text and Translation as a Class-to-Class Mapping
</sectionHeader>

The discussion in Section 1 indicates the limitations of statistical methods. As an
alternative, we examine the feasibility of using an everyday bilingual dictionary in
machine-readable form for word alignment. With tens of thousands of headword-and-
translation pairs that can be used to propose high-precision connections, a bilingual
machine-readable dictionary (MRD) surprisingly leads to even lower coverage than a
statistically-derived lexicon. Below, observations are made to account for the reason
why a substantial portion of translations deviate from what is listed in the bilingual
MRD or what is statistically probable. Such deviations inhibit word-based methods
from achieving broad coverage. We contend that a word&apos;s translational deviation is
mostly bounded within the relevant semantic classes, thus justifying a class-based
approach to word alignment.

2.1 Diverse In-Context Translations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954555555555">
Given that the translations for a headword (dictionary translations, DTs for short) can
be extracted from a bilingual MRD such as the LecDOCE, a word in S can be aligned
at a high precision rate with its DTs found in T. Headword-and-translation pairs are
a reliable knowledge source for word alignment. However, they cover only a small
part of the connections in an average sentence and its translation. Our experiments
reveal that the translations of a word in context (in-context translations, ICTs for short)
are frequently more diversified than the offerings in an everyday bilingual dictionary.
More specifically, less than 30% of the English words in the context of LecDOCE
examples translate into one of the relevant DTs in the same dictionary.
Translations in an everyday dictionary are meant to provide the reader with the
idea of what is implied by the headword out of context; they are frequently more of
an explanation than a translation. For instance, one LecDOCE sense entry defines the
word boy as &apos;infml esp. AmE a male person, of any age, from a given place&apos; and gives
M 93.A. (modi lai zhi nanren) as the translation relevant to this particular sense.
Such a &apos;translation&apos; per se seems unlikely to appear as the ICT of boy. Aside from this
fundamental difference, behind the disparity between DT and ICT are a plethora of
factors. These include (1) a failure on the dictionary&apos;s (or the statistically derived lexi-
con&apos;s) part to cover a needed word sense, (2) mismatches in sense specificity between

the two languages, (3) collocation pattern, and (4) frequent use of interchangeable syn-
onymous translation not covered in the dictionary These factors are the reasons why
many translations are statistically unlikely, thereby leading to a low coverage rate for
word-based methods.
Sense Gaps. Dictionary and statistically derived translations might not cover the word
sense appropriate to a given word in context. This is particularly true when using an
everyday dictionary for aligning bilingual technical manuals. For instance, the Lec-
DOCE lists four senses and relevant translations for the word click, including (1) Offi
entffiklignigial &apos;to make a slight and short sound&apos;, (2) fitli &apos;to succeed&apos;, (3) {VA
ft tit, &apos;to fall into place&apos;, (4) MRS-A- &apos;to be a quick success, esp. with members of
the opposite sex&apos;, none of which is the right sense for J &apos;to press&apos;, the translation of
click in the context of (El):
(El) Click anywhere else on the screen background or press ESC.
(Cl) /fIffil/AnIgtithltR—TRR ESC.
Mismatch in Sense Specificity. Dictionary treatment of word senses in the source lan-
guage might not correspond to the level of specificity for the relevant concepts in the
target language. For instance, the LecDOCE differentiates two word senses for the
word news by the means in which it is reported: whether it is via electronic (radio or
television) or non-electronic (newspaper) media. In Chinese, the relevant concept is
also differentiated according to how it is reported; however, the difference is between
mass media (translated as NI) and personal communication (translated as Al).
The following examples (E2, C2) and (E3, C3) demonstrate this particular instance of
mismatch in sense specificity.

Collocation Pattern. The collocation pattern often forces the choice of an ICT quite dif-
ferent from the DTs. For instance, the LecDOCE lists MN &apos;news&apos; and WIEN*. &apos;news
reportage&apos; as the translations for news. However, the translation for news modified
by bad is usually FAS &apos;message&apos;. Similarly, lady modified by old almost surely trans-
lates into tt &apos;wife&apos; rather than the DTs, tc-± &apos;lady&apos; or ktt &apos;woman&apos; given in the
LecDOCE. The following examples provide further details.

Interchangeable Synonymous Translation. Disparity might arise simply because an in-
terchangeable synonym of a DT is used. For instance, for the following LecDOCE
examples, the synonyms jam, Am, and ON are present in the translations, instead
of the respective DTs, rJtJ, AN, and ga. If these ICTs in (C7, C8, C9) are replaced
by the DTs, the subsequent translations (C7&apos;, C8&apos;, C9&apos;) remain correct.

A statistically-derived lexicon generally fares better than MRDs in covering such syn-
onymous translations. However, this is limited to synonyms that appear as an alter-
native translation frequently and consistently in a bilingual corpus.
Bounding the ICTs. An ICT may deviate from the relevant DTs for a variety of reasons,
but the deviation is not without constraints. Table 1 lists some examples of deviating
translations taken from the LecDOCE. Examples include the words news, meet, lady,
grief, care, and child and their respective translations irat , ttAgg,
and /JNIA . Notice that most in-context and dictionary translations of source words
are bounded within the same category in a typical thesaurus such as the LLOCE
(McArthur 1992) and CILIN (Mei et al. 1993). For instance, Da/9-class words in CILIN
(news and messages), MS, aria, tiM appear as the translations (DTs and ICTs) for
Ge194-words in LLOCE (information and news) such as news and report. Similarly,
1d18-class words (hitting, touching, meeting, and missing), gx, AN, gig, iNg
appear as the translations for Mc072-words (meeting people and things) such as meet
and encounter. This finding suggests that LTP can be estimated more robustly via class-
to-class mapping. Furthermore, such ICTs and DTs are often synonymous compounds

rudimentary method. Table 2 presents some examples from the experiments, indicating

To ensure broad coverage, the class-based approach seems to be a promising alter-
native to word-based methods. Classes can be formed from words in more than one
way. Automatic statistical methods for derived classes (Brown, Della Pietra, deSouza,
Lai, and Mercer 1992) are not appropriate, since they also suffer low coverage due to
data sparseness. Classes formed from morphologically related words are easy to de-
rive and apply. Morphological classes can be formed, either from words that start with
the same five-character prefix as in Gale and Church (1991b), or rigorous analysis as
suggested in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Lafferty, and Mercer (1992). Although
easily applicable, morphological classes are not particularly effective in broadening
coverage of word alignment. Chang and Chen (1994) also examine the feasibility of
using part-of-speech classes. A potential alternative involves adopting categories avail-
able in machine-readable lexicographic resources such as Roget&apos;s thesaurus (Chapman
1977) or hand-crafted computer lexicons (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, and Miller

This section describes a rudimentary word-alignment algorithm, DietAlign, based on
the DTs from a bilingual MRD such as the LecDOCE. Consider a text and translation
pair (S, T), a word s in S. and its ICT, t in T. Let DT, denote the set of translations
listed in the LecDOCE for the headword s. Recall that if for a word tin T, there is a dt
in DT, such that t matches dt completely or partially, then, t is likely to be the ICT of
s. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, DictAlign computes the set WT = ft I t is a
word in T} and calculates the similarity between each t and the DT, relevant to S. A
similarity measure based on the unweighted Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) can be given
as follows:
Based on this similarity measure, the likelihood of a connection can be associated with
the following formulation that links the likelihood of a connection to similarity with
a DT:

ClassAlign is conceived to capture the diversity of translations for broad-coverage
alignment. One way to do so is via the classification of words in thesauri. More
specifically, one can generalize from a connection (s, t) to a class-to-class mapping
(X, Y) where X and Y are thesaurus classes containing s and t respectively. However,
this simple intuition is complicated by the fact that a word might belong to more
than one class, that is, if the classification is based on a thesaurus that allows for
word-sense ambiguity. For a word in a particular context, if one considers classes that
are not intended for the context, noise can be introduced. For instance, consider the

The noise is usually distributed randomly while the signal tends to repeat itself.
Nevertheless, connections (s, t) related to some ambiguous words s or t may cause
noise to accumulate, leading to erroneous generalization. Therefore, one should try to
throw away such noise. Moreover, any signal that gets thrown away by not considering
(s, t) is often filled by a connection (s&apos;, t) where s&apos; is a synonym of s. For instance, get is
many ways ambiguous, as indicated in diversified ICTs in the LecDOCE examples in
Table 6. However, each of these ICTs seems to form a connection with a less-ambiguous
synonym of get such as receive, reach, and understand in LecDOCE examples. Table 6
provides further details.
As is typical in IR research, highly frequent and ambiguous words (known as
stopwords in the IR literature) can be thrown out to reduce such noise. A list of
stopwords used in the experiments includes the following:

With the difficulties of finding appropriate classification systems and suppress-
ing noise now resolved, the question remains: How can class-to-class mapping be
acquired? Just as with the derivation of a bilingual lexicon from a corpus, acquisition
of such mapping requires a statistical measure. The Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) is a
similarity measure that gauges the ratio of the members in one collection being iden-
tical to those of another collection. Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou (1996)
propose to link co-occurrence to the Dice coefficient in their study of bilingual collo-
cations. They observe that, unlike statistical measures related to mutual information,
the Dice coefficient is insensitive to sample size and, thus, more effective for acquiring
bilingual collocations from a bilingual corpus. Our experimental results confirm their
observation. Under a formulation linking translation to conceptual similarity, the Dice
coefficient is a very useful estimator of the class-to-class mapping.
Therefore, in this work, we measure the likelihood of class-to-class translation
mapping in terms of the ratio of member pairs that are connections observed in a
bilingual corpus. This ratio can be easily measured using the Dice coefficient as follows:

This naive estimator works efficiently for classes of compatible sizes. Occasion-
ally, for extremely small or large classes, the coefficient does not accurately reflect
how likely words in one class are to translate to words in another class. To remedy
this problem, we explore the feasibility of weighting the member words. According
to our result, weighting eradicates most instances of the problem caused by uneven
classification. The weight assigned to each word should positively correlate to the
frequency of the word so it reflects the expected ratio of word-translation pairs. As-
suming that such weights can be obtained on the basis of each word&apos;s frequency in
a bilingual corpus, weights can substitute for counts in equation (4) to arrive at the
weighted version of the Dice coefficient shown below:

3.3 Class-based Word Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999926">
The proposed alignment algorithm ClassAlign is based on the following observations:
First, dictionary translations can be used to produce high-precision connections. Thus,
DictAlign should be employed to produce initial connections whose translations ex-
hibit a high similarity to a DT. That is, a relatively high threshold, 0.7 should be used.
Second, the class-based rules acquired through the ClassRule Algorithm should cap-
ture the diversity of translations to a large extent. According to the observations in
Section 2, the rules should stipulate most of the connections left out in the DictAlign
step. Nevertheless, conflicting connections do occasionally arise. Such conflicts can be
resolved according to an additional consideration of distortion mentioned in Section 1
Estimating the Likelihood of a Connection Candidate. The above observations can be stated
formally from the perspective of Brown et al.&apos;s (1993) Model 2. As mentioned earlier,
the model stipulates that a connection be given a probability value Pr(s, t), the product
of lexical translation probability t(s I t) and distortion probability, d(i I j, 1, m). Also
according to the model, we give each connection candidate a probabilistic value based
on lexical and positional considerations:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.891936">
Pr(s, t) = t(s, t) x d(i, j) (6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996883666666667">
We argue, however, that it is difficult to robustly estimate t(s, t) and d(i, j) for all the
values of s, t, i, and j. Therefore, the two functions are defined and estimated by a
limited number of cases, according to lexical, conceptual, and positional conditions.

positional conditions are set up based on dislocation, a distortion measure relative to

Estimation of LTP Based on Lexical and Conceptual Conditions. The LTP t(s, t) is defined by
the following cases:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.781809">
Case 1. Connection (s, t) exhibits high lexical and conceptual similarity,
i.e., ConceptSim (s, t) &gt; h1 and DTSim(s, t) &gt; h2.
Case 2. Connection (s, t) exhibits high conceptual similarity i.e.,
ConceptSim (s, t) &gt; h1 and DTSim(s, t) &lt;h2.
Case 3. Connection (s, t) exhibits high lexical similarity i.e.,
ConceptSim (s, t) &lt;h1 and DTSim(s, t) &gt; h2.
Case 4. Otherwise, ConceptSim (s, t) &lt;h1 and DTSim(s, t) &lt;h2.

The connections satisfying each condition are given the same probability value
determined by maximal likelihood estimation (MLE). For instance, if there are k true
connections in a sample of n candidates (s, t) such that ConceptSim(s, t) &gt; h1 and
DTSim(s, t) &gt; h2, then all these candidates are given the same MLE value for LTP, i.e.,
t(s, t) = t1 = k/n. Equation (8) sums up the above discussion:

Estimation of Distortion Probability (DP). In a similar fashion, we formulate the distor-
tion function by cases related to the monotonicity of translational position with respect
to context. Such a formulation is inspired by Gale and Church&apos;s (1991b) treatment of
distortion. In their study, the authors replace the distortion probability with a proba-
bility function defined by different values of slope, a measure of the position of t with
respect to the left context of s. This measure is generally quite accurate, leading to
a distribution function concentrating at slope 1. Nevertheless, room for improvement
still exists, as can be illustrated using the concept of a binary inversion transduction
tree (ITT) proposed by Wu (1995). The ITT is a shared parse tree depicting the struc-
tural difference between a sentence S and its translation T. Figure 2 presents the ITT
of (E12, C12). The horizontal bar denotes that the noun phrase such a lazy mortal and
the prepositional phrase as you are inverted when translated into Mandarin. The slope
of the first word in such an inverted structure is typically quite large, making the dis-
tribution of the slope function slightly flat. If multiword structural inversion occurs,
as it frequently does, then the slope of the first word according to the right context is
still very small.

ITT of the example-translation pair (E12, C12).
For instance, the first word as in the inverted structure as you has a high slope value
with respect to its left context such a lazy mortal. However, since the words as and you
translate into the fifth and sixth words in (C12), the word as has a slope value of 1
with respect to its right context, you.
We believe that by considering the translational position relative to both the left
and right contexts, one obtains a distribution function with a smaller deviation, thereby
making a tighter estimation possible for d(i,j). To this end, we define dislocation, dis,
for the connection (s, t) of the ith and jth words in S and T to denote 1(1—i&apos;) — (i —
where i&apos; is the position of a word s&apos; sharing the minimum syntactic structure with
s, and s&apos; translates into t&apos;, the j&apos;th word in T. Short of syntactic analysis, dis(i, j) can
be calculated with respect to a nearby connection in CONN, the initial connections
established by DictAlign. Such treatment closely approximates the dislocation value.
In light of this, dislocation can be defined as follows:

(E12, C12) is represented as a cell. The connections in CONN are shown as a bold face 0. Each
of these zero dislocation values extends vertically, incrementing by one for each upward or

The connection candidates with small dislocation values tend to be true connec-

while only 1 out of 20 candidates with a dislocation of 1 is a true connection. All
candidates with dislocation values greater than 1 are false. Figure 3 provides further
details. Again, all connections satisfying a certain case in equation (10) are given the
same MLE value. For instance, if there are k true connections in a sample of n can-
didates (i,j) with 0 dislocation, then all of these candidates are given the same MLE

Algorithm 3. (ClassAlign) Class-based word alignment for a pair of sentences (S. T).
Step 1: Tag each word in S with POS information and convert each word to the
root form to obtain the set Ws of words in S.
Step 2: Initialize the result ANS to an empty list. Run DictAlign on (S, T) to obtain
a list of initial connections, CONN.
Step 3: Look up the dictionary to obtain the set WT of possible words in T.
Step 4: For each connection candidate (s, t) E Ws X WT, compute Pr(s, t) according
to equations (6) through (10).
Step 5: Add to ANS the connection (s*, t* ) that maximizes Pr(s, t) over all
s, t E Ws X WT with a value greater than h3.5 Remove all conflicting
candidates involving s* and t* from subsequent consideration. This step
repeats itself until the candidates run out or every remaining candidate

4.1 Contrastive Analysis of English and Mandarin Chinese
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953661583333333">
Language typology is the study of similarities and differences between languages,
formalized in terms of parameters such as word order and morphological structure.
Li and Thompson (1981) examine Mandarin Chinese according to four typological
parameters that reveal the basic structure of Mandarin Chinese as compared to those
of other languages, English in particular. These four parameters are the morphological
structure of words, the number of syllables per word, topic prominence, and word
order. Li and Thompson&apos;s typological description of Mandarin is described below,
from the perspective of the task of word alignment.
8 A small percentage of connections (7.8%) in our evaluation are incomplete ones and are considered to
be correct. Melamed (1996) takes the same stance in his study of deriving a probabilistic lexicon. He
observes that even incomplete entries are useful for many applications and there are ways of expanding
incomplete morphemes or words in a connection, so that they become complete (Smadja 1992).

Morphological Structure of Words. The most striking feature of Mandarin as compared to
English is the relative simplicity of word structure. That is, most Mandarin words are
comprised of a single morpheme rather than a stem morpheme and a suffix serving
grammatical functions such as case (as in Turkish and Japanese), number, agreement, or
tense (as in many other languages including English). Mandarin verbs do have aspect
morphemes, including 7 (-le, perfective), (-guo, experienced action) and (-zhe,
durative). Other grammatical functions are either non-existent or expressed through
an additional function word. In contrast to this lack of inflectional morphological
complexity, Mandarin is relatively rich in other types of morphological combinations,
including compounding.
These morphological differences result in a difference in the number of words in
an English sentence and its Mandarin translation. In terms of alignment, this word-
number difference means that multiword connections must be considered, a task which

is beyond the reach of methods proposed in recent alignment works based on Brown
et al.&apos;s (1993) Model 1 and 2.
Basic Orientation of the Sentence: Topic vs. Subject. Another feature distinguishing Man-
darin from other languages is topic prominence. In addition to the grammatical rela-
tion of subject, a description of Mandarin must include the topic element, which can
be characterized as follows: First, a topic always comes first in the sentence and is op-
tionally followed by a pause in speech. Second, a topic is the old information of which
both the speaker and listener have some knowledge. Third, what distinguishes a topic
from a subject is that the subject must always have a direct syntactic and semantic
relation with the verb, but the topic does not need to. For instance, in the sentence
(E13, C13), the first word (daxiang, &apos;elephant&apos;) is the topic and the second word
07- (bizi, &apos;nose&apos;) is the subject; t* &apos;elephant&apos; is the focus of the discourse, but it is
the subject *7- &apos;nose&apos; that is very long; not t91 &apos;elephant&apos;.
(E13) The elephant has a very long nose.
(C13) tiP. -no
Daxiang bizi hen chang
Elephant nose very long
The topic prominence of Mandarin sentences represents alignment connections
with a large distortion in position, leading to difficulty in estimating the likelihood of
a connection according to translational position.
Word Order. Greenberg (1963) stated that the world&apos;s languages fall into three word
order groups according to the order of the subject (S), verb (V), and object (0) in a
simple transitive sentence. A language, in general, belongs to one of three basic word
order types, SVO, SOV, and VSO. By this notion, English is an SVO language in which
the verb typically follows the subject and precedes the object. For most languages,
other aspects of word order, such as that of modifier and modified elements, correlate
with the order of V and 0. However, Mandarin is not an easy language to classify
according to this typology for a number of reasons. First, the notion of subject is not
well-defined. Second, unlike in English, word order in Mandarin is not determined
solely on grammatical grounds but rather depends on semantics. For instance, whether
an adverbial expression appears in pre- or postverbal position depends on subtle
semantic differences. More specifically, a time phrase in preverbal position tends to
denote punctual time, while that in postverbal position signals durative time, as in:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.741483">
(E14) I have a meeting at three o&apos;clock.
(C14) ft El. FM
I three o&apos;clock have-a-meeting

(C15&apos;) fil .5-61 IM To
I three o&apos;clock sleep ASPECT
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.964927333333333">
In contrast, both kinds of time phrase appear in postverbal position in English. As a
result of facts such as these, many linguists contend that Mandarin is a language in
transition from SVO to SOV. Further details can be found in Li and Thompson (1981).

<bodyText confidence="0.99948325">
Similar to the situation created for topic prominent sentences, the SOV features
of Mandarin represent a deviation from the SVO order of English. Such a deviation
further worsens our ability to estimate the likelihood of a connection according to
translational position.

4.2 The Experimental Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994475">
The experimental results obtained from the proposed algorithm with respect to word
alignment are presented in this section. Nearly 42,000 example sentences and their
translations from the LecDOCE were used as training data, primarily to acquire rules
and to determine MLE estimates for the cases of LTP and DP. The algorithm&apos;s per-
formance was evaluated using the two sets of data. The closed test set consists of
200 examples and their Mandarin translations randomly selected from the LecDOCE.
The English examples range from 8 to 23 words long; average example length is 11.5
words. There are, on average, 1.56 inversions per example-translation pair. The open
test set consists of 200 sentences randomly drawn from the English and Chinese ver-
sions of the LightShip User&apos;s Guide. The English sentences in this test set range from
4 to 34 words long; average sentence length is 11.8 words. There are, on average, 1.60
inversions per sentence pair. Table 16 provides some examples from the LightShip
User&apos;s Guides.
The two thesauri, LLOCE and CILIN, are used as the classification systems of
source and target words. The LLOCE contains 23,769 entries and CILIN contains 63,754
entries. Both thesauri cover just over 90% of the words in the test sets.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997215">
4.3 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986428571429">
The first three experiments were designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
naive DictAlign algorithm based on a bilingual MRD. According to the experimental
results, although DictAlign produces high-precision alignment, the coverage for both
test sets is below 30%. However, if the thesaurus effect is exploited, the coverage can
be increased considerably, at the cost of a decrease of less than 4% in precision. Table 17
provides further details.
In the fourth experiment, the ClassAlign algorithm is employed to align both sets
of test data again. Table 18 reveals that the acquired conceptual information compen-
sates for what is lacking in the LecDOCE to yield optimum alignment results. The
ClassAlign algorithm expands coverage almost twofold to over 80%, while maintain-
ing the same level of precision. The generality of the approach is evident from the
open test&apos;s comparably high coverage and precision rates. As shown in Table 18, over
80% of the source words in both test sets are connected to a target and over 90% of
the connections are true ones.

Other methods for aligning English and Mandarin texts in the literature also fall

<bodyText confidence="0.996868333333333">
Language-Specific Function Words. The morphological differences between English and
Mandarin give rise to many language-specific function words. Such Mandarin function
words are often quite ambiguous in part of speech as well as in word sense, leading to
numerous alignment errors. For instance, ClassAlign connects the words for and of in
(E20) erroneously to the morphemes 7 and Erg in (C20), respectively. Table 19 presents
further details.

<bodyText confidence="0.998308">
Collocation. As mentioned in the previous section, collocation is one of the reasons
why in-context translation usually deviates from the dictionary translation. However,
unlike other deviations, bilingual collocation is not easily bounded within a couple
of classes. For instance, the translation for take (Mb051, carrying, taking and bring) in
the collocation take effect is usually Si (&apos;see&apos;) (Fc04, seeing and looking), as in example
(E21, C21). However, there is insufficient evidence to support a class-to-class mapping
from Mb051 to Fc04. In any case, deriving the Mb051-to-Fc04 mapping would be an
overgeneralization.

<bodyText confidence="0.9994378">
Paraphrased and Free Translations. For various reasons, such as language typology, style,
and cultural differences, a translator does not always translate literally on a word-
by-word basis. Adding and deleting words is commonplace, sometimes resulting in a
paraphrased or free translation. Such translations obviously create problems for word
alignment. For instance, in example (E24, C24), only one word, I, is translated literally,
into ft . The main verb angle in example (E25) is given a paraphrased translation
&amp;Wit (&apos;to change the angle&apos;). The noun phrase the people she is speaking to in (E25)
is paraphrased as E* &apos;audience.&apos; A significant amount of free translation arises due
to the use of four-morpheme Mandarin idioms for stylistic reasons. For instance, the
clause as long as I breathe in (E22) translates into an idiom and the sentence

5.3 Class-based versus Word-based Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995129833333333">
ClassAlign achieves a degree of generality in the sense that a true connection can
be identified, even when it occurs only rarely, or not at all, in the training corpus.
This kind of generality is unattainable with statistically trained word-based models.
Moreover, class-based models offer the advantages of a smaller storage requirement
and higher system efficiency. Unfortunately, they have the disadvantage of erroneous
overgeneralization from word-specific connections. For instance, due to the acquired
mapping from Gg273 (element of sound in language) to Bg07 (sound, tone, etc.), the
verb accent in (E26) is connected erroneously to MD (&apos;syllable&apos;) in (C26).
(E26) The accent in the word &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; is on the second syllable.

Nevertheless, our experiment has shown that the advantages outweigh the disadvan-
tages, at least for this particular formulation of a class-based approach to alignment.

6. Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848090909091">
In this paper, we have presented an algorithm capable of identifying words and their
in-context translations in a bilingual corpus. The algorithm is effective for specific
linguistic reasons. First, a significant majority of words have diversified translations
that are not found in a bilingual dictionary or statistically-derived lexicon but that are
largely bounded within the word classes in thesauri. Therefore, we contend that a more
successful alignment can be achieved using a class-based approach. Our assumption
seems to hold, for the experiments in this study demonstrate that the method provides
broad-coverage alignment with almost no loss in precision.
In a broader sense, we have shown that thesauri and corpora can be used in
combination to address the critical issues of generality and efficiency. The thesaurus
provides classification that can be used to generalize the empirical knowledge gleaned

from a corpus. The corpus provides training and testing materials, thereby allowing
knowledge to be derived and evaluated objectively.
The algorithm&apos;s performance could definitely be improved by enhanci-ig the var-
ious modules of the algorithms, e.g., morphological analyses, bilingual dictionary,
monolingual thesauri, and rule acquisition. Nevertheless, this work presents a func-
tional core for processing bilingual corpora at lexical and conceptual levels.
While this paper has specifically addressed English-Chinese corpora, the linguistic
issues motivating the algorithms seem to be quite general and are, to a large extent,
language independent, which means that the algorithm presented here should be
adaptable to other language pairs. The prospects for English-Japanese or Chinese-
Japanese, in particular, seem highly promising.

<abstract confidence="0.990679142857143">This paper presents an algorithm capable of identifying the translation for each word in a bilingual corpus. Previously proposed methods rely heavily on word-based statistics. Under a word-based approach, frequent words with a consistent translation can be aligned at a high rate of precision. However, words that are less frequent or exhibit diverse translations generally do not have statistically significant evidence for confident alignment, thereby leading to incomplete or incorrect alignments. The algorithm proposed herein attempts to broaden coverage by exploiting lexicographic resources. To this end, we draw on the two classification systems of words in Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE) and Tongyici Cilin (Synonym Forest, CILIN). Automatically acquired class-based alignment rules are used to compensate for what is lacking in a bilingual dictionary such as the English-Chinese version of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LecDOCE). In addition, this alignment method is implemented using LecDOCE examples and their translations for training and testing, while further examples from a technical manual in both English and Chinese are used for an open test. Quantitative results of the closed and open tests are also summarized.</abstract>

Model 1 assumes that Pr(S I T) depends only on lexical translation probability (LTP) t(s I t), that is, the probability that the ith word s in S translates into the jth word t in T. The pair of words (s, t), or more precisely (s, t,i,j) since there could be more than one instance of s or t, is called a connection. Model 2 enhances Model 1 by considering the dependence of Pr(S I T) on the distortion probability (DP) d(i 11,1, m) where 1 and m are the respective lengths of S and T measured in number of words. Brown et al. (1990) propose using an adaptive Expectation and Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters for LTP and DP from a bilingual corpus. The EM algorithm iterates between two phases to estimate LTP and DP until both functions converge. In the expectation phase, the parameters t(s I t) and d(i Ii,!, m) in the SMT model for all possible values of s, t, j, 1, and m are estimated from the sample of an aligned bilingual corpus. In the maximization phase, each sentence-translation pair in the corpus is aligned by maximizing the translation probability, Pr(S 1 T). They examine the feasibility of ali</context>

For these applications, we must go one step further from sentence alignment and identify alignment at the word level. In the process of word alignment, the translation of each source word is identified. This study concentrates primarily on identifying alignment at the word level for a given sentence and its translation. In the context of SMT, Brown et al.

Model 1 assumes that Pr(S I T) depends only on lexical translation probability (LTP) t(s I t), that is, the probability that the ith word s in S translates into the jth word t in T.

Consider a text and translation pair (S, T), a word s in S. and its ICT, t in T. Let DT, denote the set of translations listed in the LecDOCE for the headword s. Recall that if for a word tin T, there is a dt in DT, such that t matches dt completely or partially, then, t is likely to be the ICT of s. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, DictAlign computes the set WT = ft I t is a word in T} and calculates the similarity between each t and the DT, relevant to S. A similarity measure based on the unweighted Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) can be given as follows: Based on this similarity measure, the likelihood of a connection can be associated with the following formulation that links the likelihood of a connection to similarity with a DT: DTSim(s, t) = max Sim(d, t) dEDT, For instance, consider the following sentence and its Mandarin translation, focusing on the word encounter: S = He encountered many difficulties.

Just as with the derivation of a bilingual lexicon from a corpus, acquisition of such mapping requires a statistical measure. The Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) is a similarity measure that gauges the ratio of the members in one collection being identical to those of another collection. Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou (1996) propose to link co-occurrence to the Dice coefficient in their study of bilingual collocations. They observe that, unlike statistical measures related to mutual information, the Dice coefficient is insensitive to sample size and, thus, more effective for acquiring bilingual collocations from a bilingual corpus.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we briefly discuss the nature of text and translation that justifies a class-based approach. A set of three algorithms leading to class-based alignment are outlined in Section 3. The algorithms&apos; effectiveness is demonstrated through examples and their translations in the LecDOCE (Longman Group 1992), a bilingual version of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE, Proctor 1988), as well as sentences from bilingual texts in the LightShip User&apos;s Guide (Pilot Software Inc. 1993; Galaxy Software Services 1994). The experiments we undertook to assess the performance of these algorithms are the topic of Section 4. Quantitative experimental results are also summarized. In Section 5, we analyze the experimental results and consider ways in which the proposed algorithms might be extended and improved. Concluding remarks are made in Section 6. 2. Text and Translation as a Class-to-Class Mapping The discussion in Section 1 indicates the limitations of statistical methods. As an alternative, we examine the feasibility of using an everyday bilingual dictionary in machine-readable form for word alignment. Wi</context>

Classes can be formed from words in more than one way. Automatic statistical methods for derived classes (Brown, Della Pietra, deSouza, Lai, and Mercer 1992) are not appropriate, since they also suffer low coverage due to data sparseness. Classes formed from morphologically related words are easy to derive and apply. Morphological classes can be formed, either from words that start with the same five-character prefix as in Gale and Church (1991b), or rigorous analysis as suggested in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Lafferty, and Mercer (1992). Although easily applicable, morphological classes are not particularly effective in broadening coverage of word alignment. Chang and Chen (1994) also examine the feasibility of using part-of-speech classes. A potential alternative involves adopting categories available in machine-readable lexicographic resources such as Roget&apos;s thesaurus (Chapman 1977) or hand-crafted computer lexicons (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, and Miller 1990; McRoy 1992). 3.

Word Order. Greenberg (1963) stated that the world&apos;s languages fall into three word order groups according to the order of the subject (S), verb (V), and object (0) in a simple transitive sentence. A language, in general, belongs to one of three basic word order types, SVO, SOV, and VSO. By this notion, English is an SVO language in which the verb typically follows the subject and precedes the object. For most languages, other aspects of word order, such as that of modifier and modified elements, correlate with the order of V and 0. However, Mandarin is not an easy language to classify according to this typology for a nu</context>

The similarities and differences between English and Mandarin texts are briefly reviewed, since our experiments involve the alignment of English-Mandarin parallel corpora. A general description of the materials used in the experiments follows. Finally, the success rates are quantitatively evaluated. 4.1 Contrastive Analysis of English and Mandarin Chinese Language typology is the study of similarities and differences between languages, formalized in terms of parameters such as word order and morphological structure. Li and Thompson (1981) examine Mandarin Chinese according to four typological parameters that reveal the basic structure of Mandarin Chinese as compared to those of other languages, English in particular. These four parameters are the morphological structure of words, the number of syllables per word, topic prominence, and word order. Li and Thompson&apos;s typological description of Mandarin is described below, from the perspective of the task of word alignment. 8 A small percentage of connections (7.8%) in our evaluation are incomplete ones and are considered to be correct.

More specifically, a time phrase in preverbal position tends to denote punctual time, while that in postverbal position signals durative time, as in: (E14) I have a meeting at three o&apos;clock.

As a result of facts such as these, many linguists contend that Mandarin is a language in transition from SVO to SOV. Further details can be found in Li and Thompson (1981). 335 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 Similar to the situation created for topic prominent sentences, the SOV features of Mandarin represent a deviation from the SVO order of English. Such a deviation further worsens our ability to estimate the likelihood of a connection according to translational position. 4.2 The Experimental Setup The experimental results obtained from the proposed algorithm with respect to word alignment are presented in this section.

Although easily applicable, morphological classes are not particularly effective in broadening coverage of word alignment. Chang and Chen (1994) also examine the feasibility of using part-of-speech classes. A potential alternative involves adopting categories available in machine-readable lexicographic resources such as Roget&apos;s thesaurus (Chapman 1977) or hand-crafted computer lexicons (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, and Miller 1990; McRoy 1992). 3. Algorithms Leading to Class-based Word Alignment This section describes a series of three algorithms leading to a class-based system for word alignment. The first algorithm attempts to obtain reliable connections. The second algorithm generalizes the connections into a list of class-based rules, which stipulate that a pair of classes of words in the source and target languages are likely mutual translations. The third algorithm performs the actual word alignment based on the acquired rules, in addition to DTs. 319 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 3.1 Dictionary-based Word Ali</context>

These four parameters are the morphological structure of words, the number of syllables per word, topic prominence, and word order. Li and Thompson&apos;s typological description of Mandarin is described below, from the perspective of the task of word alignment. 8 A small percentage of connections (7.8%) in our evaluation are incomplete ones and are considered to be correct. Melamed (1996) takes the same stance in his study of deriving a probabilistic lexicon.

For these applications, we must go one step further from sentence alignment and identify alignment at the word level. In the process of word alignment, the translation of each source word is identified. This study concentrates primarily on identifying alignment at the word level for a given sentence and its translation. In the context of SMT, Brown et al. (1993) present a series of five models of Pr(S I T) for word alignment. Model 1 assumes that Pr(S I T) depends only on lexical translation probability (LTP) t(s I t), that is, the probability that the ith word s in S translates into the jth word t in T. The pair of words (s, t), or more precisely (s, t,i,j) since there could be more than one instance of s or t, is called a connection. Model 2 enhances Model 1 by considering the dependence of Pr(S I T) on the distortion probability (DP) d(i 11,1, m) where 1 and m are the respective lengths of S and T measured in number of words.

In the maximization phase, each sentence-translation pair in the corpus is aligned by maximizing the translation probability, Pr(S 1 T). They examine the feasibility of aligning the English-French Hansards corpus using the SMT model, on both the sentence level and the word level. The SMT model is then tested for the task of machine translation. The model produces 35 acceptable translations for 73 sentences. However, to our knowledge, the degree of success of word alignment has not yet been explored. Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993) observe that reliably distinguishing sentence boundaries for a noisy bilingual text scanned by an OCR device is quite difficult. In such a circumstance, they recommend aligning words directly without the preprocessing phase of sentence alignment. Under that proposal, a rough character-by-character alignment is first performed. Based on the character alignment, words are subsequently aligned based on a modified version of Brown et al.&apos;s Model 2. The authors report that 60.5% of 65,000 words in a noisy document are correctly aligned. For 84% of the words, the offset from correct alignment is at</context>

Second, the class-based rules acquired through the ClassRule Algorithm should capture the diversity of translations to a large extent. According to the observations in Section 2, the rules should stipulate most of the connections left out in the DictAlign step. Nevertheless, conflicting connections do occasionally arise. Such conflicts can be resolved according to an additional consideration of distortion mentioned in Section 1 Estimating the Likelihood of a Connection Candidate. The above observations can be stated formally from the perspective of Brown et al.&apos;s (1993) Model 2. As mentioned earlier, the model stipulates that a connection be given a probability value Pr(s, t), the product of lexical translation probability t(s I t) and distortion probability, d(i I j, 1, m). Also according to the model, we give each connection candidate a probabilistic value based on lexical and positional considerations: Pr(s, t) = t(s, t) x d(i, j) (6) We argue, however, that it is difficult to robustly estimate t(s, t) and d(i, j) for all the values of s, t, i, and j. Therefore, the two functions are defined and estimated by a limited number of cases, according to lexical</context>

In contrast to this lack of inflectional morphological complexity, Mandarin is relatively rich in other types of morphological combinations, including compounding. These morphological differences result in a difference in the number of words in an English sentence and its Mandarin translation. In terms of alignment, this wordnumber difference means that multiword connections must be considered, a task which 334 Sue J. Ker and Jason S.

Another feature distinguishing Mandarin from other languages is topic prominence. In addition to the grammatical relation of subject, a description of Mandarin must include the topic element, which can be characterized as follows: First, a topic always comes first in the sentence and is optionally followed by a pause in speech. Second, a topic is the old information of which both the speaker and listener have some knowledge.

For MT and other purposes, many methods have been proposed for sentence alignment of the Hansards, an English-French corpus of Canadian parliamentary debates (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Simard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993; Gale and Church 1993), and for other language pairs, including English-German, EnglishChinese, and English-Japanese (Kay and Roscheisen 1993; Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung, Helfman, and Satish 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Wu 1994). Alignment at other levels of resolution is obviously useful. A section, paragraph, sentence, phrase, collocation, or word can be aligned to its translation (Kupiec 1993; Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou 1996). Other logical approaches involve aligning parse trees of a sentence and its translation (Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993; Meyers, Yangarber, and Grishman 1996), or simultaneously generating parse trees and alignment arrangements (Wu 1995). * Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, 30043, Taiwan, ROC.

Such a formulation is inspired by Gale and Church&apos;s (1991b) treatment of distortion. In their study, the authors replace the distortion probability with a probability function defined by different values of slope, a measure of the position of t with respect to the left context of s. This measure is generally quite accurate, leading to a distribution function concentrating at slope 1. Nevertheless, room for improvement still exists, as can be illustrated using the concept of a binary inversion transduction tree (ITT) proposed by Wu (1995). The ITT is a shared parse tree depicting the structural difference between a sentence S and its translation T. Figure 2 presents the ITT of (E12, C12). The horizontal bar denotes that the noun phrase such a lazy mortal and the prepositional phrase as you are inverted when translated into Mandarin. The slope of the first word in such an inverted structure is typically quite large, making the distribution of the slope function slightly flat. If multiword structural inversion occurs, as it frequently does, then the slope of the first word according to the right context is still very small. (E12</context>

For these applications, we must go one step further from sentence alignment and identify alignment at the word level. In the process of word alignment, the translation of each source word is identified. This study concentrates primarily on identifying alignment at the word level for a given sentence and its translation. In the context of SMT, Brown et al. (1993) present a series of five models of Pr(S I T) for word alignment. Model 1 assumes that Pr(S I T) depends only on lexical translation pr</context>
