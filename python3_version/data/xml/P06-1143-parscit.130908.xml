<bodyText confidence="0.9998814">
Machine Transliteration is to transcribe a
word written in a script with approximate
phonetic equivalence in another lan-
guage. It is useful for machine transla-
tion, cross-lingual information retrieval,
multilingual text and speech processing.
Punjabi Machine Transliteration (PMT)
is a special case of machine translitera-
tion and is a process of converting a word
from Shahmukhi (based on Arabic script)
to Gurmukhi (derivation of Landa,
Shardha and Takri, old scripts of Indian
subcontinent), two scripts of Punjabi, ir-
respective of the type of word.
The Punjabi Machine Transliteration
System uses transliteration rules (charac-
ter mappings and dependency rules) for
transliteration of Shahmukhi words into
Gurmukhi. The PMT system can translit-
erate every word written in Shahmukhi.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.989968565217392">
Punjabi is the mother tongue of more than 110
million people of Pakistan (66 million), India (44
million) and many millions in America, Canada
and Europe. It has been written in two mutually
incomprehensible scripts Shahmukhi and Gur-
mukhi for centuries. Punjabis from Pakistan are
unable to comprehend Punjabi written in Gur-
mukhi and Punjabis from India are unable to
comprehend Punjabi written in Shahmukhi. In
contrast, they do not have any problem to under-
stand the verbal expression of each other. Pun-
jabi Machine Transliteration (PMT) system is an
effort to bridge the written communication gap
between the two scripts for the benefit of the mil-
lions of Punjabis around the globe.
Transliteration refers to phonetic translation
across two languages with different writing sys-
tems (Knight &amp; Graehl, 1998), such as Arabic to
English (Nasreen &amp; Leah, 2003). Most prior
work has been done for Machine Translation
(MT) (Knight &amp; Leah, 97; Paola &amp; Sanjeev,
2003; Knight &amp; Stall, 1998) from English to
other major languages of the world like Arabic,
Chinese, etc. for cross-lingual information re-
trieval (Pirkola et al, 2003), for the development
of multilingual resources (Yan et al, 2003; Kang
&amp; Kim, 2000) and for the development of cross-
lingual applications.
PMT is a special kind of machine translitera-
tion. It converts a Shahmukhi word into a Gur-
mukhi word irrespective of the type constraints
of the word. It not only preserves the phonetics
of the transliterated word but in contrast to usual
transliteration, also preserves the meaning.
Two scripts are discussed and compared.
Based on this comparison and analysis, character
mappings between Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi are
drawn and transliteration rules are discussed.
Finally, architecture and process of the PMT sys-
tem are discussed. When it is applied to Punjabi
Unicode encoded text especially designed for
testing, the results were complied and analyzed.
PMT system will provide basis for Cross-
Scriptural Information Retrieval (CSIR) and
Cross-Scriptural Application Development
(CSAD).

According to Paola (2003), “When writing a for-
eign name in one’s native language, one tries to
preserve the way it sounds, i.e. one uses an or-
thographic representation which, when read
aloud by the native speaker of the language,
sounds as it would when spoken by a speaker of
the foreign language – a process referred to as
Transliteration”. Usually, transliteration is re-
ferred to phonetic translation of a word of some

specific type (proper nouns, technical terms, etc)
across languages with different writing systems.
Native speakers may not understand the meaning
of transliterated word.
PMT is a special type of Machine Translitera-
tion in which a word is transliterated across two
different writing systems used for the same lan-
guage. It is independent of the type constraint of
the word. It preserves both the phonetics as well
as the meaning of transliterated word.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996448">
3.1 Shahmukhi
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976658923076923">
Shahmukhi derives its character set form the
Arabic alphabet. It is a right-to-left script and the
shape assumed by a character in a word is con-
text sensitive, i.e. the shape of a character is dif-
ferent depending whether the position of the
character is at the beginning, in the middle or at
the end of the word. Normally, it is written in
Nastalique, a highly complex writing system that
is cursive and context-sensitive. A sentence illus-
trating Shahmukhi is given below:
X}Z Ìáââ y6– ÌÐâ&lt; ڻ6– ~@ԧð ÌÌ6=ҊP
It has 49 consonants, 16 diacritical marks and
16 vowels, etc. (Malik 2005)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997424">
3.2 Gurmukhi
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955107">
Gurmukhi derives its character set from old
scripts of the Indian Sub-continent i.e. Landa
(script of North West), Sharda (script of Kash-
mir) and Takri (script of western Himalaya). It is
a left-to-right syllabic script. A sentence illustrat-
ing Gurmukhi is given below:
ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਮੇਰੀ ਮਾਣ ਜੋਗੀ ਮ ਬੋਲੀ ਏ.
It has 38 consonants, 10 vowels characters, 9
vowel symbols, 2 symbols for nasal sounds and 1
symbol that duplicates the sound of a consonant.

4 Analysis and PMT Rules

<bodyText confidence="0.999770583333333">
Punjabi is written in two completely different
scripts. One script is right-to-left and the other is
left-to-right. One is Arabic based cursive and the
other is syllabic. But both of them represent the
phonetic repository of Punjabi. These phonetic
sounds are used to determine the relation be-
tween the characters of two scripts. On the basis
of this idea, character mappings are determined.
For the analysis and comparison, both scripts
are subdivided into different group on the basis
of types of characters e.g. consonants, vowels,
diacritical marks, etc.

4.1 Consonant Mapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994704043478261">
Consonants can be further subdivided into two
groups:
Aspirated Consonants: There are sixteen as-
pirated consonants in Punjabi (Malik, 2005). Ten
of these aspirated consonants (JJ[bʰ], JJ[pʰ],
JJ[ṱʰ], JJ[ʈʰ], bY[ʤʰ], bb[ʧʰ], |e[ḓʰ], |e[ɖʰ], ÏÏ[kʰ],
ÏÏ[gʰ]) are very frequently used in Punjabi as
compared to the remaining six aspirates (|g[rʰ],
|h[ɽʰ], Ïà[lʰ], Jb[mʰ], JJ[nʰ], |z[vʰ]). In
Shahmukhi, aspirated consonants are represented
by the combination of a consonant (to be aspi-
rated) and HEH-DOACHASHMEE (|). For
example [ [b] +  |[h] = JJ [bʰ] and ` [ʤ] +  |[h]
= bY [ʤʰ] .
In Gurmukhi, each frequently used aspirated-
consonant is represented by a unique character.
But, less frequent aspirated consonants are repre-
sented by the combination of a consonant (to be
aspirated) and sub-joined PAIREEN HAAHAA
e.g. ਲ [l] + ◌੍ + ਹ [h] = ਲ (Ïà) [lʰ] and ਵ [v] + ◌੍
+ ਹ [h] = ਵ (|z) [vʰ], where ◌੍ is the sub-joiner.
The sub-joiner character (◌੍) tells that the follow-
ing ਹ [h] is going to change the shape of

Non-Aspirated Consonants: In case of non-

symbol for one sound principle. On the other
hand there are more then one characters for a
single sound in Shahmukhi. For example, Seh

mukhi. Non-aspirated consonants mapping is

4.2 Vowel Mapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995854034482759">
Punjabi contains ten vowels. In Shahmukhi,
these vowels are represented with help of four
long vowels (Alef Madda (W), Alef (Z), Vav (z) and
Choti Yeh (~)) and three short vowels (Arabic
Fatha – Zabar (F:%), Arabic Damma – Pesh (E:%)
and Arabic Kasra – Zer (G:%)). Note that the last
two long vowels are also used as consonants.
Hamza (p) is a special character and always
comes between two vowel sounds as a place
holder. For example, in õG›66W [ɑsɑɪʃ] (comfort),
Hamza (p) is separating two vowel sounds Alef (Z)
and Zer (G:%), in rW [ɑo] (come), Hamza (p) is
separating two vowel sounds Alef Madda (W) [ɑ]
and Vav (z) [o], etc. In the first example õG›66W
[ɑsɑɪʃ] (comfort), Hamza (p) is separating two
vowel sounds Alef (Z) and Zer (G:%), but normally
Zer (G:%) is dropped by common people. So
Hamza (p) is mapped on ਇ [ɪ] when it is followed
by a consonant.
In Gurmukhi, vowels are represented by ten
independent vowel characters (ਅ, ਆ, ਇ, ਈ, ਉ,
ਊ, ਏ, ਐ, ਓ, ਔ) and nine dependent vowel signs
(◌ਾ, ਿ◌, ◌ੀ, ◌ੁ, ◌ੂ, ◌ੇ, ◌ੈ, ◌ੋ, ◌ੌ). When a vowel
sound comes at the start of a word or is inde-
pendent of some consonant in the middle or end
of a word, independent vowels are used; other-
wise dependent vowel signs are used. The analy-
sis of vowels is shown in Table 4 and the vowel
mapping is given in Table 3.

Both in Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi, diacritical
marks (dependent vowel signs in Gurmukhi) are
the back bone of the vowel system and are very
important for the correct pronunciation and un-
derstanding the meaning of a word. There are
sixteen diacritical marks in Shahmukhi and nine
dependent vowel sings in Gurmukhi (Malik,
2005). The mapping of diacritical marks is given

Diacritical marks in Shahmukhi are very im-
portant for the correct pronunciation and under-
standing the meaning of a word. But they are
sparingly used in writing by common people. In
the normal text of Shahmukhi books, newspa-
pers, and magazines etc. one will not find the
diacritical marks. The pronunciation of a word
and its meaning would be comprehended with
the help of the context in which it is used.
For example,
In the first sentence, the word ~hâa is pronounced
as [tf ori] and it conveys the meaning of ‘wide’.
In the second sentence, the word ~hâa is pro-
nounced as [tfuri] and it conveys the meaning of
‘bangle’. There should be Zabar (F◌) after Cheh
(a) and Pesh (E◌) after Cheh (a) in the first and
second words respectively, to remove the ambi-
guities.
It is clear from the above example that dia-
critical marks are essential for removing ambi-
guities, natural language processing and speech
synthesis.

The basic idea behind these rules is the same as
that of the character mappings. These rules in-
clude rules for aspirated consonants, non-
aspirated consonants, Alef (Z), Alef Madda (W),
Vav (z), Choti Yeh (~) etc. Only some of these
rules are discussed here due to space limitations.

Gurmukhi consonants e.g. J → A [s]. Any dia-
critical mark except Shadda (&apos;:1) is ignored at this
point and is treated in rules for vowels or in rules
for diacritical marks. In Shahmukhi, Shadda (`-)
is placed after the consonant but in Gurmukhi, its
equivalent Addak (::�) is placed before the con-
sonant e.g. r + �◌ → ::�� [pp]. Both Shadda (&apos;:1)
and Addak (::�) double the sound a consonant
after or before which they are placed.
This rule is applicable to all consonants in Ta-
ble 1 and 2 except Ain (t,), Noon (cj),
Noonghunna (L)), Vav (i), Heh Gol (e),
Dochashmee Heh (m), Choti Yeh (J) and Baree
Yeh (�). These characters are treated separately.
Rule for Hamza (p): Hamza (p) is a special
character of Shahmukhi. Rules for Hamza (p) are:
− If Hamza (p) is followed by Choti Yeh (J), then
Hamza (p) and Choti Yeh (J) will be
transliterated into t [i].
− If Hamza (p) is followed by Baree Yeh (�),
then Hamza (p) and Baree Yeh (�) will be
transliterated into t [e].
− If Hamza (p) is followed by Zer (�◌), then
Hamza (p) and Zer (�◌) will be transliterated
into fg [ɪ].
− If Hamza (p) is followed by Pesh (�◌), then
Hamza (p) and Pesh (�◌) will be transliterated
into f� [ʊ].
In all other cases, Hamza (p) will be transliter-
ated into fg [ɪ].

The architecture of PMT system and its func-

architecture of Punjabi Machine Transliteration
System is shown in figure 1.
Unicode encoded Shahmukhi text input is re-
ceived by the Input Text Parser that
parses it into Shahmukhi words by using simple
parsing techniques. These words are called
Shahmukhi Tokens. Then these tokens are given
to the Transliteration Component. This
component gives each token to the PMT Token
Converter that converts a Shahmukhi Token
into a Gurmukhi Token by using the PMT
Rules Manager, which consists of character
mappings and dependency rules. The PMT To-

<bodyText confidence="0.999631076923077">
The PMT Process is implemented in the PMT
Token Converter and the PMT Rules
Manager. For PMT, each Shahmukhi Token is
parsed into its constituent characters and the
character dependencies are determined on the
basis of the occurrence and the contextual
placement of the character in the token. In each
Shahmukhi Token, there are some characters that
bear dependencies and some characters are inde-
pendent of such contextual dependencies for
transliteration. If the character under considera-
tion bears a dependency, then it is resolved and
transliterated with the help of dependency rules.

If the character under consideration does not bear
a dependency, then its transliteration is achieved
by character mapping. This is done through map-
ping a character of the Shahmukhi token to its
equivalent Gurmukhi character with the help of
character mapping tables 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7, which-
ever is applicable. In this way, a Shahmukhi To-
ken is transliterated into its equivalent Gurmukhi
Token.
Consider some input Shahmukhi text S. First it
is parsed into Shahmukhi Tokens (S1, S2... SN).
th
Suppose that Si = “y63„Zz” [valeja�] is the iShah-
mukhi Token. S i is parsed into characters Vav (z)
[v], Alef (Z) [ɑ], Lam (w) [l], Choti Yeh (~) [j],
Alef (Z) [ɑ] and Noon Ghunna (y) [13]. Then PMT
mappings and dependency rules are applied to
transliterate the Shahmukhi Token into a Gur-
mukhi Token. The Gurmukhi Token
G=“ਵਾਿਲਆਂ” is generated from Si. The step by
i
step process is clearly shown in Table 8.

In this way, all Shahmukhi Tokens are trans-
literated into Gurmukhi Tokens (G1, G2 ... Gn).
From these Gurmukhi Tokens, Gurmukhi text G
is generated.
The important point to be noted here is that
input Shahmukhi text must contain all necessary
diacritical marks, which are necessary for the
correct pronunciation and understanding the
meaning of the transliterated word.

6.1 Input Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985733333334">
The first task for evaluation of the PMT system
is the selection of input texts. To consider the
historical aspects, two manuscripts, poetry by
Maqbal (Maqbal) and Heer by Waris Shah
(Waris, 1766) were selected. Geographically
Punjab is divided into four parts eastern Punjab
(Indian Punjab), central Punjab, southern Punjab
and northern Punjab. All these geographical re-
gions represent the major dialects of Punjabi.
Hayms of Baba Nanak (eastern Punjab), Heer by
Waris Shah (central Punjab), Hayms by Khawaja
Farid (southern Punjab) and Saif-ul-Malooq by
Mian Muhammad Bakhsh (northern Punjab)
were selected for the evaluation of PMT system.
All the above selected texts are categorized as
classical literature of Punjabi. In modern litera-
ture, poetry and short stories of different poets
and writers were selected from some issues of
Puncham (monthly Punjabi magazine since
1985) and other published books. All of these
selected texts were then compiled into Unicode
encoded text as none of them were available in
this form before.
The main task after the compilation of all the
selected texts into Unicode encoded texts is to
put all necessary diacritical marks in the text.
This is done with help of dictionaries. The accu-
racy of the PMT system depends upon the neces-
sary diacritical marks. Absence of the necessary
diacritical marks affects the accuracy greatly.

<bodyText confidence="0.99509825">
After the compilation of selected input texts, they
are transliterated into Gurmukhi texts by using
the PMT system. Then the transliterated Gur-
mukhi texts are tested for errors and accuracy.
Testing is done manually with help of dictionar-
ies of Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi by persons who
know both scripts. The results are given in Table
9.

If we look at the results, it is clear that the
PMT system gives more than 98% accuracy on
classical literature and more than 99% accuracy
on the modern literature. So PMT system fulfills
the requirement of transliteration across two
scripts of Punjabi. The only constraint to achieve
this accuracy is that input text must contain all
necessary diacritical marks for removing ambi-
guities.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999645">
Shahmukhi and Gurmukhi being the only two
prevailing scripts for Punjabi expressions en-
compass a population of almost 110 million
around the globe. PMT is an endeavor to bridge
the ethnical, cultural and geographical divisions
between the Punjabi speaking communities. By
implementing this system of transliteration, new
horizons for thought, idea and belief will be
shared and the world will gain an impetus on the
efforts harmonizing relationships between na-
tions. The large repository of historical, literary
and religious work done by generations will now
be available for easy transformation and critique
for all. The research has future milestone ena-
bling PMT system for back machine translitera-
tion from Gurmukhi to Shahmukhi.

It is useful for machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, multilingual text and speech processing. Punjabi Machine Transliteration (PMT) is a special case of machine transliteration and is a process of converting a word from Shahmukhi (based on Arabic script) to Gurmukhi (derivation of Landa, Shardha and Takri, old scripts of Indian subcontinent), two scripts of Punjabi, irrespective of the type of word. The Punjabi Machine Transliteration System uses transliteration rules (character mappings and dependency rules) for transliteration of Shahmukhi words into Gurmukhi.

For the analysis and comparison, both scripts are subdivided into different group on the basis of types of characters e.g. consonants, vowels, diacritical marks, etc. 4.1 Consonant Mapping Consonants can be further subdivided into two groups: Aspirated Consonants: There are sixteen aspirated consonants in Punjabi (Malik, 2005). Ten of these aspirated consonants (JJ[bʰ], JJ[pʰ], JJ[ṱʰ], JJ[ʈʰ], bY[ʤʰ], bb[ʧʰ], |e[ḓʰ], |e[ɖʰ], ÏÏ[kʰ], ÏÏ[gʰ]) are very frequently used in Punjabi as compared to the remaining six aspirates (|g[rʰ], |h[ɽʰ], Ïà[lʰ], Jb[mʰ], JJ[nʰ], |z[vʰ]). In Shahmukhi, aspirated consonants are represented by the combination of a consonant (to be aspirated) and HEH-DOACHASHMEE (|). For example [ [b] + |[h] = JJ [bʰ] and ` [ʤ] + |[h] = bY [ʤʰ] .
