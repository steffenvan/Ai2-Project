<bodyText confidence="0.999931380952381">
A long-standing debate in the computational linguistic community is about the gen-
erality of lexical taxonomies. Many linguists (Nirenburg 1995; Hirst 1995) stress that
taxonomies that are not language neutral, at least at the intermediate and high level,
have little hope of success. On the other hand, lexicon builders who have experience
of designing taxonomies for real applications claim that in sublanguages there exist
very domain-dependent similarity relations. Given our experience and results, we are
inclined to take the second position, but we are indeed sensitive to the theoretical
motivations of the first.
The problem is that the similarity relations suggested by the thematic structures of
words in sentences are highly domain dependent, and it is difficult, though perhaps
not impossible, to find common invariants across sublanguages when this model of
word similarity is adopted. On the other hand, conceptual, or compositional models
of similarity are much more difficult to understand and formalize on a systematic
basis, because of the difficulty of defining a commonly agreed upon set of semantic
primitives into which words may be decomposed.
It may be possible, however, and highly interesting, to integrate the results of a
purely inductive method, such as the conceptual clustering system CIAULA (Basili,
Pazienza, and Velardi 1993c, 1996a), and a hand-encoded, domain-general classifica-
tion, such as, for example, WordNet. The purpose of one such experiment, which
we describe in this paper, is to find some points of contact between psychologically
motivated models, as WordNet, and data-driven models, as CIAULA.2

2. Detecting Verb Similarities with a Sublanguage

To analyze verb similarities, we used CIAULA, a conceptual clustering algorithm for
word classification, which we applied to the task of verb categorization. We will not
provide details of the specific algorithm used (they may be found in works referred
to above), we will simply summarize the main features of the system.

CIAULA is an unsupervised learning algorithm for incremental concept formation,
based on an augmented version of the well-known COBWEB (Fisher 1987).
The input observations (instances) for our concept-formation algorithm are verb
observations in sentences, represented by their generalized thematic structures, ac-
quired semiautomatically from corpora by ARIOSTO_LEX (Basili, Pazienza, and Ve-
lardi 1993a, 1993b, 1996b).
In CIAULA, the thematic roles of a verb v in a sentence are represented by a
feature-vector:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989304">
v/ (R1 : Cat,) it E I,jt eJ t = 1, 2, ... , n (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991968142857143">
In (1), RI, are the conceptual relations, or thematic roles (agentive, instrument, etc.)
and Cat, are the conceptual types of the words to which v is related semantically.
Conceptual relations are assigned semiautomatically. Conceptual types are assigned
either manually (in Italian, since no on-line resources are available) or automatically,
using WordNet.
For example, the following sentence in an English remote sensing domain (here-
after RSD):

Semantic similarity is strongly suggested by the observation of verb configurations,
in which words of the same conceptual type play the same roles.

basic-level categories (Rosch 1978) for an acquired hierarchy of verbs,
i.e., those bringing the most predictive information about their members.
The results of repeated experiments showed that CIAULA is able, upon an appro-
priate setting of the model parameters, to detect similarity relations in the thematic
structure of verbs, and to provide a probabilistic and semantic description of the ac-
quired clusters. We observed that, by tuning the model parameters to obtain clusters
of &amp;quot;very similar&amp;quot; instances, a percentage varying between 30% and 60% of verbs (de-
pending upon the number of input observations) belong to singletons, that is, are not
&amp;quot;similar enough&amp;quot; to any other verb. If we relax these constraints, we obtain larger
clusters and fewer singletons, but verbs in a cluster are less semantically close to each
other.
In Figure 1 we show two basic-level categories obtained with different values of
the model parameters, for the RSD. For each cluster member, the local and global
membership is shown. Members of Class 1,870 are verbs that take an abstraction (ABS)
as a direct object. Class 1,603 was generated in a different run, in which we imposed
a tighter similarity among the cluster members. The verbs in this category take with

The similarity relations detected by CIAULA cannot be used tout court as a tax-
onomy in a NLP system. However, they can be used to tune a general-purpose taxon-
omy to a specific domain, by reducing sense ambiguity and identifying new, domain-
specific senses. For example, the predicted thematic structure for the cluster 1,603
shows that the verb to deal has a more specific use than in general language. In the

Cross-linguistic experiments (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1996b) showed that sim-
ilarity relations are different in different domains, which raises the issue of detecting
language invariants, that is, a language-neutral ontology (at least at the highest levels).
Our contribution to this long-standing issue will be empirical, rather than methodolog-
ical.

3. Analysing the Relations between Corpus-induced and
Human-deduced Categories
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999223777777778">
In this section, we propose a method to analyze the relations between a domain-general
ontology, such as WordNet, derived by linguists seeking language-neutral principles,
and our example-driven clusters, derived by CIAULA. The purpose of this analysis
is not to validate CIAULA with WordNet, nor to augment WordNet with CIAULA.
Rather, our purpose is to identify commonalities and discrepancies, and to investigate
the possibility of profitably integrating the two approaches.
One of the motivations for using WordNet is that, in WordNet, verb meaning is
represented in terms of semantic relations, rather than semantic primitives (Miller and
Fellbaum 1991). Hence, in principle, WordNet and CIAULA adopt the same relational

Let C be a cluster automatically derived by CIAULA (Basili et al. 1996a). A cluster
is simply a set of verbs modeled by means of a graded membership function,
i.e., the local membership of verbs, it(v, C) (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1993c).
Let S(v) be the set of senses of the verb v.
For each sense s in S(v), the set of WordNet hyperonims of s is defined. Let
syns(v) denote this set, i.e.,

The is_a relation denote the transitive closure of WordNet ISA: syns(v) is the set
of possible (ambiguous) WordNet hyperonims of the verb v, through its senses

Let syns(C) denote the set of all hyperonims of at least one verb v in C, i.e.,

The preference score g is a real-valued function defined by:

The best Wordnet label syns for the cluster C is the one that maximizes g.

approach to describe verbs and detect similarities. To investigate the commonalities
between CIAULA and WordNet we decided to automatically select the best WordNet
concept as a label to assign to each acquired CIAULA cluster.
Let v, be the members of a CIAULA basic-level cluster C, S(v,) the synsets for each
v, and h(S(v,)), or h,, the set of supertypes (hyperonims) of S(v,). If gr(h,) is the number
of incoming IS_A arcs for a supertype, that is the number of synsets of v, that point
to h1, an intuitive algorithm would be to select as the best supertype for a cluster the
one that maximizes gr(h1) values.
Things, however, are more complex. First, we must apply some normalization in
order to reduce the noise caused by the more ambiguous verbs. Second, we must
balance the effect of verbs that have more than one synset pointing to the same hi.
In fact, a supertype could gain evidence only because several senses of the same
verb point to it. Finally, the algorithm must avoid the selection of excessively general
categories, like create, make. Figure 2 describes the algorithm more formally.
During a first experiment, we ran the tagging algorithm using unrestricted sets
of verbs first clustered by CIAULA. Because of the relatively sparse examples, the
over generality of WordNet and the over specificity of CIAULA produced limited
interactions. In some cases, CIAULA clusters received a &amp;quot;pertinent&amp;quot; WordNet sense
label, but in some cases they did not. A &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; example in a legal domain in Italian

(hereafter LD) is the class: evaluate, regulate, assign, determine, examine, resolve, maintain
that received the label: judge, form an opinion of, pass judgement on. A &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; choice in the
same domain, is the class: indicate, establish, foresee, determine that received the overly
general label: create, make. On average, we were satisfied with one-half of the tags
assigned to clusters.
This evaluation was performed by inspection, hence it is purely empirical. Given
a set of examples of verb uses, we can more or less easily tell whether a conceptual
definition in terms of thematic structures (as provided by CIAULA) is appropriate or
not. But it is much more difficult to say whether, for example, the CIAULA class mea-
sure, propose, derive, evaluate, discover, classify, describe, calculate is appropriately described
by the WordNet label communicate, transmit thoughts, transmit feelings.
In WordNet, there are limited definitions of the conceptual labels used, or hyper-
onims. In general, lists of words or phrases are used in place of a single label, so
that the reader may have an idea of what is really meant. But the higher the node, the
deeper the &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; behind a hyperonim, the harder is the human task of evaluating
the appropriateness of a classification.
Looking more in detail, the problem with misclassifications is twofold. In some
cases, the problem is the overambiguity and the very fine-grained concept labels
adopted in WordNet. Especially with large CIAULA clusters, the number of synsets
becomes too large, and the algorithm does not gain enough evidence of any sig-
nificantly promising pattern in the hierarchy. The second problem is the overspeci-
ficity of CIAULA. For example, verbs in the second cluster of the previous exam-
ple (i.e., the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; choice), have been clustered because they occurred in patterns
like: the law/DOCUMENT indicates (establish, determine. . . ) the deadline/TEmpoRAL_ENTITy for the
presentation. . . . It is unlikely that the linguists who developed WordNet had in mind
such a narrow use of these verbs when classifying them.
WordNet labels for CIAULA classes are somewhat overly general. Different
CIAULA clusters received the same WordNet label, and this was used as a hint to
further structure the induced classification. An example is shown in Figure 3. The
resulting taxonomy is built under a default node.
In a second set of experiments, we ran CIAULA on a more homogeneous set of
verbs. Rather than inducing verb categories from scratch, we augmented the seman-
tic bias of CIAULA by preclassifying all the verbs in the RSD using the 15 WordNet
semantic domains for verbs, which are: bodily care, change, cognition, communication,

competition, consumption, contact, creation, emotion, motion, perception, possession, social in-
teraction, stative, and weather. We then fed CIAULA with groups of verbs belonging to
each of these categories. Of course, many of these verbs are ambiguous, but we used
a probabilistic method (Basili et al. 1995) to select the observations of each verb that
are genuine examples of a semantic domain.
This experiment produced rather appropriate classifications. Table 1 shows the
labels assigned to some basic-level clusters generated by CIAULA for the RSD verbs
belonging to the semantic category cognition. Figure 4 shows an excerpt of the CIAULA
clusters of Table 1, with the prototypical description of each cluster.
In Table 1 the fourth column (Overlap Score) is the ratio between verbs in a cluster
(column 1) that belong to the WordNet synset of column 3, and the cardinality of the
cluster. In fact the best synset for a cluster does not necessarily cover all the cluster
members. In the full experiment, 67% of the clusters have a score &gt; 0.5, indicating a
good overlap between CIAULA and WordNet. Worst clusters, as far as the overlap
score is concerned, are those in which there are very high-level and ambiguous verbs,
like make. These verbs usually produce noise, because of WordNet ambiguity and of
the spurious (for the category) input examples fed to CIAULA.
There are instead clusters with a low overlap score that seem very appropriate if
one looks at the usage patterns in the corpus. For examples, the verbs of cluster 2,725
in Table 1 are highly characterized (i.e., have high local membership values) by the fact
that they take as object some physical PROPERTY (PR) of a NATURAL_OBJECT. If we
consider the prototypical descriptions of clusters globally, we observe recurrent pat-
terns of use of the clustered verbs. Verbs of cognition in the RSD are strongly character-
ized by a MENTAL OBJECT (MO), or COGNITIVE_PROCESS (CO), or ABSTRACTION
(ABS), in the position of direct object (AFFECTED). Frequently, the object of a cognition
verb is a physical PROPERTY or a NATURAL_OBJECT, and the analysis is performed
with some INSTRUMENTALITY (INS) (... cloud parameters are derived from satellite. . .).
In order to analyze the correspondence/divergence between human-coded verb
classes and data-driven clusters we can compare the argument structure proposed
for the synsets in WordNet and the intentional description of the classes, i.e., the
prototypical semantic patterns of CIAULA clusters (Figure 4).
The WordNet argument structure for verbs, however, simply provides a qualitative
description of the possible phrasal patterns in which verbs in a given synset can be
used. For example the sense record, enter, put down, make a record of of the verb to record
(line 1 in Table 1), is described by
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.876508">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.941282857142857">

As shown, the information available is mainly syntactic, with the exception of the
ANIMATE/INANIMATE distinction for the arguments.
The classification of CIAULA assigns the verb to record to four classes: (1) record,
enter, put down, make a record of, (2) decide, make up one&apos;s mind, decide upon, determine,
(3) create, make, and (4) investigate, look into, as shown in Table 1. The different classes
are characterized by the following semantic patterns, as shown in Figure 4:

• Some relations are not predicted by WordNet, as for example pattern
(iii). Locative relations are treated in WordNet as lexical adjuncts of the
verb to record. However, they seem very relevant in the sublanguage (as
for example in sentences like: ... pollutants are recorded and analyzed in
surface waters, temperature is recorded (collected) in the bay area . . .). It seems
that (some) lexical adjuncts may play an important role in the definition
of domain-specific senses of verbs.

It appears that much information relevant for the lexical encoding of verbs is do-
main specific and is completely missing in a general-purpose classification like Word-
Net. Therefore, semantically driven NL interpreters may profitably be augmented with
the information obtained by merging these different sources.
A further interesting issue is related to identical tags assigned to different clus-
ters. Verbs in these classes should express similar acts or events. An analysis of the
prototypical patterns that CIAULA assigns to these classes suggests that despite the
shared WordNet tags, verbs in these classes are very different.
For example, the classes 2,383, 2,055, 3,518, 2,102, 914 are all labeled create, make,
a very general synset in WordNet. Their patterns are very different, and show almost
no overlap. The main motivation for this divergence between WordNet tagging and
the meanings of CIAULA clusters is twofold. On the one hand, CIAULA clusters are
very fine grained, as they are built from single observations of verb uses. On the other
hand, WordNet is often missing most of these precise (technical) uses of verbs. As
a result, the labeling algorithm of Figure 2 is forced to generalize over many levels,
with a consequent loss of information. The argument structure of the reached synset
is thus too generic. It is worth noticing that even in these cases, we still achieve
useful information, since the WordNet argument structure can be further specified by
domain-specific semantic constraints. The class 2,055, for example, may be described
by an extended argument structure like
(4) {Somebody, Something} makes {X},
where X is an ABSTRACTION

<bodyText confidence="0.999985333333333">
The results illustrated in this paper are very interesting, though not conclusive. Verbs
are vessels for human creativity in language communication, and so much is left to
further studies. We discovered thematic features that are apparently more &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; than
others, with respect to a given semantic domain (cognition) and a given sublanguage
(RSD). We could specify features that were described at a very general level in Word-
Net, and detect semantic restrictions specific to the sublanguage, not accounted for in
WordNet. These results suggest that, with appropriate customization, it is still possible
to exploit the information in general-purpose on-line thesauri that would be otherwise
almost unusable in real NLP applications. As proposed in this paper, an appropriate
process of lexical tuning can significantly reduce the overgenerality (excessive am-
biguity) and underspecificity (weak constraints on verb argument structures) that is
typical of general-purpose resources.
