Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921133333333">
The natural language spoken dialogue
system AGORA (TID&apos;s advanced system
of services development) has been
developed using a Collaborative Dialogue
model with Mixed Initiative and
Computational Linguistic models and
experiences. Thanks to these
technologies, the system is highly flexible
and it doesn&apos;t need keywords or directed
menus. In this demo you will see the
multilingual ability and the proacti-vity
possibilities of the system. You will also
observe a multiservice system and a vocal
platform with the last advances in data
collection of expert subdialogues.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998029555555556">
The most important feature of any modem
speech-system is the vast amount of information
that must manage. The exponential growth of this
amount of information has introduced new
complexity to these systems.
We have developed a Customer
Communication Speech System, AGORA, based
on a natural spoken dialogue with four basic
pillars:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993777571428571">
• Proactivity.
• Recuperation and Management of
dialogue mistakes.
• Learning Skill to structure and store di-
fferent kinds of knowledge.
• Reusing Ability of expert subdialogue
modules.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893870967742">
This technology enables people to
communicate and obtain information in an
intuitive way without the necessity of guided
menus that request the user to know keywords or
special terminology. The system is Collaborative
with free interaction and not guided. Users can
ask any question to the system, when and how
they want to, using their own everyday words
and phrases, just as if they were talking to
another person.
AGORA it&apos;s been used successfully in a
wide range of information services in which
customers have been able to communicate with a
presential or remote machine monitored by this
system.
Moreover AGORA has the possibility of
incorporating new services since it&apos;s a platform
of association, composed by a Kernel and an
increasing amount of modules or subdialogues.
Another important advantage of AGORA is
its infrastructure that facilitates the fast
generation of new services and applications.
Therefore, it&apos;s not a system that just works for
certain services. In fact, it&apos;s been used in a wide
range of customer services like information
services, Voice Portals, etc.
AGORA is also multilingual and so has the
ability to keep dialogues in different languages.
By changing only three configuration files, the
system is able to &amp;quot;speak&amp;quot; in the selected
language.

2 Main Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984397">
Mixed Initiative: the system is able to
understand and provide proper interpretation for
all the user intentions, in whatever order they
appear, and even if the focus of the dialogue has
been changed by the user. This means that the
user can request to do a task giving the necessary
data to complete it in the order that he wants. If
the system needs any other information from the
user, it will ask him directly. If it&apos;s not possible
to receive that information, the system will help

the user or it will tell him what he can do to
achieve his objective.
Expert Subdialogues: To improve robustness
against recognition errors in mass data obtention
we provide different modules that require several
complex processes that have been isolated and
implemented with the strategies of Segmentation
of data structures and Generation of Echoes.
Proactivity: This feature allows the system to
take the initiative in certain moments of the
dialogue, making suggestions and giving the
requested information according to the tastes and
frequent uses of the user. Proactivity produces
changes in the strategies of dialogue control
depending on on-line measurements of certain
parameters described in section 3.
Multiservice System: One important
advantage of AGORA is its infrastructure, which
facilitates the fast generation of new services and
applications. The association of these new ser-
vices is done thanks to a dynamic context change
system that also allows the user to change the
topic of the conversation at any particular
moment of the dialogue as well as moving from
one service to another just by asking to do so in a
colloquial way. Therefore, the user doesn&apos;t need
to use any menus or move back in the dialogue.
This context change ability leads to a free
dialogue between the user and the system.
Multiplatform system: since AGORA is a
platform of association, we can integrate in it
other services done in different platforms (like
Voice-XML system) and vice versa. The
multiplatform is based upon a module (Watcher
Agent) that keeps the surveillance of the system
and controls in every moment the interrelation
and the dispatching of tasks among all the asso-
ciated services (see Figure 1).
Multffingual Dynamic system: AGORA has
being designed to be a multilingual SLDS and
initially it is able to hold dialogues in Spanish,
Catalan, as well as in Latin American Spanish.
Moreover the user can change the language at
any particular moment of the conversation. As
we allow a dynamic change of language during
the progress of any dialogue, our architecture
must deal with the dynamic activation and
deactivation of these resources for a particular
language.

<bodyText confidence="0.9996662">
AGORA has a distributed and modular
architecture where it is remarkable the Kernel
and its satellite modules that can be transformed
in expert subdialogues that assume the control in
certain moments of the conversation and are
always controlled by the Interpreters of the
Kernel. The Linguistic Kernel contains the
independent knowledge of the system, related to
the dialogue management. The rest of the
configurable modules are adjusted to the design
of the different services using the Fast
Environment Generation of Speech
Applications (SQUEL Tool), a strategy for
designing and implementing the entire domain in
a fast and efficient way.

(kernel) and task-dependent (configurable mo-
dules).
Two main interpreters can describe the
functionality of the Dialogue Management in
AGORA: the Conversation Manager and the
Dialogue Acts Interpreter (see Figure 2). The
Conversation Manager is responsible for the
dialogue control un der some especial
circumstances related to the context of the
dialogue that break the normal flow of the
interaction with the user like no-response and
early detection of misunderstanding situations.
The Dialogue Acts Interpreter controls all the
exchanges during the normal flow of the
dialogue, including slot-filling, error recovery
subdialogues control, information exchange with
external resources, and output messages
generation. The Conversation Manager also
includes a User and Proactivity Behavior
Module, which is responsible for the automatic
detection of different user behavior patterns, and
the activation of the corresponding user&apos;s adapted
strategies. Moreover it controls the multilingual
change and the Output Generator.
Application Describer of thc Task. This
module contains the main functions and the ge-
neral behaviour of the dialogue of a particular
service. The configuration of the application
knowledge have to be projected under appro-
priate guide-lines, and if it&apos;s done maintaining the
coherency among all configurable modules,
configuration rules and application
characteristics, the Describer Module is
converted to an exceptional collector of the
information given by the user. This information
is collected according to a group of attributes
previously defined in XML Language that are
responsible (among other factors) for the
behaviour of the system during the dialogue. The
Describer also defines different &amp;quot;squeletons&amp;quot; for
the rest of the modules of the application, and
this allows a faster design of the services.
Multilingual Generator of Outgoing
Phrases. The multilingual feature of the system
needs to look for a general dialogue structure
separated from a specific language. This could be
achieved by abstract dialogue forms, as in the
case of the semantic parsing these could be
dialogue labels. These labels have their
correspondent utterance forms in the output
content for con each language. This multilingual
feature faces us with two main requirements:
- AGORA needs to have control (see Figure 2) over
multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-
to-Speech engines and Semantic Parsers. Furthermore,
as we allow a dynamic change of language during the
progress of a particular dialogue, our architecture must
deal with the dynamic activation/deactivation of these
resources for a particular language.
- We need to define language-independent
dialogue labels to represent the output of the different
parsers for different languages in order to produce the
same semantic content. We do that by specifying what
kind of specific dialogue label or dialogue functions
the user will be allowed to perform. A dialogue label
such as yes-answer would then correspond to a
grammar YES-ANSWER for all possible ways of
answering yes in this kind of dialogue in one
particular language.

Proactivity Module. The behavior change that
the system does according to its proactivity is
produced through a prediction made by the
combination of the measurement of certain
parameters as follow:
Evolution Capacity: The capacity that the user has
to follow the conversation with a focused objective.

conversation. According to this, the system will
provide suitable help to the user whether he requests it
or not.
User preferences: the preferences of the user can
be collected when he expresses them spontaneously or
by the observation of the previous times he has
entered the system (frequent uses). With this
information, the system will be able to inform the user
of those actions classified as his favorites, and it will
anticipate this way to the requests of the user,
although it will always leave him the initiave.
System&apos;s Predictions. To achieve this proactivity,
the Interpreters of the Kernel evaluate the knowledge
that it&apos;s gathered during the conversation and they
divide it in two different structures; the Instantaneous
Knowledge (kept just during each interaction) and the
Permanent Knowledge (kept during the whole
conversation or for the most part of it). These two
knowledges inform the rest of the modules about the
situation of the conversation and which one is the goal
expressed by the user. Then, the Dialogue Manager
evaluates the possible alternatives in order to take finally a
decision that is translated in an outgoing phrase.

4 Demonstration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975966740740741">
As a framework to test and validate the
architecture and NLP features provided by our
AGORA SLDS , we will present a demonstration
of its use in the development of a state-of-the-art
Voice Portal for Mobile Telephony.
Demonstration of Portal &amp;quot;AGIL&amp;quot;: In this
system we integrate several services with diffe-
rent levels of dialogue complexity that demand
different dialogue strategies. The particular ser-
vices our Voice Portal include are the following:
iCt *it -Information based services:
Traffic, News and Meeting, Weather informs.
A k -Interactive voice access to a TV guide.
Eli e -Personal-agenda: appointments.
I UK; - A hotel reservation facility.
&gt;-&lt; - Voice access to electronic
Mail: Voice mail operation.
Itit t t - Recharge mobile or cash card.
Another important feature this demonstration
will point out is the multilingual capability of
our environment. All the interactions with the
Voice Portal can be done either in Spanish,
Catalan or Latin American Spanish. Moreover a
user can switch dynamically from one language
to another just saying expressions like &amp;quot;now I
prefer to speak in Catalan&amp;quot;. We will illustrate,
therefore, in a real application working on a
mobile telephony platform, this multilingual and
multiservice environment with Proactivity.
Demonstration of SQUEL Environment:
Our Environment Services Generation Tool;
&amp;quot;SQUEL&amp;quot;, for the design and development of a
complex SLDS, is based on the basic architecture
of AGORA and it has tools and facilities for the
Design, Generation, Configuration and
Administration of new services. To take
advantage of this capacity it has been created a
method for designing new services that monitors
the process. This method is thought to ease the
designer&apos;s work and make it more comfortable.
SQUEL is used in sequential phases:
The Design phase: the general behaviour of the system is
thought and defined. The service is also structured depen-
ding on its nature; if it&apos;s sequential or distributed, with
subdialogues or without them (Figure 1), etc.
The Configuration phase: once the Describer is
completed, the system get its semantics concepts from the
parser and the Output Phrases get labelled according the
different states of the conversation and the acts of dialogue
that the system manager need to consider.
Finally, the Module of the Management of Resources
(TTS, Recogniser, Player, Record, etc.) would get confi-
gured according to the language employed by the user and
the system in their conversation.
