CROSS-VOWEL PHONOTACTIC CONSTRAINTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969560439561">
Fudge (1969), Clements and Keyser (1983), and Davis
(1984) have all pointed out a number of systematic
phonotactic constraints holding between a prevocalic
and a postvocalic consonant in English monosyllabic
words. One of the strongest of these constraints, and
one that has been observed by all three of the above
mentioned researchers, is that there are no monosyl-
labic words of the form sCVC in which the same
non-coronal (labial or velar) consonant flanks both sides
of the vowel. Hence there are no English words like
&amp;quot;spep&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;skik&amp;quot;. Another constraint, noted by Davis
(1984), is that there are no monosyllabic words of the
form sNVN (where N can be any nasal consonant).
Thus there are no words in English like &amp;quot;snam&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;sming&amp;quot;. Here, I point out that these two constraints
are in fact more general. Both these constraints are
more general in that they are not just constraints on
monosyllabic words or on single syllables, rather they
are constraints on any sequence of sCVC (or sNVN)
regardless where in the word (or, rather, morpheme)
that sCVC sequence (or sNVN equence) occurs. Also,
the constraint on sCVC sequences is not just a con-
straint on identical consonants flanking both sides of the
vowel, but on homorganic consonants (i.e., consonants
having the same place of articulation) flanking both
sides of the vowel.
Are the systematic constraints on sCVC sequences
(in which the Cs are identical noncoronal consonants)
and sNVN sequences (in which the N is any nasal
consonant) which hold for English monosyllabic words
actually general constraints on English syllables as is
assumed by Davis (1984) (and also by Clements and
Keyser 1983)? If, in fact, these are constraints on
English syllables, one would expect to find words
containing the sequence sCVCV (or sNVNV) since the
postvocalic C (or N) would not be part of the initial
syllable. So, for example, one might expect that there
would be words like &amp;quot;skicky&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spapoon&amp;quot; in which
the postvocalic consonant is not part of the initial
syllable, but there would not be words like &amp;quot;skick&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;spap&amp;quot; in which the postvocalic consonant is part of
the initial syllable. If, on the other hand, the constraint
on sCVC sequences (and sNVN sequences) is actually
a constraint on a sequence of sounds, regardless of
whether the sounds are all in the same syllable, then
possible words or sequences like &amp;quot;skicky&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spa-
poon&amp;quot; would be non-occurring or at least extremely
rare. A search was done on a computerized lexicon
containing nearly 20,000 words from Webster&apos;s Pocket
Dictionary to see if the sequences sCVC and sNVN.
occur in any polysyllabic words. The only word in this
lexicon in which the sequence sCVC is found (where the
Cs are identical non-coronal consonants) is the word
&amp;quot;dyspepsia&amp;quot; where the sequence &amp;quot;spep&amp;quot; occurs. No
other such words were found. Polysyllabic words hav-
ing the sequence sCVC where the two Cs are not
identical are much more common. A search through the
20,000-word lexicon gives us such words as &amp;quot;spa-
ghetti&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;scaffold&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;scuba&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;eskimo&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;epis-
copal&amp;quot;. Thus it appears that the constraint on sCVC
sequences is not really a constraint only holding within
a syllable, but is a constraint on a sequence of sounds
holding within a word. (Notice that in the exceptional
word &amp;quot;dyspepsia&amp;quot; the sequence &amp;quot;spep&amp;quot; spans a mor-
pheme boundary since the s is part of the prefix &amp;quot;dys-&amp;quot;,
which occurs in words like &amp;quot;dysfunction&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dyspha-
sia&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;dystrophy&amp;quot;.)
At first glance, the search through the lexicon of
polysyllabic words containing the sequence sNVN sug-
gests that the constraint on the sequence sNVN does
not hold for polysyllabic words, unlike the constraint on
sCVC sequences. The following 12 words containing
the sequence sNVN were found: casement, congress-
man, dismantle, emplacement, fastening (with the or-
thographic e between the t and the n being deleted in
pronunciation), marksman, placement, pronouncement,
replacement, spokesman, statesman, and talisman.
However, these words, like the exceptional &amp;quot;dyspep-
sia&amp;quot; mentioned above, are not monomorphemic; all of
these words (with the possible exception of &amp;quot;talisman&amp;quot;)
involve morpheme boundaries between the s and the
following nasal consonant. These data thus indicate that
the constraint on sNVN sequences (as well as on sCVC
sequences) are constraints on a sequence of sounds that
hold within morphemes; they can be considered mor-
pheme structure constraints, not word level or syllable
structure constraints.
The constraint disallowing (monomorphemic) sCVC
sequences (in which the Cs are identical non-coronal
consonants) on further investigation turns out to be a
more general constraint in that the two Cs do not have

to be identical; rather, they cannot be articulated in the
same place in the vocal tract. That is, there are virtually
no monomorphemic words in English that have the
sequence sCVC where the two Cs are either both labial
or both velar. The only word in the 20,000-word lexicon
that was found to violate this constraint is the word
&amp;quot;skunk&amp;quot;. The words &amp;quot;skag&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;spam&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;spumoni&amp;quot;
would also violate the constraint although they were not
listed in the lexicon. That this constraint really does
involve identical place of articulation is made evident
when we consider the situation where the two Cs in an
sCVC sequence are not homorganic. A search through
the 20,000-word computerized lexicon revealed that no
constraint whatsoever held when the two Cs were made
at different locations in the vocal tract. For example,
the sequence skV was followed by a labial consonant in
58 entries (e.g., &amp;quot;skip&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;scuba&amp;quot;), an alveolar conso-
nant in 151 entries (e.g., skit, skate), and a palato-
alveolar consonant in 25 entries (e.g., scotch, sketch).
The fact that there were virtually no words with a velar
consonant following an skV sequence is of interest.
Moreover, the sequence spV was followed by a velar
consonant in 56 entries (e.g., spike, spook), an alveolar
consonant in 196 entries (e.g., spit, speed), and a
palato-alveolar consonant in 20 entries (e.g., speech,
special); there were virtually no words where a labial
consonant followed an spV sequence. Thus it is con-
cluded that the constraint on sCVC sequences originally
formulated by Clements and Keyser (1983) and Davis
(1984) as a constraint on the occurrence of identical
non-coronal consonants is in fact a more general con-
straint on consonants made in the same place of artic-
ulation.
Although the constraint against having homorganic
(non-coronal) consonants flanking both sides of the
vowel in a sCVC sequence seems to be a real constraint
of English, it remains somewhat of a mystery why there
should be such a constraint. The constraint crucially
must include s since there is no constraint on English
CVC sequences where the two Cs are homorganic. A
check through the 20,000-word computerized lexicon
found 118 entries for words having (non-nasal) labial
consonants flanking both sides of the vowel in a CVC
sequence and 138 entries for words having a velar
consonant flanking both sides of a vowel in a CVC
sequence. Thus this constraint only involves an sCVC
sequence and not any CVC sequence. I offer no expla-
nation for why the presence of the s in an sCVC
sequence essentially places a restriction on the postvo-
calic consonant. It is conjectured, though, that while the
reason for such a constraint is a mystery, speakers of
English make use of them for parsing words in contin-
uous speech. For example, given the constraint on
sCVC sequences discussed in this paper, phonetic se-
quences like [spaIpleIn] (i.e., spy plane) and [ItsmaIn]
(i.e., it&apos;s mine) can only be parsed as &amp;quot;spy plane&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;it&apos;s mine&amp;quot;, respectively. They cannot be parsed as
&amp;quot;spipe lane&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it smine&amp;quot;, respectively, nor could
they be parsed as single words. It is quite possible that
speakers of English can and do make use of such
phonota ctic constraints.
