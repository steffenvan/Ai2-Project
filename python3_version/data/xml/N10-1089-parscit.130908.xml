<bodyText confidence="0.999728388888889">
There is significant evidence in the literature
that integrating knowledge about multiword
expressions can improve shallow parsing ac-
curacy. We present an experimental study to
quantify this improvement, focusing on com-
pound nominals, proper names and adjective-
noun constructions. The evaluation set of
multiword expressions is derived from Word-
Net and the textual data are downloaded from
the web. We use a classification method to
aid human annotation of output parses. This
method allows us to conduct experiments on
a large dataset of unannotated data. Experi-
ments show that knowledge about multiword
expressions leads to an increase of between
7.5% and 9.5% in accuracy of shallow pars-
ing in sentences containing these multiword
expressions.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850311111111">
Multiword expressions are sequences of words that
tend to co-occur more frequently than chance and
are characterised by various levels of idiosyncracy
(Baldwin et al., 2003; Baldwin, 2006). There is ex-
tended literature on various issues relevant to mul-
tiword expression; recognition, classification, lexi-
cography, etc. (see Section 6). The vast majority of
these publications identifies as motivation for mul-
tiword expression research its potential contribution
to deep or shallow parsing. On the other side of this
issue, the state-of-the-art parsing systems seem to
ignore the fact that treating multiword expressions
as syntactic units would potentially increase parser’s
accuracy.
In this paper, we present an experimental study
attempting to estimate the contribution of integrat-
ing multiword expressions into shallow parsing. We
focus on multiword expressions that consist of two
successive tokens; in particular, compound nominals
proper names and adjective-noun constructions. We
also present a detailed classification method to aid
human annotation during the procedure of deciding
if a parse is correct or wrong. We present experi-
mental results about the different classes of changes
that occur in the parser output while unifying multi-
word expression components.
We conclude that treating known multiwords ex-
pressions as singletons leads to an increase of be-
tween 7.5% and 9.5% in accuracy of shallow pars-
ing of sentences containing these multiword expres-
sions. Increase percentages are higher for multiword
expressions that consist of an adjective followed by
a noun (12% to 15%); and even higher for non-
compositional multiword expressions1 that consist
of an adjective and a noun (15.5% to 19.5%).
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In
Section 2 we present how multiword expressions can
be annotated in text and used by a shallow parser. In
Section 3 we present an overview of our experimen-
tal process. Section 4 explains how the set of target
multiword expressions and textual corpora were cre-
ated. In Section 5 we present and discuss the results
of the experimental process. In Section 6 we present
parts of the related literature. Section 7 concludes
the paper and proposes some future work.

2 Annotating Multiword expressions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927">
In this paper, we present a study to inspect the ex-
tent to which knowledge of multiword expressions
improves shallow parsing. Our approach focuses
on English multiword expressions that appear as se-
quences in text. In particular, we focus on com-
pound nominals (e.g. lemon tree), proper names
(e.g. prince Albert) and adjective-noun construc-
tions (e.g. red carpet).
Shallow or deep parsing should treat multiword
expression as units that cannot be divided in any
way. We replace the multiword expression tokens
with a special made up token, i.e. the multiword ex-
pression constituents joined with an underscore. For
example, we replace all occurrences of “lemon tree”
with “lemon tree”.
We choose to replace the multiword expression
words with a token that does not exist in the dictio-
nary of the part of speech tagger. This is quite an
important decision. Usually, a part of sheech tagger
assigns to an unknown words the part of speech that
best fits to it with respect to the parts of speech of
the words around it and the training data. This is a
desirable behaviour for our purposes.
The experimental results of our study quantify the
difference between the shallow parser output of a big
number of sentences after the replacement and the
shallow parser output of the same sentences before
the replacement. The comparison is done ignoring
changes of parts of speech, assigned by the part of
speech tagger.

3 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832785714286">
The target of our experiment is to evaluate whether
replacing the multiword expression tokens with a
single token, unknown to the part of speech tagger,
improves shallow parsing accuracy. The ideal way
to perform this evaluation would be to use a cor-
pus with manual annotation about parsing and mul-
tiword expressions. Given this corpus we would be
able to measure the accuracy of a shallow (or deep)
parser before and after replacing multiword expres-
sions. However, to the best of our knowledge there
is no corpus available to include this type of annota-
tions in English.
Instead, there are two options: Firstly, we can
use treebank data, where manual parsing annotation
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999763">
Figure 1: Evaluation process

<bodyText confidence="0.999479058823529">
is readily available, and manually annotate multi-
word expressions. The advantage of this approach
is that results are directly comparable with other re-
sults of the literature, due to the use of benchmark
data. Manual annotation of multiword expressions
is a very time- and effort-consuming process due to
the large size of most treebanks. Alternatively, mul-
tiword expression annotation could be done using a
method of recognition. Annotating the multiword
expressions that appear in WordNet could be a safe
decision, in terms of correctness, however, WordNet
is reported to have limited coverage of multiword
expressions (Baldwin, 2006; Laporte and Voyatzi,
2008). WordNet covers only 9.1 % and 16.1 % of the
datasets of Nicholson and Baldwin (2008) (484 noun
compounds) and Kim and Baldwin (2008) (2169
noun compounds), respectively.
Secondly, we can use a set of multiword expres-
sions as a starting point and then create corpora that
contain instances of these multiword expressions. In
succession, these sentences need to be manually an-
notated in terms of parsing, and this requires huge
human effort. Alternatively, we can parse the cor-
pora before and after replacing the multiword ex-
pression and then compare the parser output. This
is the evaluation procedure that we chose to follow,
and is shown in Figure 1.
The above procedure is only able to retrieve in-
stances where the replacement of the multiword ex-
pression leads to a different parsing, a different allo-
cation of tokens to phrases. It is not able to spot in-
stances where the parser output remains unchanged
after the replacement, no matter if they are correct.

multiword expressions with a single token improves
parsing accuracy, we are not interested in instances
that remain unchanged. We focus on instances that
changed; either they were corrected or they were
made wrong or they remain erroneous. For example,
the shallow parser output for example A in Table 1
did not change after the replacement. Example B in
Table 1 shows a sentence which was corrected after
the replacement.
Instead of manually annotating the sentences
whose parser output changed after the replacement
as corrected or not, we identify a number of change
classes under which we classify all these sentences.
In the following section, we present the change
classes. For each we thoroughly discuss whether
its form guarantees that its sentences are wrongly
parsed before the change and correctly parsed after
the change. In this case, the sentences of the corre-
sponding class should be counted as false positives.
We also discuss the opposite; if the form of each
change class guarantees that its sentences are cor-
rectly parsed before the change and wrongly parsed
after the change. In this case, the sentences of the
corresponding class should be counted as true nega-
tives. For this discussion we hypothesize that among
the possible output shallow parses for a given sen-
tence the correct one has (a) the smallest number
phrases, and (b) the smallest number of tokens not
assigned to any phrase.

ters V...Z denote phrase labels. Lowercase letters k...n

different from the parser output of the same sen-
tence after replacing the multiword expression with
a single token. The secondary focus of this discus-
sion is to estimate whether the specific form of each
change class can lead to a safe conclusion about if
the parser output of the sentence under discussion:
(a) was wrong before the replacement and was then
corrected, (b) was correct before the replacement
and was then made wrong, or (c) was wrong before
the replacement and remained wrong. For this dis-
cussion, we refer to words that are not assigned to
any phase in the shallow parser output as “leaves”.
Hypothesis: We base our analysis on the hypoth-
esis that among the possible output shallow parses
for a given sentence the correct one has (a) the small-
est number phrases, and (b) the smallest number of
leaves. The theoretical intuitions behind the hypoth-
esis are: (a) parse trees with just leaves are par-
tial parse trees and hence should not be preferred
over complete parse trees. (b) when mistaken parse

trees are generally larger (with more phrases). We
checked the hypothesis by manually annotating 80
randomly chosen instances; 10 for each change class
that is counted as correct or wrong (see Table 2). 74
instances validated the hypothesis (92.5%).
Table 2 shows one example for each change class.
Figure 2 presents the classes as transformations be-
tween trees, following the notation of Bille (2005).
Change class P2LMw (Phrase to Leaves includ-
ing the Multiword expression) Before replacing the
multiword expression sequence with a single to-
ken, the multiword expression is assigned to some
phrase, possibly together with other words. After
the replacement, the components of that phrase are
not assigned to any phrase, but instead as leaves.
Change class P2L (Phrase to Leaves excluding
the multiword expression) Similarly to change class
P2LMw, before the replacement, some successive
tokens excluding the multiword expression itself are
assigned to some phrase. After the replacement, the
components of that phrase appear as leaves.
Change class L2PMw (Leaves to Phrase includ-
ing the Multiword expression) The changes covered
by this class are the opposite changes of change class
P2LMw. Before the replacing the multiword expres-
sion sequence with a single token, the multiword ex-
pression sequence is not assign to any phrase possi-
bly among other words. After the replacement, the
multiword expression is assigned to a phrase.
Change class L2P (Leaves to Phrase excluding
the multiword expression) Similarly to change class
L2PMw, before the replacement, one or more suc-
cessive tokens excluding the multiword expression
itself appear as leaves. After the replacement, these
tokens are assigned to a phrase.
Change class PL2P (Phrases or Leaves to Phrase)
After the replacement, the tokens of more than one
phrases or leaves are assigned to a single phrase.
Change class P2PL (Phrase to Phrases or Leaves)
In contrast to change class PL2P, after the replace-
ment, the tokens of one phrase either are assigned to
more than one phrases or appear as leaves.
Change class PN (Phrase label Name) After re-
placing the multiword expression sequence with a
single token, one phrase appears with a different
phrase label, although it retains exactly the same
component tokens.
Change class PoS (Part of Speech) After replac-
ing the multiword expression sequence with a single
token, one or more tokens appears with a different
part of speech. This class of changes comes from the
part of speech tagger, and are out of the scope of this
study. Thus, in the results section we show a size es-
timate of this class, and then we present results about
change classes, ignoring change class PoS.
Change class P2P (Phrases to less Phrases) After
replacing the multiword expression sequence with a
single token, the component tokens of more than one
successive phrases α are assigned to a different set of
successive phrases Q. However, it is always the case
that phrases α are less than phrases Q (|α |&lt; |Q|).
Change class MwA (Multiword expression
Allocation) Before replacing the multiword ex-
pression sequence, the multiword expression
constituents are assigned to different phrases.
The instances of change classes where the parser
output after the replacement has more parsing leaves
or phrases than before are counted towards sen-
tences that were parsed wrongly after the replace-
ment. For these classes, change classes P2LMw,
P2L and P2PL, most probably the parser output after
the replacement is wrong.
In contrast, the instances of change classes where
a sequence of tokens is assigned to a phrase, or many
phrases are merged are counted towards sentences
that were parsed wrongly before the replacement
and correctly after the replacement. These changes,
that are described by classes L2PMw, L2P, PL2P
and P2P, most probably describe improvements in
shallow parsing. The instances of change class MwA
are counted as correct after the replacement because
by definition all tokens of a multiword expression
are expected to be assigned to the same phrase.
The instances of change class PN can be either
correct or wrong after the replacement. For this rea-
son, we present our results as ranges (see Table 4).
The minimum value is computed when the instances
of class PN are counted as wrong after the replace-
ment. In contrast, the maximum value is computed
when the instances of this class are counted as cor-
rect after the replacement.

classes of change happened. For example, in a num-

120. Keeping the ones that consist of two tokens
resulted in the 118 expressions of Table 3. Manu-

pression appears. Snippets were collected follow-
ing Korkontzelos and Manandhar (2009). Given a
multiword expression, a set of queries is created:
All synonyms of the multiword expression extracted
from WordNet are collected2. The multiword ex-
pression is paired with each synonym to create a set
of queries. For each query, snippets are collected
by parsing the web-pages returned by Yahoo!. The
union of all snippets produces the multiword expres-

The corpora collecting procedure of Section 4 re-
sulted in a corpus of 376,007 sentences, each one
containing one or more multiword expressions. In
85, 527 sentences (22.75%), the shallow parser out-
put before the replacement is different than the shal-
low parser output after the replacement. 7.20% of
these change instances are due to one or more parts
of speech changes, and are classified to change class
PoS. In other words, in 7.20% of cases where there
is a difference between the shallow parses before
and after replacing the multiword expression tokens
there is one or more tokens that were assigned a dif-
ferent part of speech. However, excluding parts of
speech from the comparison, there is no other dif-
ference between the two parses.
The focus of this study is to quantify the effect
of unifying multiword expressions in shallow pars-
ing. Part of speech tagging is a component of our ap-
proach and parts of speech are not necessarily parts
of the parser output. For this reason, we chose to
ignore part of speech changes, the changes of class
PoS. Below, we discuss results for all other classes.

Table 4 shows a summary of our results. The first
two columns describe classes of multiword expres-
sion with respect to compositionality and the parts
of speech of the component words. The first line ac-
counts for the average of all multiword expressions,
the second one for compositional multiword expres-
sions made of nouns, etc. The third column shows
the number of corpus sentences of each class.
For each one of the classes of Table 4, the fourth
and fifth columns show the minimum and maxi-
mum improvement in shallow parsing, respectively,
caused by unifying multiword expression tokens.
Let IIXII be the function that returns the number of
instances assigned to change class X. With respect
to the discussion of Subsection 3.1 about how the in-
stances of each class should be counted towards the
final results, the minimum and maximum improve-
ments in shallow parsing are:

On average of all multiword expressions, unify-
ing multiword expression tokens contributes from
7.47% to 9.49% in shallow parsing accuracy. It
should be noted that this improvement is reported
on sentences which contain at least one known mul-
tiword expression. To project this improvement on
any general text, one needs to know the percentage
of sentences that contain known multiword expres-

sions. Then the projected improvement can be com-
puted by multiplying these two percentages.
Table 4 shows that the increase in shallow pars-
ing accuracy is lower for expressions that consist of
nouns than for those that consist of an adjective and
a noun. Moreover, the improvement is higher for
non-compositional expressions than compositional
ones. This is expected, due to the idiosyncratic na-
ture of non-compositional multiword expressions.
The highest improvement, 15.32% to 19.67%, oc-
curs for non-compositional multiword expressions
that consist of an adjective followed by a noun.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of each class over
the sum of sentences whose parse before unify-
ing multiword expression tokens is different for the
parse after the replacement. The most common
change class is PL2P. It contains sentences in the
shallow parser output of which many phrases or
leaves were all assigned to a single phrase. 34.03%
of the changes are classified in this class. The least
common classes are change classes P2L, L2PMw
and L2P. Each of these accounts for less than 3%
of the overall changes.

There have been proposed several ways to clas-

properties such as compositionality and institution-

ing methods into statistical (e.g. pointwise mutual
information (PMI)), translation-based, dictionary-
based, substitution-based, and distributional. Sta-
tistical methods score multiword expression candi-
dates based on co-occurrence counts (Manning and
Schutze, 1999; Dunning, 1993; Lin, 1999; Frantzi et
al., 2000). Translation-based methods usually take
advantage of alignment to discover potential multi-
word expressions (Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005).
Other methods use dictionaries to reveal semantic
relationships between the components of potential
multiword expressions and their context (Baldwin
et al., 2003; Hashimoto et al., 2006). Substitution-
based methods decide for multiword expressions
by substituting their components with other similar
words and measuring their frequency of occurrence
(Lin, 1999; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006). These tech-
niques can be enriched with selectional preference
information (Van de Cruys and Moir´on, 2007; Katz
and Giesbrecht, 2006). Fazly and Stevenson (2007)
propose measures for institutionalisation, syntactic
fixedness and compositionality based on the selec-
tional preferences of verbs. There are several studies
relevant to detecting compositionality of noun-noun,
verb-particle and light verb constructions and verb-
noun pairs (e.g. Katz and Giesbrecht (2006)).
To the best of our knowledge there are no ap-
proaches integrating multiword expression knowl-
edge in deep or shallow parsing. However, there
are several attempts to integrate other forms of lex-
ical semantics into parsing. Bikel (2000) merged
the Brown portion of the Penn Treebank with Sem-
Cor, and used it to evaluate a generative bilexical
model for joint word sense disambiguation and pars-
ing. Similarly, Agirre et al. (Agirre et al., 2008)
integrated semantic information in the form of se-
mantic classes and observed significant improve-
ment in parsing and PP attachment tasks. Xiong et
al. (2005) integrated first-sense and hypernym fea-
tures in a generative parse model applied to the Chi-
nese Penn Treebank and achieved significant im-
provement over their baseline model. Fujita et
al. (2007) extended this work by implementing a
discriminative parse selection model, incorporating
word sense information and achieved great improve-
ments as well. Examples of integrating selectional
preference information into parsing are Dowding et
al. (1994) and Hektoen (1997).

In this paper, we presented an experimental study
attempting to estimate the contribution of unify-
ing multiword expression components into shallow
parsing. The evaluation is done based on 118 multi-
word expressions extracted from WordNet 3.0. They
consist of two successive components and are in
particular, compound nominals, proper names or
adjective-noun constructions.
Instead of using pre-annotated text, we collected
sentences that contain the above multiword expres-
sions from the web. We applied shallow parsing be-
fore and after unifying multiword expression tokens
and compared the outputs. We presented a detailed
classification of changes in the shallow parser out-
put to aid human annotation during the procedure of
deciding if a parser output is correct or wrong.
We presented experimental results about change
classes and about the overall improvement of uni-
fying multiword expression tokens with respect to
compositionality and the parts of speech of their
components. We conclude that unifying the tokens
of known multiwords expressions leads to an in-
crease of between 7.5% and 9.5% in accuracy of
shallow parsing of sentences that contain these mul-
tiword expressions. Increase percentages are higher
on adjective-noun constructions (12% to 15%); and
even higher on non-compositional adjective-noun
constructions (15.5% to 19.5%).
Future work will focus in conducting similar ex-
periments for multiword expressions longer than
two words. One would expect that due to their
size, a wrong interpretation of their structure would
affect the shallow parser output more than it does
for multiword expressions consisting of two words.
Thus, unifying multiword expressions longer than
two words would potentially contribute more to
shallow parsing accuracy.
Furthermore, the evaluation results presented in
this paper could be strengthened by adding man-
ual multiword expression annotation to some tree-
bank. This would provide a way to avoid the change
class analysis presented in Subsection 3.1 and com-
pute statistics more accurately. Finally, the results of
this paper suggest that implementing a parser able
to recognise multiword expressions would be very
helpful towards high accuracy parsing.

The advantage of this approach is that results are directly comparable with other results of the literature, due to the use of benchmark data. Manual annotation of multiword expressions is a very time- and effort-consuming process due to the large size of most treebanks. Alternatively, multiword expression annotation could be done using a method of recognition. Annotating the multiword expressions that appear in WordNet could be a safe decision, in terms of correctness, however, WordNet is reported to have limited coverage of multiword expressions (Baldwin, 2006; Laporte and Voyatzi, 2008).

In this case, the sentences of the corresponding class should be counted as true negatives. For this discussion we hypothesize that among the possible output shallow parses for a given sentence the correct one has (a) the smallest number phrases, and (b) the smallest number of tokens not assigned to any phrase. 3.1 Shallow parsing change classes In this section, we present a classification of cases where the shallow parser output of the sentence is Figure 2: Change classes (following the notation of Bille (2005)). Triangles denote phrases and uppercase bold letters V...Z denote phrase labels. Lowercase letters k...n denote parsing leaves. For change classes P2LMw and L2PMw, X includes the multiword expression tokens. For change classes P2L and L2P it does not. For change class MwA, the multiword expression tokens are not assigned to the same phrase Y or Z. different from the parser output of the same sentence after replacing the multiword expression with a single token.

The theoretical intuitions behind the hypothesis are: (a) parse trees with just leaves are partial parse trees and hence should not be preferred over complete parse trees. (b) when mistaken parse 638 trees are generally larger (with more phrases). We checked the hypothesis by manually annotating 80 randomly chosen instances; 10 for each change class that is counted as correct or wrong (see Table 2). 74 instances validated the hypothesis (92.5%). Table 2 shows one example for each change class. Figure 2 presents the classes as transformations between trees, following the notation of Bille (2005). Change class P2LMw (Phrase to Leaves including the Multiword expression) Before replacing the multiword expression sequence with a single token, the multiword expression is assigned to some phrase, possibly together with other words. After the replacement, the components of that phrase are not assigned to any phrase, but instead as leaves. Change class P2L (Phrase to Leaves excluding the multiword expression) Similarly to change class P2LMw, before the replacement, some successive tokens excluding the multiword expression itself are assigned to some phrase.

For example, in a number of instances, before the replacement, the multiword expression constituents are assigned to different phrases (change class MwA). After the replacement, the tokens of more than one phrases are assigned to a single phrase (change class PL2P). These instances consist new complex change classes and are named as the sum of names of the participating classes. The instances of the example above consist the complex change class PL2P+MwA. 4 Target multiword expressions and corpora collection We created our set of target multiword expressions using WordNet 3.0 (Miller, 1995). Out of its 52,217 multiword expressions we randomly chose 120. Keeping the ones that consist of two tokens resulted in the 118 expressions of Table 3. Manually inspecting these multiword expressions proved that they are all compound nominals, proper names or adjective-noun constructions. Each multiword expression was manually tagged as compositional or non-compositional, following the procedure described in Korkontzelos and Manandhar (2009).

Manual annotation of multiword expressions is a very time- and effort-consuming process due to the large size of most treebanks. Alternatively, multiword expression annotation could be done using a method of recognition. Annotating the multiword expressions that appear in WordNet could be a safe decision, in terms of correctness, however, WordNet is reported to have limited coverage of multiword expressions (Baldwin, 2006; Laporte and Voyatzi, 2008). WordNet covers only 9.1 % and 16.1 % of the datasets of Nicholson and Baldwin (2008) (484 noun compounds) and Kim and Baldwin (2008) (2169 noun compounds), respectively. Secondly, we can use a set of multiword expressions as a starting point and then create corpora that contain instances of these multiword expressions. In succession, these sentences need to be manually annotated in terms of parsing, and this requires huge human effort. Alternatively, we can parse the corpora before and after replacing the multiword expression and then compare the parser output. This is the evaluation procedure that we chose to follow, and is shown in Figure 1. The above procedure is only able</context>

To the best of our knowledge there are no approaches integrating multiword expression knowledge in deep or shallow parsing. However, there are several attempts to integrate other forms of lexical semantics into parsing. Bikel (2000) merged the Brown portion of the Penn Treebank with SemCor, and used it to evaluate a generative bilexical model for joint word sense disambiguation and parsing. Similarly, Agirre et al. (Agirre et al., 2008) integrated semantic information in the form of semantic classes and observed significant improvement in parsing and PP attachment tasks. Xiong et al. (2005) integrated first-sense and hypernym features in a generative parse model applied to the Chinese Penn Treebank and achieved significant improvement over their baseline model. Fujita et al. (2007) extended this work by implementing a discriminative parse selection model, incorporating word sense information and achieved great improvements as well. Examples of integrating selectional preference information into parsing are Dowding et al. (1994) and Hektoen (1997). 7 Conlusion and future work In this paper, we presented an experimental study attempting to estimate the contribution of unifying mul</context>
