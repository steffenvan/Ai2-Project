ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.993461909090909">
In the paper the use of the notion
&amp;quot;obligatory complement&amp;quot; in syntactic
analysis is discussed. In many theories
which serve as bases for syntactic
analysis procedures there are devices to
express the difference between obligatory
and optional complements on the rule
level, i.e. via the lexicon the wordforms
are connected with these rules where the
fitting properties are expressed. I&apos;ll
show that such an approach leads to some
problems, if we want to handle real texts
in syntactic analysis.
In the first part I&apos;ll outline the
theoretical framework we work with. Then
I&apos;ll discuss for which purpose the use of
the notion obligatory has some advantages
and in the last part I&apos;ll show shortly how
we intend to use this notion
- in lexical entries (with respect to
morphological analysis) and
- in the syntactic analysis process.

SOME THEORETICAL PREREQUISITES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999438290322581">
The basis of our work is a special
version of a dependency grammar (Kunze
1975). In this theory a syntactic
structure of a sentence is represented as
a tree, where the nodes correspond to the
wordforms of the sentence and the edges
express the dependencies between the word-
forms. The edges are marked by subordina-
tion relations (SR&apos;s) which describe the
relation between the subtree &amp;quot;under&amp;quot; the
edge and the remaining tree context.
Besides the syntactic dependencies
other connections between the wordforms of
the sentence remain which express certain
congruences and restrictions. Here we have
congruences - so-called paradigmatic
connections - like (the listed categories
concern the German variant):
from a noun to an attribute (gender,
number, case)
from a preposition to the noun (case)
from the subject to the finite verb
(number, person)
and restrictions - selective connections -
like:
from the verb to the (deep) subject
from the verb to the direct object etc.
The selective connections also apply to
all transformational variants of the
concerned phenomenon (let us take the
SUBJ-connection):

(7) John, der em n Buch liest,...
(John who reads a book,...)
It is easy to see that the tree
property would be destroyed if these
connections were included as edges in the
tree. To save the tree property Kunze
introduced the mechanism of paths of
action for the paradigmatic and selective
connections. These paths run along the
edges, i.e. they can be expressed also by
the subordination relations. This is one
essential reason for differentiating the
SR&apos;s very strongly.
For instance, it is necessary to
differentiate between
- the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; direct object and the
direct object with subject role:
John reads a book.
I see John reading a book.
- an adjective as attribute and a
participle as attribute:
The new book ...
The reading John
- the subject in an active clause and the
subject in a passive clause:
John reads a book.
A book is read by John.
Besides the subordination relations
another central concept in Kunze&apos;s theory
are the bundles (see also Reimann, 1982).
A bundle is a substructure of a dependency
tree which contains exactly one top node
and all nodes directly subordinated to it
together with the edges between (and their
markings - the subordination relations).
The original idea was to use the bundles
as syntactic rules. For this purpose, the
bundle is regarded as a system of
conditions which have to be fulfilled by a
set of nodes to construct the structure
which the bundle prescribed.
But another possibility to use bundles
is the following: They can serve as
descriptions for the dominance behaviour
of wordforms (i.e. the surface form of
valency). In this way, the approach is
similar to other theories: In the lexical
entries of the wordforms there is a
pointer to the rules which can be applied
with the concerned wordform as top node.
Our approach goes farther in the
direction of dominance behaviour
descriptions. Having in mind that,
especially for nouns and verbs, the
dominance behaviour is a very complex one,
i.e. many different things can be sub-
ordinated to nouns and verbs: many of them
are optional, some of them stand in
certain relations to others, etc. Thus we
concentrate all these bundles by defining
another form of a bundle, which consists,
in general, of many simple bundles.
For instance:
Peter stiehlt.
Peter stiehlt em n Auto.
Peter stiehlt dem Bauern das Auto.
Peter stiehlt dem Bauern das Auto vom
Hof.
Peter stiehlt das Auto vom Hof.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.961311">
* Peter stiehlt vom Hof.
* Peter stiehlt dem Bauern.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990537225">
As we can see, only the subject is
obligatory (in the active sentence), but
the indirect object as well as the
directional circumstance are only used, if
the direct object belongs to the sentence.
These facts can be expressed by a logical
formula like this:
( SUBJ&amp;quot; v ( ( IOBJ DIR) DOBJ ) )
That means we represent the dominance
behaviour of wordforms by logical formulas
(in subordination relations) - we call
these formulas bundles. It is quite clear
that it is not so easy to use these
bundles as rules for syntactic analysis,
but to describe the dominance behaviour of
wordforms they seem to be quite
appropriate. I won&apos;t deal here with free
modifications (real adjuncts and other
peripheral elements), although they
belong, according to the theory, also to
the bundles. To handle them a special
mechanism is included in the analysis
procedure.
THE PHENOMENON OF OBLIGATORY COMPLEMENTS
In the valency theory obligatory
complements are normally regarded as
special parts of the concept of the verb.
On this level the notion &amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot; has
often been investigated. It is connected
with the classification &amp;quot;complement-
adjunct&amp;quot;, but there are also optional
complements and obligatory adjuncts.
For automatic processing this
classification is not sufficient:
H. Somers (1986) showed that a more
flexible classification lead to better
results, especially with respect to
machine translation. Somers referred also
to the problem that obligatory
complements can be &amp;quot;hidden- in the text:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.677599857142857">
- Ellipses and other phenomena lead to
omissions which are hard to handle.
- In modified syntactic constructions
(passive, nominalisations) complements
can be omitted regularly.
- In other constructions the complements
stand in quite different relations to
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982722625">
the form derived from a verb (the
phenomenon of control, attributive
participles etc.). In these cases the
complements have to be found by special
tools.
Concerning the examples in the first
paragraph regular omissions are possible
in (3), (4), (5) and (6) while the
</bodyText>

315
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.991303941176471">
sentences (2), (6) and (7) belong to the
third category. They all have to be
handled in syntactic analysis, but the
question arises: What is the advantage of
using the notion obligatory under the
named circumstances?
Obligatory in syntactic analysis
Normally we suppose that sentences to
be analysed are correct. But, if we
construct a set of bundles (with
obligatory edges), we are defining a set
of sentences which will never be complete.
If there are no obligatory edges, the
described set is better covering the set
of correct sentences. Only very simple
demands have to be regarded like the
necessity of the surface subject. In this
way a parsing system can work quite well.
In the SaarbrUcken MT-systems a
dictionary is used where all complements
are entered in a cumulative way without
the classification obligatory-optional or
other relations (Luckhardt, 1985).
But I think, the possibilities to
combine complements of verbs (and of
derived forms) and thus also the notion
obligatory can be very useful to solve
ambiguities and to distinguish different
meanings of a verb. By the way, also in
SaarbrUcken such mechanisms are used, but
only in the so-called semantic analysis
following the syntactic analysis.
To show the advantages I&apos;ll take the
following verbs as examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.917446666666667">
a) rechnen
(1) Er rechnet (die Aufgaben).
(He calculates (the exercices).)
(2) Er rechnet ihn zu seinen Freunden.
(He reckons him among his friends.)
(3) Er rechnet mit ihm.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998752909090909">
(He takes him into account.)
In the first case the direct object is
optional, but the prepositional objects in
both other cases as well as the direct
object in the second case are obligatory.
If not, the first sentence would have all
three meanings! Only the subject is not
important for the distinction of the
meanings, and it is not as obligatory as
the other complements, because it can be
omitted by passive transformation.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.972756076923077">
b) bestehen
(1) Es besteht Hoffnung.
(There is hope.)
(2) Er besteht die PrUfung.
(He passes the examination.)
(3) Die Fabrik besteht seit 3 Jahren.
(The factory has existed for ...)
(4) Er besteht auf seiner Meinung.
(He insists on his opinion.)
(5) Die Wand besteht aus Steinen.
(The wall consists of stones.)
(6) Das Wesen der Sache besteht darin,..
(The nature ... consists in ...)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993815">
Here in (1) and (3) the subject is
obligatory, but in (2) only the direct
object. In the other cases the
prepositional objects are obligatory, thus
the distinction of the different meanings
is possible without ambiguities.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.5485315">
c) erwarten
(1) Er erwartet Gaste.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.826555">
(He is waiting for guests.)
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.837852">
(2) Die Kinder erwarten (von den Eltern)
em n Geschenk.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906363636364">
(The children expect a gift (from
their parents).)
Because of the possibility to form a
passive sentence from (1), the subject is
not obligatory in this case. But in (2) it
is obligatory. Unfortunately the
distinctive complement with von is not
obligatory, thus the distinction of these
two meanings requires also to take into
consideration the selective properties of
the direct object.
The conclusion of this paragraph can be
that the classification in obligatory and
optional complements is only important in
a final stage of syntactic analysis to
support the distinction of different
meanings of wordforms (especially verbal
forms or forms derived from verbs). But
this distinction is very useful mainly
with respect to machine translation, as we
can see translating the different meanings
of the examples.

PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993625791666667">
As we have seen in the first paragraph
the bundles (i.e. the logical formulas)
have their place in the lexicon as
description of the dominance behaviour of
the wordforms. There is no problem, if a
wordform lexicon (with full forms) is
used. But in an extensive syntactic
analysis system a morphological analysis
has to be included.
Obligatory in the lexicon
For a morphological analysis (not only
an inflexion analysis) we need a lexicon
of bases and a lexicon of affixes. In the
lexicon of bases there must be a general
description of the grammatical properties
and with the affixes rules have to be
stated for calculating the properties of
the derived wordforms.
What does this mean for the description
of the dominance behaviour? To calculate
with the logical formulas seems to be not
very convenient.
Therefore the dominance component is
divided into two parts: The first one is a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998179">
316
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.926245457142857">
cumulative list of the subordination
relations and the second one contains the
bundles.
For the first part a splitting of the
subordination relations is advantageous.
The subordination relations are very
complex things consisting of different
kinds of information:
- usual ideas about syntactic parts of
sentences like subject, attribute, ...
- paths of action for selective
connections,
- paths of action for paradigmatic
connections,
- wordclass conditions etc.
The first two express the well-known
syntactic functions (SF&apos;s), the others
their appearances - so-called morpho-
syntactic relations (MSR&apos;s) - which are
only necessary to recognize the syntactic
functions. If a syntactic function is
recognized, the used morpho-syntactic
relation can be forgotten.
Thus this part of the dominance
component is a list of syntactic functions
which have pointers to the MSR&apos;s
expressing this syntactic function in case
of the concerned wordform (SF-MSR-list).
The rules for the derivations concern only
this list, i.e. only the MSR&apos;s under the
SF&apos;s can be changed. For instance:
rechnen
SF&apos;s MSR&apos;s
SUBJ N-1 noun in nominative case
DOBJ N-4 noun in accussative case
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.575062833333333">
ZU P-ZU preposition zu
MIT P-MIT preposition mit
or S-DASS daB-clause
or 1-ZU infinitive with zu
(S-DASS and 1-ZU only with
correlate)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9912605">
After the passive transformation we
have the following list:
SUBJ P-PRACT prepositional actor
DOBJ N-1 noun in nominative case
ZU see above
MIT see above
A nominalisation (die Rechnung) leads
to the following:
SUBJ N-2 noun in genitive case
or P-PRACT prepositional actor
DOBJ N-2 noun in genitive case
or P-VON preposition von
ZU see above
MIT see above
Thus the bundles are not concerned by
the rules connected with the derivations.
But the problem remains how to handle the
property &amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot; here. We have two
possibilities:
- Only those complements which are
obligatory in all derived forms are
marked by the sign OB. In this case,
the subject is not obligatory for many
verbs, especially for all transitive
verbs. Choosing this possibility, the
&amp;quot;surface obligateness&amp;quot; (e.g. of a
surface subject) has to be generated
during the process (depending on
derivation).
- All semantically obligatory complements
are marked by OB. Then changes have to
be performed during the analysis
process, too.
We intend to follow the first way. At
this point the question arises how to deal
with the omissions of the third category,
where the complements are not really
omitted, but have to be looked for at
other places within the sentence. That
means that these complements are not
connected with the verbal node by a direct
edge (downward), but - in our theory -
they are connected by a path of action for
the corresponding selective connection. In
this way it is possible to let these
complements be obligatory and to remark in
the SF-MSR-list that instead of a MSR a
path af action leads to the concerned
complement.
Thus the SF-MSR-list for the infinitive
reghnen will have the following form:
SUBJ via SUBJ-path of action
DOBJ N-4
ZU see above
MIT see above
As result of the discussion we have the
following formulas for the different
meanings of rechnen:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998144666666667">
(1) (SUBJ DOBJ)
(2) (SUBJ v (ZU A DOBJ)&amp;quot;16)
(3) (SUBJ v MIT°S)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998531315789474">
Obligatory in the analysis process
Finally I&apos;ll give a short survey of our
syntactic analysis system to show that the
bundles - and with them also the notion
obligatory - are used only in the very
final stage.
The first step of the procedure is a
sequential preanalysis (performed by an
ATN) which has the task to find the
segments of the sentence and the verbal
groups of each clause.
The second step is a local analysis
where only two nodes and the relations
between them are regarded. Here the SF-
MSR-lists are used to recognize the
possible syntactic functions.
But in the third step wrong readings
from the first two steps are filtered out
using the bundles, i.e. the logical
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99389">

<bodyText confidence="0.999938">
formulas, together with the selective
conditions (transported by the paths of
action). A side effect of this so-called
global bundle analysis is the selection of
the actual verbal meaning. Only here the
notion &amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot; is used.
To conclude this paper I&apos;ll emphasize
once more the problems which have to be
taken into consideration, if the notion
&amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot; is used for syntactic
analysis:
- The advantage of using such a concept
is the possibility to solve ambiguities
and to select actual meanings of word-
forms (especially verbal forms).
This is the reason why it shall bR used
only in a final stage of analysis.
- The different possibilities to omit
obligatory complements have to be
treated in an adequate way. Here
special procedures during morphological
analysis and the mechanism of selective
connections (paths of action) can help
to handle the regular cases. For other
omissions (in ellipses etc.) default
solutions are proposed.

For automatic processing this classification is not sufficient: H. Somers (1986) showed that a more flexible classification lead to better results, especially with respect to machine translation. Somers referred also to the problem that obligatory can be in the text: - Ellipses and other phenomena lead to omissions which are hard to handle. - In modified syntactic constructions (passive, nominalisations) complements can be omitted regularly. - In other constructions the complements stand in quite different relations to the form derived from a verb (the phenomenon of control, attributive participles etc.). In these cases the complements have to be found by special tools. Concerning the examples in the first paragraph regular omissions are possible in (3), (4), (5) and (6) while the 315 sentences (2), (6) and (7) belong to the third category. They all have to be handled in syntactic analysis, but the question arises: What is the advantage of using the notion obligatory under the named circumstances? Obligatory in syntactic analysis Normally we suppose that sentences to be analysed are correct. But, if we construct a set of bundles (with obligatory edges), we are defining a set of sentences which will never be complete. If there are no obligatory edges, the described set is better covering the set of correct sentences. Only very simple demands have to be regarded like the necessity of the surface subject. In this way a parsing system can work quite well. In the SaarbrUcken MT-systems a dictionary is used where all complements are entered in a cumulative way without the classification obligatory-optional or other relations (Luckhardt, 1985). But I think, the possibilities to combine complements of verbs (and of derived forms) and thus also the notion obligatory can be very useful to solve ambiguities and to distinguish different meanings of a verb. By the way, also in SaarbrUcken such mechanisms are used, but only in the so-called semantic analysis following the syntactic analysis. To show the advantages I&apos;ll take the following verbs as examples: a) rechnen (1) Er rechnet (die Aufgaben). (He calculates (the exercices).) (2) Er rechnet ihn zu seinen Freunden. (He reckons him among his friends.) (3) Er rechnet mit ihm. (He takes him into account.) In the first case the direct object is optional, but the prepositional objects in both other cases as well as the direct object in the second case are obligatory. If not, the first sentence would have all three meanings! Only the subject is not important for the distinction of the meanings, and it is not as obligatory as the other complements, because it can be omitted by passive transformation. b) bestehen (1) Es besteht Hoffnung. (There is hope.) (2) Er besteht die PrUfung. (He passes the examination.) (3) Die Fabrik besteht seit 3 Jahren. (The factory has existed for ...) (4) Er besteht auf seiner Meinung. (He insists on his opinion.) (5) Die Wand besteht aus Steinen. (The wall consists of stones.) (6) Das Wesen der Sache besteht darin,.. (The nature ... consists in ...) Here in (1) and (3) the subject is obligatory, but in (2) only the direct object. In the other cases the prepositional objects are obligatory, thus the distinction of the different meanings is possible without ambiguities. c) erwarten (1) Er erwartet Gaste. (He is waiting for guests.) (2) Die Kinder erwarten (von den Eltern) em n Geschenk. children expect a their parents).) Because of the possibility to form a passive sentence from (1), the subject is not obligatory in this case. But in (2) it is obligatory. Unfortunately the distinctive complement with von is not obligatory, thus the distinction of these two meanings requires also to take into consideration the selective properties of the direct object. The conclusion of this paragraph can be that the classification in obligatory and optional complements is only important in a final stage of syntactic analysis to support the distinction of different meanings of wordforms (especially verbal forms or forms derived from verbs). But this distinction is very useful mainly with respect to machine translation, as we can see translating the different meanings of the examples. PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS As we have seen in the first paragraph the bundles (i.e. the logical formulas) have their place in the lexicon as description of the dominance behaviour of the wordforms. There is no problem, if a wordform lexicon (with full forms) is used. But in an extensive syntactic analysis system a morphological analysis has to be included. Obligatory in the lexicon For a morphological analysis (not only an inflexion analysis) we need a lexicon of bases and a lexicon of affixes. In the of there must be general description of the grammatical properties and with the affixes rules have to be stated for calculating the properties of the derived wordforms. What does this mean for the description of the dominance behaviour? To calculate with the logical formulas seems to be not very convenient. Therefore the dominance component is divided into two parts: The first one is a 316 cumulative list of the subordination relations and the second one contains the bundles. For the first part a splitting of the subordination relations is advantageous. The subordination relations are very complex things consisting of different kinds of information: usual ideas about syntactic parts of sentences like subject, attribute, ... paths of action for selective connections, paths of action for paradigmatic connections, wordclass conditions etc. The first two express the well-known syntactic functions (SF&apos;s), the others their appearances so-called morphosyntactic relations (MSR&apos;s) which are only necessary to recognize the syntactic functions. If a syntactic function is recognized, the used morpho-syntactic relation can be forgotten. Thus this part of the dominance component is a list of syntactic functions which have pointers to the MSR&apos;s expressing this syntactic function in case of the concerned wordform (SF-MSR-list). The rules for the derivations concern only this list, i.e. only the MSR&apos;s under the SF&apos;s can be changed. For instance: rechnen SUBJ N-1 noun in nominative case DOBJ N-4 noun in accussative case ZU P-ZU preposition zu MIT P-MIT preposition mit or S-DASS daB-clause or 1-ZU infinitive with zu (S-DASS and 1-ZU only with correlate) After the passive transformation we have the following list: SUBJ P-PRACT prepositional actor DOBJ N-1 noun in nominative case ZU see above MIT see above A nominalisation (die Rechnung) leads to the following: SUBJ N-2 noun in genitive case or P-PRACT prepositional actor DOBJ N-2 noun in genitive case or P-VON preposition von ZU see above MIT see above Thus the bundles are not concerned by the rules connected with the derivations. But the problem remains how to handle the property &amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot; here. We have two possibilities: - Only those complements which are obligatory in all derived forms are marked by the sign OB. In this case, the subject is not obligatory for many verbs, especially for all transitive verbs. Choosing this possibility, the &amp;quot;surface obligateness&amp;quot; (e.g. of a surface subject) has to be generated during the process (depending on derivation). - All semantically obligatory complements are marked by OB. Then changes have to be performed during the analysis process, too. We intend to follow the first way. At this point the question arises how to deal with the omissions of the third category, where the complements are not really omitted, but have to be looked for at other places within the sentence. That means that these complements are not connected with the verbal node by a direct edge (downward), but in our theory they are connected by a path of action for the corresponding selective connection. In this way it is possible to let these complements be obligatory and to remark in the SF-MSR-list that instead of a MSR a path af action leads to the concerned complement. Thus the SF-MSR-list for the infinitive reghnen will have the following form: SUBJ via SUBJ-path of action DOBJ N-4 ZU see above MIT see above As result of the discussion we have the following formulas for the different of rechnen: (1) (SUBJ DOBJ) (SUBJ v (ZU (SUBJ v Obligatory in the analysis process Finally I&apos;ll give a short survey of our syntactic analysis system to show that the bundles and with them also the notion obligatory are used only in the very final stage. The first step of the procedure is a sequential preanalysis (performed by an ATN) which has the task to find the segments of the sentence and the verbal groups of each clause. The second step is a local analysis where only two nodes and the relations between them are regarded. Here the SF- MSR-lists are used to recognize the possible syntactic functions. But in the third step wrong readings from the first two steps are filtered out using the bundles, i.e. the logical 317 formulas, together with the selective conditions (transported by the paths of action). A side effect of this so-called global bundle analysis is the selection of the actual verbal meaning. Only here the notion &amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot; is used. To conclude this paper I&apos;ll emphasize once more the problems which have to be taken into consideration, if the notion &amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot; is used for syntactic analysis: - The advantage of using such a concept is the possibility to solve ambiguities and to select actual meanings of wordforms (especially verbal forms). This is the reason why it shall bR used only in a final stage of analysis. - The different possibilities to omit obligatory complements have to be treated in an adequate way. Here special procedures during morphological analysis and the mechanism of selective connections (paths of action) can help to handle the regular cases. For other omissions (in ellipses etc.) default solutions are proposed.</abstract>

I&apos;ll show that such an approach leads to some problems, if we want to handle real texts in syntactic analysis. In the first part I&apos;ll outline the theoretical framework we work with. Then I&apos;ll discuss for which purpose the use of the notion obligatory has some advantages and in the last part I&apos;ll show shortly how we intend to use this notion - in lexical entries (with respect to morphological analysis) and - in the syntactic analysis process. SOME THEORETICAL PREREQUISITES The basis of our work is a special version of a dependency grammar (Kunze 1975). In this theory a syntactic structure of a sentence is represented as a tree, where the nodes correspond to the wordforms of the sentence and the edges express the dependencies between the wordforms. The edges are marked by subordination relations (SR&apos;s) which describe the relation between the subtree &amp;quot;under&amp;quot; the edge and the remaining tree context. Besides the syntactic dependencies other connections between the wordforms of the sentence remain which express certain congruences and restrictions. Here we have congruences - so-called paradigmatic connections - like (the listed categories conce</context>

But, if we construct a set of bundles (with obligatory edges), we are defining a set of sentences which will never be complete. If there are no obligatory edges, the described set is better covering the set of correct sentences. Only very simple demands have to be regarded like the necessity of the surface subject. In this way a parsing system can work quite well. In the SaarbrUcken MT-systems a dictionary is used where all complements are entered in a cumulative way without the classification obligatory-optional or other relations (Luckhardt, 1985). But I think, the possibilities to combine complements of verbs (and of derived forms) and thus also the notion obligatory can be very useful to solve ambiguities and to distinguish different meanings of a verb. By the way, also in SaarbrUcken such mechanisms are used, but only in the so-called semantic analysis following the syntactic analysis. To show the advantages I&apos;ll take the following verbs as examples: a) rechnen (1) Er rechnet (die Aufgaben). (He calculates (the exercices).) (2) Er rechnet ihn zu seinen Freunden. (He reckons him among his friends.) (3) Er rechnet mit ihm. (He takes h</context>

This is one essential reason for differentiating the SR&apos;s very strongly. For instance, it is necessary to differentiate between - the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; direct object and the direct object with subject role: John reads a book. I see John reading a book. - an adjective as attribute and a participle as attribute: The new book ... The reading John - the subject in an active clause and the subject in a passive clause: John reads a book. A book is read by John. Besides the subordination relations another central concept in Kunze&apos;s theory are the bundles (see also Reimann, 1982). A bundle is a substructure of a dependency tree which contains exactly one top node and all nodes directly subordinated to it together with the edges between (and their markings - the subordination relations). The original idea was to use the bundles as syntactic rules. For this purpose, the bundle is regarded as a system of conditions which have to be fulfilled by a set of nodes to construct the structure which the bundle prescribed. But another possibility to use bundles is the following: They can serve as descriptions for the dominance behaviour of wordforms (i.e. the surface form of vale</context>

To handle them a special mechanism is included in the analysis procedure. THE PHENOMENON OF OBLIGATORY COMPLEMENTS In the valency theory obligatory complements are normally regarded as special parts of the concept of the verb. On this level the notion &amp;quot;obligatory&amp;quot; has often been investigated. It is connected with the classification &amp;quot;complementadjunct&amp;quot;, but there are also optional complements and obligatory adjuncts. For automatic processing this classification is not sufficient: H. Somers (1986) showed that a more flexible classification lead to better results, especially with respect to machine translation. Somers referred also to the problem that obligatory complements can be &amp;quot;hidden- in the text: - Ellipses and other phenomena lead to omissions which are hard to handle. - In modified syntactic constructions (passive, nominalisations) complements can be omitted regularly. - In other constructions the complements stand in quite different relations to the form derived from a verb (the phenomenon of control, attributive participles etc.). In these cases the complements have to be foun</context>
