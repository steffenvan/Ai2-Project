This work extends the study of Germann et al.
(2010) in investigating the lexical organization
of verbs. Particularly, we look at the influence
of frequency on the process of lexical acquisi-
tion and use. We examine data obtained from
psycholinguistic action naming tasks per-
formed by children and adults (speakers of
Brazilian Portuguese), and analyze some cha-
racteristics of the verbs used by each group in
terms of similarity of content, using Jaccard&apos;s
coefficient, and of topology, using graph
theory. The experiments suggest that younger
children tend to use more frequent verbs than
adults to describe events in the world.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989595285714286">
The cognitive influence of frequency has been
proven strong in the learning process of both
sense and nonsense words (Howes and Solomon,
1951; Solomon and Postman, 1952). Frequency
has also been shown to highly correlate with se-
mantic factors, endorsing its importance, through
the so called “light verbs” (Goldberg, 1999).
In this study, we investigate whether words
that are more frequent have a higher chance of
earlier acquisition. For this purpose, we com-
pare data from children and adults, native speak-
ers of Brazilian Portuguese, on an action naming
task, looking at lexical evolution, using statistical
and topological analysis of the data modeled as
graphs. Our approach innovates in the sense that
it directly simulates the influence of a linguistic
factor over the process of lexical evolution.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2
describes related work. Section 3 presents the
materials and methods employed. Section 4
presents the results and section 5 concludes.

Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005), use some prop-
erties of language networks to propose a model
of semantic growth, which is compatible with the
effects of age of acquisition and frequency, in
semantic processing tasks. The approach pro-
posed in this paper follows Steyvers and Tenen-
baum in the sense of iterative modifications of
graphs, but differs in method (we use involutions
instead of evolutions) and objective: modifica-
tions are motivated by the study of frequency
instead of production of a topological arrange-
ment. It also follows Deyne and Storms (2008),
in directly relating linguistic factors and graph
theory metrics, and Coronges et al. (2007), in
comparing networks of different populations.
This study also follows Tonietto et al. (2008)
in using data from a psycholinguistic action nam-
ing task. However, the analysis is done in terms
of graph manipulation, instead of pure statistics.

The action naming task was performed by differ-
ent age groups: 55 children and 55 young adults.
Children&apos;s data are longitudinal; participants of
the first data collection (G1) aged between 2;0
and 3;11 (average 3;1), and in the second collec-
tion (G2), between 4;1 and 6;6 (average 5;5) as
described by Tonietto et al. (2008). The adult
group is unrelated to the children, and aged be-
tween 17;0 and 34;0 (average 21;8). Participants
were shown 17 actions of destruction or division
(Tonietto et al, 2008) and asked to describe it.

Data processing and justification of the chosen
domain are described in Germann et al. (2010).
The answers given by each participant were
collected and annotated with two frequency
scores, each calculated from a different source.
The first, Fscore, is the number of occurrences of
the verb in the “Florianópolis” corpus (Scliar-
Cabral, 1993; MacWhinney, 2000). The second,
Yscore, is the number of given results searching
for the infinitive form of the verb in the “Ya-
hoo!&amp;quot; Searcher (http://br.yahoo.com). In the ad-
vanced settings, “Brazil” was selected as country
and “Portuguese” as language. Information about
these two scores for each group is shown in Ta-
ble 1.

Linguistic production of each group was ex-
pressed in terms of graphs, whose nodes
represent the mentioned verbs. All verbs uttered
for the same video were assumed share semantic
information, and then linked together, forming a
(clique) subgraph. The subgraphs were then con-
nected in a merging step, through the words ut-
tered for more than one video.
To investigate the influence of frequency on
the language acquisition process, we used it to
change the network over time. Network involu-
tion, the strategy adopted, works in the opposite
way than network growth (Albert and Barabási,
2002). Instead of adding nodes, it takes an older
group graph as the source and decides on the
nodes to iteratively remove (taking the younger
group graph only as a reference for comparison).
Verbs were ranked in increasing order of fre-
quency. At each step of graph involution, the less
frequent verb was selected to be removed, and
1 Given the measure magnitude, values of Yscore were pre-
sented without the decimal fraction.
the resulting graph was measured. Results are
reported in terms of the averages of 10-fold
cross-validation (because ties imply in random
selection).
Graph theory metrics were used to measure
structural similarity: average minimal path length
(L), density (D), average node connectivity (k)
and average clustering coefficient (C/s)2. In the
involution, k and D, measure semantic share,
since that is what relations among nodes are sup-
posed to mean (see above). L and C/s are in-
tended to measure vocabulary uniformity, since
greater distances and lower clusterization are
related to the presence of subcenters of meaning.
In order to compare the contents of each graph
as well, we employed a measure of set similarity:
Jaccard&apos;s similarity coefficient (Jaccard, 1901).
Given two sets A and B, the Jaccard&apos;s coefficient
J can be calculated as follows:
,
where “Y” is the number of elements in both A
and B, “y” is the number of elements only in A,
and “z” is the number of elements only in B.

As we remove the verbs with lower frequency
from the graph of an older group, the overall
structure should approximate to that of a younger
group, and both should get more similar concern-
ing content. Therefore, the most relevant part of
each chart is the begging: the first removed verbs
are expected to be those that differentiate graphs.

The graph theory metrics are shown in Figures 1
and 2 in terms of 2 lines: network involution (a)
by using the selected criterion, and (b) by using
random selection (10-fold cross validation). In
addition, each figure also shows the measure for
the younger group as reference (a dashed,
straight, thick line).
In Figure 1, columns represent a graph theory
metric, and rows represent the use of a different
score. Each legend refers to all charts.
The results for the simulations from G2 to G1,
(Figure 1) show that the four metrics are clearly
distinct from random elimination from the be-
ginning, indicating that frequency plays a role in
the process. C/s is particularly distinct from ran-

Strogatz (1998), but as the graphs may become discon-

divided by the number of disconnected subgraphs.

dom: while the former remains constant almost
to the end, indicating a highly structured (clus-
tered) graph, the later shows effects of graph par-
titioning. The remaining metrics presented their
greatest approximations to the reference line be-
fore the middle of the chart, suggesting that the
initial verbs were actually the ones differentiat-
ing both graphs. These results suggest an initial
increase in semantic share, as k and D increase,
and in uniformity, as nodes get closer to one
another (L) and remain clustered (C/s). In Figure
2, the same tendencies are maintained, although
not as clearly as the previous results. The great-
est approximations of k and D happen in the first
half of the chart, but in a smoother way. C/s still
behaves steadily, remaining stable during most
of the simulation. Yscore resembles Fscore (the
same way as in Figure 1), and was not presented
due to space restrictions.

In the Jaccard&apos;s coefficient charts, a rise or stabi-
lization
tabilization means that “different verbs” (present
only in the older graph) were eliminated (in-
creasing set similarity), and a descent means that
“common verbs” (present in both graphs) were
eliminated instead.
Charts for “excluded different” and “excluded
common” verbs (and their random counterparts)
are presented in percentage. By doing so, it is
possible to measure the exact evolution of both,
despite the proportion between them (there are
much more “common” than “different” verbs). A
rise in the “Excluded Different” line means that
sets are getting similar, while stabilization (des-
cents are not possible) means that they are get-
ting different. The opposite applies to the “Ex-
cluded Common” line.
In the figures, charts are arranged in columns
(the score being used) and rows (the parameter
being measured). Each legend is particular to
each row (one to Jaccard&apos;s coefficient and anoth-
er to the excluded verbs).
Both simulation sets (Figures 3 and 4) confirm
the expected pattern in general: an initial in-
crease in the proportion between &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; and
“common” verbs. In Figure 3, Yscore presents an
unexpected descent just before the middle, fol-
lowed by a sharp rise. Since the greatest descent
happens just in the end, we interpret this middle
descent as data noise. In Figure 4, Fscore
presents an almost random result, indicating that

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995411">
This study has investigated the influence of fre-
quency on verb acquisition and organization us-
ing both graph and set theory metrics. In general,
results from the topological analysis showed a
tendency towards the reference value, and the
greatest similarities were mostly collected in the
beginning, pointing for a preference of children
to use verbs more frequently perceived in the
language. So we conclude that both the model of
involution and the given analysis are appropriate
for linguistic studies concerning vocabulary evo-
lution3.
3 Since the measures were taken from the whole graph, it is
not possible to determine a measure of significance. How-
ever, the comparisons with random elimination can be seen
For future work, we intend to apply the same
approach to other parameters, such as concrete-
ness, and syntactic complexity (and combina-
tions, and to investigate lexical dissolution in the
context of pathologies, such as Alzheimer&apos;s dis-
ease, and in larger data sets, in order to further
confirm the results obtained so far.

In the involution, k and D, measure semantic share, since that is what relations among nodes are supposed to mean (see above). L and C/s are intended to measure vocabulary uniformity, since greater distances and lower clusterization are related to the presence of subcenters of meaning. In order to compare the contents of each graph as well, we employed a measure of set similarity: Jaccard&apos;s similarity coefficient (Jaccard, 1901). Given two sets A and B, the Jaccard&apos;s coefficient J can be calculated as follows: , where “Y” is the number of elements in both A and B, “y” is the number of elements only in A, and “z” is the number of elements only in B. 4 Simulation Results As we remove the verbs with lower frequency from the graph of an older group, the overall structure should approximate to that of a younger group, and both should get more similar concerning content. Therefore, the most relevant part of each chart is the begging: the first removed verbs are expected to be those that differentiate graphs. 4.1 Network In</context>

The approach proposed in this paper follows Steyvers and Tenenbaum in the sense of iterative modifications of graphs, but differs in method (we use involutions instead of evolutions) and objective: modifications are motivated by the study of frequency instead of production of a topological arrangement. It also follows Deyne and Storms (2008), in directly relating linguistic factors and graph theory metrics, and</context>

In Figure 1, columns represent a graph theory metric, and rows represent the use of a different score. Each legend refers to all charts. The results for the simulations from G2 to G1, (Figure 1) show that the four metrics are clearly distinct from random elimination from the beginning, indicating that frequency plays a role in the process.
