The goal of this work is to study how to generate various kinds of anaphora in Chinese, including
zero, pronominal, and nominal anaphora, from the syntactic and semantic representation of
multisentential text. In this research we confine ourselves to descriptive texts. We examine the
occurrence of anaphora in human-generated text and those generated by a hypothetical computer
equipped with anaphor generation rules, assuming that the computer can generate the same
texts as the human except that anaphora are generated by the rules. A sequence of rules using
independently motivated linguistic constraints is developed until the results obtained are close
to those in the real texts. The best rule obtained for the choice of anaphor type makes use of
the following conditions: locality between anaphor and antecedent, syntactic constraints on zero
anaphora, discourse segment structures, salience of objects and animacy of objects. We further
establish a rule for choosing descriptions i f a nominal anaphor is decided on. We have implemented
the above rules in a Chinese natural language generation system that is able to generate descriptive
texts. We sent some generated texts to a number of native speakers of Chinese and compared
human-created results and computer-generated text to investigate the quality of the generated
anaphora. The results of the comparison show that the rules are fairly effective in dealing with
the generation of anaphora in Chinese.

The field of natural language generation has made a great deal of progress in the gen-
eration of multisentential text in recent years (McKeown 1985; Maybury 1990; Dale
1992; Hovy 1993). Most of the well-known systems first select and organize the mes-
sage contents to be generated and then map the organized results into a sequence
of surface sentences. When mapping into the surface form, the selection of appropri-
ate forms for anaphora is very important to make the generated text a cohesive unit
(McDonald 1980; Dale 1992). In this paper, our goal is the computer generation of
anaphora in Chinese.
In Chinese, anaphora can be classified as zero, pronominal, and nominal forms,
as exemplified in (1) by 011, tal &apos;he&apos; and nage ren&apos; that person&apos;, respectively (Chen
1987).1 Zero anaphora are generally noun phrases that are understood from the context
and do not need to be specified. In contrast, in this paper, we use the term nonzero

This research starts with establishing possible rules for the generation of anaphora
in Chinese. Previous work suggests obtaining these rules from consulting the results of
linguistic study, including general principles, such as the Gricean maxims (Grice 1975)
used in (Dale and Haddock 1991; Reiter and Dale 1992; Dale 1992) and focus theory,
as used in (Dale 1992). A shortcoming of previous work is that it is unclear to what
extent the resulting rules are effective in dealing with the generation of anaphora. In
an attempt to overcome this, we adopt an empirical approach to obtaining rules based
on observations of real texts.
The basic methodology used is to start with a set of human-generated Chinese
texts and the simplest possible anaphor generation rule (a rule that only considers
the locality of anaphora). We then progressively add extra tests to the rule, based on
independently motivated but simple linguistic principles. At each stage, we conduct
experiments that compare the anaphora occurring in the human-generated text with
those in the texts that would be generated by a computer taking the same syntactic
and semantic content as the human texts and generating Chinese anaphora according
to the rule being tested (this has to be simulated by hand). This process continues
until a rule with promising performance on the data is obtained. The objective is thus
to answer the question of how complex a rule must be to account for the complexity
of anaphor generation exhibited by the test data.
This paper presents one sequence of rules developed using the above methodology
and evaluates the effectiveness of the new linguistic principles taken into account at
each point. At present, we have chosen only one intuitively plausible way to generate
increasingly complex rules, with refinements introduced as they occurred to us (though
not motivated by the data). Clearly the work could and should be extended to consider
all possible combinations of the principles in all possible orders.
Except where noted below, the preselected Chinese data serves as an independent
test of the effectiveness of the different rules, which are based on principles that have
been independently suggested in the literature. However, the fact that the chosen data
determine the termination condition for the development means that the rules could be
overfitting the chosen data. Therefore a selection of the rules have been implemented
in a Chinese natural language generation system and their results are further evaluated
by means of an experiment using native speakers.
This paper concentrates on the use of zero, pronominal, and nominal anaphora
in Chinese generated text. We are not concerned with lexical anaphora (Tutin and
Kittredge 1992) where the anaphor and its antecedent share meaning components,

while the anaphor belongs to an open lexical class. For example, flower can be used as
a lexical anaphor for rose (Tutin and Kittredge 1992).
In Sections 2 to 3.3, we establish the rules for the generation of anaphora in Chi-
nese. We consider the case of zero anaphora (Section 2) first, followed by nonzero
anaphora (Section 3), which divides into pronouns (Section 3.1) and nominal anaphora
(Sections 3.2 and 3.3). Next, in Section 4, we describe the implementation of the gen-
eration rules in our Chinese generation system and show the result of evaluating the
anaphora in the text generated by systems employing different rules. Finally, Section 5
presents the conclusions.

Initially we consider simply the decision of whether a generated anaphor should be a

<bodyText confidence="0.999374666666667">
Although there are no clear rules delineated in previous linguistic work, we, neverthe-
less, can summarize a very simple rule, Rule 1 as shown below and in an associated
decision tree in Figure 1, for the generation of zero anaphora.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.79219">

If an entity, e, in the current clause was referred to in the immediately preceding clause,
then a zero anaphor is used for e; otherwise, a nonzero anaphor is used.
This is clearly a very simple rule, but it is interesting to see how well it performs.
We now describe an experiment comparing the anaphora generated by a hypothetical
computer employing this rule and those occurring in real text to see how well it works.
The same basic format is used for subsequent experiments on more refined rules.
In this paper, the selected texts are restricted to the exposition type, which explain
an idea or discuss a problem. Three sets of articles consisting of scientific questions
and answers written by multiple authors, and an introduction to Chinese grammar,
are selected as the test data (more details can be found in Yeh [1995J). In this data,
there are 490 zero pronouns, 116 pronouns, and 703 nominal anaphora, making a total

of 1,309 anaphora. The experiment is executed in three steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.918820846153846">
1. Zero and nonzero anaphora within the selected texts are identified.&apos;
2. Each anaphor is given values according to the conditions in the current
rule. For example, for Rule 1, an anaphor is determined to be immediate
if its antecedent occurs in the immediately preceding clause; otherwise it
is long-distance. We can then classify the anaphora corresponding to the
decision tree of the rule, as in Figure 1. In the figure, Z and NZ denote
zero and nonzero anaphora, respectively. Later we will use P and N to
distinguish between pronouns and nominal anaphora.&apos;
3. We assume that a hypothetical computer employing the current rule can
generate the same text as the test data except for the anaphora, which
are determined by the rule to be tested. We simulate this computer by
hand and note down the difference between the anaphora generated by
the computer and those in the test data.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951473684211">
In step 3, we categorize the differences between the results as: matched, over-
generated and under-generated types. If a reference created by the simulated com-
puter is the same as the one in the real text, then it belongs to the matched type.
If a zero anaphor is created by the hypothetical computer, while the corresponding
position in the real text is a nonzero anaphor, then it belongs to the overgenerated
type. Conversely, if a zero anaphor is found in some position in the real text, while
a nonzero anaphor is created by the computer, then it belongs to the undergenerated
type.
From the classification tree, the number of the matched type is the total number
of zero and nonzero anaphora associated with zero and nonzero leaf nodes in the
classification tree. The over- and under-generated types are counted as the numbers
of nonzero and zero anaphora associated with zero and nonzero leaf nodes in the
tree. The result of using Rule 1 on the test data is shown in Figure 1. In the table,
the matched rate of the test data is 66%, which obviously shows an unpromising
performance of the computer employing Rule 1. Apparently, what we need to do is
to find more constraints to enhance Rule 1. As shown in the classification trees of the
test data, the numbers of nonzeros are far greater than their counterparts, zeros, in
the long-distance cases of anaphora. Thus, in the following, we will not make any
refinement to the long-distance cases because little progress would be obtained.

2.2 Rule 2: Adding Syntactic Constraints
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9967238">
Li and Thompson (1979, 1981) formulated a negative rule stating that zero anaphora
are not allowed in certain syntactic positions regardless of discourse factors: the NP
right after a coverb, and the pivotal NP in a serial verb construction. Therefore, we
enhanced Rule 1 by adding the above syntactic constraints on zero anaphora, which
becomes Rule 2, as shown in Figure 2.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.998627">
2 This is not necessarily a trivial task, as of course there is no physical evidence for zero anaphora in
text. Indeed, there is some question as to whether the notion of zero pronoun is the best way of
accounting for the syntactic facts about languages such as Chinese. Since we are looking at things from
a generation perspective, we have considered a zero pronoun to occur when an important semantic
element is not overtly specified in the text. In practice, this criterion probably produces similar results
to approaches considering verb subcategorization (Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994).
3 Note that we only deal with third person pronouns in Chinese; thus, in the table, and the following,
pronominal anaphora, or pronouns, refer to third person cases. In this paper, we treat the first and
second person pronouns as nominal anaphora.

If an entity, e, in the current clause was referred to in the immediately preceding clause
and does not violate any syntactic constraint on zero anaphora, then a zero anaphor

We then established for each anaphor in the test data whether a zero anaphor
in this position would violate these syntactic constraints or not and obtained a new
classification tree, as shown in Figure 2. The matched rate of Rule 2 is 80%, as shown in
the same figure. Though Rule 2 improves its predecessor&apos;s performance, the result still
discourages us from using it for the generation of zero anaphora in Chinese. As shown
in Li and Thompson (1979) and Frosz and Sidner (1986), the structure of discourse is a
significant factor affecting the use of anaphoric forms. Thus, we employed the notion
of discourse structure as the basis for enhancing the rule.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.496928">
2.3 Rule 3: Adding Discourse Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970322">
Grosz and Sidner (1986) suggest that three structures can be identified within a dis-
course: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state. The first struc-
ture is the sequence of utterances that comprise the discourse. Underlying this is the
intentional structure, which shows the relationship between the respective purposes of
discourse segments. An important idea in the theory is the effect of the linguistic ex-
pressions in utterances constituting the discourse and the discourse segment structure
on each other. On the one hand, linguistic expressions can be used to convey informa-
tion about the discourse segment structure. On the other hand, the discourse segment
structure constrains the interpretation of linguistic expressions. What concerns us here
is the interrelationship between the forms of referring expressions and the discourse
segment structures.
Li and Thompson (1979) propose the idea that the use of nonzero anaphora has
to do with the segment boundaries in a discourse. A zero anaphor used to refer to
some entity in the previous clause might be expected to indicate the continuation
of a discourse segment, while a nonzero anaphor occurring in the same situation

signals a boundary of a discourse segment. From the generator&apos;s perspective, when
the decision about the anaphoric form for a phrase referring to some entity in the
previous utterance is to be made, the factor of discourse segment boundaries must be
taken into consideration. Therefore, based on this idea, we improve the previous rules
for generation of zero anaphora, to make Rule 3, as shown in Figure 3.
Rule 3
If an entity, e, in the current clause was referred to in the immediately preceding
clause, does not violate any syntactic constraint on zero anaphora, and is not at the
beginning of a discourse segment, then a zero anaphor is used for e; otherwise, a
nonzero anaphor is used.
To determine the applicability of the new constraint to each anaphor, we had to
access the discourse segment structures of the test data. Therefore, we annotated the
boundaries between discourse segments in the test data and the hierarchical discourse
structures, by hand, according to perceived discourse segment intentions. Since our
annotations were based on intuition, we tested them by comparing them with those
of other native speakers of Chinese to see whether our intuitions about the discourse
structures of the test data were reliable for the purpose of the experiments. In the test,
four native speakers of Chinese were asked to annotate discourse segment boundaries
for five articles selected from the test data. Each speaker was given a short description
in Chinese (see the Appendix) about the idea of discourse structure and the task to be
done, namely, annotate the discourse segment boundaries according to the intentions
of the discourse segments. The speakers reached a good level of agreement among
themselves (obtaining a value of 0.76 for the kappa statistic [Siegel and Castellan 19881)

and adding our own annotations to the pool resulted in a similar level of agreement
(kappa = 0.764). On average, 89% of our annotation markers match those of the speak-
ers. From the above comparison, we judged that the annotations we made were highly
reliable for the purpose of the experiment. The result also shows that the sentential
marks in the test data closely correlate to the boundaries between discourse segments.
In Chinese written text, a sentential mark, &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;, is normally inserted at the end of a &amp;quot;sen-
tence,&amp;quot; which is a meaning-complete unit in a discourse; on the other hand, commas
are inserted between clauses within a &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; as separators (Liu 1984).4 A Chinese
discourse, say a paragraph of written text, therefore consists of a sequence of &amp;quot;sen-
tences&amp;quot; and the corresponding intentions altogether form the intention of the discourse.
The classification trees and results of the experiment are shown in Figure 3. By
taking into account the effect of discourse segment structure, we obtained 93% matches
in the test data. The result shows that Rule 3 is helpful for the decision as to whether
to use a zero anaphor.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999152">
2.4 Rule 4: Adding Topic Continuity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981482758621">
Although the zero anaphora generated using Rule 3 look considerably similar to those
in the test data, there are, nevertheless, still a number of overgenerations for the test
data. Tai (1978), Li and Thompson (1979), and Chen (1984, 1986), have noticed that
zero anaphora frequently occur in topic chains where a referent is referred to in the
first clause, and then several more clauses follow talking about the same referent (the
topic), but with it omitted; (lb) in Section 1 is an example. Here, we use the feature
of topic-prominence in Chinese (Li and Thompson 1981) to further refine the previous
rule.
In Chinese, the topic of a sentence is what the sentence is about and always
comes first in the sentence; the rest of the sentence is comment upon the topic (Li
and Thompson 1981). The topic is always either definite (refers to something that the
reader already knows about), or generic (refers to a class of entities). The subject of a
sentence, on the other hand, is the NP that has a &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; relationship with
the verb in the sentence. By distinguishing between topics and subjects in sentences, we
have the following types of sentences: sentences with both subject and topic, sentences
in which the subject and topic are identical, sentences with no subjects, and sentences
with no topic (Li and Thompson 1981). A sentence without a topic is used to introduce
a new entity into the discourse. In the remaining types of sentences, the topic can be
found at the beginning of the sentence.
The basic idea here is to investigate the positions of the antecedent and the anaphor
in their respective clauses. Then we observe the occurrence of both the antecedent
and anaphor in the topic position to see the effect of topic on zero anaphora. In the
following, we divided the position of anaphora in their respective utterances into topic
and nontopic cases.
For each anaphor, its antecedent&apos;s position is classified as either topic or direct
object. Thus we have the types of antecedent-anaphor pairs shown in Figure 4. Since
in the new rule the condition of topic continuity in clause will be considered to refine
the zero leaf node in the decision tree of Rule 3, we focus on investigating the cor-
responding anaphora in the classification trees. The numbers of the various types of

antecedent-anaphor pairs in the test data, according to this classification, are shown
in Figure 4.
Obviously, for columns A and B in the table, nonzero cases, namely the sums of
pronouns and nominals, are in the minority of the test data. Chen (1987) found a higher
percentage of zero anaphora occurring in the topic position with their antecedent most
frequently in the topic or object positions of the immediately previous clause, which
strongly supports the idea of letting anaphora of Types A and B be zero. Zero anaphora
of Types A and B are generally understood because they are salient (Li and Thompson
1981). Anaphora of Types C to F are not as salient as Types A and B; thus we group
Types C to F as nonsalient. The total number of zero cases for the nonsalient type is
17(4%) in the test data; the total number of nonzeros for the same type is 40(63%).
Thus we let anaphora of the nonsalient type be nonzero. By letting Types A and B be
zero, and others be nonzero, we obtained a new rule, Rule 4.

The decision tree and classification tree are shown in Figure 5.
The result in the same figure shows that the matched rate increased from 93% to
94%. Note that, although the new material in Rule 4 was motivated by the prior work of
Chen and others, the exact form of the new constraint was formulated after considering
the distribution of anaphora in the data, which means that an improvement (on this
data) was almost inevitable.

in general. A simple way to refine the previous anaphor generation rule is to let the
nonzero parts in the rule be nominal. The decision tree and classification tree can then
be obtained from Figure 5 by changing all nonzeroes (NZs) into nominals (Ns).
To demonstrate the result of using the new decision tree, we extended the defi-
nition of matched, overgenerated and undergenerated types used previously for zero
and nonzero anaphora to zero, pronominal, and nominal anaphora. The number of
matched cases for zero, pronoun, and nominal in the test data can be obtained by sum-
ming up anaphora of the correct type associated with the leaf nodes labeled Z, P. and
N in the classification trees, respectively. The overgenerated cases of zero anaphora,
for instance, are the sum of nonzero anaphora associated with the leaf nodes labeled
Z in the classification trees. Conversely, the undergenerated cases of zero anaphora,
for instance, are the sum of zero anaphora associated with the leaf nodes labeled with
nonzeros. The overgenerated and undergenerated cases of pronouns and nominals can
be obtained in a similar way. The result from using full NPs for nominal anaphora
is shown in Table 1. Hereafter, we use overall matched to refer to the total number
of matched anaphora, across all the classes. The number of overall matched cases is
thus 1,132 (450 + 682), out of 1,309 anaphora in total. In general, we can convert this
to a percentage by dividing by the total number of anaphora. Thus the percentage of

overall matched cases is 86%. This rate looks quite promising; however, it does not
truly reflect the use of different nominal forms.
Li and Thompson (1979), and Chen (1986) showed that pronouns are frequently
used when the anaphora occur at places marked as minor discontinuities and when
referring to things that are highly noteworthy. The conditions of minor discontinuity
were not clearly stated, and individual judgements on this are likely to vary. Thus we
will not take it as a constraint to further refine our rule. As for the other discourse
factor, high noteworthiness, the condition of animacy noticed by Chen can be deter-
mined according to the features of the referent and hence is easily implementable.
In an examination of inanimate anaphora, Chen (1986) found that there were only a
few instances of pronouns; in other words, most pronominal anaphora are animate.
On the other hand, the percentage of inanimate anaphora being encoded in nominal
forms is higher than that of pronouns. Thus we employ the animacy of the referent
as a constraint to refine Rule 4 and obtain a new rule, Rule 5, as shown in Figure 6.
Rule 5
If an entity, e, in the current clause was referred to in the immediately preceding clause,
does not violate any syntactic constraint on zero anaphora, is not at the beginning of
a discourse segment, and is salient, then a zero anaphor is used for e; otherwise, a
nonzero anaphor is used. If a nonzero anaphor is animate, then it is pronominalized;
otherwise, it is nominalized
In general, animate objects characterize living things, especially animal life. We adopted
this concept to determine the animacy of anaphora. The result of using Rule 5 is shown
in the table of Figure 6. Although the increase in the overall matched rate was not
significant, 39% (45/116) of the pronouns in the test data, however, were matched by
using the new rule.

3.2 Full NP Descriptions

<bodyText confidence="0.9999846">
The surface structure of a Chinese nominal anaphor is a noun phrase that consists
of a head noun optionally preceded by associative phrase, articles, relative clauses,
and adjectives (Li and Thompson 1981). In Chinese, whether one chooses articles for
nominal descriptions depends on complicated factors (Teng 1975; Li and Thompson
1981). Observing the test data, we found that nominal anaphora are not commonly
marked with articles.&apos; Thus, we chose not to use articles for descriptions of nominal
anaphora in our system. The nominal descriptions investigated in the remainder of this
section are thought of as noun phrases of the above scheme without articles. Nominal
anaphora do not have unique forms as their zero and pronominal counterparts do.

initial reference can be removed, new information can be added to the initial reference,
or even a different lexical item can be used for a nominal anaphor. In this paper, we
focus on the first two cases. A nominal anaphor is referred to as a reduced form, or a
reduction, of the initial reference if its head noun is the same as the initial reference,
and its modification part is a strict subset of the optional part in the initial reference;
otherwise, if it is identical to the initial reference, then it is a full description.
We can classify nominal descriptions into the types shown in Figure 7. The break-
down of the matched nominal anaphora in the test data, in terms of the above clas:
sification, is shown in Table 2. Note that first and second person pronouns in the test

The figures in Table 2 show that full descriptions, namely, Types Bare and Full,
are frequently used for nominal anaphora. Thus we first choose full descriptions for
all N&apos;s. As shown in Table 2, there are 556 (471 + 85) full descriptions used among
682 matched nominal anaphora. Thus the overall matched rate becomes 77%, if we
take different descriptions of nominal anaphora into account. Obviously this shows
that the choice of full NP for nonzeros is not promising. In the next subsection, we
improve this by considering the use of reduced and full descriptions.

3.3 Reduced Descriptions within Segments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989">
Previous work on the generation of referring expressions focused on producing mini-
mal distinguishing descriptions (Dale and Haddock 1991; Dale 1992; Reiter and Dale
1992) or descriptions customized for different levels of hearers (Reiter 1990). Since
we are not concerned with the generation of descriptions for different levels of users,
we look only at the former group of work, which aims at generating descriptions for
a subsequent reference to distinguish it from the set of entities with which it might
be confused. The main data structure in these algorithms is a context set, which is
the set of entities the hearer is currently assumed to be attending to, except the in-
tended referent. Minimal distinguishing descriptions pursue efficiency in producing
an adequate description that can identity the intended referent unambiguously with
a given context set. Dale (1992) used the global focus space (Grosz and Sidner 1986),
as the context set in his domain of small discourse. Following this idea, the context
set grows as the discourse proceeds. Consider, for example, two nominal anaphora
referring to the same entity occurring at different places in a discourse. According to
the above algorithms, a single description would be produced for both anaphora if the
context sets at both places contain the same elements. On the other hand, in general,
a description with more distinguishing information is used for the second anaphor if
distractors have entered into the context set. Two entities are said to be distractors to

each other if they are of the same category. For example, the black dog and the brown dog
are distractors to each other because they are of the same category, dog. The entity, the
big cat, is not a distractor to the black dog because it is of different category, cat.
Grosz and Sidner (1986) claim that discourse segmentation is an important factor,
though obviously not the only one, governing the use of referring expressions. If the
idea of context set were restricted to local focus space (Grosz and Sidner 1986), then the
resulting descriptions would be to some extent sensitive to local aspects of discourse
structure. Although the algorithms would be refined due to the introduction of more
discourse structure, they would essentially still serve the purpose of distinguishing
potential referents.
The beginnings of discourse segments, in a sense, indicate shifts of intention in a
discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986). In this situation, it may be preferred that subsequent
references be full descriptions rather than reduced ones or pronouns, to emphasize the
beginning of discourse segments, even if the referents have just been mentioned in
the immediately previous utterance. See Grosz and Sidner (1986) and Dale (1992) for
some examples that illustrate this idea. Figure 8 indicates that a similar situation may
happen in Chinese discourse.
Among the groups of initial and subsequent references, we focus on the one in-
dexed j, la fengzheng de xian &apos;the string pulling the kite&apos;. After it is initially introduced
in (b), it then appears in zero and nominal forms alternatively in the rest of the dis-
course, as shown schematically in Figure 9. At the beginning of the second &amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot;
it appears in a full description and then in four reduced descriptions in the rest of the
&amp;quot;sentence.&amp;quot;6 It is not mentioned in the third &amp;quot;sentence.&amp;quot; When it is reintroduced into
the fourth &amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot; it appears in another full noun phrase, piao zai kongzhong de xian
&apos;the string fluttering in the sky,&apos; which is not reduced. Then, in the last &amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot; it
repeats the same patterns as in the second &amp;quot;sentence.&amp;quot; Since there are no distracting
elements for the string in the discourse, the use of full descriptions at the beginning
of &amp;quot;sentences,&amp;quot; (e) and (g), can be interpreted as emphasizing that a new discourse
segment, &amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot; has begun. The accompanying reduced descriptions can then be
explained as being intended to contrast with the emphasis at the beginning of &amp;quot;sen-
tences.&amp;quot; Note that a full description is used for the subsequent reference in (p) that is
not at the beginning of a &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; because it is the first mention in the &amp;quot;sentence.&amp;quot;
Thus, we would generalize the above interpretation to be that a full description is
preferred for a subsequent reference if it is at the beginning of a &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; or the first
mention in the &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot;; otherwise, a reduced description is preferred.
Should distracting elements occur in a &amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot; a sufficiently distinguishable
description is required for a subsequent reference within the &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; instead of a
reduced one, even if it has been mentioned previously in the &amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot; for example,

In this section, we briefly describe the implementation of the rules in our Chinese
natural language generation system. We then present an evaluation of the anaphora

</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999416">
4.1 Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975967741935">
The rules obtained in the previous sections have been implemented in the referring
expression component of our Chinese natural language generation system (Yeh 1995)
that generates paragraph-sized texts for describing the plants, animals, etc., in a na-
tional park. Basically, the main goal of our work is to generate coherent texts by taking
advantage of various forms of anaphora in Chinese. The system, like conventional ones
(McKeown 1985; Maybury 1990; Dale 1992; Hovy 1993), is divided into strategic and
tactical components. Since we do not aim at inventing new concepts in content plan-
ning, we borrow the idea of text planning in Maybury&apos;s TEXPLAN system (Maybury
1990) as the basis of the strategic component. As for the tactical component, we have
constructed a simple Chinese grammar in the PATR formalism (Shieber 1986), which
is sufficient for our purpose at the current stage.
On accepting an input goal from the user, the system invokes the text planner
according to the operators in the plan library to build a hierarchical discourse struc-
ture that satisfies the input goal. After the text planning is finished, the decision of
anaphoric forms and descriptions is then carried out by traversing the plan tree. Within
the traversal, when a reference is met, if it is a subsequent one, then the program con-
sults Rule 5 to obtain a form: zero, pronominal, or nominal. If the nominal form is
chosen, then the preference rule is consulted to get a description.
In the domain knowledge base, each entity, in addition to the information for the
head noun in the surface form, is accompanied by a property list that will be realized in
the modification part of the surface noun phrase for the initial reference. We build up
the semantic structure of an initial reference by taking all the elements in the property
list, along with the substance of the entity, corresponding to the head noun in the
surface noun phrase. To simplify the work, for the moment, only one element is stored
in the property list. When a full description is chosen for a subsequent reference, its
semantic structure contains the same property and substance information as the initial
reference. On the other hand, if a reduced description is decided on, only the substance
is taken into the semantic structure. In the future, we will extend the property list by
allowing multiple elements in the list.
The tests of locality, syntactic constraints, and salience are straightforward to im-
plement because the system has complete knowledge of the discourse to be generated

and its syntactic structure. Only the tests of discourse structure and animacy are dif-
ficult, and for these we have had to approximate what a more sophisticated system
might be able to do. Currently, we examine the decomposition field of a planning
operator by hand to determine &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; boundaries and fix this for all applications
of the operator. Thus we assume that there is a distinguished level of structure in
a discourse plan that is relevant for this purpose (this may be expressible in terms
of Maybury&apos;s distinction between rhetorical acts and speech acts). For the animacy
constraint, we have had to determine by hand whether each individual object in our
domain is likely to be treated as animate or not.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998682">
4.2 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841375">
The linguistic principles embodied in our rules were all independently proposed, so
in some respects the previous data served as both training and test data in the devel-
opment of the rules. Furthermore, the assumed contextual information, for example,
discourse structures, may be difficult to access in a real implementation. Thus, the
performance of a real anaphor generation algorithm based on the rules proposed here
may be different from the experimental results we obtained. In this section, we attempt
a post-evaluation by asking some native speakers of Chinese to judge the quality of
the anaphora generated by a real system based on the rules.
Evaluation is becoming an increasingly important issue for natural language gen-
eration systems (Meteer and McDonald 1991), though, unfortunately, there are still no
generally accepted methods. In this work, we were particularly concerned to find a
method of evaluation that reflected directly on the anaphor generation of the system
(unlike &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; evaluation of the kind we had done before [Levine and Mellish
1995]). We were also wary of asking human subjects to estimate the &amp;quot;readability&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;coherence&amp;quot; of texts (though this seemed to work well for Acker and Porter [1994]). In
this evaluation, we chose three Chinese natural language generation systems to com-
pare. Each system is assumed to have the same system components, as described in
Section 4.1, except that the referring expression component of each system is equipped
with a different anaphor generation rule. Given an input to a test system, anaphora
in the resulting texts will be determined by the rule used in the referring expression
component of the system. The rules, TRi, i = 1, ,3, used in the test systems are
shown in Figure 10. TR/ corresponds to our Rule 2, together with an animacy test
to distinguish between pronouns and nominal anaphora. TR2 adds the constraint on
discourse structure and TR3 adds to this the salience constraint (and is the same as
Rule 5). The intention was to test a range of rules and hence get an indication of how
much better (if at all) the more sophisticated rules are than the simpler ones.
The evaluation task can be divided into an annotation stage and a comparison
stage. In the annotation stage, each of 12 native speakers of Chinese is given five test
sheets corresponding to five texts generated by our generation system. The numbers
of clauses in the texts are 5, 12, 12, 21, and 34; the numbers of anaphora in the texts
are 4, 11, 11, 20, and 34.
Each anaphor position in a generated text was left empty and all candidate forms
of the anaphor, including zero, pronominal, and full and reduced descriptions were
put under the empty space. The speaker was asked to annotate which form he or
she preferred for each anaphor position on the test sheets. After the annotations were
collected, we compared the speakers&apos; results with the generated texts to investigate
the performance of the test rules. In each comparison, we noted down the number of
matches between the computer-generated text and the human result. This approach
is the same as that used in Knight and Chander (1994) for the problem of article
generation, except that in our case we had to use generated, rather than naturally

This average matching rate, however, is lower than the matching rates we obtained
in the empirical studies described previously. The problem is partly because the test
texts used in the former comparison are human-created, while the test texts used here
are computer-generated. The grammatical structures of the computer-generated texts
are simplified; they are not as sophisticated as human texts. When asked to decide
their preferences for anaphora in the computer-generated texts, speakers may find
the information shown in the test texts less complete than what they are used to in
creating their own texts and hence it may be difficult for them to make decisions. In
the empirical study, the human-created texts perhaps provided enough information
for the hypothetical computer to decide on an appropriate anaphoric form.
A more important reason why the matching rates are lower with speakers than
with the hypothetical computer may be that in some circumstances, more than one
solution may be acceptable and the speakers may not always choose the same one as
the computer. This hypothesis can be investigated by looking at the extent to which
the speakers agree among themselves.
To see how the speakers agree among themselves, we compared speakers&apos; anno-
tations. The comparison result is shown in Table 5. For each speaker, the number for
each test text is the average of matches with the other eleven speakers. At the end of
the table are the average numbers for the speakers&apos; agreement among themselves. The
figures in the table show that the speakers do not achieve agreement among them-
selves for the use of anaphora in this test. These figures are further supported by the
use of the kappa statistic. The overall kappa value for all speakers is about 0.41, which
represents only &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot; agreement. The measure of agreement gets worse if only
the zero/ pronoun/ nominal distinction is considered or if zero and nonzero pronouns
are lumped together. Only two speakers agree with one another with a kappa value
of more than 0.7 (none with a value of greater than 0.8). The speakers as a whole
agreed with kappa greater than 0.7 on only 30 out of the 80 anaphora, with complete
agreement only 14 times. To get an overall agreement of greater than 0.8 would require
reducing the set of speakers from 12 to a carefully selected 3.
Since all systems produce the same result on Text 1, unsurprisingly they all have
the same matching rate, as shown in Table 4. Text 2 contains three topic shifts that
would make the rule containing the salience constraint, TR3, obtain different output

from those without this constraint. TR/ and TR2 produce the same output and hence
they obtain the same matching rate, 70%. TR3 obtains higher matching rates than the
other two, 79%, which shows the effectiveness of the salience constraint in it.
Another middle-sized test text, Text 3, is broken into three &amp;quot;sentences&amp;quot; and con-
tains three topic shifts. The constraints on discourse segment beginnings in TR2 and
TR3 and the salience constraint in TR3 would therefore have some effects on the out-
put texts. The matching rate, as shown in Table 4, increases from 62% to 66% for TR2,
which shows that the constraint on discourse segment beginnings in TR2 is effective.
TR3 obtains a 65% matching rate, on average, which is 1% lower than its predecessor
TR2. However, this decrease in average matching rate does not negate the effectiveness
of the salience constraint in TR3. TR2&apos;s text differs from TR3&apos;s in the three topic shifts:
TR2 generates zero anaphora for these shifts, while TR3 generates full descriptions.
The speakers varied greatly in choosing anaphoric forms for these topic shifts: among
12 speakers, 4 chose all full descriptions, 3 used all zero anaphora, and the other 5
chose zero, pronominal, and nominal anaphora. Thus, 4 of the 12 speakers completely
agree with TR3, while 3 agree with TR2. This shows that the salience constraint in
TR3 is still effective.
Next, we examine the more complicated texts, Texts 4 and 5. As shown in Table 4,
the increases in matching rates show the effectiveness of the constraint on discourse
segments beginning in TR2. Again, the average matching rates of TR3 are sightly lower
than TR2 for these two texts. However, similar to the situation in Text 3, the speakers
have varied agreement on the choice of anaphora for the topic shiftings in these two
texts. For Text 4, 3 speakers completely agree with TR2 and 1 speaker agrees with TR3.
As for Text 5, 2 speakers completely agree with TR2, while the others partly agree with
TR2 and TR3.
The discussions above show that the salience constraint in TR3 is sometimes effec-
tive in getting small improvements in the output texts. In brief, the more sophisticated
constraints a rule contains, the better it performs. Both TR2 and TR3 perform better
than TR1. TR3 performs better than TR2 for texts with simple discourse segment struc-
ture. For the texts having complicated discourse segment structures, TR2 is slightly
better than TR3 on average matching rates. Adding the results of the rules to those
of the speakers leads to a slight decrease in kappa for TR/ but progressively better
(though only from 0.41 to 0.43) values for kappa for TR2 and TR3. This indicates that
the better rules seem to disagree with the speakers no more than the speakers disagree
among themselves. There are nine anaphora where the kappa score including TR3 is
less than that for the speakers alone (in many other cases, the results are better). These
seem to involve places where the speakers were more willing to use a zero pronoun
(where the system used a reduced nominal anaphor) and where the speakers reduced
nominal anaphora less than the system did.

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823">
In this paper, we present empirical work on the generation of anaphora in Chinese.
The initial set of results suggests that most anaphora, including zero anaphora, and
full and reduced descriptions for nominal anaphora, can be effectively generated by a
rule using simple syntactic, semantic, and discourse constraints. The results obtained
from an implementation of this rule, however, correlated less well with human per-
formance. It is hard to determine the reason for this, though the problems of reliably
implementing all the constraints, presenting the anaphora within natural-looking texts
and, above all, coping with the disagreements between native speakers, all probably
make a contribution.

The factors affecting the use of pronouns are very complicated; thus it is difficult
to get computable rules. Introducing the constraint of animacy of objects in the rule
can resolve part of the problem. We do not handle the generation of long-distance
pronouns, which were rare in our texts. A possible solution would be to employ the
concept of stacked focus space in Grosz and Sidner&apos;s discourse structure theory (Grosz
and Sidner 1986; Dale 1992).
In the final rule, the implementation of the test of the beginning of a discourse
segment is not quite as straightforward as the other constraints. In our current imple-
mentation, we rely on the hierarchical structure of the message content to be generated
as the basis for dividing the message into segments, which is effective in improving
the texts generated by our Chinese natural language generation system. The evalua-
tion result also shows that the rule using all constraints collected from the empirical
study performs better than one with simpler constraints.
In the future, this work needs to be further developed to deal with anaphora in
other types of texts and the use of connectives in generated text to create cohesive
discourse. In addition the constraints for pronominal anaphora could be improved,
and the implementation extended to satisfy other types of applications.

Appendix: Instructions for Discourse Segmentation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998885444444444">
The instructions for discourse segmentation, given in Chinese, are as follows:
Description: There are five articles to be examined in this investiga-
tion. Each article is accompanied by a question-style topic. The content
of an article is to answer the question accompanying it. Therefore the
purpose (or intention) of the whole article is obviously to answer its
own question. Reading carefully, you will find that an article can be di-
vided into a string of segments according to their respective purposes
(or intentions). Let&apos;s call each of them a subpurpose (or subintention).
Therefore the purpose (or intention) of an article is obviously com-
posed of a string of subpurposes (or subintentions). In other words,
every subpurpose (subintention) serves as a part of the whole inten-
tion of an article. Furthermore, in an article, a subpurpose (or subin-
tention) can be a subsidiary of other subpurposes (or subintentions),
just like subpurposes (subintentions) are subsidiaries of the whole in-
tention. That is, a subpurpose can subsume others. Therefore, we have
a hierarchical intentional structure for an article,
Task: After thoroughly understanding the above description, for each
article, complete the following tasks:

<abstract confidence="0.98827825">The goal of this work is to study how to generate various kinds of anaphora in Chinese, including zero, pronominal, and nominal anaphora, from the syntactic and semantic representation of multisentential text. In this research we confine ourselves to descriptive texts. We examine the occurrence of anaphora in human-generated text and those generated by a hypothetical computer equipped with anaphor generation rules, assuming that the computer can generate the same texts as the human except that anaphora are generated by the rules. A sequence of rules using independently motivated linguistic constraints is developed until the results obtained are close to those in the real texts. The best rule obtained for the choice of anaphor type makes use of the following conditions: locality between anaphor and antecedent, syntactic constraints on zero anaphora, discourse segment structures, salience of objects and animacy of objects. We further establish a rule for choosing descriptions i f a nominal anaphor is decided on. We have implemented the above rules in a Chinese natural language generation system that is able to generate descriptive texts. We sent some generated texts to a number of native speakers of Chinese and compared human-created results and computer-generated text to investigate the quality of the generated anaphora. The results of the comparison show that the rules are fairly effective in dealing with the generation of anaphora in Chinese.</abstract>

The classification trees and results of the experiment are shown in Figure 3. By taking into account the effect of discourse segment structure, we obtained 93% matches in the test data. The result shows that Rule 3 is helpful for the decision as to whether to use a zero anaphor. 2.4 Rule 4: Adding Topic Continuity Although the zero anaphora generated using Rule 3 look considerably similar to those in the test data, there are, nevertheless, still a number of overgenerations for the test data. Tai (1978), Li and Thompson (1979), and Chen (1984, 1986), have noticed that zero anaphora frequently occur in topic chains where a referent is referred to in the first clause, and then several more clauses follow talking about the same referent (the topic), but with it omitted; (lb) in Section 1 is an example. Here, we use the feature of topic-prominence in Chinese (Li and Thompson 1981) to further refine the previous rule. In Chinese, the topic of a sentence is what the sentence is about and always comes first in the sentence; the rest of the sentence is comment upon the topic (Li and Thompson 1981). The topic is always either definite (ref</context>

This rate looks quite promising; however, it does not truly reflect the use of different nominal forms. Li and Thompson (1979), and Chen (1986) showed that pronouns are frequently used when the anaphora occur at places marked as minor discontinuities and when referring to things that are highly noteworthy. The conditions of minor discontinuity were not clearly stated, and individual judgements on this are likely to vary. Thus we will not take it as a constraint to further refine our rule. As for the other discourse factor, high noteworthiness, the condition of animacy noticed by Chen can be determined according to the features of the referent and hence is easily implementable.

Anaphora of Types C to F are not as salient as Types A and B; thus we group Types C to F as nonsalient.

Introduction The field of natural language generation has made a great deal of progress in the generation of multisentential text in recent years (McKeown 1985; Maybury 1990; Dale 1992; Hovy 1993). Most of the well-known systems first select and organize the message contents to be generated and then map the organized results into a sequence of surface sentences. When mapping into the surface form, the selection of appropriate forms for anaphora is very important to make the generated text a cohesive unit (McDonald 1980; Dale 1992). In this paper, our goal is the computer generation of anaphora in Chinese. In Chinese, anaphora can be classified as zero, pronominal, and nominal forms, as exemplified in (1) by 011, tal &apos;he&apos; and nage ren&apos; that person&apos;, respectively (Chen 1987).</context>

In an attempt to overcome this, we adopt an empirical approach to obtaining rules based on observations of real texts. The basic methodology used is to start with a set of human-generated Chinese texts and the simplest possible anaphor generation rule (a rule that only considers the locality of anaphora).

Thus the overall matched rate becomes 77%, if we take different descriptions of nominal anaphora into account. Obviously this shows that the choice of full NP for nonzeros is not promising. In the next subsection, we improve this by considering the use of reduced and full descriptions. 3.3 Reduced Descriptions within Segments Previous work on the generation of referring expressions focused on producing minimal distinguishing descriptions (Dale and Haddock 1991; Dale 1992; Reiter and Dale 1992) or descriptions customized for different levels of hearers (Reiter 1990). Since we are not concerned with the generation of descriptions for different levels of users, we look only at the former group of work, which aims at generating descriptions for a subsequent reference to distinguish it from the set of entities with which it might be confused.

Although the algorithms would be refined due to the introduction of more discourse structure, they would essentially still serve the purpose of distinguishing potential referents. The beginnings of discourse segments, in a sense, indicate shifts of intention in a discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986). In this situation, it may be preferred that subsequent references be full descriptions rather than reduced ones or pronouns, to emphasize the beginning of discourse segments, even if the referents have just been mentioned in the immediately previous utterance. See Grosz and Sidner (1986) and Dale (1992) for some examples that illustrate this idea. Figure 8 indicates that a similar situation may happen in Chinese discourse. Among the groups of initial and subsequent references, we focus on the one indexed j, la fengzheng de xian &apos;the string pulling the kite&apos;. After it is initially introduced in (b), it then appears in zero and nominal forms alternatively in the rest of the discourse, as shown schematically in Figure 9.

We then present an evaluation of the anaphora in some texts generated by our system. 4.1 Implementation The rules obtained in the previous sections have been implemented in the referring expression component of our Chinese natural language generation system (Yeh 1995) that generates paragraph-sized texts for describing the plants, animals, etc., in a national park. Basically, the main goal of our work is to generate coherent texts by taking advantage of various forms of anaphora in Chinese. The system, like conventional ones (McKeown 1985; Maybury 1990; Dale 1992; Hovy 1993), is divided into strategic and tactical components. Since we do not aim at inventing new concepts in content planning, we borrow the idea of text planning in Maybury&apos;s TEXPLAN system (Maybury 1990) as the basis of the strategic component. As for the tactical component, we have constructed a simple Chinese grammar in the PATR formalism (Shieber 1986), which is sufficient for our purpose at the current stage.

Thus, we employed the notion of discourse structure as the basis for enhancing the rule. 2.3 Rule 3: Adding Discourse Structure Grosz and Sidner (1986) suggest that three structures can be identified within a discourse: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state. The first structure is the sequence of utterances that comprise the discourse. Underlying this is the intentional structure, which shows the relationship between the respective purposes of discourse segments. An important idea in the theory is the effect of the linguistic expressions in utterances constituting the discourse and the discourse segment structure on each other.

Minimal distinguishing descriptions pursue efficiency in producing an adequate description that can identity the intended referent unambiguously with a given context set. Dale (1992) used the global focus space (Grosz and Sidner 1986), as the context set in his domain of small discourse. Following this idea, the context set grows as the discourse proceeds. Consider, for example, two nominal anaphora referring to the same entity occurring at different places in a discourse. According to the above algorithms, a single description would be produced for both anaphora if the context sets at both places contain the same elements. On the other hand, in general, a description with more distinguishing information is used for the second anaphor if distractors have entered into the context set.

We sent some generated texts to a number of native speakers of Chinese and compared human-created results and computer-generated text to investigate the quality of the generated anaphora. The results of the comparison show that the rules are fairly effective in dealing with the generation of anaphora in Chinese. 1. Introduction The field of natural language generation has made a great deal of progress in the generation of multisentential text in recent years (McKeown 1985; Maybury 1990; Dale 1992; Hovy 1993). Most of the well-known systems first select and organize the message contents to be generated and then map the organized results into a sequence of surface sentences. When mapping into the surface form, the selection of appropriate forms for anaphora is very important to make the generated text a cohesive unit (McDonald 1980; Dale 1992). In this paper, our goal is the computer generation of anaphora in Chinese.

In this section, we attempt a post-evaluation by asking some native speakers of Chinese to judge the quality of the anaphora generated by a real system based on the rules. Evaluation is becoming an increasingly important issue for natural language generation systems (Meteer and McDonald 1991), though, unfortunately, there are still no generally accepted methods. In this work, we were particularly concerned to find a method of evaluation that reflected directly on the anaphor generation of the system (unlike &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; evaluation of the kind we had done before [Levine and Mellish 1995]). We were also wary of asking human subjects to estimate the &amp;quot;readability&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;coherence&amp;quot; of texts (though this seemed to work well for Acker and Porter [1994]). In this evaluation, we chose three Chinese natural language generation systems to compare. Each system is assumed to have the same system components, as described in Section 4.1, except that the referring expression component of each system is equipped with a different anaphor generation rule.

In the table, the matched rate of the test data is 66%, which obviously shows an unpromising performance of the computer employing Rule 1. Apparently, what we need to do is to find more constraints to enhance Rule 1. As shown in the classification trees of the test data, the numbers of nonzeros are far greater than their counterparts, zeros, in the long-distance cases of anaphora. Thus, in the following, we will not make any refinement to the long-distance cases because little progress would be obtained. 2.2 Rule 2: Adding Syntactic Constraints Li and Thompson (1979, 1981) formulated a negative rule stating that zero anaphora are not allowed in certain syntactic positions regardless of discourse factors: the NP right after a coverb, and the pivotal NP in a serial verb construction. Therefore, we enhanced Rule 1 by adding the above syntactic constraints on zero anaphora, which becomes Rule 2, as shown in Figure 2. 2 This is not necessarily a trivial task, as of course there is no physical evidence for zero anaphora in text. Indeed, there is some question as to whether the notion of zero pronoun is the best way of accounting for the syntactic facts about l</context>

We then established for each anaphor in the test data whether a zero anaphor in this position would violate these syntactic constraints or not and obtained a new classification tree, as shown in Figure 2. The matched rate of Rule 2 is 80%, as shown in the same figure. Though Rule 2 improves its predecessor&apos;s performance, the result still discourages us from using it for the generation of zero anaphora in Chinese. As shown in Li and Thompson (1979) and Frosz and Sidner (1986), the structure of discourse is a significant factor affecting the use of anaphoric forms. Thus, we employed the notion of discourse structure as the basis for enhancing the rule. 2.3 Rule 3: Adding Discourse Structure Grosz and Sidner (1986) suggest that three structures can be identified within a discourse: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state.

The classification trees and results of the experiment are shown in Figure 3. By taking into account the effect of discourse segment structure, we obtained 93% matches in the test data. The result shows that Rule 3 is helpful for the decision as to whether to use a zero anaphor. 2.4 Rule 4: Adding Topic Continuity Although the zero anaphora generated using Rule 3 look considerably similar to those in the test data, there are, nevertheless, still a number of overgenerations for the test data. Tai (1978), Li and Thompson (1979), and Chen (1984, 1986), have noticed that zero anaphora frequently occur in topic chains where a referent is referred to in the first clause, and then several more clauses follow talking about the same referent (the topic), but with it omitted; (lb) in Section 1 is an example. Here, we use the feature of topic-prominence in Chinese (Li and Thompson 1981) to further refine the previous rule. In Chinese, the topic of a sentence is what the sentence is about and always comes first in the sentence; the rest of the sentence is comment upon the topic (Li and Thompson 1981). The topic is always eith</context>

The number of overall matched cases is thus 1,132 (450 + 682), out of 1,309 anaphora in total. In general, we can convert this to a percentage by dividing by the total number of anaphora. Thus the percentage of 177 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 Table 1 Result of choosing full NP NZ in Rule 4.

This rate looks quite promising; however, it does not truly reflect the use of different nominal forms. Li and Thompson (1979), and Chen (1986) showed that pronouns are frequently used when the anaphora occur at places marked as minor discontinuities and when referring to things that are highly noteworthy. The conditions of minor discontinuity were not clearly stated, and individual judgements on this are likely to vary. Thus we will not take it as a constraint to further refine our rule. As for the other discourse factor, high noteworthiness, the condition of animacy noticed by Chen can be determined according to the features of the referent and hence is easily implementable.

Tai (1978), Li and Thompson (1979), and Chen (1984, 1986), have noticed that zero anaphora frequently occur in topic chains where a referent is referred to in the first clause, and then several more clauses follow talking about the same referent (the topic), but with it omitted; (lb) in Section 1 is an example. Here, we use the feature of topic-prominence in Chinese (Li and Thompson 1981) to further refine the previous rule. In Chinese, the topic of a sentence is what the sentence is about and always comes first in the sentence; the rest of the sentence is comment upon the topic (Li and Thompson 1981). The topic is always either definite (refers to something that the reader already knows about), or generic (refers to a class of entities). The subject of a sentence, on the other hand, is the NP that has a &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; relationship with the verb in the sentence. By distinguishing between topics and subjects in sentences, we have the following types of sentences: sentences </context>

Obviously, for columns A and B in the table, nonzero cases, namely the sums of pronouns and nominals, are in the minority of the test data. Chen (1987) found a higher percentage of zero anaphora occurring in the topic position with their antecedent most frequently in the topic or object positions of the immediately previous clause, which strongly supports the idea of letting anaphora of Types A and B be zero. Zero anaphora of Types A and B are generally understood because they are salient (Li and Thompson 1981). Anaphora of Types C to F are not as salient as Types A and B; thus we group Types C to F as nonsalient. The total number of zero cases for the nonsalient type is 17(4%) in the test data; the total number of nonzeros for the same type is 40(63%). Thus we let anaphora of the nonsalient type be nonzero. By letting Types A and B be zero, and others be nonzero, we obtained a new rule, Rule 4. Rule 4 If an entity, e, in the current clause was referred to in the immediately preceding clause, does not violate any syntactic constraint on zero anaphora, is not at the beginning of a discourse segment, </context>

Although the increase in the overall matched rate was not significant, 39% (45/116) of the pronouns in the test data, however, were matched by using the new rule. 3.2 Full NP Descriptions The surface structure of a Chinese nominal anaphor is a noun phrase that consists of a head noun optionally preceded by associative phrase, articles, relative clauses, and adjectives (Li and Thompson 1981). In Chinese, whether one chooses articles for nominal descriptions depends on complicated factors (Teng 1975; Li and Thompson 1981).

On average, 89% of our annotation markers match those of the speakers. From the above comparison, we judged that the annotations we made were highly reliable for the purpose of the experiment. The result also shows that the sentential marks in the test data closely correlate to the boundaries between discourse segments. In Chinese written text, a sentential mark, &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;, is normally inserted at the end of a &amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot; which is a meaning-complete unit in a discourse; on the other hand, commas are inserted between clauses within a &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; as separators (Liu 1984).4 A Chinese discourse, say a paragraph of written text, therefore consists of a sequence of &amp;quot;sentences&amp;quot; and the corresponding intentions altogether form the intention of the discourse. The classification trees and results of the experiment are shown in Figure 3. By taking into account the effect of discourse segment structure, we obtained 93% matches in the test data.

Furthermore, the assumed contextual information, for example, discourse structures, may be difficult to access in a real implementation. Thus, the performance of a real anaphor generation algorithm based on the rules proposed here may be different from the experimental results we obtained. In this section, we attempt a post-evaluation by asking some native speakers of Chinese to judge the quality of the anaphora generated by a real system based on the rules. Evaluation is becoming an increasingly important issue for natural language generation systems (Meteer and McDonald 1991), though, unfortunately, there are still no generally accepted methods. In this work, we were particularly concerned to find a method of evaluation that reflected directly on the anaphor generation of the system (unlike &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; evaluation of the kind we had done before [Levine and Mellish 1995]). We were also wary of asking human subjects to estimate the &amp;quot;readability&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;coherence&amp;quot; of texts (though this seemed to work well for Acker and Porter [1994]). In this evaluation, we chose three Chinese natural language generation systems to compare. Each system is assumed to have the same system </context>

A shortcoming of previous work is that it is unclear to what extent the resulting rules are effective in dealing with the generation of anaphora. In an attempt to overcome this, we adopt an empirical approach to obtaining rules based on observations of real texts.

We are not concerned with lexical anaphora (Tutin and Kittredge 1992) where the anaphor and its antecedent share meaning components, 170 Yeh and Mellish An Empirical Study on Anaphora Z=490 P=116 N=703 locality? lo a ity? immediat long immediate long Z= 74 Z=16 NZ P=I03 P=13 N=329 N=374 NZ Matched Overgenerated Undergenerated Total 861 (66%) 432 (33%) 16 (1%) 1,309 Figure 1 Decision tree, classification tree, and result for Rule 1. while the anaphor belongs to an open lexical class. For example, flower can be used as a lexical anaphor for rose (Tutin and Kittredge 1992). In Sections 2 to 3.3, we establish the rules for the generation of anaphora in Chinese. We </context>

Observing the test data, we found that nominal anaphora are not commonly marked with articles.&apos; Thus, we chose not to use articles for descriptions of nominal anaphora in our system. The nominal descriptions investigated in the remainder of this section are thought of as noun phrases of the above scheme without articles. Nominal anaphora do not have unique forms as their zero and pronominal counterparts do. The description can be the same as the initial reference, parts of the information in the 5 See Yeh (1995) for detailed descriptions. 178 Yeh and Mellish An Empirical Study on Anaphora Z=490 P=116 N=703 lo arty? immediat ong Z=474 Z=I6 P=103 P=13 .

A nominal anaphor is referred to as a reduced form, or a reduction, of the initial reference if its head noun is the same as the initial reference, and its modification part is a strict subset of the optional</context>

Both figures show that the preference rule is promising in the choice of full or reduced descriptions for nominal anaphora. 4. Implementation and Evaluation Result In this section, we briefly describe the implementation of the rules in our Chinese natural language generation system. We then present an evaluation of the anaphora in some texts generated by our system. 4.1 Implementation The rules obtained in the previous sections have been implemented in the referring expression component of our Chinese natural language generation system (Yeh 1995) that generates paragraph-sized texts for describing the plants, animals, etc., in a national park. Basically, the main goal of our work is to generate coherent texts by taking advantage of various forms of anaphora in Chinese. The system, like conventional ones (McKeown 1985; Maybury 1990; Dale 1992; Hovy 1993), is divided into strategic and tactical components. Since we do not aim at inventing new concepts in content planning, we borrow the idea of text planning in Maybury&apos;s TEXPLAN system (Maybury 1990) as the basis of the strategic component. As for the tactical component, we have construc</context>
