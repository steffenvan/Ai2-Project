Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999822923076923">
A proposal to deal with French tenses in the frame-
work of Discourse Representation Theory is pre-
sented, as it has been implemented for a fragment
at the IMS. It is based on the theory of tenses of
H. Kamp and Ch. Rohrer.
Instead of using operators to express the
meaning of the tenses the Reichenbachian point of
view is adopted and refined such that the impact of
the tenses with respect to the meaning of the text
is understood as contribution to the integration of
the events of a sentence in the event structure of
the preceeding text. Thereby a system of relevant
times provided by the preceeding text and by the
temporal adverbials of the sentence being processed
is used. This system consists of one or more ref-
erence times and temporal perspective times, the
speech time and the location time. The special in-
terest of our proposal is to establish a plausible
choice of &amp;quot;anchors&amp;quot; for the new event out of the
system of relevant times and to update this system
of temporal coordinates correctly. The problem of
choice is largely neglected in the literature. In op-
position to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the
exact meaning of the tenses is fixed by the resolu-
tion component and not in the process of syntactic
analysis.

ence time. In the original version these entities
are understood as time-points. In the sequel fre-
quently this system was transformed into interval-
based approaches to describe the interaction of
adverbials, tenses and aspect on sentence level
(cf. v.Eynde(1987), Bras/Borillo(1988)) or to de-
scribe the course of events on text level (cf. Hin-
richs(1986), Partee(1984)1). A detailed criticism of
the Reichenbachian analysis of tenses can be found
in Bauerle(1979)). Motivated by text-phenomena
the Kamp/Rohrer approach (1983,1985) splits the
Reichenbachian reference time into three contextu-
ally given parameters by adding temporal perspec-
tive points and location times.
Our approach which is based on the
Kamp/Rohrer analysis differs from treatments of
the semantics of tenses (and aspects) which charac-
terize the tenses by some simple operator (usually
interpreted as a temporal quantifier) in that respect
that the tenses are described in terms of their con-
tribution to the problem of how the temporal struc-
ture of the events talked about can be constructed.
The problem how to determine the times the con-
text has to supply and to which the events have
to be related is largely neglected in theoretical dis-
cussions of the semantics of tenses. It is the main
topic of our discussion. Special attention has been
paid to the interaction of tense, aspect and tempo-
ral adverbials in determining these relations. The
approach represents a unified account of tense and
aspects. Another problem dealt with is the problem
of tense switch.
We will restrict the discussion to French
tenses prevailing in (written) reports about past
events (imparfait, passe simple, passe compose,
plusqueparfait, conditionnel). The tense system
1Partee has discussed at length the parallelism between
nominal and temporal anaphora. The idea of tenses as
anaphora, as developed there, underlies to a certain extent
our approach as well.

concerning the past, in contrast to that relating
to the present or future time, is rather elaborated,
especially in French. A proper theory of tenses has
to account for this multiplicity.

2 Representing events in
DRT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9214508">
In the framework of Discourse Representation The-
ory (DRT) (Kamp(1981)) a Discourse Representa-
tion Structure (DRS) is a pair &lt; U,K &gt; consisting
of a set U of discourse referents (DRFs) and a set
K of conditions. Discourse Referents are assumed
to be sorted according to the following sort sys-
tem (for our purposes only the temporal branch is
relevant):
all, a
temporal, t non-temporal, x
dynamic state, s
event, e process, p
We shall use the indicated letters for DRFs of
the corresponding sort2. Conditions take the fol-
lowing forms:

1. P(al , , an), where P is an n-ary predicate
symbol and the ai are discourse referents. Con-

notation.

Thus DRT uses a variant of the Davidsonian

<tableCaption confidence="0.890714142857143">
2For simplicity we will use the term event not just for the
corresponding subsort of dynamic but also for dynamic or
temporal objects in general. For the same reason we do not
make a clear distinction between &amp;quot;aspect&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Aktions-
arten&amp;quot;. The intended meaning should be clear from the
context. The classification is related to the one given in
Vendler(1967).

an event discourse referent is put before a DRS r

a recursive definition of aspects and to account f

DRSs containing conditions as these are embedd■
into models by mapping the temporal DRFs on
objects in a domain of temporal objects. A prop
embedding is realized if the value of the ever
DRF fulfills conditions represented by the sub-DI
which the event introduces with respect to an i
terpretation function defined among other thin
on predicates such as travel in the example aboN
An advantage of this representation on the cy
hand is that, following the usual definition of acct
sibility of DRSs from a DRS used in DRT, restri
tions on the accessibility of DRFs as possible a
tecedents for anaphoras can be expressed, thoul
for our purposes this will play only a subordina
role. On the other hand different modes of existen

The basic tenses of French narrative texts are it
parfait and passe simple. The interaction of the
tense forms is often described by two pairs of o
position: On the one hand the passe simple is un
to describe actions of the narrative, &amp;quot;the course
events&amp;quot;, whereas the imparfait serves to paint t]

background of the story. On the other hand the im-
parfait can be used to describe events in progress
as viewed from &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot;, whereas the passé simple
presents the event as a punctual entity. In order to
reflect these dichotomies we require that an event
introduced by passe simple serves as new reference
time which must not start before the old one, and
that the imparfait introduces a state which includes
temporally the existing reference time. In this case
no new reference time is created.
In the case of passe simple we do not require
that the new reference time has to follow com-
pletely the old one in order to deal correctly with
discourse situations as &apos;elaboration&apos; or &apos;contrast&apos;
and others. To discriminate such textual functions
an elaborate inference component is needed, which
at present is not available. In addition there are
cases where this inference component would need
information about the proceeding of the whole
story. This cannot be made available at this stage
of processing.
Thus an underspecified relation not-before is
necessary which can be defined, as other relations
like subset (needed for the imparfait), out of the re-
lations overlap and before, the only basic temporal
relations used in the systems.
The plusqueparfait can be understood as per-
fective state giving background information with
respect to the actual reference time of the story,
(Jean avait déjà mange), or as introducing or con-
tinuing a flashback.
The conditionnel is understood as a counter-
part to the plusqueparfait describing an anticipa-
tion with respect to a perspective point in the past.
We think that passé compose in (written)
narrative texts should be treated as analogue to
the passé simple with respect to pure temporal
relations4.
Temporal adverbials provide a location time
for events in relation to the temporal structure of
the preceding text. They can differ from each other
by their characterization of the location time and
their anaphoric behavior. Deictic adverbials like de-
main, la semaine derniere for instance create lo-
cation times of different temporal extension with
different ordering conditions regarding the evalu-
ation time (after and before), but they are simi-
lar in that the evaluation time must be the speech

time, whereas in case of le lendemain, la semaine
precidante the temporal relations and extensions
are equivalent to the deictic analogues but the time
of evaluation has to be a past reference time or per-
spective point. Frame-time adverbials like ce jour-
la can be distinguished from punctual time adver-
bials like a trois heures and from adverbials, like
puis, which simply state a temporal relation bet-
ween the event to be introduced and a temporal
antecedent. Some adverbials, like puis and ensuite,
do not restrict the nature of the antecedent, it is
just a reference time. But maintenant e.g. requires
that the evaluation time is a perspective point of
the text. The resolution component has to take into
account such phenomena.

4 Aspects of Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995353">
4.1 Architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984581352941176">
The construction of the semantic representa-
tion for a discourse proceeds in several stages:
each sentence is parsed using a Lexical Func-
tional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan/Bresnan(1982),
Eisele/DOrre(1986)) which analyzes sentences into
functional structures (f-structures), augmented by
indices to indicate the linear order of words in
the input string. The f-structure serves as input
for the construction of a proto-semantic represen-
tation (cf. Reyle(1985), Reinhardt/Kasper(1987)).
The last stage consists in integrating this represen-
tation into a semantic representation for the dis-
course, mainly by doing the necessary resolutions
for anaphoric expressions. Accordingly, the system
consists of three major modules:
LFG-Parser:

<bodyText confidence="0.999885678571429">
of the tenses in these modules. The inference ma-
chine and knowledge base are at present not imple-
mented. The proto-semantic representation for a
sentence built up by the Composer differs from the
semantic representation proper in that it not just
contains the semantic information available from
the sentence but also morpho-syntactic information
from the f-structure needed to constrain the resolu-
tion process. Thereby, this information is passed to
the Resolver which separates semantic and syntac-
tic information and uses it. What sort of morpho-
syntactic information is passed will be discussed
later.
The concept of resolution here is broader than
the usual one which comprises mainly determin-
ing the reference of anaphoric expressions like pro-
nouns. We use the term as covering all kinds of con-
text dependency beyond the single sentence level
where something in the sentence has to be related
to some entity in the preceding discourse. The term
temporal resolution will be used to refer to the pro-
cess of determining the temporal structure of the
events the discourse is about.
The Resolver is intended to implement good
heuristics based on purely linguistic knowledge.
The evaluation of the readings produced should be
left to the inference machine which also can access
non-linguistic world knowledge.

4.2 Temporal Features in the F-
Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.913674666666667">
In the Kamp/Rohrer system the tenses are ana-
lyzed by means of four features which have tempo-
ral and aspectual meaning:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99917625">
• PERFectivity,
• PRO Gressivity,
• TENSE,
• Temporal Perspective
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.958843888888889">
Tense forms can have several meanings or func-
tions in discourse. Plusqueparfait for instance has a
reading as flashback, and a perfective state reading
with the temporal perspective &amp;quot;speech-time&amp;quot; or ac-
tually reached &amp;quot;reference time&amp;quot;. Imparfait can have
the perspective in the past at the reference time or
at the speech time. Following Kamp/Rohrer (1985),
the meanings of the main narrative tenses can be
described in the following way:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.997840625">

</table>
<figureCaption confidence="0.463258769230769">
Since it is not desirable to represent these am-
biguities syntactically we use the Kamp/Rohrer
categories in a slightly different way to get unique
descriptions of the tenses. It is completely left to
the resolver to account for these ambiguities. Since
we exclude the TP-feature we need the additional
TENSE-value conditionnel. To mark tenses in in-
direct discourse the transposed-feature is added:
feature value
perf +1.-
prog +1-
tense past/presentifuture/conditionnel
transposed +1-
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.997939">
Since we do not discuss embedded clauses in this
paper, in the following the transposed-feature is
skipped. The tenses are analyzed by these means
as shown in Table 1.

4.3 Tenses and Temporal Adjuncts
in the Composer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991478">
Here we will discuss what sort of information the
Composer adds to the Proto-DRS when it encoun-
ters a tense feature or temporal adjunct or sub-
clause. It consists basically of two kinds:

DRF the temporal discourse referent, which the
resolution process has to locate, usually intro-
duced by the verb
Pos verb position in surface structure,
TF tf(Perf,Prog,71), the temporal features term.
The Pen-slot marks the analytic tenses, Frog

passé simple, Tr stands for the value of the
transposed feature.
Tense past I present I future I conditionnel, values

tense marker, indicating that the occ-term stems
from a tense feature. It is also the trigger for
temporal resolution.
Pointer indicates the occurrence of the tense in
main or embedded clauses. The clauses are in-
dexed in a unique way (by natural numbers).
The pointer is a pair consisting of the index
of the sup erordinate clause and the index of
the clause itself. Main clauses point to them-
selves. Such an indication is necessary for the
treatment of embedded sentences. The pointer
encodes a simplified tree structure for the sen-
tence and allows moving around in the tree.
Temporal adjuncts and subclauses also provide oc-
currence information marked in a special way. They
contribute an occ-term of the following kind:
occ(DRF,Pos,_ ,Rel, set- time, Pointer)

set-time indicates a special resolution mode for
temporal adjuncts and indicates that this in-
formation was contributed by a temporal ad-
junct. In the resolution process the marker will
cause the DRFs of the tense markers to resolve
to DRF.
The information shown in table 2 is introduced by
the Composer for the tenses (the &amp;quot;..&amp;quot; represent ini-
tially empty slots which get filled in in the process
of combining the meanings).
It will be noticed that the tenses do not intro-
duce new conditions into the DRS since the tem-
poral relations cannot be determined without re-
spect to the nature of the temporal &apos;antecedent&apos;
and therefore have to be generated in the Resolver.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99722">
4.4 Temporal Resolution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997821">
For temporal resolution the Resolver uses a stack
of a system of times consisting of quintuples of the
form:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.950172777777778">
- 47 -
1. reference time (usually the last event)
2. temporal perspective point
3. temporal location time (usually identical to
the reference time)
4. speech time (at present kept constant for the
whole discourse)
5. last resolved tense (with its occurence infor-
mation)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982780859504133">
Every resolution process generates such a quintu-
ple which gets stacked. If the temporal perspective
point is changed (plusqueparfait and conditionnel),
a substack is created and used till the original per-
spective point is restored.
The resolver removes the occurrence informa-
tion for the tenses and temporal adjuncts from the
proto-DRS. The tenses get resolved according to
the rules discussed below. The presence of tempo-
ral adjuncts changes the flow of resolution as it re-
quires that the temporal DRF introduced by the
adjunct has to be resolved in accordance with the
DRF introduced by the tense.
We will illustrate the effect of some resolution
rules reflecting the heuristics of the system by dis-
cussing two sample texts.
sl Ce jour-la ii pleuvait tres fort.
e2 Jean regarda par la fenetre.
s3 Marie n&apos;etait pas la.
e4 Il mit son impermeable
e5 et sortit.
ce jour-la introduces the location time t for the
first state, sl, (p/euvoir). The Composer augments
the DRS by the condition day(t) and the Resolver
by the condition t C s1.5 The first times-quintuple
consists of a variable for the reference time, (no
event is actually mentioned), the perspective point
is assumed to be the speech time. The speech time
is fixed by &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;, t is the location time and in the
last position the occ-term of sl is stored. Since a
reference time does not yet exist, the integration
of e2 produces a temporal relation with respect
to the last location time: e2 C t, i.e. e2 happens
within t. A second times-quintuple is put onto the
stack with the reference time e2 and the new occ-
term. The other time coordinates remain constant.
5Because of the definite description ce jour-la the NP-
Resolver has to establish an equation between t and a DRF
of the preceeding text which is a day. If there is no such
antecedent t has to be accomodated. The latter case is at
present not implemented.
e2 serves now as reference time for s3. The new n
lation e2 c s3 is introduced and the informatic
which stems from the occ-term of s3 and the ol
tenses is put as a third times quintuple onto ti
stack. The reference time is not changed. It shoul
be noticed that for new states the &amp;quot;smallest&amp;quot; avai
able location time is used. Normally this is the re
erence time of the previous quintuple if existen
For it is not necessary that the explicit given bc
tion time, ce jour-la in the given example, servi
as location time for subsequently introduced stab
as well. e4 is ordered with respect to e2, e5 with r
spect to e4 by the not-before-relation and the time
stack is updated in the obvious way. All states ar
events are located obviously before the speech tin
now. We omit the full DRS of the example here.
el Le 6 octobre Pierre arriva a Paris.

stack in the stack is created and the new eve]
serves as reference time for subsequent events
the flashback. The last reference time of the high
level is now regarded as temporal perspective f
the events occcuring in the flashback. They are I
calized before that perspective. le lende main in ti
third sentence has to be resolved to an existing rE
erence time, i.e. el or e2. Since we are already
a flashback, in processing the plusqueparfait of
the continuation of this flashback is preferred. Thi
a solution with el as antecedent for le lendema
would lead to a cyclic structure and should be rub
out by the inference component. The correct orde
ing conditions are given by establishing e2 as a
tecedent for the time introduced by le lendemai
and t as location time for e3. The perspective tin
is copied from the stack. Thus we get the conc
tions:
e2 &lt; t,e3 C t,e3 &lt; el
The embedded stack is updated by the new qui
tuple.
The implemented heuristics require that the ten

simple or passe compose or the explicit reference
to the perspective point, for instance by means of
&amp;quot;maintenant&amp;quot;, always lead to a reactivation of the
initial level, from which the first flashback started,
that is, all substacks are popped. Without main-
tenant the imparfait of sl could lead to the con-
tinuation of the flashback or to the continuation of
the main story. It is regarded as the state variant
of both categories.
The (simpified) DRS of the example above
thus looks as follows:
In our opinion cases as in the example above
cannot be treated without adding new parame-
ters to the Reichenbachian system. At least doing
it facilitates the job. Beyond the imparfait/passe
simple, passe compose-distinction French does not
make use of an explicit morphological aspect mark-
ing. Therefore, for instance in the case of condition-
nel, treated as anticipation of an episode, we use
the Aktionsart-characterization of the verb stored
in the temporal sort of the DRF to specify the value
of the prog-feature. An episode of states and dy-
namics then is treated similar to an imparfait-passe
simple-story transposed by the stored (past) per-
spective time. By this means we get an interaction
of Aktionsarten and tenses.
Similar to the case of flashback the tense
switch from conditionnel to another past tense form
marks the end of the anticipation and the reactiva-
tion of the initial level.

Thus the output event structure is generally under-
specified. The integration of an inference compo-
nent combined with background knowledge should
restrict the number of possibilities to order the
events linearly. In dependance of the Aktionsart the
events of the DRS can be assigned sub events mark-
ing the boundaries of the event as suggested by
Moens and Steedman(1986), (cf. Eberle(1988b)).
These subevents can be regarded as having no tem-
poral extension. Thus on the subevent-level before
and equivalent exhaust the intuitive possibilities of
temporal relations. By means of this finer gran-
ulation the (linear) event substructure of a DRS
corresponds to a unique (linear) interval struc-
ture provided the event relations before and over-
lap are defined in terms of Allen&apos;s interval struc-
tures (cf. Allen(1983)). Thus inferencing systems
which deal with intervals, as the Allen system, be-
come available but also systems which deal with
point-like events as the event calculus of Kowal-
ski/Sergot(1985). In addition we get the possibility
to deal with temporal relations on different levels
of precision.
In Eberle(1988a) the possibilities of monotonic
reasoning in partial event structures (in the sense of
the Kowalski/Sergot-approach) were investigated.
It is planned to extend the algorithm suggested
there which adds deduced events to the structure,
in order to deal with measure statements, knowl-
edge about hierarchies of event types (e.g. sub event

typologies) and temporal frames for event types
(average duration of an event type). One aim is
to rule out circular structures as mentioned in sec-
tion 4.4. For simple cases we are able to do it yet.
In such conflicting cases one has to backtrack to
the Resolver, the Composer or the Parser to gen-
erate other readings. In this sense the suggested
analysis system is non-monotonic since it generates
other temporal relations if necessary. When finally
a consistent reading has been arrived at, the event
calculus can be used for non-monotonic reasoning,
e.g.to deal with the problem of the validity of lo-
cation times with respect to events localized before
or after events for which an explicit relation of in-
clusion holds.

<abstract confidence="0.998799111111111">A proposal to deal with French tenses in the framework of Discourse Representation Theory is presented, as it has been implemented for a fragment at the IMS. It is based on the theory of tenses of and Ch. Rohrer. Instead of using operators to express the meaning of the tenses the Reichenbachian point of view is adopted and refined such that the impact of the tenses with respect to the meaning of the text is understood as contribution to the integration of the events of a sentence in the event structure of the preceeding text. Thereby a system of relevant times provided by the preceeding text and by the temporal adverbials of the sentence being processed used. This system consists of one or more reftimes perspective times, time the time. special interest of our proposal is to establish a plausible choice of &amp;quot;anchors&amp;quot; for the new event out of the system of relevant times and to update this system of temporal coordinates correctly. The problem of choice is largely neglected in the literature. In opposition to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the exact meaning of the tenses is fixed by the resolution component and not in the process of syntactic analysis.</abstract>
