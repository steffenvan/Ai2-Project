Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999665583333333">
For biomedical information extraction, most sys-
tems use syntactic patterns on verbs (anchor verbs)
and their arguments. Anchor verbs can be se-
lected by focusing on their arguments. We propose
to use predicate-argument structures (PASs), which
are outputs of a full parser, to obtain verbs and their
arguments. In this paper, we evaluated PAS method
by comparing it to a method using part of speech
(POSs) pattern matching. POS patterns produced
larger results with incorrect arguments, and the re-
sults will cause adverse effects on a phase selecting
appropriate verbs.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900787878788">
Research in molecular-biology field is discovering
enormous amount of new facts, and thus there is
an increasing need for information extraction (IE)
technology to support database building and to find
novel knowledge in online journals.
To implement IE systems, we need to construct
extraction rules, i.e., rules to extract desired infor-
mation from processed resource. One subtask of the
construction is defining a set of anchor verbs, which
express realization of desired information in natural
language text.
In this paper, we propose a novel method of
finding anchor verbs: extracting anchor verbs from
predicate-argument structures (PASs) obtained by
full parsing. We here discuss only finding anchor
verbs, although our final purpose is construction
of extraction rules. Most anchor verbs take topi-
cal nouns, i.e., nouns describing target entities for
IE, as their arguments. Thus verbs which take top-
ical nouns can be candidates for anchor verbs. Our
method collects anchor verb candidates by choosing
PASs whose arguments are topical nouns. Then, se-
mantically inappropriate verbs are filtered out. We
leave this filtering phase as a future work, and dis-
cuss the acquisition of candidates. We have also in-
vestigated difference in verbs and their arguments
extracted by naive POS patterns and PAS method.
When anchor verbs are found based on whether
their arguments are topical nouns, like in (Hatzivas-
siloglou and Weng, 2002), it is important to obtain
correct arguments. Thus, in this paper, we set our
goal to obtain anchor verb candidates and their cor-
rect arguments.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829137931034">
There are some works on acquiring extraction rules
automatically. Sudo et al. (2003) acquired subtrees
derived from dependency trees as extraction rules
for IE in general domains. One problem of their sys-
tem is that dependency trees cannot treat non-local
dependencies, and thus rules acquired from the con-
structions are partial. Hatzivassiloglou and Weng
(2002) used frequency of collocation of verbs and
topical nouns and verb occurrence rates in several
domains to obtain anchor verbs for biological inter-
action. They used only POSs and word positions
to detect relations between verbs and topical nouns.
Their performance was 87.5% precision and 82.4%
recall. One of the reasons of errors they reported is
failures to detect verb-noun relations.
To avoid these problems, we decided to use PASs
obtained by full parsing to get precise relations be-
tween verbs and their arguments. The obtained pre-
cise relations will improve precision. In addition,
PASs obtained by full parsing can treat non-local
dependencies, thus recall will also be improved.
The sentence below is an example which sup-
ports advantage of full parsing. A gerund “activat-
ing” takes a non-local semantic subject “IL-4”. In
full parsing based on Head-Driven Phrase Structure
Grammar (HPSG) (Sag and Wasow, 1999), the sub-
ject of the whole sentence and the semantic subject
of “activating” are shared, and thus we can extract
the subject of “activating”.

Next, in Step 2, we check each argument of (a),
(b) and (c). (a) is discarded because it does not have
a topical noun argument.2 (b) is selected because
ARG1 “regions” is a topical noun. Similarly, (c) is
selected because of ARG1 “molecules”.
And then, in Step 3, we check each POS of a
predicate included in (b) and (c). (b) is selected be-

3 Anchor Verb Finding by PASs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.6872135">
By using PASs, we extract candidates for anchor
verbs from a sentence in the following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9903894">
1. Obtain all PASs of a sentence by a full
parser. The PASs correspond not only to verbal
phrases but also other phrases such as preposi-
tional phrases.
2. Select PASs which take one or more topical
nouns as arguments.
3. From the selected PASs in Step 2, select PASs
which include one or more verbs.
4. Extract a core verb, which is the innermost ver-
bal predicate, from each of the chosen PASs.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998028380952381">
In Step 1, we use a probabilistic HPSG parser
developed by Miyao et al. (2003), (2004). PASs
obtained by the parser are illustrated in Figure 1.1
Bold words are predicates. Arguments of the predi-
cates are described in ARGn (n = 1, 2, ...). MOD-
IFY denotes the modified PAS. Numbers in squares
denote shared structures. Examples of core verbs
are illustrated in Figure 2. We regard all arguments
in a PAS are arguments of the core verb.
Extraction of candidates for anchor verbs from
the sentence in Figure 1 is as follows. Here, ”re-
gions” and ”molecules” are topical nouns.
In Step 1, we obtain all the PASs, (a), (b) and (c),
in Figure 1.

internal structures of noun phrases are not illustrated.
the structure with (a). (c) is discarded because it
includes no verbs.
Finally, in Step 4, we extract a core verb from (b).
(b) includes 1 as MODIFY, and the predicate of 1
is the verb, “interacts”. So we extract it.

<bodyText confidence="0.999916411764706">
We investigated the verbs and their arguments ex-
tracted by PAS method and POS pattern matching,
which is less expressive in analyzing sentence struc-
tures but would be more robust.
For topical nouns and POSs, we used the GENIA
corpus (Kim et al., 2003), a corpus of annotated ab-
stracts taken from National Library of Medicine’s
MEDLINE database. We defined topical nouns as
the names tagged as protein, peptide, amino acid,
DNA, RNA, or nucleic acid. We chose PASs which
take one or more topical nouns as an argument or
arguments, and substrings matched by POS patterns
which include topical nouns. All names tagged in
the corpus were replaced by their head nouns in
order to reduce complexity of sentences and thus
reduce the task of the parser and the POS pattern
matcher.

For the first 10 abstracts (92 sentences), we man-
ually investigated whether extracted VAs are syn-
tactically or semantically correct. The investigation
was based on two criteria: “appropriateness” based
on whether the extracted verb can be used for an an-
chor verb and “correctness” based on whether the
syntactical analysis is correct, i.e., whether the ar-
guments were extracted correctly.
Based on human judgment, the verbs that rep-
resent interactions, events, and properties were se-
lected as semantically appropriate for anchor verbs,
and the others were treated as inappropriate. For ex-
ample, “identified” in “We identified ZEBRA pro-
tein.” is not appropriate and discarded.
We did not consider non-topical noun arguments
for POS pattern method, whereas we considered
them for PAS method. Thus decision on correctness
is stricter for PAS method.

The manual investigation results on extracted
VAs from the 10 abstracts using POS patterns and
PASs are shown in Table 2 and 3 respectively.
POS patterns extracted more (98) VAs than PASs
(75), but many of the increment were from incor-
rect POS pattern matching. By POS patterns, 43
VAs (44%) were extracted based on incorrect anal-
ysis. On the other hand, by PASs, 20 VAs (27%)
were extracted incorrectly. Thus the ratio of VAs
extracted by syntactically correct analysis is larger
on PAS method.
POS pattern method extracted 38 VAs of verbs
not extracted by PAS method and 7 of them are cor-
rect. For PAS method, correspondent numbers are

11 and 4 respectively. Thus the increments tend to
be caused by incorrect analysis, and the tendency is
greater in POS pattern method.
Since not all of verbs that take topical nouns are
appropriate for anchor verbs, automatic filtering is
required. In the filtering phase that we leave as a
future work, we can use semantical classes and fre-
quencies of arguments of the verbs. The results with
syntactically incorrect arguments will cause adverse
effect on filtering because they express incorrect re-
lationship between verbs and arguments. Since the
numbers of extracted VAs after excluding the ones
with incorrect arguments are the same (55) between
PAS and POS pattern methods, it can be concluded
that the precision of PAS method is higher. Al-
though there are few (7) correct VAs which were
extracted by POS pattern method but not by PAS
method, we expect the number of such verbs can be
reduced using a larger corpus.
Examples of appropriate VAs extracted by only
one method are as follows: (A) is correct and (B)
incorrect, extracted by only POS pattern method,
and (C) is correct and (D) incorrect, extracted by
only PAS method. Bold words are extracted verbs
or predicates and italic words their extracted argu-
ments.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999628125">
We have proposed a method of extracting anchor
verbs as elements of extraction rules for IE by us-
ing PASs obtained by full parsing. To compare
our method with more naive and robust methods,
we have extracted verbs and their arguments using
POS patterns and PASs. POS pattern method could
obtain more candidate verbs for anchor verbs, but
many of them were extracted with incorrect argu-
ments by incorrect matching. A later filtering pro-
cess benefits by precise relations between verbs and
their arguments which PASs obtained. The short-
coming of PAS method is expected to be reduced by
using a larger corpus, because verbs to extract will
appear many times in many forms. One of the future
works is to extend PAS method to handle events in
nominalized forms.

We defined topical nouns as the names tagged as protein, peptide, amino acid, DNA, RNA, or nucleic acid. We chose PASs which take one or more topical nouns as an argument or arguments, and substrings matched by POS patterns which include topical nouns. All names tagged in the corpus were replaced by their head nouns in order to reduce complexity of sentences and thus reduce the task of the parser and the POS pattern matcher. 4.1 Implementation of PAS method We implemented PAS method on LiLFeS, a unification-based programming system for typed feature structures (Makino et al., 1998; Miyao et al., 2000). The selection in Step 2 described in Section 3 is realized by matching PASs with nine PAS templates. Four of the templates are illustrated in Figure 3. 4.2 POS Pattern Method We constructed a POS pattern matcher with a partial verb chunking function according to (Hatzivassiloglou and Weng, 2002). Because the original matcher has problems in recall (its verb group detector has low coverage) and precision (it does not consider other words to detect relations between verb groups and topical nouns), we implemented 2(a) may be selected if the anaphora (“it”) is resolved. But we regard anaphora re</context>

Obtain all PASs of a sentence by a full parser. The PASs correspond not only to verbal phrases but also other phrases such as prepositional phrases. 2. Select PASs which take one or more topical nouns as arguments. 3. From the selected PASs in Step 2, select PASs which include one or more verbs. 4. Extract a core verb, which is the innermost verbal predicate, from each of the chosen PASs. In Step 1, we use a probabilistic HPSG parser developed by Miyao et al. (2003), (2004). PASs obtained by the parser are illustrated in Figure 1.1 Bold words are predicates. Arguments of the predicates are described in ARGn (n = 1, 2, ...). MODIFY denotes the modified PAS. Numbers in squares denote shared structures. Examples of core verbs are illustrated in Figure 2. We regard all arguments in a PAS are arguments of the core verb. Extraction of candidates for anchor verbs from the sentence in Figure 1 is as follows. Here, ”regions” and ”molecules” are topical nouns. In Step 1, we obtain all the PASs, (a), (b) and (c), in Figure 1. 1Here, named entities are regarded as c</context>

To avoid these problems, we decided to use PASs obtained by full parsing to get precise relations between verbs and their arguments. The obtained precise relations will improve precision. In addition, PASs obtained by full parsing can treat non-local dependencies, thus recall will also be improved. The sentence below is an example which supports advantage of full parsing. A gerund “activating” takes a non-local semantic subject “IL-4”. In full parsing based on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Sag and Wasow, 1999), the subject of the whole sentence and the semantic subject of “activating” are shared, and thus we can extract the subject of “activating”. IL-4 may mediate its biological effects by activating a tyrosine-phosphorylated DNA binding protein. It interacts with non-polymorphic regions of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Next, in Step 2, we check each argument of (a), (b) and (c). (a) is discarded because it does not have a topical noun argument.2 (b) is selected because ARG1 “regions” is a topical noun. Similarly, (c) is selected because of ARG1 “molecules”. And then, in Ste</context>

We leave this filtering phase as a future work, and discuss the acquisition of candidates. We have also investigated difference in verbs and their arguments extracted by naive POS patterns and PAS method. When anchor verbs are found based on whether their arguments are topical nouns, like in (Hatzivassiloglou and Weng, 2002), it is important to obtain correct arguments. Thus, in this paper, we set our goal to obtain anchor verb candidates and their correct arguments. 2 Background There are some works on acquiring extraction rules automatically. Sudo et al. (2003) acquired subtrees derived from dependency trees as extraction rules for IE in general domains. One problem of their system is that dependency trees cannot treat non-local dependencies, and thus rules acquired from the constructions are partial. Hatzivassiloglou and Weng (2002) used frequency of collocation of verbs and topical nouns and verb occurrence rates in several domains to obtain anchor verbs for biological interaction. They used only POSs and word positions to detect relations between verbs and topical nouns. Their performance was 87.5% precision and 82.4% recall. One of the reasons o</context>
