Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973363636364">
The problem we address in this paper is
that of providing contextual examples of
translation equivalents for words from the
general lexicon using comparable corpora
and semantic annotation that is uniform
for the source and target languages. For
a sentence, phrase or a query expression in
the source language the tool detects the se-
mantic type of the situation in question and
gives examples of similar contexts from
the target language corpus.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998743127272727">
It is widely acknowledged that human transla-
tors can benefit from a wide range of applications
in computational linguistics, including Machine
Translation (Carl and Way, 2003), Translation
Memory (Planas and Furuse, 2000), etc. There
have been recent research on tools detecting trans-
lation equivalents for technical vocabulary in a re-
stricted domain, e.g. (Dagan and Church, 1997;
Bennison and Bowker, 2000). The methodology
in this case is based on extraction of terminology
(both single and multiword units) and alignment
of extracted terms using linguistic and/or statisti-
cal techniques (Déjean et al., 2002).
In this project we concentrate on words from the
general lexicon instead of terminology. The ratio-
nale for this focus is related to the fact that trans-
lation of terms is (should be) stable, while gen-
eral words can vary significantly in their transla-
tion. It is important to populate the terminologi-
cal database with terms that are missed in dictio-
naries or specific to a problem domain. However,
once the translation of a term in a domain has been
identified, stored in a dictionary and learned by
the translator, the process of translation can go on
without consulting a dictionary or a corpus.
In contrast, words from the general lexicon ex-
hibit polysemy, which is reflected differently in
the target language, thus causing the dependency
of their translation on corresponding context. It
also happens quite frequently that such variation
is not captured by dictionaries. Novice translators
tend to rely on dictionaries and use direct trans-
lation equivalents whenever they are available. In
the end they produce translations that look awk-
ward and do not deliver the meaning intended by
the original text.
Parallel corpora consisting of original texts
aligned with their translations offer the possibility
to search for examples of translations in their con-
text. In this respect they provide a useful supple-
ment to decontextualised translation equivalents
listed in dictionaries. However, parallel corpora
are not representative: millions of pages of orig-
inal texts are produced daily by native speakers
in major languages, such as English, while trans-
lations are produced by a small community of
trained translators from a small subset of source
texts. The imbalance between original texts and
translations is also reflected in the size of parallel
corpora, which are simply too small for variations
in translation of moderately frequent words. For
instance, frustrate occurs 631 times in 100 million
words of the BNC, i.e. this gives in average about
6 uses in a typical parallel corpus of one million
words.

amples in the target language that are semantically
and syntactically related to a selected example in
the source language. To enable greater coverage
we will exploit comparable rather than parallel
corpora.
Our research hypothesis leads us to a number of
research questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.95024325">
• Which semantic and syntactic contextual fea-
tures of the selected example in the source
language are important?
• How do we find similar contextual examples
in the target language?
• How do we sort the suggested target lan-
guage contextual examples in order to max-
imise their usefulness?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999024">
In order to restrict the research to what is
achievable within the scope of this project, we are
focussing on translation from English to Russian
using a comparable corpus of British and Rus-
sian newspaper texts. Newspapers cover a large
set of clearly identifiable topics that are compara-
ble across languages and cultures. In this project,
we have collected a 200-million-word corpus of
four major British newspapers and a 70-million-
word corpus of three major Russian newspapers
for roughly the same time span (2003-2004).1
In our proposed method, contexts of uses of En-
glish expressions defined by keywords are com-
pared to similar Russian expressions, using se-
mantic classes such as persons, places and insti-
tutions. For instance, the word agreement in the
example the parties were frustratingly close to
an agreement = ñòîðîíû áûëè äî îáèäíîãî áëèçêè
ê äîñòèæåíèþ ñîãëàøåíèÿ belongs to a seman-
tic class that also includes arrangement, contract,
deal, treaty. In the result, the search for collo-
cates of áëèçêèé (close) in the context of agree-
ment words in Russian gives a short list of mod-
ifiers, which also includes the target: äî îáèäíîãî
áëèçêè.

2.2 Semantic taggers

<bodyText confidence="0.999701">
In this project, we are porting the Lancaster En-
glish Semantic Tagger (EST) to the Russian lan-
guage. We have reused the existing semantic field
taxonomy of the Lancaster UCREL semantic anal-
ysis system (USAS), and applied it to Russian. We

have also reused the existing software framework
developed during the construction of a Finnish Se-
mantic Tagger (Löfberg et al., 2005); the main ad-
justments and modifications required for Finnish
were to cope with the Unicode character set (UTF-
8) and word compounding.
USAS-EST is a software system for automatic
semantic analysis of text that was designed at
Lancaster University (Rayson et al., 2004). The
semantic tagset used by USAS was originally
loosely based on Tom McArthur’s Longman Lexi-
con of Contemporary English (McArthur, 1981).
It has a multi-tier structure with 21 major dis-
course fields, subdivided into 232 sub-categories.2
In the ASSIST project, we have been working on
both improving the existing EST and developing a
parallel tool for Russian - Russian Semantic Tag-
ger (RST). We have found that the USAS semantic
categories were compatible with the semantic cat-
egorizations of objects and phenomena in Russian,
as in the following example:3
poor JJ I1.1- A5.1- N5- E4.1- X9.1-
áåäíûé A I1.1- A6.3- N5- O4.2- E4.1-
However, we needed a tool for analysing the
complex morpho-syntactic structure of Russian
words. Unlike English, Russian is a highly in-
flected language: generally, what is expressed in
English through phrases or syntactic structures
is expressed in Russian via morphological in-
flections, especially case endings and affixation.
For this purpose, we adopted a Russian morpho-
syntactic analyser Mystem that identifies word
forms, lemmas and morphological characteristics
for each word. Mystem is used as the equivalent
of the CLAWS part-of-speech (POS) tagger in the
USAS framework. Furthermore, we adopted the
Unicode UTF-8 encoding scheme to cope with the
Cyrillic alphabet. Despite these modifications, the
architecture of the RST software mirrors that of
the EST components in general.
The main lexical resources of the RST include
a single-word lexicon and a lexicon of multi-word
expressions (MWEs). We are building the Russian
lexical resources by exploiting both dictionaries
and corpora. We use readily available resources,
e.g. lists of proper names, which are then se-

mantically classified. To bootstrap the system, we
have hand-tagged the 3,000 most frequent Russian
words based on a large newspaper corpus. Subse-
quently, the lexicons will be further expanded by
feeding texts from various sources into the RST
and classifying words that remain unmatched. In
addition, we will experiment with semi-automatic
lexicon construction using an existing machine-
readable English-Russian bilingual dictionary to
populate the Russian lexicon by mapping words
from each of the semantic fields in the English lex-
icon in turn. We aim at coverage of around 30,000
single lexical items and up to 9,000 MWEs, com-
pared to the EST which currently contains 54,727
single lexical items and 18,814 MWEs.

2.3 The user interface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995677419355">
The interface is powered by IMS Corpus Work-
bench (Christ, 1994) and is designed to be used in
the day-to-day workflow of novice and practising
translators, so the syntax of the CWB query lan-
guage has been simplified to adapt it to the needs
of the target user community.
The interface implements a search model for
finding translation equivalents in monolingual
comparable corpora, which integrates a number of
statistical and rule-based techniques for extending
search space, translating words and multiword ex-
pressions into the target language and restricting
the number of returned candidates in order to max-
imise precision and recall of relevant translation
equivalents. In the proposed search model queries
can be expanded by generating lists of collocations
for a given word or phrase, by generating sim-
ilarity classes4 or by manual selection of words
in concordances. Transfer between the source
language and target language is done via lookup
in a bilingual dictionary or via UCREL seman-
tic codes, which are common for concepts in both
languages. The search space is further restricted
by applying knowledge-based and statistical fil-
ters (such as part-of-speech and semantic class fil-
ters, IDF filter, etc), by testing the co-occurrence
of members of different similarity classes or by
manually selecting the presented variants. These
procedures are elementary building blocks that are
used in designing different search strategies effi-
cient for different types of translation equivalents

(Rapp, 2004), e.g. Paris and Strasbourg are produced for

and contexts.
The core functionality of the system is intended
to be self-explanatory and to have a shallow learn-
ing curve: in many cases default search parame-
ters work well, so it is sufficient to input a word
or an expression in the source language in or-
der to get back a useful list of translation equiv-
alents, which can be manually checked by a trans-
lator to identify the most suitable solution for a
given context. For example, the word combina-
tion frustrated passenger is not found in the ma-
jor English-Russian dictionaries, while none of the
candidate translations of frustrated are suitable in
this context. The default search strategy for this
phrase is to generate the similarity class for En-
glish words frustrate, passenger, produce all pos-
sible translations using a dictionary and to test co-
occurrence of the resulting Russian words in target
language corpora. This returns a list of 32 Rus-
sian phrases, which follow the pattern of ‘annoyed
/ impatient / unhappy + commuter / passenger /
driver’. Among other examples the list includes
an appropriate translation íåäîâîëüíûé ïàññàæèð
(‘unsatisfied passenger’).
The following example demonstrates the sys-
tem’s ability to find equivalents when there is
a reliable context to identify terms in the two
languages. Recent political developments in
Russia produced a new expression ïðåäñòàâèòåëü
ïðåçèäåíòà (‘representative of president’), which
is as yet too novel to be listed in dictionaries.
However, the system can help to identify the peo-
ple that perform this duty, translate their names
to English and extract the set of collocates that
frequently appear around their names in British
newspapers, including Putin’s personal envoy and
Putin’s regional representative, even if no specific
term has been established for this purpose in the
British media.
As words cannot be translated in isolation and
their potential translation equivalents also often
consist of several words, the system detects not
only single-word collocates, but also multiword
expressions. For instance, the set of Russian
collocates of áþðîêðàòèÿ (bureaucracy) includes
➪ðþññåëü (Brussels), which offers a straightfor-
ward translation into English and has such mul-
tiword collocates as red tape, which is a suitable
contextual translation for áþðîêðàòèÿ.
More experienced users can modify default pa-
rameters and try alternative strategies, construct

their own search paths from available basic build-
ing blocks and store them for future use. Stored
strategies comprise several elementary stages but
are executed in one go, although intermediate re-
sults can also be accessed via the “history” frame.
Several search paths can be tried in parallel and
displayed together, so an optimal strategy for a
given class of phrases can be more easily identi-
fied.
Unlike Machine Translation, the system does
not translate texts. The main thrust of the sys-
tem lies in its ability to find several target language
examples that are relevant to the source language
expression. In some cases this results in sugges-
tions that can be directly used for translating the
source example, while in other cases the system
provides hints for the translator about the range of
target language expressions beyond what is avail-
able in bilingual dictionaries. Even if the preci-
sion of the current version is not satisfactory for an
MT system (2-3 suitable translations out of 30-50
suggested examples), human translators are able
to skim through the suggested set to find what is
relevant for the given translation task.

3 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948161290323">
The set of tools is now under further development.
This involves an extension of the English seman-
tic tagger, development of the Russian tagger with
the target lexical coverage of 90% of source texts,
designing the procedure for retrieval of semanti-
cally similar situations and completing the user in-
terface. Identification of semantically similar sit-
uations can be improved by the use of segment-
matching algorithms as employed in Example-
Based MT and translation memories (Planas and
Furuse, 2000; Carl and Way, 2003).
There are two main applications of the pro-
posed methodology. One concerns training trans-
lators and advanced foreign language (FL) learn-
ers to make them aware of the variety of transla-
tion equivalents beyond the set offered by the dic-
tionary. The other application pertains to the de-
velopment of tools for practising translators. Al-
though the Russian language is not typologically
close to English and uses another writing system
which does not allow easy identification of cog-
nates, Russian and English belong to the same
Indo-European family and the contents of Rus-
sian and English newspapers reflect the same set
of topics. Nevertheless, the application of this
research need not be restricted to the English-
Russian pair only. The methodology for multilin-
gual processing of monolingual comparable cor-
pora, first tested in this project, will provide a
blueprint for the development of similar tools for
other language combinations.

For a sentence, phrase or a query expression in the source language the tool detects the semantic type of the situation in question and gives examples of similar contexts from the target language corpus. 1 Introduction It is widely acknowledged that human translators can benefit from a wide range of applications in computational linguistics, including Machine Translation (Carl and Way, 2003), Translation Memory (Planas and Furuse, 2000), etc. There have been recent research on tools detecting translation equivalents for technical vocabulary in a restricted domain, e.g. (Dagan and Church, 1997; Bennison and Bowker, 2000). The methodology in this case is based on extraction of terminology (both single and multiword units) and alignment of extracted terms using linguistic and/or statistical techniques (Déjean et al., 2002). In this project we concentrate on words from the general lexicon instead of terminology. The rationale for this focus is related to the fact that translation of terms is (should be) stable, while general wor</context>

This involves an extension of the English semantic tagger, development of the Russian tagger with the target lexical coverage of 90% of source texts, designing the procedure for retrieval of semantically similar situations and completing the user interface. Identification of semantically similar situations can be improved by the use of segmentmatching algorithms as employed in ExampleBased MT and translation memories (Planas and Furuse, 2000; Carl and Way, 2003). There are two main applications of the proposed methodology. One concerns training translators and advanced foreign language (FL) learners to make them aware of the variety of translation equivalents beyond the set offered by the dictionary. The other application pertains to the development of tools for practising translators. Although the Russian language is not typologically close to English and uses another writing system which does not allow easy identification of cognates, Russian and English belong to the same Indo-European family and the contents of Russian and En</context>

The search space is further restricted by applying knowledge-based and statistical filters (such as part-of-speech and semantic class filters, IDF filter, etc), by testing the co-occurrence of members of different similarity classes or by manually selecting the presented variants. These procedures are elementary building blocks that are used in designing different search strategies efficient for different types of translation equivalents 4Simclasses consist of words sharing collocates and are computed using Singular Value Decomposition, as used by (Rapp, 2004), e.g. Paris and Strasbourg are produced for Brussels, or bus, tram and driver for passenger. and contexts. The core functionality of the system is intended to be self-explanatory and to have a shallow learning curve: in many cases default search parameters work well, so it is sufficient to input a word or an expression in the source language in order to get back a useful list of translation equivalents, which can be manually checked by a translator to identify the most suitable solution for a given context. For example, the word combination frustrated passenger is not found in the major Engli</context>
