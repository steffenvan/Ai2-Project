Clippinger&apos;s book on discourse is aimed at linguists,
psychologists, psychiatrists, and researchers in artificial
intelligence, and in 100,000 words, almost totally de-
void of humor, he takes on Freud, Piaget, Bateson,
Colby, and Schank; he offers homage to HACKER
and kudos to CONNIVER; he ignores both linguistics
and Al work in natural-language generation; he in-
vents a grammar of English; he performs validation
tests on a hand-simulated program; and he closes by
warning us about ignoring the social impact of com-
puters in the future. All of this is background to a
program that models one, halting paragraph of speech
by a depressed patient whose request to change the
form in which she pays her therapist is, we are told in
great detail, a desire for intercourse.
With regard to the process of producing language,
much of what Clippinger says is quite true, even en-
couraging. Real generation is not a simple mapping of
meaning representations into surface strings. Rather,
there is an enormous influence by other contextual
elements such as the speaker&apos;s intentions and the
speaker&apos;s model of the hearer&apos;s possible reactions, as
well as the problems of lexical choice and ordering,
compounded by the incessant demand to say something
despite a storm of conflicting, unorganized interests.
Here, Clippinger&apos;s high-level descriptions are useful in
reminding -- or informing -- us about the complica-
tions in actual speech, which are all the more obvious
in a psychiatric patient. He specifies a 4-point
&amp;quot;theory of thinking and speaking&amp;quot;: (1) knowledge
structures are organized by goals; (2) beliefs can be
inconsistent; (3) meaning depends on the context of
interpretation; (4) composing and producing a dis-
course occurs in 5 steps: identification of an accepta-
ble goal, planning the actual discourse, considering the
reaction by the listener, choosing the exact words, and
reviewing the final product. This, of course, works for
writing, too, or for that matter, for general problem-
solving, where carrying out physical acts substitutes
for choosing words. As an illustration of the complex-
ity of cognition, this text serves well.
The weaknesses of the book are in the lower-level
detail, and it is disappointing not to see the theory
better illustrated, especially since these details form
the bulk of the book.
The representation of meaning is hardly different
from the surface form. &amp;quot;George painted the house&amp;quot; is
represented as something on the order of (GEORGE
PAINT HOUSE). This can be modified with any of a
large number of &amp;quot;indicators&amp;quot; including the customary
ones like time and place, but also some problematic
ones like &amp;quot;condition,&amp;quot; which is defined as &amp;quot;those con-
cepts that must be valid in order for the indicated
concept to be valid,&amp;quot; a can of worms if ever there was
one. What would one do with the sentence &amp;quot;I must
leave at noon&amp;quot;? Is &amp;quot;at noon&amp;quot; a time or a condition?
The concepts are manipulated by pieces of the pro-
gram, whimsically labeled Leibnitz, Freud, Calvin,
Machiavelli, and Cicero. Calvin censors potential
output, Machiavelli plans, Cicero orates, and so forth.
Chapter 5 describes the &amp;quot;grammar for discourse&amp;quot; as
a series of rewriting rules. Clippinger&apos;s protests not-
withstanding, the grammar describes little more than
surface syntax. With examples like &amp;quot;It seems like only
yesterday, I left my mind behind&amp;quot; anyone would be on
dangerous semantic grounds.
The program that &amp;quot;generated&amp;quot; a text resembling
the actual speech by the psychiatric patient is barely
sketched out in Chapter 6. The program implements
only a small part of the theory, which is no surprise,
but Clippinger&apos;s apology is disingenuous:
The purpose in designing and writing the ERMA
program was to test out a theory of the discourse
formation and realization processes. In writing the
program, the entire discourse episode was analyzed
and hand-simulated. However, only part of the
entire discourse episode was computer-simulated.
The reason for this is simply that since all the ma-
jor representational and theoretical problems had
been worked out, the additional programming need-
ed to make the program complete would not have
contributed substantively to either the theory or the
methods developed. It is my belief that, as a re-
search strategy, little is gained, and often much is
lost, by developing massive operational programs
when the research is still in an exploratory stage.
[page 145]
In the last chapters, Clippinger expresses the view
that computer models of thinking may help psychiatry
by contributing a vocabulary, a new, more precise way
of thinking, and testable theoretical models, which
may indeed be the case some day, a phenomenon not
unknown to computer science. But he gets quite car-
ried away with an analogy between aspects of our
mental processes and the context mechanism in CON-
NIVER, described in terms that would make McDer-
mott and Sussman blush. Arguments along the line of
&amp;quot;My program fumbles and so do people so my pro-
gram is a model of thinking&amp;quot; are hopelessly reduction-
ist.
In all, this is a very ambitious work, and Clippinger
has much to say on a great many topics, so it is per-
haps less surprising that there is much to disagree
with. But all readers should benefit from the elabo-
rate reminder of the complexities of human speech.
