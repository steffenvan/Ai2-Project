Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962">
We attack the problem of aligning words from pairs of
bilingual sentences, rather than the well-known, and
somewhat easier, problem of aligning sentences. The
method that we develop is based on the use of bilingual
dictionaries, having supposed that lenunatization has
taken place. We first show that this method performs
poorly in terms of silence and noise. To improve its
performance we introduce syntactic dependency
relations between the words in each of the two
sentences considered. In this sense the syntagmatic
level comes to the rescue of the paradigmatic level at
which the alignment actually takes place.

I. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999880625">
Given that two sentences F and E are translations of
each other. Is there a simple method for aligning the
words in each sentence? In other words is word
alignment algorithmically simple to implement? We
shall see that this problem is extremely delicate, even
to be done by hand. To convince oneself, one need
merely attempt it in order to see how quickly the
choices pass from trivial to complicated. The
difficulties stem from there not always being a simple
one-to-one correspondence between the words of the
two sentences. One word may correspond to many
words (an expression); in other cases, one or many
words may correspond to no other words. On the other
hand, word order is rarely maintained, and to top
things di, different syntactic status create complicated
pairings when they do exist.

IL Conventions and restrictions concerning
manual alignment of words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.915813333333333">
Let&apos;s begin by the cases that will be excluded due to the
excessive level of difficulty that they present.
Consider the two sentences&apos; :
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.900784">
E 7 : Butj the 2 similarities 3 are 4 illusory5 .6
F 18 : Cesj comparaisons2 ont3 leurs4 limites5 :6
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.959191">
. All the pairs of sentences as examples are extracted from
The Acoustics of the Harpsichord (SCIENTIFIC
AMERICAN, February 1991) and its French translation
L&apos;acoustique du clavecin (POUR LA SCIENCE, avril 1991)
Although these sentences correspond to each other in
the text that they appeared in, we cannot establish an
alignment of their words. We will not study these cases
for a few reasons: first, outside of their context it is
difficult, even for human readers, to affirm their
semantic relation as a translation; secondly, in order to
align these sentences, the entire sentences must be
considered as an expression, and this is debatable.
How can manual alignments be represented?
We will distinguish the alignment of words and groups
of words whose mutual translation is established with
the aid of a bilingual dictionary from alignments that
are made from a local recomposition based on human
&amp;quot;comprehension&amp;quot; of the two sentences.
We will use the equal-sign (=) to mark links which
come from a bilingual dictionary and the star symbol
(*) to mark comprehension correspondences. We will
call the first type of correspondence &amp;quot;lexical
correspondence&amp;quot; and the second type &amp;quot;contextual
correspondence&amp;quot;.
The alignments (1-n) (m-1) or (m-n) are characterized
by the presence, on the same line, of more than one *
or =. Let&apos;s give an example:

III. Hypothesis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893">
As a basis of our algorithm we find the following
hypothesis. Consider two sentences F and E which are
translations of each other.
We say that two words f, and ef, belonging to F and E
respectively, correspond to each other if: i) they are
translations of each other; ii) they enter into the same
dependency relations with their neighbors; iii) they
occupy the same positions.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.940259" genericHeader="method">
IV. Potential Alignments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996305">
Consider the two sentences F and E. The potential
alignment of words is obtained by comparing each of
the words of one sentence with all of those from the
second sentence. The comparisons (fi, e„) are
established with the help of a simple word transfer
dictionary and the results are stored in am xn matrix
(m being the number of words in the French sentence
and n in the English). Each element receives a note
that is higher if the two words are: i) translations in
the dictionary, ii) long, iii) in the same position.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.816076">
V Ambiguity, noise and silence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946650125">
An alignment is &apos;ambiguous&apos; if more than one solution
is produced. Typology of errors (noise, silence): We
will call errors of noise those alignments created
between words should not be aligned, and errors of
silence missing alignments between words which were
manually aligned.
VL The reasons for noise and silence
Noise: At the root of noisy alignments we find the
problem ofpolysemy. When it is not resolved, it causes
words to be aligned through sense that are improper in
the current context.
Another source of error corresponds to simple errors of
alignment: the two words are translations of each other
but in the present context they should not be aligned.
For example, in the following sentences areas28 was
incorrectly aligned with zones/ 7.

<bodyText confidence="0.9994035">
Silence: The main problem is something missing from
the dictionary: either the head word is not present, or
the correct translation is absent. This is essentially the
non-recognition of synonymy that is the problem.

VII. Resolution by Analogic Reasoning
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994071">
In order to reduce both noise and silence, we use a
mechanism based on analogical reasoning. This is
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.986443">
189
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.793828571428571">
based on the following fundamental hypothesis:
paradigmatic relations can help determine
syntagmatic relations and vice-versa.
Using monolingual dependency relations.
The resolution mechanism can be understood from the
following diagram.

<bodyText confidence="0.982285">
On this figure are represented four words of which two
are aligned (fi, ep). Syntactic dependencies between
two other pairs of words [/, f,] and [e,, eq] are also
represented. We want to know how valid the
alignment between f, and ep is.
To answer this, we reason in the following way:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.419447">
1. On the syntagmatic plane,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98333925">
O since f, is in relation with f, (the relation Rf
being supposed valid),
O since ep is in relation with eq (the relation
Re being valid),
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.709425" genericHeader="method">
2. on the paradigmatic plane,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935416666667">
O since j; is the translation of eq (supposing
the alignment relation P2 is valid),
then we conclude, by analogy, that the alignment
relation P1 is also valid, in other words that f and ep
are translations of each other in this context. This
degree of validity will be stronger as the dependency
relations It1 and It, are close (identical or compatible)
and as P1 and P2 get close to identity.
We will call strong resolution one that confirms an
existing potential alignment, and weak resolution one
that negates an existing alignment or that creates a
new alignment.

VIII. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855333333334">
The algorithm presented here subdivides into three
phases. The first phase is construction: based on
lexical proximity, we try to establish all the possible
links between the words of the two sentences being
aligned. The second phase is one of elimination: using
syntactic dependencies we attempt to resolve
ambiguous attachments and to undo nonambiguous but
erroneous attachments. The third step is again one of
construction: we attempt to reduce silence.
We repeat that even human solutions to alignments are
subject to wide variations, which shows the difficulty
of problem.
