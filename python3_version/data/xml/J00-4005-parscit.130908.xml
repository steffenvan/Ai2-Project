in this paper, it is argued that &amp;quot;coreference&amp;quot; annotations, as performed in the MUC community
for example, go well beyond annotation of the relation of coreference proper. As a result, it is not
always clear what semantic relation these annotations are encoding. The paper discusses a number
of problems with these annotations and concludes that rethinking of the coreference task is needed
before the task is expanded. In particular, it suggests a division of labor whereby annotation of the
coreference relation proper is separated from other tasks such as annotation of bound anaphora
and of the relation between a subject and a predicative NP.

Various practical tasks requiring language technology including, for example, infor-
mation extraction and text summarization, can be performed more reliably if it is
possible to automatically find parts of the text containing information about a given
topic. For example, if a text summarizer has to select the most important informa-
tion, in a given text, about the 1984 Wall Street crash, then the summarization task
is greatly helped if a program can automatically spot all the clauses in the text that
contain information about this crash. To evaluate a program of this kind, extensive
language corpora have been prepared in which human readers have annotated what
has been called the coreference relation. These annotated corpora are then used as a
gold standard against which the program&apos;s achievements can be compared. The re-
lation of coreference has been defined as holding between two noun phrases if they
&amp;quot;refer to the same entity&amp;quot; (Hirschman et al. 1997). More precisely, let us assume that
ai and a2 are occurrences of noun phrases (NPs) and let us assume that both have
a unique referent in the context in which they occur (i.e., their context in the corpus
makes them unambiguous). Under these assumptions we can use a functional nota-
tion, e.g. Referent(a), as short for &amp;quot;the entity referred to by a&amp;quot; and define (suppressing
the role of context):

al and a2 corefer if and only if Referent(ai) = Referent(a2).
Putting it simply: to determine whether ai and a2 corefer, first determine Referent(a1)
and Referent(a2), then see if they are equal.
Ideally, of course, one would like to annotate many other semantic relations that
hold between parts of a text, because they are also relevant for text interpretation. One
candidate is the relation of anaphora. Loosely speaking—and glossing over some dif-
ficulties regarding the precise delimitation of anaphora (Sidner 1979; Partee 1989; van

Deemter 1992)—an NP al is said to take an NP a2 as its anaphoric antecedent if and
only if al depends on az for its interpretation (e.g., Kamp and Reyle 1993). It follows
that anaphora and coreference are different things. Coreference, for example, is an
equivalence relation; anaphora, by contrast, is irreflexive, nonsymmetrical, and non-
transitive. Secondly, anaphora, as it has just been defined, implies context-sensitivity
of interpretation, and this is not true for coreference. For example, a name (President
W. J. Clinton) and a description (Hillary Rodham&apos;s husband) can corefer without either
of the two depending on the other for its interpretation. Anaphoric and coreferential
relations can coincide, of course, but not all coreferential relations are anaphoric, nor
are all anaphoric relations coreferential. (An example of the latter is bound anaphora,
see Section 2.1.)
Coreference annotation has been a focus of the Sixth and Seventh Message Under-
standing Conferences (MUC-6, MUC-7) and various other annotation exercises (e.g.,
Passoneau 1997; Garside, Leech, and McEnery 1997; Davies et al. 1998; Poesio 2000). In
this squib, we intend to point at some fundamental problems with many of these an-
notation exercises, which are caused by a failure to distinguish properly between coref-
erence, anaphora, and other, related phenomena. Because the MUC project is the best-
known example of coreference annotation, on which much subsequent work is based,
and because of the public availability of the MUC Task Definition (TD, Hirschman
and Chinchor 11997D, we will focus on MUC.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90361775">
Four criteria are listed for the MUC TD, in order of their priority (Hirschman and
Chinchor 1997):
1. The MUC information extraction tasks should be supported by the
annotations
2. Good (defined as ca. 95%) interarmotator agreement should be achievable
3. It should be possible to annotate texts quickly and cheaply
4. A corpus should be created that can be used as a tool for linguists
outside MIX.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999651125">
The TD makes it clear that the annotation task has been simplified in a number of
ways. For example, only NPs were annotated. Such eminently sensible simplifica-
tions notwithstanding, we will argue that the above-mentioned criteria have not been
achieved and that a rethinking of the coreference annotation enterprise is in order be-
fore it ventures into new domains involving speech, noisy data, etc. (see for example,
Bagga, Baldwin, and Shelton 119991), or before it extends the relation of coreference
to cover whole/part and class/instance relations (e.g. Popescu-Belis 1998; Hirschman
and Chinchor 1997).

In this section, some unclarities and inconsistencies will be discussed that we found

to apply coreference annotation to nonreferring NPs and bound anaphora, and we
will argue that this tendency is problematic. In Section 2.2, we will argue that existing

establishing coreference relations between them, showing that this separation is hard

2.1 Annotating Nonreferring NPs and Bound Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999694642857143">
The notion of reference is common to a broad variety of semantic theories (see Gamut
119911, Chapter 1, for discussion). When speakers/writers use an NP to refer to an
object or a set of objects, they try to single out the entity uniquely. Thus, when someone
utters the NE the tenant of the house, the speaker may aim to single out a unique person,
say Mr. X. Even when this is the case (i.e., the NP is used referentially rather than
attributively1), the notion of referring has its problems. For example, the speaker may
be mistaken in her belief that Mr. X is the tenant of the house (Donnellan 1966). In
such cases it is unclear who is being referred to. Such problems notwithstanding, work
on coreference annotation has usually taken the notion of reference for granted, on the
assumption that clear cases, where the referent of an NP is clearly defined, outnumber
the problematic ones, at least in some important types of discourse.
Let us, for now, buy into the assumption that reference is a straightforward notion.
Then, following Bach (1987) (especially Sections 3.2 and 12.2), for example, one thing
that is clear about reference is that some NPs do not refer. When someone says
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.763345">
(1) a. No solution emerged from our discussions, or
b. Whenever a solution emerged, we embraced it,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999724117647059">
the solution NPs do not refer to any single solution, nor to any definite set of solutions.
Most theorists would agree that they do not have a referent. Nonreferring NPs can
enter anaphoric relations. (For example, the NP a solution is the (bound) anaphoric
antecedent to it in (1b).) But if they do not refer, the coreference relation as defined in
Section 1 (which presupposes that Referent(cli) and Referent(a2) are defined) is not ap-
plicable to them. Even so, the MUC TD asks annotators to treat them as if it was appli-
cable. It acknowledges (page 10) that &amp;quot;one may argue that [a bound anaphor and its an-
tecedent] are not coreferential in the usual sense,&amp;quot; but falls short of explaining explicitly
what types of anaphora are to be annotated and how (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997).2
The annotation of bound anaphora merits some further elaboration. Consider, for
example, quantifying NPs such as Every TV network (or, even more problematic, Most
computational linguists [Hirschman and Chinchor 19971, see also Section 3). If Every TV
network refers at all, then presumably it refers to the set of all TV networks (relevant to a
certain domain). The TD, however, asks annotators to let Every TV network corefer with
its in (1c). According to the definition of coreference, this means that Referent(Every
TV network) = Referent(its) so that Referent(its) is the set of all TV networks, predicting
incorrectly that (1c) means (lc&apos;):

1 See Donnellan (1966). For an interesting class of attributively used NPs, see van der Sandt (1992);
examples include hypotheticals like If this house has a tenant then the tenant is probably Dutch, where one
might ask whether a tenant and The tenant corefer.
2 Sometimes the term &amp;quot;cospecification&amp;quot; has been employed to replace coreference (e.g. Siclner 1983;
Davies et al. 1998). It is unclear, however, whether a bound anaphor and its antecedent cospecify, or
how the notion should be applied to intensional constructions (Section 2.2).

(Incidentally, coreference and anaphora are not only different; they are also extremely
difficult to combine into a proper equivalence relationship that allows us to recognize
different clauses as being &amp;quot;about the same thing.&amp;quot; Consider, for example, the relation,
say R, which holds between NV]. and NP2 if and only if
either NPi and NP2 corefer (in the sense of the definition in Section 1)
or NPi is an anaphoric antecedent of NP2
or NP2 is an anaphoric antecedent of NP1
Note that R is not an equivalence relation. The subject of (1c), for example, can corefer
with a plural pronoun in the next sentence, e.g., (...) They are now required to do this,
but They and it (in (1c)) do not stand in the relation R.)
Predicative NPs are another category of NPs whose referentiality is problematic
and yet the MUC TD instructs annotators to let them corefer with other NPs. In (2a)
and (2b), for example, the predicative NP the/a president of DD cannot be replaced
by the proper name Higgins without changing the meaning of the sentence beyond
recognition, indicating that the relation between the two NPs must be something other
than coreference:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9520665">
(2) a. Higgins was/became the/a president of DD
b. Higgins, once the president of DD, is now a humble university lecturer
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832692307692">
We will have more to say about predicative NPs in the next section.
To sum up, MUC&apos;s annotators have been instructed to let NPs of all major classes
(definite, quantificational, and indefinite) &amp;quot;corefer&amp;quot; liberally with other NPs, even when
it is far from clear that the NPs in question have been used referentially. As a result,
the relation actually annotated in MUC—henceforth called the IDENT relation, fol-
lowing Hirschman and Chinchor (1997)—must be distinguished from the coreference
relation. The TD admits that certain instructions may be incompatible with the defini-
tion of coreference but no reason is given for these incompatibilities and no intuitive
motivation for the relation IDENT is offered. As a result, the annotator is left with a
long series of instructions that fail to be held together by a common rationale.
Remedy. Go back to basics: start from a definition of coreference and write a TD that
implements the definition. We suggest that it is not until this has been done success-
fully that extensions into the area of bound anaphora become a risk worth taking.

2.2 Problems of Intensionality and Predication
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999486666666667">
Problems posed to coreference annotation by intensionality (Hirschman et al. 1997)
have motivated considerable complications in the TD. Consider Section 6.4, which
discusses the implications of &amp;quot;change over time.&amp;quot; The TD says that &amp;quot;two rnarkables
should be recorded as coreferential if the text asserts them to be coreferential at ANY
TIME&amp;quot; (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997, page 11). Thus, for example, the TD points out
that in a case like

and (3) president of Dreamy Detergents as coreferential. (Similar strategies seem to be

adopted by most practitioners of coreference annotation, e.g., Cristea et al. [1999]). But
since coreference is generally agreed to be a equivalence relation (e.g. Hirschman and
Chinchor 1997, Section 1.3), this implies that the sales director of Sudsy Soaps and the
president of Dreamy Detergents are the same person. Clearly, this cannot be right.
Luckily, there are other parts of the same TD that do a better job of applying the
notion of coreference to sentences involving change over time. Consider, for example,
Section 1.3, where the sentence the stock price fell from $4.02 to $3.85 is discussed. Here
annotators are asked to consider the stock price as standing in the IDENT relation with
$3.85 but not with $4.02, because $3.85 is &amp;quot;the more recent value&amp;quot; (p. 3). (If both
coreferred with the stock price, it would have followed that $4.02 and $3.85 are equal.)
This solution, however, is still problematic. What, for instance, if the price continues
to fall?
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8279345">
(4) a. The stock price fell from $4.02 to $3.85;
b. Later that day, it fell to an even lower value, at $3.82.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988426409090909">
Does the annotator have to go back to (4a), deciding that $3.82 is an even more recent
value and the stock price does not stand in the IDENT relation with $3.85 after all?
Remedy. At least three different strategies are conceivable. Perhaps most obviously,
one might decide that coreference between a functional description like those in (3) or
(4) and an NP denoting a value requires this value to be the present (rather than the
most recent) value of the function. But, the text does not always say what the present
value is. Moreover, functional descriptions do not always pertain to the present. In
Last year, the president resigned, for example, the subject refers to last year&apos;s president, and
consequently, it does not corefer with NPs referring to the present president. A second
strategy, consistent with Dowty, Wall, and Peters (1981, Appendix iii) might be to say
that The stock price refers only to a Montague-type individual concept, that is, a function
from times to numbers. It would follow that The stock price does not corefer with either
$4.02 or $3.85 and no problem would arise. Analogously, president of Dreamy Detergents,
in (3) above, where it is used predicatively, might denote an individual concept rather
than an individual. If the next sentence goes on to say He died within a week, then he
is coreferential with Henry Higgins; if, instead, the text proceeds This is an influential
position, but the pay is lousy, then This is coreferential with president of Dreamy Detergents.
If both these analyses prove to be too complex to be used in large-scale annotation
exercises, one might have to take the point of view that such descriptions simply do
not refer. This would amount to a third strategy, which excludes these descriptions
from entering coreference relations altogether and leaving their analysis to the other
tasks.

2.3 What&apos;s Markable?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917888888889">
It has been proposed that annotation can profitably be broken down into two more
manageable steps: annotation of markables (step 1) is to be carried out before (step 2)
partitioning the set of markables into equivalence classes of coreferring elements (e.g.,
Hirschman and Chinchor 1997). It turns out, however, that a strict distinction between
the two steps is difficult to maintain, because, in principle, almost anything is mark-
able. In the MUC-7 TD, this is sensibly acknowledged by letting annotators mark up
certain elements only if they corefer with an existing markable: these include conjuncts
and prenominal modifiers. In the following example, the first occurrence of aluminum
is only considered to be markable because it corefers with the occurrence of this noun

(5) The price of aluminum siding has steadily increased, as the market for

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9922436">
In other words: coreference (step 2) helps to determine what the markables are (step 1).
Finding all the NPs that might participate in coreference becomes even harder if the
annotation scheme is extended to cover event coreference (noted in the &amp;quot;wish list&amp;quot; in
Section 1.4 of the TD) since it is often extremely difficult to determine which events
can serve as antecedents (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997):

clean water and tell your doctor. (ABP1, 1997)

<bodyText confidence="0.999655857142857">
Examples of this kind suggest that one markable (e.g., an event) can give rise to
another (e.g., the negation of the event). A complication of a similarly algebraic flavor
arises if &amp;quot;discontinuous elements, including conjoined elements&amp;quot; are covered, as when
a plural pronoun corefers with a combination of previously occurring NPs (Hirschman
and Chirtchor 1997, section 1.4; see Garside, Leech, and McEriery 11997] for a proposal).
Note especially that annotators would have to be on guard for the possibility of different
combinations of markables coreferring to each other. A corpus, for example, can easily
contain NPs A, B, C, and D for which Referent(A) U Referent(B) = Referent(C) U
Referent(D). Even assuming that each of A,B,C, and D has been properly identified
as a markable during step 1, this is little guarantee that annotators of step 2 will realize
the complex coreference relation between the combination of A and B and that of C
and D. (Recall that coreference relations are to be annotated even in the absence of an
anaphoric relationship.) The number of possible combinations of markables (some 2&apos;
when there are n markables) will often be too large to handle.
Remedy. One alternative is to have a first pass where only referring expressions that
look like anaphors are marked up, such as pronouns and definite NPs. Subsequent
passes would look for antecedents for these expressions and link coreferring elements.
An intermediate approach would be to mark up a core set of referring expressions on
the first pass, allowing for further referring expressions to be identified on subsequent
passes if this is necessary to resolve coreference. The extent to which each strategy
would contribute to accuracy and speed of annotation remains to be determined.

3. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890375">
Current &amp;quot;coreference&amp;quot; annotation practice, as exemplified by MUC, has overextended
itself, mixing elements of genuine coreference with elements of anaphora and predica-
tion in unclear and sometimes contradictory ways. As a result, the annotated corpus
emerging from MUC is unlikely to be as useful for the computational linguistics re-
search community as one might hope (Criterion 4, see Section 1), the more so because
generalization to other domains is bound to make problems worse. In many domains,
for example, other sources of intensionality than change over time occur prominently.
An example is epistemic modality:

van Deemter and Kibble On Coreferring
The relation between Henry Higgins and the man you have talked to is analogous to that
between Henry Higgins and sales director of Sudsy Soaps in (3), with possible worlds
taking the place of points in time: the two NPs refer to the same individual in some
possible worlds only (see Groenendijk, Stokhof, and Veltman [1996] for relevant theo-
retical work). Modality, of course, interacts with tense (as in Henry Higgins might become
the president of Dreamy Detergents), leading to further complications.
The MUC TD has addressed many of the difficult problems in the area of reference
and coreference, but if its success is judged by the criteria in Hirschman and Chinchor
(1997) (see Introduction), the results are mixed at best. Criterion 4 has been discussed
above. Concerning Criterion 3, it appears doubtful that the present task definition can
be applied &amp;quot;quickly and cheaply.&amp;quot; Hirschman et al. (1997), when discussing this issue,
note that interannotator agreement, at the time of writing, was in the low eighties.
This figure, which falls markedly short of the 95% required by Criterion 2, does not
seem to have improved substantially since (Breck Baldwin, personal communication).
Concerning Criterion 1, finally, it has been observed that the figures for recall in the
MUC information extraction algorithm are rather discouraging (Appelt 1998). The
material in Section 2 suggests that this relative lack of success is no accident and that
unclarities in the TD are to blame. Repairs are not always easy to find. Given this
situation, we suggest that a rethinking of the coreference task is required.
Firstly, one needs a consistent story of what reference and coreference are taken
to be. Theoretical work on reference does not show a consensus on some crucial ques-
tions in this area (Bach 1987; Kronfeld and Roberts 1998). Different answers have been
suggested, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, one might
identify the notion of a referring NP with that of a semantically definite NP in the sense
of Barwise and Cooper (1981).3 This would include proper names, extensional definite
descriptions, universally quantified NPs, and specifically used indefinites (e.g., a com-
pany whose name is withheld), but it would exclude nonspecifically used indefinites such
as at least n companies, most computational linguists. A more liberal approach along the
lines of Kamp and Reyle (1993, Chapter 4), would predict that a quantifying NP such
as the subject of Most computational linguists use a parser refers to the set of those com-
putational linguists who use a parser: the VP helps to determine the referent of the NP.
The first approach would make annotation easier to perform and the results would be
likely to be more reliable as a result, but it would feed less information into the infor-
mation extraction task. Trade-offs of this kind are unavoidable, and experimentation
will be required to determine which option provides the best results.
Secondly, we suggest a further division of labor whereby those phenomena that
are no longer accounted for in the new TD are covered by other tasks (Kibble and
van Deemter 2000). For example, the two NPs Henry Higgins and president of Sudsy
Soaps (example (3)) do not corefer, and the relation between them should be irrelevant
to coreference annotation. If it is imperative that information about Henry&apos;s previous
jobs be saved for posterity then some other annotation task has to be defined, with
its own very different TD, involving the notion of individuals having properties at
certain times or intervals only. Something analogous is true for the annotation of
bound anaphora.
The issue under discussion illustrates a more general point. It is now widely
agreed that linguistic theorizing is sometimes insufficiently informed by observational
data. Conversely, we would like to submit that corpus-based research is sometimes

more collaboration between theoretical and corpus-based linguists in this area. This

As a result, it is not always clear what semantic relation these annotations are encoding. The paper discusses a number of problems with these annotations and concludes that rethinking of the coreference task is needed before the task is expanded. In particular, it suggests a division of labor whereby annotation of the coreference relation proper is separated from other tasks such as annotation of bound anaphora and of the relation between a subject and a predicative NP.</abstract>

(1997), when discussing this issue, note that interannotator agreement, at the time of writing, was in the low eighties. This figure, which falls markedly short of the 95% required by Criterion 2, does not seem to have improved substantially since (Breck Baldwin, personal communication). Concerning Criterion 1, finally, it has been observed that the figures for recall in the MUC information extraction algorithm are rather discouraging (Appelt 1998). The material in Section 2 suggests that this relative lack of success is no accident and that unclarities in the TD are to blame. Repairs are not always easy to find.

For example, the speaker may be mistaken in her belief that Mr. X is the tenant of the house (Donnellan 1966). In such cases it is unclear who is being referred to. Such problems notwithstanding, work on coreference annotation has usually taken the notion of reference for granted, on the assumption that clear cases, where the referent of an NP is clearly defined, outnumber the problematic ones, at least in some important types of discourse. Let us, for now, buy into the assumption that reference is a straightforward notion. Then, following Bach (1987) (especially Sections 3.2 and 12.2), for example, one thing that is clear about reference is that some NPs do not refer. When someone says (1) a. No solution emerged from our discussions, or b. Whenever a solution emerged, we embraced it, the solution NPs do not refer to any single solution, nor to any definite set of solutions. Most theorists would agree that they do not have a referent. Nonreferring NPs can enter anaphoric relations. (For example, the NP a solution is the (bound) anaphoric antecedent to it in (1b).)

Anaphoric and coreferential relations can coincide, of course, but not all coreferential relations are anaphoric, nor are all anaphoric relations coreferential. (An example of the latter is bound anaphora, see Section 2.1.) Coreference annotation has been a focus of the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-6, MUC-7) and various other annotation exercises (e.g., Passoneau 1997; Garside, Leech, and McEnery 1997; Davies et al. 1998; Poesio 2000). In this squib, we intend to point at some fundamental problems with many of these annotation exercises, which are caused by a failure to distinguish properly between coreference, anaphora, and other, related phenomena.

When speakers/writers use an NP to refer to an object or a set of objects, they try to single out the entity uniquely. Thus, when someone utters the NE the tenant of the house, the speaker may aim to single out a unique person, say Mr. X. Even when this is the case (i.e., the NP is used referentially rather than attributively1), the notion of referring has its problems. For example, the speaker may be mistaken in her belief that Mr. X is the tenant of the house (Donnellan 1966). In such cases it is unclear who is being referred to.

Good (defined as ca. 95%) interarmotator agreement should be achievable 3. It should be possible to annotate texts quickly and cheaply 4. A corpus should be created that can be used as a tool for linguists outside MIX. The TD makes it clear that the annotation task has been simplified in a number of ways.

(For example, the NP a solution is the (bound) anaphoric antecedent to it in (1b).) But if they do not refer, the coreference relation as defined in Section 1 (which presupposes that Referent(cli) and Referent(a2) are defined) is not applicable to them. Even so, the MUC TD asks annotators to treat them as if it was applicable. It acknowledges (page 10) that &amp;quot;one may argue that [a bound anaphor and its antecedent] are not coreferential in the usual sense,&amp;quot; but falls short of explaining explicitly what types of anaphora are to be annotated and how (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997).2 The annotation of bound anaphora merits some further elaboration. Consider, for example, quantifying NPs such as Every TV network (or, even more problematic, Most computational linguists [Hirschman and Chinchor 19971, see also Section 3). If Every TV network refers at all, then presumably it refers to the set of all TV networks (relevant to a certain domain).

As a result, the relation actually annotated in MUC—henceforth called the IDENT relation, following Hirschman and Chinchor (1997)—must be distinguished from the coreference relation. The TD admits that certain instructions may be incompatible with the definition of coreference but no reason is given for these incompatibilities and no intuitive motivation for the relation IDENT is offered. As a result, the annotator is left with a long series of instructions that fail to be held together by a common rationale. Remedy.

(Similar strategies seem to be 632 van Deemter and Kibble On Coreferring adopted by most practitioners of coreference annotation, e.g., Cristea et al. [1999]). But since coreference is generally agreed to be a equivalence relation (e.g. Hirschman and Chinchor 1997, Section 1.3), this implies that the sales director of Sudsy Soaps and the president of Dreamy Detergents are the same person. Clearly, this cannot be right. Luckily, there are other parts of the same TD that do a better job of applying the notion of coreference to sentences involving change over time. Consider, for example, Section 1.3, where the sentence the stock price fell from $4.02 to $3.85 is discussed. Here annotators are asked to consider the stock price as standing in the IDENT relation with $3.85 but not with $4.02, because $3.85 is &amp;quot;the more recent value&amp;quot; (p. 3). (If both coreferr</context>

This would amount to a third strategy, which excludes these descriptions from entering coreference relations altogether and leaving their analysis to the other tasks. 2.3 What&apos;s Markable? It has been proposed that annotation can profitably be broken down into two more manageable steps: annotation of markables (step 1) is to be carried out before (step 2) partitioning the set of markables into equivalence classes of coreferring elements (e.g., Hirschman and Chinchor 1997). It turns out, however, that a strict distinction between the two steps is difficult to maintain, because, in principle, almost anything is markable. In the MUC-7 TD, this is sensibly acknowledged by letting annotators mark up certain elements only if they corefer with an existing markable: these include conjuncts and prenominal modifiers. In the following example, the first occurrence of aluminum is only considered to be markable because it corefers with the occurrence of this noun 633 Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 4 as a bare NP in the second clause. (5) The price of aluminum </context>

Modality, of course, interacts with tense (as in Henry Higgins might become the president of Dreamy Detergents), leading to further complications. The MUC TD has addressed many of the difficult problems in the area of reference and coreference, but if its success is judged by the criteria in Hirschman and Chinchor (1997) (see Introduction), the results are mixed at best. Criterion 4 has been discussed above. Concerning Criterion 3, it appears doubtful that the present task definition can be applied &amp;quot;quickly and cheaply.&amp;quot; Hirschman et al.

To evaluate a program of this kind, extensive language corpora have been prepared in which human readers have annotated what has been called the coreference relation. These annotated corpora are then used as a gold standard against which the program&apos;s achievements can be compared. The relation of coreference has been defined as holding between two noun phrases if they &amp;quot;refer to the same entity&amp;quot; (Hirschman et al. 1997). More precisely, let us assume that ai and a2 are occurrences of noun phrases (NPs) and let us assume that both have a unique referent in the context in which they occur (i.e., their context in the corpus makes them unambiguous). Under these assumptions we can use a functional notation, e.g. Referent(a), as short for &amp;quot;the entity referred to by a&amp;quot; and define (suppressing the role of context): Definition al and a2 corefer if and only if Referent(ai) = Referent(a2).

As a result, the annotator is left with a long series of instructions that fail to be held together by a common rationale. Remedy. Go back to basics: start from a definition of coreference and write a TD that implements the definition. We suggest that it is not until this has been done successfully that extensions into the area of bound anaphora become a risk worth taking. 2.2 Problems of Intensionality and Predication Problems posed to coreference annotation by intensionality (Hirschman et al. 1997) have motivated considerable complications in the TD. Consider Section 6.4, which discusses the implications of &amp;quot;change over time.&amp;quot; The TD says that &amp;quot;two rnarkables should be recorded as coreferential if the text asserts them to be coreferential at ANY TIME&amp;quot; (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997, page 11).

The TD makes it clear that the annotation task has been simplified in a number of ways. For example, only NPs were annotated. Such eminently sensible simplifications notwithstanding, we will argue that the above-mentioned criteria have not been achieved and that a rethinking of the coreference annotation enterprise is in order before it ventures into new domains involving speech, noisy data, etc. (see for example, Bagga, Baldwin, and Shelton 119991), or before it extends the relation of coreference to cover whole/part and class/instance relations (e.g. Popescu-Belis 1998; Hirschman and Chinchor 1997). 2. Problems with Coreference Annotation In this section, some unclarities and inconsistencies will be discussed that we found in the literature on coreference annotation, and which appear to stem from confusion about what reference and coreference are. In Section 2.1, we will explore the tendency to apply coreference annotation to nonreferring NPs and bound anaphora, and we will argue that this tendency is problematic.
