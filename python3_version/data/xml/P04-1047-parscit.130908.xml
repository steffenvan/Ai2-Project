In this paper we present a methodology for ex-
tracting subcategorisation frames based on an
automatic LFG f-structure annotation algorithm
for the Penn-II Treebank. We extract abstract
syntactic function-based subcategorisation frames
(LFG semantic forms), traditional CFG category-
based subcategorisation frames as well as mixed
function/category-based frames, with or without
preposition information for obliques and particle in-
formation for particle verbs. Our approach does
not predefine frames, associates probabilities with
frames conditional on the lemma, distinguishes be-
tween active and passive frames, and fully reflects
the effects of long-distance dependencies in the
source data structures. We extract 3586 verb lem-
mas, 14348 semantic form types (an average of 4
per lemma) with 577 frame types. We present a
large-scale evaluation of the complete set of forms
extracted against the full COMLEX resource.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998085483871">
Lexical resources are crucial in the construction
of wide-coverage computational systems based on
modern syntactic theories (e.g. LFG, HPSG, CCG,
LTAG etc.). However, as manual construction of
such lexical resources is time-consuming, error-
prone, expensive and rarely ever complete, it is of-
ten the case that limitations of NLP systems based
on lexicalised approaches are due to bottlenecks in
the lexicon component.
Given this, research on automating lexical acqui-
sition for lexically-based NLP systems is a partic-
ularly important issue. In this paper we present an
approach to automating subcategorisation frame ac-
quisition for LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) i.e.
grammatical function-based systems. LFG has two
levels of structural representation: c(onstituent)-
structure, and f(unctional)-structure. LFG differ-
entiates between governable (argument) and non-
governable (adjunct) grammatical functions. Sub-
categorisation requirements are enforced through
semantic forms specifying the governable grammat-
ical functions required by a particular predicate (e.g.
FOCUS((T SUBJ)(T OBL,,,,,))). Our approach is
based on earlier work on LFG semantic form extrac-
tion (van Genabith et al., 1999) and recent progress
in automatically annotating the Penn-II treebank
with LFG f-structures (Cahill et al., 2004b). De-
pending on the quality of the f-structures, reliable
LFG semantic forms can then be generated quite
simply by recursively reading off the subcategoris-
able grammatical functions for each local pred
value at each level of embedding in the f-structures.
The work reported in (van Genabith et al., 1999)
was small scale (100 trees), proof of concept and
required considerable manual annotation work. In
this paper we show how the extraction process can
be scaled to the complete Wall Street Journal (WSJ)
section of the Penn-II treebank, with about 1 mil-
lion words in 50,000 sentences, based on the au-
tomatic LFG f-structure annotation algorithm de-
scribed in (Cahill et al., 2004b). In addition to ex-
tracting grammatical function-based subcategorisa-
tion frames, we also include the syntactic categories
of the predicate and its subcategorised arguments,
as well as additional details such as the prepositions
required by obliques, and particles accompanying
particle verbs. Our method does not predefine the
frames to be extracted. In contrast to many other
approaches, it discriminates between active and pas-
sive frames, properly reflects long distance depen-
dencies and assigns conditional probabilities to the
semantic forms associated with each predicate.
Section 2 reviews related work in the area of
automatic subcategorisation frame extraction. Our
methodology and its implementation are presented
in Section 3. Section 4 presents the results of our
lexical extraction. In Section 5 we evaluate the
complete extracted lexicon against the COMLEX
resource (MacLeod et al., 1994). To our knowl-
edge, this is the largest evaluation of subcategorisa-
tion frames for English. In Section 6, we conclude
and give suggestions for future work.

Creating a (subcategorisation) lexicon by hand is
time-consuming, error-prone, requires considerable
linguistic expertise and is rarely, if ever, complete.
In addition, a system incorporating a manually con-
structed lexicon cannot easily be adapted to specific
domains. Accordingly, many researchers have at-
tempted to construct lexicons automatically, espe-
cially for English.
(Brent, 1993) relies on local morphosyntactic
cues (such as the -ing suffix, except where such a
word follows a determiner or a preposition other
than to) in the untagged Brown Corpus as proba-
bilistic indicators of six different predefined subcat-
egorisation frames. The frames do not include de-
tails of specific prepositions. (Manning, 1993) ob-
serves that Brent’s recognition technique is a “rather
simplistic and inadequate approach to verb detec-
tion, with a very high error rate”. Manning feeds
the output from a stochastic tagger into a finite state
parser, and applies statistical filtering to the parsing
results. He predefines 19 different subcategorisation
frames, including details of prepositions. Applying
this technique to approx. 4 million words of New
York Times newswire, Manning acquires 4900 sub-
categorisation frames for 3104 verbs, an average of
1.6 per verb. (Ushioda et al., 1993) run a finite state
NP parser on a POS-tagged corpus to calculate the
relative frequency of just six subcategorisation verb
classes. In addition, all prepositional phrases are
treated as adjuncts. For 1565 tokens of 33 selected
verbs, they report an accuracy rate of 83%.
(Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) observe that in the
work of (Brent, 1993), (Manning, 1993) and (Ush-
ioda et al., 1993), “the maximum number of distinct
subcategorization classes recognized is sixteen, and
only Ushioda et al. attempt to derive relative subcat-
egorization frequency for individual predicates”. In
contrast, the system of (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997)
distinguishes 163 verbal subcategorisation classes
by means of a statistical shallow parser, a classifier
of subcategorisation classes, and a priori estimates
of the probability that any verb will be a member
of those classes. More recent work by Korhonen
(2002) on the filtering phase of this approach has
improved results. Korhonen experiments with the
use of linguistic verb classes for obtaining more ac-
curate back-off estimates for use in hypothesis se-
lection. Using this extended approach, the average
results for 45 semantically classified test verbs eval-
uated against hand judgements are precision 87.1%
and recall 71.2%. By comparison, the average re-
sults for 30 verbs not classified semantically are pre-
cision 78.2% and recall 58.7%.
Carroll and Rooth (1998) use a hand-written
head-lexicalised context-free grammar and a text
corpus to compute the probability of particular sub-
categorisation scenarios. The extracted frames do
not contain details of prepositions.
More recently, a number of researchers have
applied similar techniques to derive resources for
other languages, especially German. One of these,
(Schulte im Walde, 2002), induces a computational
subcategorisation lexicon for over 14,000 German
verbs. Using sentences of limited length, she ex-
tracts 38 distinct frame types, which contain max-
imally three arguments each. The frames may op-
tionally contain details of particular prepositional
use. Her evaluation on over 3000 frequently occur-
ring verbs against the German dictionary Duden -
Das Stilw¨orterbuch is similar in scale to ours and is
discussed further in Section 5.
There has also been some work on extracting
subcategorisation details from the Penn Treebank.
(Kinyon and Prolo, 2002) introduce a tool which
uses fine-grained rules to identify the arguments,
including optional arguments, of each verb occur-
rence in the Penn Treebank, along with their syn-
tactic functions. They manually examined the 150+
possible sequences of tags, both functional and cat-
egorial, in Penn-II and determined whether the se-
quence in question denoted a modifier, argument or
optional argument. Arguments were then mapped
to traditional syntactic functions. As they do not in-
clude an evaluation, currently it is impossible to say
how effective this technique is.
(Xia et al., 2000) and (Chen and Vijay-Shanker,
2000) extract lexicalised TAGs from the Penn Tree-
bank. Both techniques implement variations on
the approaches of (Magerman, 1994) and (Collins,
1997) for the purpose of differentiating between
complement and adjunct. In the case of (Xia et al.,
2000), invalid elementary trees produced as a result
of annotation errors in the treebank are filtered out
using linguistic heuristics.
(Hockenmaier et al., 2002) outline a method for
the automatic extraction of a large syntactic CCG
lexicon from Penn-II. For each tree, the algorithm
annotates the nodes with CCG categories in a top-
down recursive manner. In order to examine the
coverage of the extracted lexicon in a manner simi-
lar to (Xia et al., 2000), (Hockenmaier et al., 2002)
compared the reference lexicon acquired from Sec-
tions 02-21 with a test lexicon extracted from Sec-
tion 23 of the WSJ. It was found that the reference
CCG lexicon contained 95.09% of the entries in the
test lexicon, while 94.03% of the entries in the test
TAG lexicon also occurred in the reference lexicon.
Both approaches involve extensive correction and
clean-up of the treebank prior to lexical extraction.

3 Our Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99980534">
The first step in the application of our methodology
is the production of a treebank annotated with LFG
f-structure information. F-structures are feature
structures which represent abstract syntactic infor-
mation, approximating to basic predicate-argument-
modifier structures. We utilise the automatic anno-
tation algorithm of (Cahill et al., 2004b) to derive
a version of Penn-II where each node in each tree
is annotated with an LFG functional annotation (i.e.
an attribute value structure equation). Trees are tra-
versed top-down, and annotation is driven by cate-
gorial, basic configurational, trace and Penn-II func-
tional tag information in local subtrees of mostly
depth one (i.e. CFG rules). The annotation proce-
dure is dependent on locating the head daughter, for
which the scheme of (Magerman, 1994) with some
changes and amendments is used. The head is anno-
tated with the LFG equation T=J. Linguistic gen-
eralisations are provided over the left (the prefix)
and the right (suffix) context of the head for each
syntactic category occurring as the mother node of
such heads. To give a simple example, the rightmost
NP to the left of a VP head under an S is likely to
be its subject (T SUBJ =J), while the leftmost NP
to the right of the V head of a VP is most proba-
bly its object (T OBJ =J). (Cahill et al., 2004b)
provide four sets of annotation principles, one for
non-coordinate configurations, one for coordinate
configurations, one for traces (long distance depen-
dencies) and a final ‘catch all and clean up’ phase.
Distinguishing between argument and adjunct is an
inherent step in the automatic assignment of func-
tional annotations.
The satisfactory treatment of long distance de-
pendencies by the annotation algorithm is impera-
tive for the extraction of accurate semantic forms.
The Penn Treebank employs a rich arsenal of traces
and empty productions (nodes which do not re-
alise any lexical material) to co-index displaced ma-
terial with the position where it should be inter-
preted semantically. The algorithm of (Cahill et
al., 2004b) translates the traces into corresponding
re-entrancies in the f-structure representation (Fig-
ure 1). Passive movement is also captured and ex-
pressed at f-structure level using a passive:+ an-
notation. Once a treebank tree is annotated with
feature structure equations by the annotation algo-
rithm, the equations are collected and passed to a
constraint solver which produces the f-structures.

tic forms extracted by our method, we must first
ensure the quality of the f-structure annotations.
(Cahill et al., 2004b) measure annotation quality
in terms of precision and recall against manually
constructed, gold-standard f-structures for 105 ran-
domly selected trees from section 23 of the WSJ
section of Penn-II. The algorithm currently achieves
an F-score of 96.3% for complete f-structures and
93.6% for preds-only f-structures.1
Our semantic form extraction methodology is
based on the procedure of (van Genabith et al.,
1999): For each f-structure generated, for each
level of embedding we determine the local PRED
value and collect the subcategorisable grammat-
ical functions present at that level of embed-
ding. Consider the f-structure in Figure 1. From
this we recursively extract the following non-
empty semantic forms: say([subj,comp]),
sign([subj,obj]). In effect, in both (van
Genabith et al., 1999) and our approach seman-
tic forms are reverse engineered from automatically
generated f-structures for treebank trees. We ex-
tract the following subcategorisable syntactic func-
tions: SUBJ, OBJ, OBJ2, OBLpTep, OBL2pTep, COMP,
XCOMP and PART. Adjuncts (e.g. ADJ, APP etc)
are not included in the semantic forms. PART
is not a syntactic function in the strict sense but
we capture the relevant co-occurrence patterns of
verbs and particles in the semantic forms. Just
as OBL includes the prepositional head of the PP,
PART includes the actual particle which occurs e.g.
add([subj,obj,part:up]).
In the work presented here we substantially ex-
tend the approach of (van Genabith et al., 1999) as

regards coverage, granularity and evaluation: First,
we scale the approach of (van Genabith et al., 1999)
which was proof of concept on 100 trees to the full
WSJ section of the Penn-II Treebank. Second, our
approach fully reflects long distance dependencies,
indicated in terms of traces in the Penn-II Tree-
bank and corresponding re-entrancies at f-structure.
Third, in addition to abstract syntactic function-
based subcategorisation frames we compute frames
for syntactic function-CFG category pairs, both for
the verbal heads and their arguments and also gen-
erate pure CFG-based subcat frames. Fourth, our
method differentiates between frames captured for
active or passive constructions. Fifth, our method
associates conditional probabilities with frames.
In contrast to much of the work reviewed in the
previous section, our system is able to produce sur-
face syntactic as well as abstract functional subcat-
egorisation details. To incorporate CFG details into
the extracted semantic forms, we add an extra fea-
ture to the generated f-structures, the value of which
is the syntactic category of the pred at each level
of embedding. Exploiting this information, the ex-
tracted semantic form for the verb sign looks as fol-
lows: sign(v,[subj(np),obj(np)]).
We have also extended the algorithm to deal with
passive voice and its effect on subcategorisation be-
haviour. Consider Figure 2: not taking voice into
account, the algorithm extracts an intransitive frame
outlaw([subj]) for the transitive outlaw. To
correct this, the extraction algorithm uses the fea-
ture value pair passive:+, which appears in the
f-structure at the level of embedding of the verb in
question, to mark that predicate as occurring in the
passive: outlaw([subj],p).
In order to estimate the likelihood of the cooc-
currence of a predicate with a particular argument
list, we compute conditional probabilities for sub-
categorisation frames based on the number of token
occurrences in the corpus. Given a lemma l and an
argument list s, the probability of s given l is esti-
mated as:

<equation confidence="0.996649">
count(l, s)
P(s|l) :=.ni=1 count(l, si)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990428571429">
We use thresholding to filter possible error judge-
ments by our system. Table 1 shows the attested
semantic forms for the verb accept with their as-
sociated conditional probabilities. Note that were
the distinction between active and passive not taken
into account, the intransitive occurrence of accept
would have been assigned an unmerited probability.

The following is a sample entry for the verb

its subcategorisation behaviour. For example,
reimburse can occur with two noun phrases
(NP-NP), a noun phrase and a prepositional phrase
headed by “for” (NP-PP :PVAL (“for”)) or a single
noun phrase (NP). Note that the details of the subject
noun phrase are not included in COMLEX frames.
Each of the complement types which make up the
value of the :SUBC feature is associated with a for-
mal frame definition which looks as follows:
(vp-frame np-np :cs ((np 2)(np 3))
:gs (:subject 1 :obj 2 :obj2 3)
:ex “she asked him his name”)
The value of the :cs feature is the constituent struc-
ture of the subcategorisation frame, which lists the
syntactic CF-PSG constituents in sequence. The
value of the :gs feature is the grammatical struc-
ture which indicates the functional role played by
each of the CF-PSG constituents. The elements of
the constituent structure are indexed, and referenced
in the :gs field. This mapping between constituent
structure and functional structure makes the infor-
mation contained in COMLEX suitable as an eval-

We devised a common format for our induced se-

This is summarised in Table 4. COMLEX does
not distinguish between obliques and objects so we
converted Obji to OBLi as required. In addition,
COMLEX does not explicitly differentiate between
COMPs and XCOMPs, but does encode control in-
formation for any Comps which occur, thus allow-
ing us to deduce the distinction automatically. The
manually constructed COMLEX entries provided us
with a gold standard against which we evaluated the
automatically induced frames for the 2992 (active)

We use the computed conditional probabilities to set
a threshold to filter the selection of semantic forms.
As some verbs occur less frequently than others we
felt it was important to use a relative rather than ab-
solute threshold. For a threshold of 1%, we disre-
gard any frames with a conditional probability of
less than or equal to 0.01. We carried out the evalu-
ation in a similar way to (Schulte im Walde, 2002).
The scale of our evaluation is comparable to hers.
This allows us to make tentative comparisons be-
tween our respective results. The figures shown in
Table 5 are the results of three different kinds of
evaluation with the threshold set to 1% and 5%. The
effect of the threshold increase is obvious in that
Precision goes up for each of the experiments while
Recall goes down.
For Exp 1, we excluded prepositional phrases en-
tirely from the comparison, i.e. assumed that PPs
were adjunct material (e.g. [subj,obl:for] becomes
[subj]). Our results are better for Precision than for
Recall compared to Schulte im Walde (op cit.), who
reports Precision of 74.53%, Recall of 69.74% and
an F-score of 72.05%.
Exp 2 includes prepositional phrases but not
parameterised for particular prepositions (e.g.
[subj,obl:for] becomes [subj,obl]). While our fig-
ures for Recall are again lower, our results for
Precision are considerably higher than those of
Schulte im Walde (op cit.) who recorded Preci-
sion of 60.76%, Recall of 63.91% and an F-score
of 62.30%.
For Exp. 3, we used semantic forms which con-
tained details of specific prepositions for any sub-
categorised prepositional phrase. Our Precision fig-
ures are again high (in comparison to 65.52% as

<bodyText confidence="0.999962888888889">
There are a number of possible reasons for our
low recall scores for Experiment 3 in Table 5. It
is a well-documented fact (Briscoe and Carroll,
1997) that subcategorisation frames (and their fre-
quencies) vary across domains. We have extracted
frames from one domain (the WSJ) whereas COM-
LEX was built using examples from the San Jose
Mercury News, the Brown Corpus, several literary
works from the Library of America, scientific ab-
stracts from the U.S. Department of Energy, and
the WSJ. For this reason, it is likely to contain
a greater variety of subcategorisation frames than
our induced lexicon. It is also possible that due
to human error COMLEX contains subcategorisa-
tion frames, the validity of which may be in doubt.
This is due to the fact that the aim of the COMLEX
project was to construct as complete a set of subcat-
egorisation frames as possible, even for infrequent
verbs. Lexicographers were allowed to extrapo-
late from the citations found, a procedure which
is bound to be less certain than the assignment of
frames based entirely on existing examples. Our re-
call figure was particularly low in the case of eval-
uation using details of prepositions (Experiment 3).
This can be accounted for by the fact that COMLEX
errs on the side of overgeneration when it comes to
preposition assignment. This is particularly true of
directional prepositions, a list of 31 of which has
been prepared and is assigned in its entirety by de-
fault to any verb which can potentially appear with
any directional preposition. In a subsequent exper-
iment, we incorporate this list of directional prepo-
sitions by default into our semantic form induction
process in the same way as the creators of COM-
LEX have done. Table 6 shows the results of this
experiment. As expected there is a significant im-

Table 7 presents the results of our evaluation of
the passive semantic forms we extract. It was
carried out for 1422 verbs which occur with pas-
sive frames and are shared by the induced lexicon
and COMLEX. As COMLEX does not provide ex-
plicit passive entries, we applied Lexical Redun-
dancy Rules (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) to auto-
matically convert the active COMLEX frames to
their passive counterparts. For example, the COM-
LEX entry see([subj,obj]) is converted to
see([subj]). The resulting precision is very
high, a slight increase on that for the active frames.
The recall score drops for passive frames (from
54.7% to 29.3%) in a similar way to that for active
frames when prepositional details are included.

<bodyText confidence="0.999514578947369">
As well as evaluating the quality of our extracted
semantic forms, we also examine the rate at which
they are induced. (Charniak, 1996) and (Krotov et
al., 1998) observed that treebank grammars (CFGs
extracted from treebanks) are very large and grow
with the size of the treebank. We were interested in
discovering whether the acquisition of lexical mate-
rial on the same data displays a similar propensity.
Figure 3 displays the accession rates for the seman-
tic forms induced by our method for sections 0–24
of the WSJ section of the Penn-II treebank. When
we do not distinguish semantic forms by category,
all semantic forms together with those for verbs dis-
play smaller accession rates than for the PCFG.
We also examined the coverage of our system in
a similar way to (Hockenmaier et al., 2002). We ex-
tracted a verb-only reference lexicon from Sections
02-21 of the WSJ and subsequently compared this

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995242424242">
We have presented an algorithm and its implementa-
tion for the extraction of semantic forms or subcate-
gorisation frames from the Penn-II Treebank, auto-
matically annotated with LFG f-structures. We have
substantially extended an earlier approach by (van
Genabith et al., 1999). The original approach was
small-scale and ‘proof of concept’. We have scaled
our approach to the entire WSJ Sections of Penn-
II (50,000 trees). Our approach does not predefine
the subcategorisation frames we extract as many
other approaches do. We extract abstract syntac-
tic function-based subcategorisation frames (LFG
semantic forms), traditional CFG category-based
frames as well as mixed function-category based
frames. Unlike many other approaches to subcate-
gorisation frame extraction, our system properly re-
flects the effects of long distance dependencies and
distinguishes between active and passive frames.
Finally our system associates conditional probabil-
ities with the frames we extract. We carried out an
extensive evaluation of the complete induced lexi-
con (not just a sample) against the full COMLEX
resource. To our knowledge, this is the most exten-
sive qualitative evaluation of subcategorisation ex-
traction in English. The only evaluation of a similar
scale is that carried out by (Schulte im Walde, 2002)
for German. Our results compare well with hers.
We believe our semantic forms are fine-grained and
by choosing to evaluate against COMLEX we set
our sights high: COMLEX is considerably more
detailed than the OALD or LDOCE used for other
evaluations.
Currently work is under way to extend the cov-
erage of our acquired lexicons by applying our
methodology to the Penn-III treebank, a more bal-
anced corpus resource with a number of text gen-
res (in addition to the WSJ sections). It is impor-
tant to realise that the induction of lexical resources
is part of a larger project on the acquisition of
wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic, deep unifica-
tion grammar resources from treebanks. We are al-
ready using the extracted semantic forms in parsing
new text with robust, wide-coverage PCFG-based
LFG grammar approximations automatically ac-
quired from the f-structure annotated Penn-II tree-
bank (Cahill et al., 2004a). We hope to be able to
apply our lexical acquisition methodology beyond
existing parse-annotated corpora (Penn-II and Penn-
III): new text is parsed by our PCFG-based LFG ap-
proximations into f-structures from which we can
then extract further semantic forms. The work re-
ported here is part of the core component for boot-
strapping this approach.
As the extraction algorithm we presented derives
semantic forms at f-structure level, it is easily ap-
plied to other, even typologically different, lan-
guages. We have successfully ported our automatic
annotation algorithm to the TIGER Treebank, de-
spite German being a less configurational language
than English, and extracted wide-coverage, proba-
bilistic LFG grammar approximations and lexical
resources for German (Cahill et al., 2003). Cur-
rently, we are migrating the technique to Spanish,
which has freer word order than English and less
morphological marking than German. Preliminary
results have been very encouraging.

We extract abstract syntactic function-based subcategorisation frames (LFG semantic forms), traditional CFG categorybased subcategorisation frames as well as mixed function/category-based frames, with or without preposition information for obliques and particle information for particle verbs. Our approach does not predefine frames, associates probabilities with frames conditional on the lemma, distinguishes between active and passive frames, and fully reflects the effects of long-distance dependencies in the source data structures.

To our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation of subcategorisation frames for English. In Section 6, we conclude and give suggestions for future work. 2 Related Work Creating a (subcategorisation) lexicon by hand is time-consuming, error-prone, requires considerable linguistic expertise and is rarely, if ever, complete. In addition, a system incorporating a manually constructed lexicon cannot easily be adapted to specific domains. Accordingly, many researchers have attempted to construct lexicons automatically, especially for English. (Brent, 1993) relies on local morphosyntactic cues (such as the -ing suffix, except where such a word follows a determiner or a preposition other than to) in the untagged Brown Corpus as probabilistic indicators of six different predefined subcategorisation frames. The frames do not include details of specific prepositions. (Manning, 1993) observes that Brent’s recognition technique is a “rather simplistic and inadequate approach to verb detection, with a very high error rate”.

Applying this technique to approx. 4 million words of New York Times newswire, Manning acquires 4900 subcategorisation frames for 3104 verbs, an average of 1.6 per verb. (Ushioda et al., 1993) run a finite state NP parser on a POS-tagged corpus to calculate the relative frequency of just six subcategorisation verb classes. In addition, all prepositional phrases are treated as adjuncts. For 1565 tokens of 33 selected verbs, they report an accuracy rate of 83%.

In contrast, the system of (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) distinguishes 163 verbal subcategorisation classes by means of a statistical shallow parser, a classifier of subcategorisation classes, and a priori estimates of the probability that any verb will be a member of those classes.

Korhonen experiments with the use of linguistic verb classes for obtaining more accurate back-off estimates for use in hypothesis selection. Using this extended approach, the average results for 45 semantically classified test verbs evaluated against hand judgements are precision 87.1% and recall 71.2%. By comparison, the average results for 30 verbs not classified semantically are precision 78.2% and recall 58.7%.

However, as manual construction of such lexical resources is time-consuming, errorprone, expensive and rarely ever complete, it is often the case that limitations of NLP systems based on lexicalised approaches are due to bottlenecks in the lexicon component. Given this, research on automating lexical acquisition for lexically-based NLP systems is a particularly important issue. In this paper we present an approach to automating subcategorisation frame acquisition for LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) i.e. grammatical function-based systems. LFG has two levels of structural representation: c(onstituent)- structure, and f(unctional)-structure. LFG differentiates between governable (argument) and nongovernable (adjunct) grammatical functions. Subcategorisation requirements are enforced through semantic forms specifying the governable grammatical functions required by a particular predicate (e.g. FOCUS((T SUBJ)(T OBL,,,,,))). Our approach is based on earlier work on LFG semantic form extraction (van Genabith et al., 1999) and recent progress in automatically annotating the Penn-II treebank wi</context>

It was carried out for 1422 verbs which occur with passive frames and are shared by the induced lexicon and COMLEX. As COMLEX does not provide explicit passive entries, we applied Lexical Redundancy Rules (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) to automatically convert the active COMLEX frames to their passive counterparts. For example, the COMLEX entry see([subj,obj]) is converted to see([subj]). The resulting precision is very high, a slight increase on that for the active frames. The recall score drops for passive frames (from 54.7% to 29.3%) in a similar way to that for active frames when prepositional details are included. 5.2 Lexical Accession Rates As well as evaluating the quality of our extracted semantic forms, we also examine the rate at which they are induced.

In contrast to many other approaches, it discriminates between active and passive frames, properly reflects long distance dependencies and assigns conditional probabilities to the semantic forms associated with each predicate. Section 2 reviews related work in the area of automatic subcategorisation frame extraction. Our methodology and its implementation are presented in Section 3. Section 4 presents the results of our lexical extraction. In Section 5 we evaluate the complete extracted lexicon against the COMLEX resource (MacLeod et al., 1994). To our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation of subcategorisation frames for English. In Section 6, we conclude and give suggestions for future work. 2 Related Work Creating a (subcategorisation) lexicon by hand is time-consuming, error-prone, requires considerable linguistic expertise and is rarely, if ever, complete.

Accordingly, many researchers have attempted to construct lexicons automatically, especially for English. (Brent, 1993) relies on local morphosyntactic cues (su</context>

We utilise the automatic annotation algorithm of (Cahill et al., 2004b) to derive a version of Penn-II where each node in each tree is annotated with an LFG functional annotation (i.e. an attribute value structure equation). Trees are traversed top-down, and annotation is driven by categorial, basic configurational, trace and Penn-II functional tag information in local subtrees of mostly depth one (i.e. CFG rules). The annotation procedure is dependent on locating the head daughter, for which the scheme of (Magerman, 1994) with some changes and amendments is used. The head is annotated with the LFG equation T=J. Linguistic generalisations are provided over the left (the prefix) and the right (suffix) context of the head for each syntactic category occurring as the mother node of such heads. To give a simple example, the rightmost NP to the left of a VP head under an S is likely to be its subject (T SUBJ =J), while the leftmost NP to the right of the V head of a VP is most probably its object (T OBJ =J).

The scale of our evaluation is comparable to hers. This allows us to make tentative comparisons between our respective results. The figures shown in Table 5 are the results of three different kinds of evaluation with the threshold set to 1% and 5%. The effect of the threshold increase is obvious in that Precision goes up for each of the experiments while Recall goes down. For Exp 1, we excluded prepositional phrases entirely from the comparison, i.e. assumed that PPs were adjunct material (e.g. [subj,obl:for] becomes [subj]). Our results are better for Precision than for Recall compared to S</context>

Exp 2 includes prepositional phrases but not parameterised for particular prepositions (e.g. [subj,obl:for] becomes [subj,obl]). While our figures for Recall are again lower, our results for Precision are considerably higher than those of Schulte im Walde (op cit.) who recorded Precision of 60.76%, Recall of 63.91% and an F-score of 62.30%. For Exp. 3, we used semantic forms which contained details of specific prepositions for any subcategorised prepositional phrase. Our Precision figures are again high (in comparison to 65.52% as recorded by (Schulte im Walde, 2002)).

Unlike many other approaches to subcategorisation frame extraction, our system properly reflects the effects of long distance dependencies and distinguishes between active and passive frames. Finally our system associates conditional probabilities with the frames we extract. We carried out an extensive evaluation of the complete induced lexicon (not just a sample) against the full COMLEX resource. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive qualitative evaluation of subcategorisation extraction in English. The only evaluation of a similar scale is that carried out by (Schulte im Walde, 2002) for German. Our results compare well with hers. We believe our semantic forms are fine-grained and by choosing to evaluate against COMLEX we set our sights high: COMLEX is considerably more detailed than the OALD or LDOCE used for other evaluations. Currently work is under way to extend the coverage of our acquired lexicons by applying our methodology to the Penn-III treebank, a more balanced corpus resource with a number of text genres (in addition to the WSJ sections). It is important to realise that the induction of lexical resources is part of a larger project on the acquisition of wide-c</context>

(Manning, 1993) observes that Brent’s recognition technique is a “rather simplistic and inadequate approach to verb detection, with a very high error rate”. Manning feeds the output from a stochastic tagger into a finite state parser, and applies statistical filtering to the parsing results. He predefines 19 different subcategorisation frames, including details of prepositions. Applying this technique to approx. 4 million words of New York Times newswire, Manning acquires 4900 subcategorisation frames for 3104 verbs, an average of 1.6 per verb. (Ushioda et al., 1993) run a finite state NP parser on a POS-tagged corpus to calculate the relative frequency of just six subcategorisation verb classes. In addition, all prepositional phrases are treated as adjuncts. For 1565 tokens of 33 selected verbs, they report an accuracy rate of 83%. (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) observe that in the work of (Brent, 1993), (Manning, 1993) and (Ushioda et al., 1993), “the maximum number of distinct subcategorization classes recognized is sixteen, and only Ushioda et al. attempt to derive relative subcategorization frequency for individual predicates”.

(Kinyon and Prolo, 2002) introduce a tool which uses fine-grained rules to identify the arguments, including optional arguments, of each verb occurrence in the Penn Treebank, along with their syntactic functions. They manually examined the 150+ possible sequences of tags, both functional and categorial, in Penn-II and determined whether the sequence in question denoted a modifier, argument or optional argument. Arguments were then mapped to traditional syntactic functions. As they do not include an evaluation, currently it is impossible to say how effective this technique is. (Xia et al., 2000) and (Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000) extract lexicalised TAGs from the Penn Treebank. Both techniques implement variations on the approaches of (Magerman, 1994) and (Collins, 1997) for the purpose of differentiating between complement and adjunct. In the case of (Xia et al., 2000), invalid elementary trees produced as a result of annotation errors in the treebank are filtered out using linguistic heuristics. (Hockenmaier et al., 2002) outline a method for the automatic extraction of a large syntactic CCG lexicon from Penn-II. For each tree, the algorithm annotates the nodes with CCG categories </context>
