We train and evaluate two models for Ro-
manian stress prediction: a baseline model
which employs the consonant-vowel struc-
ture of the words and a cascaded model
with averaged perceptron training con-
sisting of two sequential models – one for
predicting syllable boundaries and another
one for predicting stress placement. We
show in this paper that Romanian stress is
predictable, though not deterministic, by
using data-driven machine learning tech-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823343283582">
Romanian is a highly inflected language with a
rich morphology. As dictionaries usually fail to
cover the pronunciation aspects for all word forms
in languages with such a rich and irregular mor-
phology (Sef et al., 2002), we believe that a
data-driven approach is very suitable for syllabi-
cation and stress prediction for Romanian words.
Moreover, such a system proves extremely useful
for inferring syllabication and stress placement for
out-of-vocabulary words, for instance neologisms
or words which recently entered the language.
Even if they are closely related, Romanian
stress and syllabication were unevenly studied in
the computational linguistic literature, i.e., the
Romanian syllable received much more attention
than the Romanian stress (Dinu and Dinu, 2005;
Dinu, 2003; Dinu et al., 2013; Toma et al., 2009).
One possible explanation for the fact that Roma-
nian syllabication was more intensively studied
than Romanian stress is the immediate application
of syllabication to text editors which need reliable
hyphenation. Another explanation could be that
most linguists (most recently Dindelegan (2013))
insisted that Romanian stress is not predictable,
thus discouraging attempts to investigate any sys-
tematic patterns.
Romanian is indeed a challenging case study,
because of the obvious complexities of the data
with respect to stress assignment. At first sight, no
obvious patterns emerge for learning stress place-
ment (Dindelegan, 2013), other than as part of in-
dividual lexical items. The first author who chal-
lenges this view is Chitoran (2002), who argues in
favor of the predictability of the Romanian stress
system. She states that stress placement strongly
depends on the morphology of the language, more
precisely on the distribution of the lexical items
based on their part of speech (Chitoran, 1996).
Thus, considering this type of information, lexical
items can be clustered in a limited number of re-
gular subpatterns and the unpredictability of stress
placement is significantly reduced. A rule-based
method for lexical stress prediction on Romanian
was introduced by Oancea and Badulescu (2002).
Dou et al. (2009) address lexical stress predic-
tion as a sequence tagging problem, which proves
to be an accurate approach for this task. The
effectiveness of using conditional random fields
for orthographic syllabication is investigated by
Trogkanis and Elkan (2010), who employ them
for determining syllable boundaries and show that
they outperform previous methods. Bartlett et
al. (2008) use a discriminative tagger for auto-
matic orthographic syllabication and present seve-
ral approaches for assigning labels, including the
language-independent Numbered NB tag scheme,
which labels each letter with a value equal to the
distance between the letter and the last syllable
boundary. According to Damper et al. (1999), syl-
lable structure and stress pattern are very useful in
text-to-speech synthesis, as they provide valuable
knowledge regarding the pronunciation modeling.
Besides converting the letters to the corresponding
phonemes, information about syllable boundaries
and stress placement is also needed for the correct
synthesizing of a word in grapheme-to-phoneme
conversion (Demberg et al., 2007).

In this paper, we rely on the assumption that the
stress system of Romanian is predictable. We pro-
pose a system for automatic prediction of stress
placement and we investigate its performance by
accounting for several fine-grained characteristics
of Romanian words: part of speech, number of
syllables and consecutive vowels. We investigate
the consonant-vowel structure of the words (C/V
structure) and we detect a high number of stress
patterns. This calls for the need of machine learn-
ing techniques, in order to automatically learn
such a wide range of variational patterns.

2 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98481258974359">
We address the task of stress prediction for Roma-
nian words (out-of-context) as a sequence tagging
problem. In this paper, we account only for the pri-
mary stress, but this approach allows further deve-
lopment in order to account for secondary stress
as well. We propose a cascaded model consist-
ing of two sequential models trained separately,
the output of the first being used as input for the
second. We use averaged perceptron for parame-
ter estimation and three types of features which are
described in detail further in this section: n-grams
of characters, n-grams marking the C/V structure
of the word and binary positional indicators of the
current character with respect to the syllable struc-
ture of the word. We use one sequential model
to predict syllable boundaries and another one to
predict stress placement. Previous work on or-
thographic syllabication for Romanian (Dinu et
al., 2013) shows that, although a rule-based algo-
rithm models complex interactions between fea-
tures, its practicality is limited. The authors re-
port experiments on a Romanian dataset, where
the rule-based algorithm is outperformed by an
SVM classifier and a CRF system with character
n-gram features.
We use a simple tagging structure for mar-
king primary stress. The stressed vowel re-
ceives the positive tag 1, while all previous cha-
racters are tagged 0 and all subsequent ones
2. This structure helps enforce the uniqueness
of the positive tag. The main features used
are character n-grams up to n = W in a win-
dow of radius W around the current position.
For example, if W = 2, the feature template
consists of c[-2], c[-1], c[0], c[1], c[2],
c[-2:-1], c[-1:0], c[0:1], c[1:2]. If the
current letter is the fourth of the word dinosaur,
o, the feature values would be i, n, o, s, a, in, no,
os, sa. We use two additional types of features:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.953487571428571">
• features regarding the C/V structure of the
word: n-grams using, instead of characters,
markers for consonants (C) and vowels (V);
• binary indicators of the following positional
statements about the current character, re-
lated to the statistics reported in Table 1:
– exactly before/after a split;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981372571428571">
– in the first/second/third/fourth syllable
of the word, counting from left to right;
– in the first/second/third/fourth syllable
of the word, counting from right to left
The syllabication prediction is performed with
another sequential model of length n − 1, where
each node corresponds to a position between two
characters. Based on experimenting and previ-
ous work, we adopted the Numbered NB labeling.
Each position is labeled with an integer denoting
the distance from the previous boundary. For ex-
ample, for the word diamond, the syllable (above)
and stress annotations (below) are as follows:
d i a m o n d
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.953314">
1 0 0 1 2 3
0 1 2 2 2 2 2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998698">
The features used for syllabication are based on
the same principle, but because the positions are
in-between characters, the window of radius W
has length 2W instead of 2W + 1. For this model
we used only character n-grams as features.

3 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997371157894737">
We run our experiments for Romanian using the
RoSyllabiDict (Barbu, 2008) dictionary, which is
a dataset of annotated words comprising 525,528
inflected forms for approximately 65,000 lemmas.
This is, to our best knowledge, the largest experi-
ment conducted and reported for Romanian so far.
For each entry, the syllabication and the stressed
vowel (and, in case of ambiguities, also grammat-
ical information or type of syllabication) are pro-
vided. For example, the word copii (children) has
the following representation:
&lt;form w=&amp;quot;copii&amp;quot; obs=&amp;quot;s.&amp;quot;&gt; co-píi&lt;/form&gt;
We investigate stress placement with regard to
the syllable structure and we provide in Table 1
the percentages of words having the stress placed
on different positions, counting syllables from the
beginning and from the end of the words as well.
For our experiments, we discard words which
do not have the stressed vowel marked, compound

of C/V structures, most of which are not determin-

We train and evaluate a cascaded model consist-

set (on which we perform cross-validation to se-

set (with unseen words, on which we evaluate the
performance of our system). We use the same
train/test sets for the two sequential models, but
they are trained independently. The output of the
first model (used for predicting syllabication) is
used for determining feature values for the second
one (used for predicting stress placement) for the

and using predicted syllabication to determine fea-
ture values. The results with gold syllabication
are reported only for providing an upper bound for
learning and for comparison.
We use averaged perceptron training (Collins,
2002) from CRFsuite (Okazaki, 2007). For the
stress prediction model we optimize hyperparam-
eters using grid search to maximize the 3-fold
cross-validation F1 score of class 1, which marks
the stressed vowels. We searched over {2,3,4}
for W and over {1,5,10,25,50} for the maximum
number of iterations. The values which optimize
the system are 4 for W and 50 for the maximum
number of iterations. We investigate, during grid
search, whether employing C/V markers and bi-
nary positional indicators improve our system’s
performance. It turns out that in most cases they
do. For the syllabication model, the optimal hy-
perparameters are 4 for the window radius and 50
for the maximum number of iterations. We evalu-
ate the cross-validation F1 score of class 0, which
marks the position of a hyphen. The system ob-
tains 0.995 instance accuracy for predicting sylla-
ble boundaries.
We use a &amp;quot;majority class&amp;quot; type of baseline
which employs the C/V structures described in
Section 3 and assigns, for a word in the test set,
the stress pattern which is most common in the
training set for the C/V structure of the word, or
places the stress randomly on a vowel if the C/V
structure is not found in the training set2. The per-
formance of both models on RoSyllabiDict dataset
is reported in Table 2. We report word-level ac-
curacy, that is, we account for words for which
the stress pattern was correctly assigned. As ex-
pected, the cascaded model performs significantly
better than the baseline.

The overall accuracy is 0.975 for the cascaded
model with gold syllabication and 0.973 for the
cascaded model with predicted syllabication. The
former system outperforms the latter by only very
little. With regard to the part of speech, the high-
est accuracy when gold syllabication is used was
obtained for verbs (0.995), followed by adjectives
(0.992) and by nouns (0.979). When dividing the
dataset with respect to the words’ part of speech,
the cascaded model with predicted syllabication
is outperformed only for verbs. With only a few
exceptions, the accuracy steadily increases with
the number of syllables. The peak is reached for
words with 6 syllables when using the gold syllab-
ication and for words with 7 syllables when using
the predicted syllabication. Although, intuitively,
the accuracy should be inversely proportional to
the number of syllables, because the number of
potential positions for stress placement increases,
there are numerous stress patterns for words with
6, 7 or more syllables, which never occur in the
dataset3. It is interesting to notice that stress pre-
diction accuracy is almost equal for words con-
taining two or more consecutive vowels and for
words without consecutive vowels. As expected,
when words are divided in categories based on
their characteristics the system is able to predict
stress placement with higher accuracy.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999360190476191">
In this paper we showed that Romanian stress
is predictable, though not deterministic, by using
data-driven machine learning techniques. Syllable
structure is important and helps the task of stress
prediction. The cascaded sequential model using
gold syllabication outperforms systems with pre-
dicted syllabication by only very little.
In our future work we intend to experiment with
other features as well, such as syllable n-grams
instead of character n-grams, for the sequential
model. We plan to conduct a thorough error analy-
sis and to investigate the words for which the sys-
tems did not correctly predict the position of the
stressed vowels. We intend to further investigate
the C/V structures identified in this paper and to
analyze the possibility to reduce the number of
patterns by considering details of word structure
(for example, instead of using raw data, to aug-
ment the model with annotations about which let-
ters are actually vowels) and to adapt the learning
model to finer-grained linguistic analysis.

This is, to our best knowledge, the largest experiment conducted and reported for Romanian so far. For each entry, the syllabication and the stressed vowel (and, in case of ambiguities, also grammatical information or type of syllabication) are provided.

We use a simple tagging structure for marking primary stress. The stressed vowel receives the positive tag 1, while all previous characters are tagged 0 and all subsequent ones 2.

We show in this paper that Romanian stress is predictable, though not deterministic, by using data-driven machine learning techniques. 1 Introduction Romanian is a highly inflected language with a rich morphology. As dictionaries usually fail to cover the pronunciation aspects for all word forms in languages with such a rich and irregular morphology (Sef et al., 2002), we believe that a data-driven approach is very suitable for syllabication and stress prediction for Romanian words. Moreover, such a system proves extremely useful for inferring syllabication and stress placement for out-of-vocabulary words, for instance neologisms or words which recently entered the language.

Moreover, such a system proves extremely useful for inferring syllabication and stress placement for out-of-vocabulary words, for instance neologisms or words which recently entered the language. Even if they are closely related, Romanian stress and syllabication were unevenly studied in the computational linguistic literature, i.e., the Romanian syllable received much more attention than the Romanian stress (Dinu and Dinu, 2005; Dinu, 2003; Dinu et al., 2013; Toma et al., 2009). One possible explanation for the fact that Romanian syllabication was more intensively studied than Romanian stress is the immediate application of syllabication to text editors which need reliable hyphenation. Another explanation could be that most linguists (most recently Dindelegan (2013)) insisted that Romanian stress is not predictable, thus discouraging attempts to investigate any systematic patterns. Romanian is indeed a challenging case study, because of the obvious complexities of the data with respect to stress assignment. At first sight, no obvious patterns emerge for learning str</context>

Thus, considering this type of information, lexical items can be clustered in a limited number of regular subpatterns and the unpredictability of stress placement is significantly reduced. A rule-based method for lexical stress prediction on Romanian was introduced by Oancea and Badulescu (2002). Dou et al. (2009) address lexical stress prediction as a sequence tagging problem, which proves to be an accurate approach for this task. The effectiveness of using conditional random fields for orthographic syllabication is investigated by Trogkanis and Elkan (2010), who employ them for determining syllable boundaries and show that they outperform previous methods. Bartlett et al. (2008) use a discriminative tagger for automatic orthographic syllabication and present several approaches for assigning labels, including the language-independent Numbered NB tag scheme, which labels each letter with a value equal to the distance between the letter and the last syllable boundary. According to Damper et al. (1999), syllable structure and stress pattern are very useful in text-to-speech synthesis, as they provide valuable knowledge regarding the pronunciation mo</context>
