Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.989869083333333">
In this paper, we propose an
implementable characterization of genre
suitable for automatic genre
identification of web pages. This
characterization is implemented as an
inferential model based on a modified
version of Bayes&apos; theorem. Such a model
can deal with genre hybridism and
individualization, two important forces
behind genre evolution. Results show
that this approach is effective and is
worth further research.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997904477612">
The term `genre&apos; is employed in virtually all
cultural fields: literature, music, art, architecture,
dance, pedagogy, hypermedia studies, computer-
mediated communication, and so forth. As has
often been pointed out, it is hard to pin down the
concept of genre from a unified perspective (cf.
Kwasnik and Crowston, 2004). This lack is also
experienced in the more restricted world of non-
literary or non-fictional document genres, such
as professional or instrumental genres, where
variation due to personal style is less pronounced
than in literary genres. In particular, scholars
working with practical genres focus upon a
specific environment. For instance Swales (1990)
develops his notion of genre in academic and
research settings, Bathia (1993) in professional
settings, and so on. In automatic genre
classification studies, genres have often been
seen as non-topical categories that could help
reduce information overload (e.g. Mayer zu
Eissen and Stein, 2004; Lim et al., 2005).
Despite the lack of an agreed theoretical
notion, genre is a well-established term,
intuitively understood in its vagueness. What
humans intuitively perceive is that there are
categories created within a culture, a society or a
community which are used to group documents
that share some conventions. Each of these
groups is a genre, i.e. a cultural object or artefact,
purposely made to meet and streamline
communicative needs. Genres show sets of
standardized or conventional characteristics that
make them recognizable, and this identity raises
specific expectations.
Together with conventions and expectations,
genres have many other traits. We would like to
focus on three traits, namely hybridism,
individualization and evolution. Genres are not
mutually exclusive and different genres can be
merged into a single document, generating
hybrid forms. Also, genres allow a certain
freedom of variation and consequently can be
individualized. Finally, genre repertoires are
dynamic, i.e. they change over time, thus
triggering genre change and evolution. It is also
important to notice that before genre conventions
become fully standardized, a genre does not have
an official name. A genre name becomes
acknowledged when the genre itself has an active
role and a communicative function in a
community or society (Swales, 1990). Before
this acknowledgement, a genre shows hybrid or
individualized forms, and indistinct functions.
Putting all these traits together, we suggest the
following broad theoretical characterization of
genre of written texts: genres are named
communication artefacts characterized by
conventions, raising expectations, showing
hybridism and individualization, and undergoing
evolution.
This characterization is flexible enough to
encompass not only paper genres (both literary
and practical genres), but also digital genres, and
more specifically web genres. Web genres or
cybergenres (Shepherd and Watters 1998) are
those genres created by the combination of the
use of the computer and the Internet.

Genre hybridism and individualization are very
evident on the web. In fact, web pages are often
very hybrid because of the wider intra-genre
variation and the smaller inter-genre
differentiation. They can also be highly
individualized because of the creative freedom
provided by HTML tags (the building blocks of
web pages) or programming languages such as
Javascript. We suggest that genre hybridism and
individualization can be seen as forces acting
behind genre evolution. They allow the upgrade
of existing genres and the creation of novel
genres.
The change of genre repertoire and the
creation of new genres were well illustrated by
Crowston and Williams (2000) and Shepherd and
Watters (1998). Both these studies describe a
similar process. Web genres can start either as
reproductions or as unprecedented types of
documents. In the first case, existing genres are
gradually upgraded and modified to adapt to
potentials offered by the web. These variants
might become very different from the original
genres with time passing by. In the second case,
novel genres can be generated from specific
needs and requirements of the web. Crowston
and Williams (2000) have traced this evolution
through a manual qualitative survey of 1000 web
pages. Shepherd and Watters (1998) have
proposed a fuzzy taxonomy for web genres.
We would like to add a new force in this
scenario, namely emerging genres. Emerging
genre are those genres still in formation, not fully
standardized and without any name or fixed
function. For example, before 1998 web logs (or
blogs) were already present on the web, but they
were not yet identified as a genre. They were just
&amp;quot;web pages&amp;quot;, with similar characteristics and
functions. In 1999, suddenly a community sprang
up using this new genre (Blood, 2000). Only at
this point, the genre &amp;quot;web log&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; started
being spread and being recognized.
Emerging genres may account for all those
web pages, which remain unclassified or
unclassifiable (cf. Crowston and Williams, 2000)
because they show genre mixture or no genre at
all. Authors often point out that assigning a genre
to a web page might be difficult and
controversial (e.g. Roussinov et al., 2001; Meyer
zu Eissen and Stein, 2004; Shepherd et al., 2004)
because web pages can appear hybrid or peculiar.
Genre-mixed web pages or web pages without
any evident genre can represent the antecedent of
a future genre, but currently they might be
considered as belonging to a genre still in
formation. It is also important to highlight,
however, that since the acknowledgement of
genre relies on social acceptance, it is impossible
to define the exact point at which a new genre
emerges (Crowston and Williams 2000). The
multi-facetted model capable of hosting new
genres wished for by Kwasnik and Crowston
(2004), and the adaptive learning system that can
identify genre as they emerge announced by
Shepherd et al. (2004) are hard to implement.
For this reason, the focus of the method proposed
below is not to detect emerging genres, but to
show a flexible approach capable of giving
account of genre hybridism and
individualization.
Flexible genre classification systems are
uncommon in automatic genre classification
studies. Apart from two notable exceptions,
namely Kessler et al. (1997) and Rehm (2006)
whose implementations require extensive manual
annotation (Kessler et al., 1997) or analysis
(Rehm, 2006), genres are usually classified as
single-label discrete entities, relying on the
simplified assumption that a document can be
assigned to only one genre.
In this paper, we propose a tuple
representation that maps onto the theoretical
characterization of genre suggested above and
that can be implemented without much overhead.
The implementable tuple includes the following
attributes:
(genre(s)) of web pages=&lt;linguisti� features, HTML, text types, (...p
This tuple means that web pages can have zero,
one or more genres ((genre(s)) of web pages)
and that this situation can be captured by a
number of attributes. For the time being these
attributes are limited to linguistic features,
HTML tags, text types, but in future other
attributes can be added ([...j). The attributes of
the tuple can capture the presence of textual
conventions or their absence. The presence of
conventions brings about expectations, and can
be used to identify acknowledged genres. The
absence of conventions brings about hybridism
and individualisation and can be interpreted in
terms of emerging genres and genre evolution.
In this paper we present a simple model that
implement the tuple and can deal with this
complex situation. This model is based on
statistical inference, performs automatic text
analysis and has a classification scheme that
includes zero labels, one label or multiple labels.
More specifically, in addition to the traditional
single-label classification, a zero-label
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.964672">
700
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977814285714">
classification is useful when, for example, a web
page is so peculiar from a textual point of view
that it does not show any similarity with the
genres included in the model. Conversely, a
multi-label classification is useful when web
pages show several genres at the same time. As
there is no standard evaluation metrics for a
comprehensive evaluation of such a model, we
defer to further research the assessment of the
model as a whole. In this paper, we report a
partial evaluation based on single-label
classification accuracy and predictions.
From a theoretical point of view, the
inferential model makes a clear-cut separation
between the concepts of `text types&apos; and
`genres&apos;. Text types are rhetorical/discourse
patterns dictated by the purposes of a text. For
example, when the purpose of a text producer is
to narrate, the narration text type is used. On the
contrary, genres are cultural objects created by a
society or a community, characterized by a set of
linguistic and non-linguistic conventions, which
can be fulfilled, personalized, transgressed,
colonized, etc., but that are nonetheless
recognized by the members of the society and
community that have created them, raising
predictable expectations. For example, what we
expect from a personal blog is diary-form
narration of the self, where opinions and
comments are freely expressed.
The model presented here is capable of
inferring text types from web pages using a
modified form of Bayes&apos; theorem, and derive
genres through if-then rules.
With this model, emerging genres can be
hypothesized through the analysis of unexpected
combinations of text types and/or other traits in a
large number of web pages. However, this
potential will be investigated in future work. The
results presented here are just a first step towards
a more dynamic view of a genre classification
system.
Automatic identification of text types and
genres represents a great advantage in many
fields because manual annotation is expensive
and time-consuming. Apart from the benefits that
it could bring to information retrieval,
information extraction, digital libraries and so
forth, automatic identification of text types and
genres could be particularly useful for problems
that natural language processing (NLP) is
concerned with. For example, parsing accuracy
could be increased if parsers were tested on
different text types or genres, as certain
constructions may occur only in certain types of
texts. The same is true for Part-of-Speech (POS)
tagging and word sense disambiguation. More
accurate NLP tools could in turn be beneficial for
automatic genre identification, because many
features used for this task are extracted from the
output of taggers and parsers, such as POS
frequencies and syntactic constructions.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2
reports previous characterization that have been
implemented as statistical or computational
models; Section 3 illustrates the attributes of the
tuple; Section 4 describes the inferential model
and reports evaluation; finally in Section 5 we
draw some conclusions and outline points for
future work.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768243243243">
Although both Crowston and Williams (2000)
and Shepherd and Watters (1998) have well
described the evolution of genres on the web,
when it comes to the actual genre identification
of web pages (Roussinov et al., 2001; and
Shepherd et al., 2004, respectively), they set
aside the evolutionary aspect and consider genre
from a static point of view. For Crowston and
Williams (2000) and the follow-up Roussinov et
al. (2001) most genres imply a combination of
&lt;purpose/function, form, content&gt;, and, as they
are complex entities, a multi-facetted
classification seems appropriate (Kwasnik and
Crowston, 2004). For Shepherd and Watters
(1998) and the practical implementation
Shepherd et al. (2004), cybergenres or web
genres are characterized by the triple &lt;content,
form, functionality&gt;, where functionality is a key
evolutionary aspect afforded by the web.
Crowston and co-workers have not yet
implemented the combination of
&lt;purpose/function, form, content&gt; together with
the facetted classification in any automatic
classification model, but the tuple &lt;content,
form, function&gt; has been employed by Rehm
(2006) for an original approach to single-web
genre analysis, the personal home pages in the
domain of academia. Rehm (2006) describes the
relationship between HTML and web genres and
depicts the evolutionary processes that shape and
form web genres. In the practical
implementation, however, he focuses only on a
single web genre, the academic&apos;s personal home
page, that is seen from a static point of view. As
far as we know, Boese and Howe (2005) is the
only study that tries to implement a diachronic
view on genre of web pages using the triple
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989617">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999053125">
&lt;style, form, content&gt;. This study has the
practical aim of finding out whether feature sets
for genre identification need to be changed or
updated because of genre evolution. They tried to
detect the change through the use of a classifier
on two parallel corpora separated by a six-year
gap. Although this study does not focus on how
to detect newly created web genres or how to
deal with difficult web pages, it is an interesting
starting point for traditional diachronic analysis
applied to automatic genre classification.
In contrast, the model described in this paper
aims at pointing out genre hybridism and
individualisation in web pages. These two
phenomena can be interpreted in terms of genre
evolution in future investigations.

3 Attributes of the Tuple
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999240060606061">
The attributes &lt;linguistic features, HTML tags,
text types&gt; of the tuple represent the
computationally tractable version of the
combination &lt;purpose, form&gt; often used to
define the concept of genre (e.g. cf. Roussinov et
al. 2001).
In our view, the purpose corresponds to text
types, i.e. the rhetorical patterns that indicate
what a text has been written for. For example, a
text can be produced to narrate, instruct, argue,
etc. Narration, instruction, and argumentation are
examples of text types. As stressed earlier, text
types are usually considered separate entities
from genres (cf. Biber, 1988; Lee, 2001).
Form is a more heterogeneous attribute. Form
can refer to linguistic form and to the shape
(layout etc.). From an automatic point of view,
linguistic form is represented by linguistic
features, while shape is represented by HTML
tags. Also the functionality attribute introduced
by Shepherd and Watters (1998) can be seen in
terms of HTML tags (e.g. tags for links and
scripts). While content words or terms show
some drawbacks for automatic genre
identification (cf. Boese and Howe, 2005), there
are several types of linguistic features that return
good results, for instance, Biberian features
(Biber, 1988). In the model presented here we
use a mixture of Biberian features and additional
syntactic traits. The total number of features used
in this implementation of the model is 100.
These features are available online at:

4 Inferential Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995541509434">
The inferential model presented here (partially
discussed in Santini (2006a) combines the
advantages of deductive and inductive
approaches. It is deductive because the co-
occurrence and the combination of features in
text types is decided a priori by the linguist on
the basis on previous studies, and not derived by
a statistical procedure, which is too biased
towards high frequencies (some linguistic
phenomena can be rare, but they are nonetheless
discriminating). It is also inductive because the
inference process is corpus-based, which means
that it is based on a pool of data used to predict
some text types. A few handcrafted if-then rules
combine the inferred text types with other traits
(mainly layout and functionality tags) in order to
suggest genres. These rules are worked out either
on the basis of previous genre studies or of a
cursory qualitative analysis. For example, rules
for personal home pages are based on the
observations by Roberts (1998), Dillon and
Gushrowski (2000). When previous studies were
not available, as in the cases of eshops or search
pages, the author of this paper has briefly
analysed these genres to extract generalizations
useful to write few rules.
It is important to stress that there is no hand-
coding in the model. Web pages were randomly
downloaded from genre-specific portals or
archives without any further annotation. Web
pages were parsed, linguistic features were
automatically extracted and counted from the
parsed outputs, while frequencies of HTML tags
were automatically counted from the raw web
pages. All feature frequencies were normalized
by the length of web pages (in tokens) and then
submitted to the model.
As stated earlier, the inferential model makes
a clear-cut separation between text types and
genres. The four text types included in this
implementation are: descriptive_narrative,
expository_informational, argumentative_persuasive,
and instructional. The linguistic features for these
text types come from previous (corpus-)linguistic
studies (Werlich 1976; Biber, 1988; etc.), and are
not extracted from the corpus using statistical
methods. For each web page the model returns
the probability of belonging to the four text
types. For example, a web page can have 0.9
probabilities of being argumentative�persuasive,
0.7 of being instructional and so on. Probabilities
are interpreted in terms of degree or gradation.
For example, a web page with 0.9 probabilities
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994829">
702
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982076923077">
of being argumentative�persuasive shows a high
gradation of argumentation. Gradations/
probabilities are ranked for each web page.
The computation of text types as intermediate
step between linguistic and non-linguistic
features and genres is useful if we see genres as
conventionalised and standardized cultural
objects raising expectations. For example, what
we expect from an editorial is an `opinion&apos; or a
`comment&apos; by the editor, which represents,
broadly speaking, the view of the newspaper or
magazine. Opinions are a form of
`argumentation&apos;. Argumentation is a rhetorical
pattern, or text type, expressed by a combination
of linguistic features. If a document shows a high
probability of being argumentative, i.e. it has a
high gradation of argumentation, this document
has a good chance of belonging to argumentative
genres, such as editorials, sermons, pleadings,
academic papers, etc. It has less chances of being
a story, a biography, etc. We suggest that the
exploitation of this knowledge about the
textuality of a web page can add flexibility to the
model and this flexibility can capture hybridism
and individualization, the key forces behind
genre evolution.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994742">
4.1 The Web Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998496892857143">
The inferential model is based on a corpus
representative of the web. In this implementation
of the model we approximated one of the
possible compositions of a random slice of the
web, statistically supported by reliable standard
error measures. We built a web corpus with four
BBC web genres (editorial, Do-It-Yourself
(DIY) mini-guide, short biography, and feature),
seven novel web genres (blog, eshop, FAQs,
front page, listing, personal home page, search
page), and 1,000 unclassified web pages from
SPIRIT collection (Joho and Sanderson, 2004).
The total number of web pages is 2,480. The four
BBC genres represent traditional genres adapted
to the functionalities of the web, while the seven
genres are novel web genres, either
unprecedented or showing a loose kinship with
paper genres. Proportions are purely arbitrary
and based on the assumption that at least half of
web users tend to use recognized genre patterns
in order to achieve felicitous communication. We
consider the sampling distribution of the sample
mean as approximately normal, following the
Central Limit Theorem. This allows us to make
inferences even if the population distribution is
irregular or if variables are very skewed or
highly discrete. The web corpus is available at:

4.2 Bayesian Inference: Inferring with
Odds-Likelihood
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999868066666666">
The inferential model is based on a modified
version of Bayes&apos; theorem. This modified
version uses a form of Bayes&apos; theorem called
odds-likelihood or subjective Bayesian method
(Duda and Reboh, 1984) and is capable of
solving more complex reasoning problems than
the basic version. Odds is a number that tells us
how much more likely one hypothesis is than the
other. Odds and probabilities contain exactly the
same information and are interconvertible. The
main difference with original Bayes&apos; theorem is
that in the modified version much of the effort is
devoted to weighing the contributions of
different pieces of evidence in establishing the
match with a hypothesis. These weights are
confidence measures: Logical Sufficiency (LS)
and Logical Necessity (LN). LS is used when the
evidence is known to exist (larger value means
greater sufficiency), while LN is used when
evidence is known NOT to exist (a smaller value
means greater necessity). LS is typically a
number &gt; 1, and LN is typically a number &lt; 1.
Usually LS*LN=1. In this implementation of the
model, LS and LN were set to 1.25 and 0.8
respectively, on the basis of previous studies and
empirical adjustments. Future work will include
more investigation on the tuning of these two
parameters.
The steps included in the model are the
following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.69540955">
1) Representation of the web in a corpus that is
approximately normal.
2) Extraction, count and normalization of genre-
revealing features.
3) Conversion of normalized counts into z-scores,
which represent the deviation from the `norm&apos;
coming out from the web corpus. The concept of
&amp;quot;gradation&amp;quot; is based on these deviations from the
norm.
4) Conversion of z-scores into probabilities, which
means that feature frequencies are seen in terms
of probabilities distribution.
5) Calculation of prior odds from prior probabilities
of a text type. The prior probability for each of
the four text types was set to 0.25 (all text types
were given an equal chance to appear in a web
page). Prior odds are calculated with the formula:
pr0dds(H)=prProb(H)/1-prProb(H)
6) Calculation of weighted features, or multipliers
(Mn). If a feature or piece of evidence (E) has a
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.998301">
703
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.785977888888889">
probability &gt;=0.5, LS is applied, otherwise LN is
applied. Multipliers are calculated with the
following formulae:
if Prob (E)&gt;=0.5 then
M(E)=1+(LS-1)(Prob(E)-0.5)/0.25
if Prob (E)&lt;0.5 then
M(E)=1-(1-LN)(0.5-Prob(E))/0.25
7) Multiplication of weighted probabilities together,
according to the co-occurrence decided by the
analyst on the basis of previous studies in order to
infer text types. In this implementation the
feature co-occurrence was decided following
Werlich (1976) and Biber (1988).
8) Posterior odds for the text type is then calculated
by multiplying prior odds (step 5) with co-
occurrence of weighted features (step 7).
9) Finally, posterior odds is re-converted into a
probability value with the following formula:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.957432">
Prob(H)=Odds(H) /1+Odds(H)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968909090909">
Although odds contains exactly the same
information as probability values, they are not
constrained in 0-1 range, like probabilities.
Once text types have been inferred, if-then
rules are applied for determining genres. In
particular, for each of the seven web genre
included in this implementation, few hand-
crafted rules combine the two predominant text
types per web genre with additional traits. For
example, the actual rules for deriving a blog are
as simple as the following ones:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.8939158">
if (text_type_1=descr_narrat_1Jargum_pers_1)
if (text_type_2=descr_narrat_21argum_pers_2)
if (page_length=LONG)
if (blog_words &gt;= 0.5 probabilities)
then good blog candidate.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830565217391">
That is, if a web page has description—narration
and argumentation�persuasion as the two
predominant text types, and the page length is &gt;
500 words (LONG), and the probability value for
blog words is &gt;=0.5 (blog words are terms such
as web log, weblog, blog, journal, diary, posted
by, comments, archive plus names of the days
and months), then this web page is a good blog
candidate.
For other web genres, the number of rules is
higher, but it is worth saying that in the current
implementation, rules are useful to understand
how features interact and correlate.
One important thing to highlight is that each
genre is computed independently for each web
page. Therefore a web page can be assigned to
different genres (Table 1) or to none (Table 2).
Multi-label and no-label classification cannot be
evaluated with standard metrics and their
evaluation requires further research. In the next
subsection we present the evaluation of the
single label classification returned by the
inferential model.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998064">
4.3 Evaluation of the Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99951196">
Single-label classification. For the seven web
genres we compared the classification accuracy
of the inferential model with the accuracy of
classifiers. Two standard classifiers — SVM and
Naive Bayes from Weka Machine Learning
Workbench (Witten, Frank, 2005) — were run on
the seven web genres. The stratified cross-
validated accuracy returned by these classifiers
for one seed is ca. 89% for SVM and ca. 67% for
Naive Bayes. The accuracy achieved by the
inferential model is ca. 86%.
An accuracy of 86% is a good achievement for
a first implementation, especially if we consider
that the standard Naive Bayes classifier returns
an accuracy of about 67%. Although slightly
lower than SVM, an accuracy of 86% looks
promising because this evaluation is only on a
single label. Ideally the inferential model could
be more accurate than SVM if more labels could
be taken into account. For example, the actual
classification returned by the inferential model is
shown in Table 1. The web pages in Table 1 are
blogs but they also contain either sequences of
questions and answers or are organized like a
how-to document, like in the snippet in Figure 1

The snippet shows an example of genre
colonization, where the vocabulary and text
forms of one genre (FAQs/How to in this case)
are inserted in another (cf. Beghtol, 2001). These
strategies are frequent on the web and might give
rise to new web genres. The model also captures
a situation where the genre labels available in the
system are not suitable for the web page under
analysis, like in the example in Table 2.

This web page (shown in Figure 2) from the
unannotated SPIRIT collection (see Section 4.1)
does not receive any of the genre labels currently
available in the system.
If the pattern shown in Figure 2 keeps on
recurring even when more web genres are added
to the system, a possible interpretation could be
that this pattern might develop into a stable web
genre in future. If this happens, the system will
be ready to host such a novelty. In the current
implementation, only a few rules need to be
added. In future implementations hand-crafted
rules can be replaced by other methods. For
example, an interesting adaptive solution has
been explored by Segal and Kephart (2000).
Predictions. Precision of predictions on one web
genre is used as an additional evaluation metric.
The predictions on the eshop genre issued by the
inferential model are compared with the
predictions returned by two SVM models built
with two different web page collections, Meyer-
zu-Eissen collection and the 7-web-genre
collection (Santini, 2006). Only the predictions
on eshops are evaluated, because eshop is the
only web genre shared by the three models. The
number of predictions is shown in Table 3.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999642941176471">
From a technical point of view, the inferential
model presented in this paper is a simple starting
point for reflection on a number of issues in
automatic identification of genres in web pages.
Although parameters need a better tuning and
text type and genre palettes need to be enlarged,
it seems that the inferential approach is effective,
as shown by the preliminary evaluation reported
in Section 4.3.
More importantly, this model instantiates a
theoretical characterization of genre that includes
hybridism and individualization, and interprets
these two elements as the forces behind genre
evolution. It is also worth noticing that the
inclusion of the attribute `text types&apos; in the tuple
gives flexibility to the model. In fact, the model
can assign not only a single genre label, as in
previous approaches to genre, but also multiple
labels or no label at all. Ideally other
computationally tractable attributes can be added
to the tuple to increase flexibility and provide a
multi-facetted classification, for example register
or layout analysis.
However, other issues remain open. First, the
possibility of a comprehensive evaluation of the
model is to be explored. So far, only tentative
evaluation schemes exist for multi-label
classification (e.g. McCallum, 1999). Further
research is still needed.
Second, in this model the detection of emerging
genres can be done indirectly through the
analysis of an unexpected combination of text
types and/or genres. Other possibilities can be
explored in future. Also the objective evaluation

of emerging genres requires further research and
discussion.
More feasible in the short term is an
investigation of the scalability of the model,
when additional web pages, classified or not
classified by genre, are added to the web corpus.
Also the possibility of replacing hand-crafted
rules with some learning methodology can be
explored in the near future. Apart from the
approach suggested by Segal and Kephart (2000)
mentioned above, many other pieces of
experience are now available on adaptive
learning (for example those reported in the
EACL 2006 on Workshop on Adaptive Text
Extraction and Mining).

As has often been pointed out, it is hard to pin down the concept of genre from a unified perspective (cf. Kwasnik and Crowston, 2004). This lack is also experienced in the more restricted world of nonliterary or non-fictional document genres, such as professional or instrumental genres, where variation due to personal style is less pronounced than in literary genres. In particular, scholars working with practical genres focus upon a specific environment. For instance Swales (1990) develops his notion of genre in academic and research settings, Bathia (1993) in professional settings, and so on. In automatic genre classification studies, genres have often been seen as non-topical categories that could help reduce information overload (e.g. Mayer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004; Lim et al., 2005). Despite the lack of an agreed theoretical notion, genre is a well-established term, intuitively understood in its vagueness. What humans intuitively perceive is that there are categories created within a culture, a society or a community which are used to group documents that share some conventions. Each of these groups is a genre, i.e. a cultural object or art</context>

Roussinov et al. 2001). In our view, the purpose corresponds to text types, i.e. the rhetorical patterns that indicate what a text has been written for. For example, a text can be produced to narrate, instruct, argue, etc. Narration, instruction, and argumentation are examples of text types. As stressed earlier, text types are usually considered separate entities from genres (cf. Biber, 1988; Lee, 2001). Form is a more heterogeneous attribute. Form can refer to linguistic form and to the shape (layout etc.). From an automatic point of view, linguistic form is represented by linguistic features, while shape is represented by HTML tags. Also the functionality attribute introduced by Shepherd and Watters (1998) can be seen in terms of HTML tags (e.g. tags for links and scripts). While content words or terms show some drawbacks for automatic genre identification (cf. Boese and Howe, 2005), there are several types of linguistic features that return good results, for instance, Biberian</context>

All feature frequencies were normalized by the length of web pages (in tokens) and then submitted to the model. As stated earlier, the inferential model makes a clear-cut separation between text types and genres. The four text types included in this implementation are: descriptive_narrative, expository_informational, argumentative_persuasive, and instructional. The linguistic features for these text types come from previous (corpus-)linguistic studies (Werlich 1976; Biber, 1988; etc.), and are not extracted from the corpus using statistical methods. For each web page the model returns the probability of belonging to the four text types. For example, a web page can have 0.9 probabilities of being argumentative�persuasive, 0.7 of being instructional and so on. Probabilities are interpreted in terms of degree or gradation. For example, a web page with 0.9 probabilities 702 of being argumentative�persuasive shows a high gradation of argumentation. Gradations/ probabilities are ranked for each web page.

For example, before 1998 web logs (or blogs) were already present on the web, but they were not yet identified as a genre.

In fact, web pages are often very hybrid because of the wider intra-genre variation and the smaller inter-genre differentiation. They can also be highly individualized because of the creative freedom provided by HTML tags (the building blocks of web pages) or programming languages such as Javascript. We suggest that genre hybridism and individualization can be seen as forces acting behind genre evolution. They allow the upgrade of existing genres and the creation of novel genres. The change of genre repertoire and the creation of new genres were well illustrated by Crowston and Williams (2000) and Shepherd and Watters (1998). Both these studies describe a similar process. Web genres can start either as reproductions or as unprecedented types of documents. In the first case, existing genres are gradually upgraded and modified to adapt to potentials offered by the web. These variants might become very different from the original genres with time passing by. In the second case, novel genres can be generated from specific needs and requirements of the web.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reports previous characterization that have been implemented as statistical or computational models; Section 3 illustrates the attributes of the tuple; Section 4 describes the inferential model and reports evaluation; finally in Section 5 we draw some conclusions and outline points for future work. 2 Background Although both Crowston and Williams (2000) and Shepherd and Watters (1998) have well described the evolution of genres on the web, when it comes to the actual genre identification of web pages (Roussinov et al., 2001; and Shepherd et al., 2004, respectively), they set aside the evolutionary aspect and consider genre from a static point of view. For Crowston and Williams (2000) and the follow-up Roussinov et al. (2001) most genres imply a combination of &lt;purpose/function, form, content&gt;, and, as they are complex entities, a multi-facetted classification seems appropriate (Kwasnik and Crowston, 2004).

In this implementation of the model we approximated one of the possible compositions of a random slice of the web, statistically supported by reliable standard error measures. We built a web corpus with four BBC web genres (editorial, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) mini-guide, short biography, and feature), seven novel web genres (blog, eshop, FAQs, front page, listing, personal home page, search page), and 1,000 unclassified web pages from SPIRIT collection (Joho and Sanderson, 2004). The total number of web pages is 2,480. The four BBC genres represent traditional genres adapted to the functionalities of the web, while the seven genres are novel web genres, either unprecedented or showing a loose kinship with paper genres. Proportions are purely arbitrary and based on the assumption that at least half of web users tend to use recognized genre patterns in order to achieve felicitous communication.

Such a model can deal with genre hybridism and individualization, two important forces behind genre evolution. Results show that this approach is effective and is worth further research. 1 Introduction The term `genre&apos; is employed in virtually all cultural fields: literature, music, art, architecture, dance, pedagogy, hypermedia studies, computermediated communication, and so forth. As has often been pointed out, it is hard to pin down the concept of genre from a unified perspective (cf. Kwasnik and Crowston, 2004). This lack is also experienced in the more restricted world of nonliterary or non-fictional document genres, such as professional or instrumental genres, where variation due to personal style is less pronounced than in literary genres. In particular, scholars working with practical genres focus upon a specific environment. For instance Swales (1990) develops his notion of genre in academic and research settings, Bathia (1993) in professional settings, and so on.

Genre-mixed web pages or web pages without any evident genre can represent the antecedent of a future genre, but currently they might be considered as belonging to a genre still in formation. It is also important to highlight, however, that since the acknowledgement of genre relies on social acceptance, it is impossible to define the exact point at which a new genre emerges (Crowston and Williams 2000).

Despite the lack of an agreed theoretical notion, genre is a well-established term, intuitively understood in its vagueness. What humans intuitively perceive is that there are categories created within a culture, a society or a community which are used to group documents that share some conventions. Each of these groups is a genre, i.e. a cultural object or artefact, purposely made to meet and streamline communicative needs. Genres show sets of standardized or conventional characteristics that make them recognizable, and this identity raises specific expectations. Together with conventions a</context>

In fact, the model can assign not only a single genre label, as in previous approaches to genre, but also multiple labels or no label at all. Ideally other computationally tractable attributes can be added to the tuple to increase flexibility and provide a multi-facetted classification, for example register or layout analysis. However, other issues remain open. First, the possibility of a comprehensive evaluation of the model is to be explored. So far, only tentative evaluation schemes exist for multi-label classification (e.g. McCallum, 1999). Further research is still needed. Second, in this model the detection of emerging genres can be done indirectly through the analysis of an unexpected combination of text types and/or genres.

While content words or terms show some drawbacks for automatic genre identification (cf. Boese and Howe, 2005), there are several types of linguistic features that return good results, for instance, Biberian features (Biber, 1988). In the model presented here we use a mixture of Biberian features and additional syntactic traits. The total number of features used in this implementation of the model is 100. These features are available online at: http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Marina.Santini/ 4 Inferential Model The inferential model presented here (partially discussed in Santini (2006a) combines the advantages of deductive and inductive approaches. It is deductive because the cooccurrence and the combination of features in text types is decided a priori by the linguist on the basis on previous studies, and not derived by a statistical procedure, which is too biased towards high frequencies (some linguistic phenomena can be rare, but they are nonetheless discriminating).

In future implementations hand-crafted rules can be replaced by other methods. For example, an interesting adaptive solution has been explored by Segal and Kephart (2000). Predictions. Precision of predictions on one web genre is used as an additional evaluation metric. The predictions on the eshop genre issued by the inferential model are compared with the predictions returned by two SVM models built with two different web page collections, Meyerzu-Eissen collection and the 7-web-genre collection (Santini, 2006).

While content words or terms show some drawbacks for automatic genre identification (cf. Boese and Howe, 2005), there are several types of linguistic features that return good results, for instance, Biberian features (Biber, 1988). In the model presented here we use a mixture of Biberian features and additional syntactic traits. The total number of features used in this implementation of the model is 100. These features are available online at: http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Marina.Santini/ 4 Inferential Model The inferential model presented here (partially discussed in Santini (2006a) combines the advantages of deductive and inductive approaches. It is deductive because the cooccurrence and the combination of features in text types is decided a priori by the linguist on the basis on previous studies, and not derived by a statistical procedure, which is too biased towards high frequencies (some linguistic phenomena can be rare, but they are nonetheless discriminating). It is also inductive because the inference process is corpus-based, which means that it is based on a pool of data used to predict some text types.

Before this acknowledgement, a genre shows hybrid or individualized forms, and indistinct functions. Putting all these traits together, we suggest the following broad theoretical characterization of genre of written texts: genres are named communication artefacts characterized by conventions, raising expectations, showing hybridism and individualization, and undergoing evolution. This characterization is flexible enough to encompass not only paper genres (both literary and practical genres), but also digital genres, and more specifically web genres. Web genres or cybergenres (Shepherd and Watters 1998) are those genres created by the combination of the use of the computer and the Internet. 699 Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Main Conference Poster Sessions, pages 699–706, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Genre hybridism and individualization are very evident on the web. In fact, web pages are often very hybrid because of the wider intra-genre variation and the smaller inter-genre differentiation. They can also be highly individualized because of the creative freedom provided by HTML tags (the building blocks of web pages) or programming languages such a</context>

Both these studies describe a similar process. Web genres can start either as reproductions or as unprecedented types of documents. In the first case, existing genres are gradually upgraded and modified to adapt to potentials offered by the web. These variants might become very different from the original genres with time passing by. In the second case, novel genres can be generated from specific needs and requirements of the web. Crowston and Williams (2000) have traced this evolution through a manual qualitative survey of 1000 web pages. Shepherd and Watters (1998) have proposed a fuzzy taxonomy for web genres. We would like to add a new force in this scenario, namely emerging genres. Emerging genre are those genres still in formation, not fully standardized and without any name or fixed function. For example, before 1998 web logs (or blogs) were already present on the web, but they were not yet identified as a genre. They were just &amp;quot;web pages&amp;quot;, with similar characteristics and functions. In 1999, suddenly a community sprang up using this new genre (Blood, 2000).

For example, a text can be produced to narrate, instruct, argue, etc. Narration, instruction, and argumentation are examples of text types. As stressed earlier, text types are usually considered separate entities from genres (cf. Biber, 1988; Lee, 2001). Form is a more heterogeneous attribute. Form can refer to linguistic form and to the shape (layout etc.). From an automatic point of view, linguistic form is represented by linguistic features, while shape is represented by HTML tags. Also the functionality attribute introduced by Shepherd and Watters (1998) can be seen in terms of HTML tags (e.g. tags for links and scripts). While content words or terms show some drawbacks for automatic genre identification (cf. Boese and Howe, 2005), there are several types of linguistic features that return good results, for instance, Biberian features (Biber, 1988).

They were just &amp;quot;web pages&amp;quot;, with similar characteristics and functions. In 1999, suddenly a community sprang up using this new genre (Blood, 2000). Only at this point, the genre &amp;quot;web log&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; started being spread and being recognized. Emerging genres may account for all those web pages, which remain unclassified or unclassifiable (cf. Crowston and Williams, 2000) because they show genre mixture or no genre at all. Authors often point out that assigning a genre to a web page might be difficult and controversial (e.g. Roussinov et al., 2001; Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004; Shepherd et al., 2004) because web pages can appear hybrid or peculiar. Genre-mixed web pages or web pages without any evident genre can represent the antecedent of a future genre, but currently they might be considered as belonging to a genre still in formation. It is also important to highlight, however, that since the acknowledgement of genre relies on social acceptance, it is impossible to define the exact point at which a new genre emerges (Crowston and Williams 2000). The multi-facetted model capable of hosting new genres wished for by Kwasnik and Crowston (2004), and the adaptive learning system that can ide</context>

As has often been pointed out, it is hard to pin down the concept of genre from a unified perspective (cf. Kwasnik and Crowston, 2004). This lack is also experienced in the more restricted world of nonliterary or non-fictional document genres, such as professional or instrumental genres, where variation due to personal style is less pronounced than in literary genres. In particular, scholars working with practical genres focus upon a specific environment. For instance Swales (1990) develops his notion of genre in academic and research settings, Bathia (1993) in professional settings, and so on. In automatic genre classification studies, genres have often been seen as non-topical categories that could help reduce information overload (e.g. Mayer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004; Lim et al., 2005). Despite the lack of an agreed theoretical notion, genre is a well-established term, intuitively understood in its vagueness. What humans intuitively perceive is that there are categories created within a culture, a society or a community which are used to group documents that share so</context>

Genres are not mutually exclusive and different genres can be merged into a single document, generating hybrid forms. Also, genres allow a certain freedom of variation and consequently can be individualized. Finally, genre repertoires are dynamic, i.e. they change over time, thus triggering genre change and evolution. It is also important to notice that before genre conventions become fully standardized, a genre does not have an official name. A genre name becomes acknowledged when the genre itself has an active role and a communicative function in a community or society (Swales, 1990). Before this acknowledgement, a genre shows hybrid or individualized forms, and indistinct functions. Putting all these traits together, we suggest the following broad theoretical characterization of genre of written texts: genres are named communication artefacts characterized by conventions, raising expectations, showing hybridism and individualization, and undergoing evolution.

All feature frequencies were normalized by the length of web pages (in tokens) and then submitted to the model. As stated earlier, the inferential model makes a clear-cut separation between text types and genres. The four text types included in this implementation are: descriptive_narrative, expository_informational, argumentative_persuasive, and instructional. The linguistic features for these text types come from previous (corpus-)linguistic studies (Werlich 1976; Biber, 1988; etc.), and are not extracted from the corpus using statistical methods. For each web page the model returns the probability of belonging to the four text types. For example, a web page can have 0.9 probabilities of being argumentative�persuasive, 0.7 of being instructional and so on. Probabilities are interpreted in terms of degree or gradation. For example, a web page with 0.9 probabilities 702 of being argumentative�persuasive shows a high gradation of argumentation. Gradations/ probabilities are ranked for each web page.
