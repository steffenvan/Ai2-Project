Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943">
In this paper a system for Named Entity
Recognition and Classification in Croatian
language is described. The system is com-
posed of the module for sentence segmen-
tation, inflectional lexicon of common
words, inflectional lexicon of names and
regular local grammars for automatic rec-
ognition of numerical and temporal expres-
sions. After the first step (sentence segmen-
tation), the system attaches to each token
its full morphosyntactic description and
appropriate lemma and additional tags for
potential categories for names without dis-
ambiguation. The third step (the core of the
system) is the application of a set of rules
for recognition and classification of named
entities in already annotated texts. Rules
based on described strategies (like internal
and external evidence) are applied in cas-
cade of transducers in defined order. Al-
though there are other classification sys-
tems for NEs, the results of our system are
annotated NEs which are following MUC-7
specification. System is applied on infor-
mative and noninformative texts and results
are compared. F-measure of the system ap-
plied on informative texts yields over 90%.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999474">
To produce a Named Entity Recognition and Clas-
sification (NERC) system for a lesser spread Slavic
language like Croatian could be a task which dif-
fers a lot from the task of building such a system
for a language like English, German or French.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999771037037037">
Compared to them, Croatian language has more
elaborated inflectional system and more freedom in
the word order within the sentence. Besides, the
resources and tools needed for producing such a
system (POS/MSD tagger, sentence segmentator,
chunker, lexicons or gazetteers etc.) are not widely
available.
But still we can say that even in languages with
that kind of structural properties like Slavic lan-
guages have, named entities (NE) form a subset of
natural language expressions that demonstrates
relatively predictable structures. It could be ques-
tioned whether the relatively free word order in
Croatian also covers the named entities (how much
it influences their internal structure and their posi-
tion in a sentence structure). What we also aim at
in this paper is to investigate the possibility to de-
scribe NE with relatively simple rule-based sys-
tems i.e. whether it is possible to describe and clas-
sify NE in Croatian using regular grammars.
The next part of the paper describes basic meth-
odology of our system. The third part presents
strategies for NERC which have been converted
into rules. The fourth part describes the archi-
tecture of the system while the fifth gives the re-
sults. The conclusion describes also possible future
directions.

2 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999297142857143">
This NERC system for Croatian is based on
hand-made rules encoded in transducers which are
applied in a cascade (Abney, 1996). The reason for
selecting this method was simple. Since this is the
first NERC system for Croatian, and there were no
previous solutions for any particular NE class, we
had to split the general NERC problem to a set of

smaller locally manageable problems covering not
just broad NE classes, but also their subclasses
which were recognized by characteristic patterns.
In such a way the set of rules could be kept under
control and modules covering different parts of a
problem could be called when needed in the
runtime. In the same time the development time is
shorter and the system is more consistent.
Every transducer in our system represents a lo-
cal grammar (Gross, 1993) dedicated to the de-
scription of a part of a sentence i.e. local linguistic
expression. The orientation to a local description
where the simpler (and more certain) cases are
solved first, followed by more complex ones, gives
more precision to the whole system. This “island
of certainty” principle (Abney, 1996:11) is also
used in our NERC system.
The system uses the principle of the “longest
match” as any other NERC system: in the case of
more than one possible expression recognized by
rules several different rules, system chooses the
longest one. In this way potentially ambiguous
NEs are being dynamically disambiguated (see e1
where Madunic Ltd. would be recognized and clas-
sified as organization NE because of the principle
of the “longest match” which also included Ltd and
thus avoiding matching only family name Madunic
from the lexicon of names).

3 Strategies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998966666666667">
In this section we will discuss the basic strategies
that have been used in different NERC systems and
their applicability for Croatian.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994557">
3.1 Internal and external evidence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991925">
The simple NER could be done by direct match of
text with the list of NEs. Even if we previously
solve the problem of inflection, such an approach
would result with a lot of errors. In the example
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.580455">
e1: Znali smo da je Madunic d.o.o. u
vlasništvu njegova oca. (We knew
that Madunić Ltd is a property of
his father.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993581384615385">
the expression Madunic could be wrongly recog-
nized and classified as a family name. Even that
result can be questionable since it may happen that
this very name is not in the list of family names.
Better results could be gained by using more in-
formation i.e. features which already exist in NEs.
One of features for personal names are titles such
as dr., mr., prof., ing. etc., for company names
characteristic strings are d.o.o. (Ltd), d.d. (S.A.,
GmBH) etc. Such explicit strings are called inter-
nal evidence (McDonald 1996:22) and usually
form a part of NE.
On the other hand the example such as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99097675">
e2: Danas je stiglo pismo iz
poduzeca &amp;quot;Duro Dakovic&amp;quot;. (A letter
from the firm &amp;quot;Đuro Đaković&amp;quot; arrived
today.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988261">
would yield simple person name Duro Dakovic if
the contextual information of NE (i.e. string po-
duzeca/the firm and usage of quotes) is not taken
into account. NEs often refer to certain classes
such as institutions, hospitals, schools, persons,
etc. Such contextual feature is called external evi-
dence (McDonald 1996:22) and its recognition is
mostly used as a classification criterion i.e. class
membership proof. In the case illustrated by the
following example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.593044">
e3: U klinici za infektivne bolesti
&amp;quot;Dr. Fran Mihaljevic&amp;quot; tog je dana
bila gužva. (It was crowded that day
at the clinic for infectuous dis-
eases &amp;quot;Dr. Fran Mihaljević&amp;quot;.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994666875">
the external evidence is often decisive for NERC.
In e3 the internal evidence (Dr.) represents a
strong argument for a person NE, but only contex-
tual external evidence (klinici/the clinic and
quotes) gives the right solution.
The external evidences are crucial for NERC in
any language but they also have an important role
during the system development. They can be useful
when a list of names is not complete – an external
evidence is taking the role of an additional proof.
They can also reduce the need for elaborated inter-
nal evidence checking when rules are being build.
The internal and external evidence is being used
by all NERC systems such as LTG (Mikheev et al.
1999), FASTUS (Hobbs et al. 1997), Proteus
(Yangarber, Grishman, 1998).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998658">
3.2 Dynamic lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895833333333">
Sometimes during the processing there is a need
for storing information which are relevant only for
a current text/discourse/document. Such informa-
tion are usually stored in a dynamic lexicon where
temporarily relevant information are stored and
used for the processing of a current document. Dy-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999948346153846">
namic lexicon entries are being collected from the
confident contexts and usually are being used for
tagging words which could be NEs but there is not
enough external evidences for that.
Dynamic lexicon could store all possible vari-
ants of a NE (a person) such as the full name and
family name including middle initial, only family
name, only name, only initials including all inflec-
tional word-forms etc. In the case of companies, it
could include the long company name, its shorter
version and/or acronym. Distribution of acronyms
shows that they frequently appear without internal
and/or external evidences which are present with
the full name (e.g. instead of the full name Investi-
cijsko-komercijalna banka, in the text there is only
Banka or only IKB). In such cases all tokens form-
ing an NE and all their combinations are stored in
the dynamic lexicon (Mikheev et al. 1999:5). In
our case it would be also Investicijsko-
komercijalna, komercijalna banka, Investicijska
banka, and also an acronym derived from the first
letters of all tokens (IKB).
Dynamic lexicon are used by a numer of NERC
systems such as ones described in (Mikheev et al.
1998), (McDonald 1996) and (Piskorski et al.
2000).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997955">
3.3 Global word sequence checking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999602833333333">
This strategy is used for solving complex ambigui-
ties (Mikheev, 1999). The initial position in the
sentence is one of such ambiguous spots. If the NE
is complex e.g. has a conjuncted structure, its solv-
ing can be quite a difficult task. The following ex-
ample from the newspaper can explain this:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.971229125">
e4: Osiguranje Zagreb i Primošten
potpisali su ugovor o suradnji. (In-
surance Zagreb and Primošten
countersigned an agreement on
cooperation.)
e5: Osiguranje Iviću i Horvatu nije
isplatilo naknadu. (Insurance didn’t
pay the benefit to Ivić and Horvat.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990941">
The token (Osiguranje) which in e4 is a part of NE
(Osiguranje Zagreb) is also a common noun and is
capitalized since it is in the initial sentence posi-
tion. The second NE (Primošten) is from the list of
locations but it could be also a part of conjunction
(Osiguranje Zagreb i Osiguranje Primošten)
which is shortened or forms a unique NE (Osigu-
ranje Zagreb i Primošten). In the e5 there is no
ambiguitiy since Iviću and Horvatu are person NEs
and being in dative case clearly show that they do
not belong to the same NE with Osiguranje (being
in nominative case).
Conjunction i (‘and’) can be syntactically inter-
preted in two ways: it can serve as a connector of
two separate NEs (Pliva i INA) or can be a part of
NE (Buhić i sinovi; Vodoopskrba i odvodnja). This
cases can be solved with a strategy that presup-
poses that at least there will be one unambiguous
position for the same NE in the text. Solving the e4
example could be formulated in several steps. 1)
all possible subsets of expression (Osiguranje Za-
greb i Primošten; Osiguranje Zagreb; Osiguranje
Primošten; Zagreb i Primošten; Primošten...)
should be stored in a dynamic lexicon; 2) if any of
this substrings is detected in the text in an unambi-
guous position:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988873714285714">
e6: Kapital Osiguranja Zagreb uvećan
je tri puta. (The capital of the In-
surance Zagreb is enlarged three
times.)
e7: Tvrtka Primošten d.d. izbjegla
je stečaj. (The firm Primošten d.d.
avoided the bankrupcy.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989408375">
the system can test that they are separate NEs and
resolve the role of conjunction.
A proper solution for categorising Primošten is
derived from this as well, since the coordinative
conjunction i will usually connect the NEs from
the same category (Mikheev, 1999).
This strategy is used in systems by Mikheev et
al. (1999) and Wacholder (1997).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995562">
3.4 One sense per discourse
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921461538461">
Ambiguous tokens, where the same string can refer
to a common noun in common usage or as a part of
NE, are quite common in texts (e.g. a token Sunce
in initial sentence position can be a common noun
but it has been recorded that it can also be a name
of investment fund or insurance company).
Since texts are meant to be understood by read-
ers (even when shortening and compressing proce-
dures are used by authors) it is very rare that the
same token has different meanings within the same
text. Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992) formed a
hypothesis that ambiguous words have a strong
tendency of keeping a single meaning in the same
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995634">

<bodyText confidence="0.9997432">
text/discourse. It has been experimentally proven
up to 98% of cases. Therefore, detecting at least
one unambiguous position for an ambiguous word
enables the system to successfully solve all other
ambiguous positions for this word.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991237">
3.5 Filtering of the false candidates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999434">
Specific type of problem for NERC systems pose
expressions which have a structure similar to NE,
but are not NEs:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.944751142857143">
e8: Pripreme za Atenu 2004 pribli-
žavaju se završetku. (Preparations
for the Athens 2004 are coming to
the end.)
e9: Pogled nam se pružao na cijelu
Atenu. (A view to the whole Athens
was in front of us.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990963818181818">
In e8 string Atenu 2004 refers to the Olympic
games held in Athens 2004 and not to location NE.
According to MUC specification, this should not
be marked as NE. In e9 Atenu refers to location
and should be marked as NE.
There are two possible solutions for elimination
of this cases: 1) a context should be expressive
enough that it can be covered by a special rule; 2) a
list of false NE candidates i.e. NE-like expressions
which have to be eliminated from the further proc-
essing.
It is better to discard the false NE candidates at
the beginning (Karkaletis et al 1999:130) because
it reduces the need for further processing and test-
ing. The false NE candidates should not have to be
deleted from the text, a better solution is to mark
them with a special tag which will be deleted just
before output but in the same time it will signal to
the system to avoid the processing of that part of
text.
Processing of false NE candidates is described
thoroughly in (Stevenson, Gaizauskas, 1999:293).

4 Architecture of the system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999243586206897">
For developing, testing and applying our NERC
system we were using Intex, a well known devel-
opment environment for making formal descrip-
tions of natural languages using FSTs and their
immediate application on large corpora in real-time
(Silberztein 2000:8).
Our system was designed to allow the modular
processing of Croatian on three levels: 1) token
(single-word units) segmentation; 2) sentence
segmentation; 3) multi-word units (collocations,
syntagms). These modules were designed for this
system but they can be used individually in any
other system for processing Croatian.
Lists of personal and family names are also im-
portant for this system. We were using a list of
15,000 male and female personal names accompa-
nied by 56,000 family names registered in the Re-
public of Croatia (Boras; Mikelić; Lauc 2003:224).
This list was expanded to a full word-form list for
every name according to the MulTextEast specifi-
cation for lexica (Erjavec et al. 2003).
The rules were manually developed and tested
on a subcorpus of Croatian National Corpus (Tadić,
2002) which size was 60 million of tokens of
newspaper texts. The rules were coded as Finite
State Transducers using Intex’s graphical interface.
The system (see figure 1) consists of several se-
quenced modules which are applied after the to-
kenizaton and sentence segmentation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.928282428571428">
1. Lexical processing: application of lexi-
cons of common words and proper
names. Unrecognized tokens are further
processed with transducers which are
based on characteristic endings for MSD
categorization.
2. Rules (phase 1) which have the highest
certainty i.e. process unambiguous text
segments are being applied after the
preprocessing stage. In this manner a
large part of all NEs is being detected
thus giving the firm anchors for the rules
(phase 2);
3. Lexicon filtering: some lexical entries
are highly ambiguous and make applica-
tion of relaxed rules even more complex
(e.g. Kina in Croatian can be a common
noun and location NE as well. Filtering
such highly frequent and ambiguous
common words significantly increases
results in the second phase.

4. Rules (phase 2): all unrecognized NEs
in phase 1 (mostly because of lack of
supportive co-text information) are
processed with new rules which are re-
laxed. Constraints are relaxed, but
thanks to filtered lexicon precision are
still rather high.
Since the overall number of rules is 106 and the
description of their precise ordering and mutual
interdependence would surpass the limitations of
this article, we would like to exemplify the general
format of the rules with the rule for detecting per-
son NEs which include external evidence such as
function of that person. Since functions can appear
before or after the person NE, this rule has been
stored as a separate local grammar which is being
called as needed.
Beside the function name, an attribute &lt;A&gt; can
appear on the left and NP in genitive case [NPg]
can appear on the right of function name.
This local grammar ([funkcije] in grey) is being
called in cascade from two other grammars for per-
son NE detection such as:

Similar set of rules and modular local grammars
has been developed for other NE categories.
The order of applying rules (i.e. local grammars)
plays important role in our NERC system. There
are at least two reasons for that.
1) Certain rule can be valid for a NE which can
be part of a larger NE. Rules for organization NE
detection should be applied prior to rules for per-
son NE detection. In this way correct categorisa-
tion is being achieved (e.g. Đuro Đaković holding
d.d. where a person NE should not be used and
subsumed under larger organization NE). Even if
both grammars are applied simultaneously, still the
principle of “longest match” would yield the cor-
rect categorisation (Poibeau, 2000). The same or-
dering should be kept in mind for other types of
NEs which could be subsumed (e.g. dates or loca-
tions within the names of streets etc.).
2) The degree of certainty is decisive for rule
ordering: the most certain NEs are being processed
at the beginning and thus lowers the ambiguity also
within the same category.

5 Results and discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845307692308">
Our NERC system for Croatian was tested on two
types of texts: newspaper articles from Večernji list
(economy and internal affairs, 350 articles from
2005-01, 137.547 tokens) and two textbooks from
the history of arts and culture (143.919 tokens)
(Maković, 1997; Žmegač, 1998). The results for
newspaper texts are given in Table 1, while results
for textbooks are given in Table 2.
F-measure of the whole system calculated as av-
erage from F-measures of all categories is 0.92.
Since all NE categories are not equally represented
in texts, more realistic measure of system effi-
ciency can be acquired by counting all NEs that
current version of a system with this set of rules
should detect and categorize in a text. In this case
F-measure drops to 0.90 which is still very good
result.
The same rules applied to another genre (text-
books) show a significant drop in the accuracy of
the system. Precision is still at 0.79 but recall is at
0.47 thus resulting with F-measure at 0.59. The
most serious drop is in personal and location
names. Possible explanation could be that in text-
books used for testing there is a lot of unknown,
possibly foreign, names but this has to be checked
in detail on more different genres.
Compared to a similar system for NERC in
French texts (Poibeau; Kosseim 2001:148), where
also Intex was used as a development environment,
we got similar results. System developed for
French yielded 0.9 for informative texts and 0.5 in
noninformative texts (prose).
The example of the input and output from our
system can be seen at http://hnk.ffzg.hr/nerc/.
Theoretically syntactic rules in Croatian do al-
low central embedding in NPs thus splitting them
in two separate strings. If we apply this rule to a
NERC domain, we could think of a construction
which consist of function and personal name:

In practice constructions of this type were never

This led us to a conclusion that in spite the rela-
tively free word order in Croatian, for NERC sys-
tems regular grammars could be sufficient instead
of stronger formalism such as context-free gram-
mars. NEs are local phenomena in sentences and
are usually kept in one constituent. It looks like the
free word order allows recombination of constitu-
ents (scrambling) while withing the constituents it
is not allowed and they could be locally recognized
by regular grammars. Although context-free
grammars encompass regular ones, the develop-
ment time for regular grammars, particularly if
they are built as small-scale local grammars which
are cascaded later, is much shorter and developers
have stronger control over of each module, its in-
put and output.

6 Future directions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999814411764706">
Although it features in some areas quite promising
results, this system if far from being complete. Our
future directions could be: 1) testing the system on
a whole different range of genres with possible rule
adaptation for each genre; 2) widening the list of
person and family names to include foreign names;
3) thorough analysis and typology of most typical
errors; 4) include also other NEs classification
schemes which go beyond MUC-7 specification; 5)
since this system highly depends on Intex runtime
library under which it has been designed, it is not
possible to distribute it as a stand-alone application.
We would like to reprogram the whole set of rules
on a different platform or programming language.
In this way this system can became a core of a
web-based service for NERC in Croatian which is
also one of our intentions.

<abstract confidence="0.991755785714285">In this paper a system for Named Entity Recognition and Classification in Croatian language is described. The system is composed of the module for sentence segmentation, inflectional lexicon of common words, inflectional lexicon of names and regular local grammars for automatic recognition of numerical and temporal expressions. After the first step (sentence segmentation), the system attaches to each token its full morphosyntactic description and appropriate lemma and additional tags for potential categories for names without disambiguation. The third step (the core of the system) is the application of a set of rules for recognition and classification of named entities in already annotated texts. Rules based on described strategies (like internal and external evidence) are applied in cascade of transducers in defined order. Although there are other classification systems for NEs, the results of our system are annotated NEs which are following MUC-7 specification. System is applied on informative and noninformative texts and results are compared. F-measure of the system applied on informative texts yields over 90%.</abstract>

In such a way the set of rules could be kept under control and modules covering different parts of a problem could be called when needed in the runtime. In the same time the development time is shorter and the system is more consistent. Every transducer in our system represents a local grammar (Gross, 1993) dedicated to the description of a part of a sentence i.e. local linguistic expression. The orientation to a local description where the simpler (and more certain) cases are solved first, followed by more complex ones, gives more precision to the whole system. This “island of certainty” principle (Abney, 1996:11) is also used in our NERC system.

The external evidences are crucial for NERC in any language but they also have an important role during the system development. They can be useful when a list of names is not complete – an external evidence is taking the role of an additional proof. They can also reduce the need for elaborated internal evidence checking when rules are being build. The internal and external evidence is being used by all NERC systems such as LTG (Mikheev et al. 1999), FASTUS (Hobbs et al. 1997), Proteus (Yangarber, Grishman, 1998). 3.2 Dynamic lexicon Sometimes during the processing there is a need for storing information which are relevant only for a current text/discourse/document. Such information are usually stored in a dynamic lexicon where temporarily relevant information are stored and used for the processing of a current document.

The same ordering should be kept in mind for other types of NEs which could be subsumed (e.g. dates or locations within the names of streets etc.). 2) The degree of certainty is decisive for rule ordering: the most certain NEs are being processed at the beginning and thus lowers the ambiguity also within the same category. 5 Results and discussion Our NERC system for Croatian was tested on two types of texts: newspaper articles from Večernji list (economy and internal affairs, 350 articles from 2005-01, 137.547 tokens) and two textbooks from the history of arts and culture (143.919 tokens) (Maković, 1997; Žmegač, 1998). The results for newspaper texts are given in Table 1, while results for textbooks are given in Table 2. F-measure of the whole system calculated as average from F-measures of all categories is 0.92. Since all NE categories are not equally represented in texts, more realistic measure of system efficiency can be acquired by counting all NEs that current version of a system with this set of rules should detect and categorize in a text. In this case F-measure drops to 0.90 which is still very good result. The same rules applied to another genre (textbooks) show a significant drop </context>

(We knew that Madunić Ltd is a property of his father.) the expression Madunic could be wrongly recognized and classified as a family name. Even that result can be questionable since it may happen that this very name is not in the list of family names. Better results could be gained by using more information i.e. features which already exist in NEs. One of features for personal names are titles such as dr., mr., prof., ing. etc., for company names characteristic strings are d.o.o. (Ltd), d.d. (S.A., GmBH) etc. Such explicit strings are called internal evidence (McDonald 1996:22) and usually form a part of NE. On the other hand the example such as: e2: Danas je stiglo pismo iz poduzeca &amp;quot;Duro Dakovic&amp;quot;. (A letter from the firm &amp;quot;Đuro Đaković&amp;quot; arrived today.) would yield simple person name Duro Dakovic if the contextual information of NE (i.e. string poduzeca/the firm and usage of quotes) is not taken into account. NEs often refer to certain classes such as institutions, hospitals, schools, persons, etc. Such contextual feature is called external evidence (McDonald 1996:22) and its recognition is mostly used as a classification criterion i.e. class membership proof.

In such cases all tokens forming an NE and all their combinations are stored in the dynamic lexicon (Mikheev et al. 1999:5). In our case it would be also Investicijskokomercijalna, komercijalna banka, Investicijska banka, and also an acronym derived from the first letters of all tokens (IKB).

In such cases all tokens forming an NE and all their combinations are stored in the dynamic lexicon (Mikheev et al. 1999:5). In our case it would be also Investicijskokomercijalna, komercijalna banka, Investicijska banka, and also an acronym derived from the first letters of all tokens (IKB).

There are at least two reasons for that. 1) Certain rule can be valid for a NE which can be part of a larger NE. Rules for organization NE detection should be applied prior to rules for person NE detection. In this way correct categorisation is being achieved (e.g. Đuro Đaković holding d.d. where a person NE should not be used and subsumed under larger organization NE). Even if both grammars are applied simultaneously, still the principle of “longest match” would yield the correct categorisation (Poibeau, 2000). The same ordering should be kept in mind for other types of NEs which could be subsumed (e.g. dates or locations within the names of streets etc.). 2) The degree of certainty is decisive for rule ordering: the most certain NEs are being processed at the beginning and thus lowers the ambiguity also within the same category. 5 Results and discussion Our NERC system for Croatian was tested on two types of texts: newspaper articles from Večernji list (economy and internal affairs, 350 articles from 2005-01, 137.547 tokens) and two textbooks from the history of arts and culture (143.919 tokens) (</context>

Processing of false NE candidates is described thoroughly in (Stevenson, Gaizauskas, 1999:293). 4 Architecture of the system For developing, testing and applying our NERC system we were using Intex, a well known development environment for making formal descriptions of natural languages using FSTs and their immediate application on large corpora in real-time (Silberztein 2000:8). Our system was designed to allow the modular processing of Croatian on three levels: 1) token (single-word units) segmentation; 2) sentence segmentation; 3) multi-word units (collocations, syntagms). These modules were designed for this system but they can be used individually in any other system for processing Croatian. Lists of personal and family names are also important for this system. We were using a list of 15,000 male and female personal names accompanied by 56,000 family names registered in the Republic of Croatia (Boras; Mikelić; Lauc 2003:224). This list was expanded to a full </context>

We were using a list of 15,000 male and female personal names accompanied by 56,000 family names registered in the Republic of Croatia (Boras; Mikelić; Lauc 2003:224). This list was expanded to a full word-form list for every name according to the MulTextEast specification for lexica (Erjavec et al. 2003). The rules were manually developed and tested on a subcorpus of Croatian National Corpus (Tadić, 2002) which size was 60 million of tokens of newspaper texts. The rules were coded as Finite State Transducers using Intex’s graphical interface. The system (see figure 1) consists of several sequenced modules which are applied after the tokenizaton and sentence segmentation: 1. Lexical processing: application of lexicons of common words and proper names. Unrecognized tokens are further processed with transducers which are based on characteristic endings for MSD categorization. 2. Rules (phase 1) which have the highest certainty i.e. process unambiguous text segments are being applied after the pre</context>

The results for newspaper texts are given in Table 1, while results for textbooks are given in Table 2. F-measure of the whole system calculated as average from F-measures of all categories is 0.92. Since all NE categories are not equally represented in texts, more realistic measure of system efficiency can be acquired by counting all NEs that current version of a system with this set of rules should detect and categorize in a text. In this case F-measure drops to 0.90 which is still very good result. The same rules applied to another genre (textbooks) show a significant drop in the accuracy</context>
