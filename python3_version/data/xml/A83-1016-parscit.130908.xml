This paper Identifies the types of sentence
fragments found In the text of two domains: medical
records and Navy equipment status messages. The
fragment types are related to full sentence forms
on the basis of the elements which were regularly
deleted. A breakdown of the fragment types and
their distributions In the two domains is
presented. An approach to reconstructing the
semantic class of deleted elements In the medical

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887">
A large amount of natural language input,
whether to text processing or question-answering
systems, consists of shortened sentence forms,
sentence &amp;quot;fragments&amp;quot;. Sentence fragments are found
In Informal technical communications, messages,
headlines, and In telegraphic communications.
Occurrences are characterized by their brevity and
Informational nature. In all of these, If people
are not restricted to using complete, grammatical
sentences, as they are In formal writing
situations, they tend to leave out the parts of the
sentence which they believe the reader will be able
to reconstruct. This is especially true If the
writer deals with a specialized subject matter
where the facts are to be used by others in the
same field.

natural language Input have been followed. The
LIFER system [Hendrix, 1977; Hendrix, at al.. 1978]
and the PLANES system [Waltz, 1978] both account
for fragments In procedural terms; they do not
require the user to enumerate the types of
fragments which will be accepted. The Linguistic
String Project has characterized the regularly
occurring ungrammatical constructions and made them
part of the parsing grammar [Anderson, at al..
1975; Hirschman and Sager, 1982]. Kwasny and
Sondhelmer (1981) have used error-handling
procedures to relate the ill-formed input of
sentence fragments to well-formed structures.
While these approaches differ in the way they
determine the structure of the fragments and the
deleted material, for the most part they rely
heavily, at some point, on the recognition of
semantic word-classes. The purpose of this paper
Is to describe the syntactic characteristics of
sentence fragments and to Illustrate how the
domain-specific Information embodied In the
cooccurrence patterns of the semantic word-classes
of a domain can be utilized as a powerful tool for
processing a body of compact text, i.e. text that
contains a large percentage of sentence fragments.

IDENTIFICATION OF FRAGMENT TYPES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.67801">
The New York University Linguistic String
Project has developed a computer program to analyze
compact text In specialized subject areas using a
general parsing program and an English grammar
augmented by procedures specific to the subject
areas. In recent years the system has been
tailored for computer analysis of free-text medical
records, which are characterized by numerous
sentence fragments. In the computer-analysis and
processing of the medical records, relatively few
types of sentence fragments sufficed to describe
the shortened forms, although such fragments
comprised fully 49% of the natural language input
[Marsh and Sager, 1982]. Fragment types can be
related to full forms on the basis of the elements
which are regularly deleted. Elements deleted from
the fragments are from one or more of the syntactic
positions: subject, tense, verb, object. The six
fragment types identified in the set of medical
records are shown In Table 1 as types 1-VI.
A feature of fragment types that is not
immediately obvious Is the fact that they are
already known in the full grammar as parts of
fuller constructions. The fragment types reflect
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.8681914">
deletions found in syntactically distinguished
positions within full sentences, as Illustrated In
Table 2. For example, in normal English, a sentence
that contains tense and the verb ta. can occur as
the object of verbs like find (e.g. .Sha found that
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.929986294117647">
Ihe sentence 103 mmhiquous,). In the same
environment, as object of find, a reduced sentence
can occur In which the tense and verb te have been
omitted, as In fragment type I (e.g. ihe found the
intenre ambiguous.). In the same manner, other
reduced forms reflected In fragment types also
represent constructions generally found as parts of
regular English sentences.
The fact that the fragment types can be
related to full English forms makes it possible to
view them as instances of reduced
SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT patterns from which particular
components have been deleted. Fragments of type I
can be represented as having a deleted tense and
verb ta, of type II as having a deleted subject,
tense, and verb ta, etc. This makes it relatively
straightforward to add them to the parsing grammar,

and, at the same time, provides a framework for
identifying their semantic content by relating them
to the corresponding full forms.
The number of fragment types that occur in
compact text of different technical domains appears
to be relatively limited. When the fragment types
found in medical records were compared with those
seen in a small sample of Navy equipment status
messages, five of the six types found in the
medical records were also found in the Navy
messages. Only one additional fragment type was
required to cover the Navy messages. This type
appears In Table 1 as type VII, In which two
subjects have been deleted (Request advise
=Ammonia ini nick no).
While the number of fragment types Is
relatively constant, the distribution of fragment
types varies according to the domain of the text.
Table 3 shows distributions for each of the
fragment types identified in Table 1. For example,
In Table 3, while fragment type IV, from which
subject, tense, and verb have been deleted, is most
frequent in medical records, It Is a much less
frequent type in the Navy messages. On the other
hand, type VI, from which a subject has been
deleted, Is relatively Infrequent in medical
records, but much more frequent in Navy messages.
In addition, the different sections of the
input differ with respect to the ratio of fragments
to whole sentences and in the types of froGments
they contain. For example, the different sections
of the medical records that were analyzed (e.g.
HISTORY, EXAM, LAS—DATA, IMPRESSION, COURSE IN
HOSPITAL) were distinguished by differences in the
distribution of the fragment types. The EXAM
paragraph of the medical texts, In which the
physician describes the results of the patient&apos;s
physical examination, contained a relatively large
number of fragments of type iii, especially
adjective phrases. The COURSE IN HOSPITAL
paragraph contained a larger number of complete
sentences than the other paragraphs.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998713698924731">
The deletions which relate fragment types to
their full sentence forms fall into two main
classes: (1) those found virtually in all texts and
(ii) those specific to the domain of the text.
Just as the fragment types can be viewed as
incomplete realizations of syntactic S-V-0
structures, the semantic patterns In sentence
fragments can be considered incomplete realizations
of the semantic S-V-0 patterns. In general terms,
the structure of information in technical domains
can be specified by a set of semantic classes, the
words and phrases which belong to these classes,
and by a specification of the patterns these
classes enter into, i.e. the syntactic
relationships among the members of the classes
[Grishman, et al., 1982; Sager, 1978]. In the case
of the medical sublanguage processed by the
Linguistic String Project, the medical subclasses
were derived through techniques of distributional
analysis [Hirschman and Sager, 1982]. Semantic
S-V-0 patterns were then derived from the
combinatory properties of the medical classes in
the text [Marsh and Sager, 1982]; the semantic
patterns identified in a text are specific to the
domain of the text. While they serve to formulate
sublanguage constraints which rule out incorrect
syntactic analyses caused by structural or lexical
ambiguity, these relationships among classes can
also provide a means by which deleted elements In
compact text can be reconstructed. When a fragment
Is recognized as an Instance of a given semantic
pattern, It Is then possible to specify a set of
the semantic classes from which the medical
sublanguage class of the deleted element can be
selected.
On a superficial level, the deletions of le In
fragment types Ic-f and Illa-b, for example, can be
reconstructed on purely syntactic grounds by
filling in the lexical item le. However, It is
also possible to provide further information and
specify the semantic class of the lexical item Jul
by reference to the semantic S-V-0 pattern
manifested by the occurring subject and object.
For example, In type If fragment skin eg eruntiorm,
IhIn has the medical subclass BODYPART, and
=rattans has the medical subclass SIGN/SYMPTOM.
The semantic S-V-0 pattern In which these classes
play a part is:
BODYPART-SHOWVERB-SIGN/SYMPTOM
(as in .in shwa ng Araangns). Ba can then be
assigned the semantic class SHOWVERB. Protein 2.1,
type le, enters into the semantic pattern:
TEST-TESTVERB-TESTRESULT
and be can be assigned the class TESTVERB, which
relates a TEST subject with a TESTRESULT object.
Assigning a semantic class to the reconstructed Jae
maximizes its informational content.
In addition to reconstructing a distinguished
lexical Item, like the verb le, along with Its
semantic classes, it is also possible to specify
the set of semantic classes for a deleted element,
even though a lexical item is not Immediately
reconstructable. For example, the fragment at
receive fol.iq =la, of Type Vi, contains a verb of
the PTVERB class and a MEDICATION object, but the
subject has been deleted. The only semantic
pattern which permits a verb and object with these
medical subclasses Is the S-V-0 pattern:
PATIENT-PTVERB-MEDICATION
Through recognition of the semantic pattern in
which the occurring elements of the fragment play a
role, the semantic class PATIENT can be specified
for the deleted subject. Patient Is one of the
distinguished words in the domain of narrative
medical records which are often not explicitly
mentioned in the text, although they play a role In
the semantic patterns.
The S-V-0 relations, of which the fragment
types are incomplete realizations, form the basis
of a procedure which specifies the semantic classes
of deleted elements In fragments. Under the best
conditions, the set of semantic classes for the
deleted form contains only one element. It Is also
possible, however, for the set to contain more than
one semantic class. For example, the type la
fragment EAIn A150 =Ad In hAnAl And knAAA, when
regularized to normal active S-V-0 word order as
=IAA Join In lanada nnn tnoz, has a deleted
subject. The set of possible medical classes for
the deleted subject consists of )_PATIENT, FAMILY,
DOCTOR}, since a fragment with a verb of the
OBSERVE class, such as note, and an object of the
SIGN/SYMPTOM class, such as gain, can enter frtc

any of the S -V -0 patterns In Figure 1. The choice
of one subclass for the deleted element from among
elements of the set of possible subclasses is
dependent on several factors. First, properties of
paragraph structure of the text place restrictions
on the selection of semantic class for a deleted
element. The fragment noted golo In hands And
nnon would select a DOCTOR subject If written in
the IMPRESSION or EXAM paragraph of the text, but,
In the HISTORY paragraph, a PATIENT or FAMILY
subject could not be excluded. A second factor Is
the presence of an antecedent having one of the
semantic classes specified for the deleted element.
If a possible antecedent having the same semantic
class can be found, subject to restrictions on
change of topic and discourse structure, then the
deleted element can be filled In by its antecedent,
restricting the semantic class of the deleted
element to that of the antecedent. However, an
antecedent search may not always be successful,
since the antecedent may not have been explicitly
mentioned in the text. The antecedent may be one
of a class of distinguished words in the
sublanguage, such as pmtlent and doctor, which may
not be previously mentioned In the body of the
text.
Thus, semantic patterns derived from
distributional analysis permit the specification of
a set of semantic classes for deleted elements In
texts characterized by a large proportion of
sentence fragments. This specification can
facilitate the reconstruction of deleted elements
by limiting choice among possible antecedents.

In recent years the system has been tailored for computer analysis of free-text medical records, which are characterized by numerous sentence fragments. In the computer-analysis and processing of the medical records, relatively few types of sentence fragments sufficed to describe the shortened forms, although such fragments comprised fully 49% of the natural language input [Marsh and Sager, 1982]. Fragment types can be related to full forms on the basis of the elements which are regularly deleted. Elements deleted from the fragments are from one or more of the syntactic positions: subject, tense, verb, object. The six fragment types identified in the set of medical records are shown In Table 1 as types 1-VI. A feature of fragment types that is not immediately obvious Is the fact that they are already known in the full grammar as parts of fuller constructions. The fragment types reflect deletions found in syntactically distinguished positions within full sentences, as Illustrated In T</context>

In the case of the medical sublanguage processed by the Linguistic String Project, the medical subclasses were derived through techniques of distributional analysis [Hirschman and Sager, 1982]. Semantic S-V-0 patterns were then derived from the combinatory properties of the medical classes in the text [Marsh and Sager, 1982]; the semantic patterns identified in a text are specific to the domain of the text. While they serve to formulate sublanguage constraints which rule out incorrect syntactic analyses caused by structural or lexical ambiguity, these relationships among classes can also provide a means by which deleted elements In compact text can be reconstructed. When a fragment Is recognized as an Instance of a given semantic pattern, It Is then possible to specify a set of the semantic classes from which the medical sublanguage class of the deleted element can be selected. On a superficial level, the deleti</context>

Just as the fragment types can be viewed as incomplete realizations of syntactic S-V-0 structures, the semantic patterns In sentence fragments can be considered incomplete realizations of the semantic S-V-0 patterns. In general terms, the structure of information in technical domains can be specified by a set of semantic classes, the words and phrases which belong to these classes, and by a specification of the patterns these classes enter into, i.e. the syntactic relationships among the members of the classes [Grishman, et al., 1982; Sager, 1978].

In all of these, If people are not restricted to using complete, grammatical sentences, as they are In formal writing situations, they tend to leave out the parts of the sentence which they believe the reader will be able to reconstruct. This is especially true If the writer deals with a specialized subject matter where the facts are to be used by others in the same field. Several approaches to such &amp;quot;Ill-formed&amp;quot; natural language Input have been followed. The LIFER system [Hendrix, 1977; Hendrix, at al.. 1978] and the PLANES system [Waltz, 1978] both account for fragments In procedural terms; they do not require the user to enumerate the types of fragments which will be accepted. The Linguistic String Project has characterized the regularly occurring ungrammatical constructions and made them part of the parsing grammar [Anderson, at al.. 1975; Hirschman and Sager, 1982]. Kwasny and Sondhelmer (1981) have used error-handling procedures to relate the ill-formed input of sentence fragments to well-formed structures. While these approaches differ in the way they determine the structure of the fragments and the deleted material, for the </context>
