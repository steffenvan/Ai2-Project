Minutes of the 1984 ACL Meeting
</title>
<bodyText confidence="0.955563">
Following are the minutes of the 22nd Annual Business
Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguis-
tics, held 5 July 1984 at Stanford University in Stanford,
California, in conjunction with COLING84, the 10th
International Conference on Computational Linguistics.
Martha Evens, ACL President, presided.

COLING84 Committee Report
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989025">
COLING84, the first held in the United States since the
inaugural meeting in 1965, is proving to be an unques-
tioned success. The attendance of about 450 is one-and-
a-half times larger than any previous COLING. Of the
270 papers submitted, 105 were accepted, 17 as long
papers, 88 as short ones. Two innovations, an exhibit
program and a mini-summer school, were noteworthy
additions to the conference.

Secretary-Treasurer&apos;s Report
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986461538462">
The demands of COLING84, coupled with the Secretary-
Treasurer&apos;s imminent move to New Jersey, resulted in the
presentation of a summary report instead of the usual
detailed presentation. Income for 1983 was approxi-
mately $130,000 and expenses $85,000, for a surplus of
about $45,000. Total assets at the end of the year were
over $100,000, a total that does not take into consider-
ation all of the costs for production and distribution of
the 1983 journal issues. Membership for 1983 was
approximately 1300; the late mailing of the dues state-
ment for 1984 (deliberate because of the lateness of the
journal production cycle), makes it inappropriate to pres-
ent any figures for 1984.

The first volume in the ACL/Cambridge University Press
series is in page proof: Natural Language Processing--
Psychological, Computational, and Theoretical Perspec-

Arnold Zwicky. Kathleen McKeown&apos;s Generating
Natural Language, and Douglas Appelt&apos;s Planning
Natural Language Utterances, are both in various stages
of production. Space and Prepositions in English, by
Annette Herskovits, and An Introduction to Computa-
tional Linguistics, by Ralph Grishman, should provide
final copy shortly. Manuscript submissions are encour-

issue of Computational Linguistics is ready to be sent to
the printers. Site reports are beginning to appear in The
FINITE STRING; more are encouraged, as are abstracts
for the &amp;quot;Abstracts of Current Literature&amp;quot; section. Books
that need reviewing are available; interested people are
urged to contact Lyn Bates, the Book Review Editor.

The 1985 Annual Meeting is scheduled for the University
of Chicago, 8-12 July; Bill Mann is Program Chair;
Martha Evens is responsible for Local Arrangements.
Both the University of Delaware and New York City are
being considered as sites for the 1986 meeting. The
Linguistic Society of America&apos;s Summer Linguistic Insti-
tute will be held in New York in 1986, and computa-
tional linguistics will be a major focus of its program.

The European Chapter

<bodyText confidence="0.9901557">
This second anniversary of the ACL European Chapter
finds the organization flourishing. Over 100 people
attended the Chapter&apos;s first meeting in Pisa, 1-2 Septem-
ber 1983. A second conference is scheduled for 28-29
March 1985 in Geneva. Margaret King is Program
Chair; Mike Rosner is responsible for Local Arrange-
ments. An attendance of 200-300 is projected. Forty-
seven new members were added in 1983 for a total of
418; the Chapter treasury in Switzerland shows a
balance corresponding to $7000.

AFIPS Developments

<bodyText confidence="0.9990969">
The most recent distribution of surplus from the National
Computer Conferences has provided ACL with $50,000.
The new AFIPS President, Stephen Yau, was prevented
by illness from attending COLING84 and being present
for the Business Meeting; he sent his regards instead.
AFIPS is considering responding to a White House Initi-
ative on Community Action to increase the public&apos;s
understanding of computers. ACL members are encour-
aged to participate in AFIPS Committees; anyone inter-
ested should contact Norm Sondheimer.

The Secretary-Treasurer reiterated the need for a state-
ment on careers that could be distributed by the ACL
office, as well as brief descriptions, with selected bibli-
ographies, for a broad range of topics in computational
linguistics. Many requests for such information are
received each year.
Carol Lane described CALICO, the newly formed
Computer-Assisted Language and Instruction Consorti-
um, and its journal, CALICO. A conference is scheduled
for January/February 1985 in Baltimore, and a summer
institute will be held in 1985. A data base containing
information on the use of computers in language instruc-
tion will be available online soon. ACL members with an
interest in this area should consider joining this new soci-
ety.
Raoul Smith remarked on the success of the first
Conference on Computer/Human Interaction held in
December 1983, which ACL co-sponsored, and
announced that the next CHI conference would be held
14-18 April 1985. He invited ACL members to submit
papers on natural language interfaces, text generation,
voice quality in speech synthesis and recognition, and
related topics.
