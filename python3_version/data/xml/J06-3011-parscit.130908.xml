In the Squib by Yves Bestgen (“Improving Text Segmentation Using Latent Semantic
Analysis: A Reanalysis of Choi, Wiemer-Hastings, and Moore” (2001) in Issue 32:1
[March 2006]), the author refers to two papers by Choi et al. as appearing in NAACL
2001. However, only one is listed. The Choi, Wiemer-Hastings, and Moore (2001)
citation should be as follows:
Choi, Freddy Y. Y., Peter Wiemer-Hastings, and Johanna Moore. 2001. Latent semantic analysis
for text segmentation. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language
Processing, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, pages 109–117.
