<bodyText confidence="0.999915333333333">
In our current research into the design of cognitively well-mo-
tivated interfaces relying primarily on the display of graphical
information, we have observed that graphical information
alone does not provide sufficient support to users — particu-
larly when situations arise that do not simply conform to the
users&apos; expectations. This can occur due to too much informa-
tion being requested, too little, information of the wrong kind,
etc. To solve this problem, we are working towards the integra-
tion of natural language generation to augment the interaction
functionalities of the interface. This is intended to support the
generation of flexible natural language utterances which pin-
point possible problems with a user&apos;s request and which fur-
ther go on to outline the user&apos;s most sensible courses of action
away from the problem. In this paper, we describe our first pro-
totype, where we combine the graphical and interaction plan-
ning capabilities of our graphical information system SIC!
with the text generation capabilities of the Penman system. We
illustrate the need for such a combined system, and also give
examples of how a general natural language facility beneficial-
ly augments the user&apos;s ability to navigate a knowledge base
graphically.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997024475">
Natural language interfaces to information systems allow the
user to converse with the system in a natural way without being
restricted by the syntax of a formal query language. However,
users often have difficulties in stating their information need
precisely (cf. Brooks et al., 1986) and so a user interface design
emphasizing multimedia aspects of information systems may
be more appropriate. An object oriented presentation meets
this requirement because users are allowed to investigate in-
formation items directly. Thus, the distance between the users&apos;
intentions and the objects they involve is reduced to a mini-
mum (cf. Hutchins et al., 1986). However, visual presentations
of abstract information items have to be designed carefully to
support the user in perceiving them correctly. Often the in-
herent limitations of available presentation forms, e.g. the
number of displayable items, are an impediment to an adequate
visualization. These difficulties which are well known in visu-
al languages can be attacked by combining the presentation of
graphical objects to the user with cooperative system re-
sponses in natural languages.
Our approach to human-computer interaction provides
the basis for an integration of different interaction styles, in our
case natural language and graphics, in a multi-modal informa-
tion system. The choice of an appropriate combination of
modes is essential for a successful interface design. As there is
not yet a complete theory of multi-modal interaction, this ques-
tion has to be answered experimentally. Therefore, we propose
a modular architecture for multi-modal interfaces composed
of interaction tools. In this paper, we discuss the addition of
natural language generation to the interaction tools provided.
This capability is embodied in the prototype IGiNG (Integrat-
ing araphics and Natural Language aeneration) which com-
bines
• the graphical information system SIC! (System for In-
formation on Conferences) comprising a dialog man-
ager which is able to track the user&apos;s goals and, conse-
quently, to plan system reactions as cooperative
responses (Tissen, 1991), a database access module
providing relevant data (Cracker, 1991) and a presen-
tation manager generating visualizations of the re-
trieved information items (Kerner and Thiel, 1991).

presentation form that can show unlimited amounts of in-
formation, e.g. the table presentation form (cf. Figure 2). If he

is interested more in the structure of the data, he might change
his initial query so that less data are retrieved. But, importantly,
the user cannot be aware of the details of the current situation
of retrieval and its implications simply from the graphical in-
formation displayed. Hence the system has to inform him of
the situation and offer possible alternatives. This needs to be
done in a way that enables users to grasp the situation and to
choose the appropriate alternatives for their purpose. To
achieve this, the system has to create a coherent informative
act that is concise and yet unambiguous (in context), giving all
the information necessary for the user to determine his future
actions.
Based on work by Feiner and McKeown (1990) on the
coordination of text and graphics in explanation generation
and by Lombardi (1989), who examined the assignment of in-
formation to media, we assume that text is the appropriate me-
dium for informative acts in meta-dialogs, since a well-
constructed text is not only concise and easy to understand, but
also guarantees the necessary flexibility to meet any situation
that arises. Graphical &apos;acts&apos; cannot be constructed composi-
tionally to express possibly unforeseen complex circum-
stances: novel graphics must first be learnt by users — a situa-
tion avoided by the generation of situationally appropriate
natural language. Thus, generating natural language text, par-
ticularly text involving controlled and appropriate deployment
of text-forming resources such as rhetorical relations, en-
hances the total coherence of the user&apos;s dialog with the system.
Our hypothesis is that the user&apos;s understanding of the situation
and its implications is increased by the natural language out-
put, which becomes an intermediary between the various pos-
sibilities for information presentation.

4 KOMET/Penman Text Generation System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96605484">
We are using the KOMET/Penman&apos; system (Mann and Mat-
thiessen, 1983) for generating the natural language output our
system requires. KOMET/Penman is a domain-independent
text generation system based on systemic-functional grammar
(Halliday, 1978). It consists of extensive grammars of English
and German (Matthiessen, 1990; Teich, 1991), a linguistically
motivated ontology, called the Upper Model (Bateman, Kasp-
er, Moore and Whitney, 1989), a semantic interface that relates
the categories of the conceptual ontology with their possible
grammatical expressions in English and German (Matthies-
sen, 1990), and a basic lexicon containing English and German
closed-class items and default lexical realizations for the con-
cepts in the Upper Model ontology. The definition of the lexi-
cal items includes morphological information and sets of lexi-
cal features that determine the grammatical contexts in which
items are to be selected.
The Upper Model is the component of the system that is
primarily responsible for mediating between the knowledge
specific to any given domain and the general lexical and gram-
matical expressions that are provided by a language. Because it
is possible to state how any particular Upper Model concept is
to be realized, subordinating domain concepts to particular
Upper Model concepts causes those domain concepts to inherit
appropriate forms of expression. For example, concepts from
the object-class are usually realized as nominal phrases, while
concepts from the process-class (e.g., mental–process, verbal-
process, action-process, relation-process) are often realized by
clauses2. The relationship between Upper Model and domain
model is diagrammed in the context of its application for SIC!
in Figure 3.
Input to the KOMET/Penman text generation system is
given in terms of the Sentence Plan Language (Kasper, 1989),
of which we will see examples below. An SPL expression de-
fines the semantic content of a sentence to be generated; it con-
sists of a set of typed variables and relations defined between
those variables. Both the types and the possible relations are
defined either by the Upper Model directly or by concepts or
relations in the domain model that have been subordinated to
the Upper Model. In addition to this information, SPL expres-
sions may also contain direct statements in terms of the gram-
mar&apos;s semantic interface — in practical applications these
latter are often abbreviated by use of macros (e.g. :tense pres-
ent) or are defaulted.
1 The original Penman system was developed at the Information
Science Institute of the University of Southern California; the
KOMET system of GMD/IPSI builds on this, working towards
multilinguality and enhanced text planning capabilities.

motivates the maintenance of two distinct levels of representa-

5 Interfacing SIC! with the Text Generation
System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972261190476191">
To interface SIC! with KOMET/Penman we have to provide
several types of knowledge (cf. Figure 3)
• A domain model, which is a taxonomy of knowledge
specific to our application-domain. We split the do-
main into two parts: an Information-Domain (I-Do-
main), which contains concepts related to the informa-
tion that is shown by SIC!, e.g. workshops and topics
(cf. Figure 1), and a Presentation-Domain (P-Do-
main), which contains concepts related to the way this
information is presented by SIC!, e.g. ring, table. By
splitting the domain model we increase the adaptabil-
ity in case of changes in the underlying application do-
main, e.g. replacing the conference knowledge base
with a knowledge base on research projects. Every
concept in the domain model has to be linked to some
Upper Model concept from which it inherits attributes
which enable KOMET/Penman to express the concept
in a way that is grammatically correct. The I-Domain
concepts can be generated automatically from the un-
derlying SIC! knowledge bases (cf. Figure 3 ). Con-
cepts can also be associated to lexical items.

<bodyText confidence="0.999817714285714">
As stated in our example above, we want to produce text that,
in this case, informs the user that not all the information that
was requested can be shown because the current presentation-
form&apos;s capacity is limited. Furthermore, we need to offer pos-
sible actions which solve this problem. In Figure 4 , we show
the semantic input to KOMET/Penman, expressed in SPL, that
would cause KOMET/Penman to generate the first sentence

that we require: i.e., &amp;quot;The presentation-form&apos;s capacity is ex-
ceeded.&amp;quot; One type of abstract concept that the system requires
is the status of a particular entity that may be displayed or used.
Possible statuses are, for presentation-forms, exceeded, in-
complete. These status concepts can then be attributed to ob-
jects by means of the Upper Model relation ascription, which
has roles &apos;:domain&apos; and &apos;:range&apos;. They represent the concepts
which are related, in our example the presentation-form&apos;s ca-
pacity and exceeded. In general, &apos;:domain&apos; contains the essen-
tial concept of the relation while &apos;:range&apos; contains additional
information. The P-Domain concept capacity has been mod-
eled as an object.

6.2 Using Rhetorical Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791647058824">
Figure 5 shows a more complex SPL—plan which demon-
strates some of the more advanced possibilities given by KO-
MET/Penman. The most interesting aspect in this plan is the
use of rhetorical relations based on Rhetorical-Structure-
Theory (RST).
RST is a theory of the organization of natural language
texts (Mann and Thompson, 1987). Mann and Thompson stu-
died a wide variety of English texts and observed that there are
approximately 25 relations that usually occur between co-
herent portions of English text. An RST relation consists of
two parts, a nucleus and a satellite. The nucleus is that part that
is most essential to the speaker&apos;s purpose, while the satellite
contains additional information. The satellite is more easily re-
placed than the nucleus because of the nucleus&apos; central role in
the thematical progression of the discourse. Even though there
are some critics questioning the use of rhetorical relations in
discourse structure theory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) we use

RST relations because they proved to be quite useful when we
link portions of information. In KOMET/Penman, RST-rela-
tions are treated the same way as other relations, e.g. ascription
which we used in the plan shown in Figure 4.
The SPL-plan shown in Figure 5 combines two relations:
the ascription-relation, which we used in the SPL-plan in Fig-
ure 4 , and the existence-relation. Existence is a so called one-
place-relation, because it contains only a :domain-role but no
:range. It is usually realized as &amp;quot;There is ...&amp;quot; , where :domain
defines what exists. We link these two relations via an RST-
relation called rst-nonvolitional-result. This RST-relation im-
plies that the nucleus, which is defined in our :domain-role is a
result of the satellite, defined in :range. One possible output is
&lt;domain&gt;, because &lt;range&gt;, in our case &amp;quot;&lt;There are concepts
..&gt;, because &lt;... capacity is exceeded&gt;&amp;quot; . Because what is de-
fined in the :domain (&amp;quot;There are concepts that are not shown&amp;quot;)
is not volitional, we use rst-nonvolitional-result instead of rst-
volitional-result. The fact that there is data that is not shown by
the current presentation-form is essential to our informational
purpose. Therefore this fact becomes the nucleus (represented
by :domain) of our plan.

6.3 Supporting Coherence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988764705882">
In his work on coherence in multi-modal discourse, Bandyo-
padhyay (Bandyopadhyay, 1990) states that there are three
levels of coherence: syntactic coherence, semantic coherence
and pragmatic coherence. Syntactic coherence deals with the
immediate connectivity among adjacent segments (in texts
this is often called text cohesion). Semantic coherence ensures
the wellformed thematic organization of a discourse. Dis-
course segments are connected by semantic ties (Hobbs,
1983). Bandyopadhyay defines a discourse to bepragmatical-
ly coherent if it is compatible with the addressees&apos; interpreta-
tive ability. In our system syntactic coherence is enhanced by
the way we present the natural language output in our graphical
environment. Semantic coherence is supported by the use of
RST-relations which ensure the connectivity between our text
segments. Pragmatic coherence is supported by the mere fact
that we are using text as a medium for meta-dialogs, as these
are difficult to understand on a graphical level.

7 Controlling Multimodal Discourse
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998728125">
The dialog manager is one of the main components of our in-
terface system (cf. Figure 6). It chooses interaction modes
(graphic or text) and controls the navigation or exploration in
the information space.
In order to prevent the user from &apos;being lost in hyper-
space&apos;, we guide the user by case-based dialog plans (Tissen,
1991). In a case-based planning system a new plan will be gen-
erated by retrieving the plan which is most appropriate to the
user&apos;s goals and adapting it dynamically during the ongoing
dialog. Two types of adaptations can be distinguished: first,
system-driven modifications using domain dependent back-
ground knowledge, and second, corrections of misconcep-
tions, handled interactively in meta-dialogs with the user.
The dialog manager detects misconceptions, i.e. situa-
tions in which an intended goal cannot be realized, e.g. more
items were retrieved than can be displayed in the current pre-
sentation form. The corrector operates on knowledge bases of
misconceptions and correction rules, e.g. &amp;quot;if there is a miscon-
ception like &apos;ring presentation: not all requested data can be
presented in the ring&apos; and there is no automatic plan modifica-
tion possible then start a meta-dialog, which informs the user
about the situation and offers alternatives.&amp;quot; Because meta-
dialogs will be handled in text mode, the dialog manager re-
quests the SPL creator to produce SPL plans. Therefore, the
dialog manager informs the SPL creator on the current miscon-
ception and possible alternatives the user has to choose from to
resolve the situation. Then, the SPL creator produces the ap-
propriate SPL plans by combining information on the miscon-
ception and possible alternatives with elements from the SPL
library. The SPL plans are transformed into natural language
text by the KOMET/Penman system. The resulting text is re-
turned to the dialog manager which presents it to the user.

8 Controlling utterance selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931571428571">
The IGiNG system intends to produce user adapted natural
language output. It is an object oriented system consisting ol
several object classes (cf. Figure 7)
When IGiNG is requested to produce an utterance it calls the
utterance&apos;s express method, which first builds a list of plan-ob.
jects starting from the initial plan-object given by the utterance
object. Then, it is determined whether complex or short state
ments are desired. This information is kept in a user-stereotype
and determines in which direction the list of plan-objects is te
be traversed. Now IGiNG tests each plan-object&apos;s select condi
tions. If all conditions are satisfied, the plan-object is selected
otherwise IGiNG tries the succeeding plan-object. Finally tin
plan defined by the plan-object is passed to the KOMET/Pen
man system which generates the utterance.

<abstract confidence="0.986183727272727">In our current research into the design of cognitively well-motivated interfaces relying primarily on the display of graphical information, we have observed that graphical information alone does not provide sufficient support to users — particularly when situations arise that do not simply conform to the users&apos; expectations. This can occur due to too much information being requested, too little, information of the wrong kind, etc. To solve this problem, we are working towards the integraof natural language generation to augment the functionalities of the interface. This is intended to support the generation of flexible natural language utterances which pinpoint possible problems with a user&apos;s request and which further go on to outline the user&apos;s most sensible courses of action away from the problem. In this paper, we describe our first prototype, where we combine the graphical and interaction planning capabilities of our graphical information system SIC! with the text generation capabilities of the Penman system. We illustrate the need for such a combined system, and also give examples of how a general natural language facility beneficially augments the user&apos;s ability to navigate a knowledge base graphically.</abstract>

However, users often have difficulties in stating their information need precisely (cf. Brooks et al., 1986) and so a user interface design emphasizing multimedia aspects of information systems may be more appropriate. An object oriented presentation meets this requirement because users are allowed to investigate information items directly. Thus, the distance between the users&apos; intentions and the objects they involve is reduced to a minimum (cf. Hutchins et al., 1986). However, visual presentations of abstract information items have to be designed carefully to support the user in perceiving them correctly. Often the inherent limitations of available presentation forms, e.g. the number of displayable items, are an impediment to an adequate visualization. These difficulties which are well known in visual languages can be attacked by combining the presentation of graphical objects to the user with cooperative system responses in natural languages. Our approach to human-computer interaction provides the basis for an integration of different interaction styles,</context>

For example, concepts from the object-class are usually realized as nominal phrases, while concepts from the process-class (e.g., mental–process, verbalprocess, action-process, relation-process) are often realized by clauses2. The relationship between Upper Model and domain model is diagrammed in the context of its application for SIC! in Figure 3. Input to the KOMET/Penman text generation system is given in terms of the Sentence Plan Language (Kasper, 1989), of which we will see examples below. An SPL expression defines the semantic content of a sentence to be generated; it consists of a set of typed variables and relations defined between those variables. Both the types and the possible relations are defined either by the Upper Model directly or by concepts or relations in the domain model that have been subordinated to the Upper Model. In addition to this information, SPL expressions may also contain direct statements in terms of the grammar&apos;s semantic interface — in practical applications these latter are often abbreviated by use of macros (e</context>

Based on work by Feiner and McKeown (1990) on the coordination of text and graphics in explanation generation and by Lombardi (1989), who examined the assignment of information to media, we assume that text is the appropriate medium for informative acts in meta-dialogs, since a wellconstructed text is not only concise and easy to understand, but also guarantees the necessary flexibility to meet any situation that arises.

Our hypothesis is that the user&apos;s understanding of the situation and its implications is increased by the natural language output, which becomes an intermediary between the various possibilities for information presentation. 4 KOMET/Penman Text Generation System We are using the KOMET/Penman&apos; system (Mann and Matthiessen, 1983) for generating the natural language output our system requires. KOMET/Penman is a domain-independent text generation system based on systemic-functional grammar (Halliday, 1978). It consists of extensive grammars of English and German (Matthiessen, 1990; Teich, 1991), a linguistically motivated ontology, called the Upper Model (Bateman, Kasper, Moore and Whitney, 1989), a semantic interface that relates the categories of the conceptual ontology with their possible grammatical expressions in English and German (Matthiessen, 1990), and a basic lexicon containing English and German closed-class items and default lexical realizations for the concepts in the Upper Model ontology. The definition of the lexical items includes morphological information and sets of lexical features that determine the grammatical contexts in which items are to be selected. The Uppe</context>

Therefore, we propose a modular architecture for multi-modal interfaces composed of interaction tools. In this paper, we discuss the addition of natural language generation to the interaction tools provided. This capability is embodied in the prototype IGiNG (Integrating araphics and Natural Language aeneration) which combines • the graphical information system SIC! (System for Information on Conferences) comprising a dialog manager which is able to track the user&apos;s goals and, consequently, to plan system reactions as cooperative responses (Tissen, 1991), a database access module providing relevant data (Cracker, 1991) and a presentation manager generating visualizations of the retrieved information items (Kerner and Thiel, 1991). • the text generation component KOMET/Penman (Bateman et al., 1991; Penman, 1989), comprising extensive grammatical, semantic, and text organizational linguistic resources.

Pragmatic coherence is supported by the mere fact that we are using text as a medium for meta-dialogs, as these are difficult to understand on a graphical level. 7 Controlling Multimodal Discourse The dialog manager is one of the main components of our interface system (cf. Figure 6). It chooses interaction modes (graphic or text) and controls the navigation or exploration in the information space. In order to prevent the user from &apos;being lost in hyperspace&apos;, we guide the user by case-based dialog plans (Tissen, 1991). In a case-based planning system a new plan will be generated by retrieving the plan which is most appropriate to the user&apos;s goals and adapting it dynamically during the ongoing dialog. Two types of adaptations can be distinguished: first, system-driven modifications using domain dependent background knowledge, and second, corrections of misconceptions, handled interactively in meta-dialogs with the user. The dialog manager detects misconceptions, i.e. situations in which an intended goal cannot be realized, e.g. more items were retrieved than can be displayed in the current presentation form</context>
