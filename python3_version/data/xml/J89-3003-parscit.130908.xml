We introduce a new approach to representing and manipulating various types of non-singular concepts
in natural language discourse. The representation we describe is based on a partially ordered structure
of levels in which the objects of the same relative singularity are assigned to the same level. Our choice
of the representation has been motivated by the following main concerns: 1. The representation should
systematically distinguish between those language terms that are used to refer to objects of different
singularity, that is, those classified within different but related levels of the model; 2. The representation
should capture certain types of inter-sentential dependencies in discourse, most notably anaphoric-type
cohesive links; 3. Finally, the representation should serve as a basis for defining a formal semantics of
discourse paragraphs that would allow for capturing the exact truth conditions of sentences involving
non-singular terms, and for computing interlevel inferences. In this paper we discuss (1) and (2) only.
(3) is currently under investigation and will be the topic of a forthcoming article. We believe that our
approach promotes computational feasibility, because we avoid the identification of general terms, like
&amp;quot;temperature,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;water,&amp;quot; etc., with intensions, that is, functions over possible worlds. In our theory,
the concept of non-singularity has a local (often subjective) character.

1 INTRODUCTION

Treating non-singular concepts is a difficult representa-
tion problem in natural language research. Non-singular
concepts, as we shall understand them here, are often
abstract entities created to embrace a variety of smaller
or larger collections of &amp;quot;instances&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;specimen.&amp;quot;
They are usually referred to using bare plural noun
phrases (such as birds, alligators, presidents), or defi-
nite singular noun phrases with &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; interpreta-
tion (the alligator, the president). The literature de-
scribes numerous forms of non-singular concepts and
corresponding to them non-singular terms that can be
found in natural language discourse, including inten-
sional (or functional), mass, generic, habitual, abstract,
and more; see, for example, Montague (1974a), Lewis
(1976), Barwise and Perry (1983), Quine (1960), Donnel-
lan (1971), Vendler (1971), and Kripke (1972). In these
and other writings, various treatments for the phenom-
enon are suggested, but many of them do not properly
capture the distinction between singular and non-sin-
gular interpretation of linguistic descriptions. With the
exception of intensional concepts, other forms of non-
singularity have not been given satisfactory formal
representations that would account for their role in
natural language discourse. Perhaps the most successful
treatment of non-singular terms in language thus far has
been presented by Montague (1974a-d) with his formal-
ization of intension, which can be traced back to the
Fregean notion of sense. Unfortunately, the concept of
intension does not capture all aspects of non-singu-

larity, for example, bare plurals denoting kinds cannot
be adequately represented in Montague&apos;s intensional
logic (IL) without some superficial, and often unplausi-
ble, extensions (Carlson 1977, 1982). In addition, the
enormous complexity of any non-trivial system of pos-
sible worlds has proven to be disadvantageous for
developing a computationally oriented application of
Montague&apos;s theory (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).1
In this paper we do not attempt to improve on Mon-
tague&apos;s grammar; in fact, our approach does, in part,
rely on Montague&apos;s method of coupling the syntactic
and semantic processing in order to assign to a sentence
its meaning or at least a meaning-representing formula.
Nonetheless, we also perceive the limitations of Mon-
tague&apos;s method. It is not our intention here to build an
alternative formal system for a fragment of English that
would replace that of Montague&apos;s. Instead, we propose
a computationally oriented approach to certain prob-
lems with which Montague dealt only marginally or not
at all. However informal our presentation may be, we
make some effort to put things into a clear, semiformal
setting. As various aspects of out theory crystalize, we
expect a more formal version to emerge.
We introduce a fragment of a new and, we believe,
computationally feasible theory of names and descrip-
tions, which offers a uniform treatment for many types
of non-singular concepts found in natural language
discourse. Although we limit our presentation to nomi-
nal phrase constructions, the approach can be further
extended to cover other types of phrases. We present
the formal definition of non-singularity with respect to a
particular discourse situation involving a discourse mes-
sage; a number of individuals (parties); and their knowl-
edge, beliefs, awareness, etc. We introduce a layered
model of reality (the universe) as perceived by a dis-
course participant, and define relative singularity of
objects in this universe as an abstraction class of the
layer-membership relation. Subsequently, linguistic de-
scriptions and names are classified as singular, measur-
ably singular, or non-singular depending upon what they
are assumed to denote in the universe. The relationship
between objects referred to in discourse and classified
into different layers (levels) of the universe model has a
particular significance for resolution of certain types of
cohesive links in text. We call these links remote
references because they cross level boundaries. In order
to adequately explain the phenomenon of a remote
reference, we propose a fairly general theory of names
and descriptions in discourse. Although the theory lacks
a complete formal specification at this time, we intro-
duce a number of notions, such as a superobject and a
coordinate, that, we believe, will prove helpful in further
formalization of various intuitions presented here.
In its present form, our theory focuses entirely on the
problems of non-singularity and remote references in
discourse that are created by the use of definite descrip-
tions, bare plurals, and proper names. We do not
describe in detail how one could actually compute
remote references in discourse, except for two general
rules introduced in Section 6. These rules, and perhaps
some others yet to be developed, create a natural
expansion of the system for computing intersentential
anaphoric references described in Strzalkowski and
Cercone (1986). Except for a brief overview in Section
2, we do not discuss many related phenomena, such as
non-remote (or single level) references, opaque read-
ings, non-referential interpretations, use of personal
pronouns, and the like. The more general theory of
stratified meaning representation (Strzalkowski 1986)
addresses all of these concerns, as well as the problems
of discourse coherence, selecting proper cohesive links
in discourse, and building a discourse model.

2 COMPUTING INTERSENTENTIAL DEPENDENCIES IN
DISCOURSE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999552153846154">
A first step toward automating the process of discourse
understanding is to grasp the meaning contents of the
discourse message, at least the literal meaning. A dis-
course normally consists of more than a single utter-
ance, and although every utterance may be assumed to
contribute something to the discourse meaning as a
whole, this latter can only rarely be regarded as a simple
sum of meanings of component utterances. Utterances,
or sentences, making up a discourse are usually in-
volved in complicated mutual dependencies, that often
go beyond the text itself. A careful study of these
extrasentential and intersentential dependencies in dis-
course is necessary before a more successful attempt to
design an automated discourse understanding system
can be undertaken.
In Strzalkowski (1986) and Strzalkowski and Cer-
cone (1986) we introduced a rigorous method for han-
dling certain cases of extrasentential dependencies in
discourse, within a general framework, which we call
the Stratified Model. The Stratified Model comprises a
collection of disambiguating transformations that are
applied to a discourse fragment before it can be assigned
a final representation. These transformations include
morphological analysis, lexical disambiguation, syntac-
tic parsing, computing extrasentential dependencies,
and pragmatic evaluation in discourse context. In order
to compute anaphoric, and other, dependencies be-
tween sentences in a discourse fragment, we first trans-
late each sentence in the fragment into an intermediate,
formal representation language. We call these transla-
tions literal or &amp;quot;context-less&amp;quot; because they are derived
based solely on sentences&apos; syntactic structure. In fact,
this transformation is done Montague-style (Montague
1974d) except for the intermediate representation,
which, in the Stratified Model, is a A-categorial language
A, rather than an intensional logic. For this presentation
it is enough to say that A is a typed predicate-calculus
language with A-operator. A formal definition of A is
given in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986). Next, we

proceed to compute various contextual dependencies of
sentences, including extrasentential anaphoric links.
Let L be a language of parse structures obtained in
some grammar of a fragment of English. For the pur-
pose of this presentation, L is identified with the set of
phrase markers that can be generated from English
sentences with a categorial grammar CAT similar to that
of Montague (1974). Although some other syntactic
system may be more suitable in practical application,
we select CAT here for its relative simplicity and
elegance. We concentrate on the translation of some
example expressions, sentences, and paragraphs of L
into a representation in a A-categorial language A that
would capture both a sentence&apos;s logical form and its
cohesive links to the surrounding discourse. In partic-
ular, we shall look closely at the cohesive links created
by inter-sentential anaphoric references appearing in
different contextual situations.
A possesses adequate expressive power to represent
the meaning of a considerable spectrum of linguistic
constructs found in a natural language discourse. What
is of a particular interest to us, A provides a natural and
uniform means for computing and representing extra-
sentential dependencies. As we shall see in the next
section, a meaning representation language so-defined
is still inadequate for capturing some more difficult
cases, which we call remote co-references.
Our present effort is to describe a transformation ISD
such that ISD C L x A, and whenever a source
expression in L consists of more than one sentence, a
class of intersentential dependencies within this frag-
ment is identified and resolved, if possible. It must be
noted here that ISD represents a semantic process that
is entirely independent . of any pragmatic or domain
related factors. As a result a substantial amount of
domain oriented ambiguity may be left unresolved. In
any practical application, this transformation must be
accompanied by a pragmatic process, as described in
Strzalkowski (1986). ISD consists of a collection of
translation rules {R1, R2, . . .}, such that each rule is
responsible for translating a specific type of depen-
dency. Actually, only Rule 1 works directly on expres-
sions of L, translating them into literal representations
in A, independent of one another. Rules numbered 2 and
up will take these literal translations and try to relate
them pairwise looking, among other things, for unre-
solved anaphoric references. Most of these rules can be
written in terms of two distinguished expressions of A,
Si and S2, which we call the context-setting sentence and
the current sentence, respectively. Expression S1 is a
A-representation of the linguistic context in which the
sentence with translation S2 is to be evaluated. Neither
Si nor S2 must correspond to surface sentences, though.
Si may represent a larger part of discourse, perhaps an
entire paragraph; on the other hand, S2 may constitute
only a subclause of Si in which case we would talk of
intra-sentential dependency. It should be noted here
that the potentially explosive number of possibilities
will be in fact limited by the actual structure of the
discourse under consideration (see, among others,
Grosz and Sidner 1985), as well as by the pragmatic and
domain related information, not discussed here.
Let us now consider a two sentence paragraph given
below:
SI: John interviewed a candidate.
S2: The guy had impressive references.
In the most natural reading of this paragraph, the
anaphor of &amp;quot;the guy&amp;quot; is resolved against &amp;quot;a candidate&amp;quot;
in the first sentence, so that the second sentence
actually means: &amp;quot;the guy whom John interviewed had
impressive references.&amp;quot; When considered separately
from one another, S1 and S2 obtain the following trans-
lations into A.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999940666666667">
S —&gt; 3 x[cand(x) &amp; int(J ,x)]
S2 3x[guy(x) &amp; C(x) &amp; Vy[(guy(y) &amp; C(y)) D
(x = y)] &amp; had-imp-ref(x)]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975333333333">
In the translation of S2, C is a free predicate variable
that needs to be bound by the sentence&apos;s context. The
context variable is introduced into the translation of a
definite noun phrase containing a definite article, such
as &amp;quot;the,&amp;quot; by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski 1986, Strzalkowski
and Cercone 1986). This rule generates literal transla-
tions of sentences without considering their context,
and does so in PTQ-style, that is, by assigning to each
syntactic operation in CAT a formula formatting oper-
ation in A (Montague 1974a). The next step is to resolve
context references; we must find a binding for C occur-
ring in S2 in the context provided by SI in order to
obtain the final translation of the former. This intersen-
tential dependency is captured by the translation Rule 2,
which operates on the literal translations of both sen-
tences delivered by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski and Cercone
1986). In the example above, the second sentence
obtains the desired translation as shown below.

Rule 2 (Perfect-Context Translation Rule):

<bodyText confidence="0.477613">
If the context-setting sentence S1 has a referential

A somewhat different problem arises when we consider
a fragment with a possible non-referential interpreta-
tion, as in
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 173
Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse
John wants to marry a princess. The girl must be rich
and pretty.
Now, Rule 2 can compute the anaphoric link between
&amp;quot;the girl&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a princess&amp;quot; only if both sentences
receive their referential interpretations. In a case where
both sentences are understood non-referentially, we
have to use Rule 3, given below. No other combinations
are possible.
Rule 3 (Imperfect-Context Translation Rule):
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.882991833333333">
If the context-setting sentence S1 has a non-referen-
tial interpretation in the form
imp (3u [P(u) &amp; F(u)]),
where imp is an imperfect operator, and the current
sentence S2, also in a non-referential interpretation,
contains a definite anaphor which occurs in scope of
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.541908">
an imperfect operator imp i i.e.,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998628">
S2 = impi (3u [C(u) &amp; P1(u) &amp; F1(u) &amp;
V x 1 (x) &amp; C(x)} 3 (x= u)]],
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.617076">
then this anaphor can be resolved against SI, with
the resulting translation of S2 derived as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.96757">
AC[S2](Au[P(u) &amp; F(u)]).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999078846153846">
Rule 3 encompasses a large class of non-referential
contexts, which we call imperfect contexts, and which
involve constructs including propositional attitudes
(want, try, wish), intensional verbs (seek, conceive,
think about), other complement-taking verbs (go,
come), modal verbs (must, can, will), as well as pro-
gressive tense forms. In Rule 3, all this is reduced to the
formula with the imp operator which translates com-
pound phrases, such as &amp;quot;John wants,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;John will.&amp;quot;
Thus, in the example given above, Rule 3 is applicable
when both sentences contain a wide scope imp opera-
tor. In this case, the second sentence of the fragment
obtains the full translation with the following formula:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994749666666667">
must(3x [girl(x) &amp; princess(x) &amp; marries(J,x) &amp;

marries(J,y)} 3 (x=y)]])
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995650375">
Other studied cases of intersentential anaphora (see
Strzalkowski 1986a-c, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986)
include non-referential interpretation of discourse frag-
ments involving attitude report verbs (believe, know,
disagree). These cannot be translated with Rule 3, and a
new rule, Rule 4, is developed to compute anaphoric
links in texts similar to the one given below.
John believes that a unicorn lives in the park.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989626">
• He thinks the creature has a long horn.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.965990444444444">
Rules 5, 6, and 7 account for the pronominal anaphora,
Rule 10 deals with certain instances of attributive use of
definite noun phrases. Rules 8 and 9 are used when the
antecedent of an anaphor is a proper name rather than a
description. This is the situation where an interesting
type of referential ambiguity occurs whose resolution
may have far reaching consequences on the process of
discourse understanding.
Rule 9 (Names as Ultimate Referents):
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.799918777777778">
If the context-setting sentence S1 has the form of
F1(N) where N is an individual constant denoting a
name, and the current sentence S2 containsa definite
anaphor, so that its literal translation has the form
S 2 = 3x [P(x) &amp; C(x) &amp; F2 (X) &amp; Vy [{P(y) &amp;
C(y)1 3 (x=y)]],
then the anaphor can be resolved against N as its
ultimate referent with the following derivation:

In the following fragment,
Sylvester tries to catch a bird. The cat is clumsy.
there are two possible ways of linking &amp;quot;the cat&amp;quot; with
&amp;quot;Sylvester.&amp;quot; In one reading, not very different from
those processed with Rule 2, the definite anaphor refers
primarily to the entity that can be described as &amp;quot;the one
who tries to catch a bird,&amp;quot; and only contingently to its
name. In this case we acquire some new information
about Sylvester, namely that it is a cat. In the other
possible reading, the anaphor refers to the name only,
and thus may draw on some context that is different
from the first sentence in the fragment. This latter
situation is handled by Rule 9. In the above fragment,
Rule 9 would produce the following translation for &amp;quot;the
cat is clumsy&amp;quot; (S is an individual constant denoting the
individual named Sylvester, and Syl(x) means that x&apos;s
name is Sylvester):

There are more aspects of ISD transformation that merit
attention. These include rules for dealing with other
kinds of anaphora not discussed here, elliptical con-
structions, enumerably singular (plural) terms, intrasen-
tential anaphora, and non-anaphoric dependencies, as
well as indirect and forward reference cases where
access to the speaker/hearer knowledge base may be
required. We also have to deal with the changing
reference level.

The rules discussed in Section 2 cover selected cases of
intersentential anaphora where the reference level in
discourse does not change from one sentence to an-
other. There exists, however, a class of intersentential
dependencies whereby a reference is made across
boundaries of different reference levels in discourse.
For example, in

live in our climate.

&amp;quot;the alligator&amp;quot; in the second sentence most likely refers
to a generic object of which the alligator in the first
sentence is an instance or extension. Thus we can say
that the second alligator is a non-singular superobject in
which the first alligator somehow participates. The
extent of such participation is not clear, but in general it
can be observed that certain predications true of com-
plexes of different kind are not preserved for their parts
or elements, and vice versa. To represent this new kind
of intersentential dependency we introduce a multilevel
model for interpreting natural language expressions,
such that the levels in the model would correspond
(roughly) to the levels of reference in discourse. For
instance, in the example above, the resulting represen-
tation would have both alligators placed at different,
though related, &amp;quot;object levels.&amp;quot; Because of an inherent
subjectivity of such classifications, the levels in the
model may have fuzzy boundaries and are only partially
ordered with the &amp;quot;lower than&amp;quot; (i.e., &amp;quot;more detailed
than&amp;quot;) relation with respect to some current level
(corresponding to the level of reference at a present
point in discourse).
Consider now a somewhat larger fragment of text,
excerpted from an article appearing in The New Yorker
magazine.
The two Ashanti kings are in somewhat different
situations: the Ghanaian king is royally born, richly
rewarded, divinely inspired and holds his office for
life. The American Ashanti king is elected every two
years from the ranks of an Ashanti social and cultural
organization called the Asanteman Association of the
United States of America, Inc. The first Stateside
king, Kwadwo Tuffuor, was a plumber. The second,
Kusi Appouh, repaired air-conditioners and refriger-
ators. Kwabena Oppong is the third king; he drives a
cab.2
The first two sentences in this fragment contain direct
references to the higher-level entities, which are the two
Ashanti kings, as if they were ordinary singular objects.
The remaining three sentences directly refer to the
entities that are instances of one of these kings, now
seen as superobjects, at different time intervals. The
discourse reference level has changed, and now we talk
about lower-level entities. The superobjects can still be
referred to, but only indirectly, through their instances;
this is what we call the remote reference.
The primitive notions of our theory are these of a
singular object and a coordinate, a usually ordered set
specifying a type of dimension that the object in ques-
tion spans. A singular object is any entity to which we
can directly refer using a nominal phrase of our lan-
guage. The most common of the coordinates are time
and space but other more abstract ones are also possi-
ble. These two basic notions are then used to define the
notion of the object&apos;s instance with respect to some
coordinate. Thus the pet alligator in the example above
is related to the generic concept of alligator by some
species coordinate that somehow ties (or enumerates?)
all alligators around the world. Similarly, if we use an
appropriate coordinate consisting of two-year intervals
we can decompose the American Ashanti king into its
elected instances. If we reverse this process we can
combine objects into complexes to which we can sub-
sequently refer using collective terms, singular or plu-
ral, such as, for example, &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot;
(generic). The lower than relation between levels in the
universe model derives from expanding the notion of
instance over collections of objects. The relation intro-
duces a partial ordering within the universe model and
thus helps to trace changes in the reference level of
discourse. The highly discrete approach taken here is
favorably contrasted with other existing approaches to
non-singular terms, including Quine (1960), Kripke
(1972), Montague (1974), Carlson (1982), and others.
While insights of Quine, Kripke and, perhaps even more
so, Carlson are undoubtedly of great influence, they
require reworking in more discrete terms. Finally, we
may note that the research in artificial intelligence and
computational linguistics has devoted relatively little
attention to treatment of non-singular terms in natural
language in general and in natural language discourse in
particular; see, however, Sidner (1979) for some early
attempts to recognize generics in discourse. One of the
goals of the present research is to fill this gap.

Hundreds of similar examples involving such non-sin-
gular terms, and corresponding non-singular objects, as
water, heat, the Pope, the number, etc. can be devised.
Unfortunately, there is no generally accepted account
of these non-singular terms in the philosophical litera-
ture. Some authors, for example, Vendler (1971) and
Barwise and Perry (1983), cautiously called them ge-
neric, or general (for example, &amp;quot;the king&amp;quot;), or func-
tional (such as &amp;quot;the number of students,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the temper-
ature&amp;quot;) uses of definite descriptions. Other authors, for
example, Kripke (1972), were quite close to considering
these kinds of non-singular terms as names (or at least
some of them: heat, gold). Still other authors writing on
the subject, for example, Quine (1960, 1973), advocated
the notion of abstract terms as comprising of attributes,
such as (being) red (further abstracted as &amp;quot;redness&amp;quot;), or

Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse
(being) the man drinking the martini (which cannot be
so easily nominalized), which can be predicated of
&amp;quot;concrete&amp;quot; objects. If we consider this discussion, the
so-called &amp;quot;attributive use&amp;quot; of singular definite descrip-
tions as identified by Donnellan (1971), may be consid-
ered as addressing some abstract, higher-level, and
therefore (in our interpretation) non-singular concepts.
Carlson (1982) discusses the case of so-called &amp;quot;natural
kinds,&amp;quot; a specific type among generic terms. He advo-
cates the view in which generic terms are taken as
denoting entities in the same way that singular terms do.
If we accept Carlson&apos;s position, then our ontology of
objects becomes far richer than before, and we need to
impose more structure on our representation to reflect
this new situation accurately. Indeed, Carlson intro-
duces a special R relation into Montague&apos;s IL which
allows him to create individual objects out of generic
objects, as well as stages out of ordinary singular
objects. Thus, &amp;quot;Max believes that dogs are here&amp;quot;
receives the following translation, where m and d are
individual constants denoting Max and dog kind, re-
spectively (Carlson 1977):

Ax[Bel(^3y[R(y, x) &amp; here&apos;(y)lim)lid)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986412">
This formula says that Max believes that some stages of
dog-kind are here. One problem with this representation
is that we have no idea how these stages are to be
identified, in other words, how do we decompose a
kind-level object into stage-level individuals. If other
types of non-singular terms denote in similar fashion,
then we may need an even more complex model in
which various stages (or levels) of object aggregation
can be reflected.
Quine (1960) presents the most comprehensive ac-
count of various categories of terms found among
natural language expressions. Almost everything that
one can say is made up of different kinds of terms,
appropriately connected to yield meaningful utterances,
which he classifies as singular, general, relative, ab-
stract, attributive, etc. At present, we do not draw such
fine distinctions in our classification, reserving the right
to develop extensions along the lines of Quine as
needed. We present a few examples to provide addi-
tional insight and lay the foundation for our theory of
names and descriptions.
There are numerous linguistic puzzles involving non-
singular definite descriptions, among them Partee&apos;s
(1972) famous temperature problem. Example 2 illus-
trates this phenomenon.

2a. The temperature is rising.
The temperature is ninety.
Thus, Ninety is rising.3
2b. The president is elected every four years.
The president is Reagan.
Thus, Reagan is elected every four years.
2c. The tiger lives in the jungle.
My pet is a tiger.
Thus, My pet lives in the jungle.
2d. Americans drive big cars.
John is an American.
Thus, John drives big cars/a big car.
The arguments in (2a-d) are normally considered in-
valid. Various researchers agree that the definite de-
scriptions &amp;quot;the temperature,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the president,&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;the tiger&amp;quot; in the first sentences of (2a-c) should be
interpreted functionally, that is, as intensions (Mon-
tague 1974d), or functions over situations (Barwise and
Perry 1983). Note that if the descriptions were to be
interpreted singularly or as enumerating all instances of
a non-singular object (that is, statements containing
them were understood as making claims about each
instance), the reasoning would be valid. In (2d) the
situation is somewhat more complicated, because every
extension of the entity in the denotation of Americans is
itself a compound entity, namely a generic entity. Thus,
intensionality alone cannot explain why the first two
sentences in (2d) appear connected. As a matter of fact,
the reasoning displayed in (2d) is far more acceptable
that those in (2a) to (2c). The reason, it seems, lies in
our reluctance to apply singular interpretations to non-
singular terms in first sentences of (2a-c), while this
same move is more likely in (2d). In other words, while
(2b&apos;) is an unlikely interpretation of (2b), (2d&apos;) can
occasionally be accepted as a simplified version of (2d).
2b&apos;. Every president is elected every four years.
Reagan is the president.
Thus, Reagan is elected every four years.
2d&apos;. Every American drives big cars/a big car.
John is an American.
Thus, John drives big cars/a big car.
Of course, (2a) and (2b), but not (2c) or (2d), could be
valid if the definite noun phrases in the second sen-
tences (the temperature, the president) were understood
as co-referential with appropriate noun phrases in the
first sentences. This avenue is also closed, however,
because we do not regard these phrases as co-referen-
tial, that is, they cannot be substituted for one another,
nor can be their denotations. Compare this with (2e)
below, where the co-reference between &amp;quot;carnivorous
animals&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;these beasts&amp;quot; is easily made.
2e. Carnivorous animals live in these forests.
These beasts are tigers.
Thus, tigers live in these forests.
We claim here that no two descriptions can be consid-
ered co-referential unless they are used to refer to the
objects that are at the comparable stages of aggregation.
We call such object relatively singular and place them
within the same level in our model. It is clear that the
objects referred to by the corresponding descriptions in
the first two sentences of (2a) to (2d) are not relatively
singular, and thus the conclusions in the third sentences
are not forthcoming. Another type of co-reference,
which we call a remote co-reference, can still occur, and
we put this view forward in this paper.

5 A MULTILEVEL MODEL FOR INTERPRETING NATURAL
LANGUAGE TERMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999589023255815">
Initially, we note that our language tends to deal with
singular objects only, no matter how complex their
structure happens to be. A singular object is any entity
that can be taken as a coherent whole, in other words,
it can be referred to directly using a referring expression
of language: a name, a definite description, a pronoun.
Thus, at least as far as our ability to refer is concerned,
all objects appear singular. Still, it is not the case that all
objects are singular in the same way. Take, for example,
two persons John and Mary. They are singular objects
and they seem singular in the same way, in other words,
singular relative to one another. Next take alligator, the
species, and the alligator John owns. Although both are
singular in their own right, they are not compatible
when related to one another: the alligator John owns
appears only a manifestation, or extension, of alligator
the species at a certain space-time location. The indi-
vidual alligator, which at some period of its life is owned
by John is, therefore, singular in the same way John is,
but this will not be the case when we consider the time
slice of this alligator (an alligator stage, in Carlson&apos;s
words) while it was owned by John. This latter appears
only an instance of the individual alligator at some time
interval. By the same token, if John owns many differ-
ent alligators at different times (but, arguably, never
more than one at a time) then we may risk to refer to
John&apos;s alligator, an abstract object that generalizes over
all alligator stages of all individual alligators ever owned
by John (for example, &amp;quot;John always walks his alligator
in the morning&amp;quot;). The new object, again, seems to
belong in the same class of objects as John and Mary.
Let us introduce, only intuitively at first, the relation
Of relative singularity among objects. As suggested
above, this relation will help us to break down the
universe of objects into classes of relatively singular
objects, which we call levels. The levels can be subse-
quently partially ordered with lower than relation, i.e.,
L1 &lt; L2, indicating that level L1 consists of manifesta-
tions (extensions, instances) of objects at level L2. Let
Lo be an arbitrary level we select as our reference point;
if our discourse operates at this level then Lo defines the
current level of reference of the discourse. Let L+1 and
L_1 be two other levels different than Lo and such that
L_1 &lt;L0 &lt; L+1. At level L+1 we place the objects we
consider to be generalizations (or abstractions) of some
measurable amount of objects from Lo. It is only from
the perspective of L+1 that we are able interpret &amp;quot;The
tiger lives in the jungle,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The president is elected
every four years,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Birds can fly,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Tourists
start forest fires.&amp;quot; The objects at L+1 are singular but
only when related to one another within the same level;
when viewed from Lo they appear generic or functional
or the like, in other words, non-singular. When we
attempt to find a denotation for a nominal, such as &amp;quot;the
tiger&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tourists,&amp;quot; within Lo, we attempt to give it
either a singular or measurably singular interpretation.
In a singular interpretation (if possible at all), we have a
nominal refer to a specific object within the level
(John&apos;s pet tiger), while in a measurably singular inter-
pretation we use a quantification over a finite set of
singular objects, also within the same level (every tiger,
some tourists). Nominals denoting objects which are
non-singular with respect to Lo, on the other hand, may
have neither singular nor measurably singular interpre-
tations within this level. In order to find proper deno-
tations for them we must change the reference level
from Lo to L+1. Thus, while the statement of &amp;quot;The
President lives in the White House&amp;quot; when interpreted at
level L+1 can be argued to be equivalent to the state-
ment &amp;quot;Every president lives in the White House&amp;quot;
interpreted at Lo, the same cannot be said of &amp;quot;The tiger
lives in the jungle&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Every tiger lives in the
jungle.&amp;quot; We must note that some objects found at L+1
could have been placed there by design rather than as a
result of generalizing from Lo; an example of such
higher-level object may be The President.
If level L+1 contains generalizations of objects from
Lo, then level L_1 will contain their specializations or
extensions. Descending upon L_1 we can see that what
we previously considered to be the atom actually de-
notes many different kinds of atoms (H, 0, Ca, Fe,
etc.), or that the mail is not the same every morning, or
that Nicolas Bourbaki is the name of a group of
mathematicians.4
A few definitions will help to put the above intuitions
into a more formal setting.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.662460111111111">
Def. 1. A use of a description is called singular if it
refers to a singular object. A use of a description will
be called measurably singular if it refers to some
measurable quantity of a singular object. Otherwise
we shall talk of non-singular use.
Def. 2. An object level, or simply a level, is an
arbitrary collection of relatively singular objects. On
the language side, the corresponding reference level
encompasses those singular and measurably singu-
lar uses of descriptions that refer to the level&apos;s
objects.
Def. 3. For any level L, there are at least two distinct
levels L_1 and L+1 such that L+1 contains these
objects which are non-singular from the perspective
of L, and L_1 contains the objects for which the
objects at L are non-singular.
Def. 4. The level Lo is an arbitrarily chosen level
serving as a reference point.

As described, the structure of levels is not yet adequate
to capture the full complexity of the reference structure
of discourse. A notion of coordinate has to be intro-
duced along the following lines. We shall call T a
coordinate, if T is a set of points or locations at which
certain general (or abstract) objects, for example the
president or the atom, are assigned more specific exten-
sions or instances, such as President Reagan or H, Fe,
Ca, . . . . A coordinate is usually an ordered set though
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 177
Tomek Strzalkowsld and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse
the ordering may be partial only. Almost any object we
can think of appears an instance of a more general
concept, and often there will be more such concepts
available, if we consider different coordinates. Water in
a glass is an instance of some totality of water in the
universe (space&apos; coordinate), and also an instance of a
concept of water as in &amp;quot;Water boils at 100 degrees
Celsius.&amp;quot; These examples suggest that a coordinate is
usually a large set, often an infinite set, though perhaps
no more than recursively enumerable. A non-singular
object can be decomposed into instances in more than
one way, depending which coordinate is used. An
important observation is that when a higher-level object
is decomposed with two different coordinates the result-
ing sets of instances need not belong to the same level.
The concept of the American president in the twentieth
century is an instance of The President, but is still
non-singular when compared with President Reagan,
also an instance of The President, though with respect
to a different coordinate. A somewhat finer structure of
levels is required.
Let LN&apos;T be the level where we place the instances of
object N decomposed with coordinate T. By analogy,
we define LN,f to be the level such that for any object
M, M E L417. if N E LT. In other words, LW&apos; contains
the superobject M generalizing over object N with the
use of coordinate T. Suppose that we have an object N
at level Lo, to which we refer using a description N.5
Suppose further that coordinate T is selected so that for
any x, y E T we have that N-at-x # N-at-y. Let us use N„
to stand for N-at-x, where x is an element of T, and let
(N x) be an expression (as translated into our meaning
representation language) that refers to the object N„,
whenever the expression N refers to N. We obtain
therefore that
Fl. Vx,y E T [x # y 3 (N x) # (Ny)]
The new objects Nx&apos;s cannot be placed at Lo because,
being instances of N, they are not singular relative to N
(see Def. 2). Instead, we move them onto a new level
LN_&apos;17. leaving the original object N at Lo. We say that the
level LN&apos;T is lower than the level Lo, and write LN,IT &lt;
Lo. Often we drop the superscripts N and T over the
level symbol, assuming some lower level L_1, whenever
it does not lead to ambiguity. Example 3 helps to
illustrate the phenomenon just discussed.
Example 3. Let us consider a rather naive concept of
bird, as that of a winged creature that lay eggs and can
fly. Let B be extension of this concept in our model and
let Lo be set so that B E Lo. Using a genus coordinate,
G, we can construct a level LB2P containing such objects
as eagle, hawk, and goose. Let&apos;s suppose that, initially,
penguin can also be found at level Lf. Upon discovery
that penguins cannot fly, however, one would wish to
relax the characteristics of the concept B from Lo to
contain both flying and non-flying birds. Nonetheless,
two distinct concepts emerge, that of flying birds and
that Of non-flying birds, both of which become subordi-
nates of the (now) more general concept B. These new
concepts are placed at a new level LB2F, where K={ki,
k2} is a class coordinate such that Bki is the concept of
flying bird, FB, and B k2 is the concept of non-flying bird,
NFB. The old level LBV remains intact, though it is
different from Moreover, ev &lt; LB,ic because
LwiGB&apos; C LB,p, where B&apos; is either FB or NFB, and
GB,CG. There is another way of interpreting concept B
as well: we introduce a specimen coordinate S that
allows us to pick up specific birds, such as Opus, the
penguin, at level LB215. Note that this level is lower than
ev because it contains all levels L75-&amp;quot;, where X ranges
over objects at LB2p , and SxCS. Note that the structure
of levels has been created as described because of the
following set of conditions.

Now we can attempt to represent meanings of some
simple statements about birds. For example, Birds can
fly is represented at Lo as can-fly(B), while Opus is a
bird would translate as 3sES [(B s) = Opus]. We cannot
infer from these statements that Opus can fly because
this would require the formula Vs [can-fly((B s))] to be
true, which does not have to be the case considering
that B may now contain instances of non-flying birds.
Indeed, Opus cannot fly, which translates to
—Ican-fly(Opus), is not necessarily inconsistent with the
above two.7 The only thing we could say about each

instance of B is, perhaps, that it is a bird and that every
bird is an instance of B. In other words, if x is a LB_15
variable then Vx [bird(x) asES[x=(B s)]] is true. This
would lead to an equivalent L_1 translation of Opus is a
bird as bird(Opus). Later, we will see that this equiva-
lence is not generally valid.
Let us now resume our general discussion on the
characteristics of the structure of levels. At level L_1,
we have an enumerable collection of different objects
Nx&apos;s. Extending the description used for N (at Lo) over
Nx&apos;s we refer to them as the N, a N, some N(s), every
N, etc. It is possible, of course, that some other object
N&apos; found at Lo is now disclosed to be Nx, for some x E
T. What that means is that we have placed N&apos; incor-
rectly at Lo, because it actually belonged to L_1. Con-
sider the case of an ancient astronomer who believed
that the Morning Star and the Evening Star were not
only two different heavenly bodies, but also of the same
genre as other stars. In our conventions, both the
Morning Star and the Evening Star were placed at the
level to which the planet Venus now belongs. When
correcting this ancient misconception, we faced the
problem of an instance of some object and the object
itself were mistakenly assigned the same singularity
level; that is, we had both Nx and N at Lo. Nevertheless,
this situation represented the state of our knowledge of
the world at the time.
We may now give names to some Nx&apos;s and N may
very well happen to be among them. This time, how-
ever, N will not denote the old object from Lo; this will
be quite a different name referring the selected Nx and
can be replaced by a definite description (N x). To
illustrate this phenomenon, we may compare the con-
cept of a programming language, such as Lisp, with its
various implementations or versions available at differ-
ent sites or times, and which are locally called Lisps as
well. A more common transition of a name is, however,
from an instantiation to a concept, which, ultimately,
can create a similar effect. Consider for the moment the
concept of a sun as a center (or one of several centers)
of a solar system, and our own Sun as a specific
instantiation of this concept. A schematic illustration of
the descent process is shown in Figure 2.
_ A process reverse to decomposition is that of ascend-
ing to a higher level within the level hierarchy. Suppose
that for some objects N I, N2, • • •, considered distinct at
Lo, we discover they share a certain property, such as
being an N, so that we need a generalizing concept to
talk about them. We pick up a coordinate T, and climb
onto some higher level LI, that is, Lo = LN,ir &lt; LN+17- =
LI, and establish a new object N there, a &amp;quot;superobject.&amp;quot;
Now, as viewed from LI, all N&apos;s are just the occur-
rences of N at different values of coordinate T. In other
words, the following equation holds:
F2. Vi [axe 71(N x) = Ni]]
Note that all Ni&apos;s now belong to the level Lr*__I&apos;IT, which is
a part of Lo. As before, we shall drop superscripts N and

T for simplicity. No matter how we name N at L+1, the
following Formula of Discovery summarizes our action:
F3. Vx,y E T [(N x) = (N y)]
It must be noted that (F3) is valid only when stated from
the perspective of L±1. At Lo, Ni&apos;s remain distinct
traditionally, so they remain distinguished in the lan-
guage as well; cf. Formula Fl. The generalization of
other objects from Lo onto L,1 may follow but, as in the
case of decomposition discussed earlier, the process
will largely remain implicit. These observations are
illustrated in Example 4.
Example 4. At level Lo, we have object TP, named The
President. Let T be the time coordinate (which is
different than T in the last two examples). At Lo, we
have, according to (F3), that Vx,y E T [(TP x)= (TP y)].
Later, we may discover that for some t1, t2 E T,
(TP ti)=N and (TP t2)=R, and that at some level LTPer
where N and R belong, they are considered distinct and
named Nixon and Reagan, respectively. But at Lo,
R=N is true. The last observation can be made clearer
if one imagines that TP is some abstract individual who,
when observed in the early 1970s, is named Nixon, and
who, when observed in the 1980s, is named Reagan.
As described, the case of generalization (or abstrac-
tion) is extremely common in natural language, and the
best tangible manifestation of this phenomenon is com-
mon nouns. Common nouns should be considered
names of generalized concepts, which may be either of
a physical or otherwise measurable nature (mass con-
cepts such as water, snow, gold, temperature, . . .) or
of a non-physical, abstract nature (usually based on
enumerable quantities of specific instances: tree, man,
president, . . .), or both (like fish, people, . . .).
Once the superobject N has been created, it begins to
live a life of its own. Some new objects from Lo,
different than Ni&apos;s, may now become instances of N at
some, as yet, unutilized values of coordinate T. Also,
we may use descriptions (N x) without caring whether
they actually refer to any objects at Lo. In other words,
the fact that a superobject N has no instance at certain
location x CT at level LNIT does not preclude the use of

the description (N x) in the language. The resulting
expression may not always be well defined, though, as
is in the case of &amp;quot;the present king of France,&amp;quot; where the
adjective &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; specifies the value of time coordi-
nate decomposing the superobject the king of France.
This problem of non-denoting expressions created out
of denoting general terms, which is widely discussed by
Quine (1960, 1973), receives an elegant explanation in
our theory. One remaining problem is the relationship
between a superobject and its instances in some given
decomposition. It is important that we do not equate a
superobject at L+1 with the set S of its instances at Lo,
even if they may have actually given birth to this
superobject. A superobject cannot be understood as a
set of appropriate lower-level instances, since we would
obtain only a measurable collection of singular objects.
Instead, a superobject N can be identified with a family
of functions {011 IT is a coordinate} such that each 4:1 is
a function from coordinate T into an appropriate lower
level, LN&apos;T. In particular, a superobject N at LP,T, where
P E Lo, can be considered (from Lo perspective) as a
function 4)7 from T into Lo such that, whenever
s ESCLO, then there is t E T such that 41 = N, = s.
The function 07 is then arbitrarily extended beyond the
set S. The following definition may be suggested.
Def. 5. Let L and M be any two distinct levels of
relatively singular objects. We say that level L is
lower than level M, L &lt; M, if there exists an object
P at level M and a coordinate T such that L DMT.
In order to avoid any misunderstanding, we add the
following remark. It is possible that some N., from
among the ist,&apos;s was already recognized properly at Lo as
our goal object N from L+1, although its other occur-
rences N, for i j were not identified with it (cf. the
Morning Star, the Evening Star, and Venus). In some
sense, therefore, the previous concept of N was incom-
plete, since it did not contain these other instances
which, in turn, allowed this former concept to coexist
with some of its would-be instances at the same level.
This fact can be further reinforced in our language when
we choose to name N after N. This should not suggest
that N and N j are one and the same object. The former
is in a sense more mature, although, when referenced by
name, one can hardly tell which one of the two concepts
is being referred to, unless, of course, some additional
clarifying context is present. Examples 5 and 6 below
further illustrate this point.
Example 5 We have the following distinct objects at
level Lo: V, called Venus; MS, called the Morning Star;
and ES, called the Evening Star. Upon discovery that
they all represent occurrences of the same planet, we
create a new object V&apos;, named Venus, at the level LI =
LIT, and such that for some x,y,z E T, where T is a time
coordinate, ( V&apos;x) = V, ( V&apos;y) = MS, ( V&apos;z) = ES, where
V&apos;, V, MS and ES are individual constants denoting V&apos;,
V, MS and ES, respectively. Using the formula (F3), we
conclude, from the perspective of L1, that V = MS =
ES, while the same conclusion made at Lo is false.
Example 6. Let the level Lo be as in Example 5, except
that the object V is discovered not to be uniform. In
fact, it contains occurrences of three different objects:
planet Venus and some two heavenly bodies assumed to
be Venus in the mornings and the evenings. Now we
cannot use our time coordinate T from the previous
example to get the desired result of the object V&apos; at L±1.
Instead, we first descend to Lvls&apos; over a coordinate S to
differentiate the objects V51, V52, V53 for some si, s2, S3 E
S. Let the V51 be a part of the ultimate object V&apos;. In the
same way, we create instances of MS and ES over the
coordinate S at levels PV&apos;s and LETs, respectively.
Because V, MS and ES are relatively singular, their
instances in decomposition with respect to the same
coordinate yield objects that are also relatively singular.
In other words, there is a level L2 such that L2 D Lv_15 U
U LEses. Let MS,, be called the Morning Star and
ESs, be called the Evening Star at L2. Now we can
construct the ultimate object V&apos; out of V51, MS52, and
ES53 using a coordinate T such that {51,52,53} C T and
V&apos;s, = V5, V2 = MS,,, and V&apos;s, = ES53. We place V&apos; at
a new level L3 = LV±Isl&apos;T. Note that L3 CL0, and thus that
V&apos; is singular at Lo.
Example 6 is more &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; than Example 5, but
both examples have equal linguistic significance. Note,
however, that having L2 as Lo, and L3 as LI, we could
reconstruct Example 5.

Let us examine how the foregoing theory of non-
singular terms could be utilized in assigning meaning
representation to natural language discourse. In partic-
ular, we are interested in the problem of computing
extrasentential dependencies in text.
The translation rules described briefly in Section 2
are applicable only when anaphoric references arise
between relatively singular descriptions or, as we would
say now, between descriptions denoting objects classi-
fied within the same single level. We show that a similar
technique can be used to compute another type of
extrasentential dependencies, which we call the remote
co-reference. Let us start with an example. The arrow
symbol is used here, and elsewhere, to mean &amp;quot;trans-
lates to&amp;quot;.
Example 7. Consider the following discourse fragment.
7a. The president, is elected every four years.
7b. The president2 is Reagan.
There is nothing to prevent us from interpreting the
president, and the president2 at levels LI and L2,
respectively, so that one of the following takes place.
Either LI = L2, or LI &lt;L2, or L2 &lt; LI, or simply LI #
L2, where &lt; stands for the extended lower-level relation
introduced in definition 5. The latter case does not
interest us, since, in such an interpretation, both sen-
tences were uttered at different occasions with no
connection between them.

Consider first that L, = L2 = Lo. If the two definite
descriptions were to co-refer then we would be talking
of the same object (individual) in both sentences. That
interpretation, although possible, does not agree with
our intuition. In this case the conclusion of
7c. Reagan is elected every four years.
follows immediately.
Let us assume next that L2 DLT,T &lt; L, = Lo, where
TP is the object at L, referred to by the president,, and
T is a time-based coordinate. If the president, is used as
a name, we can expect to obtain the following transla-
tions:

<equation confidence="0.927651">
7a ---&gt; eefy(TP)
7b 3t [SL(t) &amp; ((TP t)=R)]

with &amp;quot;elected every four years&amp;quot; --&gt; eefy, &amp;quot;the pres-
ident&amp;quot; --&gt; AP[P(TP)]
where t E T and SL is a selector over T provided by the
discourse situation (for example now, here, etc.). This
selector could be obtained if we consider a possible
translation of (7b) at L2 as pres(R) &amp; loc(R, now), from
which it follows that 3 tE T[((TP t)=R &amp; loc((TP t),
now)], with SL = At[loc((TP t), now)].
In a more general case, we would take the phrase the
president, as an ordinary definite description. Assuming
some external context C which allows for the use of the
definite article, the following translation can be derived:8
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9685778">
7a —&gt; 3r [p(r) &amp; C(r) &amp; Vy [(p(y) &amp; C(y))

((x t)=-R)]]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983421052632">
where &amp;quot;president&amp;quot; —&gt; p.
The first of these formulas can be interpreted, with
respect to some implicit context C (which may be
reasonably assumed to limit our attention to the U.S.
government), as: there is exactly one object such that it
is a president and has a property of being elected every
four years. Clearly, the object we refer to in (7a) is not
any particular person, but the office of the President of
the U.S. The other formula says, in turn, that there is a
value t of the time coordinate Tat which the instance of
the general object referred to in (7a) (the President of
the U.S.) is identical with the object R (which stands for
Reagan). Observe that R refers to the individual Reagan
as he appears at t, but not necessarily beyond that. The
latter formula gives the full translation of (7b) when the
remote reference to level L, has been resolved. Before
this interlevel connection is established, however, we
can assign (7b) only the a literal translation at L2, as
shown below, where C2 is a local context at level L2.

<equation confidence="0.936594">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999362571428572">
A point that is worth discussion is the role of the
selector SL in the full translation of (7b). This selector
may be interpreted as a local context at L2 determined
by a discourse situation, as in Barwise and Perry (1983).
To understand its influence on the form of the refer-
ence-making sentence, compare Example 7 with Exam-
ple 8 below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.738199">
Example 8

<bodyText confidence="0.994721727272727">
8a. The tiger lives in the jungle.
8b. My pet is a tiger.
Unlike (8b), in the &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; of the president the local
context allows (and requires) us to use &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; in (7b)
because there may be at most one instance of the
general term at a given discourse situation (in this case,
the President of the U.S.). This is not the case when
more than one value of the coordinate T satisfied the
selector condition. The use of a definite description in
such a context suggests, therefore, that a single instance
of a general term is being picked up by the selector. This
means, in turn, that except for a main &amp;quot;remote refer-
ence&amp;quot; in cross-level referencing, another local refer-
ence is being made at these levels where the definite
description is used to denote some object. The remote
reference itself does not need a definite description to
be used for establishing a connection between an in-
stance and the general term. The fact that we use a
definite article when referring to an instance of a general
concept, as in (7b), implies only that the local context
SL contains (or is expected to contain) exactly one
instance of the general object. Notice that the temporal
aspect of this local context is extremely influentia1.9
When we decompose a general object with respect to a
time coordinate, we are more likely to obtain a unique
instantiation in a local context. However, when a coor-
dinate does not contain a time element, as in (8a,b), we
cannot, in general, exclude the possibility that instances
other than the one we intend to refer to in subsequent
statements may be present in a local context. Thus a
definite description is not used until the local context is
properly narrowed. In the case of (8a,b) above, for
example, we may continue the discourse at the lower
level, saying &amp;quot;The animal is quite friendly,&amp;quot; and mean-
ing &amp;quot;The animal which is my pet tiger is quite friendly.&amp;quot;
This discussion strongly supports our theory of
names and descriptions, particularly the existence of
levels and coordinates. Having established a higher-
level object (or superobject), we can freely discuss its
instances across various coordinates. The local refer-
ences can be accounted for by singular translation rules,
which we discuss in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986).
Finally, let us define the notion of remote reference
for objects classified into different naming levels.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.977151685714286">
Let us summarize this discussion briefly now. In some
part of a discourse, a certain (general) object X is
addressed; that is, there is some part, Si, of the dis-
course (presented as a single sentence in our examples,
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 181
Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse
for simplicity), such that S, predicates something of
X—that is S ,(X), where X is a description that refers to
X. In a subsequent part of the discourse, however, the
discourse changes the level of reference and only some
instance(s) of X with respect to some coordinate T is
addressed; that is, there is some t E T such that S2((X
t)), where S2 is this new part of the discourse. Appar-
ently, the discourse internal cohesion would be compro-
mised if we did not allow the higher level object X be a
target of a remote reference by a description (X t)
denoting one of its instances. In such a case we say that
Si(X) creates a supercontext for (X t). We can further
say that X and (X t) are remotely co-referential. By
analogy, if S, contains a reference to an instance of an
object X, that is, we have S ,((X t)) for some coordinate
T where t E T, and S2 contains a reference to X, that is,
S2(X), then S i((X t)) is a subcontext for X. In this case
too, X and (X t) are remotely co-referential.
We have just arrived at a very important property of
a natural language discourse, which influences both
coherence and cohesion, and is absolutely essential in
proper representation of discourse meaning content.
The following translation rule specifies how such a
representation should be derived.&amp;quot;) The approach pre-
sented here is entirely original, although the problem of
the &amp;quot;general term/an instance&amp;quot; connection has been
known for a long time and other, less general, solutions
have been suggested (see Partee 1972 and Montague
1974).

Thus far we have considered two types of cross-level
references: the trivial one where L, = L2 = Lo, and the
remote reference in supercontext, that is, with L, &lt;L2
= Lo. Let us now turn to the remaining type, for which
Lo = L1 &lt;L2. We call such situations remote references
in subcontext.
Example 9. Let TP and T be as in Example 7. This time
suppose that we have the following situation: Lo = L, &lt;
L2 DLT1T, where tp is TP, for some t E T. Our discourse
may now look as follows.
9a. A presidenti sits in the first row.
9b. The president2 is elected every four years.
Sentence 9b has the following translation with a remote
reference to &amp;quot;the president&amp;quot; in (9a).

<equation confidence="0.990321666666667">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996534607843138">
where &amp;quot;sits in the first row&amp;quot; —&gt; sfr.
The formula translating (9b) says that the president, a
unique superobject denoted by x, is elected every four
years. The uniqueness of the president superobject is
determined by the fact that one of its instances with
respect to some space-time coordinate, identified in the
formula by the term (x t) where t is an element of this
coordinate, has the property of sitting in the first row.
One may wonder whether the use of the definite
description in (9b) is always necessary to maintain the
remote reference, since we rejected such a necessity in
supercontexts. It should be clear enough, considering
the level structure introduced earlier, that we can and
have to use definite descriptions in subcontextual ref-
erences. We illustrate this point with another example.
The problem is discussed at a great length in Strzal-
kows ki ( 1986).
Example 10. In the following discourse, the descriptions
a president, and a president3 refer to objects which are
not relatively singular and therefore do not belong to the
same level. Although the discourse seems connected
and coherent, there is no straightforward correspon-
dence between the two sentences.
10a. John wants to become a king rather than a
ipresident,
10b. That is because a president3 is elected every
several years, while the king rules for a lifetime.
Here a president, refers to an Lo-instance P, of an
L, ,-level object P2 specifically P2 E LAT. A president3
refers to some object P3, which is still non-singular from
the perspective of level Lo. P3 is an instance of P2 but
with respect to a coordinate T&apos; different than T. In other
words, P3 is placed on the level LP_2iT, which is not a part
of Lo. There is no direct correspondence between a
president, and a president3 beyond the fact that P2 E
LPAT fl LT.I&apos;r. It may well happen, however, that for
some coordinate U and some u E U, we shall have (P3
u) denoting Pi. This is why John would rather be a king
. . . . What relates these two &amp;quot;presidents&amp;quot; is a compo-
sition of two remote references: the one made by a
president1 to the object P2 (we may wish to call this
object the president2), and the other made by a
president3 to P2. This same effect will be produced if we
use other measurably singular descriptions like &amp;quot;every
president,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;some presidents,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;most presidents&amp;quot;
in (1013). If we had the definite &amp;quot;the president&amp;quot; instead
of indefinite &amp;quot;a president&amp;quot; in (1013), however, we would
obtain a clear instance of a remote reference in subcon-
text, that is, with P2 = P3. The objects and their
respective levels in the presidents case are illustrated in
Figure 3.

7 SUPEROBJECTS VS. PLURAL TERMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992088955555556">
We now examine the nature of superobjects, that is, the
objects placed at level L.&amp;quot;. In particular, we are inter-
ested in what sets them apart from their instances. Let
us again consider the term &amp;quot;The President&amp;quot; as referring
to the superobject TP at some level L+1 (cf. Example 7).
We may say that such superterm has the property of
collective referring to all of its instances at once, but
without necessarily making a reference to any of these
instances in particular. At level Lo, if we want to refer to
a set of objects, we use one of the enumerating quanti-
fiers &amp;quot;every&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;each,&amp;quot; or we use some sort of plural,
such as in &amp;quot;These presidents were married&amp;quot; (each). We
note, however, that most plurals, especially the so-
called &amp;quot;bare&amp;quot; plurals, like presidents, tigers, or meet-
ings can actually refer collectively, which makes them
akin of superterms, though many of these plurals can be
ambiguous between the collective and a non-collective
interpretations. Just like in the case of singular super-
objects, the objects denoted by plural terms, such as
presidents, tigers, Americans, etc., cannot be always
identified with the corresponding sets of lower-level
instances. It turns out that the plural terms actually
denote superobjects,&amp;quot; and therefore they should be
interpreted at the same level as respective singular
superterms. We will see that the generalization leads
naturally to plural terms that may or may not induce
equivalent singular superterms. Conversely, a plural
equivalent to a singular term may suggest the most
natural coordinate to decompose the superobject in its
denotation into lower-level instances. When a singular
term lacks a plural equivalent, however, we may admit
that the object in its denotation is not naturally decom-
posable and that we are now looking at the bottom-most
level in some decomposition hierarchy. A further de-
composition may be still possible, but it can only
produce objects that will never assume an independent
status and will remain recognized only as instances of
some more general superobject scattered over that or
another coordinate. This phenomenon is characteristic
of so-called mass objects and their corresponding mass
terms. As an example, consider such nouns as water,
gold, or heat. They lack plural equivalents, and there is
no obvious way to decompose them into lower-level
instances, except with 4—dimensional space-time coor-
dinate. Note that although we can occasionally use a
morphologically plural term, like waters, these usually
will not be equivalent to singular superterms, and they
will often denote other mass objects as well, such as in
&amp;quot;waters of the Nile.&amp;quot; Space-time coordinates can also
be used to obtain instances of otherwise non-decompos-
able entities, such as John, into space-time slices, called
&amp;quot;stages&amp;quot; (Carlson 1982). Quite naturally, the question
of where one level ends and another begins arises. The
following two examples provide some insight into the
level-boundary problem.
Example 11. Consider the following sentences.
I la. Mary brings (some) water every day.
11b. John picks up the mail every morning.
Let &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; in (11a) be the name of some superobject
W at level L+1. Presumably, Mary brings only a part of
W, but we can say that W is being brought by Mary
every day. This is the same W every day, although each
time possibly a different part of it is in transit, which
leads to the obvious translation (at L.&amp;quot;),
i. lla brings-every-day(M,W)
where M and W are individual constants denoting L.&amp;quot;
objects M (Mary) and W (water). Alternatively, if we
evaluate (11a) at level Lo = Lw_ ir with a space-time
coordinate T, in which case (11a) should read &amp;quot;Mary
brings some water every day,&amp;quot; we obtain the following
interpretation:
ii. 1 la Vx [day(x) D 3t [brings(x, M, (W
where W is as before, M is an individual constant
denoting a space-time stage of Mary,&apos; and brings(x,y,z)
should be read at x y brings z. Now (W 0 denotes some
instance of the superobject W at level Lo, of which we
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 183

can say that it is water as well; that is, water((W t)). At
Lo, we replace (W t) by a singular variable u, obtaining
ii&apos;. 1 la —&gt; Vx [d(x) D 3u [water(u) &amp; brings(x, M, u)]]
The translations featured in (i), (ii), and (ii&apos;) may appear
to be equivalent statements made from different per-
spectives and at different levels of detail. This is not the
case, though. In particular, (ii) and (ii&apos;) are not equiva-
lent. This point is further illustrated with (11b). Let m be
the mail that John is picking up at any one particular
occasion. There is a space-time coordinate T such that
the level Lin, IT contains a unique superobject for which
the following holds.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993487">
1 lb —&gt; 3x [mail(x) &amp; C(x) &amp; Vy [(mail(y) &amp; C(y))
D (x = y)] &amp; picks-ev-morn(J, x)]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983974">
The context C is used to determine the uniqueness of
John&apos;s mail superobject. Note that the quantification
ranges over objects at LTV.. Because John&apos;s mail super-
object is decomposable with T we obtain the following
equivalent cross-level interpretation.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8204625">
iv. 1 lb —&gt; 3x [mail(x) &amp; C(x) &amp; Vy [(mail(y) &amp; C(y))

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947571428571">
Here, t ranges over elements of coordinate T, and (x t)
refers to an Lo instance of John&apos;s mail superobject. The
three arguments of picks(x,y,z) are understood as at x y
picks up z. As it stands, (iv) still needs to be interpreted
at LIT. To reduce this translation to the form that
would be interpretable at Lo, we have to replace the
definite reference in the first line of (iv), that is,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9921585">
3x [mail(x) &amp; C(x) &amp; Vy[(mail(y) &amp; C(y))

<bodyText confidence="0.997270119047619">
with a predicate, interpretable at Lo, that would
uniquely indicate John&apos;s mail. Then replacing (x t) by a
variable z, we obtain the following formula.
iv&apos;. Vu [morn(u) D 3z [John&apos;s-mail(z) &amp;
picks(u, J, z)]]
Note that equivalence to (iv) requires the John&apos;s-mail
predicate to be true of an empty z, which can happen if,
at some occasion, John receives no mail at all. Other-
wise (iv) and (iv&apos;) are not equivalent. In (iv) we can
maintain truth of picks (u,J,(x t)) because we do not
require (x t) to denote anything at Lo; we merely say
that a t exists. This example actually shows the power
of the multilevel representation. Observe that we have
just delivered a very strong argument supporting the
claim that superobjects are not merely sets of their
instances. It must be noted here again (cf. footnote 7)
that some limit needs to be set up for the amount of
exceptions to a general statement like (iv) that we are
willing to tolerate.
There remains one more reading of (11b) that does
not seem to require any reference to higher-level ob-
jects. This reading could be paraphrased as: Every
morning there exists the mail such that John picks it up,
or more formally
v. 11b —&gt; Vx[morn(x) D 3u [mail(u) &amp; C(u) &amp;
Vyl(mail(y) &amp; C(y)) D (u = y)] &amp; picks(x,J,u)]
This time the variable u is bound at Lo. Is this transla-
tion feasible? We can answer both &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot; A
&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; answer indicates that the transformation gives us
a singular interpretation of (1 lb) at Lo. Note that be-
cause of the uniqueness clause in it, (v) says no more
than that John keeps picking up the same thing every
morning, since the context C does not depend on x and
is the same each time. A &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; answer indicates that the
latter interpretation most probably does not express our
intention. The translation of (v), although possible, is
not equivalent to either (iii), (iv), or (iv&apos;).
At the beginning of this section we stated that bare
plurals, like presidents or meetings, behave much like
singular superobjects. Let us look somewhat closer at
this issue now. Consider the pairs of sentences (12a,b)
and (12c,d) below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.321025">
Example 12.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94549896875">
12a. The faculty meeting is held every month.
12b. Faculty meetings are held every month.
12c. The rat can live in most countries.
12d. Rats can live in most countries.
It seems to us that the preferred interpretation of
sentences in (12b) and (12d) is such that the plural noun
phrase (faculty meetings, rats) is understood as denot-
ing a higher-level concept. For the same reason as (12a),
and (11b) before it, (12b) will remain a truthful L+1
statement in spite of the fact that, at some occasions,
meetings can be canceled (due to holidays, for exam-
ple). In the case of (12c) and (12d) the point is somewhat
finer. This time we may be less reluctant to say that
(12d) means, in fact, that every rat can live in most
countries, because we talk about possibilities. There is
a catch in here, however; though every rat can live at
many different places, not every one, or perhaps even
none, can live at most of these places.
One of this section&apos;s key observations is that plural
terms are, in many respects, equivalent to singular
superterms. We can assume, for now, that plural terms,
cautiously named prototypes of superterms, actually
denote superobjects as well. For some plural terms, we
can find equivalent singular versions like tigers—tiger,
presidents—president, etc. Others do not have this
property. Alternatively, mass terms will usually lack
plural equivalents, for example, &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; cannot be
identified with &amp;quot;waters&amp;quot; in general. Still others may
expose a surprising mixture of the properties, like
&amp;quot;people,&amp;quot; which is a plural term with morphologically
singular form and which may also be used as mass
superterm.

reality, as perceived by an intelligent individual, can be
regarded as a partially ordered structure of levels such
that each level contains only those objects that are
considered relatively singular. Observe that there are
virtually no restrictions imposed upon the notion of
relative singularity, so that the distribution of objects
between levels of the world model may differ among
different individuals. Non-singular objects, called su-
perobjects, are placed at a number of higher levels,
which are related to the current level with various
coordinates. Conversely, a singular object may be de-
composed along a coordinate, and new objects, so
obtained, will be placed at some lower level. This same
coordinate can be used then to obtain instances of other
objects at this lower level, so that the relative singular-
ity of objects within each level is maintained. This
theory also contributes to a better understanding of
discourse internal cohesion by introducing the notion of
remote reference in text.
We believe that our approach promotes computa-
tional tractability of some more difficult properties of
natural language discourse. Among these, the notion of
intension as formalized by Montague (1974a-d) has long
been considered difficult for a practical realization, and
a more tractable alternative has been sought ever since.
Our theory of names and descriptions takes us a step in
this direction, although an implementation or a formal
complexity evaluation have yet to be attempted. Ob-
serve that with the concept of superobject and coordi-
nate, we no longer have to identify general terms like
&amp;quot;temperature,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;president,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; with inten-
sions, that is, functions over possible worlds. Superob-
jects are not some mysterious, extra-world entities, but
they acquire a concrete status which makes them as
comprehensible as ordinary objects. In a simplified
account, our notion of coordinate can be loosely related
to the possible world theory&apos;s concept of index. The
coordinate is, however, far more selective than the
index. In a particular discourse situation, we can pick
up that aspect of intensionality of some concept that is,
at present, relevant to our understanding of the dis-
course. Our freedom in selecting that or another coor-
dinate is all important. Note also that structures of
coordinates may vary considerably. For example, a
pure time coordinate may consist of time points as well
as consists of time periods, and time periods are of
much greater significance in practice (examine &amp;quot;the
president&amp;quot; example). Coordinates connote more than
indices. They can be used to define a non-singular status
of an object which is otherwise purely extensional (the
examples of &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; from the last section). In this
sense, the concept of non-singularity has a local, and
often subjective, character.

NOTES
1. For Montague&apos;s system to work it is necessary that a possible
world is understood as a completely specified alternative reality,
and cannot be thought of as merely a different model, or a partial
situation (Montague I974a, Barwise and Perry 1985). Although
various &amp;quot;Montague-style&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Montague-inspired&amp;quot; approaches
to natural language processing have been proposed in computa-
tional linguistics (see, for example, Landsbergen and Scha 1979,
Bronnenberg et al. 1980) none of them ever attempted to tackle
a full-scale semantics for IL.
2. &amp;quot;Profiles: A gentle reign,&amp;quot; by Susan Orlean. The New Yorker,
Dec. 12, 1988, p. 50.
3. is in &amp;quot;is rising&amp;quot; and in &amp;quot;is ninety&amp;quot; are of course different uses of
the verb to be. This is the identity is in the second sentence that
we are concerned with here.
4. This example was suggested by one of the reviewers.
5. We use boldface to denote objects, and romanface to indicate
their names and other descriptions referring to them.
6. There is no connection between this and other drawings pre-
sented in this paper, and any semantic network formalism.
7. This is not to say that we can have just any amount of negative
evidence in the form of literals —11y((B t)) and still keep on
believing that fly(B). An empirical verification or refutation of
the latter will depend upon the number of instances seen and the
quantitative relationship between the positive and the negative
evidence (Strzalkowski 1989). Nonetheless, we have to be
prepared to accommodate exceptions, up to a point. The discus-
sion of these issues is beyond the scope of the present article.
8. A detailed discussion on how to produce such translations can be
found in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986) and Strzalkowski
(1986).
9. This is, quite clearly, due to the temporal aspect of the majority
of sentences produced in natural language discourse (use of verb
tenses and temporal adverbs).
10. Before a translation rule like one of these presented in this paper
can be used, a sentence must undergo numerous transformations
within the Stratified Model (Strzalkowski 1986). These transfor-
mations include, but are not limited to, morphological analysis,
lexical disambiguation, and syntactic parsing.
11. Quine (1960) seems to suggest this conclusion; refer, for example
to his double interpretation of mass terms (pp. 120-121).
12. To be precise, we should represent Mary-stage as (M t), that is,
as a term referring to an instance of the object M. However, our
naming convention discussed earlier allows for replacing the
definite description (M t) by the name of the Lo object in its
denotation. We utilize this option here.
13. This approach to representing non-singular concepts contributes
to the transformation Fn_, of the Stratified Model; see Strzal-
kowski (1986). In particular, rules 11 and 12 add greatly to the
explanation of text cohesion, about which transformation. Fn_1
is concerned, although they introduce some ambiguity into the
transformation.

<abstract confidence="0.994747714285714">We introduce a new approach to representing and manipulating various types of non-singular concepts in natural language discourse. The representation we describe is based on a partially ordered structure of levels in which the objects of the same relative singularity are assigned to the same level. Our choice of the representation has been motivated by the following main concerns: 1. The representation should systematically distinguish between those language terms that are used to refer to objects of different singularity, that is, those classified within different but related levels of the model; 2. The representation should capture certain types of inter-sentential dependencies in discourse, most notably anaphoric-type cohesive links; 3. Finally, the representation should serve as a basis for defining a formal semantics of discourse paragraphs that would allow for capturing the exact truth conditions of sentences involving non-singular terms, and for computing interlevel inferences. In this paper we discuss (1) and (2) only. (3) is currently under investigation and will be the topic of a forthcoming article. We believe that our approach promotes computational feasibility, because we avoid the identification of general terms, like &amp;quot;temperature,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;water,&amp;quot; etc., with intensions, that is, functions over possible worlds. In our theory, the concept of non-singularity has a local (often subjective) character.</abstract>

The literature describes numerous forms of non-singular concepts and corresponding to them non-singular terms that can be found in natural language discourse, including intensional (or functional), mass, generic, habitual, abstract, and more; see, for example, Montague (1974a), Lewis (1976), Barwise and Perry (1983), Quine (1960), Donnellan (1971), Vendler (1971), and Kripke (1972). In these and other writings, various treatments for the phenomenon are suggested, but many of them do not properly capture the distinction between singular and non-singular interpretation of linguistic descriptions. With the exception of intensional concepts, other forms of nonsingularity have not been given satisfactory formal representations that would account for their role in natural language discourse. Perhaps the most successful treatment of non-singular terms in language thus far has been presented by Montague (1974a-d</context>

One of the goals of the present research is to fill this gap. 4 NON-SINGULAR TERMS IN LANGUAGE Many philosophers and logicians, Quine (1960), Kripke (1972), Donnellan (1971), Vendler (1971), Montague (1974), and Barwise and Perry (1983), note that the usage of the italicized nominal phrases in Example 1 has a general or generic character, except for regular singular interpretations, which are only possible in some cases. Example 1. la. The king wears a crown. lb. The president is elected every four years. lc. Gold is a yellow metal. Id. Temperature is a measure of molecular motion. Hundreds of similar examples involving such non-singular terms, and corresponding non-singular objects, as water, heat, the Pope, the number, etc. can be devised. Unfortunately, there is no generally accepted account of these non-singular terms in</context>
<context position="29818" citStr="Barwise and Perry 1983" startWordPosition="4654" endWordPosition="4657">.3 2b. The president is elected every four years. The president is Reagan. Thus, Reagan is elected every four years. 2c. The tiger lives in the jungle. My pet is a tiger. Thus, My pet lives in the jungle. 2d. Americans drive big cars. John is an American. Thus, John drives big cars/a big car. The arguments in (2a-d) are normally considered invalid. Various researchers agree that the definite descriptions &amp;quot;the temperature,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the president,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the tiger&amp;quot; in the first sentences of (2a-c) should be interpreted functionally, that is, as intensions (Montague 1974d), or functions over situations (Barwise and Perry 1983). Note that if the descriptions were to be interpreted singularly or as enumerating all instances of a non-singular object (that is, statements containing them were understood as making claims about each instance), the reasoning would be valid. In (2d) the situation is somewhat more complicated, because every extension of the entity in the denotation of Americans is itself a compound entity, namely a generic entity. Thus, intensionality alone cannot explain why the first two sentences in (2d) appear connected. As a matter of fact, the reasoning displayed in (2d) is far more acceptable that tho</context>

The latter formula gives the full translation of (7b) when the remote reference to level L, has been resolved. Before this interlevel connection is established, however, we can assign (7b) only the a literal translation at L2, as shown below, where C2 is a local context at level L2. 7b 3x [p(x) &amp; C2(x) &amp; Vy [(p(y) &amp; C2(y)) D (x= y)] &amp; (x=R)] A point that is worth discussion is the role of the selector SL in the full translation of (7b). This selector may be interpreted as a local context at L2 determined by a discourse situation, as in Barwise and Perry (1983). To understand its influence on the form of the reference-making sentence, compare Example 7 with Example 8 below. Example 8 8a. The tiger lives in the jungle. 8b. My pet is a tiger. Unlike (8b), in the &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; of the president the local context allows (and requires) us to use &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; in (7b) because there may be at most one instance of the general term at a given discourse situation (in this case, the President of the U.S.). This is not the case when more than one value of the coordinate T satisfied the selector condition. The use of a definite description in such a context suggests, therefore</context>

In addition, the enormous complexity of any non-trivial system of possible worlds has proven to be disadvantageous for developing a computationally oriented application of Montague&apos;s theory (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).1 In this paper we do not attempt to improve on Montague&apos;s grammar; in fact, our approach does, in part, rely on Montague&apos;s method of coupling the syntactic and semantic processing in order to assign to a sentence its meaning or at least a meaning-representing formula. Nonetheless, we also perceive the limitations of Montague&apos;s method. It is not our intention here to</context>

If we accept Carlson&apos;s position, then our ontology of objects becomes far richer than before, and we need to impose more structure on our representation to reflect this new situation accurately. Indeed, Carlson introduces a special R relation into Montague&apos;s IL which allows him to create individual objects out of generic objects, as well as stages out of ordinary singular objects. Thus, &amp;quot;Max believes that dogs are here&amp;quot; receives the following translation, where m and d are individual constants denoting Max and dog kind, respectively (Carlson 1977): Ax[Bel(^3y[R(y, x) &amp; here&apos;(y)lim)lid) This formula says that Max believes that some stages of dog-kind are here. One problem with this representation is that we have no idea how these stages are to be identified, in other words, how do we decompose a kind-level object into stage-level individuals. If other types of non-singular terms denote in similar fashion, then we may need an even more complex model in which various stages (or levels) of object aggregation can be reflected.

The lower than relation between levels in the universe model derives from expanding the notion of instance over collections of objects. The relation introduces a partial ordering within the universe model and thus helps to trace changes in the reference level of discourse. The highly discrete approach taken here is favorably contrasted with other existing approaches to non-singular terms, including Quine (1960), Kripke (1972), Montague (1974), Carlson (1982), and others. While insights of Quine, Kripke and, perhaps even more so, Carlson are undoubtedly of great influence, they require reworking in more discrete terms.

If we consider this discussion, the so-called &amp;quot;attributive use&amp;quot; of singular definite descriptions as identified by Donnellan (1971), may be considered as addressing some abstract, higher-level, and therefore (in our interpretation) non-singular concepts. Carlson (1982) discusses the case of so-called &amp;quot;natural kinds,&amp;quot; a specific type among generic terms. He advocates the view in which generic terms are taken as denoting entities in the same way that singular terms do.

Indeed, Carlson introduces a special R relation into Montague&apos;s IL which allows him to create individual objects out of generic objects, as well as stages out of ordinary singular objects.

They lack plural equivalents, and there is no obvious way to decompose them into lower-level instances, except with 4—dimensional space-time coordinate. Note that although we can occasionally use a morphologically plural term, like waters, these usually will not be equivalent to singular superterms, and they will often denote other mass objects as well, such as in &amp;quot;waters of the Nile.&amp;quot; Space-time coordinates can also be used to obtain instances of otherwise non-decomposable entities, such as John, into space-time slices, called &amp;quot;stages&amp;quot; (Carlson 1982). Quite naturally, the question of where one level ends and another begins arises. The following two examples provide some insight into the level-boundary problem. Example 11. Consider the following sentences. I la. Mary brings (some) water every day. 11b. John picks up the mail every morning. Let &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; in (11a) be the name of some superobject W at level L+1. Presumably, Mary brings only a part of W, but we can say that W is being brought by Mary every day. This is the same W every day, although each time possibly a different part of it is in transit, which leads to the obvious translation (</context>

Example 1. la. The king wears a crown. lb. The president is elected every four years. lc. Gold is a yellow metal. Id. Temperature is a measure of molecular motion.

These transformations include morphological analysis, lexical disambiguation, syntactic parsing, computing extrasentential dependencies, and pragmatic evaluation in discourse context. In order to compute anaphoric, and other, dependencies between sentences in a discourse fragment, we first translate each sentence in the fragment into an intermediate, formal representation language. We call these translations literal or &amp;quot;context-less&amp;quot; because they are derived based solely on sentences&apos; syntactic structure. In fact, this transformation is done Montague-style (Montague 1974d) except for the intermediate representation, which, in the Stratified Model, is a A-categorial language A, rather than an intensional logic. For this presentation it is enough to say that A is a typed predicate-calculus language with A-operator. A formal definition of A is given in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986). Next, we 172 Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse proceed to compute various contextual dependencies of sentences, including extrasentential anaphoric links.

The context variable is introduced into the translation of a definite noun phrase containing a definite article, such as &amp;quot;the,&amp;quot; by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski 1986, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986). This rule generates literal translations of sentences without considering their context, and does so in PTQ-style, that is, by assigning to each syntactic operation in CAT a formula formatting operation in A (Montague 1974a). The next step is to resolve context references; we must find a binding for C occurring in S2 in the context provided by SI in order to obtain the final translation of the former. This intersentential dependency is captured by the translation Rule 2, which operates on the literal translations of both sentences delivered by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).

Note that if the descriptions were to be interpreted singularly or as enumerating all instances of a non-singular object (that is, statements containing them were understood as making claims about each instance), the reasoning would be valid. In (2d) the situation is somewhat more complicated, because every extension of the entity in the denotation of Americans is itself a compound entity, namely a generic entity.

We have just arrived at a very important property of a natural language discourse, which influences both coherence and cohesion, and is absolutely essential in proper representation of discourse meaning content. The following translation rule specifies how such a representation should be derived.&amp;quot;) The approach presented here is entirely original, although the problem of the &amp;quot;general term/an instance&amp;quot; connection has been known for a long time and other, less general, solutions have been suggested (see Partee 1972 and Montague 1974). Rule 11 (Supercontext Translation Rule): If the context-setting sentence Sj with the translation 3x [P1(x) &amp; Fi(x)] is interpreted at level Lf, where is an object satisfying sentence S2 when interpreted at level Lo, and S2 contains an unresolved remote reference P2, that is, S2 = 3Y [P2(Y) &amp; F2(Y)l, then the full translation of S2 is obtained as AQ[ACEMQ,c1(C i)l(Au[3 t[AY[P2(Y) &amp; F2(Y)1((u t))]l), where the supercontext C1 is Ax[P,(x) &amp; Fi(x)], and MQ,c abbreviates the following expression MQ,c = 3x[C(x) &amp; Vy [C(y) 3 (x=y)] &amp; Q(x)].

This same coordinate can be used then to obtain instances of other objects at this lower level, so that the relative singularity of objects within each level is maintained. This theory also contributes to a better understanding of discourse internal cohesion by introducing the notion of remote reference in text. We believe that our approach promotes computational tractability of some more difficult properties of natural language discourse. Among these, the notion of intension as formalized by Montague (1974a-d) has long been considered difficult for a practical realization, and a more tractable alternative has been sought ever since. Our theory of names and descriptions takes us a step in this direction, although an implementation or a formal complexity evaluation have yet to be attempted. Observe that with the concept of superobject and coordinate, we no longer have to identify general terms like &amp;quot;temperature,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;president,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; with intensions, that is, functions over possible worlds.

In order to compute anaphoric, and other, dependencies between sentences in a discourse fragment, we first translate each sentence in the fragment into an intermediate, formal representation language. We call these translations literal or &amp;quot;context-less&amp;quot; because they are derived based solely on sentences&apos; syntactic structure. In fact, this transformation is done Montague-style (Montague 1974d) except for the intermediate representation, which, in the Stratified Model, is a A-categorial language A, rather than an intensional logic. For this presentation it is enough to say that A is a typed predicate-calculus language with A-operator. A formal definition of A is given in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986). Next, we 172 Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse proceed to compute various contextual dependencies of sentences, including extrasentential anaphoric links.

The context variable is introduced into the translation of a definite noun phrase containing a definite article, such as &amp;quot;the,&amp;quot; by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski 1986, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986). This rule generates literal translations of sentences without considering their context, and does so in PTQ-style, that is, by assigning to each syntactic operation in CAT a formula formatting operation in A (Montague 1974a). The next step is to resolve context references; we must find a binding for C occurring in S2 in the context provided by SI in order to obtain the final translation of the former. This intersentential dependency is captured by the translation Rule 2, which operates on the literal translations of both sentences delivered by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).

Some authors, for example, Vendler (1971) and Barwise and Perry (1983), cautiously called them generic, or general (for example, &amp;quot;the king&amp;quot;), or functional (such as &amp;quot;the number of students,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the temperature&amp;quot;) uses of definite descriptions. Other authors, for example, Kripke (1972), were quite close to considering these kinds of non-singular terms as names (or at least some of them: heat, gold). Still other authors writing on the subject, for example, Quine (1960, 1973), advocated the notion of abstract terms as comprising of attributes, such as (being) red (further abstracted as &amp;quot;redness&amp;quot;), or Computational Linguistics, Volume IS, Number 3, September 1989 175 Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse (being) the man drinking the martini (which cannot be so easily nominalized), which can be predicated of &amp;quot;concrete&amp;quot; objects.

One problem with this representation is that we have no idea how these stages are to be identified, in other words, how do we decompose a kind-level object into stage-level individuals. If other types of non-singular terms denote in similar fashion, then we may need an even more complex model in which various stages (or levels) of object aggregation can be reflected. Quine (1960) presents the most comprehensive account of various categories of terms found among natural language expressions. Almost everything that one can say is made up of different kinds of terms, appropriately connected to yield meaningful utterances, which he classifies as singular, general, relative, abstract, attributive, etc. At present, we do not draw such fine distinctions in our classification, reserving the right to develop extensions along the lines of Quine as needed. We present a few examples to provide additional insight and lay the foundation for our theory of names and descriptions. The</context>

The resulting expression may not always be well defined, though, as is in the case of &amp;quot;the present king of France,&amp;quot; where the adjective &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; specifies the value of time coordinate decomposing the superobject the king of France. This problem of non-denoting expressions created out of denoting general terms, which is widely discussed by Quine (1960, 1973), receives an elegant explanation in our theory. One remaining problem is the relationship between a superobject and its instances in some given decomposition. It is important that we do not equate a superobject at L+1 with the set S of its instances at Lo, even if they may have actually given birth to this superobject. A superobject cannot be understood as a set of appropriate lower-level instances, since we would obtain only a measurable collection of singular objects.

In addition, the enormous complexity of any non-trivial system of possible worlds has proven to be disadvantageous for developing a computationally oriented application of Montague&apos;s theory (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).1 In this paper we do not attempt to improve on Montague&apos;s grammar; in fact, our approach does, in part, rely on Montague&apos;s method of coupling the syntactic and semantic processing in order to assign to a sentence its meaning or at least a meaning-representing formula. Nonetheless, we also perceive the limitations of Montague&apos;s method.

In its present form, our theory focuses entirely on the problems of non-singularity and remote references in discourse that are created by the use of definite descriptions, bare plurals, and proper names. We do not describe in detail how one could actually compute remote references in discourse, except for two general rules introduced in Section 6. These rules, and perhaps some others yet to be developed, create a natural expansion of the system for computing intersentential anaphoric references described in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986). Except for a brief overview in Section 2, we do not discuss many related phenomena, such as non-remote (or single level) references, opaque readings, non-referential interpretations, use of personal pronouns, and the like. The more general theory of stratified meaning representation (Strzalkowski 1986) addresses all of these concerns, as well as the problems of discourse coherence, selecting proper cohesive links in discourse, and building a discourse model. 2 COMPUTING INTERSENTENTIAL DEPENDENCIES IN DISCOURSE A first step toward automating the process of discourse understanding is to grasp</context>

Utterances, or sentences, making up a discourse are usually involved in complicated mutual dependencies, that often go beyond the text itself. A careful study of these extrasentential and intersentential dependencies in discourse is necessary before a more successful attempt to design an automated discourse understanding system can be undertaken. In Strzalkowski (1986) and Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986) we introduced a rigorous method for handling certain cases of extrasentential dependencies in discourse, within a general framework, which we call the Stratified Model. The Stratified Model comprises a collection of disambiguating transformations that are applied to a discourse fragment before it can be assigned a final representation. These transformations include morphological analysis, lexical disambiguation, syntactic parsing, computing extrasentential dependencies, and pragmatic evaluation in discourse context. In order to compute anaphoric, and other, dependencies between sentences in a</context>

We call these translations literal or &amp;quot;context-less&amp;quot; because they are derived based solely on sentences&apos; syntactic structure. In fact, this transformation is done Montague-style (Montague 1974d) except for the intermediate representation, which, in the Stratified Model, is a A-categorial language A, rather than an intensional logic. For this presentation it is enough to say that A is a typed predicate-calculus language with A-operator. A formal definition of A is given in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986). Next, we 172 Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse proceed to compute various contextual dependencies of sentences, including extrasentential anaphoric links. Let L be a language of parse structures obtained in some grammar of a fragment of English. For the purpose of this presentation, L is identified with the set of phrase markers that can be generated from English sentences with a categorial grammar CAT similar to that of Montague (1974). Although some other syntactic system ma</context>

S —&gt; 3 x[cand(x) &amp; int(J ,x)] S2 3x[guy(x) &amp; C(x) &amp; Vy[(guy(y) &amp; C(y)) D (x = y)] &amp; had-imp-ref(x)] In the translation of S2, C is a free predicate variable that needs to be bound by the sentence&apos;s context. The context variable is introduced into the translation of a definite noun phrase containing a definite article, such as &amp;quot;the,&amp;quot; by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski 1986, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986). This rule generates literal translations of sentences without considering their context, and does so in PTQ-style, that is, by assigning to each syntactic operation in CAT a formula formatting operation in A (Montague 1974a). The next step is to resolve context references; we must find a binding for C occurring in S2 in the context provided by SI in order to obtain the final translation of the former. This intersentential dependency is captured by the translation Rule 2, which operates on the literal translations of both sentences delivered by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986). In the e</context>

In Rule 3, all this is reduced to the formula with the imp operator which translates compound phrases, such as &amp;quot;John wants,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;John will.&amp;quot; Thus, in the example given above, Rule 3 is applicable when both sentences contain a wide scope imp operator. In this case, the second sentence of the fragment obtains the full translation with the following formula: must(3x [girl(x) &amp; princess(x) &amp; marries(J,x) &amp; rich(x) &amp; pretty(x) &amp;Vy [{girl(y) &amp; princess(y) &amp; marries(J,y)} 3 (x=y)]]) Other studied cases of intersentential anaphora (see Strzalkowski 1986a-c, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986) include non-referential interpretation of discourse fragments involving attitude report verbs (believe, know, disagree). These cannot be translated with Rule 3, and a new rule, Rule 4, is developed to compute anaphoric links in texts similar to the one given below. John believes that a unicorn lives in the park. • He thinks the creature has a long horn. Rules 5, 6, and 7 account for the pronominal anaphora, Rule 10 deals with certain instances of attributive use of definite noun phrases. Rules 8 and 9 are used when the antecedent of an anaphor is a proper name rather than a description. This </context>

In the case of (8a,b) above, for example, we may continue the discourse at the lower level, saying &amp;quot;The animal is quite friendly,&amp;quot; and meaning &amp;quot;The animal which is my pet tiger is quite friendly.&amp;quot; This discussion strongly supports our theory of names and descriptions, particularly the existence of levels and coordinates. Having established a higherlevel object (or superobject), we can freely discuss its instances across various coordinates. The local references can be accounted for by singular translation rules, which we discuss in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986). Finally, let us define the notion of remote reference for objects classified into different naming levels. Def. 6. An object N at a level L„ is said to be remotely referenced by a description M if M refers to an object M at some level Lm such that either L„, D L , or L„,Dair, for some coordinate T. Let us summarize this discussion briefly now.

The literature describes numerous forms of non-singular concepts and corresponding to them non-singular terms that can be found in natural language discourse, including intensional (or functional), mass, generic, habitual, abstract, and more; see, for example, Montague (1974a), Lewis (1976), Barwise and Perry (1983), Quine (1960), Donnellan (1971), Vendler (1971), and Kripke (1972). In these and other writings, various treatments for the phenomenon are suggested, but many of them do not properly capture the distinction between singular and non-singular interpretation of linguistic descriptions. With the exception of intensional concepts, other forms of nonsingularity have not been given satisfactory formal representations that would account for their role in natural language discourse. Perhaps the most successful treatment of non-singular terms in language thus far has been presented by Montague (1974a-d) with his formalization of intension, which can</context>

Finally, we may note that the research in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics has devoted relatively little attention to treatment of non-singular terms in natural language in general and in natural language discourse in particular; see, however, Sidner (1979) for some early attempts to recognize generics in discourse. One of the goals of the present research is to fill this gap. 4 NON-SINGULAR TERMS IN LANGUAGE Many philosophers and logicians, Quine (1960), Kripke (1972), Donnellan (1971), Vendler (1971), Montague (1974), and Barwise and Perry (1983), note that the usage of the italicized nominal phrases in Example 1 has a general or generic character, except for regular singular interpretations, which are only possible in some cases. Example 1. la. The king wears a crown. lb. The president is elected every four years. lc. Gold is a yellow metal. Id. Temperature is a measure of molecular motion. Hundreds of similar examples involving such non-singular terms, and corresponding non-singular objects, as water, heat, the Pope, the number, etc. can be devised.

In Strzalkowski (1986) and Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986) we introduced a rigorous method for handling certain cases of extrasentential dependencies in discourse, within a general framework, which we call the Stratified Model. The Stratified Model comprises a collection of disambiguating transformations that are applied to a discourse fragment before it can be assigned a final representation. These transformations include morphological analysis, lexical disambiguation, syntactic parsing, computing extrasentential dependencies, and pragmatic evaluation in discourse context. In order to compute anaphoric, and other,</context>

In fact, this transformation is done Montague-style (Montague 1974d) except for the intermediate representation, which, in the Stratified Model, is a A-categorial language A, rather than an intensional logic. For this presentation it is enough to say that A is a typed predicate-calculus language with A-operator. A formal definition of A is given in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986).

The literature describes numerous forms of non-singular concepts and corresponding to them non-singular terms that can be found in natural language discourse, including intensional (or functional), mass, generic, habitual, abstract, and more; see, for example, Montague (1974a), Lewis (1976), Barwise and Perry (1983), Quine (1960), Donnellan (1971), Vendler (1971), and Kripke (1972). In these and other writings, various treatments for the phenomenon are suggested, but many of them do not properly capture the distinction between singular and non-singular interpretation of linguistic descriptions. With the exception of intensional concepts, other forms of nonsingularity have not been given satisfactory formal representations that would account for their role in natural language discourse. Perhaps the most successful treatment of non-singular terms in language thus far has been presented by Montague (1974a-d) with his for</context>

The lower than relation between levels in the universe model derives from expanding the notion of instance over collections of objects. The relation introduces a partial ordering within the universe model and thus helps to trace changes in the reference level of discourse. The highly discrete approach taken here is favorably contrasted with other existing approaches to non-singular terms, including Quine (1960), Kripke (1972), Montague (1974), Carlson (1982), and others. While insights of Quine, Kripke and, perhaps even more so, Carlson are undoubtedly of great influence, they require reworking in more discrete terms. Finally, we may note that the research in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics has devoted relatively little attention to treatment of non-singular terms in natural language in general and in natural language discourse in particular; see, however, Sidner (1979) for some early attempts to recognize generics in discourse.

Unfortunately, there is no generally accepted account of these non-singular terms in the philosophical literature. Some authors, for example, Vendler (1971) and Barwise and Perry (1983), cautiously called them generic, or general (for example, &amp;quot;the king&amp;quot;), or functional (such as &amp;quot;the number of students,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the temperature&amp;quot;) uses of definite descriptions. Other authors, for example, Kripke (1972), were quite close to considering these kinds of non-singular terms as names (or at least some of them: heat, gold). Still other authors writing on the subject, for example, Quine (1960, 1973), advocated the notion of abstract terms as comprising of attributes, such as (being) red (further abstracted as &amp;quot;redness&amp;quot;), or Computational Linguistics, Volume IS, Number 3, September 1989 175 Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse (being) the man drinking the martini (which cannot be so easily nominalized), which can be predicated of &amp;quot;concrete&amp;quot; objects.

One problem with this representation is that we have no idea how these stages are to be identified, in other words, how do we decompose a kind-level object into stage-level individuals. If other types of non-singular terms denote in similar fashion, then we may need an even more complex model in which various stages (or levels) of object aggregation can be reflected. Quine (1960) presents the most comprehensive account of various categories of terms found among natural language expressions. Almost everything that one can say is made up of different kinds of terms, appropriately connected to yield meaningful utterances, which he classifies as singular, general, relative, abstract, attributive, etc. At present, we do not draw such fine distinctions in our classification, reserving the right to develop extensions along the lines of Quine as needed.

This problem of non-denoting expressions created out of denoting general terms, which is widely discussed by Quine (1960, 1973), receives an elegant explanation in our theory. One remaining problem is the relationship between a superobject and its instances in some given decomposition. It is important that we do not equate a superobject at L+1 with the set S of its instances at Lo, even if they may have actually given birth to this superobject. A superobject cannot be understood as a set of appropriate lower-level instances, since we would obtain only a measurable collection of singular objects.

In its present form, our theory focuses entirely on the problems of non-singularity and remote references in discourse that are created by the use of definite descriptions, bare plurals, and proper names. We do not describe in detail how one could actually compute remote references in discourse, except for two general rules introduced in Section 6. These rules, and perhaps some others yet to be developed, create a natural expansion of the system for computing intersentential anaphoric references described in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986). Except for a brief overview in Section 2, we do not discuss many related phenomena, such as non-remote (or single level) references, opaque readings, non-referential interpretations, use of personal pronouns, and the like. The more general theory of stratified meaning representation (Strzalkowski 1986) addresses all of these concerns, as well as the problems of discourse coherence, selecting proper cohesive links in discourse, and building a discourse model. 2 COMPUTING INTERSENTENTIAL DEPENDENCIES IN DISCOURSE A first step toward automating the process of discourse understanding is to grasp</context>
