In this paper we report on several issues arising out
of a first attempt to annotate complex task-oriented
spoken dialog for rhetorical structure using Rhetor-
ical Structure Theory (RST):
a Relations needed (section 3.1)
a Identification of minimal units for annotation
(section 3.2.2)
a Dialog coverage (section 3.2.3)
a Overlap due to the subject-matter/presenta-
tional relation distinction (section 3.3)
We discuss how we are dealing with these issues in an
annotation scheme for argumentation acts in dialog
that we are developing.

We are engaged in the construction and implemen-
tation of a theory of content-planning for complex,
mixed-initiative task-oriented dialogs based on cor-
pus analysis, for use in dialog systems such as the
TRIPS system (Allen et al., 2000)1. Our basic
premise is that a conversational agent should be able
to produce whatever a human can produce in simi-
lar discourse situations, and that if we can explain
why a human produced a particular contribution,

we can program a conversational agent to produce
something similar. Therefore, in examining our di-
alogs the question we must answer is &amp;quot;Why did this
speaker produce this?&amp;quot;.
RST is a descriptive theory of hierarchical struc-
ture in discourse that identifies functional relation-
ships between discourse parts based on the inten-
tions behind their production (Mann and Thomp-
son, 1987). It has been used in content plan-
ning systems for text (effectively text monolog) (e.g.
(Cawsey, 1993), (Hovy, 1993), (Moore and Paris,
1993)). It has not yet been used much in content
planning for spoken dialog.
Because the dialogs we are examining are task-
oriented, they are hierarchically structured and so
provide a natural place to use RST. In fact, in or-
der to uncover the full structure behind discourse
contributions, it is necessary for us to use a model
of rhetorical structure. Certain dialog contribu-
tions are explained by the speaker&apos;s rhetorical goals.
rather than by task goals. In example 1, utterance 3
is justification for utterance 1 but does not directly
contribute to completing the task.
Example 1
A 1 They can&apos;t fix that power line at five
ninety and East
B 2 Well it
A 3 Because you got to fix the tree First
The details of how to apply RST to spoken dialog
are unclear. If we mark rhetorical structure only
within individual turns (as has generally been the
case in annotations of text dialog, e.g. (Moser et
1996),(Cawsey, 1993)), we miss the structure in
contributions like example 1 or example 2. There
is also the question of how to handle dialog-specific
behaviors: grounding utterances and back-channels
(utterances that maintain the communication), and
abandoned or interrupted utterances.

In our first attempt to annotate, we removed
abandoned utterances, back-channels, and simple
acknowledgments such as &amp;quot;Okay&amp;quot;. We used utter-
ances as minimal units; utterances were segmented
using prosodic and syntactic cues and speaker
changes (see 3.2.2). We did occasionally split an ut-
terance into two units if it consisted of two phrases or
clauses separated by a cue word such as &amp;quot;because&amp;quot;.
Two annotators, working separately, marked one
complete dialog using Michael O&apos;Donnell&apos;s RST an-
notation tool (1997). They used the set of relations
in (Mann and Thompson, 1987), and some addi-
tional relations specific to dialog or to our domain.
Examples of the additional relations are given in fig-
ure 1. When we compared the results, the tree struc-
tures obtained were similar, but the relation labels
were very different, and in neither case was the entire
dialog covered. Also, the annotators found structure
not covered by the relations given. As a result, we
stopped the annotation project and started develop-
ing an annotation scheme that would retain rhetor-
ical relations while dealing with the difficulties we
had encountered. The rest of this paper describes
this new annotation scheme. An example of the type
of analysis we are looking for appears in figure 3.

3 Issues and proposals
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998464">
The issues we encountered fall into three areas,
which we will examine in turn: issues related to in-
dividual relations, dialog-specific issues, and issues
related to the well-known presentational/subject-
matter distinction in RST.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.975619">
3.1 Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845296296296">
The key in any annotation project, is to have a set
of tags that are mutually exclusive, descriptive, and
give a useful distinction between different behaviors.
The set of relations we used failed this test with
respect to our corpus.
As in earlier. work (Moore anti Paris, 1992). our
annotators found some of the relations ambiguous.
In particular, the differences between the motivate
and ju,stify relations and between the elaboration and
motivation relations were unclear (partly because
we did not distinguish between presentational and
subject-matter relations).
Some of the relations we used overlapped. The
elaboration relation is too broad; in some sections
of our dialogs almost every utterance is an elabora-
tion of the first one, but the utterances cover a wide
variety of different types of elaborations. Anticipat-
ing this, we had given the annotators several more
specific relations (see figure 1), but we also allowed
them to use the elaboration tag in case a type of elab-
oration arose for which there was no subtype. As a
result of the overlap, use of the elaboration tag was
inconsistent. The joint relation is also too broad.
Other relations were never used, although one an-
notator went on to look at several more dialogs. In
short, the set of relation-tags we used did not effec-
tively partition the set of relations we saw.
In our annotation scheme, we are taking several
steps to define relations more clearly, reduce over-
lap, and eliminate too-broad relations. Instead of
giving annotators an semi-ordered set of relations
with their definitions, we are giving them decision
trees, with questions they can use to clarify the dis-
tinctions between relations at each point (figure 2).
The annotators did not find the relation definitions
in (Mann and Thompson, 1987) particularly help-
ful, but we are including simplified definitions, arid
annotators are instructed to test against the defini-
tions before labeling any. relation. We are including
several examples with each definition, so that anno-
tators can obtain an intuitive understanding of how
the relations appear. Finally, we are providing arty
useful discourse cues that signal the existence of a
relation.
We are eliminating relations that overlap with
others. Where a relation appears to cover a variety
of different phenomena, as in the case of elaborntion,
we are using more specific relations instead. We are
eliminating the joint relation, as it gives no help-
ful information from a content-planning perspective
and annotators are tempted to over-use it.
One of the criticisms of RST is that there is an
infinite set of relations (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
The goal is to arrive at a mutually-exclusive, clearly-

With a model of adjacency pairs, we can.now han-
dle grounding acts such as acknowledgments. If an
utterance is clearly a back-channel or abandoned,
annotators are instructed to so mark it and leave it
out of further annotation.
RST in its original formulation does not cover en-
veloping or parallel structures or conventional forms.
However, even in task-oriented dialogs speakers oc-
casionally tell jokes. Furthermore, there are fixed,
structural patterns in dialog, such as form-filling
behaviors. These are frequently domain-specific,
and resemble schema_s [(McKeown, 1985), (Cawsey,
1993)]. While it. may he possible to give an RST
analysis for some of these, it is more accurate to
identify what is actually going on. Our annotation
scheme includes four of these, make.-plan, describe-
situation, list and joke. It also includes an adjacency
pair for greetings, a conventional form.
An annotated dialog extract illustrating most. of
these issues is shown in figure 3.

Our original use of utterances as minimal units
splits a cross-turn completion from the utterance it

have altered our segmentation rules to take care of
these difficulties. Our definition is that a minimal

One unit will be considered to succeed another if
it starts after the other.
This means that the standard segmentation of a
dialog into utterances may have to be modified for
the purposes of an RST analysis, although a segmen-
tation into utterances and one into minimal units
will be very similar. Annotators will start with a
dialog segmented into turns and utterances, and are
encouraged to re-segment as needed.

When one gets higher in the tree resulting from an
RST annotation, the spans typically begin to fol-
low the task structure or the experimental structure.
In the Monroe corpus, usually one partner tells the
other about the task, then the two collaborate to
solve it, and finally one partner summarizes the so-
lution (following the experimental structure). In the
TRAINS corpus usually one subtask in the plan is
discussed at a time (following the task structure).
Given the length and complexity of a typical dia-
log, it may not, be possible to achieve complete cov-
erage, even with our expanded relation set and the
use of schemas. If we can identify useful sub-dialogs
or can associate parts of a dialog with parts of the
task, finding annotations for each part may suffice.
For our domain, we have established heuristics about
when an annotator can stop trying to achieve cover-
age. An annotator can stop when:

3.3 The subject-matter/presentational

tion to act (Mann and Thompson, 1987). As Moore
and associates have explained in (1992) and (1993),
while the intentions of the speaker are adequately
represented in the case of presentational relations
by the relations themselves, in the case of subject-
matter relations the intentions of the speaker may
vary. Furthermore, these two types of relations ac-
tually come from different levels of relationship be-
tween discourse elements: the informational level
(subject-matter relations), and the intentional level
(presentational relations). RST conflates these two
levels.
Mann and Thompson said that, in the case where
a presentational relation and a subject-matter re-
lation were both applicable, the subject-matter re-
lation should take precedence. However, we would
like to have information about both levels when pos-
sible. In our annotation scheme the presentational
relations are split from the subject-matter relations
and annotators are instructed to consider for each
set of spans whether there is a subject-matter rela-
tion, and also whether there is a presentational rela-
tion. If there are two relations, both are marked. If
one covers a slightly different span than the other,
at the next level of annotation the span that seems
more appropriate is used.
In the following example, utterance 3 is justifica-
tion (presentational) for utterance 1, but it is also
in a non-volitional cause sitbject.-matter) relation-
ship with utterance 1. The annotator would be in-
structed to label both relations.

<bodyText confidence="0.999983285714286">
We would also like more information, at times,
about the subject matter in the spans of a relation.
The relation between a &amp;quot;When&amp;quot; question and an-
swer is question-answer, as is that between a
question and answer; but the first question-answer
forms part of an elaboration arid the second forms
part of a justification or motivation. In our annota-
tion scheme, we supply a list of content types, such
as time, location and number. The annotator adds
the content. type in parentheses after the relation tag
when required. This means that the annotator may
have to mark three items for a given set of spans: the
presentational relation (if any), the subject-matter
relation, and the content type (if required). We find

In recent years there has been much research on
annotation schemes for dialog. Traum and Hinkel-
man outline four levels of &amp;quot;conversational acts&amp;quot; in
(1992). &amp;quot;Argumentation acts&amp;quot;, including rhetorical
relations, form the top level, but this level is not de-
scribed in detail. DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997) in-
cludes speech acts and some grounding acts, but not
rhetorical relations. The HCRC Maptask project an-
notation scheme includes adjacency pairs, but not
rhetorical relations (Carletta et al., 1996).
The COCONUT project annotation manual al-
lows the annotator to mark individual utter-
ances as elaboration, and segments as summary,
act:condition, act:consequence or otherinfo
genio et al., 1998). This annotation scheme does
not treat rhetorical structure separately from other
types of dialog behavior. We have observed enough_
structure in the corpora we have looked at to jus-
tify treating rhetorical structure as a separate, im-
portant phenomenon. For instance, in a DANISL-
tagged set of 8 dialogs in our corpus, 40% of the
utterances were statements, and many of these ap-
peared in sequences of statements. The relationships
between many of these statements are unclear with-
out a model of rhetorical structure.
In (1999), Nakatani and Traum describe a hierar-
chical annotation of dialog for I-units, based on the
..damthation and satisfaction-precedence relations of
(Grosz and Sidner, 1986). Other researchers have
shown that Grosz and Sidner&apos;s model of discourse
structure (GST) and RST are similar in many re-
spects [(Moser and Moore, 1996), (Marcu, 1999)].
However, RST provides more specific relations than
GST, and this is useful for content planning. As
well as helping., to specify generation goals, content
arid ordering constraints, the rhetorical information
is needed in case the system has to explain what it
has said.
&amp;quot;IA rough draft is a.vailahte from the author.
RDA is an annotation scheme for identifying
rhetorical structure in explanatory texts in the
SHERLOCK domain (Moser et al., 1996). We follow
RDA in requiring annotators to consider both in-
tentional and informational relations. However, be-
cause of the dialog issues previously described, RDA
is not sufficient for dialog.
Marcu uses discourse ..cues -to-automatically un-
cover rhetorical relations in text (1997). Much of
this work is applicable to the problem of uncovering
rhetorical relations in dialog; however, many cues
in dialog are prosodic and it is not yet possible to
obtain accurate information about prosodic cues au-
tomatically.

We have examined several issues arising from a first
attempt to annotate spoken dialog for rhetorical
structure. We have proposed ways of dealing with
each of these issues in an annotation scheme we are
developing. Much future work is certainly needed
in this area; we hope that the results of our annota-
tion may form a quantitative baseline for comparison
with future work.

Other researchers have shown that Grosz and Sidner&apos;s model of discourse structure (GST) and RST are similar in many respects [(Moser and Moore, 1996), (Marcu, 1999)]. However, RST provides more specific relations than GST, and this is useful for content planning.

We used utterances as minimal units; utterances were segmented using prosodic and syntactic cues and speaker changes (see 3.2.2). We did occasionally split an utterance into two units if it consisted of two phrases or clauses separated by a cue word such as &amp;quot;because&amp;quot;. Two annotators, working separately, marked one complete dialog using Michael O&apos;Donnell&apos;s RST annotation tool (1997). They used the set of relations in (Mann and Thompson, 1987), and some additional relations specific to dialog or to our domain. Examples of the additional relations are given in figure 1. When we compared the results, the tree structures obtained were similar, but the relation labels were very different, and in neither case was the entire dialog covered. Also, the annotators found structure not covered by the relations given. As a result, we stopped the annotation project and started developing an annotation scheme that would retain rhetorical relations while dealing with the difficulties we had encountered.

In our annotation scheme, we are taking several steps to define relations more clearly, reduce overlap, and eliminate too-broad relations. Instead of giving annotators an semi-ordered set of relations with their definitions, we are giving them decision trees, with questions they can use to clarify the distinctions between relations at each point (figure 2). The annotators did not find the relation definitions in (Mann and Thompson, 1987) particularly helpful, but we are including simplified definitions, arid annotators are instructed to test against the definitions before labeling any. relation.

With a model of adjacency pairs, we can.now handle grounding acts such as acknowledgments. If an utterance is clearly a back-channel or abandoned, annotators are instructed to so mark it and leave it out of further annotation. RST in its original formulation does not cover enveloping or parallel structures or conventional forms. However, even in task-oriented dialogs speakers occasionally tell jokes. Furthermore, there are fixed, structural patterns in dialog, such as form-filling behaviors. These are frequently domain-specific, and resemble schema_s [(McKeown, 1985), (Cawsey, 1993)]. While it. may he possible to give an RST analysis for some of these, it is more accurate to identify what is actually going on. Our annotation scheme includes four of these, make.-plan, describesituation, list and joke. It also includes an adjacency pair for greetings, a conventional form. An annotated dialog extract illustrating most. of these issues is shown in figure 3. 3.2.2 Identifying and ordering units In spoken dialog, both participants often speak at once, or one speaker may complete what another speaker says, as in examples 8 and 9.

Therefore, in examining our dialogs the question we must answer is &amp;quot;Why did this speaker produce this?&amp;quot;. RST is a descriptive theory of hierarchical structure in discourse that identifies functional relationships between discourse parts based on the intentions behind their production (Mann and Thompson, 1987). It has been used in content planning systems for text (effectively text monolog) (e.g. (Cawsey, 1993), (Hovy, 1993), (Moore and Paris, 1993)). It has not yet been used much in content planning for spoken dialog. Because the dialogs we are examining are taskoriented, they are hierarchically structured and so provide a natural place to use RST. In fact, in order to uncover the full structure behind discourse contributions, it is necessary for us to use a model of rhetorical structure. Certain dialog contributions are explained by the speaker&apos;s rhetorical goals. rather than by task goals. In example 1, utterance 3 is justification for utterance 1 but does not directly contribute to completing the task. Example 1 A 1 They can&apos;t fix th</context>
