This paper presents an unsupervised method
for deriving inference axioms by composing
semantic relations. The method is indepen-
dent of any particular relation inventory. It
relies on describing semantic relations using
primitives and manipulating these primitives
according to an algebra. The method was
tested using a set of eight semantic relations
yielding 78 inference axioms which were eval-
uated over PropBank.

<bodyText confidence="0.99983565">
Capturing the meaning of text is a long term goal
within the NLP community. Whereas during the last
decade the field has seen syntactic parsers mature
and achieve high performance, the progress in se-
mantics has been more modest. Previous research
has mostly focused on relations between particular
kind of arguments, e.g., semantic roles, noun com-
pounds. Notwithstanding their significance, they
target a fairly narrow text semantics compared to the
broad semantics encoded in text.
Consider the sentence in Figure 1. Semantic role
labelers exclusively detect the relations indicated
with solid arrows, which correspond to the sentence
syntactic dependencies. On top of those roles, there
are at least three more relations (discontinuous ar-
rows) that encode semantics other than the verb-
argument relations.
In this paper, we venture beyond semantic rela-
tion extraction from text and investigate techniques
to compose them. We explore the idea of inferring

a new relation linking the ends of a chain of rela-
tions. This scheme, informally used previously for
combining HYPERNYM with other relations, has not
been studied for arbitrary pairs of relations.
For example, it seems adequate to state the fol-
lowing: if x is PART-OF y and y is HYPERNYM of z,
then x is PART-OF z. An inference using this rule can
be obtained instantiating x, y and z with engine, car
and convertible. Going a step further, we consider
nonobvious inferences involving AGENT, PURPOSE
and other semantic relations.
The novelties of this paper are twofold. First,
an extended definition for semantic relations is pro-
posed, including (1) semantic restrictions for their
domains and ranges, and (2) semantic primitives.
Second, an algorithm for obtaining inference ax-
ioms is described. Axioms take as their premises
chains of two relations and output a new relation
linking the ends of the chain. This adds an extra
layer of semantics on top of previously extracted re-

ing an algebra for composing semantic primitives.
We name this framework Composition of Seman-
tic Relations (CSR). The extended definition, set of
primitives, algebra to compose primitives and CSR
algorithm are independent of any particular set of
relations. We first presented CSR and used it over
PropBank in (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011). In this
paper, we extend that work using a different set of
primitives and relations. Seventy eight inference ax-
ioms are obtained and an empirical evaluation shows
that inferred relations have high accuracies.

2 Semantic Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999308">
Semantic relations are underlying relations between
concepts. In general, they are defined by a textual
definition accompanied by a few examples. For ex-
ample, Chklovski and Pantel (2004) loosely define
ENABLEMENT as a relation that holds between two
verbs V1 and V2 when the pair can be glossed as
V1 is accomplished by V2 and gives two examples:
assess::review and accomplish::complete.
We find this widespread kind of definition weak
and prone to confusion. Following (Helbig, 2005),
we propose an extended definition for semantic re-
lations, including semantic restrictions for its argu-
ments. For example, AGENT(x, y) holds between an
animate concrete object x and a situation y.
Moreover, we propose to characterize relations by
semantic primitives. Primitives indicate whether a
property holds between the arguments of a relation,
e.g., the primitive temporal indicates if the first ar-
gument must happen before the second.
Besides having a better understanding of each re-
lation, this extended definition allows us to identify
possible and not possible combinations of relations,
as well as to automatically determine the conclusion
of composing a possible combination.
Formally, for a relation R(x, y), the extended def-
initions specifies: (a) DOMAIN(R) and RANGE(R)
(i.e., semantic restrictions for x and y); and (b) PR
(i.e., values for the primitives). The inverse relation
R−1 can be obtained by switching domain and range,
and defining PR−1 as depicted in Table 1.

2.1 Semantic Primitives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99668225">
Semantic primitives capture deep characteristics of
relations. They are independently determinable for
each relation and specify a property between an el-
ement of the domain and an element of the range of
the relation being described (Huhns and Stephens,
1989). Primitives are fundamental, they cannot be
explained using other primitives.
For each primitive, each relation takes a value
from the set V = {+, −, 0}. ‘+’ indicates that the
primitive holds, ‘−’ that it does not hold, and ‘0’
that it does not apply. Since a cause must precede its
effect, we have Ptemporal

The set of primitives used in this paper (Table
1) is heavily based on previous work in Knowledge
Bases (Huhns and Stephens, 1989), but we consid-
ered some new primitives. The new primitives are
justified by the fact that we aim at composing rela-
tions capturing the semantics from natural language.
Whatever the set of relations, it will describe the
characteristics of events (who / what / where / when
/ why / how) and connections between them (e.g.,
CAUSE, CORRELATION). Time, space and volition
also play an important role. The third column in
Table 1 indicates the value of the primitive for the
inverse relation: id. means it takes the same; op. the
opposite. The opposite of − is +, the opposite of +
is −, and the opposite of 0 is 0.

3.3 An Example: Agent and Purpose

We present an example of applying the CSR algo-
rithm by inspecting the potential axiom AGENT(x,
y) o PURPOSE−1(y, z) —* R3(x, z), where x is the
agent of y, and action y has as its purpose z. A state-
ment instantiating the premises is [Mary]x [came]y
to [talk]z about the issue. Knowing AGENT(Mary,
came) and PURPOSE−1(came, talk), our goal is to
identify the links R3(Mary, talk), if any.
We use the relations as defined in Table 4. First,
we note that both AGENT and PURPOSE−1 are com-
patible (Step 1). Second, we must identify the pos-
sible conclusions R3 that fit as conclusions (Step 2).
Given PAGENT and PPURPOSE−1, we obtain PAGENT o
PPURPOSE−1 using the algebra:

Out of all relations (Section 4), AGENT and IN-
TENT−1 fit the conclusion match. First, their do-
mains and ranges are compatible with the composi-
tion (Step 2a). Second, both PAGENT and PINTENT−1
are consistent with PAGENT o PPURPOSE−1 (Step 2b).
Thus, we obtain the following axioms: AGENT(x, y)
o PURPOSE−1(y, z) —* AGENT(x, z) and AGENT(x,
y) o PURPOSE−1(y, z) —* INTENT−1(x, z).

obtain inference axioms and, taking for granted that
annotation is available, evaluate their accuracy.
The only requirement for the CSR algorithm is to
define semantic relations using the extended defini-

use the ontology in Section 4.2. Values for the prim-

• INT(x, y) links an animate concrete object and the
situations he wants to become true, e.g., [Maryjy

• PRP(x, y) holds between a concept y and its main

• MNR(x, y) holds between the mode, way, style or
fashion x in which a situation y happened. x can
be a state, e.g., [walkingjy [holdingjx hands; ab-
stract objects, e.g., [diejy [with painjx; or qualities,

R1 o R2 —* R3 and R2 o R1 —* R3, the one in the mid-

two different effects of the same cause (a−1 o a

• The location and temporal information of con-
cept y is inherited by its cause, intention, pur-

• The AGENT of y is inherited by its causes, pur-

In all examples below, AGT(x, y) holds, and
we infer AGT(x, z) after composing it with R2:

It is important to note that domain and range re-
strictions are not sufficient to identify inference ax-
ioms; they only filter out pairs of not compatible re-
lations. The algebra to compose primitives is used
to detect prohibited combinations of relations based
on semantic grounds and identify the conclusion of
composing them. Without primitives, the cells in Ta-
ble 5 would be either empty (marking the pair as not
compatible) or would simply indicate that the pair
has compatible domain and range (without identify-
ing the conclusion).
Table 5 summarizes 136 unique pairs of premises
(recall RZ o Rj = (Rj−1 o RZ−1)−1). Domain and
range restrictions mark 39 (28.7%) as not compati-

detected for the same pair of premises, 78 inference
axioms are ultimately identified.

In order to define domains and ranges, we use a sim-
plified version of the ontology presented in (Helbig,
2005). We find enough to contemplate only seven
base classes: ev, st, co, aco, ao, loc and tmp. Entities
(ent) refer to any concept and are divided into situa-
tions (si), objects (o) and descriptors (des).

<listItem confidence="0.948007571428572">
• Situations are anything that happens at a time and
place and are divided into events (ev) and states
(st). Events imply a change in the status of other
entities (e.g., grow, conference); states do not
(e.g., be standing, account for 10%).
• Objects can be either concrete (co, palpable, tan-
gible, e.g., table, keyboard) or abstract (ao, intan-
gible, product of human reasoning, e.g., disease,
weight). Concrete objects can be further classi-
fied as animate (aco) if they have life, vigor or
spirit (e.g. John, cat).
• Descriptors state properties about the local (loc,
e.g., by the table, in the box) or temporal (tmp,
e.g., yesterday, last month) context of an entity.

5 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884178571429">
An evaluation was performed to estimate the valid-
ity of the 78 axioms. Because the number of axioms
is large we have focused on a subset of them (Table
6). The 31 axioms having SYN as premise are intu-
itively correct: since synonymous concepts are in-
terchangeable, given veracious annotation they per-
form valid inferences.
We use PropBank annotation (Palmer et al., 2005)
to instantiate the premises of each axiom. First,
all instantiations of axiom PRP o MNR−1 I MNR−1
were manually checked. This axiom yields 237 new
MANNER, 189 of which are valid (Accuracy 0.80).
Second, we evaluated axioms 1–7 (Table 6).
Since PropBank is a large corpus, we restricted this
phase to the first 1,000 sentences in which there is an
instantiation of any axiom. These sentences contain
1,412 instantiations and are found in the first 31,450
sentences of PropBank.
Table 6 depicts the total number of instantiations
for each axiom and its accuracy (columns 3 and 4).
Accuracies range from 0.40 to 0.90, showing that the
plausibility of an axiom depends on the axiom. The
average accuracy for axioms involving CAU is 0.54
and for axioms involving PRP is 0.87.
Axiom CAU o AGT−1 I AGT−1 adds 201 rela-
tions, which corresponds to 0.89% in relative terms.
Its accuracy is low, 0.40. Other axioms are less pro-
ductive but have a greater relative impact and accu-

5.1 Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936538461539">
Because of the low accuracy of axiom 1, an error
analysis was performed. We found that unlike other
axioms, this axiom often yield a relation type that
is already present in the semantic representation.
Specifically, it often yields R(x, z) when R(x’, z) is
already known. We use the following heuristic in
order to improve accuracy: do not instantiate an ax-
iom R1(x, y) ◦ R2(y, z) → R3(x, z) if a relation of the
form R3(x’, z) is already known.
This simple heuristic has increased the accuracy
of the inferences at the cost of lowering their pro-
ductivity. The last three columns in Table 6 show
results when using the heuristic.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999587045454545">
There have been many proposals to detect seman-
tic relations from text without composition. Re-
searches have targeted particular relations (e.g.,
CAUSE (Chang and Choi, 2006; Bethard and Mar-
tin, 2008)), relations within noun phrases (Nulty,
2007), named entities (Hirano et al., 2007) or clauses
(Szpakowicz et al., 1995). Competitions include
(Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005;
Girju et al., 2007; Hendrickx et al., 2009).
Two recent efforts (Ruppenhofer et al., 2009; Ger-
ber and Chai, 2010) are similar to CSR in their goal
(i.e., extract meaning ignored by current semantic
parsers), but completely differ in their means. Their
merit relies on annotating and extracting semantic
connections not originally contemplated (e.g., be-
tween concepts from two different sentences) us-
ing an already known and fixed relation set. Unlike
CSR, they are dependent on the relation inventory,
require annotation and do not reason or manipulate
relations. In contrast to all the above references and
the state of the art, the proposed framework obtains
axioms that take as input semantic relations pro-

duced by others and output more relations: it adds
an extra layer of semantics previously ignored.
Previous research has exploited the idea of using
semantic primitives to define and classify seman-
tic relations under the names of relation elements,
deep structure, aspects and primitives. The first at-
tempt on describing semantic relations using prim-
itives was made by Chaffin and Herrmann (1987);
they differentiate 31 relations using 30 relation el-
ements clustered into five groups (intensional force,
dimension, agreement, propositional and part-whole
inclusion). Winston et al. (1987) introduce 3 rela-
tion elements (functional, homeomerous and sepa-
rable) to distinguish six subtypes of PART-WHOLE.
Cohen and Losielle (1988) use the notion of deep
structure in contrast to the surface relation and uti-
lizes two aspects (hierarchical and temporal). Huhns
and Stephens (1989) consider a set of 10 primitives.
In theoretical linguistics, Wierzbicka (1996) in-
troduced the notion of semantic primes to perform
linguistic analysis. Dowty (2006) studies composi-
tionality and identifies entailments associated with
certain predicates and arguments (Dowty, 2001).
There has not been much work on composing
relations in the field of computational linguistics.
The term compositional semantics is used in con-
junction with the principle of compositionality, i.e.,
the meaning of a complex expression is determined
from the meanings of its parts, and the way in which
those parts are combined. These approaches are
usually formal and use a potentially infinite set of
predicates to represent semantics. Ge and Mooney
(2009) extracts semantic representations using syn-
tactic structures while Copestake et al. (2001) devel-
ops algebras for semantic construction within gram-
mars. Logic approaches include (Lakoff, 1970;
S´anchez Valencia, 1991; MacCartney and Manning,
2009). Composition of Semantic Relations is com-
plimentary to Compositional Semantics.
Previous research has manually extracted plau-
sible inference axioms for WordNet relations
(Harabagiu and Moldovan, 1998) and transformed
chains of relations into theoretical axioms (Helbig,
2005). The CSR algorithm proposed here automati-
cally obtains inference axioms.
Composing relations has been proposed before
within knowledge bases. Cohen and Losielle (1988)
combines a set of nine fairly specific relations (e.g.,
FOCUS-OF, PRODUCT-OF, SETTING-OF). The key
to determine plausibility is the transitivity charac-
teristic of the aspects: two relations shall not com-
bine if they have contradictory values for any aspect.
The first algebra to compose semantic primitives
was proposed by Huhns and Stephens (1989). Their
relations are not linguistically motivated and ten of
them map to some sort of PART-WHOLE (e.g. PIECE-
OF, SUBREGION-OF). Unlike (Cohen and Losielle,
1988; Huhns and Stephens, 1989), we use typical
relations that encode the semantics of natural lan-
guage, propose a method to automatically obtain the
inverse of a relation and empirically test the validity
of the axioms obtained.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938870967742">
Going beyond current research, in this paper we
investigate the composition of semantic relations.
The proposed CSR algorithm obtains inference ax-
ioms that take as their input semantic relations and
output a relation previously ignored. Regardless of
the set of relations and annotation scheme, an ad-
ditional layer of semantics is created on top of the
already existing relations.
An extended definition for semantic relations is
proposed, including restrictions on their domains
and ranges as well as values for semantic primitives.
Primitives indicate if a certain property holds be-
tween the arguments of a relation. An algebra for
composing semantic primitives is defined, allowing
to automatically determine the primitives values for
the composition of any two relations.
The CSR algorithm makes use of the extended
definition and algebra to discover inference axioms
in an unsupervised manner. Its usefulness is shown
using a set of eight common relations, obtaining 78
axioms. Empirical evaluation shows the axioms add
2.32% of relations in relative terms with an overall
accuracy of 0.88, more than what state-of-the-art se-
mantic parsers achieve.
The framework presented is completely indepen-
dent of any particular set of relations. Even though
different sets may call for different ontologies and
primitives, we believe the model is generally appli-
cable; the only requirement is to use the extended
definition. This is a novel way of retrieving seman-
tic relations in the field of computational linguistics.

We use the following heuristic in order to improve accuracy: do not instantiate an axiom R1(x, y) ◦ R2(y, z) → R3(x, z) if a relation of the form R3(x’, z) is already known. This simple heuristic has increased the accuracy of the inferences at the cost of lowering their productivity. The last three columns in Table 6 show results when using the heuristic. 6 Comparison with Previous Work There have been many proposals to detect semantic relations from text without composition. Researches have targeted particular relations (e.g., CAUSE (Chang and Choi, 2006; Bethard and Martin, 2008)), relations within noun phrases (Nulty, 2007), named entities (Hirano et al., 2007) or clauses (Szpakowicz et al., 1995).

Domain and range restrictions mark 39 (28.7%) as not compatible. The algebra labels 12 pairs as prohibited (8.8%, [12.4% of the compatible pairs]) and is unable to find a conclusion 14 times (10.3%, [14.4%]). Finally, conclusions are found for 71 pairs (52.2%, [73.2%]). Since more than one conclusion might be detected for the same pair of premises, 78 inference axioms are ultimately identified. 4.2 Ontology In order to define domains and ranges, we use a simplified version of the ontology presented in (Helbig, 2005). We find enough to contemplate only seven base classes: ev, st, co, aco, ao, loc and tmp. Entities (ent) refer to any concept and are divided into situations (si), objects (o) and descriptors (des). • Situations are anything that happens at a time and place and are divided into events (ev) and states (st). Events imply a change in the status of other entities (e.g., grow, conference); states do not (e.g., be standing, account for 10%). • Objects can be either concrete (co, palpable, tangible, e.g., table, keyboard) or abstract (ao, intangible, product of human reasoning, e.g., disease, weight</context>

Formally, for a relation R(x, y), the extended definitions specifies: (a) DOMAIN(R) and RANGE(R) (i.e., semantic restrictions for x and y); and (b) PR (i.e., values for the primitives). The inverse relation R−1 can be obtained by switching domain and range, and defining PR−1 as depicted in Table 1. 2.1 Semantic Primitives Semantic primitives capture deep characteristics of relations. They are independently determinable for each relation and specify a property between an element of the domain and an element of the range of the relation being described (Huhns and Stephens, 1989). Primitives are fundamental, they cannot be explained using other primitives. For each primitive, each relation takes a value from the set V = {+, −, 0}. ‘+’ indicates that the primitive holds, ‘−’ that it does not hold, and ‘0’ that it does not apply. Since a cause must precede its effect, we have Ptemporal CAUSE = +. Primitives complement the definition of a relation and completely characterize it. Coupled with domain and range restrictions, primitives allow us to automatically manipulate and reason over relations. 1457 1:Composable 2:Functional 3:Homeomerous 4:Separable 5:Temporal 6:Connec</context>

The set of primitives used in this paper (Table 1) is heavily based on previous work in Knowledge Bases (Huhns and Stephens, 1989), but we considered some new primitives. The new primitives are justified by the fact that we aim at composing relations capturing the semantics from natural language. Whatever the set of relations, it will describe the characteristics of events (who / what / where / when / why / how) and connections between them (e.g., CAUSE, CORRELATION). Time, space and volition also play an important role. The third column in Table 1 indicates the value of the primitive for the inverse relation: id. means it takes the same; op. the opposite.

The first attempt on describing semantic relations using primitives was made by Chaffin and Herrmann (1987); they differentiate 31 relations using 30 relation elements clustered into five groups (intensional force, dimension, agreement, propositional and part-whole inclusion). Winston et al. (1987) introduce 3 relation elements (functional, homeomerous and separable) to distinguish six subtypes of PART-WHOLE. Cohen and Losielle (1988) use the notion of deep structure in contrast to the surface relation and utilizes two aspects (hierarchical and temporal). Huhns and Stephens (1989) consider a set of 10 primitives. In theoretical linguistics, Wierzbicka (1996) introduced the notion of semantic primes to perform linguistic analysis. Dowty (2006) studies compositionality and identifies entailments associated with certain predicates and arguments (Dowty, 2001).

The CSR algorithm proposed here automatically obtains inference axioms. Composing relations has been proposed before within knowledge bases. Cohen and Losielle (1988) combines a set of nine fairly specific relations (e.g., FOCUS-OF, PRODUCT-OF, SETTING-OF). The key to determine plausibility is the transitivity characteristic of the aspects: two relations shall not combine if they have contradictory values for any aspect. The first algebra to compose semantic primitives was proposed by Huhns and Stephens (1989). Their relations are not linguistically motivated and ten of them map to some sort of PART-WHOLE (e.g. PIECEOF, SUBREGION-OF). Unlike (Cohen and Losielle, 1988; Huhns and Stephens, 1989), we use typical relations that encode the semantics of natural language, propose a method to automatically obtain the inverse of a relation and empirically test the validity of the axioms obtained. 7 Conclusions Going beyond current research, in this paper we investigate the composition of semantic relations.

This simplified ontology does not aim at defining domains and ranges for any relation set; it is a simplification to fit the eight relations we work with. 5 Evaluation An evaluation was performed to estimate the validity of the 78 axioms. Because the number of axioms is large we have focused on a subset of them (Table 6). The 31 axioms having SYN as premise are intuitively correct: since synonymous concepts are interchangeable, given veracious annotation they perform valid inferences. We use PropBank annotation (Palmer et al., 2005) to instantiate the premises of each axiom. First, all instantiations of axiom PRP o MNR−1 I MNR−1 were manually checked. This axiom yields 237 new MANNER, 189 of which are valid (Accuracy 0.80). Second, we evaluated axioms 1–7 (Table 6). Since PropBank is a large corpus, we restricted this phase to the first 1,000 sentences in which there is an instantiation of any axiom. These sentences contain 1,412 instantiations and are found in the first 31,450 sentences of PropBank. Table 6 depicts the total number of instantiations for each axiom and its accuracy (columns 3 and 4). Accuracies range fro</context>

The first attempt on describing semantic relations using primitives was made by Chaffin and Herrmann (1987); they differentiate 31 relations using 30 relation elements clustered into five groups (intensional force, dimension, agreement, propositional and part-whole inclusion). Winston et al. (1987) introduce 3 relation elements (functional, homeomerous and separable) to distinguish six subtypes of PART-WHOLE. Cohen and Losielle (1988) use the notion of deep structure in contrast to the surface relation and utilizes two aspects (hierarchical and temporal). Huhns and Stephens (1989) consider a set of 10 primitives. In theoretical linguistics, Wierzbicka (1996) introduced the notion of semantic primes to perform linguistic analysis. Dowty (2006) studies compositionality and identifies entailments associated with certain predicates and arguments (Dowty, 2001). There has not been much work o</context>
