Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99989716">
Language learners must acquire the grammar
(rules, constraints, principles) of their lan-
guage as well as representations at various
levels. I will argue that representations are
part of the grammar and must be acquired
together with other aspects of grammar; thus,
grammar acquisition may not presuppose
knowledge of representations. Further, I will
argue that the goal of a learning model
should not be to try to match or approximate
target forms directly, because strategies to do
so are defeated by the disconnect between
principles of grammar and the effects they
produce. Rather, learners should use target
forms as evidence bearing on the selection of
the correct grammar. I will draw on two
areas of phonology to illustrate these argu-
ments. The first is the grammar of stress, or
metrical phonology, which has received
much attention in the learning model litera-
ture. The second concerns the acquisition of
phonological features and contrasts. This
aspect of acquisition turns out, contrary to
first appearances, to pose challenging prob-
lems for learning models.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976822222222">
I will discuss the extent to which representa-
tions are intertwined with the grammar, and
consequences of this fact for acquisition
models. I will focus on phonological rep-
resentations, but the argument extends to
other components of the grammar.
One might suppose that phonological rep-
resentations can be acquired directly from the
acoustic signal. If, for example, children are
equipped with innate phonetic feature detect-
ors, one might suppose that they can use
these to extract phonetic features from the
signal. These extracted phonetic features
would then constitute phonological repre-
sentations (surface, or phonetic, representa-
tions). Once these are acquired, they can
serve as a basis from which learners can ac-
quire the rest of the grammar, namely, the
phonological rules (and/or constraints) and
the lexical, or underlying, representations.
This idea of acquisition by stages, with re-
presentations preceding rules, has enduring
appeal, though details vary with the prevail-
ing theory of grammar; versions of this the-
ory can be found in (Bloch, 1941) and
(Pinker, 1994:264–5). The idea could not be
implemented in American Structuralist pho-
nology, however (Chomsky, 1964), and I
will argue that it remains untenable today. I
will discuss two areas of phonology in which
representations must be acquired together
with the grammar, rather than prior to it. The
first concerns the grammar of stress, or
metrical phonology. The second concerns the
acquisition of phonological features. These
pose different sorts of problems for learning
models. The first has been the subject of con-
siderable discussion. The second, to my
knowledge, has not been discussed in the
context of formal learning models. Though it
has often been assumed, as mentioned above,
that acquisition of features might be the most
straightforward aspect of phonological acqui-
sition, I will argue that it presents challeng-
ing problems for learning models.

2 Representations of stress
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998368125">
Phonetic representations are not simply bun-
dles of features. Consider stress, for example.
Depending on the language, stress may be
indicated phonetically by pitch, duration,
loudness, or by some combination of these
dimensions. So even language learners gifted
with phonetic feature detectors will have to
sort out what the specific correlates of stress
are in their language. For purposes of the en-
suing discussion, I will assume that this
much can be acquired prior to further
acquisition of the phonology.
But simply deciding which syllables have
stress does not yield a surface representation
of the stress contour of a word. According to
metrical theory (Liberman and Prince 1977,
Halle and Idsardi 1995, Hayes 1995), stress
results from grouping syllables into feet; the
strongest foot is assigned the main stress, the
other feet are associated with secondary
stress. Moreover, some syllables at the edges
of the stress domain may be designated as
extrametrical, and not included in feet.
For example, I assume that learners who
have sorted out which acoustic cues signal
stress can at some point assign the stress
contours depicted in (1) to English words.
The height of the column over each syllable,
S, indicates how much relative stress it has.
However, these are not the surface represen-
tations. They indicate levels of stress, but no
metrical organization.

Looking at the word America, these repre-
sentations indicate that the first syllable A is
unfooted, that the next two syllables meri
constitute a trochaic foot, and that the final
syllable ca is extrametrical. Manitoba has
two feet, hence two stresses, of which the
second is stronger than the first. The Ls and
Hs under the first line of the metrical grid
designate light and heavy syllables, respec-
tively. The distinction is important in Eng-
lish: The syllable to: in Manitoba is heavy,
hence capable of making up a foot by itself,
and it receives the stress. If it were light, then
Manitoba would have stress on the
antepenultimate syllable, as in America.
How does a learner know to assign these
surface structures? Not just from the acoustic
signal, or from the schematic stress contours
in (1). Observe that an unstressed syllable
can have several metrical representations: it
can be footed, like the first syllable in
America; it can be the weak position of a
foot, like the second syllable of Manitoba; or
it can be extrametrical, like the final syllables
in both words. One cannot tell from the
sound which of these representations to as-
sign. The only way to know this is to acquire
the grammar of stress, based on evidence
drawn from the observed contours in (1).
Similar remarks hold for determining syl-
lable quantity. English divides syllables into
light and heavy: a light syllable ends in a
short vowel, and a heavy syllable contains
either a long vowel or is closed by a con-
sonant. In many other languages, though, a
closed syllable containing a short vowel is
considered to be light, contrary to the English
categorization. Learners must decide how to

classify such syllables, and the decision can-
not be made on phonetic grounds alone.

3 Acquisition of metrical structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990125">
How, then, are these aspects of phonological
structure acquired? Following Chomsky
(1981), I will suppose that metrical structures
are governed by a finite number of para-
meters, whose value is to be set on the basis
of experience. The possible values of a
parameter are limited and given in advance.1
Parameter setting models must overcome a
basic problem: the relation between a para-
meter and what it does is indirect, due to the
fact that there are many parameters, and they
interact in complex ways (Dresher and Kaye,
1990). For example, in English main stress is
tied to the right edge of the word. But that
does not mean that stress is always on the
last syllable: it could be on the penultimate
syllable, as in Manitoba, or on the antepen-
ultimate, as in America. What is consistent in
these examples is that main stress devolves
onto the strong syllable of the rightmost foot.
Where this syllable and foot is in any given
word depends on how a variety of parameters
are set. Some surprising consequences follow
from the nontransparent relationship between
a parameter and its effects.
The first one is that a learner who has
some incorrectly set parameters might know
that something is wrong, but might not know
which parameter is the source of the prob-
lem. This is known as the Credit Problem
(cf. Clark 1989, 1992, who calls this the
Selection Problem): a learner cannot reliably
assign credit or blame to individual
parameters when something is wrong.
There is a second way in which parameters
can pose problems to a learner. Some para-
meters are stated in terms of abstract entities
and theory-internal concepts that the learner
may not initially be able to identify. For ex-
ample, the theory of stress is couched in
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.5344775">

stress see (Daelemans Gillis and Durieux, 1994),

(Gupta and Touretzky, 1994), (Tesar, 1998, 2004), and
(Tesar and Smolensky, 1998).
terms of concepts such as heavy syllables,
heads, feet, and so on. In syntax, various
parameters have been posited that refer spe-
cifically to anaphors, or to functional projec-
tions of various types. These entities do not
come labelled as such in the input, but must
themselves be constructed by the learner. So,
to echo the title character in Plato’s dialogue
The Meno, how can learners determine if
main stress falls on the first or last foot if
they do not know what a foot is, or how to
identify one? This can be called the Episte-
mological Problem: in this case we know
about something in the abstract, but we do
not recognize that thing when it is front of us.
Because of the Credit Problem and the
Epistemological Problem, parameter setting
is not like learning to hit a target, where one
can correct one’s aim by observing where
previous shots land. The relation between
number of parameters correct and apparent
closeness to the target is not smooth (Turkel,
1996): one parameter wrong may result in
forms that appear to be way off the target,
whereas many parameters wrong may
produce results that appear to be better
(Dresher, 1999). This discrepancy between
grammar and outputs defeats learning models
that blindly try to match output forms
(Gibson and Wexler, 1994), or that are based
on a notion of goodness-of-fit (Clark and
Roberts, 1993). In terms of Fodor (1998),
there are no unambiguous triggers: thus,
learning models that seek them in individual
target forms are unlikely to be successful.
I have argued (Dresher, 1999) that Plato’s
solution – a series of questions posed in a
specified order – is the best approach we
have. One version of this approach is the
cue-based learner of (Dresher and Kaye,
1990). In this model, not only are the prin-
ciples and parameters of Universal Grammar
innate, but learners must be born with some
kind of a road map that guides them in
setting the parameters. Some ingredients of
this road map are the following:
First, Universal Grammar associates every
parameter with a cue, something in the data
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998956">
43
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997748">
that signals the learner how that parameter is
to be set. The cue might be a pattern that the
learner must look for, or simply the presence
of some element in a particular context.
Second, parameter setting proceeds in a
(partial) order set by Universal Grammar:
this ordering specifies a learning path (Light-
foot 1989). The setting of a parameter later
on the learning path depends on the results of
earlier ones.
Hence, cues can become increasingly ab-
stract and grammar-internal the further along
the learning path they are. As learners ac-
quire more of the system, their representa-
tions become more sophisticated, and they
are able to build on what they have already
learned to set more parameters.2
If this approach is correct, there is no
parameter-independent learning algorithm.
This is because the learning path is depend-
ent on the particular parameters. Also, the
cues must be discovered for each parameter.
Thus, a learning algorithm for one part of the
grammar cannot be applied to another part of
the grammar in an automatic way.3

4. Segmental representations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999683733333333">
Up to now we have been looking at an aspect
of phonological representation above the
level of the segment. I have argued that ac-
quisition of this aspect of surface phono-
logical representation cannot simply be based
on attending to the acoustic signal, but
requires a more elaborate learning model.
But what about acquisition of the phonemic
inventory of a language? One might suppose
that this be achieved prior to the acquisition
of the phonology itself.
Since the pioneering work of Trubetzkoy
and Jakobson, phonological theory has pos-
ited that phonemes are characterized in terms
of a limited set of distinctive features. There-

mans, 1995), (Bertolo et al. 1997), and (Tesar, 2004).

<bodyText confidence="0.998904205882353">
fore, to identify a phoneme one must be able
to assign to it a representation in terms of
feature specifications. What are these repre-
sentations? Since Saussure, it has been a
central assumption of much linguistic theory
that a unit is defined not only in terms of its
substance, but also in negative terms, with
respect to the units it contrasts with. On this
way of thinking, an /i/ that is part of a three-
vowel system /i a u/ is not necessarily the
same thing as an /i/ that is part of a seven-
vowel system /i i e a o u u/. In a three-vowel
system, no more than two features are re-
quired to distinguish each vowel from all the
others; in a seven-vowel system, at least one
more feature is required.
Jakobson and Halle (1956) suggested that
distinctive features are necessarily binary be-
cause of how they are acquired, through a
series of ‘binary fissions’. They propose that
the order of these contrastive splits, which
form what I will call a contrastive hierarchy
(Dresher 2003a, b) is partially fixed, thereby
allowing for certain developmental sequen-
ces and ruling out others. This idea has been
fruitfully applied in acquisition studies,
where it is a natural way of describing devel-
oping phonological inventories (Pye Ingram
and List, 1987), (Ingram, 1989), (Levelt,
1989), (Dinnsen et al., 1990), (Dinnsen,
1992), and (Rice and Avery, 1995).
Consider, for example, the development of
segment types in onset position in Dutch
(Fikkert, 1994):

At first there are no contrasts. The value of
the consonant defaults to the least marked (u)
onset, namely an obstruent plosive, desig-

nated here as /P/. The first contrast is be-
tween obstruent and sonorant. The former re-
mains the unmarked (u), or default, option;
the marked (m) sonorant defaults to nasal,
/N/. At this point children differ. Some ex-
pand the obstruent branch first, bringing in
marked fricatives, /F/, in contrast with
plosives. Others expand the sonorant branch,
introducing marked sonorants, which may be
either liquids, /L/, or glides, /J/. Continuing
in this way we will eventually have a tree
that gives all and only the contrasting fea-
tures in the language.
5. Acquiring segmental representations
Let us consider how such representations
might be acquired. To illustrate, we will look
at the vowel system of Classical Manchu
(Zhang, 1996), which nicely illustrates the
types of problems a learning model will have
to overcome. Zhang (1996) proposes the con-
trastive hierarchy in (4) for Classical Man-
chu, where the order of the features is [low]&gt;
[coronal]&gt;[labial]&gt;[ATR].

/u/ // // /a/
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994004462962963">
Part of the evidence for these specifica-
tions comes from the following observations:
(5) Evidence for the specifications in (4)
a. /u/ and // trigger ATR harmony, but /i/
does not, though /i/ is phonetically
[+ATR], suggesting that /i/ lacks a
phonological specification for [ATR].
4Zhang (1996) assumes privative features: [F] vs.
the absence of [F], rather than [+F] vs. [–F]. The
distinction between privative and binary features is not
crucial to the matters under discussion here.
b. // triggers labial harmony, but /u/ and
// do not. Though phonetically
[+labial], there is no evidence that /u/
and // are specified for this feature.
Acquiring phonological specifications is
not the same as identifying phonetic features.
Surface phonetics do not determine the pho-
nological specifications of a segment. Man-
chu /i/ is phonetically [+ATR], but does not
bear the feature phonologically; /u/ and //
are phonetically [+labial], but are not specif-
ied for that feature. How does a learner de-
duce phonological (contrastive) specifica-
tions from surface phonetics?5
It must be the case that phoneme acqui-
sition requires learners to take into account
phonological processes, and not just the local
phonetics of individual segments (Dresher
and van der Hulst, 1995). Thus, the phonolo-
gical status of Manchu vowels is demonstrat-
ed most clearly by attending to the effects of
the vowel on neighbouring segments.
This conclusion is strengthened when we
consider that the distinction between /u/ and
/u/ in Classical Manchu is phonetically evi-
dent only after back consonants; elsewhere,
they merge to [u]. To determine the under-
lying identity of a surface [u], therefore, a
language learner must observe its patterning
with other vowels: if it co-occurs with
[+ATR] vowels, it is /u/; otherwise, it is /u/.
The nonlocal and diverse character of the
evidence bearing on the feature specifica-
tions of segments poses a challenge to
learning models.
Finally, let us consider the acquisition of
the hierarchy of contrastive features in each
language. Examples such as the acquisition
of Dutch onsets given above appear to accord
well with the notion of a learning path,
whereby learners proceed to master individ-
ual feature contrasts in order. If this order
were the same for all languages, then this
</bodyText>

5Phonological contrasts that play a role in phono-
logical representations are thus different from their
phonetic manifestations, the subject of studies such as
(Flemming, 1995).

much would not have to be acquired. How-
ever, it appears that the feature hierarchies
vary somewhat across languages (Dresher,
2003a, b). The existence of variation raises
the question of how learners determine the
order for their language. The problem is
difficult, because establishing the correct
ordering, as shown by the active contrasts in
a language, appears to involve different kinds
of potentially conflicting evidence. In the
case of metrical parameters, the relevant evi-
dence could be reduced to particular cues, or
so it appears. Whether the setting of feature
hierarchies can be parameterized in a similar
way remains to be demonstrated.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.99254" genericHeader="conclusions">
6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980121212121">
I will conclude by raising one further
problem for learning models that is suggested
by the Manchu vowel system. We have ob-
served that in Classical Manchu, /a/ is the
[+ATR] counterpart of /a/. Both vowels are
[+low]. Since [low] is ordered first among
the vowel features in the Manchu hierarchy,
we might suppose that learners determine
which vowels are [+low] and which are not
at an early stage in the process, before as-
signing the other features. However, a vowel
that is phonetically [a] is ambiguous as to its
featural classification. In many languages,
including descendants of Classical Manchu
(Zhang, 1996, Dresher &amp; Zhang, 2003) such
vowels are classified as [–low]. What helps
to place /a/ as a [+low] vowel in Classical
Manchu is the knowledge that it is the
[+ATR] counterpart of /a/. That is, in order to
assign the feature [+low] to /a/, it helps to
know that it is [+ATR]. But, by hypothesis,
[low] is assigned before [ATR]. Similarly, the
determination that /i/ is contrastively
[+coronal] is tied in with its not being con-
trastively [–labial]; but [coronal] is assigned
prior to [labial].
It appears, then, that whatever order we
choose to assign features, it is necessary to
have some advance knowledge about classi-
fication with respect to features ordered later.
Perhaps this paradox is only apparent. How-
ever it is resolved, the issue raises an inter-
esting problem for models of acquisition.

<abstract confidence="0.999071576923077">Language learners must acquire the grammar (rules, constraints, principles) of their language as well as representations at various levels. I will argue that representations are part of the grammar and must be acquired together with other aspects of grammar; thus, grammar acquisition may not presuppose knowledge of representations. Further, I will argue that the goal of a learning model should not be to try to match or approximate target forms directly, because strategies to do so are defeated by the disconnect between principles of grammar and the effects they produce. Rather, learners should use target forms as evidence bearing on the selection of the correct grammar. I will draw on two areas of phonology to illustrate these arguments. The first is the grammar of stress, or metrical phonology, which has received much attention in the learning model literature. The second concerns the acquisition of phonological features and contrasts. This aspect of acquisition turns out, contrary to first appearances, to pose challenging problems for learning models.</abstract>

These extracted phonetic features would then constitute phonological representations (surface, or phonetic, representations).

English divides syllables into light and heavy: a light syllable ends in a short vowel, and a heavy syllable contains either a long vowel or is closed by a consonant. In many other languages, though, a closed syllable containing a short vowel is considered to be light, contrary to the English categorization. Learners must decide how to 42 classify such syllables, and the decision cannot be made on phonetic grounds alone. 3 Acquisition of metrical structure How, then, are these aspects of phonological structure acquired? Following Chomsky (1981), I will suppose that metrical structures are governed by a finite number of parameters, whose value is to be set on the basis of experience. The possible values of a parameter are limited and given in advance.1 Parameter setting models must overcome a basic problem: the relation between a parameter and what it does is indirect, due to the fact that there are many parameters, and they interact in complex ways (Dresher and Kaye, 1990). For example, in English main stress is tied to the right edge of the word. But that does not mean that stress is always on the last syllable: it could be on the </context>

What is consistent in these examples is that main stress devolves onto the strong syllable of the rightmost foot. Where this syllable and foot is in any given word depends on how a variety of parameters are set. Some surprising consequences follow from the nontransparent relationship between a parameter and its effects. The first one is that a learner who has some incorrectly set parameters might know that something is wrong, but might not know which parameter is the source of the problem. This is known as the Credit Problem (cf. Clark 1989, 1992, who calls this the Selection Problem): a learner cannot reliably assign credit or blame to individual parameters when something is wrong. There is a second way in which parameters can pose problems to a learner. Some parameters are stated in terms of abstract entities and theory-internal concepts that the learner may not initially be able to identify. For example, the theory of stress is couched in 1For some other approaches to the acquisition of stress see (Daelemans Gillis and Durieux, 1994), (Gupta and Touretzky, 1994), (Tesar, 1998, 2004), and (Tesar and Smolensky, 1998). terms of </context>

The relation between number of parameters correct and apparent closeness to the target is not smooth (Turkel, 1996): one parameter wrong may result in forms that appear to be way off the target, whereas many parameters wrong may produce results that appear to be better (Dresher, 1999). This discrepancy between grammar and outputs defeats learning models that blindly try to match output forms (Gibson and Wexler, 1994), or that are based on a notion of goodness-of-fit (Clark and Roberts, 1993). In terms of Fodor (1998), there are no unambiguous triggers: thus, learning models that seek them in individual target forms are unlikely to be successful. I have argued (Dresher, 1999) that Plato’s solution – a series of questions posed in a specified order – is the best approach we have. One version of this approach is the cue-based learner of (Dresher and Kaye, 1990). In this model, not only are the principles and parameters of Universal Grammar innate, but learners must be born with some kind of a road map that guides them in setting the parameters.

Following Chomsky (1981), I will suppose that metrical structures are governed by a finite number of parameters, whose value is to be set on the basis of experience. The possible values of a parameter are limited and given in advance.1 Parameter setting models must overcome a basic problem: the relation between a parameter and what it does is indirect, due to the fact that there are many parameters, and they interact in complex ways (Dresher and Kaye, 1990). For example, in English main stress is tied to the right edge of the word. But that does not mean that stress is always on the last syllable: it could be on the penultimate syllable, as in Manitoba, or on the antepenultimate, as in America. What is consistent in these examples is that main stress devolves onto the strong syllable of the rightmost foot. Where this syllable and foot is in any given word depends on how a variety of parameters are set. Some surprising consequences follow from the nontransparent relationship between a parameter and its effects. The first one is that a learner who</context>

This discrepancy between grammar and outputs defeats learning models that blindly try to match output forms (Gibson and Wexler, 1994), or that are based on a notion of goodness-of-fit (Clark and Roberts, 1993). In terms of Fodor (1998), there are no unambiguous triggers: thus, learning models that seek them in individual target forms are unlikely to be successful. I have argued (Dresher, 1999) that Plato’s solution – a series of questions posed in a specified order – is the best approach we have. One version of this approach is the cue-based learner of (Dresher and Kaye, 1990). In this model, not only are the principles and parameters of Universal Grammar innate, but learners must be born with some kind of a road map that guides them in setting the parameters. Some ingredients of this road map are the following: First, Universal Grammar associates every parameter with a cue, something in the data 43 that signals the learner how that parameter is to be set. The cue might be a pattern that the learner must look for, or simply the presence of some element in a particular context. Second, parameter setting proceeds in a (partial) order set by Universal Grammar: this or</context>

But what about acquisition of the phonemic inventory of a language? One might suppose that this be achieved prior to the acquisition of the phonology itself. Since the pioneering work of Trubetzkoy and Jakobson, phonological theory has posited that phonemes are characterized in terms of a limited set of distinctive features. There2For details of parameter ordering, defaults, and cues in the acquisition of stress, see (Dresher and Kaye, 1990) and (Dresher, 1999). 3 For further discussion and critiques of cue-based models see (Nyberg, 1991), (Gillis Durieux and Daelemans, 1995), (Bertolo et al. 1997), and (Tesar, 2004). fore, to identify a phoneme one must be able to assign to it a representation in terms of feature specifications. What are these representations? Since Saussure, it has been a central assumption of much linguistic theory that a unit is defined not only in terms of its substance, but also in negative terms, with respect to the units it contrasts with.

We have observed that in Classical Manchu, /a/ is the [+ATR] counterpart of /a/. Both vowels are [+low]. Since [low] is ordered first among the vowel features in the Manchu hierarchy, we might suppose that learners determine which vowels are [+low] and which are not at an early stage in the process, before assigning the other features. However, a vowel that is phonetically [a] is ambiguous as to its featural classification. In many languages, including descendants of Classical Manchu (Zhang, 1996, Dresher &amp; Zhang, 2003) such vowels are classified as [–low]. What helps to place /a/ as a [+low] vowel in Classical Manchu is the knowledge that it is the [+ATR] counterpart of /a/. That is, in order to assign the feature [+low] to /a/, it helps to know that it is [+ATR]. But, by hypothesis, [low] is assigned before [ATR]. Similarly, the determination that /i/ is contrastively [+coronal] is tied in with its not being contrastively [–labial]; but [coronal] is assigned prior to [labial]. It appears, then, that whatever order we choose to assign features, it is necessary to have some advance knowledge about classifica</context>

Clark 1989, 1992, who calls this the Selection Problem): a learner cannot reliably assign credit or blame to individual parameters when something is wrong. There is a second way in which parameters can pose problems to a learner. Some parameters are stated in terms of abstract entities and theory-internal concepts that the learner may not initially be able to identify. For example, the theory of stress is couched in 1For some other approaches to the acquisition of stress see (Daelemans Gillis and Durieux, 1994), (Gupta and Touretzky, 1994), (Tesar, 1998, 2004), and (Tesar and Smolensky, 1998). terms of concepts such as heavy syllables, heads, feet, and so on. In syntax, various parameters have been posited that refer specifically to anaphors, or to functional projections of various types. These entities do not come labelled as such in the input, but must themselves be constructed by the learner.

Some ingredients of this road map are the following: First, Universal Grammar associates every parameter with a cue, something in the data 43 that signals the learner how that parameter is to be set. The cue might be a pattern that the learner must look for, or simply the presence of some element in a particular context. Second, parameter setting proceeds in a (partial) order set by Universal Grammar: this ordering specifies a learning path (Lightfoot 1989). The setting of a parameter later on the learning path depends on the results of earlier ones. Hence, cues can become increasingly abstract and grammar-internal the further along the learning path they are. As learners acquire more of the system, their representations become more sophisticated, and they are able to build on what they have already learned to set more parameters.2 If this approach is correct, there is no parameter-independent learning algorithm. This is because the learning path is dependent on the particular parameters. Also, the cues must be discovered for each parameter. Thu</context>

These extracted phonetic features would then constitute phonological representations (surface, or phonetic, representations). Once these are acquired, they can serve as a basis from which learners can acquire the rest of the grammar, namely, the phonological rules (and/or constraints) and the lexical, or underlying, representations. This idea of acquisition by stages, with representations preceding rules, has enduring appeal, though details vary with the prevailing theory of grammar; versions of this theory can be found in (Bloch, 1941) and (Pinker, 1994:264–5). The idea could not be implemented in American Structuralist phonology, however (Chomsky, 1964), and I will argue that it remains untenable today. I will discuss two areas of phonology in which representations must be acquired together with the grammar, rather than prior to it. The first concerns the grammar of stress, or metrical phonology. The second concerns the acquisition of phonological features. These pose different sorts of problems for learning models. The first has been the subject of considerable discussion. The second, to my knowledge, has not been discussed in the context </context>

One might suppose that this be achieved prior to the acquisition of the phonology itself. Since the pioneering work of Trubetzkoy and Jakobson, phonological theory has posited that phonemes are characterized in terms of a limited set of distinctive features. There2For details of parameter ordering, defaults, and cues in the acquisition of stress, see (Dresher and Kaye, 1990) and (Dresher, 1999). 3 For further discussion and critiques of cue-based models see (Nyberg, 1991), (Gillis Durieux and Daelemans, 1995), (Bertolo et al. 1997), and (Tesar, 2004). fore, to identify a phoneme one must be able to assign to it a representation in terms of feature specifications. What are these representations? Since Saussure, it has been a central assumption of much linguistic theory that a unit is defined not only in terms of its substance, but also in negative terms, with respect to the units it contrasts with. On this way of thinking, an /i/ that is part of a threevowel system /i a u/ is not necessarily the same thing as an /i/ that is part of a sevenvowel system /i i e a o u u/.

This can be called the Epistemological Problem: in this case we know about something in the abstract, but we do not recognize that thing when it is front of us. Because of the Credit Problem and the Epistemological Problem, parameter setting is not like learning to hit a target, where one can correct one’s aim by observing where previous shots land. The relation between number of parameters correct and apparent closeness to the target is not smooth (Turkel, 1996): one parameter wrong may result in forms that appear to be way off the target, whereas many parameters wrong may produce results that appear to be better (Dresher, 1999). This discrepancy between grammar and outputs defeats learning models that blindly try to match output forms (Gibson and Wexler, 1994), or that are based on a notion of goodness-of-fit (Clark and Roberts, 1993). In terms of Fodor (1998), there are no unambiguous triggers: thus, learning models that seek them in individual target forms are unlikely to be successful. I have argued (Dresher, 1999) that Plato’s solution – a serie</context>

Some expand the obstruent branch first, bringing in marked fricatives, /F/, in contrast with plosives. Others expand the sonorant branch, introducing marked sonorants, which may be either liquids, /L/, or glides, /J/. Continuing in this way we will eventually have a tree that gives all and only the contrasting features in the language. 5. Acquiring segmental representations Let us consider how such representations might be acquired. To illustrate, we will look at the vowel system of Classical Manchu (Zhang, 1996), which nicely illustrates the types of problems a learning model will have to overcome. Zhang (1996) proposes the contrastive hierarchy in (4) for Classical Manchu, where the order of the features is [low]&gt; [coronal]&gt;[labial]&gt;[ATR].

We have observed that in Classical Manchu, /a/ is the [+ATR] counterpart of /a/. Both vowels are [+low]. Since [low] is ordered first among the vowel features in the Manchu hierarchy, we might suppose that learners determine which vowels are [+low] and which are not at an early stage in the process, before assigning the other features. However, a vowel that is phonetically [a] is ambiguous as to its featural classification. In many languages, including descendants of Classical Manchu (Zhang, 1996, Dresher &amp; Zhang, 2003) such vowels are classified as [–low]. What helps to place /a/ as a [+low] vowel in Classical Manchu is the knowledge that it is the [+ATR] counterpart of /a/. That is, in order to assign the feature [+low] to /a/, it helps to know that it is [+ATR]. But, by hypothesis, [low] is assigned before [ATR]. Similarly, the determination that /i/ is contrastively [+coronal] is tied in with its not being contrastively [–labial]; but [coronal] is assigned prior to [labial]. It appears, then, that whatever order we choose to assign features, it is necessary to have some advance kn</context>
