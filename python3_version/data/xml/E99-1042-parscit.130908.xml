1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998494367346938">
Automatic text simplification for language-
impaired readers is a relatively unexplored area
in natural language processing. We describe a
generic system for text simplification (currently
at the prototype stage) incorporating a range of
state-of-the-art language processing tools. We are
applying the system to help people with apha-
sia (various language impairments, typically oc-
curring as a result of a stroke or head injury) to
understand English newspaper articled.
Aphasic people may encounter many problems
when reading. It has been demonstrated (Devlin,
1999) that these problems can be of a lexical na-
ture since less frequent words are often not readily
available, and also of a syntactic nature in that
particular constructions may pose serious difficul-
ties for understanding. In addition to these gen-
eral aspects of text, there are also problems spe-
cific to newspaper text; for example, the often very
compact summary-like first paragraph in an arti-
cle; long sentences; the use of noun compounds
and long sequences of adjectives; and frequent use
of the passive. Although there is wide variation
in the language problems associated with aphasia,
depending on such factors as locus of brain injury,
aphasia type, and pre-aphasic literacy level, many
aphasic people would benefit from a system of the
sort we describe.
We outline below the processing strategy of the
system and the user-centered evaluation we intend
to carry out. We envisage that the results of this
project will be of use not only to aphasic individ-
uals, but also to other groups such as non-native
speakers whose comprehension of written English
text is restricted by limited foreign language skills.
This work is being carried out on the project
`PSET: Practical Simplification of English Text&apos;
funded by the UK EPSRC (refs GR/L53175
and GR/L53175). The first author is sup-
ported by an EPSRC Advanced Fellowship.

2 The System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999450456790124">
We download the original newspaper articles auto-
matically from the WWW2, and apply a number
of processing stages sequentially.
Lexical Tagger The tagger (Elworthy, 1994)
assigns and ranks part-of-speech (PoS) tags for
each word in a sentence using a first-order HMM.
The tagger includes an unknown word guesser
with an accuracy of around 85%, and a large disk-
resident lexicon specialised to newspaper text.
Morphological Analyser The morphological
analyser (an enhanced version of the GATE
project lemmatiser (Cunningham et al., 1996)) is
based on finite state techniques, and performs an
accurate and efficient inflectional analysis of the
words in a text given the PoS assignment made
by the tagger.
Parser The parser uses a robust feature-based
unification grammar of PoS and punctuation
tags (Briscoe and Carroll, 1995), coupled with
probabilistic LR disambiguation (Carroll and
Briscoe, 1996), assigning the most plausible `shal-
low&apos; phrase structure analysis to the PoS network
(lattice) returned by the tagger. Coverage of a
substantial corpus of general text is around 80%.
We will improve coverage by utilising recent gram-
mar learning techniques (Osborne, Submitted) to
dynamically improve coverage in a principled and
tractable manner.
Anaphor Resolver The anaphor resolution
component (the only stage not as yet implemented
in any form) will be based on CogNIAC (Baldwin,
1997), but rewritten to take advantage of the pre-
ceding processing.
Syntactic Simplifier Aphasic people may have
problems with syntactic constructions that de-
viate from canonical subject-verb-object order.
2 We are using a local newspaper in the north-east
of England, The Sunderland Echo, that is also pub-
lished online.
Thus, passive sentences such as The scheme was
singled out by a recent Government report are
found difficult&apos;, despite the presence of the syn-
tactic cues was, -ed and by. We therefore replace
passive constructions with corresponding active
forms. We are currently integrating further rules
to split conjoined sentences and extract embedded
clauses. Syntactic simplification operates itera-
tively until a configuration is reached that cannot
be simplified. This approach is broadly similar to
that proposed by (Chandrasekar et al., 1996).
One of the many challenges in syntactic simplifi-
cation is the observed effect of the total length of a
text being increased when longer sentences are re-
placed by multiple shorter ones. Also, the removal
of cohesive devices such as conjunctions may re-
sult in anaphora crossing sentence boundaries. To
maintain text coherence and cohesion (Grodzin-
sky et al., 1993 an anaphor is replaced by its ref-
erent if the containing sentence is split.
Lexical Simplifier The lexical simplifier
(based on (Devlin, 1999; Devlin and Tait, 1998))
replaces content words with simpler synonyms.
It first retrieves a set of synonyms for each word
from WordNet (Miller et al., 1993, then, accord-
ing to the user&apos;s desired level of simplification, the
original word plus a percentage of the synonym
list are looked up in the Oxford Psycholinguistic
Database (Quinlan, 1992) for the corresponding
Kucera-Francis frequencies. The word with the
highest frequency is selected.
Morphological Generator Simplification
works on the inflectionally analysed text, so
the last stage is morphological generation. The
generator is simply an inverted version of the
morphological analyser described above. The
inversion is performed automatically (Minnen and
Carroll, Submitted), so any improvements made
to the analyser are reflected in the generator at
no extra cost. Finally, inter-word spelling changes
(e.g. a apple --+ an apple), auxiliary reduction,
etc. are performed.

We will perform an experimental evaluation of the
system with the help of aphasic participants who
are matched to the extent that none display visu-
ally related reading difficulties, which would con-
found the results, and all possess a sufficiently
high reading ability determined at the time of
the experiment by using an aphasia assessment
battery. As the system is a general tool aimed at

was kissed by the girl are even more difficult, since
either noun phrase could be the subject.
all aphasics, the participants will not be screened
for aphasia type. The readability of the simpli-
fied text and the usability of the system will be
assessed by observation and interview; questions
will be posed to gauge subjects&apos; comprehension of
both explicit and implicit material.

Also, the removal of cohesive devices such as conjunctions may result in anaphora crossing sentence boundaries. To maintain text coherence and cohesion (Grodzinsky et al., 1993 an anaphor is replaced by its referent if the containing sentence is split. Lexical Simplifier The lexical simplifier (based on (Devlin, 1999; Devlin and Tait, 1998)) replaces content words with simpler synonyms. It first retrieves a set of synonyms for each word from WordNet (Miller et al., 1993, then, according to the user&apos;s desired level of simplification, the original word plus a percentage of the synonym list are looked up in the Oxford Psycholinguistic Database (Quinlan, 1992) for the corresponding Kucera-Francis frequencies. The word with the highest frequency is selected. Morphological Generator Simplification works on the inflectionally analysed text, so the last stage is morphological generation. The generator is simply an inverted version of the morphological analyser described above. The inversion is performed automatically (Minnen and Carroll, Submitted), so any improveme</context>
