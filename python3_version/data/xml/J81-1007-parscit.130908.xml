Computer Modeling of Linguistic Theory:
An Announcement and a Call for Papers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99937016">
The ACL is sponsoring three sessions on
&amp;quot;Computer Modeling of Linguistic Theory&amp;quot; in con-
junction with the Annual Meeting of the Linguistic
Society of America which will be held in New York
City at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, December 28-30,
1981.
The specific objective is to address a number of
ideas — some old, some new — that have been gain-
ing the attention of both theoretical and computational
linguists alike. These ideas include new models for
grammars and new strategies for parsing, motivated by
the goal of relating grammatical competence and per-
formance in a principled way. People from both lin-
guistics and computational linguistics are becoming
conversant with augmented transition networks, lexical
functional grammars, phrase structure grammars, Mo-
ntague grammars, and transformational grammars, and
beginning to explore their implications for each other.
To further this dialogue, the ACL, with the cooper-
ation of the LSA, is soliciting two sessions of contrib-
uted papers and planning a panel session on the com-
puter modeling of linguistic theory. To submit a paper
for consideration in the contributed paper sessions,
send abstracts of two to eight pages by August 21 to
either:

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99959947826087">
The AISB School on Artificial Intelligence Skills
will be held in Milton Keynes, September 21-25, 1981.
This Autumn school is designed for both industrial and
academic participants. Industrial participants will have
the opportunity to acquire the skills associated with
applying AT techniques to real world-problems. Aca-
demic research scientists will be able to learn about
recent Al developments and enhance their program-
ming and communication skills. The school will have
places for 55 residential participants and will provide
lectures, tutorials, workshops and 24-hour access to
computing facilities.
Lecture topics will include computer vision, compu-
tational linguistics, expert systems, robotics, Al pro-
gramming languages, hardware for Al, and psychologi-
cal modelling. Late-night programming classes will be
conducted for novices with little or no programming
experience, and experts who wish to extend their LISP
or PROLOG skills. There will be a set of workshops
for industrial participants focussing on case studies of
AT applications. A parallel series of workshops on
research methods will cover experimental design, paper
and thesis writing, and seminar presentation skills.

NATO Symposium on Artificial

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938897142857143">
A Symposium on Artificial and Human Intelligence,
sponsored by the Human Factors Subcommittee of
NATO, will be held at the Chateau de Chapeau Cornu
near Lyon, France, October 26-30, 1981. The two
major topic areas to be addressed are: (1) the struc-
ture of memory, the representation of the problem,
and the knowledge and belief base available to the
problem-solver — key issues in both human and ma-
chine intelligence; and (2) the structure of language
and the role that languages play in problem solving.
Other areas of interest include inductive, deductive,
and analog thinking, roles in research of expert sys-
tems, benchmarks and yardstick problems, constraints
of complexity and computability, and priorities in Al
research.

M.Phil. and M.Sc./M.A. degrees by dissertation. Stu-
dents will be attached to the Centre and registered in
the department of their choice. Study will be by su-
pervised research, but students may be required to
attend courses in relevant aspects of Cognitive Science
during their initial year of study.
Alternatively, graduates preferring a taught M.Sc.
with a smaller dissertation may be attached to the
Centre and admitted to the Cognitive Studies option
of the M.Sc. Computer Studies scheme offered by the
Department of Computer Science.
All students have access to the University&apos;s excel-
lent computing facilities based upon a DEC System-

This paper sketches the structure of the TQA sys-
tem with some examples, discusses some of the results
of running the system in a user site during the year
1978, and outlines a few of the implications of a natu-
ral language query system for larger and more diverse
data bases. It is apparent that a number of problems
remain to be solved, but it also seems likely that a
useful system can be constructed for some domains.

This paper addresses the problem of designing an
intelligent office system to help principals (managerial,
administrative, or professional level office workers)
with their work. A system is described which would
use normative models of semi-routine office proce-
dures to anticipate the user&apos;s next steps, to provide
him automatically with files, documents, and forms he
needs to complete a task, and to perform automated
subtasks at the correct times. A number of intelligent
functions that would perform some of the tasks secre-
taries generally do (scheduling, reminding, filing) are
described, along with the knowledge necessary for
performing those functions. In addition, an approach
to building a more intelligent system which would
understand natural language commands given by the
user and understand and deal with routine mail is pres-
ented.

It is apparent that a number of problems remain to be solved, but it also seems likely that a useful system can be constructed for some domains.</abstract>

A system is described which would use normative models of semi-routine office procedures to anticipate the user&apos;s next steps, to provide him automatically with files, documents, and forms he needs to complete a task, and to perform automated subtasks at the correct times. A number of intelligent functions that would perform some of the tasks secretaries generally do (scheduling, reminding, filing) are described, along with the knowledge necessary for performing those functions. In addition, an approach to building a more intelligent system which would understand natural language commands given by the user and understand and deal with routine mail is presented.</abstract>
