1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997764">
The last several years have seen a number of feature-
based systems for pronoun interpretation in which
the feature weights are determined via manual exper-
imentation or supervised learning (see Mitkov (2002)
for a useful survey). Reliable estimation of the
weights in both paradigms requires a substantial
manually-annotated corpus of examples. In this
short paper we describe a system for (third-person)
pronoun interpretation that is self-trained from raw
data, that is, using no annotated training data what-
soever. The result outperforms a Hobbsian baseline
algorithm and is only marginally inferior (2.3%) to
an essentially identical, state-of-the-art supervised
model trained from a manually-annotated corefer-
ence corpus. This result leaves open the possibil-
ity that systems self-trained on very large datasets
with more finely-grained features could eventually
outperform supervised models that rely on manually-
annotated datasets.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. We first briefly describe the supervised system
(described in more detail in Kehler et al. (2004)) to
which we will compare the self-trained system. Both
systems use the same learning algorithm and feature
set; they differ with respect to whether the data they

rithm itself. We then describe our Hobbsian baseline
algorithm, and present the results of all three sys-
tems.

2 The Supervised Algorithm
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952038961039">
The supervised model was trained using the im-
proved iterative scaling algorithm for Maximum
Entropy (MaxEnt) models described by Berger et
al. (1996) with binary-valued features. As is stan-
dard, the model was trained as a binary coreference
classifier: for each possible antecedent of each pro-
noun, a training instance was created that consisted
of the pronoun, the possible antecedent phrase, and
a binary coreference outcome. (Such a model can
be seen as providing a probabilistic measure of an-
tecedent salience.) Because we are ultimately inter-
ested in identifying the correct antecedent among a
set of possible ones, during testing the antecedent
assigned the highest probability is chosen.
The algorithm receives as input the results of SRI’s
TEXTPRO system, a shallow parser that recognizes
low-level constituents (noun groups, verb groups,
etc.). No difficult syntactic attachments are at-
tempted, and the results are errorful. There was no
human-annotated linguistic information in the input.
The training corpus consists of 2773 annotated
third-person pronouns from the newspaper and
newswire segments of the Automatic Content Ex-
traction (ACE) program training corpus. The an-
notated blind corpus used for evaluation consists of
762 annotated third-person pronouns from the ACE
February 2002 evaluation set. The annotated pro-
nouns in both sets include only those that are ACE
“markables”, i.e., ones that refer to entities of the fol-
lowing types: PERSONS, ORGANIZATIONS, GEOPO-
LITICALENTITIES (politically defined geographical
regions, their governments, or their people), LOCA-
TIONS, and FACILITIES.
The system employs a set of HARD CONSTRAINTS
and SOFT FEATURES. The hard constraints filter out
those noun groups that fail conservative number and
gender agreement checks before training, whereas the
soft features are used by the MaxEnt algorithm. A
set of forty soft features were developed and opti-
mized manually; they fall into five categories that
have become fairly standard in the literature:
Gender Agreement: Includes features to test a
strict match of gender (e.g., a masculine pro-
noun and a masculine antecedent), as well as
mere compatibility (e.g., a masculine pronoun
with an antecedent of unknown gender). These
features are more liberal than the gender-based
hard constraint mentioned above.
Number Agreement: Includes features to test a
strict match of number (e.g., a singular pronoun
and a singular antecedent), as well as mere com-
patibility (e.g., a singular pronoun with an an-
tecedent of unknown number). These features
are likewise more liberal than the number-based
hard constraint mentioned above.
Distance: Includes features pertaining to the dis-
tance between the pronoun and the potential an-
tecedent. Examples include the number of sen-
tences between them and the “Hobbs distance”,
that is, the number of noun groups that have
to be skipped before the potential antecedent is
found per the search order used by the Hobbs
algorithm (Hobbs, 1978; Ge et al., 1998).
Grammatical Role: Includes features pertaining
to the syntactic position of the potential an-
tecedent. Examples include whether the poten-
tial antecedent appears to be the subject or ob-
ject of a verb, and whether the potential an-
tecedent is embedded in a prepositional phrase.
Linguistic Form: Includes features pertaining to
the referential form of the potential antecedent,
e.g., whether it is a proper name, definite de-
scription, indefinite NP, or a pronoun.
The values of these features – computed from
TExTPRo’s errorful shallow constituent parses –
comprised the input to the learning algorithm, along
with the outcome as indicated by the annotated key.

3 The Self-Trained Algorithm
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913">
The self-trained algorithm likewise uses MaxEnt,
with the same feature set and shallow parser. The
two systems differ in the training data utilized.
Instead of the training corpus of 2773 annotated
pronouns used in the supervised experiments, the
self-trained algorithm creates training data from
pronouns found in a raw corpus, particularly the
newswire segment of the Topic Detection and Track-
ing (TDT-2) corpus. The system was evaluated on
the same annotated set of 762 pronouns as the su-
pervised system; the performance statistics reported
herein are from the only time an evaluation with this
data was carried out.
The self-trained system embeds the MaxEnt algo-
rithm in an iterative loop during which the training
examples are acquired. The first phase of the algo-
rithm builds an initial model as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997188466666667">
1. For each third-person pronoun:
(a) Collect possible antecedents, that is, all of
the noun groups found in the previous two
sentences and to the left of the pronoun in
the current sentence.
(b) Filter them by applying the hard con-
straints.
(c) If only one possible antecedent remains,
create a pronoun-antecedent pair and label
the coreference outcome as True.
(d) Otherwise, with some probability (0.2
in our experiments&apos;), create a pronoun-
antecedent pair for each possible antecedent
and label the coreference outcome as False.
2. Train a MaxEnt classifier on this training data.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999575">
The simplification assumed above – that corefer-
ence holds for all and only those pronouns for which
TExTPRo and hard constraints find a single possi-
ble antecedent – is obviously false, but it nonetheless
yields a model to seed the iterative part of the algo-
rithm, which goes as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8980376">
3. For each pronoun in the training data acquired
in step 1:
(a) Apply the current MaxEnt model to each
pronoun-antecedent pair.
(b) Label the pair to which the model assigns
the highest probability the coreference out-
come of True. Label all other pairs (if any)
for that pronoun the outcome of False.
4. Retrain the MaxEnt model with this new train-
ing data.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the training data
reaches a steady state, that is, there are no
pronouns for which the current model changes
its preference to a different potential antecedent
than it favored during the previous iteration.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995219">
&apos;This choice will be explained in Section 5.
The hope is that improved predictions about which
potential antecedents of ambiguous pronouns are cor-
rect will yield iteratively better models (note that the
“unambiguous” pronoun-antecedent pairs collected
in step 1c will be considered to be correct through-
out). This hope is notwithstanding the fact that the
algorithm is based on a simplifying assumption – that
each pronoun is associated with exactly one correct
antecedent – that is clearly false for a variety of rea-
sons: (i) there will be cases in which there is more
than one coreferential antecedent in the search win-
dow, all but one of which will get labeled as not coref-
erential during any given iteration, (ii) there will be
cases in which the (perhaps only) correct antecedent
was misparsed or incorrectly weeded out by hard con-
straints, and thus not seen by the learning algorithm
(presumably some of the “unambiguous” cases iden-
tified in step 1c will be incorrect because of this),
and (iii) some of the pronouns found will not even be
referential, e.g. pleonastic pronouns. The empirical
question remains, however, of how good of a system
can be trained under such an assumption. After all,
the model probabilities need not necessarily be accu-
rate in an absolute sense, but only in a relative one:
that is, good enough so that the antecedent assigned
the highest probability tends to be correct.

For comparison purposes, we also implemented a ver-
sion of Hobbs’s (1978) well-known pronoun interpre-
tation algorithm, in which no machine learning is
involved. This algorithm takes the syntactic repre-
sentations of the sentences up to and including the
current sentence as input, and performs a search for
an antecedent noun phrase on these trees. Since
TExTPRo does not build full syntactic trees for the
input, we developed a version that does a simple
search through the list of noun groups recognized.
In accordance with Hobbs’s search procedure, noun
groups are searched in the following order: (i) in the
current sentence from right-to-left, starting with the
first noun group to the left of the pronoun, (ii) in the
previous sentence from left-to-right, (iii) in two sen-
tences prior from left-to-right, (iv) in the current sen-
tence from left-to-right, starting with the first noun
group to the right of the pronoun (for cataphora).
The first noun group encountered that agrees with
the pronoun with respect to number, gender, and
person is chosen as the antecedent.

5 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985958333333">
Reporting on the results of a self-trained system
means only evaluating the system against annotated
data once, since any system reconfiguration and re-
evaluation based on the feedback received would con-
stitute a form of indirectly supervised training. Thus
we had to select a configuration as representing our
“reportable” system before doing any evaluation. To
allow for the closest comparison with our supervised
system, we opted to train the system with the same
number of pronouns that we had in our supervised
training set (2773), and sought to have approxi-
mately the same ratio of positive to negative training
instances, which meant randomly including one-fifth
of the pronouns in the raw data that had more than
one possible antecedent (see step 1d). Later we re-
port on post-hoc experiments to assess the effect of
training data size on performance.
The self-trained system was trained fourteen
times, once using each of fourteen different segments
of the TDT-2 data that we had arbitrarily appor-
tioned at the inception of the project. The scores
reported below and in Table 1 for the self-trained
system are averages of the fourteen corresponding
evaluations. The final results are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999959">
• Hobbs Baseline: 68.8%
• Self-Trained: 73.4%
• Supervised: 75.7%
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.81494105">
The self-trained system beats the competitive Hobbs
baseline system by 4.6% and comes within 2.3% of
the supervised system trained on the same number
of manually-annotated pronouns.2
Convergence for the self-trained system was fairly
rapid, taking between 8 and 14 iterations. The num-
ber of changes in the current model’s predictions
started off relatively high in early iterations (aver-
aging approximately 305 pronouns or 11% of the
dataset) and then steadily declined (usually, but not
always, monotonically) until convergence. Post-hoc
2All results are reported here in terms of accuracy,
that is, the number of pronouns correctly resolved divided
by the total number of pronouns read in from the key. An
antecedent is considered correct if the ACE keys place the
pronoun and antecedent in the same coreference class.
In the case of 64 of the 762 pronouns in the evaluation
set, none of the antecedents input to the learning algo-
rithms were coreferential. Thus, 91.6% accuracy is the
best that these algorithms could have achieved.

In Kehler et al. (2004) we describe two ways in which
our supervised system was augmented to use predicate-
argument frequencies, one which used them in a post-
processor and another which modeled them with features
alongside our morphosyntactic ones. In our self-trained
system, the first of these methods improved performance
to 75.1% (compared to 76.8% for the supervised system)
and the second to 74.1% (compared to 75.7% for the su-

analysis showed that the iterative phase contributed
a gradual (although again not completely monotonic)
improvement in performance during the course of
learning.
We then performed a set of post-hoc experiments
to measure the effect of training data size on perfor-
mance for the self-trained system. The results are
given in Table 1, which show a gradual increase in
performance as the number of pronouns grows. The
final row includes the results when all of the “un-
ambiguous” pronouns in each TDT segment are uti-
lized (again, along with approximately one-fifth of
the ambiguous pronouns), which amounted to be-
tween 7,212 and 11,245 total pronouns.3 (Note that
since most pronouns have more than one possible
antecedent, the number of pronoun-antecedent train-
ing examples fed to MaxEnt is considerably higher
than the numbers of pronouns shown in the table.)
Perhaps one of the more striking facts is how well
the algorithm performs with relatively few pronouns,
which suggests that the generality of the features
used allow for fairly reliable estimation without much
data.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9787024">
To conclude, a pronoun interpretation system can
be trained solely on raw data using a standard set
of morphosyntactic features to achieve performance
that approaches that of a state-of-the-art supervised
system. Although the self-acquired training data is
no doubt highly noisy, the resulting model is still
accurate enough to perform well at selecting correct
antecedents. As a next step, we will take a closer
look at the training data acquired to try to ascertain
3TDT segment 14, which is smaller than the others,
provided only about 3800 pronouns in the runs corre-
sponding to the last two rows of Table 1. The overall
average performance figures are the same to the first dec-
imal place whether or not the results from this segment
are included.
the underlying reasons for this success.
There are also a number of variants of the algo-
rithm that could be pursued. For instance, whereas
our algorithm uses the current model’s probabilities
in a winner-take-all strategy for positive example se-
lection, these probabilities could instead be used to
dictate the likelihood that examples are assigned a
positive outcome, or they could be thresholded in
various ways to create a more discerning positive out-
come assignment mechanism. Such strategies would
avoid the current simplification of assigning a posi-
tive outcome to exactly one potential antecedent for
each pronoun.
The relative generality of our feature set was ap-
propriate given the size of the data sets used. The
availability of very large raw corpora, however, cre-
ates the prospect of using self-training with consider-
ably more fine-grained features than is possible in a
supervised scenario, due to the relative infrequency
with which they would be found in any corpus of a
size that could be feasibly annotated manually. It
is thus at least conceivable that a self-trained ap-
proach, coupled with a large set of features and a
large corpus of raw data, could eventually overtake
the performance of the best supervised models.

The result outperforms a Hobbsian baseline algorithm and is only marginally inferior to an essentially identical, state-of-the-art supervised model trained from a substantial manually-annotated coreference corpus. 1 Introduction The last several years have seen a number of featurebased systems for pronoun interpretation in which the feature weights are determined via manual experimentation or supervised learning (see Mitkov (2002) for a useful survey). Reliable estimation of the weights in both paradigms requires a substantial manually-annotated corpus of examples. In this short paper we describe a system for (third-person) pronoun interpretation that is self-trained from raw data, that is, using no annotated training data whatsoever. The result outperforms a Hobbsian baseline algorithm and is only marginally inferior (2.3%) to an essentially identical, state-of-the-art supervised model trained from a manually-annotated coreference corpus. This result leaves open the possibility that systems self-trained on very large </context>
