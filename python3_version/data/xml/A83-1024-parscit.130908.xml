The work that I Intend to present here is a
preliminary study concerning the automatic trans-
lation of French natural language statements into
the RESEDA semantic language.
The RESEDA project itself is concerned with
the creation and practical exploitation of a system
for managing a biographical database using Arti-
ficial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The term
&amp;quot;biographical data&amp;quot; must be understood in its
widest possible sense : being in fact any event, in
the public or private life, physical or intellectual,
etc., that it is possible to gather about the
personages we are interested in. In the present
state of the system, this information concerns a
well-defined period in time (approximately between
1350 and 1450) and a particular subject area
(French history), but we are now working on the
adaptation of RESEDA&apos;s methodology to the process-
ing of other biographical data, for example medical
or legal data.
RESEDA differs from &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; factual data-
base management systems in two ways:
- The information is recorded in the base using a
particular Data Definition Language (metalan-
guage) which uses knowledge representation
techniques.
- A user interrogating the base obtains not only
information which has been directly introduced
This research is jointly financed by the &amp;quot;Agence
de l&apos;Informatique - A.D.I.&amp;quot; (CNRS/ADI contract n°
507568) and the &amp;quot;Centre National de la Recherche
Scientifique - C.N.R.S.&amp;quot; (ATP n° 955045).
into it, but also &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; information found using
inference mechanisms particular to the system ;
In this respect, the most important character-
istic of the system lies in the possibility of
using inference procedures to question the data-
base about causal relationships which may exist
between the different recorded facts, and which
are not explicitly declared at the time of data
entry (Earn, 19791981). For example, the
system may try to explain by inference top-level
changes in the State administration in terms of
changes in political power.

The biographical information which consti-
tutes the system&apos;s database is organized in the
form of units called &amp;quot;planes&amp;quot;. There are several
different types of plane, see Earn i et al. (1977);
the &amp;quot;predicative planes&amp;quot;, the most important, cor-
respond to a &amp;quot;flash&amp;quot; which illustrates a particu-
lar moment in the &amp;quot;life story&amp;quot; of one or more per-
sonages. A predicative plane is made up of one of
five possible &amp;quot;predicates&amp;quot; (BE-AFFECTED-BY,
BEHAVE, HE-PRESENT, MOVE, PRODUCE) ; one or more
&amp;quot;modulators&amp;quot; may be attached to each predicate.
The modulator&apos;s function is to specify and
delimit the semantic role of the predicate. Each
predicate is accompanied by &amp;quot;case slots&amp;quot; which in-
troduce their own arguments ; dating and space
location is also given within a predicative plane,
as is the bibliographic authority for the state-
ment. Predicative planes can be linked together
in a number of ways ; one way is to use explicit
links of &amp;quot;coordination&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;causality&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;finality&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot;, etc. The data represen-
tation we have chosen in the RESEDA project is
basically, therefore, a kind of &amp;quot;case grammar&amp;quot;,
according to the particular meaning attached to
the term in an AI context (Bruce, 1975; Charniak,
1981; etc.).
For example, the data &amp;quot;Andr6 Marchant was
named provost of Paris by the King&apos;s Council on
22nd September 1413 ;he lost his post on 23rd
October 1414, to the benefit of Tanguy du ChAtel,
who was granted this office&amp;quot;, will be represented
in three planes - that of the nomination of Andre
Merchant, his dismissal and the nomination of
Tanguy du ChAtel.
The coding of information must be made on two
distinct levels : an &amp;quot;external coding, up until

now performed manually by the analyst, gives rise to
a first type of representation, formalized accord-
ing to the categories of the RESEDA metalanguage ;
a second automatic stage results in the &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot;
numeric code. The external &amp;quot;manual&amp;quot; coding of the
three events just stated is given in figure 1. The
code in capital letters indicates a predicate and

its associated &amp;quot;case slots&amp;quot;. Every predicative
plane is characterized by a pair. of &amp;quot;time refer-
ences&amp;quot; (datel-date2) which give the duration of the
episode in question. In these three planes, the
second date slot (date2) is empty because their
modulators (begin, end) specify a change of state
associated with a punctual event. &amp;quot;André-Marchant&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Tanguy-du-Chatel&amp;quot; are historical personages
known to the system ; &amp;quot;provost&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;king&apos;s-council&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;letters-of-nomination&amp;quot; are terms of RESEDA&apos;s
lexicon. The classifications associated with the
terms of the lexicon provide the major part of the
system&apos;s socio-historical knowledge of the period.
&amp;quot;Paris&amp;quot; is the &amp;quot;location of the object&amp;quot;. If the
historical sources analyzed gave us the exact
causes of these events, we would introduce into the
database the corresponding planes and associate
them with these three planes by an explicit link
of type &amp;quot;CAUSE&amp;quot;.
This manual procedure for converting informa-
tion in natural language into one or more planes
has at least two major disadvantages which the
proposed study intends to deal with :
- The manual representation of biographical infor-
mation in the terms of the metalanguage can only
be performed by a specialist. This is done, at
the moment, by the researchers themselves who
have constructed the prototype system. Such a
method is obviously out of the question if the
system is to be used routinely by an uninitiated
public, especially as RESEDA was conceived as a
system supplied continuously with biographical
information extracted from many different sources.
- In spite of the fact that the syntax of RESEDA&apos;s
metalanguage imposes strict constraints on the
forming of predicative schemata accepted by the
system and that these are then thoroughly
checked, we cannot completely exclude the poss-
ibility of two coders translating the same in-
formation differently.
III DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD OF AUTOMATIC CODING
To describe our methodology, I will use the
example given in the preceeding section. The
initial text in natural language is first (pre)
processed to obtain its constituent structure.
For this purpose, we have used in a first approach
the French surface grammar implemented in DEREDEC,
a software package developed at the University of
Québec at Montréal by Pierre Plante (1980a;1980b).
This system, comparable to an ATN parser, permits
a breakdown of the surface text into its syntactic
constituents, and establishes, between these con-
stituents, syntagmatic relationships of the type
&amp;quot;topic-comment&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;determination&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;coordination&amp;quot;.
This preliminary analysis provides a context for
subsequent processing, without necessarily removing
all the ambiguities : in the same vein, see Boguraev
and Sparck Jones (1982).
The specific tools that we intend to develop
for this project are of two types : a general
procedure which can be likened to a sort of sem-
antic parsing, and a system of heuristic rules.
A. semantic Parsing
The first stage of the general procedure
consists of marking the &amp;quot;triggers&amp;quot;, defined as
lexical units which call for one or more of the
predicative patterns allowed for in RESEDA&apos;s meta-
language. Thus we do not take into consideration
every one of the lexical items met in the surface
text, retaining only those directly pertaining to
the &amp;quot;translation&amp;quot; to be done.
However, we do not limit ourselves to a
simple keyword approach, since a number of oper-
ations utilizing data provided by the morpho-
syntactic analysis executed by DEREDEC are necess-
ary before the predicative patterns which will be
actually used afterwards can be selected.
One of the results of the DEREDEC analysis is
a kind of lemmatization enabling the reduction of
surface forms in the text to a canonical form ;
for example, infinitive in the case of verbs. The
canonical forms found in the text under examination
are compared with a list of potential triggers
stored permanently in the system. In the case of
the sentence we are analyzing we can construct
from this list the following sub-list : verbal
forms . &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;loss&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; ; terms pertaining
directly to the metalanguage or terms which have a
direct correspondence with elements of the meta-
language : &amp;quot;office&amp;quot;, synonymous with &amp;quot;East&amp;quot; in
RESEDA (&amp;quot;post&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; term, a &amp;quot;head&amp;quot; of a
&amp;quot;sub-tree&amp;quot; in RESEDA&apos;s lexicon), and its specifi-
cation &amp;quot;provost&amp;quot;. The results of the pre-analysis
executed by DEREDEC enable the elimination of
potential patterns associated with the triggers
&amp;quot;name&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; which would correspond to sur-
face constructions of type &amp;quot;active&amp;quot;, as in the
hypothetical example &amp;quot;The Duke of Orleans named
André Marchant provost of Paris ...&amp;quot;. The patterns
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999667357142857">
which will be actually utilized afterwards are
therefore those shown in figure 2. Note that in
the case of a trigger &amp;quot;name (active form)&amp;quot; the
personage who figures as surface object would have
found as the &amp;quot;SUBJECT&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;BE-AFFECTED-BY&amp;quot;, whilst
the surface subject would have been associated
with the slot &amp;quot;SOURCE&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;BE-AFFECTED-BY&amp;quot;.
the papal court (social body)&amp;quot;. Therefore, for
example, the pattern in figure 3 is also associ-
ated with the trigger &amp;quot;name (passive form)&amp;quot;. The
patterns in this second set will be eliminated at
the end of the construction procedure since, as it
is not possible to obtain a surface realization of
the concept &amp;quot;&lt;social-body&gt;&amp;quot; in the position

In reality, the predicative structures select-
ed are not limited to those shown in figure 1.
They are in fact repeated with predicative patterns
of the type &amp;quot;BE-AFFECTED-BY&amp;quot; which have as &amp;quot;SUBJECT&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;&lt;social-body&gt;&amp;quot;,and as &amp;quot;OBJECT&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;personage&gt;&amp;quot;
accompanied by the specification (&amp;quot;SPECIF&amp;quot;) of a
&amp;quot;&lt;post)&amp;quot;. These constructions each correspond to
the description : &amp;quot;A personage receives a post in
a certain organization (the organization in ques-
tion, SUBJECT, is &amp;quot;augmented&amp;quot;, BE-AFFECTED-BY, by
the personage, OBJECT, in relation, SPECIF, to a
given post)&amp;quot;. A corresponding surface expression
would be, for example, the following : &amp;quot;André
Merchant (personage) is named secretary (post) of
&amp;quot;SUBJECT&amp;quot;, they cannot provide complete predicative
structures.
The last stage of the general procedure
consists of examining the triggers belonging to
the same morpho-syntactic environments, as defined
by the results of the DEREDEC analysis. If there
are several triggers pertaining to the same en-
vironment, and if the predicative patterns trigger-
ed are the same - which means that the predicates
and case slots must be the same and that the
modulators, dates and space location information
must be compatible - then it can be said that the
triggers refer to the same situation. As a

result, the predicative patterns are merged as to
obtain the most complete description possible ;
the predictions about filling the slots linked
with the cases of the resulting patterns together
govern to search for fillers in the surface ex-
pression.
Thus, the first two triggers in figure 2,
recognized as relevant to the same environment,
are combined in the formula in figure 4, which
gives the general framework of plane 1 in figure 1.

usually much more complicated, and require the use
of complex inference rules. / shall say just a
few words here about the heuristic rules designed
to solve cases of anaphora (as in our example,
&amp;quot;he&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;this office&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;who&amp;quot;).

The example we are considering illustrates a
particularly simple case, in which it is not necess-
ary to establish links between the planes to be
created. If we had to process the sentence
&amp;quot;Philibert de St Leger is nominated seneschal of
Lyon on the 30th of July 1412, in lieu of the late
A. de Viry&amp;quot;, three planes should be generated :
one for the nomination of Philibert de St Leger,
one for the death of A. de Viry, and another estab-
lishing a weak causality link (&amp;quot;CONFER&amp;quot;, in our
metalanguage) between the first two planes.
Surface items such as conjunctions, prepositions
and sentential adverbs can be used to infer links
between planes : causality, finality, coordination,
etc. More precisely, in the last example, &amp;quot;in
Lieu of&amp;quot; is a potential trigger according to the
following rule : if the main noun group of the
surface prepositional phrase contains a trigger,
this phrase constitutes a plane environment and
&amp;quot;CONFER&amp;quot; introduces the plane created.
B. Heuristic Rules
The process I have outlined so far requires a
corpus of heuristic rules - organized in the form
of &amp;quot;grammars&amp;quot; associated with the predicative
patterns of RESEDA&apos;s metalanguage - which will
enable the slots in these patterns to be filled
using the surface information in accordance with
the predictions which characterize the slots. In
the case of the pattern in figure 4, this filling-
in poses no real problems, since the surface
In the approach that we propose, marks of
anaphora are identified during the general analysis
procedure ; the actual solving brings into play a
number of criteria from simple pairing off and
morphological agreement to more subtle criteria,
like contextual proximity, persistence of theme,
etc. Thus, morphological agreement and contextual
proximity are used to replace &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;Tanguy du
ChAtel&amp;quot; in our example ; persistence of the theme
enables us to fill in the missing date for Tanguy
du Ch&amp;tel&apos;s posting with the date &amp;quot;23rd October
1414&amp;quot; appearing in the surface expression.
We would like to integrate this approach,
which has been purely empirical up to now, into
the framework of a more general theory. Two
directions of enquiry seem particularly interest-
ing in order to develop our own philosophy of the
subject.
The PAL system of Candace Sidner (1979;1981),
is a top-down anaphora resolution method which
makes use of the notion of focus (likened to the
theme of the discourse). By searching in the
text for &amp;quot;focuses&amp;quot; which refer to a system of
representation organized as a series of &amp;quot;frames&amp;quot;,
it is able to solve references. If the reference
is not found by using the frames themselves, it
is inferred from other frames contained in the
database. The interest in this study lies in the
fact that RESEDA already has, as permanent data,
a certain amount of general knowledge organized
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996477">
146
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99924875">
in a form very similar to that of frames. Thus,
in my example, the nomination and dismissal of
André Merchant refers to the context of the &amp;quot;civil
war at the beginning of the 15th century&amp;quot; which
is one of those frames (Earn i et al., 1977). The
approach used by Klapphol. and Lockman (Lockman,
1978) depends on the hypothesis that there is a
strong link between co-reference and the cohesive
links of a discourse. These links, when marked
progressively in the text, become indices of the
structure of the discourse, organized as a tree
structure and created dynamically. These cohesive
links (effect, cause, syllogism, exemplification,
etc.) are very similar to the logical connections
between planes in RESEDA (causality, finality,
condition, etc.).

TV CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999178">
The study that I have described here is in-
tended to automatically achieve a representation
of fundamental underlying semantic relationships
corresponding to a French surface expression. I
have already pointed out the benefits that we
hope to obtain from this work as far as RESEDA is
concerned. I should like to add that, on a more
general level, solving the problem of automati-
cally recording natural language data would
obsiously allow us to face, with a certain amount
of confidence, the analogous problems of natural
language interrogation of RESEDA&apos;s database the
advantages of this, from the point of view of
widespread use of the system, are obvious. But
the results of this study can, in principle, be
used not only in the framework of RESEDA, but in a
number of different applications such as, for
example, automatic abstraction, paraphrase, machine
translation and the direct coding of natural
language documents in a factual database.
