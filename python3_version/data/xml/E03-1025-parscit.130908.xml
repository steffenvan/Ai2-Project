We use the grammatical re-
lations (GRs) described in
Carroll et al. (1998) to compare
a number of parsing algorithms.
A first ranking of the parsers is
provided by comparing the extracted
GRs to a gold standard GR anno-
tation of 500 Susanne sentences:
this required an implementation of
GR extraction software for Penn
Treebank style parsers. In addition,
we perform an experiment using
the extracted GRs as input to the
Lappin and Leass (1994) anaphora
resolution algorithm. This produces
a second ranking of the parsers, and
we investigate the number of errors
that are caused by the incorrect
GRs.

We investigate the usefulness of a grammatical
relation (GR) evaluation method by using it to
compare the performance of four full parsers
and a GR finder based on a shallow parser.
It is usually difficult to compare perfor-
mance of different style parsers, as the out-
put trees can vary in structure. In this pa-
per, we use GRs to provide a common basis
for comparing full and shallow parsers, and
Penn Treebank and Susanne structures. To
carry out this comparison, we implemented a
GR extraction mechanism for Penn Treebank

parses. Evaluating parsers using GRs as op-
posed to crossing brackets or labelled preci-
sion/recall metrics can be argued to give a
more robust measure of performance (Carroll
et al., 1998), (Clark and Hockenmaier, 2002).
The main novelty of this paper is the use of
the Carroll et al&apos;s GR evaluation method to
compare the Collins model 1 and model 2, and
Charniak parsers.
An initial evaluation is provided by compar-
ing the extracted GRs to a gold standard GR
annotation of 500 Susanne sentences due to
Carroll et al. To gain insight into the strengths
and weaknesses of the different parsers, we
present a breakdown of the results for each
type of GR. It is not clear whether the rank-
ing produced from the gold standard evalu-
ation is representative: there may be corpus
effects for parsers not trained on Susanne,
and real life applications may not reflect this
ranking. We therefore perform an experi-
ment using the extracted GRs as input to the
Lappin and Leass (1994) anaphora resolution
algorithm. This produces a second ranking of
the parsers, and we investigate the number of
errors that are caused by incorrect GRs.
We describe the parsers and the GR finder
in Section 2. We introduce GRs in Section 3
and briefly describe our GR extraction soft-
ware for Penn Treebank style parses. The eval-
uation, including a description of the evalua-
tion corpus and performance results, is pre-
sented in Section 4. The results are analyzed
in Section 5 and a performance comparison in
the context of anaphora resolution is presented
in Section 6. We draw our conclusions in Sec-
tion 7.

In this work we compare four full parsers
from which GRs are extracted by walk-
ing over the trees. These parsers
are Briscoe and Carroll (1993) (BC),
Charniak (2000) (CH), model 1 and model 2
of Collins (1997) (Cl and C2).1- A summary
of published performance results can be found

3 Grammatical Relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9863051">
Lin (1995) proposed an evaluation based on
grammatical dependencies, in which syntac-
tic dependencies are described between heads
and their dependents. This work was extended
by Carroll et al. (1998), and it is this specifi-
cation called grammatical relations which we
employ in our work. An example, for the sen-
tence John gave Mary the book, can be seen in
Figure 1.

Buchholz&apos;s GR finder already output GRs
in the desired format. Although Buchholz&apos;s
work has focused mainly on extracting rela-
tions involving verbs, some non-verb relations
(e.g. detmod) are also produced by the chun-
ker she employs (Veenstra and van den Bosch,
2000).
Therefore, to carry out a GR comparison,
we need to extract GRs from Penn Treebank
style parses. We manually created rules which
find the relevant heads and their dependants
by traversing the parse tree (for example, the
NP in a S NP VP rule gives an instance
of the ncsubj relation). In cases where a dis-
tinction is difficult/impossible to make from a
Penn Treebank tree (e.g. xcomp vs xmod), we
sacrificed recall for precision and only encoded
rules which cause as few misclassifications as
possible.2
Similar work has been carried out by
Blaheta and Charniak (2000) who used statis-
tical methods to add function tags to Penn
Treebank I style parses; however, as well as
converting the tags into a Carroll et al. for-
mat, we would need to add extra rules to ex-
tract other GRs needed for our application de-
scribed in Section 6. E.g. the direct object
is not immediately apparent from Penn Tree-
bank II tags.
We restrict the GRs we extract from the
Penn Treebank to those that are necessary for
the anaphora resolution application (the ob-
ject relations, the complement relations and
the ncmod relation), and those that are a sim-
ple by-product of extracting the necessary re-
lations (e.g. aux).
</bodyText>

rules may be responsible for degraded performance.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956769230769">
As part of the development of their parser,
Carroll et al. have manually annotated 500
sentences with their GRs.3 The sentences
were selected at random from the Susanne cor-
pus subject to the constraint that they are
within the coverage of the Briscoe and Car-
roll parser.4 We used our own evaluation soft-
ware which only scores correct an exact match
of the output with the gold standard. This
has caused some differences in performance
with previously published results, for example
the Briscoe and Carroll GRs do not produce
the expected conjunction in the conj relation,
causing the system to score zero.
The results of all systems are presented in
Table 3. For each system, we present two fig-
ures: precision (the number of instances of this
GR the system correctly annotated divided by
the number of instances labelled as this GR
by the system), and recall (the number of in-
stances of this GR the system correctly anno-
tated divided by the number of instances of
this GR in the corpus). In the #occs column
of the table, we also present the number of oc-
currences of each GR in the 500 sentence cor-
pus. A dash (—) indicates that a certain GR
annotation was not present in the answer cor-
pus at al1.5 We also show the mean it precision
and recall for each system, and the weighted
mean itw, where precision and recall values
are weighted by the number of occurrences of
each GR.
To obtain a ranking of the parsers, we com-
pare F0_1 using the t-test. The 500 sentence
corpus is split into 10 segments and an F-
measure is computed for each algorithm on all
segments. These are then compared using the
t-test. The results are presented in Table 4,
which is to be interpreted as follows:

4The parser has a coverage of about 74% on Su-
sanne.
5Note that we currently do not extract cmod, conj,
csubj, mod, subj, xmod or xsubj from Penn Treebank
parses. We have merged the xcomp, ccomp and clausal
GRs to make the evaluation meaningful (no clausal
tags appear in the gold standard).

We investigated the cases where groups of sys-
tems failed to annotate some GRs (missing
GRs) and cases where groups of systems re-
turned the same wrong relation (extra GRs).
The results of this are presented in Tables 5
and 6. In Table 5, we present the percent-
age of wrong cases covered by a particular
combination of systems (i.e. BC represents the
proportion of extra relations which were only
suggested by the Briscoe and Carroll parser,
whereas BC BU CH Cl C2 represents those ex-
tras which were suggested by all parsers.)6 We
present individual percentages, the percentage
covered by the related Collins parsers (Cl C2),
the Penn Treebank parsers (CH Cl C2) and all
systems. The GRs wrongly suggested by all
systems could be used to identify errors in the
gold standard, since these break down into:

because this anaphora resolution algorithm
can be encoded in terms of the GR information
(Preiss and Briscoe, 2003). For each pronoun,
this algorithm uses syntactic criteria to rule
out noun phrases that cannot possibly corefer
with it. An antecedent is then chosen accord-
ing to a ranking based on salience weights.
For all pronouns, noun phrases are ruled
out if they have incompatible agreement fea-
tures. Pronouns are split into two classes, lexi-
cal (reflexives and reciprocals) and non-lexical
anaphors. There are additional syntactic fil-
ters for both of the two types of anaphors.

Secondly, GR information is used for obtain-

her points for accusative emphasis.
The algorithm makes use of the object rela-

In our error analysis, we found that in 40%
(13) of the errors the anaphora resolution al-
gorithm made a mistake with all the parsers.
This suggests that for a large number of pro-
nouns, the error is with the anaphora resolu-
tion algorithm and not with the parser em-
ployed. The breakdown of the number of sys-
tems that suggested each mistake for each pro-
noun can be seen in Table 11.9

antecedent, since there are no cases where all
versions of the Lappin and Leass algorithm
chose different antecedents (versus 153 times
all systems chose the wrong antecedent). The
number of times that only one antecedent
exists in the suggested answers is strikingly
high. However, this may be slightly mis-
leading, as a chosen pronominal antecedent
(e.g. in Mary... Shei. She2, She2 will resolve
to She&apos;) counts as identical whether or not
it refers to the same entity. In scoring the
anaphora resolution, if Shei was previously
wrongly resolved, She2 is also treated as an
error. This choice of evaluation method may
be having an impact on our overall accuracy.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981791666667">
We have presented two evaluations of infor-
mation derived from full and shallow parsers.
The first compares the results of certain GRs
against a gold standard, and the second inves-
tigates the change in accuracy of an anaphora
resolution system when the parser is varied.
When the systems&apos; F-measures were com-
pared, we found that Buchholz&apos; GR finder out-
performed the conventional full parsers. This
is an interesting result, which shows that ac-
curate GRs can be obtained without the ex-
pense of constructing a full parse. The rank-
ing between the Penn Treebank parsers ob-
tained from the GR evaluation reflects the
ranking obtained from a direct parser compar-
ison (from Table 1).
In the task-based evaluation, the perfor-
mance gap between the anaphora resolution
algorithm using the various parsers narrowed.
This may be due to the anaphora resolution al-
gorithm making use of only certain instances
of GRs which are &apos;equally difficult&apos; for all
parsers to extract.
We expect the results of the anaphora res-

olution experiment to be typical of parser ap-
plications that make use of a large number
of types of GRs. Future work is required to
evaluate parsers on applications that make use
of just a few types of GRs, for example se-
lectional preference based word sense disam-
biguation.

A first ranking of the parsers is provided by comparing the extracted GRs to a gold standard GR annotation of 500 Susanne sentences: this required an implementation of GR extraction software for Penn Treebank style parsers. In addition, we perform an experiment using the extracted GRs as input to the Lappin and Leass (1994) anaphora resolution algorithm. This produces a second ranking of the parsers, and we investigate the number of errors that are caused by the incorrect GRs.</abstract>

An initial evaluation is provided by comparing the extracted GRs to a gold standard GR annotation of 500 Susanne sentences due to Carroll et al. To gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the different parsers, we present a breakdown of the results for each type of GR. It is not clear whether the ranking produced from the gold standard evaluation is representative: there may be corpus effects for parsers not trained on Susanne, and real life applications may not reflect this ranking. We therefore perform an experiment using the extracted GRs as input to the Lappin and Leass (1994) anaphora resolution algorithm. This produces a second ranking of the parsers, and we investigate the number of errors that are caused by incorrect GRs. We describe the parsers and the GR finder in Section 2. We introduce GRs in Section 3 and briefly describe our GR extraction software for Penn Treebank style parses. The evaluation, including a description of the evaluation corpus and performance results, is presented in Section 4. The results are analyzed in Section 5 and a performance comparison in the context of anaphora resolution is presented in Section 6. We draw our conclusions in Secti</context>

This will indicate the impact of a change in parser performance on a real task: although one parser may have a marginally higher precision than another on a particular evaluation corpus, it is not clear whether this will be reflected by the results of a system which makes use of this parser, and which may work on a different corpus. 6.1 Lappin and Leass We choose to re-implement a non-probabilistic algorithm due to Lappin and Leass (1994), 295 because this anaphora resolution algorithm can be encoded in terms of the GR information (Preiss and Briscoe, 2003). For each pronoun, this algorithm uses syntactic criteria to rule out noun phrases that cannot possibly corefer with it. An antecedent is then chosen according to a ranking based on salience weights. For all pronouns, noun phrases are ruled out if they have incompatible agreement features. Pronouns are split into two classes, lexical (reflexives and reciprocals) and non-lexical anaphors. There are additional syntactic filters for both of the two types of anaphors. (ncsubj l</context>

The candidate with the highest salience is proposed as the antecedent. 6.2 Using GR Information The algorithm uses GR information at two points: initially, it is used to eliminate certain intrasentential candidates from the candidates list. For example, in the sentence She likes her, she and her cannot corefer, which is expressed by a shared head in the following GRs: For this experiment, we use an anaphorically resolved 2400 sentence initial segment of the BNC (Leech, 1992), which we split into five segments containing roughly equal numbers of pronouns.
