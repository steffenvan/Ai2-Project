This study represents an exploration of the phenomenon of non-literal language
(&amp;quot;metaphors&amp;quot;) and an approach that lends itself to computational modeling. Ortony&apos;s
theories of the way in which salience and asymmetry function in human metaphor process-
ing are explored and expanded on the basis of numerous examples. A number of factors
appear to be interacting in the metaphor comprehension process. In addition to salience
and asymmetry, of major importance are incongruity, hyperbolicity, inexpressibility,
prototypicality, and probable value range. Central to the model is a knowledge representa-
tion system incorporating these factors and allowing for the manner in which they interact.
A version of KL-ONE (with small revisions) is used for this purpose.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994252631579">
One can hardly fail to notice the flurry of intellectual
activity that currently surrounds the understanding of
the use of figurative language. The interest is multi-
disciplinary — linguistics, psychology, philosophy, edu-
cation, to name a few of the more active disciplines.
The reason, which anyone writing on the subject has-
tens to point out, is that the observation of natural
speech demonstrates clearly that it is rarely confined
to the strictly literal. Figurative language is not mere-
ly an ornament of the poet but abounds in the every-
day speech of everyday people and as such is a legiti-
mate area of inquiry for researchers — in any discipline
— who are concerned with understanding natural lan-
guage. The interest in metaphor in computer under-
standing of natural languages stems from this same
source. It is well understood that people, when con-
versing with machines, can no more be constrained to
literal language than they can be expected to be long
contented, within the confines of a synthetic language.

2. Scope of the Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998613807692308">
The heading &amp;quot;figurative language&amp;quot; comprises the tradi-
tional figures of speech know as synechdoche, metony-
my, hyperbole, personification, irony, etc., as well as
the more common metaphor and simile I am going to
focus here on these latter two in order to narrow my
view in the hope of achieving some depth and also
because of a belief that the other figures may operate
under similar principles. Except where noted, I will
use the term &amp;quot;metaphor&amp;quot; in referring to both similes
and metaphors. Please note that this does not imply
that I am taking the position that metaphors and sim-
iles are the same; in fact, there is some evidence that
they function differently from one another. At the
least, it seems possible that the distinction between
these two is more than the traditional one of implicit-
ness versus explicitness since there are instances of
metaphors that sound strange when &amp;quot;transformed&amp;quot;
into similes and vice versa. I therefore am using the
term &amp;quot;metaphor&amp;quot; in a very loose way to cover the area
metaphors and similes have in common (for example,
the similarity in the figurative reads of John is an
animal and John is like an animal), without pausing at
this time to delve into its exact nature and ignoring for
the moment the apparent differences.
To start, I will work only with isolated sentences of
the form

<bodyText confidence="0.996981428571429">

(2) Billboards are like warts
then, the topic is billboards, the vehicle warts and the
ground ugliness and (perhaps) prominence.
In restricting this study to sentences of the form
(1), my motives here again are to constrain the un-
wieldiness of the subject. Of course this rules out a
large body of possible metaphorical utterances of other
forms. Many of these, however, if confined to one
sentence, could be restated in the form of (1) with no
significant loss of meaning. I will not discuss them
here. I will, however, have something to say later
about the larger linguistic context (discourse.)
The typed word, the presumed form of input of
natural language to a computer until such time as actu-
al speech understanding systems develop sufficiently,
imposes limitations of its own on the scope of any
language processing system. The most obvious is, of
course, that variation in intonation of the input is lim-
ited to its most &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; pattern; prosodic features
must largely be ignored. (A certain amount of empha-
sis or contrastive stress may be obtained by underlin-
ing, but the study of this should be considered sepa-
rately.) Another, perhaps more relevant consideration,
is the use of a space to separate parts of what must be
considered a single lexical item, e.g., blind alley. His-
torically, this was undoubtedly a metaphor (and a
candidate for this study); today it is most probably
interpreted as a single unit. Although most native
speakers of English would classify it as an idiom
through an awareness of the written form and the fact
that even in the spoken version the component parts
are clearly recognized, there should be no attempt to
componentially process such forms.

3. Salience
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999682461538461">
One of the most useful notions for modeling meta-
phoric understanding is that of salience (Ortony
1979a), which Ortony takes to mean an estimation of
&amp;quot;prominence of a particular attribute with respect to a
concept to which it does or could apply.&amp;quot; (p. 162.)
He later speaks of &amp;quot;predicates&amp;quot; rather than attributes&amp;quot;
(1979b, p. 191): &amp;quot;A predicate can be attributed to, or
predicated of, something. It can represent knowledge,
a belief, or an attitude about or toward something.&amp;quot; I
too prefer the flexibility of &amp;quot;predicate&amp;quot; and shall fol-
low Ortony in the use of this term.
The notion of salience makes use of the apparent
fact that metaphorical statements are asymmetric:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.908890166666667">
(2) Billboards are like warts
means something different from
(3) Warts are like billboards
Ortony&apos;s explanation is that in isolated sentences of
the form
(1) A is (like) B
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97831">
those predicates that have high salience in B and low
salience in A are the ones being considered in the
metaphor.1 The effect is one of raising the salience of
these predicates in A. Thus, sentence (2) is generally
understood as meaning that billboards are ugly, where-
as in (3), those predicates that have high salience for
billboards (but low salience in warts) — for example,
prominence — are attributed to warts (that is, the sali-
ence is raised). An additional requirement is that
there be high salient predicates of B that cannot apply
to A.2
My working definition of salience includes the as-
sumption of a taxonomic structure of concepts with
the most general at the top and the most specific at
the bottom. Figure 1 provides an illustration of a
simple taxonomy.
I define a salient predicate of a concept as one that
implies inherent prominence (for example, saturation
of color, largeness of size, etc.) or else is definitional
in that it entails a concept&apos;s separation from others in
the hierarchy (for example, the dog&apos;s domesticity sepa-
rates it from the wolf). My notion of salience paral-
lels that of Tversky (1977) in that intensity and diag-
nosticity are the critical factors, but it makes the addi-
tion of hierarchical organization to facilitate
diagnosticity.3 Context, both linguistic and extralin-
guistic, is of course a major contributing factor too,
but it is outside the scope of this study. The way in
which these factors interrelate is a fertile area for psy-
chological research.

4. Prototypicality
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999854090909091">
Another valuable contribution coming out of cognitive
psychology is prototype theory (Rosch 1973, Rosch
and Mervis 1975), which holds that a concept may
belong to a category even if it is somewhat atypical in
terms of the predicates usually (typically) associated
with members of that category. A chicken is a bird
even though it can&apos;t really fly. Here, bird refers to
some prototype from which chicken represents a de-
parture.
In terms of metaphors, there is much value in in-
cluding prototype theory in any model. For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.936885">
(4) Mary&apos;s cheeks are like apples
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.77915275">
Ortony acknowledges that the att.&apos;butes may be similar, not
identical, in the vehicle and topic (1979a, p. 167). While I am in
agreement with Ortony, I will, for the purposes of this paper, make
the assumption of predicate identity.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.710155272727273">
2 In testing this hypothesis experimentally, Gentner (1980)
showed that salience did not appear to be a relevant mechanism in
metaphor processing. This seems to me, however, to be partially a
result of how salience was measured and the need for a clearer
analysis of how metaphoric interpretation proceeds. Salience,
properly defined, may provide a necessary but not sufficient expla-
nation.
3 Conklin and McDonald (1982) have used salience as a means
of solving the selection problem in natural language generation
using KL-ONE as the representation language.

would probably mean to most people that Mary&apos;s
cheeks are round and red. A different interpretation
would be obtained if the concept of round, red apple
were replaced by a withered, rotten one or even, for
that matter, by a green one. For communication to
take place among people in a speech community, some
sort of prototypicality considerations are essential.
There is another way in which prototypicality might
figure in a discussion of metaphors. It seems probable
that the B term in
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.690234666666667">
(1) A is like B
represents the epitome of the predicate(s) that are true
of A and of interest in a given utterance, that is, B is
the prototypical representative of these predicates.
(Tversky (1977) observed that the B term is the more
prototypical of the two in literal sentences.) If the
sentence reverses A and B, then A becomes the proto-
type of (probably) different predicates. The vehicle of
choice should be one in which the cluster of predicates
is (ideally) uniquely appropriate, prototypical, and
therefore also salient. For example,
(5) A hose is like a snake
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998179181818182">
Snakes are typically, even classically, the ultimate in
long, narrow, coiledness; these characteristics can be
thought of as distinguishing snakes from other mem-
bers of the category ANIMALS. Sentence (5) draws
the reader&apos;s attention to these (perhaps) slightly less
salient qualities of a hose.
I have intentionally limited myself to sentences
taken out of the discourse context. One of the bene-
fits of doing this is that there is considerable context
within the sentence itself that can influence its inter-
pretation. Consider the following pair of sentences
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999116">
(6) My cat&apos;s tail is like a carrot
(7) John&apos;s hair is like a carrot
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999501111111111">
Without adding any context, it is unlikely that a per-
son would miss the fact that the relevant salient predi-
cate of (6) is shape (and perhaps color) and that of
(7) is color. Our knowledge of prototypical cats with
prototypical cat tail shapes and colors and prototypical
hair shapes and colors leads us to the right conclusion.
If no additional information is available, then it
wouldn&apos;t be likely that John was wearing a pony tail.
On the other hand
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.953595333333333">
(8) John&apos;s nose is like a carrot
again, taken out of context, would indicate a comment
about shape. From these examples it should be clear
that prototypicality considerations are relevant to both
topic and vehicle.
5. Prototypicality and Possibility
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9553105">
How then, does this relate to prototype theory? The
relationship appears to be that, in the prototypical tail,
nose, or hair, certain predicates are probable. These
are the ones most likely to match those salient in B.
Thus in order to process metaphors, it is necessary to
know, in addition to the nature of the prototype, a
range of probable values for a given predicate. This
would facilitate Ortony&apos;s determination (1979a, p.
173) of &amp;quot;whether any gross incompatibility would
result by applying the predicate in question to the

concept.&amp;quot; This range can help determine whether the
statement is literally true or not. For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.865075">
(9) John&apos;s hands are like ice.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997873">
If a range of possible temperatures were built into the
representation for human hands, it would be known
that John&apos;s hands could not possibly be literally as
cold as ice (there could not be an actual equivalence
of temperature in hands and in ice).4 The figurative
interpretation would thus prevail.
Prototypicality and range of possible values appear
to operate throughout language as a whole; they are
not confined to figurative usage. Labov (1973) re-
ported on an experiment on the denotation of the
word cup. He gave subjects pictures of cuplike objects
to identify and observed differing percentages of the
use of cup as form and function were varied. He con-
cluded the existence of an invariant core
(corresponding to my use of prototype) as well as a
range of deviations through which recognition still
occurred, albeit at lower percentages. The inclusion of
these elements in the knowledge representation of a
system for understanding natural language is therefore
broadly motivated.

6. Metaphors as Hyperboles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9742524">
All metaphors are hyperbolic in a sense. They seem to
say: the predicates A shares with B are in A so ex-
treme that they can only be expressed by relating them
to some object in which they are epitomized, that is,
B. In
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.968316">
(9) John&apos;s hands are like ice,

<bodyText confidence="0.969816">
the exaggeration is apparent. This is evident because
of the range of possible temperature values known to
be actually attributable to human hands. The sentence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.739601363636364">
(7) John&apos;s hair is like a carrot.
is less metaphoric (consequently more literal) in this
sense. It is possible that hair could be the same color
as the prototypical carrot, but the probability is low.
Consequently, the following sequence does not seem
absurd:
(10) John&apos;s hair is like a carrot.
Is it really that color?
whereas
(11) John&apos;s hands are like ice.
Are they really that cold?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992365">
would lead one to think the response peculiar at the
least. On some scale of metaphoricity then, (10) is
less metaphoric than (11). Since a hose may in fact
be as long, narrow, coiled as a snake,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.680483">
4 If John is assumed to be living and context does not indi-
cate the possibility of frostbite conditions.
(5) A hose is like a snake
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997544">
is the least metaphoric of the examples given. This
supports Ortony&apos;s claim that high salient predicates of
A matched with high salient predicates of B make for
a literal statement. A response of Is it really that long,
narrow, coiled? could easily be followed by an unquali-
fied response of &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;
Ortony (1975) denies the possibility of the ground
consisting merely of a single predicate. &amp;quot;People sim-
ply do not use metaphors to transfer one characteristic,
even if it is a distinctive one, when there is a ready
literal way of making the point.&amp;quot; (p. 50.) Sentence
(9), however, provides a fairly good counterexample to
this claim. Here, the hyperbolic nature of the meta-
phor rather than the size of the ground provides the
incentive for its use.

7. Taxonomic Structure and Incongruity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999033375">
The conclusion which should be drawn from this dis-
cussion is that all of the above factors must be brought
to bear in an analysis of metaphor understanding. The
result of using these measures will be an isolation of
those predicates of B that are true of A and the estab-
lishment of a relative degree of metaphoricity within
the sentence context.
Given a corpus of sentences of the form
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.587573">
(1) A is (like) B,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.6810595">
some will appear to be literal similarity statements;
others will appear to be metaphors.

<listItem confidence="0.998918666666667">
(12) John is like his father.
(13) John is like a snake.
(14) John is like a black box.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970820952380952">
In (12), the sentence appears to be a literal compari-
son. John shares certain characteristics with his fa-
ther. John and his father are already known to be
similar on the basis of the fact that they are members
of the same superordinate category (males) or are
already known to participate in a relationship to one
another (father-son). There is no element of surprise
or incongruency in statement (12). As Ortony has
proposed, high salient predicates of B are also high
salient predicates of A. This is Ortony&apos;s criterion for
a literal similarity statement as opposed to a metaphor.
I think, however, that viewing this phenomenon from
the perspective of category membership, relationship
and consequent incongruity will shed more light on its
computation representation.
There do seem to be metaphorical statements in
which there is matching of high salient predicates in
both the vehicle and the topic. If sentence
(8) John&apos;s nose is like a carrot
were uttered by one of John&apos;s friends to another, it
would not represent new information. It would proba-

bly produce laughter because of the hierarchical incon-
gruity but beyond this should have no more of an ef-
fect than a literal paraphrase of the same sentence. In
terms of those predicates that can be shared, those
peculiar to the vehicle&apos;s hierarchical position — for
example, in (8), a carrot&apos;s being a root crop — seem
the least likely candidates.
The position in a taxonomic hierarchy is important
in another way. Consider

(16) Dogs are like wolves.
(16) is a similarity statement; (15), assuming an inter-

<bodyText confidence="0.9819141">
pretation can be found, is a metaphor. Figure 1 pro-
vides a possible explanation: In terms of this diagram,
dogs and wolves are siblings but penguins and wolves
are not. The latter relationship is more distant, the
sentence more metaphorical. Although distance met-
rics are notoriously difficult to pin down, fairly clear
cases like this one indicate that members of categories
at a level of abstraction close to that of Rosch&apos;s basic
level categories (1973) and with a shared superordi-
nate can be considered in some way closer than those
without a shared one. Empirical research on other
categorical relationships may provide additional sup-
port for this approach. Although less is known about
the relationships in the examples that follow, since
they no longer deal with a basic level category and its
immediate superordinate, future research may shed
some light on this phenomenon as well.
For example, that incongruity may be a factor of
&amp;quot;goodness&amp;quot; of metaphor seems to be illustrated by
(13) and (14). Metaphors may be judged by the ap-
parent unlikeliness of an A B juxtaposition. This of
course is under the provision that the metaphor is
understandable to the hearer. Thus (14), if under-
stood to mean that John is somehow unknowable, is
better than (13) in which John is thought to be
sneaky. The difference may be that in (13) A and B
are of a shared superordinate category (ANIMALS),
whereas in (14) they are categorically more remote.
Incongruity appears to be the reason that the best
metaphors often produce a smile by the hearer as they
are comprehended. (&amp;quot;How unlikely yet how apt&amp;quot; may
be the attendant thought.) So there is a connection
between metaphor and humor, or the intelligence and
wit of the speaker who first utters a good, novel meta-
phor.
8. Number of Shared Predicates
In addition to incongruity, another attribute of meta-
phoric quality is the number of shared characteristics
under incongruous circumstances. The more the better
so long as incongruity is maintained:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.890073">
(17) Jane&apos;s eyes are like stars
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9730625">
Although (17) is somewhat hackneyed, its survival and
wide use may be a result of the fact that it is good in
the sense just described, that is, incongruity plus mul-
tiplicity of shared predicates (twinkliness, brightness,
beauty, clarity, etc.).
Some writers have talked of the magic of meta-
phors, the idea that the whole is equal to more than
the sum of its parts (Verbrugge 1980). While there
may be other factors involved than those I have men-
tioned above, I believe ultimately that metaphors can
at least theoretically be accounted for formally and
without appeal to the supernatural.

9. Expressing the Inexpressible
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999591">
Why do people use metaphors? Inexpressibility in
literal terms seems to provide part of the answer.5
Hyperbole as discussed above is one way that this is
overcome. When an extreme in terms of predicates is
unavailable to the speaker, he or she may search other
domains (categories) for something that epitomizes the
desired quality. Metaphor makes the difficult to ex-
press possible to express.
This provides an explanation of the fact that human
emotions (love, hate, etc.) are often described meta-
phorically, that is, the less well-understood in terms of
the more thoroughly understood. It also helps explain
the observation that more abstract concepts with few
if any high salient predicates are used for A while
more concrete concepts (with predicates of high sali-
ence) are used for B. There are many examples of
metaphors for love, friendship, etc. in which B is a
concrete concept having usable salient predicates.
Metaphors appear commonly with regard to people
to express something about their more abstract person-
al characteristics (personality, character, value) rather
than the more easily stated physical attributes.6 Thus,
when searching for the meaning of such metaphors, all
other things being equal, one should generally exhaust
those first. When one says,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.764075">
(18) You are my sunshine,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969088833333333">
one is not attributing yellowness to the addressee but
rather those characteristics that are both more abstract
and possible to attribute to a human — that is, warmth,
brightness, cheerfulness, etc. If such characteristics
are unavailable or not salient in the B term, then oth-
er, physical ones are used in the interpretation.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.554123">
(19) Jane is a string bean,

<bodyText confidence="0.997199666666667">
for example, makes a statement about Jane&apos;s shape.
It should be noted at this point that I am not mak-
ing any claims about the historical primacy of physical
over more abstract predicates (as do Lakoff and John-
son 1980). I am not assuming (nor am I contradict-
ing) the possibility that this is true. The process by
which it came to pass that we can now say &amp;quot;John is a
bright person&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;That is a bright light&amp;quot; is not the
issue. It does seem reasonable that the abstract was at
one time a metaphor based on the physical, but I don&apos;t
know what the historical evidence is for this. My
analysis of metaphor is strictly a synchronic one. I am

explaining this phenomenon in which physical descriptors occupy a
relatively low position. An interpretation is obtained by searching

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970105333333333">
In extending the context of a metaphorical sentence to
include the surrounding linguistic environment, Ortony
(1979a) has suggested that the effect of the linguistic
environment is to raise the salience of certain predi-
cates. To analyze this notion, consider the following
pair:

the snakelike curviness of the highway. Note however
that the other attributes that have high salience in (20)

Metaphors in literature, especially poetry, represent
a possible limit to which a computational model might
aspire since poets are experts in the novel use of lan-
guage and in explicating human experiences. But it is
true that these sources should not be overlooked just
because they seem to present difficult problems; a
language understander should at least theoretically be
able to understand poetic metaphors. This poem by
Emily Bronte7 is metaphorically fairly straightforward
as poems go and a good illustration of how metaphors
in context can function.
Love and Friendship
Love is like the wild rose-briar,
Friendship like the holly tree—
The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms
But which will bloom most constantly?
The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring,
Its summer blossoms scent the air;
Yet wait till winter comes again

And who will call the wild-briar fair?
Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now
And deck thee with the holly&apos;s sheen,
That when December blights they brow
He still may leave thy garland green.
The first two lines represent two similes of the sort
that I have been discussing; in each case an abstract
concept is juxtaposed with a concrete one. The re-
mainder of the poem proceeds to describe the ground
of the similes. Certainly the ground consists of some
of the low salient predicates of wild rose-briars and
holly bushes. This seems to expand Ortony&apos;s thesis
that high salient predicates of B are the only ones to
be considered. Those of low salience are also eligible.
Including these predicates in the context of the poem
serves to raise the salience of some predicates the
reader may not have even had in his/her conceptual
representation prior to reading the poem. Love and
wild rose-briars do make an incongruous twosome as
do friendship and holly trees. The success of the met-
aphor rests on this and on the size of the ground. The
best metaphors are those presented by the best poets,
those in which a vaguely understood experience is
clarified through the predicates, salient or otherwise,
of the B terms. Ortony&apos;s compactness thesis (1975),
which allows metaphors to cause the transfer of fea-
tures or characteristics as a &amp;quot;chunk&amp;quot; from vehicle to
topic, does not account for this type of metaphoric
discourse.

<bodyText confidence="0.997619837837838">
From the above discussion it is obvious that some sort
of conceptual representation underlies human meta-
phor understanding; at some level people know the
predicates of concepts and presumably something
about their organization in terms of a generality hier-
archy. Our &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; undoubtedly includes, in
addition to what might be labeled general knowledge,
the values and beliefs of our speech community. Al-
though the computational representation of such a
base is a formidable task, the purpose of this paper is
to delineate its nature and boundaries. It is assumed
that the implementation of a base, in actuality, is a
separable task.
KL-ONE is one of a number of extant knowledge
representation languages that allow Concepts to be
arranged in a generality hierarchy with the characteris-
tic that properties of the more general Concepts are
inheritable by the more specific ones. It furthermore
provides for the Concept to be represented as a struc-
tured object, allowing one, in effect, to get inside the
Concept and to see its relationship to other Concepts.
In this discussion, I will assume that the features of
KL-ONE are available for use in metaphor processing.
The KL-ONE entities most relevant to this study are
Concepts (diagrammatically represented by ellipses)
and Roles (represented by encircled squares).8 The
structured Concept is the primary representational
entity. A Role is internal to a Concept; it can be a
part (for example, a hand is a Role of the Concept
BODY) or what is commonly called an attribute (for
example, a PERSON — the Concept — has habits — a
Role). I will use Roles to represent predicates as they
have been described above. The hierarchical classifi-
cation aspect of KL-ONE allows lower, less general,
Concepts to inherit structured description from those
in an ancestral relationship to them.
At the topmost level are the most general Con-
cepts, called Generic Concepts (GCs). As one pro-
ceeds downward through the network, one encounters
more and more specific GCs. At the lowest level is
knowledge about an individual, called an Individual
Concept (IC) (see Figure 2). ANIMAL (a GC of a
higher level) passes down to PERSON (a GC of a low-
er level) all of its Roles and the interrelationships
among them. So if ANIMALS have noses then so do
PEOPLE. PERSON in turn passes to JOHN (an IC,
shaded in Figure 2) those Roles PERSON got from
ANIMAL as well as those unique to PERSON.9 The
Value and Satisfies links indicate the relationship be-
tween a Role of an IC (called an IRole) and its parent
role.
Since the kind of knowledge necessary for meta-
phor processing must include the beliefs and cultural
values of the members of the community for which the
system is being designed, in the representation of a
prototype, some stereotyping is inevitable. That
snakes are frightening and perhaps evil creatures is a
commonly held opinion, although of course this is not
true of all snakes. Metaphors seem to tap these kinds
of generalizations in their insistence on prototypes,
and they do seem necessary for understanding to take
place.
(24) The whip lay coiled on the ground like a

8 The local internal structure of every Concept is made up of
Roles and RoleSet Relations (RSRs). This discussion will not
describe the functioning of RSRs but will focus on Roles since they
are adequate to support this theory at its present stage of develop-
ment. Furthermore, RSRs are less clearly understood at the current
state of KL-ONE&apos;s design than are Roles. (I use the term &amp;quot;Roles&amp;quot;
instead of &amp;quot;RoleSets&amp;quot; for discursive simplicity.) Those readers who
have an interest in a more detailed description of the knowledge
representation language KL-ONE should consult Brachman (1978,
1979) and Schmolze and Brachman (1982).

is also a distinction drawn between definitions and assertions. My
examples will deal only with definitions. I will not discuss issues
related to the definability of Concepts here. For a treatment of
this, see Cohen (1982b).

That the more affective (here, negative) aspects of
peoples&apos; impressions of snakes are of importance, and
not simply shape or the more physical characteristics,
seems evident by making a comparison
(25) The whip lay coiled on the ground like a strand
of spaghetti.
The fact that a snake might strike and inflict harm
from a coiled position (even though many types of
snakes would not) shows how generalizations seem to
operate. The menacing nature of the whip is high-
lighted in (24), but in (25) that aspect of whips is
much less important. In fact, it can be considered to
be &amp;quot;negated&amp;quot; by (25).
It should be noted at this point that one network
alone may not suffice in processing metaphors or, for
that matter, in processing other language phenomena.
The existence of sublanguages is generally accepted
within the field of linguistics: there are technical sub-
languages for technical fields, for example. The repre-
sentation must parallel and support this phenomenon.
An individual&apos;s style of speech also changes according
to the social setting; a person surely has more than
one style. At the least, there is careful speech and
casual speech. In lecturing to a class, one would use a
more careful variety than in chatting with one&apos;s
friends. I propose that there also exist sub-knowledge
networks to support different styles of speech. Again,
at the least there would be a careful and a casual vari-
ety. Formal situations would favor the careful; infor-
mal situations the casual. The other could then be a
reasonable second choice.
As an example, a veterinarian would have one rep-
resentation of the animal kingdom for use on the job
and one for home use. The careful (or more techni-
cal) one might look like an expanded and detailed
version of Figure 2. The sentence John is an animal
might receive one interpretation (the literal one) at
work where, due to the nature of the representation
(and of course the context), the metaphorical interpre-
tation is less likely. At home, the metaphorical one
might prevail. Underlying it could be a representation
like Figure 3. (Notice that in addition to the NAME of
the Role (of no computational interest) there is the
pointer labeled V/R This stands for Value/Restriction
and provides information about the fillers of a Role.
V/Rs must be other Concepts. NAME and V/R are
two facets that Roles can be thought of as having.)
The common person may well consider him or herself
to be different from the animals (witness the
creationist-evolutionist debates). Then John is an
animal would no longer fall into a generality, specifici-
ty situation and, although PEOPLE and ANIMALS are
in a sibling relationship to one another, the relation-
ship is between members of categories far more ab-
stract than basic level categories. Thus, the incongrui-
ty would make the metaphorical interpretation more
likely.&amp;quot;
ti I am grateful to Robert Dietz and Loretta Hirsch (personal
communication) for the example that led me to this refinement.

With metaphors as with other forms of user input,
contradictions with the knowledge base may occur.
The idea of a user contradicting the knowledge of the
system raises the issue of the relationship between
these two. The core of knowledge originally stored in
the base should be thought of as having been created
by an expert to be used by a layman. Consequently,
information supplied by the user should have a differ-
ent status from that of the original designer of the
system. However, for communication with the system
to take place, discourse elements must at least tempo-
rarily be integrated into the knowledge base.12
The kind of contradictions most common in meta-
phors will be those involving a change in salience. For
example, the system may know that John is an attrac-
tive guy with sloppy eating habits. Both may be con-
sidered of equal salience in this case. If the user ut-
ters
(27) John is a pig,
then the salience of his eating habits for this user has
been elevated beyond that of his otherwise pleasant
demeanor. (This is referred to as predicate promotion
in Ortony 1979b.) On the other hand,
12 Others have provided for discourse phenomena in repre-
senting knowledge. For example, see sections on semantic knowl-
edge and discourse knowledge in Walker (1978) for a discussion of
the discourse component of the SRI speech understanding system.
The relationship of context to non-literal language is explored in
Ortony, Schallert, Reynolds, and Antos (1978).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.510339">
(28) John is a doll

<bodyText confidence="0.999039409090909">
would have the opposite effect. John&apos;s being an at-
tractive guy is a more important characteristic of John
for this user. In the somewhat unlikely event that
both (27) and (28) were uttered by the same user, the
salience of both would be elevated.
How then can a representation system like KL-ONE
be used? It should first be noted that in the interest
of prototypicality considerations I will follow Cohen
(1982b) in allowing V/Rs on Roles of a Concept to
include an exclusive disjunction of possible values,
weighted by typicality. The lower Concepts can then
restrict these to the appropriate ones. These Concepts
can in turn also be ordered by typicality. In Figure 4
then, RED is a more typical color for an APPLE than
GREEN and a DELICIOUS apple is a more typical ap-
ple than a GRANNY SMITH. These rankings are indi-
cated by the symbol &amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot;. This representation of
APPLE, having as it does only one Role, is of course
highly simplified. Here, color is restricted to RED or
GREEN, where RED and GREEN are other Concepts in
the network.
If the sentence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.869568">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7214872">
is to be understood, it is necessary to have a Concept
of the prototypical apple. Among the members of the
community that would understand this, surely the col-
or of prototypical apples is red (see Figure 4 — RED &gt;
GREEN and DELICIOUS &gt; GRANNY SMITH).

would certainly have a different interpretation.
In Figure 5, notice that for the concept HAND,
temperature is not terribly salient.13 I have also intro-
duced a range of values as a possible value restriction,
here 3-6. So this means that hands prototypicality
range from hot to cold. In considering the Concept
ICE (Figure 6), notice that it has a temperature of 7,
that is, extremely cold. Temperature is highly salient
for ICE(=1).
Figure 6 also illustrates the relationship between a
higher Concept, SOLIDS, and a lower one, ICE. The
Roles of SOLIDS are inherited by ICE. In some repre-
sentations they are inherited intact, but here the Re-
stricts link causes a restriction of the fillers of the Role
in question. Thus, TEMPERATURE is restricted to 7;
TEXTURE is restricted to HARD/SMOOTH.
13 I have provided for salience to assume values between zero
(least salient) and one (most salient). The algorithm for the com-
putation of these values awaits further empirical results. At pres-
ent, they represent an estimate based on my intuitions.

What then would be the result of the user input
(9) John&apos;s hands are like ice.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989844">
Looking at a portion of John&apos;s network integrated with
the one for HAND (Figure 7), sentence (9) would
cause one to look at the Roles for John&apos;s hands, see
that they do not Restrict the Roles of the Generic
Concept HAND. Therefore, they are thought by the
system to be prototypical hands. Temperature is the
most salient feature of ICE for which John has a Role.
This must be the Role indicated by (9). The user has
made a hyperbolic statement. He or she has said that
John&apos;s hand temperature is inexpressible by reference
to normal hand temperatures. Thus, to understand the
sentence, it is necessary to observe that ICE has a
much more extreme value for temperature and it is of
the highest salience (=1). As a result, for the purpos-
es of this discourse, the salience of John&apos;s hand temp-
erature is given the value of 1, implying that for the
speaker John&apos;s hands are one of his most salient fea-
tures. This information may be useful in interpreting
the discourse that follows the sentence.
The incongruity that must be present for metaphors
to work can also be seen by referring to these dia-
grams, particularly with regard to their hierarchical
nature. It is clear that a metaphorical statement is
possible between members of an inheritance relation-
ship

since these are actual statements of that relationship.
A deeper analysis of human classification devices
promises to yield further constraints on pairs that can
relate metaphorically to one another. For example,
looking back at
(12) John is like his father,
since both John and his father share the same immedi-
ate superordinate category, male, (12) cannot be
metaphoric. This may also explain why

2. Establish those salient predicates for the vehicle for
which the topic also has a Role (for example,
TEMPERATURE for ICE and JOHN&apos;s HANDS).
3. If the V/Rs for these Roles are extreme in the vehi-
cle but not in the topic, the utterance is hyperbolic.
If, in addition, the vehicle and topic are in the
proper relationship to one another with respect to
the taxonomy, the utterance is metaphorical. Giv-
en that these conditions hold, raise the salience of
the relevant Roles of the topic.
We have begun the computer implementation of
this algorithm using NIL on a VAX 11/780. We have
implemented enough of the features of KL-ONE to
allow us to build a prototype knowledge base (in prog-
ress) that will be rich enough to permit experimenta-
tion using input consisting of novel metaphors. We
intend to exercise the system with the goal of estab-
lishing the correctness or need for refinement of the
algorithm.

12. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855666666667">
To summarize, I have demonstrated how metaphor
comprehension can proceed on the foundation of sali-
ence, with the following modifications to the theories
of Ortony: High salient predicates of the A term can
be those at issue in a metaphorical (as opposed to
strictly literal) interpretation and low salient features
of the B term likewise are of concern. Because of
other factors that serve to motivate the use of meta-
phors (incongruity, hyperbole, inexpressibility), meta-
phors are not always compact, nor are they prohibited
from being used for a single predicate.
Prototype theory applies in two ways: the B term is
generally chosen as prototypical of certain predicates;
the real-world representative of the B term is a proto-
typical member of its class.
In my utilization of KL-ONE, I have allowed for a
range of possible values in the value restriction facet
and introduced salience as a role facet. I have also
demonstrated the need for sub-knowledge networks in
dealing with metaphors and other natural language
issues.

13. The Large Scope of Things
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994197707317073">
Although this approach to natural language and
knowledge representation has been from the point of
view of metaphors, it seems clear that at least some of
the factors operating in metaphor understanding oper-
ate in literal language as well. There is undoubtedly a
relationship between salience raising in metaphors and
the resultant effect on discourse and focus of atten-
tion. In fact, salience raising undoubtedly contributes
to focusing. I have only dealt lightly with discourse
problems and recognize these as crucial to all language
understanding, whether the language be literal or fig-
urative.
It should be noted that the approach I have taken
ignores the possibility of considering metaphors as
analogies. Since many are not analogies, I will save
that for future work. That they exist is clear:
(35) Giraffes are like skyscrapers
is somewhat more complicated to understand
(computationally speaking) than many of the ones I
have used in this discussion because it involves rela-
tionships among Roles and not Roles simply.
(Giraffes are the tallest animals, skyscrapers are the
tallest buildings.) Also, clearly, some analogies and
some metaphors are instructional (Ortony 1975).
(37) The structure of an atom is like the structure of
the solar system.
These appear to be used in building the representation
of a new concept (here, atoms). I have dealt here
only with representations of existing concepts.14
In addition, I have chosen to develop a method that
could be applied to handling novel metaphors as op-
posed to those recognized by Lakoff and Johnson
(1980) as general metaphors. A system could be
made more efficient by utilizing a technique such as
Carbonell (1981) has described for recognizing the
latter whenever they occur and incorporating my pro-
posals elsewhere.
Finally, as in the case of literal language, it is es-
sential to study recordings of natural speech to see
what people actually say. In metaphors as elsewhere,
there will be many surprises.

<abstract confidence="0.948918666666667">This study represents an exploration of the phenomenon of non-literal language (&amp;quot;metaphors&amp;quot;) and an approach that lends itself to computational modeling. Ortony&apos;s theories of the way in which salience and asymmetry function in human metaphor processing are explored and expanded on the basis of numerous examples. A number of factors appear to be interacting in the metaphor comprehension process. In addition to salience and asymmetry, of major importance are incongruity, hyperbolicity, inexpressibility, prototypicality, and probable value range. Central to the model is a knowledge representation system incorporating these factors and allowing for the manner in which they interact. A version of KL-ONE (with small revisions) is used for this purpose.</abstract>

Furthermore, RSRs are less clearly understood at the current state of KL-ONE&apos;s design than are Roles.

It should first be noted that in the interest of prototypicality considerations I will follow Cohen (1982b) in allowing V/Rs on Roles of a Concept to include an exclusive disjunction of possible values, weighted by typicality. The lower Concepts can then restrict these to the appropriate ones. These Concepts can in turn also be ordered by typicality. In Figure 4 then, RED is a more typical color for an APPLE than GREEN and a DELICIOUS apple is a more typical apple than a GRANNY SMITH. These rankings are indicated by the symbol &amp;quot;&gt;&amp;quot;. This representation of APPLE, having as it does only one Role, is of course highly simplified.

To analyze this notion, consider the following pair: (20a) Look how the highway curves (20b) It&apos;s just like a snake. (20a) can be thought of as raising the salience of curviness in that sentence. Compare this pair to (21) This highway is like a snake, that is, the isolated sentence. The difference between (20) and (21) is that in (20) the discourse phenomenon of focus (Grosz 1977, 1981) is operating. Attention is focused (and salience consequently raised) to the snakelike curviness of the highway. Note however that the other attributes that have high salience in (20) can also be applied metaphorically. It is just that one particularly snakelike attribute is highlighted in the pair. The following linguistic environment is also of importance and (22) Look at how he eats. Isn&apos;t John a pig! (23) Isn&apos;t John a pig! Look at how he eats.

For example, (9) John&apos;s hands are like ice. If a range of possible temperatures were built into the representation for human hands, it would be known that John&apos;s hands could not possibly be literally as cold as ice (there could not be an actual equivalence of temperature in hands and in ice).4 The figurative interpretation would thus prevail. Prototypicality and range of possible values appear to operate throughout language as a whole; they are not confined to figurative usage. Labov (1973) reported on an experiment on the denotation of the word cup. He gave subjects pictures of cuplike objects to identify and observed differing percentages of the use of cup as form and function were varied. He concluded the existence of an invariant core (corresponding to my use of prototype) as well as a range of deviations through which recognition still occurred, albeit at lower percentages. The inclusion of these elements in the knowledge representation of a system for understanding natural language is therefore broadly motivated. 6.

(19) Jane is a string bean, for example, makes a statement about Jane&apos;s shape. It should be noted at this point that I am not making any claims about the historical primacy of physical over more abstract predicates (as do Lakoff and Johnson 1980).

On some scale of metaphoricity then, (10) is less metaphoric than (11). Since a hose may in fact be as long, narrow, coiled as a snake, 4 If John is assumed to be living and context does not indicate the possibility of frostbite conditions. (5) A hose is like a snake is the least metaphoric of the examples given. This supports Ortony&apos;s claim that high salient predicates of A matched with high salient predicates of B make for a literal statement. A response of Is it really that long, narrow, coiled? could easily be followed by an unqualified response of &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; Ortony (1975) denies the possibility of the ground consisting merely of a single predicate. &amp;quot;People simply do not use metaphors to transfer one characteristic, even if it is a distinctive one, when there is a ready literal way of making the point.&amp;quot; (p. 50.) Sentence (9), however, provides a fairly good counterexample to this claim. Here, the hyperbolic nature of the metaphor rather than the size of the ground provides the incentive for its use. 7.

It should be noted that the approach I have taken ignores the possibility of considering metaphors as analogies. Since many are not analogies, I will save that for future work. That they exist is clear: (35) Giraffes are like skyscrapers is somewhat more complicated to understand (computationally speaking) than many of the ones I have used in this discussion because it involves relationships among Roles and not Roles simply. (Giraffes are the tallest animals, skyscrapers are the tallest buildings.) Also, clearly, some analogies and some metaphors are instructional (Ortony 1975). (37) The structure of an atom is like the structure of the solar system. These appear to be used in building the representation of a new concept (here, atoms). I have dealt here only with representations of existing concepts.14 In addition, I have chosen to develop a method that could be applied to handling novel metaphors as opposed to those recognized by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) as general metaphors. A system could be made more efficient by utilizing a technique such as Carbonell (1981) has described for recognizing the latter whenever they occur and incorporating my proposals elsewhere. </context>

Figure 1 provides an illustration of a simple taxonomy. I define a salient predicate of a concept as one that implies inherent prominence (for example, saturation of color, largeness of size, etc.) or else is definitional in that it entails a concept&apos;s separation from others in the hierarchy (for example, the dog&apos;s domesticity separates it from the wolf). My notion of salience parallels that of Tversky (1977) in that intensity and diagnosticity are the critical factors, but it makes the addition of hierarchical organization to facilitate diagnosticity.3 Context, both linguistic and extralinguistic, is of course a major contributing factor too, but it is outside the scope of this study.

For communication to take place among people in a speech community, some sort of prototypicality considerations are essential. There is another way in which prototypicality might figure in a discussion of metaphors. It seems probable that the B term in (1) A is like B represents the epitome of the predicate(s) that are true of A and of interest in a given utterance, that is, B is the prototypical representative of these predicates. (Tversky (1977) observed that the B term is the more prototypical of the two in literal sentences.) If the sentence reverses A and B, then A becomes the prototype of (probably) different predicates. The vehicle of choice should be one in which the cluster of predicates is (ideally) uniquely appropriate, prototypical, and therefore also salient. For example, (5) A hose is like a snake Snakes are typically, even classically, the ultimate in long, narrow, coiledness; these characteristics can be thought of as distinguishing snakes from other members of the category ANIMALS.

The more the better so long as incongruity is maintained: (17) Jane&apos;s eyes are like stars Although (17) is somewhat hackneyed, its survival and wide use may be a result of the fact that it is good in the sense just described, that is, incongruity plus multiplicity of shared predicates (twinkliness, brightness, beauty, clarity, etc.). Some writers have talked of the magic of metaphors, the idea that the whole is equal to more than the sum of its parts (Verbrugge 1980). While there may be other factors involved than those I have mentioned above, I believe ultimately that metaphors can at least theoretically be accounted for formally and without appeal to the supernatural.

This poem by Emily Bronte7 is metaphorically fairly straightforward as poems go and a good illustration of how metaphors in context can function.
