1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999816">
NetOwITM Server is a powerful text analysis
software product developed by IsoQuest, Inc. It
supports business intelligence by providing fast and
easy access to information stored on local Intranets
and the global Internet. It organizes, analyzes, and
summarizes data extracted by NameTagTM and any
Full-Text search engine. It then presents the data for
either searching or browsing. NameTag is a data
extraction and indexing tool that finds proper names
and other defined entities within an input text stream.
NetOwl is the total application built on the NameTag
core engine. NetOwl tags each desired document or
Web page by person, organization, location,
relationship and description giving you a browsable
&amp;quot;back-of-the-book index.&amp;quot; This allows for targeting
exactly key information that is sought. With NetOwl
it is no longer necessary to scroll through massive
amounts of text to find exactly what is useful.

2. Search Functionality
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875636363636">
NetOwl is a server-based program which generates
standard CGI commands that can be executed by any
standard Web browser. NetOwl&apos;s Loader ingests
documents from any text or HTML-based data source,
sequentially loads the documents, then passes them
on to NameTag and the full-text search engine for data
extraction. The full-text search engine data is stored in
a proprietary database while NameTag&apos;s extracted data
is stored in any ODBC-compliant database.
There are two major functional areas of the NetOwl
system. The NetOwl Server system consists of:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999625333333333">
• Loader
• Full-Text Search
• NameTag
• Database interface
• Client
•
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988626">
The second NetOwl functional area comprises
customization, maintenance and monitoring tools
which provide support to the underlying processes of
NetOwl:

<listItem confidence="0.996043">
• NetOwl Administrator Tool
• NetOwl Service Manager
•
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969106923076923">
Both major areas use the relational database for
information storage and retrieval. This is the only
link to each of the functional areas (i.e., all common
information is accessed from the central database).
The major functional areas never talk directly to each
other or require or pass information between each
other.
Loader
The Loader component of the NetOwl server collects
information to process (by crawling specified sites,
USENET news groups and/or locally accessible files)
and then creates an index of that data in the NetOwl
database.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.822683">
Full-Text Search
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985181733333333">
This Full-Text Search (FTS) component accepts text
documents from the loader and creates an index of all
relevant words. The index thus created can later be
searched by the client component to provide a list of
relevant documents given a set of keywords.
Database
The Database component stores the index information
generated by the Loader/NameTag combination. The
database is a relational database linking instances of
names to relationships, descriptions, aliases, and
documents. NetOwl does not supply the database. It
does, however, supply the interface to a database
through an ODBC layer so that any RDBMS system
can be used (e.g., Access, SQL Server, Oracle,
FoxPro, Informix, Sybase).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.607487">
Client
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99960225">
The term &amp;quot;client&amp;quot; refers to the user interface you will
use to browse NetOwl&apos;s visual index, display
summary information, and access information that is
most salient. The client component is either a CGI-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99491">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.984709375">
compliant program or an HTTP server extension
which accepts requests transmitted from your WWW
browser and returns an HTML page with the results
of the request. The client is the vehicle used to access
index information in the database.
The GUI interface provides you with direct access into
the NetOwl screens where you can design, submit,
save, load and delete queries. It then communicates
these queries to the database components and presents
you with the full document text along with a glossary
of the names, descriptions, relationships and words
found by NameTag and the FTS engine.
NameTag
NameTag represents the key technology behind
NetOwl&apos;s indexing ability. NameTag is a data
extraction engine that identifies and interprets key
elements of free text, particularly names of people,
organizations and locations. For each document it
reads, NameTag builds a signature that includes each
name or concept, where it&apos;s found in the document,
and how it&apos;s interpreted. For example, &amp;quot;Washington&amp;quot;
can be a city, state, last name, or part of a company
name, depending on the context &amp;quot;Sun&amp;quot; can be a last
name, one of several companies, or a celestial object.
NameTag identifies these pieces of information, helps
to interpret them and eliminate the ambiguity, and
pulls in associated information such as ticker
symbols for companies and variations of person
names. The technology behind NameTag itself is a
combination of a powerful pattern-matching technique
known as finite state interpretation with a carefully-
designed knowledge base.
