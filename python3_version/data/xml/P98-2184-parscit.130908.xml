Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999404709677419">
The probabilistic relation between verbs and
their arguments plays an important role in
modern statistical parsers and supertaggers,
and in psychological theories of language
processing. But these probabilities are
computed in very different ways by the two
sets of researchers. Computational linguists
compute verb subcategorization probabilities
from large corpora while psycholinguists
compute them from psychological studies
(sentence production and completion tasks).
Recent studies have found differences
between corpus frequencies and
psycholinguistic measures. We analyze
subcategorization frequencies from four
different corpora: psychological sentence
production data (Connine et al. 1984), written
text (Brown and WSJ), and telephone
conversation data (Switchboard). We find
two different sources for the differences.
Discourse influence is a result of how verb
use is affected by different discourse types
such as narrative, connected discourse, and
single sentence productions. Semantic
influence is a result of different corpora using
different senses of verbs, which have different
subcategorization frequencies. We conclude
that verb sense and discourse type play an
important role in the frequencies observed in
different experimental and corpus based
sources of verb subcategorization frequencies.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999814333333333">
The probabilistic relation between verbs and their
arguments plays an important role in modern
statistical parsers and supertaggers (Charniak
1995, Collins 1996/1997, Joshi and Srinivas 1994,
Kim, Srinivas, and Trueswell 1997, Stolcke et al.
1997), and in psychological theories of language
processing (Clifton et al. 1984, Ferreira &amp;
McClure 1997, Garnsey et al. 1997, Jurafsky 1996,
MacDonald 1994, Mitchell &amp; Holmes 1985,
Tanenhaus et al. 1990, Trueswell et al. 1993).
These probabilities are computed in very different
ways by the two sets of researchers.
Psychological studies use methods such as
sentence completion and sentence production for
collecting verb argument structure probabilities.
In sentence completion, subjects are asked to
complete a sentence fragment. Garnsey at al.
(1997) used a proper name followed by a verb,
such as &amp;quot;Debbie remembered &amp;quot; In
sentence subjects are asked to write any sentence
containing a given verb. An example of this type
of study is Confine et al. (1984).
An alternative to these psychological methods is
to use corpus data. This can be done
automatically with unparsed corpora (Briscoe and
Carroll 1997, Manning 1993, Ushioda et al. 1993),
from parsed corpora such as Marcus et al.&apos;s (1993)
Treebank (Merlo 1994, Framis 1994) or manually
as was done for COMLEX (Macleod and
Grishman 1994). The advantage of any of these
corpus methods is the much greater amount of
data that can be used, and the much more natural
contexts. This seems to make it preferable to
data generated in psychological studies.
Recent studies (Merlo 1994, Gibson et al. 1996)
have found differences between corpus
frequencies and experimental measures. This
suggests that corpus-based frequencies and
experiment-based frequencies may not be
interchangeable. To clarify the nature of the
differences between various corpora and to find
the causes of these differences, we analyzed

psychological sentence production data (Connine
et al. 1984), written discourse (Brown and WSJ
from Penn Treebank - Marcus et al. 1993), and
conversational data (Switchboard - Godfrey et al.
1992). We found that the subcategorization
frequencies in each of these sources are different.
We performed three experiments to (1) find the
causes of general differences between corpora, (2)
measure the size of these differences, and (3) find
verb specific differences. The rest of this paper
describes our methodology and the two sources of
subcategorization probability differences:
discourse influence and semantic influence.

2 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999770285714286">
For the sentence production data, we used the
numbers published in the original Connine et al.
paper as well as the original data, which we were
able to review thanks to the generosity of Charles
Clifton. The Connine data (CFJCF) consists of
examples of 127 verbs, each classified as
belonging to one of 15 subcategorization frames.
We added a 16th category for direct quotations
(which appeared in the corpus data but not the
Connine data). Examples of these categories,
taken from the Brown Corpus, appear in figure 1
below. There are approximately 14,000 verb
tokens in the CFJCF data set.
For the BC, WSJ, and SWBD data, we counted
subcategorizations using tgrep scripts based on the
Penn Treebank. We automatically extracted and
categorized all examples of the 127 verbs used in
the Connine study. We used the same verb
subcategorization categories as the Connine study.
There were approximately 21,000 relevant verb
tokens in the Brown Corpus, 25,000 relevant verb

where all verbs were equally represented, the
frequencies of each verb in the corpora varied.
For each calculation where individual verb
frequency could affect the outcome, we
normalized for frequency, and eliminated verbs
with less than 50 examples. This left 77 out of
127 verbs in the Brown Corpus, 74 in the Wall
Street Journal, and only 30 verbs in Switchboard.
This was not a problem with the Connine data

The purpose of the first experiment is to analyze
the general (non-verb-specific) differences
between argument structure frequencies in the
data sources. In order to do this, the data for each
verb in the corpus was normalized to remove the
effects of verb frequency. The average
frequency of each subcategorization frame was
calculated for each corpus. The average
frequencies for each of the data sources were then
compared.

3.1 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948428571429">
We found that the three corpora consisting of
connected discourse (BC, WSJ, SWBD) shared a
common set of differences when compared to the
CFJCF sentence production data. There were
three general categories of differences between the
corpora, and all can be related to discourse type.
These categories are:
</bodyText>

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.933621">
3.1.1 Passive Sentences
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998984">
The CFJCF single sentence productions had the
smallest number of passive sentences. The
connected spoken discourse in Switchboard had
more passives, followed by the written discourse
in the Wall Street Journal and the Brown Corpus.

<bodyText confidence="0.9994888">
Passive is generally used in English to emphasize
the undergoer (to keep the topic in subject
position) and/or to de-emphasize the identity of
the agent (Thompson 1987). Both of these
reasons are affected by the type of discourse. If
there is no preceding discourse, then there is no
pre-existing topic to keep in subject position. In
addition, with no context for the sentence, there is
less likely to be a reason to de-emphasize the
agent of the sentence.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.976278">
3.1.2 Zero Anaphora
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996994">
The increase in zero anaphora (not overtly
mentioning understood arguments) is caused by
two factors. Generally, as the amount of
surrounding context increases (going from single
sentence to connected discourse) the need to
overtly express all of the arguments with a verb
decreases.

Verbs that can describe actions (agree, disappear,
escape, follow, leave, sing, wait) were typically
used with some form of argument in single
sentences, such as:
&amp;quot;I had a test that day, so I really wanted to escape
from school.&amp;quot; (CFJCF data).
Such verbs were more likely to be used without
any arguments in connected discourse as in:
&amp;quot;She escaped , crawled through the usual mine
fields, under barbed wire, was shot at, swam a
river, and we finally picked her up in Linz.&amp;quot;
(Brown Corpus)
In this case, the argument of &amp;quot;escaped&amp;quot;,
(&amp;quot;imprisonment&amp;quot;) was understood from the
previous sentence. Verbs of propositional
attitude (agree, guess, know, see, understand) are
typically used transitively in written corpora and
single-sentence production:
&amp;quot;I guessed the right answer on the quiz.&amp;quot;
(CFJCF).
In spoken discourse, these verbs are more likely to
be used metalinguistically, with the previous

<bodyText confidence="0.3195598">
Quotations are usually used in narrative, which is
more likely in connected discourse than in an
isolated sentence. This difference mainly effects
verbs of communication (e.g. answer, ask, call,
describe, read, say, write).

In single sentence production, they are used to

&amp;quot;Ile asked a lot of questions at school.&amp;quot; (CFJCF)
We are currently working on systematically
identifying indirect quotes in the corpora and the
CFJCF data to analyze in more detail how they fit
in to this picture.

4 Experiment 2
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996">
Our first experiment suggested that discourse
factors were the primary cause of
subcategorization differences. One way to test
this hypothesis is to eliminate discourse factors
and see if this removes subcategorization
differences.
We measure the difference between the way a verb
is used in two different corpora by counting the
number of sentences (per hundred) where a verb in
one corpus would have to be used with a different
subcategorization in order for the two corpora to
yield the same subcategorization frequencies.
This same number can also be calculated for the
overall subcategorization frequencies of two
corpora to show the overall difference between the
two corpora.
Our procedure for measuring the effect of
discourse is as follows (illustrated using passive
as an example):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996500857142857">
1. Measure the difference between two corpora
(WSJ vs CFJCF)

2. Remove differences caused by discourse
effects (based on BC vs CFJCF). CFJCF has
22% the number of passives that BC has.
% Passive - BC vs CFJCF
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.907739333333333">
We then linearly scale the number of passives

corpora (WSJ vs CFJCF)

This method was applied to the passive, quote,
and zero subcat frames, since these are the ones
that show discourse-based differences. Before

the mapping, WSJ has a difference of 17
frames/100 overall difference when compared
with CFJCF. After the mapping, the difference
is only 9.6 frames/100 overall difference. This
indicates that 43% of the overall cross-verb
differences between these two corpora are caused
by discourse effects.
We use this mapping procedure to measure the
size and consistency of the discourse effects. A
more sophisticated mapping procedure would be
appropriate for other purposes since the verbs with
the best matches between corpora are actually
made worse by this mapping procedure.

Argument preference was also affected by verb
semantics. To examine this effect, we took two
sample ambiguous verbs, &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot;.
We hand coded them for semantic senses in each
of the corpora we used as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.987692">
We then asked two questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9970578">
1. Do different verb senses have different
argument structure preferences?
2. Do different corpora have different verb

different argument structure preferences?

<bodyText confidence="0.818843846153846">
For both verbs examined (pass and charge) there
was a significant effect of verb sense on argument
structure probabilities (by X2 p &lt;.001 for `charge&apos;
and p &lt;.001 for `pass&apos;). The following chart
shows a sam le of this difference:

This analysis shows that it is possible for shifts in
the relative frequency of each of a verbs senses to
influence the observed subcat frequencies.
We are currently extending our study to see if verb
senses have constant subcategorization
frequencies across corpora. This would be useful
for word sense disambiguation and for parsing.
If the verb sense is known, then a parser could use
this information to help look for likely arguments.
If the subcatagorization is known, then a
clisambiguator could use this information to find
the sense of the verb. These could be used to
bootstrap each other relying on the heuristic that
only one sense is used within any discourse (Gale,
Church, &amp; Yarowsky 1992).

Instead, we hand checked a random sample of our

for all verbs excluding &apos;say&apos; type verbs such as
&apos;answer&apos;, &apos;ask&apos;, &apos;call&apos;, &apos;read&apos;, &apos;say&apos;, and &apos;write&apos;.
The error rate is given as a range due to the
subjectivity of some types of errors. The errors

to find arguments that were located to the left of
the verb. This is because arbitrary amounts of
structure can intervene, expecially in the case of
traces.
Six percent of the data (overall) was improperly
classified due to the failure of our search patterns
to identify all of the quote-type arguments which
occur in &apos;say&apos; type verbs. The identification of
these elements is particularly problematic due to
the asyntactic nature of these arguments, ranging
from a sound (He said `Argh!&apos;) to complex
sentences. The presence or absense of quotation
marks was not a completely reliable indicator of
these arguments. This type of error affects only
a small subset of the total number of verbs. 27%
of the examples of these verbs were mis-classified,
always by failing to find a quote-type argument of
the verb. Using separate search strings for these
verbs would greatly improve the accuracy of these
searches.
Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular
expressions that work on flat tagged corpora
instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us
to gather information from larger corpora than
have been done by the TreeBank project (see
Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998).

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996652368421053">
We find that there are significant differences
between the verb subcategorization frequencies
generated through experimental methods and
corpus methods, and between the frequencies found
in different corpora. We have identified two
distinct sources for these differences. Discourse
influences are caused by the changes in the ways
language is used in different discourse types and
are to some extent predictable from the discourse
type of the corpus in question. Semantic
influences are based on the semantic context of the
discourse. These differences may be predictable
from the relative frequencies of each of the possible
senses of the verbs in the corpus. An extensive
analysis of the frame and sense frequencies of
different verbs across different corpora is needed to
verify this. This work is presently being carried
out by us and others (Baker, Fillmore, &amp; Lowe
1998). It is certain, however, that verb sense and

<abstract confidence="0.9997808125">The probabilistic relation between verbs and their arguments plays an important role in modern statistical parsers and supertaggers, and in psychological theories of language processing. But these probabilities are computed in very different ways by the two sets of researchers. Computational linguists compute verb subcategorization probabilities from large corpora while psycholinguists compute them from psychological studies (sentence production and completion tasks). Recent studies have found differences between corpus frequencies and psycholinguistic measures. We analyze subcategorization frequencies from four different corpora: psychological sentence production data (Connine et al. 1984), written text (Brown and WSJ), and telephone conversation data (Switchboard). We find two different sources for the differences. influence a result of how verb use is affected by different discourse types such as narrative, connected discourse, and sentence productions. Semantic is result of different corpora using different senses of verbs, which have different subcategorization frequencies. We conclude that verb sense and discourse type play an important role in the frequencies observed in different experimental and corpus based sources of verb subcategorization frequencies.</abstract>

Recent studies (Merlo 1994, Gibson et al. 1996) have found differences between corpus frequencies and experimental measures. This suggests that corpus-based frequencies and experiment-based frequencies may not be interchangeable. To clarify the nature of the differences between various corpora and to find the causes of these differences, we analyzed 1122 psychological sentence production data (Connine et al. 1984), written discourse (Brown and WSJ from Penn Treebank - Marcus et al. 1993), and conversational data (Switchboard - Godfrey et al. 1992). We found that the subcategorization frequencies in each of these sources are different. We performed three experiments to (1) find the causes of general differences between corpora, (2) measure the size of these differences, and (3) find verb specific differences.

This type of error affects only a small subset of the total number of verbs. 27% of the examples of these verbs were mis-classified, always by failing to find a quote-type argument of the verb. Using separate search strings for these verbs would greatly improve the accuracy of these searches. Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular expressions that work on flat tagged corpora instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us to gather information from larger corpora than have been done by the TreeBank project (see Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998). 7 Conclusion We find that there are significant differences between the verb subcategorization frequencies generated through experimental methods and corpus methods, and between the frequencies found in different corpora. We have identified two distinct sources for these differences. Discourse influences are caused by the changes in the ways language is used in different discourse types and are to some extent predictable from the discourse type of the corpus in question. Semantic influences are based on the semantic context of the discourse. These differences may be predictable from the rela</context>

This type of error affects only a small subset of the total number of verbs. 27% of the examples of these verbs were mis-classified, always by failing to find a quote-type argument of the verb. Using separate search strings for these verbs would greatly improve the accuracy of these searches. Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular expressions that work on flat tagged corpora instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us to gather information from larger corpora than have been done by the TreeBank project (see Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998). 7 Conclusion We find that there are significant differences between the verb subcategorization frequencies generated through experimental methods and corpus methods, and between the frequencies found in different corpora. We have identified two distinct sources for these differences. Discourse influences are caused by the changes in the ways language is used in different discourse types and are to some extent predictable from the discourse type of the corpus in question. Semantic influences are based on the semantic context of the discourse. These differences may be predictabl</context>

Data Source % passive sentences CFJCF 0.6% Switchboard 2.2% Wall Street Journal 6.7% Brown Corpus 7.8% Passive is generally used in English to emphasize the undergoer (to keep the topic in subject position) and/or to de-emphasize the identity of the agent (Thompson 1987). Both of these reasons are affected by the type of discourse. If there is no preceding discourse, then there is no pre-existing topic to keep in subject position. In addition, with no context for the sentence, there is less likely to be a reason to de-emphasize the agent of the sentence. 3.1.2 Zero Anaphora The increase in zero anaphora (not overtly mentioning understood arguments) is caused by two factors.
