Modern Chinese Mandarin has gone
through near a hundred years, it is very
important to store its representative

3460 hours video and audio files with
metadata tagging. The materials, which
were generated by the authoritative
speakers (e.g. announcers at TV or radio
station) with normality, are required

<bodyText confidence="0.998606674418605">
Modern Chinese Mandarin has gone through
near a hundred years. As language changes as
society develops, Mandarin must be periodically
marked with the different features of different
historical eras. It is very important to design and
construct a Chinese Mandarin Digital Multi-
modal Corpus (CMDMC), and store its repre-
sentative sample in digital form permanently.
It’s international trend to establish large-scale
natural language corpus, and many countries
pay more attention to research and preserve
their national language. For instance, the Lin-
guistic Data Consortium (LDC) is an open con-
sortium of universities, companies and govern-
ment research laboratories. It creates, collects
and distributes speech and text databases, lex-
icons, and other resources for research and de-
velopment purposes1. Since its foundation, the
LDC has delivered data to 197 member institu-
tions and 458 non-member institutions. Moreo-
ver, European Language Resources Association
(ELRA)2 is the driving force to make available
the language resources for language engineering
and to evaluate language engineering technolo-
gies. In order to achieve this goal, ELRA is ac-
tive in identification, distribution, collection,
validation, standardization, improvement, in
promoting the production of language resources,
in supporting the infrastructure to perform eval-
uation campaigns and in developing a scientific
field of language resources and evaluation. In
this paper, we intend to establish the CMDMC
with the goal of showing the history of the de-
velopment of Chinese Mandarin, and represen-
tation the real character in different historical
eras.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2
describes the resources and data processing of
our CMDMC. The experiment and evaluation is
designed and carried out in section 3. Section 4
is dedicated to analyze the syntactic correlations
of prosodic phrase in broadcast news speech on
CNR (China National Radio), and compare the

<bodyText confidence="0.999864611111111">
In order to show the history of the development
of Chinese Mandarin, and representation the
real character in different historical periods, the
CMDMC, which is a dynamic miniature model
(or speech museum) with diachronic, opened,
cross-media and sharable features, is designed
and constructed by Broadcast Media Language
Branch of National Language Resources
Monitor &amp; Research Center at Communication
University of China.
In China, announcers in Radio &amp; TV stations,
as well as movie or stage actors, are the authori-
ty of the national language standardization.
Therefore, the speech in radio, television and
movie can be taken as the paradigm and repre-
sentative of Mandarin. They can reflect the
phonetic situation of that era. All of these are
the source of the sample data for CMDMC.

2.1 Description of Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999744533333333">
In order to fully demonstrate the development
of Chinese Mandarin by the past 100 years, we
try to collect all the video or audio materials in
different periods. Therefore, a state-of-the-art
classification is defined based on the corpora
that we got.
Language styles: According to characteristic
speaking styles of different media, there are
three categories was defined, such as broadcast
media language, movie or drama dialogue, and
the dialogue in folk art (e.g. xiangsheng, ping-
shu etc.) and so on. To sum up, the three speak-
ing styles accounted for about 64.9%, 27.2%
and 7.9% of total corpora, respectively.
Mediums: The materials can be divided into
audio, video, text and image/picture. The audio
or video files are the main materials in our cor-
pus, and the aligned texts are transcribed based
on the audio or video. The documents of image
are subsidiary corpora.
Historical eras: Based on the characteristics
of social and language changes, we also define
six historical stages of Chinese Mandarin: 1)
Before1949 (or 1919-1949), it is a theoretical
stage for corpora collection. In fact, the earliest
speech materials, which we can collect, is re-
leased in 1932; 2) 1949-1965; 3) 1966-1977; 4)
1978-1989; 5) 1990-1999; 6) 2000 to today.

<bodyText confidence="0.999745181818182">
The data processing includes metadata tagging,
text transcription and aligning, phonetic and
prosodic annotation, POS and syntactic tagging
and so on.
As for labeling prosodic phrase boundaries,
we strictly dependent on the prosodic criteria
and perception by using the wave files and their
transcriptions, which use many prosodic fea-
tures such as F0 contour, energy contour etc. At
the same time, some spoken phenomena are
considered.

3 Experiment and Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999725428571429">
Firstly, in order to investigate the correlations
between prosody and syntax, about 13 hours
speech materials were selected to segment and
label, including break index, stress index and
summary of emotional tendentiousness etc.
Before the real annotation, six transcribers have
been trained in accordance with the prosodic
labeling conventions, until a high consistency of
prosodic annotation can be carried out.
According to above experiment and annota-
tion, the number of occurrences of the various
boundaries was calculated in table 2.
Secondly, we also designed a perception ex-
periment to determine phonetic diversification
for elimination as much as possible the subjec-
tivity which could be caused by the different
personal intuition of language. Ten people at-
tended the perception experiment of this study:
3 men and 7 women. The average age is 25
years. Nearly all of them were graduates major-
ing in linguistics. During the experiment, the
participants were asked to discriminate 12 para-
graphs of random materials and judge the natu-
ralness, pitch, and speech rate of the sentences
produced in each paragraph. These 12 para-
graphs consisted of 4 from 21 paragraphs of the
1995 version, 4 from 21 paragraphs of the 1975
version and 4 from modern materials.

4.1 Correlation between Syntax &amp; Prosody
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878796296297">
In English, there is a strong correlation between
prosodic phrase boundaries and syntactic phrase
boundaries (Price et al. 1991). That is to say,
prosodic phrase boundaries can play an impor-
tant role in understanding utterance as punctua-
tion marks do in written language. An investiga-
tion propose that boundary strength according to
the measure, which the boundary strength is
applied to syntactic structures and the phrase
structure is viewed as an immediate constituen-
cy tree exclusively, corresponds much more
closely to empirical prosodic boundary strength
than does syntactic boundary strength according
to a standard measure (Abney, 1992). In Greek,
some study indicated that prosodic phrasing has
a 95% identification rate, and a major effect on
final tonal boundaries (Botinis et al. 2004).
In Chinese, some researchers also proposed a
statistical model to predict prosodic words from
lexical words. In their model, both length of the
word and the tagging from POS are two essen-
tial features to predict prosodic words, and the
results showed approximately 90% of prediction
for prosodic words (Chen at el. 2004).
What the correlation between syntax and
prosody is in Chinese broadcasting news speech?
In order to investigate the syntactic correlations
of prosodic phrase in real read speech on radio,
we chose the representative speech materials
from Xinwen he Baozhi Zhaiyao (News and
Newspapers Summary) from CMDMC, which is
a very famous broadcast news program of CNR.
This news program contains more syntactic,
semantic and prosodic information, speaking
styles and high quality voice in real context.
Therefore, 908 programs, which contain 454
hours speech data from January 2006 to June
2008, were selected for pre-processing. After
the pre-processing step, we selected two fe-
male’s 13 hours speech materials (one female
announcer’s material forms the main data, and
another one’s is supplemented for comparable
data) as a core database, which segmentation,
transcription and prosodic annotation (including
break index, stress index and summary of emo-
tional tendentiousness etc) was made by six
transcribers.
According to the characteristic of broadcast-
ing news speech, a new prosodic hierarchical
structure (Zou et al. 2009) and two different
types of prosodic phrase (i.e. the normal prosod-
ic phrase and the complex prosodic phrase)
boundaries were defined and used in our data
labeling.

In the further step, we selected 100 minutes

<bodyText confidence="0.994999708333334">
There are two ways of representation to pitch
feature at prosodic boundary: Firstly, the pitch
contour is un-continuity; secondly, the pitch
resetting of the declination contour (de Pijper et
al 1994). According to Table 3, we can find that
there is a few resetting of bottom pitch value at
PW boundary, that is to say, the bottom of the
PW boundary right is 1.4 semitones higher than
that of its left. At other boundaries, the bottom
pitch values at right side are much higher than
that at left side, for instance, there is 3.1, 5.2,
9.9, 11.3 and 13.6 semitones resetting from PP
to MEC boundary successively. Especially, at
the IP boundary its resetting has about two
times than that of C-PP boundary. This shows
that there are very obvious prosodic feature at
various boundaries in broadcasting news speech.
Generally, we know that 90ms is the floor of
threshold for perceiving the silent pause. From
Table 4, the mean of silent pause duration from
long to short followed by MEC &gt; IG &gt; IP &gt; C-
PP &gt; PP &gt; PW. Except there is no perceived
silent pause at PW boundary, the other bounda-
ries have obvious silent pause that can be per-
ceived. The length of silent pause at PP and C-
PP are 97.6ms and 108.7ms respectively, and
the length at IP has over three times longer than
that at C-PP. According to this, we propose that
the PP and C-PP lie in the same position at the
prosodic hierarchical structure, and the C-PP is
a special prosodic phrase.
From our core data we got 6728 C-PPs. Ac-
cording to the C-PP that contains the number of
PW, we divided them into four categories, such
as three-PW, four-PW, five-PW and six-PW.
The distribution of them is shown in Table 5.
After preliminary analysis we found that the
C-PP, which contains three PWs, has a simple
syntactic structure although it is absolute major-
ity in the number, and that is compose of four
PWs should be done for correlations of prosody
and syntax. There are about 6 types of prosodic
structure if the C-PP contains four PWs. The
detail data of this type C-PP followed in table 6.
From the data, we know that the fourth type,
which is (A+B) +(C+D), is the most, and that is
composed by (A+B) +C+D is the least in all of
the six types. Although there are just six types
of prosodic structure that can be found, there are
more than 985 syntactic categories in this 1835
C-PPs. There are 23 types which occur more
than 10 times, and most of them occur only one
time. To some extent, it can explain that the
syntactic structure is more complex than the
prosodic one.
An example of prosodic and syntactic struc-
tures in the utterance, which is ou1 yang2 yu3
hang2 yi4 zhi1 shou3 jin3 jin0 bao4 zhu4 lou2
ti1 de0 lan2 gan1 (Ouyang Yuhang held fast to
the staircase railing with one hand), is given in
figure 1. The left side of figure is the prosodic
structure, and the syntactic one lies at the right
side.
In figure 1, there is a little difference of jin3
jin0 bao4 zhu4 lou2 ti1 de0 lan2 gan1 (V, V,

“A+(B+C+D)” and its syntactic structure “[VP
[VP jin3jin0/adv bao4zhu4/v] [NP [AP
lou2ti1/n de0/u] [NP lan2gan1/n]]]”, but the
differences between its prosodic and syntactic
structure are obvious because the jin3 jin0 is
stressed in speech for semantic expression.

lan2 gan1 (held fast to the staircase railing)
based on the length of perceived silent pause.
Furthermore, the pitch declination trend within
the C-PP is obvious despite small resetting be-
tween zhu4 and lou2. So we suggest that there is
a stable prosodic pattern within a C-PP in
broadcasting news speech.
Conversely, what is the correlation between
the prosody and syntax? From above analysis,
we know that the conjunction and particle, such
as ⱘ(de0), ㄝ(deng3),ff(he2), Ԛ(dan4) and so
on, more likely attached to the end of left struc-
ture or the beginning of right one and form a
prosodic word. If it has just four lexical words
including the conjunction or particle they form a
prosodic word by itself. That is to say, it has
very great flexibility in prosodic structures for
conjunctions and particles, such as “ ऴ

4.2 Diachronic Comparative Phonetic and
Prosodic Analysis in Movie Dialogues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987596315789474">
Which diachronic phonetic changes happened in
Mandarin by the past 100 years? We also ana-
lyze and compare the phonetic features of Chi-
nese Mandarin among several same-name mov-
ies in different historical eras from CMDMC
(Wang et al. 2010). In order to minimize the
divergence of the variables and maximize the
reliability of conclusions, we chose two pairs of
same-name movies screened in different histori-
cal periods. These movies are: Pingyuan Youji-
dui (The Plains Guerrillas) shot in 1955 and
1975, Dujiang Zhencha Ji (Reconnaissance
across the Yangtze River) shot in 1954 and 1974
respectively.
Pitch Feature: In the analysis of pitch, we
put aside the stresses and the neutral tone syl-
lables, and make the statistical investigations on
the top pitch value and the bottom pitch value of
the syllables.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.70459">
Figure 3: The pitch data of 1955 and 1975 ver-

<bodyText confidence="0.982784983050847">
sion in the Plains Guerrillas. The fundamental
frequency also was normalized by semitones;
the male’s reference frequency is 50Hz.
Figure 3 shows that the mean of the top pitch
value in the 1950s’ materials is lower than that
of 1970s’. In the 1955 version, the leading cha-
racter, Speaker A, possesses a mean value of the
top pitch value which is 20.9 semitones. This
value is lower than that of 1975s’ by a differ-
ence of 0.9 semitones. The negative character,
Speaker B, has a mean value of the top pitch
value which is 24.5 semitones in the 1955 ver-
sion. The value in the 1975 version is 27 semi-
tones, with a difference of 2.5 semitones left,
also showing that the value in the 1975 version
is comparatively high. Comparing the data of
the bottom pitch value in the 1955 version with
that in the 1975 version, we know that these
data seem closer than the top pitch value, but
still the higher ones belong to the 1975 version.
That the bottom pitch value is higher tells us
that the whole pitch register is raised.
Furthermore, we can easily see from Figure 3
that the pitch range of the same character in the
1975 version is wider. Speaker A of the 1955
version has a pitch range of 4.8 semitones. In
contrast, the same character in the 1975 version
has a pitch range of 6 semitones. Speaker C of
the 1955 version has 4 semitones pitch range,
but in the 1975 version, he has 5.9 semitones
pitch range. The gap between them is 1.9 semi-
tones. Through this comparison, we find that the
pitch range in the 1975 version is wider than
that in the 1955 version in the whole.
To some extent, the speaking, both the top
pitch value and the bottom pitch value in the
1975 version are higher. This proves that, on the
whole, the pitch of the 1970s’ materials is high-
er and more unnatural than that of 50s’ because
of the effect by the Cultural Revolution era.
And this also proves the feeling of the partici-
pants in the perceptional experiment at section 3
about the 1970s’ materials, that is, the 1970s’
Mandarin has a loud and sonorous voice; the
characters pronounce harder; the general pitch is
higher.
Duration feature: In the respect of duration,
we also compared and analyzed the presenters’
speech on TV in 20053 with the materials ex-
tracted from the movie dialogues the 1955 and
the 1975. Table 7 is the relevant data.
According to table 7, there is a little differ-
ence of the durations mean among them (fol-
lowing four tones), especially it’s very closely
between the 1975 and the 2005, and those of the
1975 version are a few longer than those of the
1955 version. But, except the first tone (Sig.
=.077), the differences of the duration means

Demonstrations of the four-syllable pro-

two four-syllable prosodic words, which are
“bu2 yao4 lu4 mian4” (don’t appear) and “gan4

By observing the above two figures, we find
that the pitch contour of the 1975 and that of the
1955 are almost identical except the latter is
always lower than the former. This may explain
that although the Mandarin has gone through a
hundred years, the pitch pattern is relatively
stable.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

This paper proposes to design a Chinese
Mandarin Digital Multi-modal Corpus
(CMDMC). Through this corpus, the historical
trace of Mandarin development can be followed;
the fresh and alive data and material resources
can be drawn up for the modern researchers and
successors. We also intend to analyze the syn-
tactic correlations of prosodic phrase in broad-
casting news speech, and compare the phonetic
and prosodic features in movie dialogues among
several same-name movies in different histori-
cal eras. The contributions are as follows.
Firstly, the syntactic structure is more com-
plex than the prosodic structure, some conjunc-
tion and particle, such as de0, deng3, he2, dan4
and so on, more likely attached to the end of left
structure or the beginning of right one and form
a prosodic word, if the number of lexical words
mismatch the prosodic words. Otherwise, they
have almost similar structure.
Secondly, the speech of 1970s in last century
is greatly influenced by the special era. People
usually use exaggerated voice, pronounce hard
and raise the pitch unnaturally, giving others a
taste of lecturing and ordering. In contrast, the
speech of Mandarin in 1950s is more natural
and close to the daily life pronunciation and
intonation. Even so, the pitch patterns have no
big changes, and this may explain that the pitch
patterns are comparatively stable in Chinese
Mandarin.
Future research will include treatment of cor-
relation between syntax and prosody within IP
or IG, ideally comparing the diachronic phonet-
ic or prosodic changes in Mandarin by the past
100 years. Additionally, we would like to tackle
the problem of data management, update and
periodical increasing as time passes.

<abstract confidence="0.994733391304348">Modern Chinese Mandarin has gone through near a hundred years, it is very important to store its representative sample in digital form permanently. In this paper, we propose a Chinese Mandarin Digital Multi-modal Corpus (CMDMC), which is a digital speech museum with diachronic, opened, crossmedia and sharable features. It has over 3460 hours video and audio files with metadata tagging. The materials, which were generated by the authoritative speakers (e.g. announcers at TV or radio station) with normality, are required samples if we can get them. Based on this resource, we also intend to analyze the syntactic correlations of prosodic phrase in broadcasting news speech, and compare the phonetic and prosodic features in movie dialogues among several same-name movies in different historical eras.</abstract>
