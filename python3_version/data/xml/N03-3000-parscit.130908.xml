Preface to the Student Research Workshop Proceedings
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999405">
We are pleased to present the proceedings for the Student Research Workshop at HLT/NAACL-03, combin-
ing two conference series, Human Language Technology and the North American chapter of the Associa-
tion for Computational Linguistics. This is the third NAACL student workshop, and the first HLT student
workshop. This year’s workshop presents 10 full-length papers. After each presentation, a panel of senior
researchers will provide detailed comments and feedback on the work. We would like to thank the panelists
in advance.
This year, in keeping with HLT’s wider scope, we encouraged submissions that crossed the boundaries
between computational linguistics, information retrieval, and speech recognition. Our accepted papers rep-
resent all of these research areas. This year, we received 12 papers from 6 countries. Each paper was
reviewed by at least three researchers, at least one student and at least one non-student. Each review con-
tained extensive comments to the author. We would like to thank everyone who submitted to the conference
as well as the members of the Program Committee for their time and extraordinary effort.

We would like to thank Gideon Mann and Alexander Koller, the chairs of the student workshop at ACL-
2002, for sharing their invaluable experience. Marc Light, our faculty advisor has been immensely helpful
in sharing his experience and providing guidance. Finally, we would like to thank the organizers of the main
conference for their help, in particular Eduard Hovy, Mari Ostendorf, Marti Hearst, and Dragomir Radev.
