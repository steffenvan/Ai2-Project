Even though considerable attention has been
given to semantic orientation of words and the
creation of large polarity lexicons, research
in emotion analysis has had to rely on lim-
ited and small emotion lexicons. In this pa-
per, we show how we create a high-quality,
moderate-sized emotion lexicon using Me-
chanical Turk. In addition to questions about
emotions evoked by terms, we show how the
inclusion of a word choice question can dis-
courage malicious data entry, help identify in-
stances where the annotator may not be famil-
iar with the target term (allowing us to reject
such annotations), and help obtain annotations
at sense level (rather than at word level). We
perform an extensive analysis of the annota-
tions to better understand the distribution of
emotions evoked by terms of different parts of
speech. We identify which emotions tend to be
evoked simultaneously by the same term and
show that certain emotions indeed go hand in
hand.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.983538888888889">
When analyzing text, automatically detecting emo-
tions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise is
useful for a number of purposes, including identify-
ing blogs that express specific emotions towards the
topic of interest, identifying what emotion a news-
paper headline is trying to evoke, and devising auto-
matic dialogue systems that respond appropriately to
different emotional states of the user. Often different
emotions are expressed through different words. For
example, delightful and yummy indicate the emo-
tion of joy, gloomy and cry are indicative of sadness,
26
shout and boiling are indicative of anger, and so on.
Therefore an emotion lexicon—a list of emotions
and words that are indicative of each emotion—is
likely to be useful in identifying emotions in text.
Words may evoke different emotions in different
contexts, and the emotion evoked by a phrase or a
sentence is not simply the sum of emotions conveyed
by the words in it, but the emotion lexicon will be a
useful component for any sophisticated emotion de-
tecting algorithm. The lexicon will also be useful for
evaluating automatic methods that identify the emo-
tions evoked by a word. Such algorithms may then
be used to automatically generate emotion lexicons
in languages where no such lexicons exist. As of
now, high-quality high-coverage emotion lexicons
do not exist for any language, although there are a
few limited-coverage lexicons for a handful of lan-
guages, for example, the WordNet Affect Lexicon
(WAL) (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) for six ba-
sic emotions and the General Inquirer (GI) (Stone et
al., 1966), which categorizes words into a number of
categories, including positive and negative semantic
orientation.
Amazon has an online service called Mechani-
cal Turk that can be used to obtain a large amount
of human annotation in an efficient and inexpensive
manner (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009).1
However, one must define the task carefully to ob-
tain annotations of high quality. Several checks must
be placed to ensure that random and erroneous anno-
tations are discouraged, rejected, and re-annotated.
In this paper, we show how we compiled a
moderate-sized English emotion lexicon by manual

annotation through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk ser-
vice. This dataset, which we will call EmoLez, is
many times as large as the only other known emo-
tion lexicon, WordNet Affect Lexicon. More impor-
tantly, the terms in this lexicon are carefully chosen
to include some of the most frequent nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs. Beyond unigrams, it has
a large number of commonly used bigrams. We
also include some words from the General Inquirer
and some from WordNet Affect Lexicon, to allow
comparison of annotations between the various re-
sources.
We perform an extensive analysis of the annota-
tions to answer several questions that have not been
properly addressed so far. For instance, how hard is
it for humans to annotate words with the emotions
they evoke? What percentage of commonly used
terms, in each part of speech, evoke an emotion? Are
emotions more commonly evoked by nouns, verbs,
adjectives, or adverbs? Is there a correlation be-
tween the semantic orientation of a word and the
emotion it evokes? Which emotions tend to go to-
gether; that is, which emotions are evoked simulta-
neously by the same term? This work is intended
to be a pilot study before we create a much larger
emotion lexicon with tens of thousands of terms.
We focus on the emotions of joy, sadness, anger,
fear, trust, disgust, surprise, and anticipation—
argued by many to be the basic and prototypical
emotions (Plutchik, 1980). Complex emotions can
be viewed as combinations of these basic emotions.

WordNet Affect Lexicon (Strapparava and Valitutti,
2004) has a few hundred words annotated with the
emotions they evoke.2 It was created by manually
identifying the emotions of a few seed words and
then marking all their WordNet synonyms as having
the same emotion. The General Inquirer (Stone et
al., 1966) has 11,788 words labeled with 182 cat-
egories of word tags, including positive and nega-

Work in emotion detection can be roughly classi-
fied into that which looks for specific emotion denot-
ing words (Elliott, 1992), that which determines ten-
dency of terms to co-occur with seed words whose
emotions are known (Read, 2004), that which uses
hand-coded rules (Neviarouskaya et al., 2009), and
that which uses machine learning and a number of
emotion features, including emotion denoting words
(Alm et al., 2005).
Much of this recent work focuses on six emo-
tions studied by Ekman (1992). These emotions—
joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise— are
a subset of the eight proposed in Plutchik (1980).
We focus on the Plutchik emotions because the emo-
tions can be naturally paired into opposites—joy–
sadness, anger–fear, trust–disgust, and anticipation-
surprise. Natural symmetry apart, we believe that
prior work on automatically computing word–pair
antonymy (Lin et al., 2003; Mohammad et al., 2008;
Lobanova et al., 2010) can now be leveraged in au-
tomatic emotion detection.

In the subsections below we present the challenges
in obtaining high-quality emotion annotation, how
we address those challenges, how we select the tar-

annotators.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999089">
3.1 Key challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995483125">
Words used in different senses can evoke different
emotions. For example, the word shout evokes a
different emotion when used in the context of ad-
monishment, than when used in “Give me a shout if
you need any help.” Getting human annotations on
word senses is made complicated by decisions about
which sense-inventory to use and what level of gran-
ularity the senses must have. On the one hand, we
do not want to choose a fine-grained sense-inventory
because then the number of word–sense combina-
tions will become too large and difficult to easily
distinguish, and on the other hand we do not want
to work only at the word level because when used
in different senses a word may evoke different emo-
tions.
Yet another challenge is how best to convey a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996434">
27
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999856666666667">
word sense to the annotator. Long definitions will
take time to read and limit the number of annotations
we can obtain for the same amount of resources.
Further, we do not want to bias the annotator to-
wards an emotion through the definition. We want
the users to annotate a word only if they are already
familiar with it and know its meanings. And lastly,
we must ensure that malicious and erroneous anno-
tations are rejected.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999651">
3.2 Our solution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805959183674">
In order to overcome the challenges described
above, before asking the annotators questions about
what emotions are evoked by a target term, we first
present them with a word choice problem pertaining
to the target. They are provided with four different
words and asked which word is closest in meaning
to the target. This single question serves many pur-
poses. Through this question we convey the word
sense for which annotations are to be provided, with-
out actually providing annotators with long defini-
tions. If an annotator is not familiar with the target
word and still attempts to answer questions pertain-
ing to the target, or is randomly clicking options in
our questionnaire, then there is a 75% chance that
they will get the answer to this question wrong, and
we can discard all responses pertaining to this target
term by the annotator (that is, we discard answers to
the emotion questions provided by the annotator for
this target term).
We generated these word choice problems auto-
matically using the Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard,
1986). Published thesauri, such as Roget’s and Mac-
quarie, divide the vocabulary into about a thou-
sand categories, which may be interpreted as coarse
senses. If a word has more than one sense, then it
can be found in more than one thesaurus category.
Each category also has a head word which best cap-
tures the meaning of the category.
Most of the target terms chosen for annotation are
restricted to those that are listed in exactly one the-
saurus category. The word choice question for a
target term is automatically generated by selecting
the following four alternatives (choices): the head
word of the thesaurus category pertaining to the tar-
get term (the correct answer); and three other head
words of randomly selected categories (the distrac-
tors). The four alternatives are presented to the an-
notator in random order.
Only a small number of the words in the WordNet
Affect Lexicon are listed in exactly one thesaurus
category (have one sense), and so we included tar-
get terms that occurred in two thesaurus categories
as well. For these questions, we listed head words
from both the senses (categories) as two of the alter-
natives (probability of a random choice being cor-
rect is 50%). Depending on the alternative chosen,
we can thus determine the sense for which the sub-
sequent emotion responses are provided by the an-
notator.

3.3 Target terms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999710393939394">
In order to generate an emotion lexicon, we first
identify a list of words and phrases for which we
want human annotations. We chose the Macquarie
Thesaurus as our source pool for unigrams and bi-
grams. Any other published dictionary would have
worked well too. However, apart from over 57,000
commonly used English word types, the Macquarie
Thesaurus also has entries for more than 40,000
commonly used phrases. From this list of unigrams
and bigrams we chose those that occur frequently in
the Google n-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006).
Specifically we chose the 200 most frequent n-grams
in the following categories: noun unigrams, noun
bigrams, verb unigrams, verb bigrams, adverb un-
igrams, adverb bigrams, adjective unigrams, adjec-
tive bigrams, words in the General Inquirer that are
marked as having a negative semantic orientation,
words in General Inquirer that are marked as hav-
ing a positive semantic orientation. When selecting
these sets, we ignored terms that occurred in more
than one Macquarie Thesaurus category. Lastly, we
chose all words from each of the six emotion cat-
egories in the WordNet Affect Lexicon that had at
most two senses in the thesaurus (occurred in at
most two thesaurus categories). The first and sec-
ond column of Table 1 list the various sets of tar-
get terms as well as the number of terms in each set
for which annotations were requested. EmoLexUni
stands for all the unigrams taken from the thesaurus.
EmoLexBi refers to all the bigrams. EmoLexGI
are all the words taken from the General Inquirer.
EmoLexWAL are all the words taken from the Word-
Net Affect Lexicon.

3.4 Mechanical Turk HITs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.943052909090909">
An entity submitting a task to Mechanical Turk is
called the requester. A requester first breaks the
task into small independently solvable units called
HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) and uploads
them on the Mechanical Turk website. The requester
specifies the compensation that will be paid for solv-
ing each HIT. The people who provide responses to
these HITs are called Turkers. The requester also
specifies the number of different Turkers that are
to annotate each HIT. The annotation provided by
a Turker for a HIT is called an assignment.
We created Mechanical Turk HITs for each of the
terms specified in Table 1. Each HIT has a set of
questions, all of which are to be answered by the
same person. We requested five different assign-
ments for each HIT (each HIT is to be annotated
by five different Turkers). Different HITS may be
attempted by different Turkers, and a Turker may
attempt as many HITs as they wish. Below is an
example HIT for the target word “startle”.

The first set of emotion annotations on Mechanical
Turk were completed in about nine days. The Turk-
ers spent a minute on average to answer the ques-

slightly more than $2.

Once the assignments were collected, we used au-
tomatic scripts to validate the annotations. Some as-
signments were discarded because they failed cer-
tain tests (described below). A subset of the dis-
carded assignments were officially rejected (the
Turkers were not paid for these assignments) be-
cause instructions were not followed. About 500 of
the 10,880 assignments (2,176 x 5) included at least
one unanswered question. These assignments were
discarded and rejected. More than 85% of the re-
maining assignments had the correct answer for the
word choice question. This was a welcome result
showing that, largely, the annotations were done in
a responsible manner. We discarded all assignments
that had the wrong answer for the word choice ques-
tion. If an annotator obtained an overall score that
is less than 66.67% on the word choice questions
(that is, got more than one out of three wrong), then
we assumed that, contrary to instructions, HITs for
words not familiar to the annotator were attempted.
We discarded and rejected all assignments by such
annotators (not just the assignments for which they
got the word choice question wrong).
HITs pertaining to all the discarded assignments
were uploaded for a second time on Mechanical
Turk and the validation process was repeated. Af-
ter the second round, we had three or more valid as-
signments for 2081 of the 2176 target terms. We will
refer to this set of assignments as the master set. We
create the emotion lexicon from this master set con-
taining 9892 assignments from about 1000 Turkers
who attempted 1 to 450 assignments each. About
100 of them provided 20 or more assignments each
(more than 7000 assignments in all). The master set
has, on average, about 4.75 assignments for each of
the 2081 target terms. (See Table 1 for more details.)

<bodyText confidence="0.999669">
Table 4 shows that a sizable percent of nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs are evocative. Adverbs and
adjectives are some of the most emotion inspiring
terms and this is not surprising considering that they
are used to qualify a noun or a verb. Anticipation,
trust, and joy come through as the most common
emotions evoked by terms of all four parts of speech.
The EmoLexWAL rows are particularly interest-
ing because they serve to determine how much
the Turker annotations match annotations in the
Wordnet Affect Lexicon (WAL). The most common
Turker-determined emotion for each of these rows is
marked in bold. Observe that WAL anger terms are
mostly marked as anger evocative, joy terms as joy
evocative, and so on. The EmoLexWAL rows also
indicate which emotions get confused for which, or
which emotions tend to be evoked simultaneously
by a term. Observe that anger terms tend also to be
evocative of disgust. Similarly, fear and sadness go
together, as do joy, trust, and anticipation.
The EmoLexGI rows rightly show that words
marked as negative in the General Inquirer, mostly
evoke negative emotions (anger, fear, disgust, and
sadness). Observe that the percentages for trust and
joy are much lower. On the other hand, positive
words evoke anticipation, joy, and trust.

4.1.2 Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987625">
In order to analyze how often the annotators agreed
with each other, for each term–emotion pair, we cal-
culated the percentage of times the majority class
has size 5 (all Turkers agree), size 4 (all but one
agree), size 3, and size 2. Observe that for more than
50% of the terms, at least four annotators agree with
each other. Table 5 presents these agreement values.
Since many NLP systems may rely only on two in-
tensity values (evocative or non-evocative), we also
calculate agreement at that level (Table 6). Observe
that for more than 50% of the terms, all five annota-
tors agree with each other, and for more than 80%
of the terms, at least four annotators agree. This
shows a high degree of agreement on emotion anno-
tations despite no real control over the educational
background and qualifications of the annotators.

<bodyText confidence="0.999838555555556">
We consolidate the semantic orientation (polarity)
annotations in a manner identical to the process for
emotion annotations. Table 7 lists the percent of
2081 target terms assigned a majority class of no,
weak, moderate, and strong semantic orientation.
For example, it tells us that 16% of the target terms
are strongly negative. The last row in the table lists
the percent of target terms that have some semantic
orientation (positive or negative) at the various in-
tensity levels. Observe that 35% of the target terms
are strongly evaluative (positively or negatively).
Just as in the case for emotions, practical NLP ap-
plications often require only two levels of seman-
tic orientation—having particular semantic orienta-
tion or not (evaluative) or not (non-evaluative). For
each target term–emotion pair, we convert the four-
level semantic orientation annotations into two-level
ones, just as we did for the emotions. Table 8 gives

4.2.1 Analysis and discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999898">
Observe in Table 9 that, across the board, a sizable
number of terms are evaluative with respect to some
semantic orientation. Interestingly unigram nouns
have a markedly lower proportion of negative terms,
and a much higher proportion of positive terms. It
may be argued that the default semantic orientation
of noun concepts is positive, and that usually it takes
a negative adjective to make the phrase negative.
The EmoLexGI rows in the two tables show that
words marked as having a negative semantic orien-
tation in the General Inquirer are mostly marked as
negative by the Turkers. And similarly, the positives
in GI are annotated as positive. Again, this is con-
firmation that the quality of annotation obtained is
high. The EmoLexWAL rows show that anger, dis-
gust, fear, and sadness terms tend not to have a posi-
tive semantic orientation and are mostly negative. In
contrast, and expectedly, the joy terms are positive.
The surprise terms are more than twice as likely to
be positive than negative.

We showed how Mechanical Turk can be used to
create a high-quality, moderate-sized, emotion lex-
icon for a very small cost (less than US$500). No-
tably, we used automatically generated word choice
questions to detect and reject erroneous annotations
and to reject all annotations by unqualified Turkers
and those who indulge in malicious data entry. We
compared a subset of our lexicon with existing gold
standard data to show that the annotations obtained
are indeed of high quality. A detailed analysis of the

lexicon revealed insights into how prevalent emotion
bearing terms are among common unigrams and bi-
grams. We also identified which emotions tend to be
evoked simultaneously by the same term. The lexi-
con is available for free download.4
Since this pilot experiment with about 2000 target
terms was successful, we will now obtain emotion
annotations for tens of thousands of English terms.
We will use the emotion lexicon to identify emo-
tional tone of larger units of text, such as newspaper
headlines and blog posts. We will also use it to eval-
uate automatically generated lexicons, such as the
polarity lexicons by Turney and Littman (2003) and
Mohammad et al. (2009). We will explore the vari-
ance in emotion evoked by near-synonyms, and also
how common it is for words with many meanings to
evoke different emotions in different senses.

<abstract confidence="0.995976478260869">Even though considerable attention has been given to semantic orientation of words and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons. In this paper, we show how we create a high-quality, moderate-sized emotion lexicon using Mechanical Turk. In addition to questions about emotions evoked by terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We perform an extensive analysis of the annotations to better understand the distribution of emotions evoked by terms of different parts of speech. We identify which emotions tend to be evoked simultaneously by the same term and show that certain emotions indeed go hand in hand.</abstract>

However, apart from over 57,000 commonly used English word types, the Macquarie Thesaurus also has entries for more than 40,000 commonly used phrases. From this list of unigrams and bigrams we chose those that occur frequently in the Google n-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006). Specifically we chose the 200 most frequent n-grams in the following categories: noun unigrams, noun bigrams, verb unigrams, verb bigrams, adverb unigrams, adverb bigrams, adjective unigrams, adjective bigrams, words in the General Inquirer that are marked as having a negative semantic orientation, words in General Inquirer that are marked as having a positive semantic orientation.

Amazon has an online service called Mechanical Turk that can be used to obtain a large amount of human annotation in an efficient and inexpensive manner (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009).1 However, one must define the task carefully to obtain annotations of high quality.

Much of this recent work focuses on six emotions studied by Ekman (1992). These emotions— joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise— are a subset of the eight proposed in Plutchik (1980). We focus on the Plutchik emotions because the emotions can be naturally paired into opposites—joy– sadness, anger–fear, trust–disgust, and anticipationsurprise. Natural symmetry apart, we believe that prior work on automatically computing word–pair antonymy (Lin et al., 2003; Mohammad et al., 2008; Lobanova et al., 2010) can now be leveraged in automatic emotion detection. 3 Emotion annotation In the subsections below we present the challenges in obtaining high-quality emotion annotation, how we address those challenges, how we select the target terms, and the questionnaire we created for the annotators. 3.1 Key challenges Words used in different senses can evoke different emotions. For example, the word shout evokes a different emotion when used in the context of admonishment, than when used in “Give me a shout if you need any help.” Getting human annotations on word senses is made co</context>
