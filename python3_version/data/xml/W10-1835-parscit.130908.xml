Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987775">
E-Dictor is a tool for encoding, applying
levels of editions, and assigning part-of-
speech tags to ancient texts. In short, it
works as a WYSIWYG interface to en-
code text in XML format. It comes from
the experience during the building of the
Tycho Brahe Parsed Corpus of Historical
Portuguese and from consortium activities
with other research groups. Preliminary
results show a decrease of at least 50% on
the overall time taken on the editing pro-
cess.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999149375">
The Tycho Brahe Parsed Corpus of Historical Por-
tuguese (CTB) (Cor, 2010) consists of Portuguese
texts written by authors born between 1380 and
1845. Been one of the forefront works among
projects dedicated to investigate the history of Por-
tuguese language, it contributed to the renovation
of the theoretical relevance of studies about the
linguistic change in different frameworks (Mat-
tos e Silva, 1988; Kato and Roberts, 1993; de
Castilho, 1998).
This resulted in crescent work with ancient texts
in the country (Megale and Cambraia, 1999), and,
by the end of the 1990s, the work on Corpus Lin-
guistics has given rise to a confluence between
philology and computer science, a relationship not
so ease to equate.

In studies based on ancient texts, above all, one

recognition (OCR). For the older texts, however,
the current recognition technologies have proven
inefficient and quite inadequate for handwritten
documents (Paixão de Sousa, 2009). Anyway one
cannot totally avoid manual transcription.
There are different degrees of fidelity between
the transcription and the original text. In prac-
tice, one often prepares a “semi-diplomatic” edi-
tion, in which a slightly greater degree of interfer-
ence is considered acceptable – eg., typographical
or graphematic modernization. A central goal of
the philological edition is to make the text accessi-
ble to the specialist reader, with maximum preser-
vation of its original features.
However, it needs to be integrated with compu-
tational and linguistic requirements: the need for
quantity, agility and automation in the statistical
work of selecting data. The original spelling and
graphematic characteristics of older texts, for ex-
ample, may hinder the subsequent automatic pro-
cessing, such as morphological annotation. Thus,
the original text needs to be prepared, or edited,
with a degree of interference higher than that ac-
ceptable for a semi-diplomatic edition and that is
where the conflict emerges.

1.2 Background
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999796">
The modernization of spellings and standardiza-
tion of graphematic aspects, during the first years
of CTB, made texts suitable for automated pro-
cessing, but caused the loss of important features
from the original text for the historical study of
language. This tension has led to the project
“Memories of the Text” (Paixão de Sousa, 2004),
which sought to restructure the Corpus, based
on the development of XML annotations (W3C,
2009), and to take advantage of the core features of
this type of encoding, for example, XSLT (W3C,
1999) processing.
A annotation system was conceived and applied
to 48 Portuguese texts (2, 279, 455 words), which

Uppsala, Sweden, 15-16 July 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics
allowed keeping philological informations while
making the texts capable of being computationally
treated in large-scale. Since 2006, the system has
been being tested by other research groups, no-
tably the Program for the History of Portuguese
Language (PROHPOR-UFBA). The system, then,
met its initial objectives, but it had serious issues
with respect to reliability and, especially, ease of
use.
We noted that manual text markup in XML
was challenging to some and laborious for every-
one. The basic edition process was: transcription
in a text editor, application of the XML markup
(tags plus philological edition), generation of a
standardized plain text version to submit to auto-
matic part-of-speech tagging, revision of both files
(XML and tagged). All in this process, except for
text tagging, been manually done, was too subject
to failures and demanded constant and extensive
revision of the encoding. The need for an alter-
native, to make the task more friendly, reliable,
and productive, became clear. In short, two things
were needed: a friendly interface (WYSIWYG),
to prevent the user from dealing with XML code,
and a way to tighten the whole process (transcrip-
tion, encode/edition, POS tagging and revision).

Unfortunately, all the cited tools lack the ca-
pability of dealing proper with levels of edition
for tokens (words and punctuations) and an inte-
grated environment for the whole process of edi-
tion. Thus, in spite of their amazing features, none
of them was sufficiently suitable, specially con-
cerning spelling modernization and normalization
of graphematic aspects. In fact, this is expected

As shown in Figure 1, the main interface has an
application menu, a toolbar, a content area (di-

The tabs are in accordance with the flow of the en-
coding process. Many aspects of the functioning
described in what follows are determined by the
application preferences.
In the ‘Transcription’ tab, the original text
is transcribed “as is” (the user can view the
fac-simile image, while transcribing the text).
Throught a menu option, E-Dictor will automat-

The XML structure specified meets two main
goals: (i) be as neutral as possible (in relation to
the textual content encoded) and (ii) suit philolog-
ical and linguistic needs, i.e., edition must be sim-
ple and efficient without losing information rele-
vant to philological studies. In the context of CTB,
it was initially established a structure to encode the
following information:

• Metadata: information about the source text,
e.g., author information, state of processing,
etc.
• Delimitation of sections, pages, paragraphs,

• Class of tokens (part-of-speech tags) and
phonological form for some tokens.
• Types (levels) of edition for each token.
• Comments of the editor.
• Subtypes for some text elements, like sec-

2.4 Encoding flexibility

A key goal of E-Dictor is to be flexible enough so
as to be useful in other contexts of corpora build-
ing. To achieve this, the user can customize the
“preferences” of the application. The most promi-
nent options are the levels of edition for tokens; the
subtypes for the elements ‘section’, ‘paragraph’,
‘sentence’, and ‘token’; and the list of POS tags to
be used in the morphological analysis. Finally, in
the ’Metadata’ tab, the user can create the suitable
metadata fields needed by his/her project.

particular options intended for the encoding pro-
cess (XML structure generation, POS automatic
tagging, etc.). E-Dictor provides also an option

specify the type of the token (according to the sub-
types defined by the preferences), its foreign lan-
guage, and format (bold, italic, and underlined);
(ii) in the “Edition” panel, specify some other
properties (eg., phonological form) of the token
and include edition levels (according to the levels
defined by the preferences).
To each token, the user must click on “Apply
changes” to effectivate (all) the editions made to it.
The option “Replace all” tells E-Dictor to repeat
the operation over all identical tokens in the re-
maining of the text (a similar functionality is avail-
able for POS tags revision).

3 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999802086956522">
The dificulties of encoding ancient texts in XML,
using common text editors, had shown that a tool
was necessary to make the process efficient and
friendly. This led to the development of E-Dictor,
which, since its earlier usage, has shown promis-
ing results. Now, the user does not even have to
know that the underlying encoding is XML. It is
only necessary for him/her to know the (philolog-
ical and linguistics) aspects of text edition.
E-Dictor led to a decrease of about 50% in the
time required for encoding and editing texts. The
improvement may be even higher if we consider
the revision time. One of the factors for this im-
provement is the better legibility the tool provides.
The XML code is hidden, allowing one to prac-
tically read the text without any encoding. To il-
lustrate the opposite, Figure 3 shows the common
edition “interface”, before E-Dictor. Note that the
content being edited is just “Ex.mo Sr. Duque”.
Finally, the integration of the whole process into
one and only environment is a second factor for the
overall improvement, for it allows the user to move
freely and quickly between “representations” and

3.1 Improvements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973">
E-Dictor is always under development, as we dis-
cuss its characteristics and receive feedback from
users. There is already a list of future improve-
ments that are being developed, such as extending
the exporting routines, for example. A bigger goal
is to incorporate an edition lexicon, which would
be used by the tool for making suggestions during
the edition process, or even to develop an “auto-
matic token edition” system for later revision by
the user.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992931">
3.2 Perspectives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998264">
Besides CTB, E-Dictor is being used by the BBD
project (BBD, 2010), and, recently, by various
subgroups of the PHPB project (For a History of
Portuguese in Brazil). These groups have large
experience in philological edition of handwritten
documents, and we hope their use of E-Dictor will
help us improve it. The ideal goal of E-Dictor is to
be capable of handling the whole flow of linguistic
and philological tasks: transcription, edition, tag-
ging, and parsing.
