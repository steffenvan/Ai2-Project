This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the ACL-SIGLEX 2005 Workshop on
Deep Lexical Acquisition, held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA, on the 30th of June,
2005.
This workshop is supported by SIGLEX, the Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association
for Computational Linguistics (http://www.clres.com/siglex.html). Its goal is to bring
together researchers interested in different facets of the automatic acquisition of deep lexical
information, e.g. in the areas of computational grammars, computational lexicography, machine
translation, information retrieval, question-answering, and text mining.
Deep lexical resources include lexicons for linguistically-precise grammars, template sets for
information extraction systems, and ontologies for word sense disambiguation. Such resources
are critical for enhancing the performance of systems and for improving their portability between
domains. Most deep lexical resources in current use have been developed manually by lexicographers
at considerable cost, and yet have limited coverage and require labour-intensive porting to new
tasks. Automatic lexical acquisition is a more promising and cost-effective approach to take, and
is increasingly viable given recent advances in NLP and machine learning technology, and corpus
availability. However, a number of important challenges still need addressing before benefits can
be reaped in practical language engineering, such as the (multilingual) acquisition of deep lexical
information from corpora and the implementation of accurate, large-scale, portable acquisition
techniques.
In the call for papers we solicited papers describing aspects of deep lexical acquisition including:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999118272727273">
• Automatic acquisition of deep lexical information: subcategorization, diathesis alternations,
selectional preferences, lexical/semantic classes, qualia structure, lexical ontologies, semantic
roles, word senses, etc.
• Methods for supervised, unsupervised and weakly supervised deep lexical acquisition: machine
learning, statistical, example- or rule-based, hybrid etc.
• Large-scale, cross-domain, domain-specific and portable deep lexical acquisition
• Extending and refining existing lexical resources with automatically acquired information
• Evaluation of deep lexical acquisition
• Application of deep lexical acquisition to NLP applications (e.g. machine translation, information
extraction, language generation, question-answering)
• Multilingual deep lexical acquisition
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.913426533333333">
Of the 22 papers submitted, the programme committee selected 11 papers for publication, representative
of the state of the art in this subject today. Each full-length submission was independently reviewed
iii
by three members of the program committee, who then collectively faced the difficult task of selecting
a subset of papers for publication from a very strong field. The accepted papers include proposals for
automatic annotation and extension of deep lexical resources, and methods for automatically acquiring
deep lexical information. Languages targeted in the papers include English, Chinese, Japanese and
Catalan.
We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, as well as the members of the program
committee for the time and effort they contributed in reviewing the papers, and Chris Brew for
complementing the workshop expertly with his invited talk. Our thanks go also to the organisers of the
main conference, the publication chairs (Jason Eisner and Philipp K¨ohn) and the conference workshop
committee (Mark Dras, Mary Harper, Dan Klein, Mirella Lapata and Shuly Wintner).
