This paper proposes an interactive rewriting tool
for supporting people in creating machine acceptable
sentences. The experiment and evaluation of this tool
conducted when applied to a pre-editing support tool
in a Japanese-to-English machine translation
(henceforth, MT) system are also described.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938333333333">
Supporting people in creating machine acceptable
sentences is one important issue of future NLP appli-
cations. Agents in computers will be able to provide
people with a variety of services by grasping the con-
tents of documents. An intelligent mail server, for
example, can read mails and send appropriate replies
semi or fully automatically if the mails are machine
acceptable. This is a natural extension of the ideas
explored in the object lens(Malone, Grant, Lai, Rao
and Rosenblitt,1986).
However, it is difficult for humans to write in
machine acceptable forms because of gaps between
humans and machines First, humans use semantics,
context and common sense in interpreting a sentence,
while limited resources are available to machines. Sec-
ond, unlike machines, humans cannot simulate
sentence analysis process in a machine to check all pos-
sibilities. As such, man-machine corporation would be
one solution with the least burdens on humans.
Prior to a general-purpose rewriting tool, we have
been developing a pre-editing support tool for an MT
system(Hirakawa,Nogami and Amano,1991). Since
our central concern is to analyze human-computer
interaction for creating machine acceptable sentences,
MT systems for bilingual and monolingual users are
closely related to our tool. Considering that the dif-
ficulty of interactive systems lies in &amp;quot;so many
interactions for a single sentence,&amp;quot; (Hutchins and
Somers, 1992) we need a framework which produces
the best result with least interactions.

2.1 Design Principles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954485666666667">
The problems of rewriting include difficulties in
learning its know-how and unpredictable effects of
rewriting. The following are our design principles:
1) Interaction-based system: Since rewriting is a
dynamic process, the process should be interactive to
deal with changes.

2) Presentation of rewriting candidates: The system
should present possible recommended revisions to
users so that they can select the best choice and guar-
antee the correctness of the rewriting.
3) Minimization of interactions: To minimin fre-
quencies of interactions in rewriting, the system
should fully utilize knowledge available to improve
the accuracy of the diagnoses.
4) Optimization of interactions: Scales to measure the
degree of rewriting(scalability) should be introduced
to optimize interactions to obtain the maximum
effects with minimum interactions.

2.2 System Configuration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997843230769231">
The system consists of two main parts: a sentence
checker and a user interface unit
The sentence checker is composed of a sentence ana-
lyzer, an information extractor and a rewriting
candidate generator. The information extractor
extracts the information necessary for rewriting, such
as morphological and syntactic information, from the
analysis results of an MT system, to detect problem-
atic phrases and generate recommended rewriting
examples along with guidance messages to help users
with rewriting.
The user interface displays the original sentences
which require correction with their recommended

they are presented to users in order of importance.
Knowledge for rewriting is accumulated as rules
for the information extractor, which is actually a gen-
eral-purpose information extracting tool-kit equipped
with overall linguistic analyzing modules and infor-
mation extracting/diagnosing modules.

3. Knowledge for Rewriting Long Sentences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947">
Of those Japanese expressions that need rewriting
before machine translation, long sentences which
should be divided into shorter ones are the most
important, as shown in previous studies(Kim, Ehara
and Aizawa, 1992).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970683">
3.1 Criteria for Detecting Long Sentences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999947">
It is empirically known that simple factors, such
as the number of characters or words in a sentence, are
not sufficient to determine which sentences should be
rewritten. Currently, we adopt both the number of
words and the linguistic patterns to identify long sen-
tences. This combined algorithm provides the
precision ratio of 52% and the recall ratio of 96% for
closed data. The two ratios improved by 9% and 6%
respectively, compared with the case when the number
of words in a sentence is the only determining factor.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999976">
3.2 Generation of Rewriting Candidates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963643666666667">
The rewriting rules also generate candidates for
rewriting expressions. There are four methods of sen-
tence division:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.787021818181818">
1) Simple division (60%): A sentence is divided into
two at the division point inflecting the ending of
the first sentence and inserting an appropriate con-
nective at the beginning of the second sentence,
where necessary.
2) Supplementation of case fillers (27%): A case,
such as the subjective case, is supplemented after
sentence division.
3) Supplementation of verbs (7%): Verbs are supple-
mented after sentence division.
4) Others (6%):
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.962007333333333">
Of the above, method 1) has been implemented and
method 2) is under development using semantic trees
provided by the information extractor.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.745711" genericHeader="evaluation">
4. Experiment and Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991175">
The rewriting tool has been evaluated from two
aspects: the knowledge which forms the basis of our
pre-editing rules and the tool as a whole, including
the interface.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999954">
4.1 Evaluation of Rewriting Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990333333333">
We have carried out an experiment on the evalua-
tion of our rewriting knowledge using a new test
text(211 sentences). The experiment showed almost
the same result(62% for the precision ratio and 90%
for the recall ratio) as is in Section 3.1.
To evaluate the generation of rewriting candidates
in temis of rewriting positions and rewriting expres-
sions, the precision ratio and the recall ratio of these
two have been calculated for the target text, focusing
on the sentences for which the tool produced rewrit-
ing candidates (i.e., type 1) in Section 3.2.
The precision ratio and the recall ratio for identi-
fying division points are 63% and 100% respectively;
the ratios for the rewriting candidates are 105% and
93% respectively. The recall ratios for both division
points and rewriting expressions exceed 90%, which
means that the probability of obtaining the correct
positions and candidates are sufficiently high. The pre-
cision ratio for substitution generation is low, but 5
to 6 candidates per division point would not be much
of a burden on the user.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998534">
4.2 Evaluation of the Operating Cost
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994588235294">
A preliminary experiment was made on five sub-
jects to evaluate an overall appraisal, including the
interface, the rate of reduction in operation time and
improvement in the quality of rewriting.
The rate of reduction in rewriting time for the
five subjects averages 23%. The recall ratio went up
from 83% to 96%, the precision ratio from 96% to
99%. For those subjects whose recall ratio scored
high when the tool was not used, the rate of reduc-
tion in time also tends to be high. For others whose
recall ratio is low when the tool was not used, the
rate of reduction in time does not change much, but
the recall ratio improved by far. That is, users capa-
ble of rewriting without outside help can further
shorten the total time using the tool. Moreover,
those with low rewriting skills can benefit from the
tool to improve rewriting quality.

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999360333333333">
We have proposed an interactive rewriting tool
featuring the rewriting candidate generation capabili-
ties to support people in creating machine acceptable
sentences. This tool has been applied to MT pre-edit-
ing in a Japanese-to-English MT system and showed
promising results in the experimental evaluations.
