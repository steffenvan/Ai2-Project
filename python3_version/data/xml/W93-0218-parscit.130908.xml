I am currently leading a small research project. on discourse-level processing for a Japanese-English
interpreting telephone system. The interpreting telephone (IT) would allow monolingual speakers
of different languages to carry on a spoken conversation. The dialogue management task faced by
the Yrs discourse component, defines unique constraints on the overall IT software system.
The dialogue manager must model five distinct dialogue interactions that arise during operation of
the larger IT system.
( I) the human-human (bilingual) dialogue that constitutes the primary data for the system,
(2),(3) two human-machine (monolingual) dialogues, each of which alternates input speech of one
speaker with the translated output. of the other speaker&apos;s input, and
(4),(5) two human-machine dialogues that occur whenever the interpreting telephone system itself
(or a component. of it, such as the dialogue manager) engages either of the humans in a. meta-dialogue
to address any disruption for the flow of the primary (human-human) dialogue.
The role of intentions in the IT system varies with the role of the dialogue manager. In processing
dialogues of Types 4 and 5, the IT is acting as an agent in a private dialogue with one of the users.
It. must discern the user&apos;s plan and (dynamically) construct and execute its own plan for repairing
the dialogue error condition in collaboration with the user. The IT system can influence the user&apos;s
behavior and intentions through its own behavior.
In contrast, in dialogues of Types 2 and 3 the IT dialogue manager acts as a third-party observer
of the human-human bilingual dialogue. The dialogue manager&apos;s task is to recognize the evolving
plans of the two users in order to analyze source-language utterances adequately for carrying out
translation, and in order to make decisions during generation of target-language utterances that
reflect the source-language speaker&apos;s intentions.
The two users may have shared experience that extends beyond the current conversation. They may,
therefore, have intentions that are mutually accessible but not. available to the dialogue manager.
For instance, these two users may have spoken on the previous day and may now make context-
dependent. reference to the extended context. begun in an earlier dialogue, &amp;quot;Lets go back to the
second suggestion we discussed yesterday.&amp;quot; This requires a. local definition of intentions at the level
of the immediate dialogue segment that the dialogue manager has access to.

The ultimate success of the IT system is measured by its ability to create the experience, for each
of the two users, of a monolingual dialogue in their own language. Intentions in translation could
be viewed as an automatic side-effect of a good translation. I propose instead that., for the purposes
of bilingual telephone dialogues, intentions are what get preserved under translation. Using two
intention recognizers, one for Japanese and one for English, the dialogue manager will examine
a set of alternative translations and filter those that appear not to realize the intentions of the
source-language speaker.
These five dialogue types can be represented using an adaptation of the three-tiered discourse repre-
sentation (defined in my dissertation) that distinguishes three types of information accessed by the
discourse interpreter during dialogue processing: linguistic, discourse, and belief information. The
framework models the five IT dialogues in parallel, but minimizes redundancy and computational
effort through the use of shared structures. A prototype dialogue manager module is currently under
development in our group. The sample dialogues for the immediate system development involve a
highly restricted domain (conference registration) which defines a. very small library of tasks and
goals from which to choose. My primary interest in this workshop is in the evidence for intentions
for machine translation and a. classification of intention types for the various IT dialogues.
