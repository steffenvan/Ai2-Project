Preface to the Student Research Workshop Proceedings
On behalf of the Program Committee, we are pleased to present the proceedings of the Stu-
dent Research Workshop at ACL-03, the 41st Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics in Sapporo, Japan. This is the fourth time that the Student Session at ACL is
organized in the form of a workshop, and it is the 13th ACL Student Session. This year, the
Student Research Workshop hosts 12 presentations of high-quality full-length papers. After
each presentation, a panel of senior researchers will provide detailed comments and feedback
on the work. We would like to thank the panelists in advance.
This year, we received 31 submissions from 15 different countries. The submissions were gen-
erally on a very high standard, which made the reviewing and selection process quite difficult.
We would like to thank everyone who submitted to the workshop. We would also like to thank
the Program Committee for their time and effort as well as for their valuable comments.

We would like to thank Alexander Koller and Gideon Mann, the chairs of the Student Re-
search Workshop at ACL-NAACL 2002 in Pittsburgh, PA, for sharing with us their invaluable
experience. We would also like to thank Malte Gabsdil, the co-chair of the Student Research
Workshop at EACL 2003 in Budapest, Hungary, for providing us with an electronic submission
system, which helped us immensely with the submission process. Our deep gratitude goes to
Chris Brew, our faculty advisor, for his constant and reliable guidance and for securing student
funding. Finally, we would like to thank the officers from ACL and the conference organizers
for their help, in particular Kenji Araki, Sandra Carberry, Erhard Hinrichs, Sadao Kurohashi,
Kathy McCoy, Masaki Murata, John Nerbonne, Dan Roth, Jun-ichi Tsujii, Eiko Yamamoto,
