UMLS::Similarity is freely available open
source software that allows a user to mea-
sure the semantic similarity or relatedness of
biomedical terms found in the Unified Medi-
cal Language System (UMLS). It is written in
Perl and can be used via a command line in-
terface, an API, or a Web interface.

<bodyText confidence="0.999645904761905">
UMLS::Similarity1 implements a number of seman-
tic similarity and relatedness measures that are based
on the structure and content of the Unified Medical
Language System. The UMLS is a data warehouse
that provides a unified view of many medical termi-
nologies, ontologies and other lexical resources, and
is also freely available from the National Library of
Medicine.2
Measures of semantic similarity quantify the de-
gree to which two terms are similar based on their
proximity in an is-a hierarchy. These measures are
often based on the distance between the two con-
cepts and their common ancestor. For example, lung
disease and Goodpasture’s Syndrome share the con-
cept disease as a common ancestor. Or in general
English, scalpel and switchblade would be consid-
ered very similar since both are nearby descendents
of the concept knife.
However, concepts that are not technically similar
can still be very closely related. For example, Good-
pasture’s Syndrome and Doxycycline are not similar

since they do not have a nearby common ancestor,
but they are very closely related since Doxycycline
is a possible treatment for Goodpasture’s Syndrome.
A more general example might be elbow and arm,
while they are not similar, an elbow is a part-of an
arm and is therefore very closely related. Measures
of relatedness quantify these types of relationships
by using information beyond that which is found
in an is-a hierarchy, which the UMLS contains in
abundance.

Measures of semantic similarity and relatedness
have been used in a number of different biomedi-
cal and clinical applications. Early work relied on
the Gene Ontology (GO)3, which is a hierarchy of
terms used to describe genomic information. For
example, (Lord et al., 2003) measured the similar-
ity of gene sequence data and used this in an appli-
cation for conducting semantic searches of textual
resources. (Guo et al., 2006) used semantic simi-
larity measures to identify direct and indirect pro-
tein interactions within human regulatory pathways.
(N´ev´eol et al., 2006) used semantic similarity mea-
sures based on MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)4
to evaluate automatic indexing of biomedical arti-
cles by measuring the similarity between their rec-
ommended terms and the gold standard index terms.
UMLS::Similarity was first released in 2009, and
since that time has been used in various different
applications. (Sahay and Ram, 2010) used it in a

health information search and recommendation sys-
tem. (Zhang et al., 2011) used the measures to
identify redundancy within clinical records, while
(Mathur and Dinakarpandian, 2011) used them to
help identify similar diseases. UMLS::Similarity
has also enabled the development and evaluation
of new measures by allowing them to be compared
to existing methods, e.g., (Pivovarov and Elhadad,
2012). Finally, UMLS::Similarity can serve as a
building block in other NLP systems, for exam-
ple UMLS::SenseRelate (McInnes et al., 2011) is a
word sense disambiguation system for medical text
based on semantic similarity and relatedness.

UMLS::Similarity is a descendent of Word-
Net::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004), which
implements various measures of similarity and
relatedness for WordNet.5 However, the structure,
nature, and size of the UMLS is quite different from
WordNet, and the adaptations from WordNet were
not always straightforward. One very significant
difference, for example, is that the UMLS is stored
in a MySQL database while WordNet has its own
customized storage format. As a result, the core
of UMLS::Similarity is different and offers a
great deal of functionality specific to the UMLS.
Table 1 lists the measures currently provided in
UMLS::Similarity (as of version 1.27).
The Web interface provides a subset of the func-
tionality offered by the API and command line inter-
face, and allows a user to utilize UMLS::Similarity
without requiring the installation of the UMLS
(which is an admittedly time–consuming process).

The UMLS is a data warehouse that includes over
100 different biomedical and clinical data resources.
One of the largest individual sources is the System-
atized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms
(SNOMED CT), a comprehensive terminology cre-
ated for the electronic exchange of clinical health in-
formation. Perhaps the most fine–grained source is
the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), an on-
tology created for biomedical and clinical research.

terminology that is used for indexing medical jour-
nal articles in PubMed.
These many different resources are semi-
automatically combined into the Metathesaurus,
which provides a unified view of nearly 3,000,000
different concepts. This is very important since the
same concept can exist in multiple different sources.
For example, the concept Autonomic nerve exists in
both SNOMED CT and FMA. The Metathesaurus
assigns synonymous concepts from multiple sources
a single Concept Unique Identifier (CUI). Thus
both Autonomic nerve concepts in SNOMED CT
and FMA are assigned the same CUI (C0206250).
These shared CUIs essentially merge multiple
sources into a single resource in the Metathesaurus.
Some sources in the Metathesaurus contain addi-
tional information about the concept such as syn-
onyms, definitions,6 and related concepts. Paren-
t/child (PAR/CHD) and broader/narrower (RB/RN)
are the main types of hierarchical relations between
concepts in the Metathesaurus. Parent/child rela-
tions are already defined in the sources before they
are integrated into the UMLS, whereas broader/-
narrower relations are added by the UMLS edi-
tors. For example, Splanchnic nerve has an is-a
relation with Autonomic nerve in FMA. This re-
lation is carried forward in the Metathesaurus by
creating a parent/child relation between the CUIs
C0037991 [Splanchnic nerve] and C0206250 [Au-
tonomic nerve].

The UMLS::Similarity Web interface7 allows a user
to enter two terms or UMLS CUIs as input in term
boxes. The user can choose to calculate similarity or
relatedness by clicking on the Calculate Similarity
or Calculate Relatedness button. The user can also
choose which UMLS sources and relations should
be used in the calculation. For example, if the terms
finger and arm are entered and the Compute Simi-

The Results show the terms and their assigned
CUIs. If a term has multiple possible CUIs associ-
ated with it, UMLS::Similarity returns the CUI pair
that obtained the highest similarity score. In this
case, finger was assigned CUI C0016129 and arm
assigned CUI C0449516 and the resulting similarity
score for the path measure using the MeSH hierar-
chy was 0.25.
Additionally, the paths between the concepts and
their definitions are shown. The View Definitions

between finger (C0016129) and arm (C0446516) is

shown for arm (C0446516) is The superior part
of the upper extremity between the shoulder and
the elbow.
SAB :: include and REL :: include are config-
uration parameters that define the sources and rela-
tions used to find the paths between the two CUIs
when measuring similarity. In the example above,
similarity was calculated using PAR/CHD relations
in the MeSH hierarchy.
All similarity measures default to the use of
MeSH as the source (SAB) with PAR/CHD rela-
tions. While these are reasonable defaults, for many
use cases these should be changed. Table 2 shows
the similarity scores returned for each measure us-
ing different sources. It also shows the number of
CUIs connected via PAR/CHD relations per source.

A more general example might be elbow and arm, while they are not similar, an elbow is a part-of an arm and is therefore very closely related. Measures of relatedness quantify these types of relationships by using information beyond that which is found in an is-a hierarchy, which the UMLS contains in abundance. 2 Related Work Measures of semantic similarity and relatedness have been used in a number of different biomedical and clinical applications. Early work relied on the Gene Ontology (GO)3, which is a hierarchy of terms used to describe genomic information. For example, (Lord et al., 2003) measured the similarity of gene sequence data and used this in an application for conducting semantic searches of textual resources. (Guo et al., 2006) used semantic similarity measures to identify direct and indirect protein interactions within human regulatory pathways. (N´ev´eol et al., 2006) used semantic similarity measures based on MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)4 to evaluate automatic indexing of biomedical articles by measuring the similarity between their recommended terms and the gold standard index terms.

UMLS::Similarity was first released in 2009, and since that time has been used in various different applications. (Sahay and Ram, 2010) used it in a 3http://www.geneontology.org/ 4http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2013 Demonstration Session, pages 28–31, Atlanta, Georgia, 10-12 June 2013. c�2013 Association for Computational Linguistics health information search and recommendation system. (Zhang et al., 2011) used the measures to identify redundancy within clinical records, while (Mathur and Dinakarpandian, 2011) used them to help identify similar diseases. UMLS::Similarity has also enabled the development and evaluation of new measures by allowing them to be compared to existing methods, e.g., (Pivovarov and Elhadad, 2012). Finally, UMLS::Similarity can serve as a building block in other NLP systems, for example UMLS::SenseRelate (McInnes et al., 2011) is a word sense disambiguation system for medical text based on semantic similarity and relatedness. 3 UMLS::Similarity UMLS::Similarity is a desc</context>
