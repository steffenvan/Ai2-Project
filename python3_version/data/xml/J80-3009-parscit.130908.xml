<bodyText confidence="0.934659785714286">
The Albert Thomas Convention Center in Houston,
Texas will be the site of the second annual AFIPS
Office Automation Conference (OAC) March 23-25,
1981. &amp;quot;Investing in Productivity&amp;quot; is this year&apos;s con-
ference theme, and over 200 speakers have been
scheduled in more than 60 learning sessions. The
focus of these sessions will be directed at the way in
which automation technologies can be harnessed and
integrated to increase productivity and effectiveness of
office workers. Sessions will include such topics as
Feasibility Studies, Organizational Impact, Systems
Architecture, Electronic Mail, Teleconferencing, and
State-of-the-Art in Word Processing.

The 1981 National Computer Conference, spon-
sored by AFIPS, will be held at McCormick Place in
Chicago, May 4-7, 1981. In addition to the technical
program consisting of papers, panels, surveys and tuto-
rials, there will be a series of one-day professional
development seminars and the largest exhibit of com-
puter products and services in the world.
The use of robots and artificial intelligence will be
