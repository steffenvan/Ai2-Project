<bodyText confidence="0.995178214285714">
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) ap-
proaches have reported good accuracies in
recent years. However, these approaches can
be classified as weak AI systems. According
to the classical definition, a strong AI based
WSD system should perform the task of sense
disambiguation in the same manner and with
similar accuracy as human beings. In order
to accomplish this, a detailed understanding
of the human techniques employed for sense
disambiguation is necessary. Instead of
building yet another WSD system that uses
contextual evidence for sense disambiguation,
as has been done before, we have taken a step
back - we have endeavored to discover the
cognitive faculties that lie at the very core of
the human sense disambiguation technique.
In this paper, we present a hypothesis regard-
ing the cognitive sub-processes involved in the
task of WSD. We support our hypothesis using
the experiments conducted through the means
of an eye-tracking device. We also strive to
find the levels of difficulties in annotating vari-
ous classes of words, with senses. We believe,
once such an in-depth analysis is performed,
numerous insights can be gained to develop a
robust WSD system that conforms to the prin-
ciple of strong AI.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9988183">
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is formally
defined as the task of computationally identifying
senses of a word in a context. The phrase ‘in a
context’ is not defined explicitly in the literature.
NLP researchers define it according to their conve-
nience. In our current work, we strive to unravel
the appropriate meaning of contextual evidence
used for the human annotation process. Chatterjee
et al. (2012) showed that the contextual evidence
is the predominant parameter for the human sense
annotation process. They also state that WSD is
successful as a weak AI system, and further analysis
into human cognitive activities lying at the heart of
sense annotation can aid in development of a WSD
system built upon the principles of strong AI.
Knowledge based approaches, which can be con-
sidered to be closest form of WSD conforming to
the principles of strong AI, typically achieve low
accuracy. Recent developments in domain-specific
knowledge based approaches have reported higher
accuracies. A domain-specific approach due to
Agirre et al. (2009) beats supervised WSD done
in generic domains. Ponzetto and Navigli (2010)
present a knowledge based approach which rivals
the supervised approaches by using the semantic
relations automatically extracted from Wikipedia.
They reported approximately 7% gain over the
closet supervised approach.
In this paper, we delve deep into the cognitive roles
associated with sense disambiguation through the
means of an eye-tracking device capturing the gaze
patterns of lexicographers, during the annotation
process. In-depth discussions with trained lexicog-
raphers indicate that there are multiple cognitive
sub-processes driving the sense disambiguation
task. The eye movement paths available from the
screen recordings done during sense annotation
conform to this theory.
Khapra et al. (2011) points out that the accuracy
of various WSD algorithms is poor on certain

Part-of-speech (POS) categories, particularly, verbs.
It is also a general observation for lexicographers
involved in sense annotation that there are different
levels of difficulties associated with various classes
of words. This fact is also reflected in our analysis
on sense annotation. The data available after the
eye-tracking experiments gave us the fixation times
and saccades pertaining to different classes of
words. From the analysis of this data we draw
conclusive remarks regarding the reasons behind
this phenomenon. In our case, we classified words
based on their POS categories.
In this paper, we establish that contextual evidence is
the prime parameter for the human annotation. Fur-
ther, we probe into the implication of context used
as a clue for sense disambiguation, and the manner
of its usage. In this work, we address the following
questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99874925">
• What are the cognitive sub-processes associ-
ated with the human sense annotation task?
• Which classes of words are more difficult to dis-
ambiguate and why?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999839">
By providing relevant answers to these questions we
intend to present a comprehensive understanding of
sense annotation as a complex cognitive process and
the factors involved in it. The remainder of this pa-
per is organized as follows. Section 2 contains re-
lated work. In section 3 we present the experimental
setup. Section 4 displays the results. We summarize
our findings in section 5. Finally, we conclude the
paper in section 6 presenting the future work.

As mentioned earlier, we used the eye-tracking
device to ascertain the fact that contextual evidence
is the prime parameter for human sense annotation
as quoted by Chatterjee et al. (2012) who used dif-
ferent annotation scenarios to compare human and
machine annotation processes. An eye movement
experiment was conducted by Vainio et al. (2009)
to examine effects of local lexical predictability
on fixation durations and fixation locations during
sentence reading. Their study indicates that local
lexical predictability influences in decisions but not
where the initial fixation lands in a word. In another
work based on word grouping hypothesis and eye
movements during reading by Drieghe et al. (2008),
the distribution of landing positions and durations of
first fixations in a region containing a noun preceded
by either an article or a high-frequency three-letter
word were compared.
Recently, some work is done on the study of sense
annotation. A study of sense annotations done on 10
polysemous words was conducted by Passonneau
et al. (2010). They opined that the word meanings,
contexts of use, and individual differences among
annotators gives rise to inter-annotation variations.
De Melo et al. (2012) present a study with a
focus on MASC (Manually-Annotated SubCorpus)
project, involving annotations done using WordNet
sense identifiers as well as FrameNet lexical units.
In our current work we use eye-tracking as a tool
to make findings regarding the cognitive processes
connected to the human sense disambiguation
procedure, and to gain a better understanding
of “contextual evidence” which is of paramount
importance for human annotation. Unfortunately,
our work seems to be a first of its kind, and to the
best of our knowledge we do not know of any such
work done before in the literature.

We used a generic domain (viz., News) corpus in
Hindi language for experimental purposes. To iden-
tify the levels of difficulties associated with human
annotation, across various POS categories, we con-
ducted experiments on around 2000 words (includ-
ing function words and stop words). The analysis
was done only for open class words. The statistics
pertaining to the our experiment are illustrated in ta-
ble 1. For statistical significance of our experiments,
we collected the data with the help of 3 skilled lexi-
cographers and 3 unskilled lexicographers.

A word may have a number of senses, and the task
of identifying and marking which particular sense
has been used in the given context, is known as
sense marking.
The Sense Marker tool1 is a Graphical User Inter-

itates the task of manual sense marking. This tool
displays the senses of the word as available in the
Marathi, Hindi and Princeton (English) WordNets
and allows the user to select the correct sense of the
word from the candidate senses.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.917094444444444">
The data obtained from the eye-tracking device and
corresponding analysis of the fixation times, sac-
cades and scan paths of the lexicographers’ eyes re-
veal that sense annotation is a complex cognitive
process. From the videos of the scan paths obtained
from the eye-tracking device and from detailed dis-
cussion with lexicographers it can be inferred that
this cognitive process can be broken down into 3
stages:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9402478125">
1. When a lexicographer sees a word, he/she
makes a hypothesis about the domain and con-
sequently about the correct sense of the word,
mentally. In cases of highly polysemous words,
the hypothesis may narrow down to multiple
senses. We denote the time required for this
phase as Thypo.
2. Next the lexicographer searches for clues to
support this hypothesis and in some cases to
eliminate false hypotheses, when the word is
polysemous. These clues are available in the
form of neighboring words around the target
word. We denote the time required for this ac-
tivity as Tclue.
3. The clue words aid the lexicographer to decide
which one of the initial hypotheses was true.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970943066666667">
To narrow down the candidate synsets, the lex-
icographers use synonyms of the words in a
synset to check if the sentence retains its mean-
ing.
From the scan paths and fixation times obtained
from the eye-tracking experiment, it is evident that
stages 1, 2 and 3 are chronological stages in the hu-
man cognitive process associated with sense disam-
biguation. In cases of highly polysemous words and
instances where senses are fine-grained, stages 2 and
3 get interleaved. It is also clear that each stage takes
up separate proportions of the sense disambiguation
time for humans. Hence time taken to disambiguate
a word using the Sense Marker Tool (as explained in
Section 3.1) can be factored as follows:

and their hypothesis thus formed is pruned.
Hence during selection of the winner sense,
they do not browse through other POS cate-
gories, which unskilled lexicographers do.
The results shown in figure 2 reveal that verbs take
the maximum disambiguation time. In fact the
average time taken by verbs is around 75% more
than the time taken by other POS categories. This
supports the fact that verbs are the most difficult to
disambiguate.
The analysis of the scan paths and fixation times
available from the eye-tracking experiments in case
of verbs show that the Tgloss covers around 66%
of Ttoto,l, as shown in table 2. This means that the
lexicographer takes more time in selecting a winner
sense from the list of wordnet senses. This happens
chiefly because of following reasons:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987966">
1. Higher degree of polysemy of verbs compared
to other POS categories (as shown in tables 1
and 2).
2. In several cases the senses are fine-grained.
3. Sometimes the hypothesis of the lexicogra-

<bodyText confidence="0.959810818181818">
phers may not match any of the wordnet senses.
The lexicographer then selects the wordnet
sense closest to their hypothesis.
Adverbs and adjectives show higher degree of pol-
ysemy than nouns (as shown in table 1), but take
similar disambiguation time as nouns (as shown in
figure 2). In case of adverbs and adjectives, the lex-
icographer is helped by their position around a verb
or noun respectively. So, Tclue only involves search-
ing for the nearby verbs or nouns, as the case may
be, hence reducing total disambiguation time Ttoto,l.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

<bodyText confidence="0.999466">
In this paper we examined the cognitive process that
enables the human sense disambiguation task. We
have also laid down our findings regarding the vary-
ing levels of difficulty in sense annotation across
different POS categories. These experiments are
just a stepping stone for going deeper into finding
the meaning and manner of usage of contextual
evidence which is fundamental to the human sense
annotation process.
In the future we aim to perform an in-depth analy-
sis of clue words that aid humans in sense disam-
biguation. The distance of clue words from the tar-
get word and their and pattern of occurrence could
give us significant insights into building a ‘Discrim-
ination Net’.

(2012) who used different annotation scenarios to compare human and machine annotation processes. An eye movement experiment was conducted by Vainio et al. (2009) to examine effects of local lexical predictability on fixation durations and fixation locations during sentence reading. Their study indicates that local lexical predictability influences in decisions but not where the initial fixation lands in a word. In another work based on word grouping hypothesis and eye movements during reading by Drieghe et al. (2008), the distribution of landing positions and durations of first fixations in a region containing a noun preceded by either an article or a high-frequency three-letter word were compared. Recently, some work is done on the study of sense annotation. A study of sense annotations done on 10 polysemous words was conducted by Passonneau et al. (2010). They opined that the word meanings, contexts of use, and individual differences among annotators gives rise to inter-annotation variations. De Melo et al.

In this paper, we delve deep into the cognitive roles associated with sense disambiguation through the means of an eye-tracking device capturing the gaze patterns of lexicographers, during the annotation process. In-depth discussions with trained lexicographers indicate that there are multiple cognitive sub-processes driving the sense disambiguation task. The eye movement paths available from the screen recordings done during sense annotation conform to this theory. Khapra et al.

It is also a general observation for lexicographers involved in sense annotation that there are different levels of difficulties associated with various classes of words. This fact is also reflected in our analysis on sense annotation. The data available after the eye-tracking experiments gave us the fixation times and saccades pertaini</context>

They also state that WSD is successful as a weak AI system, and further analysis into human cognitive activities lying at the heart of sense annotation can aid in development of a WSD system built upon the principles of strong AI. Knowledge based approaches, which can be considered to be closest form of WSD conforming to the principles of strong AI, typically achieve low accuracy. Recent developments in domain-specific knowledge based approaches have reported higher accuracies. A domain-specific approach due to Agirre et al. (2009) beats supervised WSD done in generic domains. Ponzetto and Navigli (2010) present a knowledge based approach which rivals the supervised approaches by using the semantic relations automatically extracted from Wikipedia. They reported approximately 7% gain over the closet supervised approach.
