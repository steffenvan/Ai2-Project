<bodyText confidence="0.996582034482759">
Pattern-Based Machine Translation
is one of the machine translation
methods which performs syntactic
analysis and structure transfer at
the same time using bilingual pat-
terns. PBMT is used to expand the
length of patterns up to sentence-
length in order to reduce ambigu-
ities in translation, but it brought
out the problem of rapidly increased
patterns. We propose a model which
shortens the length of patterns to
phrase-length and reduces ambigu-
ities in translation by using two-
level translation pattern selection
method. In the first level, the proper
translation patterns are selected by
using a hybrid method of exact ex-
ample matching and semantic con-
straint by thesaurus. In the sec-
ond level, the most natural transla-
tion pattern for the verb phrase is
selected among the selected trans-
lation pattern categories by using
statistic information of the target
language. By using this proposed
model, we could shorten the length
of patterns without raising the am-
biguities in translation.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838139534884">
A Transfer-Based Machine Translation
method generally has four steps (Kim, 1994);
morphological analysis of source language,
syntactic analysis of source language, struc-
ture transfer to the target language, and
sentence generation of the target language.
In structure transfer step, transfer patterns
used to be greatly lexicalized in order to raise
the accuracy of translation. Pattern-Based
Machine Translation (PBMT) performs both
syntactic analysis and structure transfer
simultaneously using this lexicalized patterns
(Takeda, 1996). PBMT can shorten the
translation time and raise the accuracy of
syntactic analysis by using the lexicalized
patterns.
At first, since all patterns were short
phrase-length patterns, many syntactic am-
biguities occurred in pattern matching. As
a result, patterns became longer to sentence-
length to reduce ambiguities. But, sentence-
length patterns cause pattern sparseness
problem, because the same number of
sentence-length patterns can cover less sen-
tences than the same number of phrase-length
patterns.
To overcome this problem,
Watanabe and Takeda (1998) adopted
example-based approach. However, example-
based approach has some problems. One of
the problems is that two different verbs of
target language take two semantically similar
nouns as objects respectively although a verb
of source language takes the nouns as its
objects. For example, a Korean verb ta-da&apos;
with objects &apos; bus(bus)&apos; and &apos; ma/(horse)&apos; is
translated into English verbs &apos;take&apos; and &apos;ride&apos;
respectively.
Many researches were done to solve them.
They used syntactic collocation (Kim et al.,
1996; Lee et al., 1999), semantic constraint
by thesaurus (Moon et al., 1998), semantic
features (Palmer et al., 1999) and statistical

ssu-da&apos; with the possible translation patterns
{ &apos;write NP&apos;, &apos;compose NP&apos;}). At the same
time, si&apos; is translated into &apos;poem&apos; among all
English words for the Korean word &apos; si&apos; , be-
cause only &apos;poem&apos; has the meaning of [pro-
duction(language)].
Last two translation pattern categories of
`NP-k/u/ ssu-da&apos; are constrained by exact ex-
ample matching method. For example, if
and only if the headword of a noun phrase
NP1 is &apos; chun-/yak(strategy)&apos;, NP1+ /u/ ssu-
da&apos; takes { &apos;adopt a stratagem&apos;} as its transla-
tion pattern category. Because the exact ex-
ample matching method is too rigid, it&apos;s bet-
ter to adopt example-based approach (Watan-
abe and Takeda, 1998). But, in this paper,
we only implemented exact example match-
ing method.
The proposed hybrid method of exact ex-
ample matching and semantic constraint by
thesaurus can reduce the number of possible
translation patterns and also the ambiguities
of pattern matching.
Exl) na-nun si-mi chom muk-ko nan da-
um-e ssu-go sip-da. (I want to write a poem
after eating something.)
For example, both Korean verbs &apos;rank-
da(eat)&apos; and ssu-da(write)&apos; can take si-/u/&apos;
as objects in example Exl. muk-da&apos; takes
only nouns with meaning [something to eat]
as objects, but ssu-da&apos; can take nouns with
meaning [production] as an object. As a re-
sult, si-/u/&apos; is regared as an object of &apos;ssu-da&apos;,
because si&apos; does not have the meaning [some-
thing to eat] but has the meaning [produc-
tion(language)], a hyponymy of [production].

2.2 Pattern Transfer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999429790697675">
After the selection of possible translation pat-
tern categories in pattern matching, the most
natural translation pattern among those pat-
terns is selected in pattern transfer. To ac-
quire the most natural English sentence, we
use English syntactic collocational informa-
tion, especially for subject-verb relation and
verb-object relation. We regard the English
pattern of the most frequent syntactically re-
lated pair as the most natural translation pat-
tern.
As explained above, &apos;write NP&apos;, &apos;compose
NP&apos; are selected as the translation patterns
for NP+ /u/ ssuda&apos;, and &apos;poem&apos; is selected as
the translated word for si&apos; in pattern match-
ing. Therefore, &apos;write poem&apos; and &apos;compose
poem&apos; are the possible translation for si-lul
ssu-da&apos;. English verb &apos;write, compose&apos; and
English noun &apos;poem&apos; appear as verb-object re-
lation in the corpus four times and zero times
respectively. Therefore, &apos;write poem&apos; is se-
lected as the most natural translation for si-
mul ssu-da&apos;.
Pattern transfer is needed especially when
a verb of source language can translated into
several words of target language according to
objects, although the verb takes semantically
similar nouns as objects. For example, NP in
`NP+ /u/ ta-go ka-da&apos; must have the meaning
[something to ride], and its translation pat-
terns can be &apos;ride NP&apos; or &apos;go by NP&apos;. There are
many Korean nouns with the meaning [some-
thing to ride] like &apos;horse&apos;, &apos;car&apos;, &apos;bus&apos;, &apos;train&apos;
and so on. When the headword of NP is
&apos;horse&apos; or &apos;car&apos;, NP+ /u/ ta-go ka-da&apos; is usually
translated into &apos;ride NP&apos;, but when the head-
word of NP is &apos;bus&apos; or &apos;train&apos;, NP+ /u/ ta-go
ka-da&apos; is usually translated as &apos;go by NP&apos;. But
the Korean thesaurus, which we used, does
not bring out the differences. This problem
shows that Korean and English have very dif-
ferent semantic hierarchies of thesaurus con-
struction (Palmer et al., 1999).

2.3 Pattern Scoring
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996">
We used Generalized LR parsing (GLR) al-
gorithm (Tomita, 1991) for pattern match-
ing. To prune out nodes made by GLR al-
gorithm during pattern matching, we score
each node and remove nodes which have lower
score than those of the top ten nodes with
the same range and the same syntactic cat-
egory. To score each node, several methods
can be used; the frequency of each pattern
in the corpus (Sorniertlamvanich, 1998) and
the Korean syntactic collocational informa-
tion (Yoon, 1998). Since we use very lexi-
calized patterns, the frequency of each pat-
tern in the corpus is not available. Also we
didn&apos;t describe syntactic information of the

sentences. These also include much gen-

cational information (about 54,000 different

that as the size of corpus is bigger, the num-

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997905">
We proposed two-level translation pattern
selection model to reduce the length of pat-
tern and reduce the ambiguities occurred due
to short patterns. In the first step, the am-
biguities in the pattern matching is reduced
and several translation pattern categories
are selected by the hybrid method of exact
example matching and semantic constraint
by thesaurus. In the second step, the most
natural translation pattern is selected by the
English syntactic collocational information.
In the future, it is needed to use the syn-
tactic collocational information of Korean to
reduce ambiguities in pattern matching step.
Also it is needed to expand the syntactic
collocational information of English, e.g.
adjective-noun relation and verb-adverb
relation. And research on restoring the
necessary information in English sentence
has to be done.

One of the problems is that two different verbs of target language take two semantically similar nouns as objects respectively although a verb of source language takes the nouns as its objects. For example, a Korean verb ta-da&apos; with objects &apos; bus(bus)&apos; and &apos; ma/(horse)&apos; is translated into English verbs &apos;take&apos; and &apos;ride&apos; respectively. Many researches were done to solve them. They used syntactic collocation (Kim et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1999), semantic constraint by thesaurus (Moon et al., 1998), semantic features (Palmer et al., 1999) and statistical ‘’ ‘’ ‘ ’ ‘ ’ ssu-da&apos; with the possible translation patterns { &apos;write NP&apos;, &apos;compose NP&apos;}). At the same time, si&apos; is translated into &apos;poem&apos; among all English words for the Korean word &apos; si&apos; , because only &apos;poem&apos; has the meaning of [production(language)]. Last two translation pattern categories of `NP-k/u/ ssu-da&apos; are constrained by exact example matching method. For example, if and only if the headword of a noun phrase NP1 is &apos; chun-/yak(strategy)&apos;, NP1+ /u/ ssuda&apos; takes { &apos;adopt a stratagem&apos;} as its translation pattern category.

In structure transfer step, transfer patterns used to be greatly lexicalized in order to raise the accuracy of translation. Pattern-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) performs both syntactic analysis and structure transfer simultaneously using this lexicalized patterns (Takeda, 1996). PBMT can shorten the translation time and raise the accuracy of syntactic analysis by using the lexicalized patterns. At first, since all patterns were short phrase-length patterns, many syntactic ambiguities occurred in pattern matching. As a result, patterns became longer to sentencelength to reduce ambiguities. But, sentencelength patterns cause pattern sparseness problem, because the same number of sentence-length patterns can cover less sentences than the same number of phrase-length patterns. To overcome this problem, Watanabe and Takeda (1998) adopted example-based approach. However, </context>
