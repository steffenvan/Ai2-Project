Having matured to the point of utility for certain circumscribed applications, natu-
ral language processing (NLP) technology has a growing need for the formulation
of evaluation methodologies. Evaluating Natural Language Processing Systems: An Anal-
ysis and Review provides a historical perspective and outline of efforts that have been
made to provide meaningful and useful evaluations of NLP systems, describes the
deficiencies of those efforts, and offers an evaluation approach intended to address
those deficiencies.
Evaluating Natural Language Processing Systems is divided into three chapters. While
Chapter 1 purports to introduce evaluation concepts and terminology, the esoteric
presentation style detracts from its value for technology neophytes. The chapter does,
however, provide a great deal of information and in the course of doing so, presents
relevant, interesting issues such as the special problems associated with evaluating so-
called generic systems, and the value of qualitative versus (or, in conjunction with)
quantitative evaluation approaches.
Chapter 2 is a comprehensive and in-depth review of significant NLP evaluation
research activities and resources, ranging across multiple modalities (e.g., speech), task
domains (e.g., message processing), participatory activities (e.g., workshops, tutori-
als), evaluation methodologies and experiment techniques (e.g., Wizard-of-Oz experi-
ments), resources (e.g., corpora, test suites, toolkits), and resource associations (e.g., the
Linguistic Data Consortium). It is made up of three sections. Subdivisions within the
first section focus on evaluation activities in each of the task areas of machine transla-
tion, message processing, database inquiry, speech understanding, summarizing and
message categorization. The task area of text retrieval evaluation is also reported here,
with the caveat that &amp;quot;though text retrieval is not defined here as an NLP task,&amp;quot; recent
evaluation activities &amp;quot;recognising the effects of environment and task or function com-
plexity&amp;quot; are relevant to NLP system evaluation. Section 1 concludes with a brief, but
excellent, investigation of whether &amp;quot;lessons&amp;quot; learned from task-specific evaluations
provide any insight toward the development of general NLP evaluation tools, and
lists seven basic, clear and concise, lessons relating to the set-up requirements for any
(general or task-specific) NLP evaluation. These lessons are recommendations about
evaluation parameters that must be clarified before an evaluation takes place.
Section 2 of Chapter 2 presents a survey of NLP evaluation activities and materi-

als that do not focus on specific NLP tasks. Informative synopses of three evaluation
workshops, two parsing evaluation workshops, and an evaluation tutorial are pro-
vided. An assessment of the general impact of DARPA-sponsored activities acknowl-
edges DARPA&apos;s crucial role in NLP evaluation and presents a penetrating critique
of those activities. Two evaluation methodologies, the Wizard-of-Oz method and the
Neal-Montgomery System Evaluation Methodology, are reviewed. I was peripherally
involved in the development of the latter of these and was astonished to read that it
&amp;quot;was intended by its authors to be the standard evaluation tool for any NLP system.&amp;quot;
Unfortunately, I believe that I am the source of that misinformation, having misin-
terpreted, and responded to, a query at the DARPA Speech and Natural Language
Workshop of February 1992 about the methodology as &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; standard. I hope my
misstatement has not deterred researchers from investigating the value of that excep-
tional piece of work. As I stated in the preface of Neal et al. (1992), &amp;quot;The evaluation
methodology is not presented here as a product to be accepted, in toto, by the NLP
community as the standard for system evaluation, but rather as a basis for discussion,
critique, and possible refinement towards standards development.&amp;quot;
Sparck Jones and Galliers conclude Chapter 2 with a summary of four basic re-
quirements for NLP evaluations that they have derived from their observation of
existing approaches and methodologies:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999774">
1. Evaluations must be designed to address issues relevant to the specific
task domain of the NLP system; therefore, NLP systems operating in
different task domains require different evaluation criteria.
2. Evaluations must focus more attention on the &amp;quot;environmental&amp;quot; factors
associated with NLP systems in actual use—for example, end-user
characteristics.
3. Evaluations must identify all system elements that can figure as

performance factors. Sparck Jones and Galliers recommend use of a
process of &amp;quot;factor decomposition&amp;quot; to ensure that all relevant aspects of a
system and its environment are considered in an evaluation.
4. Evaluation criteria for generic NLP systems are not, and probably cannot
be, adequately defined. It is the authors&apos; opinion that generic systems
must be instantiated within a task to allow meaningful evaluation.
In Chapter 3, from conclusions presented in Chapter 2, the authors propose that
evaluations be designed and conducted on the basis of an in-depth examination (by
&amp;quot;decomposition&amp;quot;) of all NLP system and environmental factors that may affect perfor-
mance. The in-depth examination is performed comprehensively and systematically, in
a top-down fashion, before the evaluation per se proceeds. In the first phase, answers
to a series of general questions about the purpose and mode of evaluation define the
evaluation remit. Information in the remit is then used to develop the evaluation de-
sign, the precise definition of the evaluation parameter settings. Together, the remit
and design represent the fine detail of all aspects of the evaluation. Evaluations with
minor variations on the entries in the remit or design represent individual runs of the
evaluation, which can then be compared to each other by presenting them in a grid for-
mat. This evaluation methodology is proposed to address the four basic requirements
of NLP evaluations (above, from the book&apos;s Chapter 2).
The NLP system evaluation methodology described by Sparck Jones and Galliers
makes the circumstances of evaluations clear, comparable, and repeatable. Properly

applied, it could ensure common, consistent ground conditions for NLP system eval-
uation comparisons, making it a very valuable resource. The evaluation methodology
does not, however, appear to strike at the heart of the evaluation problem of defining
specific criteria by which to describe and compare system capabilities, evading the
issue in fact by proposing that general criteria cannot be defined due to the necessity
of case-by-case specification of evaluation criteria.
I disagree with the authors&apos; premise that generic NLP systems cannot be evaluated
without being instantiated within a specific task domain. As a matter of fact, it seems
that the proposed evaluation methodology goes a great distance towards providing a
means to relay valuable information about the boundary capabilities of an uninstan-
tiated generic system. Further, in doing so, the methodology may characterize classes
of task domains to which a generic system could appropriately be applied and the
data that is required for its instantiation.
Finally, on a book format matter, there is a glossary at the front of the book, but the
definitions it provides are neither complete nor sufficiently descriptive of its terms to
be of use. For example, complexity, operation, parameter, and transportability are all listed
with the same vague glossary definition, &amp;quot;of system.&amp;quot; Similarly, broad scope, narrow
scope, and working are listed with the obscure definition, &amp;quot;of setup.&amp;quot; A separate table
of abbreviations would also have been worthwhile.
