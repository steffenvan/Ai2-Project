Substantial research effort has been in-
vested in recent decades into the com-
putational study and automatic process-
ing of multi-party conversation. While
most aspects of conversational speech
have benefited from a wide availabil-
ity of analytic, computationally tractable
techniques, only qualitative assessments
are available for characterizing multi-party
turn-taking. The current paper attempts to
address this deficiency by first proposing
a framework for computing turn-taking
model perplexity, and then by evaluat-
ing several multi-participant modeling ap-
proaches. Experiments show that direct
multi-participant models do not general-
ize to held out data, and likely never will,
for practical reasons. In contrast, the
Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model rep-
resents a suitable candidate for future
work in this area, and is shown to success-
fully predict the distribution of speech in
time and across participants in previously
unseen conversations.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999974327272727">
Substantial research effort has been invested in
recent decades into the computational study and
automatic processing of multi-party conversation.
Whereas sociolinguists might argue that multi-
party settings provide for the most natural form
of conversation, and that dialogue and monologue
are merely degenerate cases (Jaffe and Feldstein,
1970), computational approaches have found it
most expedient to leverage past successes; these
often involved at most one speaker. Consequently,
even in multi-party settings, automatic systems
generally continue to treat participants indepen-
dently, fusing information across participants rel-
atively late in processing.
This state of affairs has resulted in the near-
exclusion from computational consideration and
from semantic analysis of a phenomenon which
occurs at the lowest level of speech exchange,
namely the relative timing of the deployment of
speech in arbitrary multi-party groups. This phe-
nomenon, the implicit taking of turns at talk
(Sacks et al., 1974), is important because unless
participants adhere to its general rules, a conver-
sation would simply not take place. It is there-
fore somewhat surprising that while most other
aspects of speech enjoy a large base of computa-
tional methodologies for their study, there are few
quantitative techniques for assessing the flow of
turn-taking in general multi-party conversation.
The current work attempts to address this prob-
lem by proposing a simple framework, which, at
least conceptually, borrows quite heavily from the
standard language modeling paradigm. First, it de-
fines the perplexity of a vector-valued Markov pro-
cess whose multi-participant states are a concate-
nation of the binary states of individual speakers.
Second, it presents some obvious evidence regard-
ing the unsuitability of models defined directly
over this space, under various assumptions of in-
dependence, for the inference of conversation-
independent norms of turn-taking. Finally, it
demonstrates that the extended-degree-of-overlap
model of (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007), which
models participants in an alternate space, achieves
by far the best likelihood estimates for previ-
ously unseen conversations. This appears to be
because the model can learn across conversa-
tions, regardless of the number of their partici-
pants. Experimental results show that it yields
relative perplexity reductions of approximately
75% when compared to the ubiquitous single-
participant model which ignores interlocutors, in-
dicating that it can learn and generalize aspects of
interaction which direct multi-participant models,
and merely single-participant models, cannot.

<bodyText confidence="0.999528">
Analysis and experiments are performed using the
ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003; Shriberg
et al., 2004). The corpus consists of 75 meetings,
held by various research groups at ICSI, which
would have occurred even if they had not been
recorded. This is important for studying naturally
occurring interaction, since any form of interven-
tion (including occurrence staging solely for the
purpose of obtaining a record) may have an un-
known but consistent impact on the emergence of
turn-taking behaviors. Each meeting was attended
by 3 to 9 participants, providing a wide variety of
possible interaction types.

3 Conceptual Framework
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.908105">
3.1 Definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985090909091">
Turn-taking is a generally observed phenomenon
in conversation (Sacks et al., 1974; Goodwin,
1981; Schegloff, 2007); one party talks while the
others listen. Its description and analysis is an
important problem, treated frequently as a sub-
domain of linguistic pragmatics (Levinson, 1983).
In spite of this, linguists tend to disagree about
what precisely constitutes a turn (Sacks et al.,
1974; Edelsky, 1981; Goodwin, 1981; Traum and
Heeman, 1997), or even a turn boundary. For ex-
ample, a “yeah” produced by a listener to indicate
attentiveness, referred to as a backchannel (Yngve,
1970), is often considered to not implement a turn
(nor to delineate an ongoing turn of an interlocu-
tor), as it bears no propositional content and does
not “take the floor” from the current speaker.
To avoid being tied to any particular sociolin-
guistic theory, the current work equates “turn”
with any contiguous interval of speech uttered by
the same participant. Such intervals are commonly
referred to as talk spurts (Norwine and Murphy,
1938). Because Norwine and Murphy’s original
definition is somewhat ambiguous and non-trivial
to operationalize, this work relies on that proposed
by (Shriberg et al., 2001), in which spurts are “de-
fined as speech regions uninterrupted by pauses
longer than 500 ms” (italics in the original). Here,
a threshold of 300 ms is used instead, as recently
proposed in NIST’s Rich Transcription Meeting
Recognition evaluations (NIST, 2002). The re-
sulting definition of talk spurt, it is important to
note, is in quite common use but frequently un-
der different names. An oft-cited example is the
inter-pausal unit of (Koiso et al., 1998)1, where
the threshold is 100 ms.
A consequence of this choice is that any model
of turn-taking behavior inferred will effectively be
a model of the distribution of speech, in time and
across participants. If the parameters of such a
model are maximum likelihood (ML) estimates,
then that model will best account for what is most
likely, or most “normal”; it will constitute a norm.
Finally, an important aspect of this work is that
it analyzes turn-taking behavior as independent of
the words spoken (and of the ways in which those
words are spoken). As a result, strictly speaking,
what is modeled is not the distribution of speech in
time and across participants but of binary speech
activity in time and across participants. Despite
this seemingly dramatic simplification, it will be
seen that important aspects of turn-taking are suffi-
ciently rare to be problematic for modeling. Mod-
eling them jointly alongside lexical information,
in multi-party scenarios, is likely to remain in-
tractable for the foreseeable future.

3.2 The Vocal Interaction Record Q

<bodyText confidence="0.997715272727273">
The notation used here, as in (Laskowski and
Schultz, 2007), is a trivial extension of that pro-
posed in (Rabiner, 1989) to vector-valued Markov
processes.
At any instant t, each of K participants to a con-
versation is in a state drawn from IF ≡ {S0, S1} ≡
{❑, ■}, where S1 ≡ ■ indicates speech (or, more
precisely, “intra-talk-spurt instants”) and S0 ≡
❑ indicates non-speech (or “inter-talk-spurt in-
stants”). The joint state of all participants at time
t is described using the K-length column vector

Q is known as the (discrete) vocal interaction
(Dabbs and Ruback, 1987) record. T is the total

Given this definition of Q, a model Θ is sought
to account for it. Only time-independent models,
whose parameters do not change over the course

For simplicity, the state q0 = S0 =

fusion with conversation duration T) is first
prepended to Q. P0 = P ( q0 ) therefore repre-

which the conversation was at time t − 1 and the

not of the instants t − 1 or t. It may be expressed

ity. As can be seen in Equation 8, the negative
log-likelihood is normalized by the number K of
participants and the number T of frames in Q;
the latter renders the measure useful for making
duration-independent comparisons. The normal-
ization by K does not per se suggest that turn-
taking in conversations with different K is nec-
essarily similar; it merely provides similar bounds
on the magnitudes of these metrics.

In contrast to multi-party conversation, dialogue
has been extensively modeled in the ways de-
scribed in this paper. Beginning with (Brady,
1969), Markov modeling techniques over the joint
speech activity of two interlocutors have been
explored by both the sociolinguist and the psy-
cholinguist community (Jaffe and Feldstein, 1970;
Dabbs and Ruback, 1987). The same models have
also appeared in dialogue systems (Raux, 2008).
Most recently, they have been augmented with du-
ration models in a study of the Switchboard corpus
(Grothendieck et al., 2009).

In the general case beyond dialogue, such mod-

the exponential growth in the number of states as
K increases, and partly due to difficulties in in-

the author is familiar with is the GroupTalk model
(Dabbs and Ruback, 1987), which is unsuitable

4.2.1 Conditionally Dependent Participants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995377355555556">
In a particular conversation with K participants,
the state space of an ergodic process contains
2K states, and the number of free parameters in
a model O which treats participant behavior as
conditionally dependent (CD), henceforth OCD,
scales as 2K · (2K − 1l. It should be immediately
obvious that many of the 2K states are likely to not
occur within a conversation of duration T, leading
to misestimation of the desired probabilities.
To demonstrate this, three perplexity trajecto-
ries for a snippet of meeting Bmr024 are shown
in Figure 1, in the interval beginning 5 minutes
into the meeting and ending 20 minutes later. (The
meeting is actually just over 50 minutes long but
only a snippet is shown to better appreciate small
time-scale variation.) The depicted perplexities
are not unweighted averages over the whole meet-
ing of duration T as in Equation 8, but over a 60-
second Hamming window centered on each t.
The first trajectory, the dashed black line, is ob-
tained when the entire meeting is used to estimate
OCD, and is then scored by that same model (an
“oracle” condition). Significant perplexity varia-
tion is observed throughout the depicted snippet.
The second trajectory, the continuous black
line, is that obtained when the meeting is split into
two equal-duration halves, one consisting of all in-
stants prior to the midpoint and the other of all
instants following it. These halves are hereafter
referred to as A and B, respectively (the interval
in Figure 1 falls entirely within the A half). Two
separate models OCD Aand OCD
B are each trained
on only one of the two halves, and then applied to
those same halves. As can be seen at the scale em-
ployed, the matched A+B model, demonstrating
the effect of training data ablation, deviates from
the global oracle model only in the intervals [7,11]
seconds and [15,18] seconds; otherwise it appears
that more training data, from later in the conversa-
tion, does not affect model performance.
Finally, the third trajectory, the continuous gray
line, is obtained when the two halves A and B
of the meeting are scored using the mismatched
models OCD

A , respectively (this condi-
tion is henceforth referred to as the B+A condi-
tion). It can be seen that even when probabilities
are estimated from the same participants, in ex-
actly the same conversation, a direct conditionally
dependent model exposed to over 25 minutes of
a conversation cannot predict the turn-taking pat-
terns observed later.

<bodyText confidence="0.999962125">
A potential reason for the gross misestimation of
OCD under mismatched conditions is the size of
the state space {S}. The number of parameters in
the model can be reduced by assuming that par-
ticipants behave independently at instant t, but are
conditioned on their joint behavior at t − 1. The
likelihood of Q under the resulting conditionally
independent model OCI has the form

the latter is reproduced as a reference. The con-
tinuous black and gray lines show the smoothed
perplexity for the matched (A+B) and the mis-
matched (B+A) conditions, respectively. In the
matched condition, the CI model reproduces the
oracle trajectory with relatively high fidelity, sug-
gesting that participants’ behavior may in fact be
assumed to be conditionally independent in the
sense discussed. Furthermore, the failures of the
CI model under mismatched conditions are less se-
vere in magnitude than those of the CD model.
Panel (b) of Figure 2 demonstrates the trivial
fact that a conditionally independent model ΘCI
any,
tying the statistics of all K participants into a sin-
gle model, is useless. This is of course because it
cannot predict the next state of a generic partici-
pant for which the index k in qt−1 has been lost.

Panel (c) of Figure 2 shows that the MI model

better approximation to its performance under
matched conditions. However, its matched perfor-
mance is worse than that of CD and CI models.
When a single MI model ΘMI
any is trained instead
for all participants, as shown in panel (d), both of
these effects are exaggerated. In fact, the perfor-
mance of ΘMI
any in matched and mismatched con-
ditions is almost identical. The consistently higher
perplexity is obtained, as mentioned, by smooth-
ing over 60-second windows, and therefore un-
derestimates poor performance at specific instants
(which occur frequently).

As the analyses in Section 4 reveal, direct es-
timation can be useful under oracle conditions,
namely when all of a conversation has been ob-
served and the task is to find intervals where multi-
participant behavior deviates significantly from
its conversation-specific norm. The assumption
of conditional independence among participants
was argued to lead to negligible degradation in
the detectability of these intervals. However, the
assumption of mutual independence consistently
leads to higher surprise by the model.

limit the perplexity of what is still to come, direct
estimation exhibits relatively large failures under
both conditionally dependent and conditionally in-

to be due to the size of the state space, which
scales as 2K with the number K of participants.

insufficient, and, for practical reasons3, impossi-
ble. One would instead like to be able to use other
conversations, also exhibiting participant interac-
tion, to limit the perplexity of speech occurrence
in the conversation under study.
Unfortunately, there are two reasons why direct
estimation cannot be tractably deployed across
conversations. The first is that the direct models
considered here, with the exception of OMI
any, are
K-specific. In particular, the number and the iden-
tity of conditioning states are both functions of K,
for OCD and {OCI

k }. No techniques for computing the turn-
taking perplexity in conversations with K partici-
pants, using models trained on conversations with
K′ =� K, are currently available.
The second reason is that these models, again
with the exception of OMI
any, are R-specific, in-
dependently of K-specificity. By this it is meant
that the models are sensitive to participant index
permutation. Had a participant at index k in Q
been assigned to another index k′7�k, an alter-
nate representation of the conversation, namely
Q′ = Rkk′ · Q, would have been obtained. (Here,
Rkk′ is a matrix rotation operator obtained by ex-
changing columns k and k′ of the K x K identity
matrix I.) Since index assignment is entirely arbi-

In addition to the concerns above, a funda-
mental limitation of the analyzed direct models,
whether for conversation-specific or conversation-
independent use, is that they are theoretically cum-
bersome if not vacuous. Given a solution to the
problem of R-specificity, the parameters {aCD
ij }
may be robustly inferred, and the models may be
applied to yield useful estimates of turn-taking
perplexity. However, they cannot be said to di-
rectly validate or dispute the vast qualitative ob-
servations of sociolinguistics, and of conversation

To produce Figures 1 and 2, a small fraction of
probability mass was reserved for unseen bigram
transitions (as opposed to backing off to unigram
probabilities). Furthermore, transitions into never-
observed states were assigned uniform probabili-
ties. This policy is simplistic, and there is signifi-
cant scope for more detailed back-off and interpo-
lation. However, such techniques infer values for
under-estimated probabilities from shorter trunca-
tions of the conditioning history. As K-specificity
and R-specificity suggest, what appears to be
needed here are back-off and interpolation across
states. For example, in a conversation of K = 5
participants, estimates of the likelihood of the state
qt = [EINE■❑]∗, which might have been unob-
served in any training material, can be assumed

The limitations of direct models appear to be ad-

Extended-Degree-of-Overlap (EDO) model, was
used to provide prior probabilities P (Q  |O ) of
the speech states of multiple meeting participants
simultaneously, for use in speech activity detec-

taking perplexities of their data sets.
Several of the equations in (Laskowski and
Schultz, 2007) are reproduced here for compar-
ison. The EDO model yields time-independent
transition probabilities which assume conditional

the role of αij in Equation 16 is deferred to the
end of this section.
The EDO model mitigates R-specificity be-
cause it models each bigram (qt−1, qt) = (Si, Sj)
as the modified bigram (ni, [oij, nj]), involving
three scalars each of which is a sum — a com-
mutative (and therefore rotation-invariant) opera-
tion. Because it sums across only those partici-
pants which are in the ■ state, completely ignor-
ing their El-state interlocutors, it can also mitigate
K-specificity if one additionally redefines
ni = min (kSik, Kmax )
nj = min (kSjk, Kmax )
oij = min (kSi · Sjk, ni, nj) ,
as in (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007). Kmax
represents the maximum model-licensed degree
of overlap, or the maximum number of par-
ticipants allowed to be simultaneously speak-
ing. The EDO model therefore represents a
viable conversation-independent, K-independent,
and R-independent model of turn-taking for the
purposes in the current work4. The factor αij
4There exists some empirical evidence to suggest that
conversations of K participants should not be used to train
models for predicting turn-taking behavior in conversations
of K′ participants, for K′ =� K, because turn-taking is in-
herently K-dependent. For example, (Fay et al., 2000) found
that qualitative differences in turn-taking patterns between
in Equation 16 provides a deterministic map-
ping from the conversation-independent space
(ni, [oij, nj]) to the conversation-specific space
{�ij}. The mapping is deterministic because the
model assumes that all participants are identical.
This places the EDO model at a disadvantage with
respect to the CD and CI models, as well as to
{O�I

eled differently.

7.1 Conversation-Specific Modeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992181864864865">
First to be explored is the prediction of yet-
unobserved behavior in conversation-specific set-
tings. For each meeting, models are trained on
portions of that meeting only, and then used to
score other portions of the same meeting. This
is repeated over all meetings, and comprises the
mismatched condition of Section 4; for contrast,
the matched condition is also evaluated.
Each meeting is divided into two halves, in two
different ways. The first way is the A/B split of
Section 4, representing the first and second halves
of each meeting; as has been shown, turn-taking
patterns may vary substantially from A to B. The
second split (C/D) places every even-numbered
frame in one set and every odd-numbered frame
in the other. This yields a much easier setting, of
two halves which are on average maximally simi-
lar but still temporally disjoint.
The perplexities (of Equation 9) in these experi-
ments are shown in the second, fourth, sixth and
eighth columns of Table 1, under “all”. In the
matched A+B and C+D conditions, the condition-
ally dependent model OCD provides topline ML
performance. Perplexities decrease as model com-
plexities fall for direct models, as expected. How-
ever, in the more interesting mismatched B+A
condition, the EDO model performs the best. This
shows that its ability to generalize to unseen data
is higher than that of direct models. However, in
the easier mismatched D+C condition, it is out-
performed by the CI model due to behavior differ-
ences among participants, which the EDO model

The model perplexities as reported above may
be somewhat different if the “talk spurt” were
replaced by a more sociolinguistically motivated
definition of “turn”, but the ranking of models and
their relative performance differences are likely to
remain quite similar. On the one hand, many inter-
talk-spurt gaps might find themselves to be within-
turn, leading to more ■ entries in the record Q
than observed in the current work. This would
increase the apparent frequency and duration of
intervals of overlap. On the other hand, alterna-
tive definitions of turn may exclude some speech
activity, such as that implementing backchannels.
Since backchannels are often produced in overlap
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.973265">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986">
with the foreground speaker, their removal may
eliminate some overlap from Q. (However, as
noted in (Shriberg et al., 2001), overlap rates in
multi-party conversation remain high even after
the exclusion of backchannels.) Both inter-talk-
spurt gap inclusion and backchannel exclusion are
likely to yield systematic differences, and there-
fore to be exploitable by the investigated models
in similar ways.
The results presented may also be perturbed
by modifying the way in which a (manually
produced) talk spurt segmentation, with high-
precision boundary time-stamps, is discretized to
yield Q. Two parameters have controlled the dis-
cretization in this work: (1) the frame step T3 =
100 ms; and (2) the proportion p of T3 for which
a participant must be speaking within a frame in
order for that frame to be considered ■ rather than
❑. p = 0.5 was chosen since this posits approx-
imately as much more speech (than in the high-
precision segmentation) as it eliminates. Higher
values of p would lead to more ■, leading to more
overlap than observed in this work. Meanwhile, at
constant p, choosing a T3 value larger than 100 ms
would occasionally miss the shortest talk spurts,
but it would allow the models, which are all 1st-
order Markovian, to learn temporally more dis-
tant dependencies. The trade-offs between these
choices are currently under investigation.
From an operational, modeling perspective, it
is important to recognize that the choices of the
definition for “turn”, and of the way in which
segmentations are discretized, are essentially ar-
bitrary. The investigated modeling alternatives,
and the EDO model in particular, require only that
the multi-participant vocal interaction record Q
be binary-valued. This general applicability has
been demonstrated in past work, in which the EDO
model was trained on utterances for use in speech
activity detection (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007),
as well as in (Laskowski and Burger, 2007) where
it was trained separately on talk spurts and laugh
bouts, in the same data, to highlight the differences
between speech and laughter deployment.
Finally, it should be remembered that the EDO
model is both time-independent and participant-
independent. This makes it suitable for compar-
ison of conversational genres, in much the same
way as are general language models of words. Ac-
cordingly, as for language models, density esti-
mation in future turn-taking models may be im-
proved by considering variability across partic-
ipants and in time. Participant dependence is
likely to be related to speakers’ social character-
istics and conversational roles, while time depen-
dence may reflect opening and closing functions,
topic boundaries, and periodic turn exchange fail-
ures. In the meantime, event types such as the lat-
ter may be detectable as EDO perplexity depar-
tures, potentially recommending the model’s use
for localizing conversational “hot spots” (Wrede
and Shriberg, 2003). The EDO model, and turn-
taking models in general, may also find use in
diagnosing turn-taking naturalness in spoken di-
alogue systems.

9 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986588235294">
This paper has presented a framework for quan-
tifying the turn-taking perplexity in multi-party
conversations. To begin with, it explored the con-
sequences of modeling participants jointly by con-
catenating their binary speech/non-speech states
into a single multi-participant vector-valued state.
Analysis revealed that such models are particu-
larly poor at generalization, even to subsequent
portions of the same conversation. This is due to
the size of their state space, which is factorial in
the number of participants. Furthermore, because
such models are both specific to the number of
participants and to the order in which participant
states are concatenated together, it is generally in-
tractable to train them on material from other con-
versations. The only such model which may be
trained on other conversations is that which com-
pletely ignores interlocutor interaction.
In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap
(EDO) construction of (Laskowski and Schultz,
2007) may be trained on other conversations, re-
gardless of their number of participants, and use-
fully applied to approximate the turn-taking per-
plexity of an oracle model. This is achieved be-
cause it models entry into and egress out of spe-
cific degrees of overlap, and completely ignores
the number of participants actually present or their
modeled arrangement. In this sense, the EDO
model can be said to implement the qualitative
findings of conversation analysis. In predicting the
distribution of speech in time and across partici-
pants, it reduces the unseen data perplexity of a
model which ignores interaction by 75% relative
to an oracle model.

<abstract confidence="0.99898948">Substantial research effort has been invested in recent decades into the computational study and automatic processing of multi-party conversation. While most aspects of conversational speech have benefited from a wide availability of analytic, computationally tractable techniques, only qualitative assessments are available for characterizing multi-party turn-taking. The current paper attempts to address this deficiency by first proposing a framework for computing turn-taking model perplexity, and then by evaluating several multi-participant modeling approaches. Experiments show that direct multi-participant models do not generalize to held out data, and likely never will, for practical reasons. In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model represents a suitable candidate for future work in this area, and is shown to successfully predict the distribution of speech in time and across participants in previously unseen conversations.</abstract>

Beginning with (Brady, 1969), Markov modeling techniques over the joint speech activity of two interlocutors have been explored by both the sociolinguist and the psycholinguist community (Jaffe and Feldstein, 1970; Dabbs and Ruback, 1987).

In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap model represents a suitable candidate for future work in this area, and is shown to successfully predict the distribution of speech in time and across participants in previously unseen conversations. 1 Introduction Substantial research effort has been invested in recent decades into the computational study and automatic processing of multi-party conversation. Whereas sociolinguists might argue that multiparty settings provide for the most natural form of conversation, and that dialogue and monologue are merely degenerate cases (Jaffe and Feldstein, 1970), computational approaches have found it most expedient to leverage past successes; these often involved at most one speaker. Consequently, even in multi-party settings, automatic systems generally continue to treat participants independently, fusing information across participants relatively late in processing. This state of affairs has resulted in the nearexclusion from computational consideration and from semantic analysis of a phenomenon which occurs at the lowest level of speech exchange, namely the relative timing of the deployment of speech in arbitrary multi-party groups.

Here, a threshold of 300 ms is used instead, as recently proposed in NIST’s Rich Transcription Meeting Recognition evaluations (NIST, 2002). The resulting definition of talk spurt, it is important to note, is in quite common use but frequently under different names. An oft-cited example is the inter-pausal unit of (Koiso et al., 1998)1, where the threshold is 100 ms. A consequence of this choice is that any model of turn-taking behavior inferred will effectively be a model of the distribution of speech, in time and across participants. If the parameters of such a model are maximum likelihood (ML) estimates, then that model will best account for what is most likely, or most “normal”; it will constitute a norm.

From an operational, modeling perspective, it is important to recognize that the choices of the definition for “turn”, and of the way in which segmentations are discretized, are essentially arbitrary. The investigated modeling alternatives, and the EDO model in particular, require only that the multi-participant vocal interaction record Q be binary-valued. This general applicability has been demonstrated in past work, in which the EDO model was trained on utterances for use in speech activity detection (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007), as well as in (Laskowski and Burger, 2007) where it was trained separately on talk spurts and laugh bouts, in the same data, to highlight the differences between speech and laughter deployment. Finally, it should be remembered that the EDO model is both time-independent and participantindependent. This makes it suitable for comparison of conversational genres, in much the same way as are general language models of words.

First, it defines the perplexity of a vector-valued Markov process whose multi-participant states are a concatenation of the binary states of individual speakers. Second, it presents some obvious evidence regarding the unsuitability of models defined directly over this space, under various assumptions of independence, for the inference of conversationindependent norms of turn-taking. Finally, it demonstrates that the extended-degree-of-overlap model of (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007), which models participants in an alternate space, achieves by far the best likelihood estimates for previously unseen conversations. This appears to be because the model can learn across conversations, regardless of the number of their participants.

As a result, strictly speaking, what is modeled is not the distribution of speech in time and across participants but of binary speech activity in time and across participants. Despite this seemingly dramatic simplification, it will be seen that important aspects of turn-taking are sufficiently rare to be problematic for modeling. Modeling them jointly alongside lexical information, in multi-party scenarios, is likely to remain intractable for the foreseeable future. 3.2 The Vocal Interaction Record Q The notation used here, as in (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007), is a trivial extension of that proposed in (Rabiner, 1989) to vector-valued Markov processes. At any instant t, each of K participants to a conversation is in a state drawn from IF ≡ {S0, S1} ≡ {❑, ■}, where S1 ≡ ■ indicates speech (or, more precisely, “intra-talk-spurt instants”) and S0 ≡ ❑ indicates non-speech (or “inter-talk-spurt instants”). The joint state of all participants at time t is described using the K-length column vector qt ∈ 1pK ≡ 1p × lp × ... × lp ≡ {S0, S1, ... , S2x−1 } .

That form, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap (EDO) model, was used to provide prior probabilities P (Q |O ) of the speech states of multiple meeting participants simultaneously, for use in speech activity detection. The model was trained on utterances (rather than talk spurts) from a different corpus than that 1004 used here, and the authors did not explore the turntaking perplexities of their data sets. Several of the equations in (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007) are reproduced here for comparison. The EDO model yields time-independent transition probabilities which assume conditional inter-participant dependence (cf. Equation 3), P (qt+1 = Sj |qt = Si ) = αij · (16) P (kqt+1k = nj, kqt+1 · qtk = oij |kqtk = ni) , where ni ≡ kSik and nj ≡ kSjk, with kSk yielding the number of participants in ■ in the multiparticipant state S. In other words, ni and nj are the numbers of participants simultaneously speaking in states Si and Sj, respectively. The elements of the binary product S = S1 · S2 are given by S [k] ≡ ( ■, if S1 [k] = S2 [k] = ■ (17) t❑, otherwi</context>

The EDO model mitigates R-specificity because it models each bigram (qt−1, qt) = (Si, Sj) as the modified bigram (ni, [oij, nj]), involving three scalars each of which is a sum — a commutative (and therefore rotation-invariant) operation. Because it sums across only those participants which are in the ■ state, completely ignoring their El-state interlocutors, it can also mitigate K-specificity if one additionally redefines ni = min (kSik, Kmax ) nj = min (kSjk, Kmax ) oij = min (kSi · Sjk, ni, nj) , as in (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007). Kmax represents the maximum model-licensed degree of overlap, or the maximum number of participants allowed to be simultaneously speaking. The EDO model therefore represents a viable conversation-independent, K-independent, and R-independent model of turn-taking for the purposes in the current work4. The factor αij 4There exists some empirical evidence to suggest that conversations of K participants should not be used to train models for predicting turn-taking behavior in conversations of K′ participants, for K′ =� K, because turn-taking is inherently K-dependent.

This general applicability has been demonstrated in past work, in which the EDO model was trained on utterances for use in speech activity detection (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007), as well as in (Laskowski and Burger, 2007) where it was trained separately on talk spurts and laugh bouts, in the same data, to highlight the differences between speech and laughter deployment. Finally, it should be remembered that the EDO model is both time-independent and participantindependent. This makes it suitable for comparison of conversational genres, in much the same way as are general language models of words. Accordingly, as for language models, density estimation in future turn-taking models may be improved by considering variability across participants and in time. Participant </context>

This is due to the size of their state space, which is factorial in the number of participants. Furthermore, because such models are both specific to the number of participants and to the order in which participant states are concatenated together, it is generally intractable to train them on material from other conversations. The only such model which may be trained on other conversations is that which completely ignores interlocutor interaction. In contrast, the Extended-Degree-of-Overlap (EDO) construction of (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007) may be trained on other conversations, regardless of their number of participants, and usefully applied to approximate the turn-taking perplexity of an oracle model. This is achieved because it models entry into and egress out of specific degrees of overlap, and completely ignores the number of participants actually present or their modeled arrangement. In this sense, the EDO model can be said to implement the qualitative findings of conversation analysis. In predicting the distribution of speech in time and across participants, it reduces the unseen data perplexity of a model which ignores i</context>

Despite this seemingly dramatic simplification, it will be seen that important aspects of turn-taking are sufficiently rare to be problematic for modeling. Modeling them jointly alongside lexical information, in multi-party scenarios, is likely to remain intractable for the foreseeable future. 3.2 The Vocal Interaction Record Q The notation used here, as in (Laskowski and Schultz, 2007), is a trivial extension of that proposed in (Rabiner, 1989) to vector-valued Markov processes. At any instant t, each of K participants to a conversation is in a state drawn from IF ≡ {S0, S1} ≡ {❑, ■}, where S1 ≡ ■ indicates speech (or, more precisely, “intra-talk-spurt instants”) and S0 ≡ ❑ indicates non-speech (or “inter-talk-spurt instants”). The joint state of all participants at time t is described using the K-length column vector qt ∈ 1pK ≡ 1p × lp × ... × lp ≡ {S0, S1, ... , S2x−1 } .

In particular, each factor is a function only of the state Si in which the conversation was at time t − 1 and the state Sj in which the conversation is at time t, and not of the instants t − 1 or t. It may be expressed as the scalar aij which forms the ith row and jth column entry of the matrix {aij} ≡ Θ. 3.4 Perplexity In language modeling practice, one finds the likelihood P ( w |Θ ), of a word sequence w of length kwk under a model Θ, to be an inconvenient measure for comparison.

Beginning with (Brady, 1969), Markov modeling techniques over the joint speech activity of two interlocutors have been explored by both the sociolinguist and the psycholinguist community (Jaffe and Feldstein, 1970; Dabbs and Ruback, 1987). The same models have also appeared in dialogue systems (Raux, 2008). Most recently, they have been augmented with duration models in a study of the Switchboard corpus (Grothendieck et al., 2009). 4.2 The Case of K &gt; 2 Participants In the general case beyond dialogue, such models have found less traction. This is partly due to the exponential growth in the number of states as K increases, and partly due to difficulties in interpretation. The only model for arbitrary K that the author is familiar with is the GroupTalk model (Dabbs and Ruback, 1987), which is unsuitable for the purposes here as it does not scale (with K, T P (Q) = P0 · H t=1 = P0 · T .

Consequently, even in multi-party settings, automatic systems generally continue to treat participants independently, fusing information across participants relatively late in processing. This state of affairs has resulted in the nearexclusion from computational consideration and from semantic analysis of a phenomenon which occurs at the lowest level of speech exchange, namely the relative timing of the deployment of speech in arbitrary multi-party groups. This phenomenon, the implicit taking of turns at talk (Sacks et al., 1974), is important because unless participants adhere to its general rules, a conversation would simply not take place. It is therefore somewhat surprising that while most other aspects of speech enjoy a large base of computational methodologies for their study, there are few quantitative techniques for assessing the flow of turn-taking in general multi-party conversation. The current work attempts to address this problem by proposing a simple framework, which, at least conceptually, borrows quite heavily from the standard language modeling paradigm.

On the one hand, many intertalk-spurt gaps might find themselves to be withinturn, leading to more ■ entries in the record Q than observed in the current work. This would increase the apparent frequency and duration of intervals of overlap. On the other hand, alternative definitions of turn may exclude some speech activity, such as that implementing backchannels. Since backchannels are often produced in overlap 1006 with the foreground speaker, their removal may eliminate some overlap from Q. (However, as noted in (Shriberg et al., 2001), overlap rates in multi-party conversation remain high even after the exclusion of backchannels.) Both inter-talkspurt gap inclusion and backchannel exclusion are likely to yield systematic differences, and therefore to be exploitable by the investigated models in similar ways. The results presented may also be perturbed by modifying the way in which a (manually produced) talk spurt segmentation, with highprecision boundary time-stamps, is discretized to yield Q.

Accordingly, as for language models, density estimation in future turn-taking models may be improved by considering variability across participants and in time. Participant dependence is likely to be related to speakers’ social characteristics and conversational roles, while time dependence may reflect opening and closing functions, topic boundaries, and periodic turn exchange failures. In the meantime, event types such as the latter may be detectable as EDO perplexity departures, potentially recommending the model’s use for localizing conversational “hot spots” (Wrede and Shriberg, 2003). The EDO model, and turntaking models in general, may also find use in diagnosing turn-taking naturalness in spoken dialogue systems. 9 Conclusions This paper has presented a framework for quantifying the turn-taking perplexity in multi-party conversations. To begin with, it explored the consequences of modeling participants jointly by concatenating their binary speech/non-speech states into a single multi-participant vector-valued state. Analysis revealed that such models are particularly poor at generalization, even to subsequent portions of the same conversation. This is due to the size of</context>

For example, a “yeah” produced by a listener to indicate attentiveness, referred to as a backchannel (Yngve, 1970), is often considered to not implement a turn (nor to delineate an ongoing turn of an interlocutor), as it bears no propositional content and does not “take the floor” from the current speaker. To avoid being tied to any particular sociolinguistic theory, the current work equates “turn” with any contiguous interval of speech uttered by the same participant. Such intervals are commonly referred to as talk spurts (Norwine and Murphy, 1938). Because Norwine and Murphy’s original definition is somewhat ambiguous and non-trivial to operationalize, this work relies on that proposed by (Shriberg et a</context>
