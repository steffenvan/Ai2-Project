Book Reviews Phonological Parsing in Speech Recognition
engineering standpoint) of an architecture that provides a
clear separation of linguistic and nonlinguistic knowledge,
since it is hard to see how shallow processing could be
implemented without this separation.
Although SPAR is implemented as a complete natural
language system, it unfortunately still has something of a
&amp;quot;toy&amp;quot; flavor for two reasons. First of all, the data texts were
written specifically for this project, although not by people
who knew about SPAR. Although many of the phenomena
in these texts undoubtedly occur in more realistic texts, the
work would perhaps have been more convincing had Carter
used texts written for other purposes. Naturally occurring
texts often contain problematic constructions such as nomi-
nalizations, which present many interesting challenges for
semantics and anaphor resolution in natural language sys-
tems (Dahl et al. 1987), but which don&apos;t occur in Carter&apos;s
texts. The system also has a toy flavor because the end
application, paraphrase, is less obviously useful than many
other applications that might have been selected. There is
no reason to think that these problems affect the fundamen-
tal soundness of the work, but they do tend to make it less
interesting.
This work presents a very comprehensive implementa-
tion of the state of the art of reference resolution in natural
language processing. However, one is left at the end with a
frustrating sense that the whole process consists of exploit-
ing a set of more or less unrelated heuristics, which in fact
lead to very accurate reference resolution, but which don&apos;t
seem to fit together into a general picture of a unified
phenomenon. For example, Carter points out (using Sid-
ner&apos;s terminology) that the discourse focus is preferred to
intra-sentential candidates, but that intra-sentential candi-
dates are preferred to potential discourse foci. It is only
natural to wonder why these preferences (and others)
should be the way they are, and whether they can be
expected to fall out from more general principles. This is
not specifically a criticism of Carter, but points out an
unsatisfying aspect of much computational work in ana-
phora resolution. It is in fact at least partially the result of
the clarity of his presentation that this issue emerges.
I found this book very stimulating, interesting, and clear.
I would recommend it to anyone interested in reference
resolution or computational pragmatics in general.

Church argues against the so-called &amp;quot;standard position&amp;quot; in
speech recognition, i.e. the use of syntactic—semantic knowl-
edge to disambiguate uncertain sounds in utterances. The
argument proceeds by showing first that allophonic varia-
tion in speech is a source of useful information and not an
obstacle for speech recognition. The claim sounds reason-
able, but is not trivial because much of the work in the past
was based on an opposite view. A part of this claim is that
allophonic cues often indicate the location of boundaries
(Nakatani&apos;s position).
Another important issue in the book is that syllable
structure is very useful as a framework for describing
allophonic variation. This is also a very reasonable claim
from the linguistic point of view, but it is something that
many of the leading current phonological theories fail to
achieve.
The author assumes a constituency hypothesis where
many allophonic and phonological processes share the same
environments (e.g. foot-initial, foot-internal). This is done
in a phrase-structure and chart-parsing framework. The
Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 45

chart parsing is reduced into a set of matrix operations
dealing with sparse matrices. Appendices list sample gram-
mars and lexicons, which brings substance to the claims.
&amp;quot;Speech&amp;quot; in this book refers to English only, which is
never made explicit. This seems to be the normal case in
American literature, however. Of course, most of the contri-
bution is relevant to other languages as well.
The book also provides an interesting contribution in the
area of finite-state properties of language, because the
phrase structure grammars used are essentially finite-state.
Other finite-state accounts (such as the two-level model by
Koskenniemi [1984] and cascaded transducers by Kaplan
and Kay [Kay 1983] seem to have been less successful in
combining structural information with segmental pro-
cesses. Both other models are purely segmental, although
syllables are sometimes referred to as contexts.
An interesting problem concerning rule interaction in the
proposed formalism is dealt with on page 113. There would
be an obvious need for subtraction (for defining negative
contexts) and intersection (combining effects). Subtrac-
tion, however, turns out to exclude too much, whereas
intersection is too permissive.
The book is well written and the argumentation proceeds
logically. Both strong and weak points of the theories
proposed are clearly presented. It gives a fair overall pic-
ture of the field of speech recognition, and much of the book
could be suitable as a textbook. Nevertheless, some pas-
sages address mostly readers with a considerable back-
ground. The main topic covers, of course, a specific slice of
the whole field, namely the treatment of allophonic varia-
tion. One minor inconvenience is the use of a reference
format that cites a number only, not the author and the
year. This results in a small savings in space but a larger
burden for the reader. The book appears to be Church&apos;s
(previously unpublished) doctoral dissertation from MIT,
though this is not clearly indicated in the volume. Although
not particularly new, it still is very valuable.

Most research in natural language processing (NLP) con-
centrates on the syntax and semantics of written language,
a situation that exists in part because most NLP applica-
tions are concerned with systems that rely on written
language analysis, e.g. information retrieval and text-
generation systems. Recently, however, we have begun to
see a growing interest in spoken language and the applica-
tion of natural language processing to text-to-speech synthe-
sis and speech recognition. Waibel&apos;s volume, which de-
scribes new results in automated speech recognition, makes
an important contribution to this research direction.
At present, speech recognition technology gives us two
choices: speaker-independent systems that handle small
vocabularies (one to five phonetically distinct words) and
require no training, or speaker-dependent systems that
recognize somewhat larger vocabularies (up to 1,000 words
online) and require training sessions for each user. Al-
though experimental systems can recognize limited contin-
uous speech, freely generated phrases and sentences cannot
be processed, nor can words that are &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; to a
recognizer. Waibel believes that this condition can change
if recognition systems, which currently focus on identifying
acoustic phonetic segments, are expanded to include pro-
sodic information, i.e. information about nonsegmental
features such as duration and pitch. His central claim is
that a system equipped with prosody rules can achieve very
large vocabulary recognition, up to 20,000 words, in both
continuous speech and isolated word tasks. To make his
point, Waibel examines four prosodic features—duration,
intensity, pitch, and stress. For each feature, he discusses in
detail a series of experiments that demonstrate the tech-
niques that he used (and, in some cases, invented) for
extracting the prosodic features, and rules that use prosodic
feature patterns to narrow the search space for word hypoth-
esization to a small subset of the total vocabulary. Waibel&apos;s
results make a convincing case that prosody can play a
valuable role in machine perception of speech; however,
they fall short of establishing his strongest claims, as he
lacks a complete implementation of the system.
Most of the book is organized around each of the pro-
sodic features that Waibel investigates. His explication is
