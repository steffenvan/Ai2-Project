In the course of his long career, Victor Yngve has become seriously disenchanted
with the unempirical character of modern linguistics. Within the discipline as it has
developed,
there seems to be no scientific way of deciding among the many
contenders.... We find positions and methods being promoted like
a new movie or defended with withering polemics or taken up like
the latest fad ...
Most readers will recognize what Yngve is complaining about. For many of us who
see it as a serious problem, the response has been to become &amp;quot;corpus linguists.&amp;quot; The
implications of the phrase seem a little odd (surely we would not expect to find that
geography, say, included a specialism of &amp;quot;data geography&amp;quot; alongside a larger band of
geographers who based their theories on guesswork or &amp;quot;intuition&amp;quot;?); but in practice
&amp;quot;corpus linguistics&amp;quot; functions as a convenient shelter beneath which scientific linguistic
research can proceed, undisturbed by the weird and wonderful things happening in
areas of linguistics where people make their examples up out of their heads.
To Yngve, this is an insufficiently radical response to the empiricism problem. Even
corpus linguists routinely depend on concepts such as &amp;quot;word,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;noun,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;sentence,&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;utterance,&amp;quot; which have no clear correlates in observable reality. Yngve surveys
the origins of grammatical thought in the classical tradition and points out, correctly,
that the grammatical categories still used today derive largely from concepts devel-
oped in connection with universal, a priori laws of logic rather than with description
of contingent, concrete realities. He therefore sees any discourse that uses these con-
cepts as doomed to be unscientific. Yngve&apos;s solution is that we should &amp;quot;abandon ...
logical-domain theories entirely and mov[e] to the physical domain.&amp;quot; We can observe
the physical patterns of airwaves transmitted from speakers to hearers, as well as ob-
serving people as mobile bodies and the inanimate furniture of the environments in
which speech occurs. Yngve outlines an abstract notation suitable to record lawlike
relationships among properties of these physical complexes. &amp;quot;Because this notation
can be programmed on a computer it can be used to test large-scale ... models&amp;quot;; and,
because it refers to fundamental phenomena below the level of linguistic controver-
sies, it &amp;quot;can be freely shared among different linguists.... Gone will be the babel of
arbitrary grammatical notations, each to be discarded in turn.&amp;quot;
Yngve deserves credit for taking seriously the negative implications of these ideas
for his own past work. By far Yngve&apos;s best-known contribution is his Depth Hypothesis
(Yngve 1960, 1961), which identified an asymmetry in the incidence of left-branching
and right-branching grammatical structures. In the present book, Yngve discusses this

hypothesis at length, but concludes that &amp;quot;the depth hypothesis, as originally formu-
lated [and he gives no new formulation], cannot be tested scientifically. Science rejects
untestable hypotheses.&amp;quot;
But the fact that linguistic terminology originated in logical discourse does nothing
in itself to establish the unscientific status of modern linguistics. Quite a lot of sound
science can trace its roots to abstract philosophizing in an earlier age. Four centuries
ago, people &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; that the planets travelled in circles, since this was the only geom-
etry fit for inhabitants of the heavenly realm; that does not turn twentieth-century as-
tronomers into unscientific phantasists. Yngve&apos;s Depth Hypothesis was highly testable
in the Popperian sense that it identified potential phenomena which, if observed,
would refute it. Indeed (although Yngve does not mention this), it has periodically
been tested and refined. Fodor, Bever, and Garrett (1974, pp. 414-415) claimed, con-
trary to Yngve, that languages differ in their degrees of left-branchingness, giving
measures to several decimal places for four languages. (Regrettably, there is a gap in
their literature citation at this point.) Using corpus data of a kind not available to
Yngve in 1960, I recently found (Sampson 1997) that the precise constraint in English
is subtly different from what Yngve envisaged, and statistically exact in a way that
I could not have anticipated before doing the research. If this was not an empirical
scientific finding, I do not know what type of discourse it is—it is nothing like a priori
logical analysis.
Yngve&apos;s critique of current linguistics might seem compelling if he made a good
case for the superior empirical status of his &amp;quot;physical-domain&amp;quot; alternative. But we are
told little about the specific properties that would be filled in to turn Yngve&apos;s abstract
notation into a substantial science. Quite a lot of the discussion involves examples
not relating to language, such as the binary property of being or not being &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in the
children&apos;s chasing game that Yngve calls &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; and I call &amp;quot;touch.&amp;quot; Yngve says that a
hearer&apos;s property of being &amp;quot;on the spot to answer a question&amp;quot; (that is, of recognizing
that one has been asked a question and the conversational ball is in one&apos;s own court)
is similarly binary:
We might be tempted to say that Sue&apos;s change from being not on the
spot to being on the spot is a gradual continuous change starting when
Tom says &amp;quot;Why ... &amp;quot; and ending when he finishes asking the question.
But treating it as a continuous variable does not make sense because
we cannot see anything but a binary distinction in [Sue]&apos;s change in
behavior.
Yngve seems to imply that being &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in a game of touch or being &amp;quot;on the spot to
answer a question&amp;quot; are theory-free predicates directly tied to observable correlates in
a way that terminology such as &amp;quot;utterance&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;noun&amp;quot; is not. That is surely untenable.
In the question case, we are not told what question Tom asks, but it is very easy to
imagine cases where Sue&apos;s behavior changes observably before Tom reaches the end
of his question (or where she ignores the question when it is complete).
Where Yngve&apos;s examples are linguistic, they are often very untypical. Many pages
are devoted to the use of language between waitresses and cooks in a fast-food outlet
where only 18 valid messages are available, but Noam Chomsky rightly pointed out
40 years ago that it is of the essence of natural language grammar to permit more
than a small finite number of combinations. Most damagingly of all, to my mind,
while Yngve stresses that speech is a &amp;quot;physical-domain&amp;quot; airwave phenomenon, in
practice he takes for granted that it can be represented by words transcribed in the
ordinary way. Anyone who keeps abreast of research on automatic speech recogni-

tion knows that the relationship between physical speech signals and orthographic
forms is massively complex—even though researchers in that domain do assume that,
much of the time at least, speech signals are intended as realizations of specific se-
quences of words, which for Yngve is an impermissible assumption. The community of
speech researchers are investigating a very difficult domain in a thoroughly scientific
spirit, without the faddishness or personality cults of which Yngve understandably
complains in connection with theoretical linguistics. It is anyone&apos;s guess what speech
researchers could achieve, if they were required to relate airwave patterns not to dic-
tionary words but to observable changes in hearers&apos; behavior; my guess is that they
could achieve virtually nothing.
Yngve&apos;s basic error lies in moving from the proposition that linguistics needs to
be more empirical to the proposition that it needs to be methodologically more or less
identical to physics. Sciences of different domains are, and must be, different. Yngve
explicitly asserts that the paradigm for any empirical science should be &amp;quot;the so-called
hard sciences of physics, chemistry, and much of biology.&amp;quot; I do not know where he
means to draw the line between paradigm-worthy and other aspects of biology, but
one very central area of that science is evolutionary biology, and it is notorious that
evolutionary biology fails to conform to models of scientific method suggested by
other hard sciences. The evolution of species resembles the history of a nation, as a
succession of unique events, more than a physical system in which conjunctions of
the same variables recur again and again; and the fundamental principle of survival
of the fittest is arguably circular, since fitness may not be definable independently
of survival. (These matters are discussed well by Ruse [1973], for example.) Do we
conclude that evolutionary biologists are just fooling around rather than behaving
as responsible scientists? Surely not; they are conforming as well as possible to the
precepts of empirical science, in a domain in which that is not as easily done as in
physics or chemistry.
In the linguistics of the last third of the twentieth century there has been a genuine
problem, but it is not as fundamental as Yngve portrays it. The fact that linguists&apos; the-
ories so often nowadays seem to be &amp;quot;maintained by philosophical argument, polemics,
or social pressure&amp;quot; more than by empirical evidence is a consequence of the historical
accident that the discipline has allowed itself to be dominated by a few very pow-
erful personalities who happen not to be strongly attached to the scientific ethos (cf.
Pullum 1996). Linguistics could recover from this malady without needing to give up
everything it knows about utterances, nouns, relative clauses, and so forth. I do not
believe linguistics can ever be very similar to physics; but, since Yngve recognizes the
importance of a long historical perspective in thinking about the problems of scientific
method, I should like to commend one of the wisest observations I know on that topic:
It is a mark of the trained mind never to expect more precision in
the treatment of any subject than the nature of that subject permits.
(Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1094b 24-5)

Gone will be the babel of arbitrary grammatical notations, each to be discarded in turn.&amp;quot; Yngve deserves credit for taking seriously the negative implications of these ideas for his own past work. By far Yngve&apos;s best-known contribution is his Depth Hypothesis (Yngve 1960, 1961), which identified an asymmetry in the incidence of left-branching and right-branching grammatical structures. In the present book, Yngve discusses this 173 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 1 hypothesis at length, but concludes that &amp;quot;the depth hypothesis, as originally formulated [and he gives no new formulation], cannot be tested scientifically. Science rejects untestable hypotheses.&amp;quot; But the fact that linguistic terminology originated in logical discourse does nothing in itself to establish the unscientific status of modern linguistics. Quite a lot of sound science can trac</context>
