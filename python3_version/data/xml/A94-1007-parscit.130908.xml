The authors propose a model for analyz-
ing English sentences including coordinate
conjunctions such as &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;or&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;but&amp;quot; and
the equivalent words. Syntactic analysis
of the English coordinate sentences is one
of the most difficult problems for machine
translation (MT) systems. The problem
is selecting, from all possible candidates,
the correct syntactic structure formed by
an individual coordinate conjunction, i.e.
determining which constituents are coor-
dinated by the conjunction. Typically, so
many possible structures are produced that
MT systems cannot select the correct one,
even if the grammars allow to write the
rules in the simple notations. This pa-
per presents an English coordinate struc-
ture analysis model, which provides top-
down scope information of the correct syn-
tactic structure by taking advantage of the
symmetric patterns of the parallelism. The
model is based on a balance matching oper-
ation for two lists of the feature sets, which
provides four effects: the reduction of anal-
ysis cost, the improvement of word dis-
ambiguation, the interpretation of ellipses,
and robust analysis. This model was prac-
tically implemented and incorporated into
the English-Japanese MT system, and pro-
vided about 75% accuracy in the practical

This paper presents a model for analyzing English
sentences including coordinate conjunctions such as
&amp;quot;and&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;or&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;but&amp;quot; and equivalent words.
Syntactic analysis of English coordinate sentences
is one of the most difficult problems for machine
translation (MT) systems. The problem is select-
ing, from all possible candidates, the correct syn-
tactic structure formed by an individual coordinate
conjunction, i.e., determining which constituents are
conjoined by the conjunction. Although the con-
junction appears to have a simple function in the
English language, it has been researched as a con-
junct scope problem by both theoretical and com-
putational linguists. Theoretically, it is possible to
describe the syntactic and semantic constraints that
govern the acceptability of a structure in which two
constituents are conjoined by the conjunction(Lesmo
and Torasso, 1985; Gazdar, 1981; Schachter, 1977).
Computationally, it is possible to describe the gram-
mar and heuristic rules for these constraints by
ATN networks, logic grammars, HPSG, and cate-
gorical grammars(Kosy, 1986; Fong and Berwick,
1985; Huang, 1984; Boguraev et al., 1983; Blackwell,
1981; Niimi et al., 1986). However, it is not easy to
apply these techniques to large-scale MT systems,
because there exist a variety of conjoined patterns,
many word ambiguities, some unknown words and
ellipses of the words simultaneously, in real environ-
ments. Also, there may be several conjunctions and
the equivalent words, such as commas, in a single
sentence. Typically, the methods produce so many
possible structures that MT systems cannot select
the correct one, even if the grammars allow to write
the rules in the simple notations.
Often, conjunctions might produce the reading
difficulty even for the human readers. However, they
also give the readers a kind of symmetry as a read-
ing indication. They exhibit the tendency to con-
join the same kind of syntactic patterns, which has
been called &amp;quot;parallelism&amp;quot; (Beaugrande and Dressler,
1981; Shinoda, 1981). In Japanese, the similar-
ity is used for analyzing conjunctive structures and
the method is found effective(Kurohashi and Nagao,
1992). While Japanese language has several coordi-
nate conjunctions according to the syntactic levels
(a noun phrase and a predicative clause), English
coordinate conjunctions are used for any level of the
structures. More robust methods are necessary for
dealing with English conjunctive structures.
We propose here an English coordinate structure
analysis model, which can determine the correct syn-
tactic structure in real environments by taking ad-
vantage of the symmetric patterns of the parallelism.

The model is based on a balance matching operation
for two lists of the feature sets. The lists represent
the left-side and right-side structures of the coordi-
nate conjunctions, including word ambiguities. The
operation determines the most symmetric structure
by comparing both sides of the conjunction.
First, the problems of the English coordinate sen-
tences are explained. Second, it is mentioned that
the parallelism can be effective information for top-
down analysis of the sentences. Third, the balance
matching analysis model is presented for solving the
problems. This model, which was implemented in
the PIVOT English-Japanese MT system with the
dictionary of 100,000 words, has been working in
the analysis module. Finally, the results in the MT
system are reported together with the MT system
configuration.

2 Problems of the conjunctions
Coordinate conjunctions for MT systems present
three difficulties(Kosy, 1986; Huang, 1983; Niimi et
al., 1986; Okumura et al., 1987).
1. Analysis cost: English coordinate conjunctions
have a variety of linguistic functions. The con-
junctions can syntactically conjoin any parts
of speech; nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc., and
all sorts of constituents; words, phrases and
clauses. They produce so many possible struc-
tures that MT systems cannot select the correct
one, even if some grammars provide the simple
notations of the rules. The complexity of the
rules impose a burden on the analysis process.
2. Ambiguities of the words: Most English words
are ambiguous in their parts of speech ,such as
Noun and Verb, Preposition and Conjunction,
Auxiliary Verb and others, and Adjective and
Noun. The complex rules governing the con-
junctions make the word disambiguation more
complicated, which results in the reduction of
analysis precision.
3. Ellipses of the words: It is possible for a con-
junct to contain &amp;quot;gaps&amp;quot; (elided elements) which
are not allowed if the conjunction is removed.
These gaps must be filled with elements from
other conjunct for a proper interpretation, as
in (1) and (1)&apos;.
(1) NO.2 landing gear selector valves should be
closed to the full position,and NO.3 to the half.
(1)&apos; NO.2 landing gear selector valves should be
closed to the full position, and NO.3 [landing
gear selector valves should be closed] to the half
[position].
3 Parallelism of the conjunctions
3.1 Symmetric patterns of parallelism
English coordinate conjunctions have a tendency to
conjoin the same kinds of syntactic patterns. We
identify three levels of symmetric pattern.
• Phrase(Clause) syrnmetric patterns:
Phrase(Clause)-level symmetric patters such as
[Verb-Phase AND Verb-Phase] in the conjunct
scope of &amp;quot;as well as &amp;quot;in (2) and a series of com-
mas in (3).
(2) Such coupling is desirable because it enables a
development engineer to move easily within this
hierarchy as well as to exploit the distinctive
features of each system.
(3) The add operators cause POSTSCRIPT to pick
up the top two numbers from the stack, re-
move them, add them, and leave the sum on
the stack. -
• Word symmetric patterns: Word-level sym-
metric patterns such as [Quantifier Preposi-
tion Abstract-Noun AND Quantifier Preposi-
tion Abstract-Noun] in the conjunct scope of
the &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; in (4). Some patterns are represented
by the semantic features such as [Instrument
AND Instrument] about &amp;quot;andi&amp;quot; of (5).
(4) The container need not be large; if it is /0cm in
diameter and 12cm in depth, that is enough.
(5) Inspect the cockpit indicators andi levers for
cracked glass and missing control knobs.
• Morphological symmetric patterns: Morpholog-
ical symmetric patterns are recognized by the
sorts of characters, uppercase or lowercase let-
ters, as in (6) and (7) as well as an exactly same
morphological pattern [CIC ... hatches AND
CIC ..., hatches] in (8).
(6) An atomic bomb is a device for producing
an explosively rapid neutron chain reaction in
uranium-235 or plutonium-239 which is called
a fissile material.
(7) Technical orders described in AFR 8-2 and
PFR 7-2 are registered in the on-line file in the
form of inspection workcards.
(8) There are GIG&apos; ditching2 hatches3 and CIC4
escape5 hatches6 in the compartment.
Some symmetric patterns may appear in com-
bined form [Preposition Gerund Nominal-Phrase
AND Preposition Gerund Nominal-Phrase] in (9).
(9) Radioisotopes have played an important part
ini developing effective insecticides in2 the
country and in3 finding the best ways of ap-
plying them.

-3.2 Analysis by the symmetric patterns
The symmetric patterns can be effective information
for top-down analysis of the conjunct scope. For ex-
ample, though (9) allows another counterpart (&amp;quot;in2
the country&amp;quot;) as the conjoined phrase (&amp;quot;in3 find-
ing ...&amp;quot;), the symmetric pattern information makes
it easy to to select the correct counterpart of the
phrase (&amp;quot;ini developing ....&amp;quot; ). Also, where other ex-
amples syntactically allow other counterparts of the
conjoined noun phrases, the symmetric pattern in-
formation enables easy selection. Often, the scope of
each conjunct is explicitly demarcated with commas
and morphological patterns, as in (3) and (8). The
symmetric patterns can be also effective for word dis-
ambiguation. For example, (8) contains verb/noun
ambiguities for escape5 and hatches6. The symmet-
ric patterning of ditching2 hatches3 facilitates their
disambiguation.
In the above example sentences, the words im-
mediately following the conjunction play important
roles for detecting the structures, because there is
usually strong similarity between the starting words
of each conjunct scope and the words following the
conjunctions. However, the following examples also
contain kinds of symmetric patterns, though the
words following the conjunctions don&apos;t have similar-
ity with the starting words of the conjunct scopes.

In both (10) and (11), an adverbial modifier is
inserted at the start of the second conjunct; this
is a common pattern extension. In (12), there is
no real parallelism: the first conjunct clause is an
imperative, and the second its result.

The model was incorporated as a balance matching
module into the PIVOT English-Japanese MT sys-
tem as shown in Figure.1(Muraki, 1986; Okumura et
al., 1987; Okumura et al., 1991). The system works
for a practical use together with the dictionary of
100,000 words.
The input sentences, represented by the list of
the feature sets based on the results of the mor-
phological analysis, are transferred to the balance
matching module. The module produces the con-
junct scope information as well as the results of the
balance matching. The syntactic-semantic analysis
module analyzes the sentences according to this top-
down information. After the analysis, the concep-
tual analysis module creates an interlingua repre-
sentation. From the interlingua, output sentences
are generated(Muraki, 1986; Okumura et al., 1991).

5.2 Effects of the model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.884646153846154">
When 15,000 conjunctive sentences in the technical
reports and manuals were translated apart from the
analyzed 10,000 sentences, the following effects are
confirmed about the model.
1. Reduction of the analysis cost: This model pro-
vides the correct top-down information about
the conjunct scopes for about 75% of the sen-
tences, which result in the accurate and effective
syntactic analysis. Most of the sentences had
required backtracking for the analysis without
the model. The backtracking is almost all sup-
pressed by the model.
2. Improvement of the word disambiguation: The
results of the balance matching improve word
disambiguation and the inferences of the un-
known words, because the ambiguities of each
word are intersected by the counterparts of the
symmetric list. The results provide top-down
information for the analysis of the ambiguous
words and unknown words, as in (8). Most of
the sentences contained some word ambiguities
and one sixth contained unknown words. By
using the top-down information, the accuracy
was twice better improved.
3. Interpretation of the ellipses: The model makes
it easy to interpret the elided elements, because
the balance matching results can suggest the
missing elements. In sentences such as (1), R.
is completely included r. The differences of
and R. complement the missing elements.
4. Robust analysis: The model helps make the sys-
tem robust because the balance matching op-
eration is based on the three different kinds of
features. In the MT domain of technical reports
and manuals, there are some unknown words as
well as some ambiguous words as in (6),(7) and
(8). Robustness is achieved because the mor-
phological features are considered as well as the
other features.

5.3 Discussions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.951633034482759">
To increase the accuracy, the model is improved from
three points:
• Lexical disambiguation: The model is based
on lexical information. Therefore, when many
words provide too many feature ambiguities,
the model cannot always determine a correct
structure. In order to solve this problem, filter-
ing rules are applied to the sentence before the
balance matching operation. The rules are local
constraint rules, which checks the two or three
words before a focused word to remove some
ambiguities of the focused word. The filtering
rules improve the model.
• Weight optimization: The weights for each fea-
ture set are manually assigned based on 300 pat-
terns. They should be more appropriately as-
signed as real values instead of binary values ac-
cording to the domain and text styles. We have
developed a learning method for the feature
structures(Okumura et al., 1992). The method
is applicable for determining the weights ac-
cording to the input patterns.
• Semantic calculation: Some conjunctive struc-
tures should be analyzed by the more subdi-
vided semantic features and semantic similarity
calculation. We are introducing some semantic
taxonomy and the semantic distance measure-
ment algorithm(Knight, 1993; Okumura and
Hovy, 1994; Resnik, 1993).

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976111111111">
The authors propose an English coordinate struc-
ture analysis model, which provides top-down scope
information of the correct syntactic structure by tak-
ing advantage of the symmetric patterns of the par-
allelism.
This model was practically implemented and in-
corporated into the PIVOT English-Japanese MT

<abstract confidence="0.9997683125">The authors propose a model for analyzing English sentences including coordinate conjunctions such as &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;or&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;but&amp;quot; and the equivalent words. Syntactic analysis of the English coordinate sentences is one of the most difficult problems for machine translation (MT) systems. The problem is selecting, from all possible candidates, the correct syntactic structure formed by an individual coordinate conjunction, i.e. determining which constituents are coordinated by the conjunction. Typically, so many possible structures are produced that MT systems cannot select the correct one, even if the grammars allow to write the rules in the simple notations. This paper presents an English coordinate structure analysis model, which provides topdown scope information of the correct syntactic structure by taking advantage of the symmetric patterns of the parallelism. The model is based on a balance matching operation for two lists of the feature sets, which provides four effects: the reduction of analysis cost, the improvement of word disambiguation, the interpretation of ellipses, and robust analysis. This model was practically implemented and incorporated into the English-Japanese MT system, and provided about 75% accuracy in the practical translation use.</abstract>

Also, there may be several conjunctions and the equivalent words, such as commas, in a single sentence. Typically, the methods produce so many possible structures that MT systems cannot select the correct one, even if the grammars allow to write the rules in the simple notations. Often, conjunctions might produce the reading difficulty even for the human readers. However, they also give the readers a kind of symmetry as a reading indication. They exhibit the tendency to conjoin the same kind of syntactic patterns, which has been called &amp;quot;parallelism&amp;quot; (Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981; Shinoda, 1981). In Japanese, the similarity is used for analyzing conjunctive structures and the method is found effective(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1992). While Japanese language has several coordinate conjunctions according to the syntactic levels (a noun phrase and a predicative clause), English coordinate conjunctions are used for any level of the structures. More robust methods are necessary for dealing with English conjunctive structures. We propose here an English coordinate structure analysis model, which can determine the correct syntactic structure in real environments by taking advanta</context>

They should be more appropriately assigned as real values instead of binary values according to the domain and text styles. We have developed a learning method for the feature structures(Okumura et al., 1992). The method is applicable for determining the weights according to the input patterns. • Semantic calculation: Some conjunctive structures should be analyzed by the more subdivided semantic features and semantic similarity calculation. We are introducing some semantic taxonomy and the semantic distance measurement algorithm(Knight, 1993; Okumura and Hovy, 1994; Resnik, 1993). 6 Conclusion The authors propose an English coordinate structure analysis model, which provides top-down scope information of the correct syntactic structure by taking advantage of the symmetric patterns of the parallelism.

Also, there may be several conjunctions and the equivalent words, such as commas, in a single sentence. Typically, the methods produce so many possible structures that MT systems cannot select the correct one, even if the grammars allow to write the rules in the simple notations. Often, conjunctions might produce the reading difficulty even for the human readers. However, they also give the readers a kind of symmetry as a reading indication. They exhibit the tendency to conjoin the same kind of syntactic patterns, which has been called &amp;quot;parallelism&amp;quot; (Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981; Shinoda, 1981). In Japanese, the similarity is used for analyzing conjunctive structures and the method is found effective(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1992). While Japanese language has several coordinate conjunctions according to the syntactic levels (a noun phrase and a predicative clause), English coordinate conjunctions are used for any level of the structures. More robust methods are necessary for dealing with English conjunctive structures. We propose here an English coordinate structure analysis model, which can determine the correct syntactic structure in real environments by taking advantage of the symmet</context>
