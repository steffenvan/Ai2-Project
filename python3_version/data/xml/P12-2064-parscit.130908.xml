<bodyText confidence="0.99979475">
We introduce a novel method for
grammatical error correction with a number
of small corpora. To make the best use of
several corpora with different
characteristics, we employ a meta-learning
with several base classifiers trained on
different corpora. This research focuses on
a grammatical error correction task for
article errors. A series of experiments is
presented to show the effectiveness of the
proposed approach on two different
grammatical error tagged corpora.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973761836363637">
As language learning has drawn significant
attention in the community, grammatical error
correction (GEC), consequently, has attracted a fair
amount of attention. Several organizations have
built diverse resources including grammatical error
(GE) tagged corpora.
Although there are some publicly released GE
tagged corpora, it is still challenging to train a
good GEC model due to the lack of large GE
tagged learner corpus. The available GE tagged
corpora are mostly small datasets having different
characteristics depending on the development
methods, e.g. spoken corpus vs. written corpus.
This situation forced researchers to utilize native
corpora rather than GE tagged learner corpora for
the GEC task.
The native corpus approach consists of learning
a model that predicts the correct form of an article
given the surrounding context. Some researchers
focused on mining better features from the
linguistic and pedagogic knowledge, whereas
others focused on testing different classification
methods (Knight and Chandler, 1994; Minnen et
al., 2000; Lee, 2004; Nagata et al., 2006; Han et al.,
2006; De Felice, 2008).
Recently, a group of researchers introduced
methods utilizing a GE tagged learner corpus to
derive more accurate results (Han et al., 2010;
Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010). Since the two
approaches are closely related to each other, they
can be informative to each other. For example,
Dahlmeier and Ng (2011) proposed a method that
combines a native corpus and a GE tagged learner
corpus and it outperformed models trained with
either a native or GE tagged learner corpus alone.
However, methods which train a GEC model from
various GE tagged corpora have received less
focus.
In this paper, we present a novel approach to the
GEC task using meta-learning. We focus mainly
on article errors for two reasons. First, articles are
one of the most significant sources of GE for the
learners with various L1 backgrounds. Second, the
effective features for article error correction are
already well engineered allowing for quick
analysis of the method. Our approach is
distinguished from others by integrating the
predictive models trained on several GE tagged
learner corpora, rather than just one GE tagged
corpus. Moreover, the framework is compatible to
any classification technique. In this study, we also
use a native corpus employing Dahlmeier and Ng’s
approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method against baseline models in article
error correction tasks.

2. Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993772727273">
Our method predicts the type of article for a noun
phrase within three classes: null, definite, and
indefinite. A correction arises when the prediction
disagrees with the observed article. The
meta-learning technique is applied to this task to
deal with multiple corpora obtained from different
sources.
A meta-classifier decides the final output based
on the intermediate results obtained from several
base classifiers. Each base classifier is trained on a
different corpus than are the other classifiers. In
this work, the feature extraction processes used for
the base classifiers are identical to each other for
simplicity, although they need not necessarily be
identical. The meta-classifier takes the output
scores of the base classifiers as its input and is
trained on the held-out development data (Figure
1a). During run time, the trained classifiers are
organized in the same manner. For the given
features, the base classifiers independently
calculate the score, then the meta-classifier makes
the final decision based on the scores (Figure 1b).

2.1. Meta-learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993">
Meta-learning is a sequential learning process
following the output of other base learners
(classifiers). Normally, different classifiers
successfully predict results on different parts of the
input space, so researchers have often tried to
combine different classifiers together (Breiman,
1996; Cohen et al., 2007; Zhang, 2007; Aydõn,
2009; Menahem et al., 2009). To capitalize on the
strengths and compensate for the weaknesses of
each classifier, we build a meta-learner that takes
an input vector consisting of the outputs of the
base classifiers. The performance of meta-learning
can be improved using output probabilities for
every class label from the base classifiers.
The meta-classifier for the proposed method
consists of multiple linear classifiers. Each
classifier takes an input vector consisting of the
output scores of each base classifier and calculates
a score for each type of article. The meta-classifier
finally takes the class having the maximum score.
A common design of an ensemble is to train
different base classifiers with the same dataset, but
in this work one classification technique was used
with different datasets each having different
characteristics. Although only one classification
method was used in this work, different methods
each well-tuned to the individual corpora may be
used to improve the performance.
We employed the meta-learning method to
generate synergy among corpora with diverse
characteristics. More specifically, it is shown by
cross validation that meta-learning performs at a
level that is comparable to the best base classifier
(Dzeroski and Zenko, 2004).

nces the overall performance. The base classifiers
can be expected to become more informative as
more data are provided. We followed the structural
learning approach (Ando and Zhang, 2005), which
trains a model from both a native corpus and a GE
tagged corpus (Dahlmeire and Ng, 2011), to
improve the base classifiers by the additional
information extracted from a native corpus.
Structural learning is a technique which trains
multiple classifiers with common structure. The
common structure chooses the hypothesis space of
each individual classifier and the individual
classifiers are trained separately once the
hypothesis space is determined. The common
structure can be obtained from auxiliary problems
which are closely related to the main problems.
A word selection problem is a task to predict the
appropriate word given the surrounding context in
a native corpus and is a closely related auxiliary
problem of the GEC task. We can obtain the
common structure from the article selection
problem and use it for the correction problem.
In this work, all the base classifiers used the
same least squares loss function for structural
learning. We adopted the feature set investigated
in De Felice (2008) for article error correction. We
use the Stanford coreNLP toolkit1 (Toutanova and
Manning, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2003a; Klein
and Manning, 2003b; Finkel et al, 2005) to extract
the features.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is
evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score (Dahlmeire and Ng, 2011). Accuracy
is the number of correct predictions divided by the
total number of instances. Precision is the ratio of
the suggested corrections that agree with the
tagged answer to the total number of the suggested
corrections whereas recall is the ratio of the
suggested corrections that agree with the tagged
answer to the total number of corrections in the
corpus.

news data2 which is a large English text extracted
from news articles. The First Certificate in English
exams in the Cambridge Learner Corpus 3
(hereafter, CLC-FCE; Yannakoudakis et al., 2011)
and the Japanese Learner English corpus (Izumi et.
al., 2005) were used for the GE tagged corpora.
We extracted noun phrases from each corpus by
parsing the text of the respective corpora. (1) We
parsed the native corpus from the beginning until
approximately a million noun phrases are extracted.
(2) About 90k noun phrases containing ~3,300
mistakes in article usage were extracted from the
entire CLC-FCE corpus, and (3) about 30k noun
phrases containing ~2,500 mistakes were extracted
from the JLE corpus.
The extracted noun phrases were used for our
training and test data. We hold out 10% of the data
for the test. We applied 20% under-sampling to the
training instances that do not have any errors to
alleviate data imbalance in the training set.
We emphasize the fact that the two learner
corpora differ from each other in three aspects. The
first aspect is the styles of the texts: the CLC is
literary whereas the JLE is colloquial. The second
is the error rate: about 3.5% for CLC-FCE and
8.5% for JLE. Finally, the third is the distribution
of L1 languages of the learners: the learners of the
CLC corpus have various L1 backgrounds whereas
the learners of the JLE consist of only Japanese.
These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method relying on the diversity of
the corpora.
The native corpus was used to find the common
structure using structural learning and two GE
tagged learner corpora are used to train the base
classifiers by structural learning with the common
structure obtained from the news corpus.
We trained three classifiers for comparison; (1)
the classifier (INTEG) trained with the integrated
training set of the two GE tagged corpora, and two
base classifiers used for the ensemble: (2) the base
classifier (CB) trained only with the CLC-FCE and

obtaining the parameters of the word selection task,
the structural parameter Θ was calculated by
singular value decomposition and was used for the
structural learning of the main GEC task.
We used three different test data sets: the
CLC-FCE, the JLE and an integrated test set of the
two. The accuracy (Acc.) and the precision (Prec.)
of the INTEG was poorer than CB on the CLC-
FCE test set (Table 1), whereas INTEG
outperformed JB on the JLE test (Table 2).
Some instances extracted from the CLC-FCE
corpus have similar characteristics to the instances
from the JLE corpus. This overlap of instances
affected the performance in both positive and
negative ways. Prediction of instances similar to
those in the JLE was enhanced. Consequently,
INTEG model demonstrated better accuracy and
precision for the JLE test set. Unfortunately, for
the CLC test set, the instances resulted in lower
accuracy and precision.
The proposed model is able to alleviate this
model bias due to similar instances observed in the
INTEG model. The accuracy of the proposed
model consistently increased by over 10% for all
three data sets. The relative performance gain in
terms of F1-score (F1) was 15% on the integrated
set. This performance gain stems from the over
25% relative improvement of the precision (Table
1, 2 and 3).
We believe the improvement comes from the
contribution of reconfirming procedures performed
by the meta-classifier. When the prediction of the
two base classifiers conflicts with each other, the
meta-classifier tends to choose the one with a
higher confidence score; this choice improves the
accuracy and precision because known features
generate a higher confidence whereas unseen or
less-weighted features generate a lower score.
Although the proposed model introduced a
tradeoff between precision and recall (Rec.), this
tradeoff was tolerable in order to improve the
overall F1-score. Since GEC is a task where false
alarm is critical, obtaining high precision is very
important. The low precision on the whole
experiments is due to the data imbalance. Instances
in the dataset are mostly not erroneous, e.g., only
3.5% of erroneous instances for the CLC corpus.
The standard for correct prediction is also very
strict and does not allow multiple answers.
Performance can be evaluated in a more realistic
way by applying a softer standard, e.g., by
evaluating manually.

We have presented a novel approach to
grammatical error correction by building a
meta-classifier using multiple GE tagged corpora
with different characteristics in various aspects.
The experiments showed that building a
meta-classifier overcomes the interference that
occurs when training with a set of heterogeneous
corpora. The proposed method also outperforms
the base classifier themselves tested on the same
class of test set as the training set with which the
base classifiers are trained. A better automatic
evaluation metric would be needed as further
research.

For the given features, the base classifiers independently calculate the score, then the meta-classifier makes the final decision based on the scores (Figure 1b). 2.1. Meta-learning Meta-learning is a sequential learning process following the output of other base learners (classifiers). Normally, different classifiers successfully predict results on different parts of the input space, so researchers have often tried to combine different classifiers together (Breiman, 1996; Cohen et al., 2007; Zhang, 2007; Aydõn, 2009; Menahem et al., 2009). To capitalize on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses of each classifier, we build a meta-learner that takes an input vector consisting of the outputs of the base classifiers. The performance of meta-learning can be improved using output probabilities for every class label from the base classifiers. The meta-classifier for the proposed method consists of multiple linear classifiers.

Although only one classification method was used in this work, different methods each well-tuned to the individual corpora may be used to improve the performance. We employed the meta-learning method to generate synergy among corpora with diverse characteristics. More specifically, it is shown by cross validation that meta-learning performs at a level that is comparable to the best base classifier (Dzeroski and Zenko, 2004). 2.2. Base Classifiers In the meta-learning framework, the performance of the base classifiers is important because the improvement in base classification generally enha329 nces the overall performance. The base classifiers can be expected to become more informative as more data are provided. We followed the structural learning approach (Ando and Zhang, 2005), which trains a model from both a native corpus and a GE tagged corpus (Dahlmeire and Ng, 2011), to improve the base classifiers by the additional information extracted from a native corpus.

For the given features, the base classifiers independently calculate the score, then the meta-classifier makes the final decision based on the scores (Figure 1b). 2.1. Meta-learning Meta-learning is a sequential learning process following the output of other base learners (classifiers). Normally, different classifiers successfully predict results on different parts of the input space, so researchers have often tried to combine different classifiers together (Breiman, 1996; Cohen et al., 2007; Zhang, 2007; Aydõn, 2009; Menahem et al., 2009). To capitalize on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses of each classifier, we build a meta-learner that takes an input vector consisting of the outputs of the base classifiers. The performance of meta-learning can be improved using output probabilities for every class label from the base classifiers. The meta-classifier for the proposed method consists of multiple linear classifiers. Each classifier takes an input vector consisting of the output scores of each base classifier and calculates a score for each type of article. The meta-classifier fi</context>
