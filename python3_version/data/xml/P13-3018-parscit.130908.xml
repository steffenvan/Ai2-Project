In this work we present psycholinguisti-
cally motivated computational models for
the organization and processing of Ban-
gla morphologically complex words in
the mental lexicon. Our goal is to identify
whether morphologically complex words
are stored as a whole or are they orga-
nized along the morphological line. For
this, we have conducted a series of psy-
cholinguistic experiments to build up hy-
pothesis on the possible organizational
structure of the mental lexicon. Next, we
develop computational models based on
the collected dataset. We observed that
derivationally suffixed Bangla words are
in general decomposed during processing
and compositionality between the stem
and the suffix plays an important role in
the decomposition process. We observed
the same phenomena for Bangla verb se-
quences where experiments showed non-
compositional verb sequences are in gen-
eral stored as a whole in the ML and low
traces of compositional verbs are found
in the mental lexicon.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998862294117647">
Mental lexicon is the representation of the words
in the human mind and their associations that
help fast retrieval and comprehension (Aitchison,
1987). Words are known to be associated with
each other in terms of, orthography, phonology,
morphology and semantics. However, the precise
nature of these relations is unknown.
An important issue that has been a subject of
study for a long time is to identify the fundamen-
tal units in terms of which the mental lexicon is
organized. That is, whether lexical representa-
tions in the mental lexicon are word based or are
they organized along morphological lines. For
example, whether a word such as “unimaginable”
is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word
or do we break it up “un-” , “imagine” and “-
able”, understand the meaning of each of these
constituent and then recombine the units to com-
prehend the whole word.
Such questions are typically answered by de-
signing appropriate priming experiments (Mars-
len-Wilson et al., 1994) or other lexical decision
tasks. The reaction time of the subjects for re-
cognizing various lexical items under appropriate
conditions reveals important facts about their
organization in the brain. (See Sec. 2 for models
of morphological organization and access and
related experiments).
A clear understanding of the structure and the
processing mechanism of the mental lexicon will
further our knowledge of how the human brain
processes language. Further, these linguistically
important and interesting questions are also high-
ly significant for computational linguistics (CL)
and natural language processing (NLP) applica-
tions. Their computational significance arises
from the issue of their storage in lexical re-
sources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and rais-
es the questions like, how to store morphologi-
cally complex words, in a lexical resource like
WordNet keeping in mind the storage and access
efficiency.
There is a rich literature on organization and
lexical access of morphologically complex words
where experiments have been conducted mainly
for derivational suffixed words of English, He-
brew, Italian, French, Dutch, and few other lan-
guages (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008; Frost et al.,
1997; Grainger, et al., 1991; Drews and Zwitser-
lood, 1995). However, we do not know of any
such investigations for Indian languages, which

are morphologically richer than many of their
Indo-European cousins. Moreover, Indian lan-
guages show some distinct phenomena like,
compound and composite verbs for which no
such investigations have been conducted yet. On
the other hand, experiments indicate that mental
representation and processing of morphologically
complex words are not quite language indepen-
dent (Taft, 2004). Therefore, the findings from
experiments in one language cannot be genera-
lized to all languages making it important to
conduct similar experimentations in other lan-
guages.
This work aims to design cognitively moti-
vated computational models that can explain the
organization and processing of Bangla morpho-
logically complex words in the mental lexicon.
Presently we will concentrate on the following
two aspects:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978887333333333">
• Organization and processing of Bangla Poly-
morphemic words: our objective here is to de-
termine whether the mental lexicon decompos-
es morphologically complex words into its
constituent morphemes or does it represent the
unanalyzed surface form of a word.
• Organization and processing of Bangla com-
pound verbs (CV): compound verbs are the
subject of much debate in linguistic theory. No
consensus has been reached yet with respect to
the issue that whether to consider them as uni-
tary lexical units or are they syntactically as-
sembled combinations of two independent lex-
ical units. As linguistic arguments have so far

experiments to probe the brain signatures of
verb-verb combinations and propose cognitive
as well as computational models regarding the
possible organization and processing of Bangla
CVs in the mental lexicon (ML).
With respect to this, we apply the different
priming and other lexical decision experiments,
described in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al.,
1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically
for derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words
and compound verbs of Bangla. Our cross-modal
and masked priming experiment on Bangla deri-
vationally suffixed words shows that morpholog-
ical relatedness between lexical items triggers a
significant priming effect, even when the forms
are phonologically/orthographically unrelated.
These observations are similar to those reported
for English and indicate that derivationally suf-
fixed words in Bangla are in general accessed
through decomposition of the word into its con-
stituent morphemes. Further, based on the expe-
rimental data we have developed a series of
computational models that can be used to predict
the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic
words. Our evaluation result shows that decom-
position of a polymorphemic word depends on
several factors like, frequency, productivity of
the suffix and the compositionality between the
stem and the suffix.
The organization of the paper is as follows:
Sec. 2 presents related works; Sec. 3 describes
experiment design and procedure; Sec. 4 presents
the processing of CVs; and finally, Sec. 5 con-
cludes the paper by presenting the future direc-
tion of the work.

2.1 Representation of polymorphemic words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993285714285">
Over the last few decades many studies have at-
tempted to understand the representation and
processing of morphologically complex words in
the brain for various languages. Most of the stu-
dies are designed to support one of the two mu-
tually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and
the morphemic model. The full-listing model
claims that polymorphic words are represented as
a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley,
1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand,
morphemic model argues that morphologically
complex words are decomposed and represented
in terms of the smaller morphemic units. The
affixes are stripped away from the root form,
which in turn are used to access the mental lex-
icon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981; MacK-
ay, 1978). Intermediate to these two paradigms is
the partial decomposition model that argues that
different types of morphological forms are
processed separately. For instance, the derived
morphological forms are believed to be
represented as a whole, whereas the representa-
tion of the inflected forms follows the morphem-
ic model (Caramazza et al., 1988).
Traditionally, priming experiments have been
used to study the effects of morphology in lan-
guage processing. Priming is a process that re-
sults in increase in speed or accuracy of response
to a stimulus, called the target, based on the oc-
currence of a prior exposure of another stimulus,
called the prime (Tulving et al., 1982). Here,
subjects are exposed to a prime word for a short
duration, and are subsequently shown a target
word. The prime and target words may be mor-
phologically, phonologically or semantically re-

lated. An analysis of the effect of the reaction
time of subjects reveals the actual organization
and representation of the lexicon at the relevant
level. See Pulvermüller (2002) for a detailed ac-
count of such phenomena.
It has been argued that frequency of a word in-
fluences the speed of lexical processing and thus,
can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the na-
ture and organization of lexical representations.
(Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English in-
flected words, argued that lexical decision res-
ponses of polymorphemic words depends upon
the base word frequency. Similar observation for
surface word frequency was also observed by
(Bertram et al., 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al.,
1987;Burani et al., 1984;Schreuder et al., 1997;
Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed
that words having low surface frequency tends to
decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the
dual processing race model that proposes that a
specific morphologically complex form is ac-
cessed via its parts if the frequency of that word
is above a certain threshold of frequency, then
the direct route will win, and the word will be
accessed as a whole. If it is below that same thre-
shold of frequency, the parsing route will win,
and the word will be accessed via its parts.

2.2 Representation of Compound Verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987454891891892">
A compound verb (CV) consists of a sequence of
two verbs (V1 and V2) acting as a single verb
and expresses a single expression of meaning.
For example, in the sentence
���( T C2F( Cgi(M (/ruTigulo kheYe phela/)
―bread-plural-the eat and drop-pres. Imp&amp;quot;
―Eat the breads&amp;quot;
the verb sequence “C2F( Cgi( T (eat drop)” is an
example of CV. Compound verbs are a special
phenomena that are abundantly found in Indo-
European languages like Indian languages.
A plethora of works has been done to provide
linguistic explanations on the formation of such
word, yet none so far has led to any consensus.
Hook (1981) considers the second verb V2 as an
aspectual complex comparable to the auxiliaries.
Butt (1993) argues CV formations in Hindi and
Urdu are either morphological or syntactical and
their formation take place at the argument struc-
ture. Bashir (1993) tried to construct a semantic
analysis based on “prepared” and “unprepared
mind”. Similar findings have been proposed by
Pandharipande (1993) that points out V1 and V2
are paired on the basis of their semantic compa-
tibility, which is subject to syntactic constraints.
Paul (2004) tried to represent Bangla CVs in
terms of HPSG formalism. She proposes that the
selection of a V2 by a V1 is determined at the
semantic level because the two verbs will unify if
and only if they are semantically compatible.
Since none of the linguistic formalism could sa-
tisfactorily explain the unique phenomena of CV
formation, we here for the first time drew our
attention towards psycholinguistic and neuro-
linguistic studies to model the processing of
verb-verb combinations in the ML and compare
these responses with that of the existing models.

3 The Proposed Approaches

3.1 The psycholinguistic experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961083333333">
We apply two different priming experiments
namely, the cross modal priming and masked
priming experiment discussed in (Forster and
Davis, 1984; Rastle et al., 2000;Marslen-Wilson
et al., 1994; Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) for
Bangla morphologically complex words. Here,
the prime is morphologically derived form of the
target presented auditorily (for cross modal prim-
ing) or visually (for masked priming). The sub-
jects were asked to make a lexical decision
whether the given target is a valid word in that
language. The same target word is again probed
but with a different audio or visual probe called
the control word. The control shows no relation-
ship with the target. For example, baYaska
(aged) and baYasa (age) is a prime-target pair,
for which the corresponding control-target pair
could be naYana (eye) and baYasa (age).
Similar to (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) the
masked priming has been conducted for three
different SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony),
48ms, 72ms and 120ms. The SOA is measured as
the amount of time between the start the first
stimulus till the start of the next stimulus.

either in terms of morphology, semantics, ortho-
graphy and/or Phonology (See Table 1).
The experiments were conducted on 24 highly
educated native Bangla speakers. Nineteen of
them have a graduate degree and five hold a post
graduate degree. The age of the subjects varies
between 22 to 35 years.
Results: The RTs with extreme values and in-
correct decisions were excluded from the data.
The data has been analyzed using two ways
ANOVA with three factors: priming (prime and
control), conditions (five classes) and prime du-
rations (three different SOA). We observe strong
priming effects (p&lt;0.05) when the target word is
morphologically derived and has a recognizable
suffix, semantically and orthographically related
with respect to the prime; no priming effects are
observed when the prime and target words are
orthographically related but share no morpholog-
ical or semantic relationship; although not statis-
tically significant (p&gt;0.07), but weak priming is
observed for prime target pairs that are only se-
mantically related. We see no significant differ-
ence between the prime and control RTs for oth-
er classes.
We also looked at the RTs for each of the 500
target words. We observe that maximum priming
occurs for words in [M+S+O+](69%), some
priming is evident in [M+S+O-](51%) and
[M&apos;+S-O+](48%), but for most of the words in
[M-S+O-](86%) and [M-S-O+](92%) no priming
effect was observed.

3.2 Frequency Distribution Models of Morpho-
logical Processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994894906666667">
From the above results we saw that not all poly-
morphemic words tend to decompose during
processing, thus we need to further investigate
the processing phenomena of Bangla derived
words. One notable means is to identify whether
the stem or suffix frequency is involved in the
processing stage of that word. For this, we apply
different frequency based models to the Bangla
polymorphemic words and try to evaluate their
performance by comparing their predicted results
with the result obtained through the priming ex-
periment.
Model-1: Base and Surface word frequency ef-
fect- It states that the probability of decomposi-
tion of a Bangla polymorphemic word depends
upon the frequency of its base word. Thus, if the
stem frequency of a polymorphemic word
crosses a given threshold value, then the word
will decomposed into its constituent morpheme.
Similar claim has been made for surface word
frequency model where decomposition depends
upon the frequency of the surface word itself.
We have evaluated both the models with the 500
words used in the priming experiments discussed
above. We have achieved an accuracy of 62%
and 49% respectively for base and surface word
frequency models.
Model-2: Combining the base and surface word
frequency- In a pursuit towards an extended
model, we combine model 1 and 2 together. We
took the log frequencies of both the base and the
derived words and plotted the best-fit regression
curve over the given dataset.
The evaluation of this model over the same set
of 500 target words returns an accuracy of 68%
which is better than the base and surface word
frequency models. However, the proposed model
still fails to predict processing of around 32% of
words. This led us to further enhance the model.
For this, we analyze the role of suffixes in mor-
phological processing.
Model-3: Degree of Affixation and Suffix Prod-
uctivity: we examine whether the regression
analysis between base and derived frequency of
Bangla words varies between suffixes and how
these variations affect morphological decomposi-
tion. With respect to this, we try to compute the
degree of affixation between the suffix and the
base word. For this, we perform regression anal-
ysis on sixteen different Bangla suffixes with
varying degree of type and token frequencies.
For each suffix, we choose 100 different derived
words. We observe that those suffixes having
high value of intercept are forming derived
words whose base frequencies are substantially
high as compared to their derived forms. Moreo-
ver we also observe that high intercept value for
a given suffix indicates higher inclination to-
wards decomposition.
Next, we try to analyze the role of suffix
type/token ratio and compare them with the
base/derived frequency ratio model. This has
been done by regression analysis between the
suffix type-token ratios with the base-surface
frequency ratio.
We further tried to observe the role of suffix
productivity in morphological processing. For
this, we computed the three components of prod-
uctivity P, P* and V as discussed in (Hay and
Plag, 2004). P is the “conditioned degree of
productivity” and is the probability that we are
encountering a word with an affix and it is
representing a new type. P* is the “hapaxed-
conditioned degree of productivity”. It expresses
the probability that when an entirely new word is
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999848857142857">
encountered it will contain the suffix. V is the
“type frequency”. Finally, we computed the
productivity of a suffix through its P, P* and V
values. We found that decomposition of Bangla
polymorphemic word is directly proportional to
the productivity of the suffix. Therefore, words
that are composed of productive suffixes (P val-
ue ranges between 0.6 and 0.9) like “-oYAlA”,
“-giri”, “-tba” and “-panA” are highly decom-
posable than low productive suffixes like “-Ani”,
“-lA”, “-k”, and “-tama”. The evaluation of the
proposed model returns an accuracy of 76%
which comes to be 8% better than the preceding
models.
Combining Model-2 and Model-3: One impor-
tant observation that can be made from the above
results is that, model-3 performs best in deter-
mining the true negative values. It also possesses
a high recall value of (85%) but having a low
precision of (50%). In other words, the model
can predict those words for which decomposition
will not take place. On the other hand, results of
Model-2 posses a high precision of 70%. Thus,
we argue that combining the above two models
can better predict the decomposition of Bangla
polymorphemic words. Hence, we combine the
two models together and finally achieved an
overall accuracy of 80% with a precision of 87%
and a recall of 78%. This surpasses the perfor-
mance of the other models discussed earlier.
However, around 22% of the test words were
wrongly classified which the model fails to justi-
fy. Thus, a more rigorous set of experiments and
data analysis are required to predict access me-
chanisms of such Bangla polymorphemic words.

3.3 Stem-Suffix Compositionality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925888888889">
Compositionality refers to the fact that meaning
of a complex expression is inferred from the
meaning of its constituents. Therefore, the cost
of retrieving a word from the secondary memory
is directly proportional to the cost of retrieving
the individual parts (i.e the stem and the suffix).
Thus, following the work of (Milin et al., 2009)
we define the compositionality of a morphologi-
cally complex word (We) as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.699185">
C(We)= 1H(We)+ 2H(e)+ 3H(W|e)+ 4H(e|W)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999391818181818">
Where, H(x) is entropy of an expression x,
H(W|e) is the conditional entropy between the
stem W and suffix e and is the proportionality
factor whose value is computed through regres-
sion analysis.
Next, we tried to compute the compositionali-
ty of the stem and suffixes in terms of relative
entropy D(W||e) and Point wise mutual informa-
tion (PMI). The relative entropy is the measure
of the distance between the probability distribu-
tion of the stem W and the suffix e. The PMI
measures the amount of information that one
random variable (the stem) contains about the
other (the suffix).
We have compared the above three techniques
with the actual reaction time data collected
through the priming and lexical decision experi-
ment. We observed that all the three information
theoretic models perform much better than the
frequency based models discussed in the earlier
section, for predicting the decomposability of
Bangla polymorphemic words. However, we
think it is still premature to claim anything con-
crete at this stage of our work. We believe much
more rigorous experiments are needed to be per-
formed in order to validate our proposed models.
Further, the present paper does not consider fac-
tors related to age of acquisition, and word fami-
liarity effects that plays important role in the
processing of morphologically complex words.
Moreover, it is also very interesting to see how
stacking of multiple suffixes in a word are
processed by the human brain.

4 Organization and Processing of Com-
pound Verbs in the Mental Lexicon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976292">
Compound verbs, as discussed above, are special
type of verb sequences consisting of two or more
verbs acting as a single verb and express a single
expression of meaning. The verb V1 is known as
pole and V2 is called as vector. For example,
“13L* 9W ” (getting up) is a compound verb
where individual words do not entirely reflects
the meaning of the whole expression. However,
not all V1+V2 combinations are CVs. For exam-
ple, expressions like, “fir :Qm ”(take and then
go) and “ f�rL� wrL �” (return back) are the ex-
amples of verb sequences where meaning of the
whole expression can be derived from the mean-
ing of the individual component and thus, these
verb sequences are not considered as CV. The
key question linguists are trying to identify for a
long time and debating a lot is whether to con-
sider CVs as a single lexical units or consider
them as two separate units. Since linguistic rules
fails to explain the process, we for the first time
tried to perform cognitive experiments to under-
stand the organization and processing of such
verb sequences in the human mind. A clear un-
derstanding about these phenomena may help us
to classify or extract actual CVs from other verb

sequences. In order to do so, presently we have
applied three different techniques to collect user
data. In the first technique, we annotated 4500
V1+V2 sequences, along with their example sen-
tences, using a group of three linguists (the ex-
pert subjects). We asked the experts to classify
the verb sequences into three classes namely,
CV, not a CV and not sure. Each linguist has
received 2000 verb pairs along with their respec-
tive example sentences. Out of this, 1500 verb
sequences are unique to each of them and rest
500 are overlapping. We measure the inter anno-
tator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss et
al., 1981) measure (x) where the agreement lies
around 0.79. Next, out of the 500 common verb
sequences that were annotated by all the three
linguists, we randomly choose 300 V1+V2 pairs
and presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers.
We ask each subjects to give a compositionality
score of each verb sequences under 1-10 point
scale, 10 being highly compositional and 1 for
noncompositional. We found an agreement of
x=0.69 among the subjects. We also observe a
continuum of compositionality score among the
verb sequences. This reflects that it is difficult to
classify Bangla verb sequences discretely into
the classes of CV and not a CV. We then, com-
pare the compositionality score with that of the
expert user’s annotation. We found a significant
correlation between the expert annotation and the
compositionality score. We observe verb se-
quences that are annotated as CVs (like, খেঠে
খিল )কঠে খি ,ওঠে পড ,have got low compositio-
nality score (average score ranges between 1-4)
on the other hand high compositional values are
in general tagged as not a cv (নিঠে য়া (come and
get), নিঠে আে (return back), তুঠল খেঠেনি (kept),
গনিঠে পিল (roll on floor)). This reflects that verb
sequences which are not CV shows high degree
of compositionality. In other words non CV
verbs can directly interpret from their constituent
verbs. This leads us to the possibility that com-
positional verb sequences requires individual
verbs to be recognized separately and thus the
time to recognize such expressions must be
greater than the non-compositional verbs which
maps to a single expression of meaning. In order
to validate such claim we perform a lexical deci-
sion experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers
with 92 different verb sequences. We followed
the same experimental procedure as discussed in
(Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words.
However, rather than derived words, the subjects
were shown a verb sequence and asked whether
they recognize them as a valid combination. The
reaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded.
Our preliminarily observation from the RT anal-
ysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb se-
quences having high compositionality value is
significantly higher than the RTs for low or non-
compositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis
that Bangla compound verbs that show less com-
positionality are stored as a hole in the mental
lexicon and thus follows the full-listing model
whereas compositional verb phrases are indivi-
dually parsed. However, we do believe that our
experiment is composed of a very small set of
data and it is premature to conclude anything
concrete based only on the current experimental
results.

the following aspects of Bangla morphologically
complex words:
The Word Familiarity Effect: Here, our aim is to
study the role of familiarity of a word during its
processing. We define the familiarity of a word
in terms of corpus frequency, Age of acquisition,
the level of language exposure of a person, and
RT of the word etc.
Role of suffix types in morphological decompo-
sition: For native Bangla speakers which mor-
phological suffixes are internalized and which
are just learnt in school, but never internalized.
We can compare the representation of Native,
Sanskrit derived and foreign suffixes in Bangla
words.
Computational models of organization and
processing of Bangla compound verbs: presently
we have performed some small set of experi-
ments to study processing of compound verbs in
the mental lexicon. In the next phase of our work
we will extend the existing experiments and also
apply some more techniques like, crowd sourc-
ing and language games to collect more relevant
RT and compositionality data. Finally, based on
the collected data we will develop computational
models that can explain the possible organiza-
tional structure and processing mechanism of
morphologically complex Bangla words in the
mental lexicon.

<abstract confidence="0.999467807692308">In this work we present psycholinguistically motivated computational models for the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Our goal is to identify whether morphologically complex words are stored as a whole or are they organized along the morphological line. For this, we have conducted a series of psycholinguistic experiments to build up hypothesis on the possible organizational structure of the mental lexicon. Next, we develop computational models based on the collected dataset. We observed that derivationally suffixed Bangla words are in general decomposed during processing and compositionality between the stem and the suffix plays an important role in the decomposition process. We observed the same phenomena for Bangla verb sequences where experiments showed noncompositional verb sequences are in general stored as a whole in the ML and low traces of compositional verbs are found in the mental lexicon.</abstract>

Most of the studies are designed to support one of the two mutually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and the morphemic model. The full-listing model claims that polymorphic words are represented as a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley, 1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand, morphemic model argues that morphologically complex words are decomposed and represented in terms of the smaller morphemic units. The affixes are stripped away from the root form, which in turn are used to access the mental lexicon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981; MacKay, 1978). Intermediate to these two paradigms is the partial decomposition model that argues that different types of morphological forms are processed separately.

See Pulvermüller (2002) for a detailed account of such phenomena. It has been argued that frequency of a word influences the speed of lexical processing and thus, can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the nature and organization of lexical representations. (Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency. Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al., 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al., 1987;Burani et al., 1984;Schreuder et al., 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole. If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts. 2.2 Represent</context>

Traditionally, priming experiments have been used to study the effects of morphology in language processing. Priming is a process that results in increase in speed or accuracy of response to a stimulus, called the target, based on the occurrence of a prior exposure of another stimulus, called the prime (Tulving et al., 1982). Here, subjects are exposed to a prime word for a short duration, and are subsequently shown a target word.

Since none of the linguistic formalism could satisfactorily explain the unique phenomena of CV formation, we here for the first time drew our attention towards psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies to model the processing of verb-verb combinations in the ML and compare these responses with that of the existing models. 3 The Proposed Approaches 3.1 The psycholinguistic experiments We apply two different priming experiments namely, the cross modal priming and masked priming experiment discussed in (Forster and Davis, 1984; Rastle et al., 2000;Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) for Bangla morphologically complex words. Here, the prime is morphologically derived form of the target presented auditorily (for cross modal priming) or visually (for masked priming). The subjects were asked to make a lexical decision whether the given target is a valid word in that language. The same target word is again probed but with a different audio or visual probe called the control word. The control shows no relationship with the target. For example, baYaska (aged) and baYasa (age) is a prime-target pair, </context>

There is a rich literature on organization and lexical access of morphologically complex words where experiments have been conducted mainly for derivational suffixed words of English, Hebrew, Italian, French, Dutch, and few other languages (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008; Frost et al., 1997; Grainger, et al., 1991; Drews and Zwitserlood, 1995).

In order to do so, presently we have applied three different techniques to collect user data. In the first technique, we annotated 4500 V1+V2 sequences, along with their example sentences, using a group of three linguists (the expert subjects). We asked the experts to classify the verb sequences into three classes namely, CV, not a CV and not sure. Each linguist has received 2000 verb pairs along with their respective example sentences. Out of this, 1500 verb sequences are unique to each of them and rest 500 are overlapping. We measure the inter annotator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss et al., 1981) measure (x) where the agreement lies around 0.79. Next, out of the 500 common verb sequences that were annotated by all the three linguists, we randomly choose 300 V1+V2 pairs and presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers. We ask each subjects to give a compositionality score of each verb sequences under 1-10 point scale, 10 being highly compositional and 1 for noncompositional. We found an agreement of x=0.69 among the subjects. We also observe a continuum of compositionality score among the verb sequences.

That is, whether lexical representations in the mental lexicon are word based or are they organized along morphological lines. For example, whether a word such as “unimaginable” is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word or do we break it up “un-” , “imagine” and “- able”, understand the meaning of each of these constituent and then recombine the units to comprehend the whole word. Such questions are typically answered by designing appropriate priming experiments (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994) or other lexical decision tasks. The reaction time of the subjects for recognizing various lexical items under appropriate conditions reveals important facts about their organization in the brain. (See Sec. 2 for models of morphological organization and access and related experiments). A clear understanding of the structure and the processing mechanism of the mental lexicon will further our knowledge of how the human brain processes language. Further, these linguistically important and interesting questions are also highly significant for computational linguistics (CL) and natural language pr</context>

As linguistic arguments have so far not led to a consensus, we here use cognitive experiments to probe the brain signatures of verb-verb combinations and propose cognitive as well as computational models regarding the possible organization and processing of Bangla CVs in the mental lexicon (ML). With respect to this, we apply the different priming and other lexical decision experiments, described in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically for derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words and compound verbs of Bangla. Our cross-modal and masked priming experiment on Bangla derivationally suffixed words shows that morphological relatedness between lexical items triggers a significant priming effect, even when the forms are phonologically/orthographically unrelated. These observations are similar to those reported for English and indicate that derivationally suffixed words in Bangla are in general accessed through decomposition of the word into its constituent morphemes. Further, based on</context>

Since none of the linguistic formalism could satisfactorily explain the unique phenomena of CV formation, we here for the first time drew our attention towards psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies to model the processing of verb-verb combinations in the ML and compare these responses with that of the existing models. 3 The Proposed Approaches 3.1 The psycholinguistic experiments We apply two different priming experiments namely, the cross modal priming and masked priming experiment discussed in (Forster and Davis, 1984; Rastle et al., 2000;Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) for Bangla morphologically complex words. Here, the prime is morphologically derived form of the target presented auditorily (for cross modal priming) or visually (for masked priming). The subjects were asked to make a lexical decision whether the given target is a valid word in that language. The same target word is again probed but with a different audio or visual probe called the control word. The control shows no relationship with the target. For example, baYaska (aged) and baYasa (age) is a prime-target pair, for which the corresponding control-target pair c</context>

Moreover, Indian languages show some distinct phenomena like, compound and composite verbs for which no such investigations have been conducted yet. On the other hand, experiments indicate that mental representation and processing of morphologically complex words are not quite language independent (Taft, 2004). Therefore, the findings from experiments in one language cannot be generalized to all languages making it important to conduct similar experimentations in other languages. This work aims to design cognitively motivated computational models that can explain the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Presently we will concentrate on the following two aspects: • Organization and processing of Bangla Polymorphemic words: our objective here is to determine whether the mental lexicon decomposes morphologically complex words into its constituent m</context>

It has been argued that frequency of a word influences the speed of lexical processing and thus, can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the nature and organization of lexical representations. (Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency. Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al., 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al., 1987;Burani et al., 1984;Schreuder et al., 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole. If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts. 2.2 Representation of Compound Verbs A compound verb (CV) consists of a sequence of two verbs (V1 a</context>

In other words non CV verbs can directly interpret from their constituent verbs. This leads us to the possibility that compositional verb sequences requires individual verbs to be recognized separately and thus the time to recognize such expressions must be greater than the non-compositional verbs which maps to a single expression of meaning. In order to validate such claim we perform a lexical decision experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers with 92 different verb sequences. We followed the same experimental procedure as discussed in (Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words. However, rather than derived words, the subjects were shown a verb sequence and asked whether they recognize them as a valid combination. The reaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded. Our preliminarily observation from the RT analysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb sequences having high compositionality value is significantly higher than the RTs for low or noncompositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis that Bangla compound verbs that show less compositionality are stored as a hole in the mental lexicon and thus follows the full-listing model</context>
