This book provides an extremely well-written introduc-
tion to legal artificial intelligence combined with a
highly original approach to problems of legal reasoning.
Although this book is a revised version of her Ph.D.
thesis, Gardner&apos;s ideas are mature and the exposition is
designed to make both legal and computational prob-
lems clear to the general reader. These ideas are em-
bodied in an automated system for solving offer and
acceptance problems in contract law.
Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the problems
of modeling legal reasoning. One major complication is
the open texture or incomplete definition of many legal
predicates. Another is that the program must be able to
distinguish between problems it can handle and those
that may well cause experts to disagree. The choice of
offer and acceptance problems in contract law as a
problem domain has the advantage that this area does
not require a great deal of legal background. Also these
problems make more use of case law than of statutes;
thus they are rule-guided but not rule-governed.
Chapter 2 goes more deeply into the place of rules in
legal reasoning. From the point of view of the expert
system designer, the law has certain advantages. Law-
yers have been known to write down explicit, if non-
computational, rules for legal reasoning, although much
of this work is controversial. Chapter 3 goes on to
discuss the problem of applying rules to the stated facts
of the case. Rules of commonsense knowledge are
necessary here as well as heuristics for understanding
cases and recognizing examples of patterns. Chapter 4
relates this research to other work in legal artificial
intelligence.
Chapter 5 attacks problems of the representation of
natural language text. The facts of a problem are
translated into a set of logical formulas in the predicate-
calculus syntax of Genesereth&apos;s MRS. The representa-
tion methodology pays particular attention to reported
speech, an important feature of contract cases. Analysis
of the predicate-calculus representation determines
whether any given speech act has the effective force of
a declaration. Then declarations are further analyzed to
see whether they are indeed legal acts.
Chapter 6 focuses on a different kind of representa-
tion problem, the problem of representing legal knowl-
edge. Knowledge of the basic legal categories and the
way elements of those categories may be ordered is
represented in an augmented transition network with
arcs labeled &amp;quot;offer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;acceptance&amp;quot;, etc. Knowledge of
the definitions of the major categories is expressed in
&amp;quot;if. . . then&amp;quot; rules. Knowledge about undefined pred-
icates is expressed in the representation system already
developed for representing text in the previous chapter.
Finally, Chapter 7 traces the operations of Dr Gardner&apos;s
system on a number of illuminating example problems,
annotated with insightful comments. Her program is
written in a combination of MRS and MacLisp and runs
on a DecSystem-20 at Stanford.
In summary, this book provides a fascinating com-
putational framework for modeling legal reasoning,
combining automated reasoning, concepts from legal
theory, and techniques for representing legal knowledge
and natural language text. For the computational lin-
guist the most interesting sections are the discussion of
speech acts and the methodology for representing re-
ported speech in Chapter 5.

Sprowl developed the legal document generation system
ABF. Her present research concerns computational uses of
on-line dictionaries, especially for text generation. Evens&apos;s
