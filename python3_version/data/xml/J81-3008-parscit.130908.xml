of Office Text. The office traditionally is the focal
point in any business organization for the receipt of
quantities of incoming documents and for the genera-
tion of comparable amounts of outgoing text. In the
future these two roles are expected to continue, but
under much more trying circumstances: the volume of
incoming and outgoing text — hardcopy or electronic
— will increase, but the availability of people to per-
form the necessary processing will decrease. Secretar-
ies will be asked to do more tasks for more people,
using more complex equipment, and may very likely
find this occupation less rewarding, leaving the office
principals to fend more and more for themselves. This
session will highlight new ways in which computers
can assist principals in the intelligent processing of
text, ranging from document abstracting to sophisticat-
ed critiquing of new material.
The session will be chaired by Lance Miller. The

Language. Office principals traditionally have had
little difficulty in expressing what they wanted done to
those who were to do it. Styles vary, but — terse or
expansive, formal or informal — the method of com-
munication was in some &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; language. As the
role of machines in the office increases, particularly
that of computers, the problem of the communication
language becomes more acute. The offhand request to
&amp;quot;Please pull the files on the Smith Account,&amp;quot; once
simply stated and forgotten until the documents ap-
peared on the desk, now must be laboriously and pre-
cisely fashioned in a quite unnatural and unfamiliar
tongue. However, it appears to be increasingly possi-
ble to overlay the formal computer-ese with more nat-
ural means of communication. This session will dis-
cuss systems and techniques for providing natural lan-
guage interfaces to office systems.
The session will be chaired by George Heidorn,
IBM Research. The participants will be:

Call for Papers - 1982 ACL Meeting

<bodyText confidence="0.992941142857143">
The 20th Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics will be held at the Universi-
ty of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from Wed-
nesday, June 16, through Friday, June 18, 1982. Pa-
pers are being solicited on linguistically and computa-
tionally significant topics, including but not limited to
the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999726">
• syntax, parsing, and language generation,
• computational semantics (including logic, refer-
ence, anaphora, and metaphor),
• discourse analysis and speech acts,
• representation of knowledge, deduction, and plan-
ning as related to language understanding or
production,
• speech analysis and synthesis,
• machine translation, machine-aided translation,
and automated dictionaries,
• mathematical and theoretical foundations of com-
putational linguistics,
• linguistic theories and their computational appli-
cations, and
• software tools for computational linguistics.

An author wishing to present a paper should submit
six copies of a 5 to 8 page summary, double-spaced,
by February 1, 1982 to: Madeleine Bates, Bolt Bera-
nek and Newman Inc., 50 Moulton Street, Cambridge,
Mass. 02138, USA [phone: (617) 497-3634; ARPA-
NET: bates@bbnd].
It is important that the summary identify the new
ideas and clearly indicate to what extent the work is
complete and to what extent it has been implemented.
It should contain sufficient information to allow the
program committee to determine the scope of the work
and its relation to relevant literature.
All submissions will be read by the program com-
mittee, which is chaired by Madeleine Bates, BBN,
and consists of Jonathan Allen, MIT, Robert Berwick,
MIT, Barbara Grosz, SRI International, Chris Ries-
beck, Yale University, and Stuart Shapiro, SUNY Buf-
falo.
Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their
papers by March 8, 1982. Full-length versions of
accepted papers submitted by April 19, 1982 will be
included in the Proceedings of the Conference.
