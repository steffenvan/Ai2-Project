State-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT)
systems are still far from being perfect. An
alternative is the so-called Interactive Ma-
chine Translation (IMT) framework, where
the knowledge of a human translator is com-
bined with the MT system. We present a sta-
tistical IMT system able to learn from user
feedback by means of the application of on-
line learning techniques. These techniques al-
low the MT system to update the parameters of
the underlying models in real time. According
to empirical results, our system outperforms
the results of conventional IMT systems. To
the best of our knowledge, this online learning
capability has never been provided by previ-
ous IMT systems. Our IMT system is imple-
mented in C++, JavaScript, and ActionScript;

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999975137254902">
The research in the field of machine translation
(MT) aims to develop computer systems which are
able to translate text or speech without human in-
tervention. However, current translation technology
has not been able to deliver full automated high-
quality translations. Typical solutions to improve the
quality of the translations supplied by an MT system
require manual post-editing. This serial process pre-
vents the MT system from integrating the knowledge
of the human translator.
An alternative way to take advantage of the exist-
ing MT technologies is to use them in collaboration
with human translators within a computer-assisted
translation (CAT) or interactive framework (Isabelle
and Church, 1997). Interactivity in CAT has been
explored for a long time. Systems have been de-
signed to interact with linguists to solve ambiguities
or update user dictionaries.
An important contribution to CAT technology was
pioneered by the TransType project (Foster et al.,
1997; Langlais et al., 2002). The idea proposed in
that work was to embed data driven MT techniques
within the interactive translation environment. Fol-
lowing the TransType ideas, Barrachina et al. (2009)
proposed the so-called IMT framework, in which
fully-fledged statistical MT (SMT) systems are used
to produce full target sentences hypotheses, or por-
tions thereof, which can be accepted or amended
by a human translator. Each corrected text segment
is then used by the MT system as additional infor-
mation to achieve improved suggestions. Figure 1
shows an example of a typical IMT session.
The vast majority of the existing work on
IMT makes use of the well-known batch learning
paradigm. In the batch learning paradigm, the train-
ing of the IMT system and the interactive transla-
tion process are carried out in separate stages. This
paradigm is not able to take advantage of the new
knowledge produced by the user of the IMT system.
In this paper, we present an application of the online
learning paradigm to the IMT framework. In the on-
line learning paradigm, the training and prediction
stages are no longer separated. This feature is par-
ticularly useful in IMT since it allows to take into ac-
count the user feedback. Specifically, our proposed
IMT system can be extended with the new training
samples that are generated each time the user vali-
dates the translation of a given source sentence. The
online learning techniques implemented in our IMT
system incrementally update the statistical models
involved in the translation process.

There are some works on IMT in the literature that
try to take advantage of user feedback. One exam-
ple is the work by Nepveu et al. (2004), where dy-
namic adaptation of an IMT system via cache-based
model extensions to language and translation models
is proposed. One major drawback of such proposal
is its inability to learn new words.

Recent research on IMT has proposed the use of
online learning as one possible way to successfully
incorporate user feedback in IMT systems (Ortiz-
Mart´ınez et al., 2010). In the online learning setting,
models are trained sample by sample. For this rea-
son, such learning paradigm is appropriate for its use
in the IMT framework. The work by Ortiz-Mart´ınez
et al. (2010) implements online learning as incre-
mental learning. Specifically, an IMT system able
to incrementally update the parameters of all of the
different models involved in the interactive transla-
tion process is proposed. One previous attempt to
implement online learning in IMT is the work by
Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2008). In that work, the authors
present a very constrained version of online learn-
ing, which is not able to extend the translation mod-
els due to the high time cost of the learning process.
We have adopted the online learning techniques
proposed in (Ortiz-Mart´ınez et al., 2010) to imple-
ment our IMT system. We are not aware of other
IMT tools that include such functionality. For in-
stance, a prototype system for text prediction to help
translators is shown in (Foster et al., 2002). Addi-
tionally, Koehn (2009) presents the Caitra transla-
tion tool. Caitra aids linguists suggesting sentence
completions, alternative words or allowing users to
post-edit machine translation output. However, nei-
ther of these systems are able to take advantage of
the user validated translations.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97430325">
IMT can be seen as an evolution of the statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) framework. In SMT, given
source string f, we seek for the target string e which
maximizes the posterior probability:

<equation confidence="0.987478">
e� = argmax Pr(elf) (1)
e
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911727272727">
Within the IMT framework, a state-of-the-art
SMT system is employed in the following way. For
a given source sentence, the SMT system automati-
cally generates an initial translation. A human trans-
lator checks this translation from left to right, cor-
recting the first error. The SMT system then pro-
poses a new extension, taking the correct prefix ep
into account. These steps are repeated until the
whole input sentence has been correctly translated.
In the resulting decision rule, we maximize over all
possible extensions es of ep:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99733">
es = argmax
es Pr(eslep,f) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999535571428571">
It is worth to note that the user interactions are at
character level, that is, for each submitted keystroke
the system provides a new extension (or suffix) to
the current hypothesis. A typical IMT session for a
given source sentence is depicted in Figure 1.
State-of-the-art SMT systems follow a log-linear
approach (Och and Ney, 2002), where the posterior

linear approach can be easily adapted for its use in
the IMT framework as follows:

Hinton, 1998). The complete details can be found in
(Ortiz-Mart´ınez et al., 2010).

where each hm(ep, es, f) is a feature function rep-
resenting a statistical model and Am its correspond-
ing weight. Typically, a set of statistical generative
models are used as feature functions. Among this
feature functions, the most relevant are the language
and translation models. The language model is im-
plemented using statistical n-gram language mod-
els and the translation model is implemented using
phrase-based models.
The IMT system proposed here is based on a log-
linear SMT system which includes a total of seven
feature functions: an n-gram language model, a tar-
get sentence length model, inverse and direct phrase-
based models, source and target phrase length mod-
els and a reordering model.

4 Online Learning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980041666667">
In the online learning paradigm, learning proceeds
as a sequence of trials. In each trial, a sample is
presented to the learning algorithm to be classified.
Once the sample is classified, its correct label is told
to the learning algorithm.
The online learning paradigm fits nicely in the
IMT framework, since the interactive translation of
the source sentences generates new user-validated
training samples that can be used to extend the sta-
tistical models involved in the translation process.
One key aspect in online learning is the time re-
quired by the learning algorithm to process the new
training samples. One way to satisfy this constraint
is to obtain incrementally updateable versions of the
algorithms that are executed to train the statistical
models involved in the translation process. We have
adopted this approach to implement our IMT sys-
tem. Specifically, our proposed IMT system imple-
ments the set of training algorithms that are required
to incrementally update each component of the log-
linear model. Such log-linear model is composed of
seven components (see section 3). One key aspect of
the required training algorithms is the necessity to
replace the conventional expectation-maximization

Prototype architecture has been built on two main
aspects, namely, accessibility and flexibility. The
former is necessary to reach a larger number of po-
tential users. The latter allows researchers to test
different techniques and interaction protocols.
For that reason, we developed an CAT Appli-
cation Programming Interface (API) between the
client and the actual translation engine, by using
a network communication protocol and exposing a
well-defined set of functions.

A diagram of the architecture is shown in Fig-
ure 2. On the one hand, the IMT client provides a
User Interface (UI) which uses the API to commu-
nicate with the IMT server through the Web. The
hardware requirements in the client are very low,
as the translation process is carried out remotely on
the server, so virtually any computer (including net-
books, tablets or 3G mobile phones) should be fairly
enough. On the other hand, the server, which is
unaware of the implementation details of the IMT
client, uses and adapts the statistical models that are
used to perform the translation.

fix is produced based on the previous validated
prefix and the interaction amendments. Using
this new prefix, the system suggests a suitable
continuation of it.

5.4 Demo Description and Usage

This demo exploits the WWW to enable the connec-
tion of simultaneous accesses across the globe, coor-
dinating client-side scripting with server-side tech-
nologies. The interface uses web technologies such
as XHTML, JavaScript, and ActionScript; while the
IMT engine is written in C++.
The prototype is publicly available on the Web
(http://cat.iti.upv.es/imt/). Tobegin
with, the UI loads an index of all available transla-
tion corpora. Currently, the prototype can be tested
with the well-known Europarl corpora (Koehn,
2005). The user chooses a corpus and navigates to
the main interface page (Figure 3), where she in-
teractively translates the text segments one by one.
User’s feedback is then processed by the IMT server.

All corrections are stored in plain text logs on the
server, so the user can retake them in any mo-

lows uploading custom documents in text format.
Since the users operate within a web browser,
the system also provides crossplatform compatibil-
ity and requires neither computational power nor
disk space on the client’s machine. The communi-
cation between application and web server is based
on asynchronous HTTP connections, providing thus
a richer interactive experience (no page refreshes are
required.) Moreover, the Web server communicates
with the IMT engine through binary TCP sockets,
ensuring really fast response times.

6 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984657142857">
Experimental results were carried out using the Xe-
rox corpus (Barrachina et al., 2009), which con-
sists of translation of Xerox printer manual involv-
ing three different language pairs: French-English,
Spanish-English, and German-English. This corpus
has been extensively used in the literature to report
IMT results. The corpus consists of approximately
50,000 sentences pairs for training, 1,000 for devel-
opment, and 1,000 for test.
The evaluation criteria used in the experiments are
the key-stroke and mouse-action ratio (KSMR) met-
ric (Barrachina et al., 2009), which measures the
user effort required to generate error-free transla-
tions, and the well-known BLEU score, which con-
stitutes a measure of the translation quality.
The test corpora were interactively translated
from English to the other three languages, compar-
ing the performance of a batch IMT (baseline) and
the online IMT systems. The batch IMT system
is a conventional IMT system which is not able to
take advantage of user feedback after each trans-
lation is performed. The online IMT system uses
the translations validated by the user to adapt the
translation models at runtime. Both systems were
initialized with a log-linear model trained in batch
mode using the training corpus. Table 1 shows the
BLEU score and the KSMR for the batch and the
online IMT systems (95% confidence intervals are
shown). The BLEU score was calculated from the
first translation hypothesis produced by the IMT sys-
tem for each source sentence. All the obtained im-
provements with the online IMT system were statis-
tically significant. The average online training time
for each new sample presented to the system, and
the average response time for each user interaction

extensions for corrected prefixes) are also shown in
Table 1, which are less than a tenth of a second and
around two tenths of a second respectively1. Ac-
cording to the reported response and online training
times, we can argue that the system proposed here is
able to be used on real time scenarios.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979375">
We have described an IMT system with online learn-
ing which is able to learn from user feedback in real
time. As far as we know, to our knowledge, this
feature have never been provided by previously pre-
sented IMT prototypes.
The proposed IMT tool is publicly available
through the Web (http://cat.iti.upv.es/
imt/). Currently, the system can be used to inter-
actively translate the well-known Europarl corpus.
We have also carried out experiments with simulated
users. According to such experiments, our IMT
system is able to outperform the results obtained
by conventional IMT systems implementing batch
learning. Future work includes researching further
on the benefits provided by our online learning tech-
niques with experiments involving real users.

In the online learning setting, models are trained sample by sample. For this reason, such learning paradigm is appropriate for its use in the IMT framework. The work by Ortiz-Mart´ınez et al. (2010) implements online learning as incremental learning. Specifically, an IMT system able to incrementally update the parameters of all of the different models involved in the interactive translation process is proposed. One previous attempt to implement online learning in IMT is the work by Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2008). In that work, the authors present a very constrained version of online learning, which is not able to extend the translation models due to the high time cost of the learning process. We have adopted the online learning techniques proposed in (Ortiz-Mart´ınez et al., 2010) to implement our IMT system. We are not aware of other IMT tools that include such functionality. For instance, a prototype system for text prediction to help translators is shown in (Foster et al., 2002). Additionally, Koehn (2009) presents the Caitra translation tool.

The online learning techniques implemented in our IMT system incrementally update the statistical models involved in the translation process. 2 Related work There are some works on IMT in the literature that try to take advantage of user feedback.
