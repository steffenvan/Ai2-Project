Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999940857142857">
A design is presented for a negotiating
agent that can construct coherent joint
plans with human or artificial agents. In
negotiation there is always a trade-off
between plan quality and dialogue
length. In dynamic conditions and with
human partners, length becomes
critical. The approach to efficient
negotiation is to use an acquaintance
model that predicts which plans will be
acceptable. The negotiation dialogue
then consists of exchanges to construct
the acquaintance model and exchanges
of plan proposals.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999216185185186">
Planning problems involve reasoning
about the effects of actions so that future
actions can be chosen to satisfy a set of input
goals. In a multi-agent system, planning is a
process that occurs simultaneously in a number
of agents, each selecting their own local plans,
and for the most part independently. However,
the agents are situated in the same environment
and interactions between individual plans occur
which must be identified and reasoned about.
Such interactions might be destructive, where
one agent&apos;s chosen action has an effect that
negates another&apos;s goal, or they might be
constructive, where one agent&apos;s action can
satisfy the other&apos;s goal. In each case the agent
must identify and reason about the plans of
other agents in the community as well as about
its own. Better still, agents can exert some
influence on one another&apos;s choices by
participating in a negotiation dialogue.
This paper considers the design of a
negotiating dialogue agent to conduct plan
negotiations in practical situations with other
artificial agents or with a human user through a
natural language interface. The multitude of
plan options, the irregularity in plan quality
over the search space, and the uncertainty in
which plans are agreeable to other agents can
make the search for an acceptable joint plan a
lengthy one. Dialogue length is of critical
importance for two reasons. First, the dialogue
partner might be a human user with bounded
reasoning resources in terms of evaluating and
discussing proposals. Second, planning must
often be done in the real world, with continually
changing goals and circumstances that must be
responded to in a timely manner. The aim is
thus to construct a negotiating agent that can
reach an acceptable proposal within as few
exchanges as possible, and with little
computational burden upon itself and other
agents in generating and evaluating proposals.
It is proposed that the negotiating agent should
incrementally construct an acquaintance model,
capturing the preferences of the other agent by
constructing the topology of the plan search
space with respect to its utility. Exchanges in
the negotiation are then of two main types, one
that maps out the plan search space by
explicitly discussing goals and preferences, and
one that involves proposal and evaluation of
plan instances.
Examples from human-human dialogue
corpora (Allen et al 1995, Kowto and Price

1992) demonstrate that acquaintance models
are used to some extent to make negotiation
dialogues as brief as possible. The types of
utterance that occur in the dialogue can be
analysed and shown to be part of either
acquaintance model construction, or actual
negotiation exchanges. The corpus data sets out
the rules of play in the dialogue, and is a
necessary input to the design of a dialogue
system that can communicate fluently and
flexibly in natural language, and in a manner
similar to human negotiators. The system offers
a model of practical negotiation in real-time
environments that is inspired by human
performance in planning problems and by ideas
about multi-agent coordination for artificial
agents.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929298245614">
Acquaintance models represent the
mental state of other agents, in terms of mental
attitudes such as beliefs and desires, and plan
related states such as actions already chosen
and committed to, capabilities of executing
actions and available resources for future
commitments. They can be constructed in part
from observation of behaviour, in part from
explicit dialogue, and in part from plan
inference drawn on these two, which
hypothesises mental states consistent with
underlying spoken and domain actions. There
are some situations in which an acquaintance
model can be formed purely from observation
of domain actions with no use of
communicative acts. For example, when two
agents individually construct a plan involving
the use of the same corridor, the potential
interaction of each blocking the other&apos;s way can
be identified through a process of observation
and plan recognition as the plan is executed.
Plan recognition is a useful strategy in
situations where communication ability is
limited or in hostile zero-sum situations, such
as interactions between opponents in a robot
soccer game where one agent&apos;s goal is the
negation of the other&apos;s. In the hostile situation,
agents hide their plans and preferences from
their opponent since being able to predict the
other&apos;s actions produces more coherent action,
and in the zero-sum situation this implies a
worse utility for the agent. In cooperative
situations the utility gain of one agent&apos;s action
towards another&apos;s goal can be greater than the
utility cost to itself, motivating profitable plan
agreements between agents. In this situation,
agents will discuss their preferences with others
so that profitable interactions can be found,
resulting in each agent adopting a plan that has
a greater utility than the plan they would have
constructed without negotiating. It is interesting
to note that even in cooperative situations,
speakers will rely on the hearer&apos;s ability to
recognise their preferences through plan
recognition, by providing just enough evidence
in their utterance to disambiguate their meaning
(Allen, Perrault, 1980) (Grice, 1975). In this
paper, negotiations between self-interested
agents are discussed â€” a type of agent that is
cooperative with others as long as it can come
to deals that produce a mutual increase in
utility. Such agents will freely discuss their
mental state so that joint plan opportunities
may be identified and plans constructed. Self -
interested agents represent common negotiation
situations such as a community of agents that
trade goods and services with one another.

3. The negotiation process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989111111111">
The negotiation process is outlined as
follows. The negotiating agent begins the
planning process with a space of joint plans, S,
from which to choose a plan, and a utility
function that ranks those plans according to the
degree to which each satisfies the agent&apos;s goals.
A joint plan is the combination of the agent&apos;s
own plan and that of its acquaintances, that is,
a set of actions each associated with the agent
that is to execute them, and a set of ordering
constraints. The object of the negotiation
process is to select the highest-ranked joint plan
possible, but within constraints of acceptability
imposed by the acquaintances. At the start of
the process, little is known about the
constraints, but through explicit sharing of
information and as proposals are exchanged
and evaluated, the agent can construct an
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993492">
88
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979615384615">
accurate map of the acceptability of its plan
space. Each agent starts the negotiation by
exploring regions in the plan space of high
utility, and then bargains its way towards
regions that are of lower utility, but are more
likely to be acceptable to the other agents. Once
an acceptable plan is found, the agents enter a
subdialog-ue in which they commit to the shared
plan. The commitment is a trusted agreement
whereby each agent agrees to carry out their
portion of the plan to the best of their ability.
At this point each of the agents may execute
their portion of the complete plan.

4. Complexity and resource bounds in
negotiation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988868852459">
Constructing plans can be a time-
consuming process due to the combinatorial
complexity of the plan search space. In some
cases, it is an intractable problem, and the
combinatorial increase in generating a multi-
agent plan can aggravate this situation. The
result of the planning process can be a
correspondingly large selection of plan
proposals, of uncertain utility, which are the
objects in the negotiation. It might be argued
that the agent should reduce the complexity by
decomposing the problem and negotiating only
about parts of the plan at time. This is the
approach taken with the contract net (Smith,
Davis, 1983). In general though, actions within
plans interact by satisfying one other&apos;s
preconditions and by consuming the same
resources. These interactions prevent the
negotiating agent from dividing the plan into a
set of n independent subplans that can be
individually negotiated. With such a large space
of plan proposals to consider, a blind search for
agreeable plans may be necessary to guarantee
optimality, but could be very expensive in terms
of the time required for each proposal to be
spoken, understood and evaluated, especially
for a human user with bounded reasoning
resources. Instead the negotiating agent should
take great care in predicting which proposals
yield a high utility for the other agent.
Another difficulty that occurs in multi-
agent planning is that the actions may be too
complex to model accurately, or may be
uncertain in their effects. Unpredictable events
can happen in the environment, including the
actions of other agents who plan their actions
dynamically. One agent&apos;s model of another is
inherently incomplete and agents who appear at
one moment to be agreeable towards a plan
may change their desires unexpectedly. For
example, consider where one agent plans to use
a resource belonging to another agent. If
another agent becomes interested in the same
resource, the owner&apos;s utility value in leasing the
resource decreases to correspond with increased
demand. The negotiation model must
accommodate such uncertainties by interleaving
negotiation with plan execution. Agents must
participate in a continuous dialogue where
opportunities continually arise as circumstances
change, and commitments to plans must be
revoked and renegotiated when it becomes
apparent that plans are no longer profitable. An
example of such a dynamic situation is a robot
soccer game. Players may negotiate general
strategies which can be fixed before the game
begins, but must also adapt and make short-
term tactical decisions as the game progresses.
In dynamic situations agents must keep their
negotiations as short as possible so that they
can act before their plan becomes inapplicable.

5. Constructing and using an
acquaintance model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968538461538">
To produce acceptable joint plans
within a reasonably short dialogue, an
acquaintance model is constructed during the
dialogue that can be used to estimate the utility
value of plan proposals to the other agents.
Candidate proposals can then be found without
engaging in the expensive communicative
process of making a proposal and asking the
other agent to evaluate it. Instead, the
acquaintance model is used as a utility
approximating function that can filter those
proposals that are more likely to be accepted by
the acquaintance.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998998">
89
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99289523255814">
The acquaintance model is a tuple
&lt;C, B, D, P, PS, U: PS â€”&gt; R&gt; where:
C is the agent&apos;s capabilities, a combination of
the set of actions the acquaintance is capable of
executing, the resource requirements of those
actions, and the amount of each resource
available to the agent
B is the set of acquaintance beliefs
D is the set of acquaintance desires
P is the partial plan (if any) that the
acquaintance has already committed to
executing. Further negotiation must
accommodate P.
PS is the plan space, the set of joint plans that
can satisfy D. Each joint plan is a partially
ordered set of actions to be executed by the
agent and the acquaintance.
U is the utility estimate, a function that maps
plans onto the real numbers, which ranks the
plans within the plan space according to the
acquaintance&apos;s utility
In addition there is a function F: PS â€”&gt; R which
evaluates a plan with respect to the agent&apos;s own
utility
Goal description phase
Using an acquaintance model, the
dialogue is composed of two major phases of
interaction. The first, the called goal
description phase is where the agent and the
acquaintances try to characterise one another&apos;s
utility function, capabilities, plans, desires and
beliefs. Such subdialogues can be initiated
either by the agent or the acquaintance, and
generally occur at the start of the dialogue. Two
subtypes of such interactions can be identified.
First, the agents exchange desire and belief
descriptions, which describe the world states
the agent would like to achieve, and the
perceived state of the world at the current point
in time. Desire and belief descriptions defme the
space of plans PS. For example, if one agent
states &amp;quot;I need to make some travel
arrangements&amp;quot;, PS can be defmed as a space of
plans to buy travel tickets. The acquaintance
may also have constructed and committed to
executing certain actions, P, which must be
included in all of the plans in PS. Where these
are commitments made with another agent,
revoking might be an especially expensive
process, and these actions are considered non-
negotiable. For example, the agent may state &amp;quot;I
need to book a train that will connect with the
flight I booked with agent J&amp;quot;.
Within the space of potential plans,
some plans are considered better than others by
the acquaintance, and so the second interaction
subtype serves to construct the U, the utility
estimate function. These interactions can
describe hard constraints such as &amp;quot;I must travel
first class&amp;quot;, or more fuzzy ones such as &amp;quot;I
prefer to fly early in the morning&amp;quot;. Even naive
dialogue system users are familiar with the goal
description process, and know how to provide a
description that is just succinct and detailed
enough that the system should be able to
provide a suitable proposal. In the SRI
transcripts (Kowto, Price 1992), for example,
the user will often take the initiative in the
dialogue by specifying the constraints that most
distinguish the kind of plan they would be
interested in, such as which airports they wish
to fly between and which dates they wish to fly
on. Often though the user will neglect to
mention some features, such as for example
whether an aisle or window seat is required,
either through forgetfulness or by assuming
such a feature could not be adjusted within the
plan. The system must accommodate such
behaviour by taking the initiative and asking the
user to characterise his utility with respect to
the remaining plan features. This is especially
important where the feature values have a
significant effect on the system&apos;s plan utility.
An important phenomenon occurs in
the goal description phase, which is a result of
the acquaintance trying to be as brief as
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995508">
90
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999778">
possible. This is that the acquaintance tends not
to explicitly state desires, plans and
preferences. Instead, the acquaintance expects
the agent to infer and adopt the most likely set
of mental attitudes that are consistent with his
utterance, unless otherwise stated. For example,
by stating &amp;quot;I want to book a holiday in Spain&amp;quot;,
the speaker expects the hearer to recognise the
most common plans and desires, such as the
speaker travelling to Spain, visiting the beach,
and staying for a week or two. To make these
inferences, a domain-specific plan library can
be used, associating desires with plans, to
indicate the most likely plans to realise a desire,
and the most likely desires given a plan or plan
fragment.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.864392">
Negotiation phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996380952381">
At some point in the dialogue, one of
the agents deems that the goal description
process has gathered enough information to
begin proposing specific plans that have a
reasonable likelihood of being accepted by the
other. This is where the negotiation phase of
the dialogue begins. To determine when this
point is reached, the agent uses its knowledge of
how detailed its acquaintance model has
become in the goal description process, and its
knowledge of how detailed the other agent&apos;s
acquaintance model has become. The
negotiation phase begins with the proposal of a
particular plan which is communicated to the
acquaintances. To come up with a plan, the
agent invokes its planner on the combination of
its own goals and the acquaintance model. The
search is guided by the agent&apos;s own utility
function, F, and by the utility estimate for the
acquaintance, U. The plan is chosen from
among those that yield a positive utility gain for
both the agent and the acquaintance. The
acquaintance then evaluates the plan with
respect to its utility function. At this point the
acquaintance may accept the plan at which
point the dialogue finishes. Alternatively, the
plan may be rejected. The acquaintance may
explain why the plan was not accepted,
allowing an update to U and a further iteration
of the negotiation phase, or it may declare that
its utility gain is not sufficient to warrant an
agreement, or it may update its own
acquaintance model with the evidence that the
agent has a preference towards its proposal,
and then produce a counterproposal plan. The
negotiation phase can be thought of as a
generate-and-test hill-climbing search, where
the evaluation of each proposal contributes to
the utility estimate U, and each agent searches
for proposals that have a high value for F and
U and are similar to proposals presented earlier
in the negotiation.

Commitment and revoking phases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999695">
During the agent&apos;s lifecycle,
negotiations may occur a number of times.
With new opportunities and unexpected
changes in the environment, agents
continuously make new commitments and may
revoke existing ones. Part of the dialogue
structure represents where an agent identifies
that a commitment is no longer appropriate, and
attempts to revoke it. An abstract dialogue
grammar for negotiating agents is as follows:

5. An Example
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999616">
An excerpt from the SRI transcripts
(Kowto, Price 1992) illustrates the goal
description and negotiation processes in a
human-human dialogue. A fragment of the
dialogue can be paraphrased as:
A: I believe there&apos;s an eight o&apos;clock United
flight on May 12th7
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997308">
91
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998396565217391">
B: The fare is one hundred and ninety-eight
dollars
A: What happened to the seventy-eight dollar
fare?
B: For those fares you need to stay over a
Saturday night
At the start of the dialogue A has a
plan space and approximate utility function for
B based on an earlier plan proposal, and
reasons that a similar proposal will have a
similar utility with respect to B. He therefore
deems that entering a negotiation phase is
appropriate, and suggests this new proposal
expecting that it will be acceptable to B.
However the proposal is rejected when B&apos;s
utility is found to be less than expected. A goal
description subdialogue updates A&apos;s
acquaintance model to account for plans that
involve a Saturday night stopover. At this
point, the negotiation could have continued if
there were alternative proposals, but no
alternative is presented by B, so A accepts and
a deal is reached.

6. System Design
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999571740740741">
The design of the negotiation system is
based on the family of BDI agent architectures,
of which the Grate (Jennings, 1993) and IRMA
(Bratman et al, 1988) are examples. These
architectures have been designed to work in
dynamic environments, under conditions of
bounded rationality, where plans must be
quickly and continually updated in response to
environmental changes. BDI architectures are
centred around a combination of a belief set, B,
which is what the agent holds to be true about
its environment, a set of desires D, which are
the goals or preferences of the agent, and a set
of intentions, I, which is the goals and plans
that the agent has committed to executing. The
agent executes a control loop where first the
beliefs are updated from sensor data. Then the
agent&apos;s intentions are updated by selecting a
consistent subset of the available desires, and a
plan is formed to realise those intentions.
Finally, actions that must be executed at the
current cycle are carried out, and the agent
returns to the top of the loop. Where possible,
and particularly where plans interact with those
of other agents, the BDI agent maintains a level
of commitment towards its selected plan. Figure
1 outlines the architecture of the system.

The planning component of the
traditional BDI architecture is coupled with the
negotiation manager, which is responsible for
controlling the negotiation dialogue. During the
goal description phase, the negotiation manager
updates the acquaintance model with the
beliefs, capabilities, desires and partial plan
expressed by the acquaintance. The utility
function, U, is implemented as a combination of
heuristic constraint rules derived from the goal
description phase of the dialogue, and specific
evaluated proposals expressed in the
negotiation phase. These are used to form a
case-base of high quality plans from which new
proposals can be adapted. The negotiation
manager repeats a negotiation loop, where it
calls the planner to produce a new proposal, the
proposal is communicated to the acquaintance
and a response received. The planner takes as
its input both the acquaintance model and its
own desires, and produces a plan that satisfies
both. As the negotiation proceeds, the planner
balances its utility in favour of the
acquaintance, so that an acceptable plan is
reached quickly. Once the negotiation is
finished, the agent&apos;s commitment set is updated
and commitments scheduled for the current
time-point are executed.

7. Evaluation and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993015873016">
In evaluating a plan negotiation system,
the two factors of plan quality and dialogue
length must be measured. There is a trade-off
between these, and so a weighted sum of the
two provides one suitable quantitative metric.
In addition, the system should perform well
with naive users, communicating fluently in
natural language rather than presenting and
interpreting the dialogue in an artificial
language. So far, the natural language
capability has been put aside so that the core
problem of controlling the dialogue can be
developed. Indeed it is possible to implement
and evaluate dialogue strategies without using a
natural language interface, so the short-term
plan is to do just that, while in the long term,
the issues of generating and understanding the
types of utterances that occur in negotiation
dialogues will be dealt with. With a complete
dialogue control system and natural language
interface, human-human dialogues can be
compared with human-system dialogues in the
same experimental setting.
With the objective of producing a
system that behaves like a human-being would,
and bearing in mind that human-beings can be
accomplished negotiators, further corpus
analysis will help to highlight how dialogue
control should be approached. Dialogue
structure can be analysed to identify the phases
of negotiation and their content. Corpora
already exist in for example the SRI transcripts
in the ATIS project (Kowto, Price 1992), which
concern dialogues with a travel agent, the
TRAINS project (Allen, 1995), which concern
dialogues between a human manager and a
planning assistant in a planning task, and in the
Verbmobil corpus, which concerns negotiations
about meeting scheduling. While such corpora
are useful, other experiments may be carried
out to investigate how humans cope with
negotiation and planning, particularly under
pressing time constraints. A suitable task might
be a simulated soccer game, a blocks-world
task, the Tileworld ( Pollack, Ringuette 1990),
or the postman problem ( Zlotkin, Rosenschein,
1989)
The idea of that acquaintances can be grouped
into stereotypes classes with similar properties
is important in a negotiation system, as a means
of reducing the length of the goal description
phase. For example, by contacting a travel
agent, an agent can bring to mind stereotypical
properties constructed from past experience
with travel agents, such as their capabilities,
and typical utility values associated with their
plans. Such information can be used to initially
construct the user model, which can then be
further refined in the dialogue. On the travel
agent&apos;s side, asking whether the customer is a
businessman or a student for example can
influence the acquaintance model. An extra
dialogue phase of stereotype activation might

<bodyText confidence="0.999937">
be added to the dialogue structure, and
evaluated to see if it can produce better plans in
the same dialogue length.

<abstract confidence="0.9996102">A design is presented for a negotiating agent that can construct coherent joint plans with human or artificial agents. In negotiation there is always a trade-off between plan quality and dialogue length. In dynamic conditions and with human partners, length becomes critical. The approach to efficient negotiation is to use an acquaintance model that predicts which plans will be acceptable. The negotiation dialogue then consists of exchanges to construct the acquaintance model and exchanges of plan proposals.</abstract>

With the objective of producing a system that behaves like a human-being would, and bearing in mind that human-beings can be accomplished negotiators, further corpus analysis will help to highlight how dialogue control should be approached. Dialogue structure can be analysed to identify the phases of negotiation and their content. Corpora already exist in for example the SRI transcripts in the ATIS project (Kowto, Price 1992), which concern dialogues with a travel agent, the TRAINS project (Allen, 1995), which concern dialogues between a human manager and a planning assistant in a planning task, and in the Verbmobil corpus, which concerns negotiations about meeting scheduling. While such corpora are useful, other experiments may be carried out to investigate how humans cope with negotiation and planning, particularly under pressing time constraints. A suitable task might be a simulated soccer game, a blocks-world task, the Tileworld ( Pollack, Ringuette 1990), or the postman problem ( Zlotkin, Rosenschein, 1989) The idea of that acquaintances can be grouped into stereotypes classes with simi</context>

However the proposal is rejected when B&apos;s utility is found to be less than expected. A goal description subdialogue updates A&apos;s acquaintance model to account for plans that involve a Saturday night stopover. At this point, the negotiation could have continued if there were alternative proposals, but no alternative is presented by B, so A accepts and a deal is reached. 6. System Design The design of the negotiation system is based on the family of BDI agent architectures, of which the Grate (Jennings, 1993) and IRMA (Bratman et al, 1988) are examples. These architectures have been designed to work in dynamic environments, under conditions of bounded rationality, where plans must be quickly and continually updated in response to environmental changes. BDI architectures are centred around a combination of a belief set, B, which is what the agent holds to be true about its environment, a set of desires D, which are the goals or preferences of the agent, and a set of intentions, I, which is the goals and plans that the agent has committed to executing. The agent executes a control loop where first the beliefs are updated from sen</context>

In this situation, agents will discuss their preferences with others so that profitable interactions can be found, resulting in each agent adopting a plan that has a greater utility than the plan they would have constructed without negotiating. It is interesting to note that even in cooperative situations, speakers will rely on the hearer&apos;s ability to recognise their preferences through plan recognition, by providing just enough evidence in their utterance to disambiguate their meaning (Allen, Perrault, 1980) (Grice, 1975). In this paper, negotiations between self-interested agents are discussed â€” a type of agent that is cooperative with others as long as it can come to deals that produce a mutual increase in utility. Such agents will freely discuss their mental state so that joint plan opportunities may be identified and plans constructed. Self - interested agents represent common negotiation situations such as a community of agents that trade goods and services with one another. 3.
