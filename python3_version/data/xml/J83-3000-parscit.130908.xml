Change in journal name. With the first issue of Volume 10, which will be at the
printers by the time you receive this issue, the journal name will be changed to
COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS to reflect better its international nature. In the next
few years we look forward to the increased participation and representation of the
global computational linguistics community in ACL affairs.
Special issues. This is the first in a series of special issues that will appear in the
journal of the Association for Computational Linguistics in the upcoming years. Each
special issue will deal with an important issue in depth, and will attempt to present a
representative survey of all approaches to the problem. This issue was produced by
actively soliciting papers from the researchers we knew to be working in the area, and
by a call for papers published in various Al newsletters to notify those we inadvertent-
ly overlooked. All papers were reviewed through the regular journal reviewing process
and the normal acceptance standards were applied. This will be the procedure for
future issues as well.
In general, there will be a guest editor for each special issue. This issue, being the
first, was edited by me in order that I might lay the groundwork for future issues. The
next special issue, under the guest editorship of Ray Perrault at SRI, will appear in
Volume 10 and will concern the complexity of grammatical formalisms. Any sugges-
tions for further special issues would be appreciated and should be sent to me.
About this issue. One of the crucial problems facing natural language systems is the
handling of ill-formed input. While significant progress has been made in the process-
ing of correct text, a practical system must be able to handle many form of ill-
f ormedness gracefully. This includes lexical problems such as misspelled words,
sentential problems such as missing words or phrases and bad word order, semantic
problems such as anomalous or self contradictory sentences, and contextual problems
such as incoherent requests or continuations. Of course, often when a problem arises,
it appears in many of the above classes simultaneously, since a problem at one level
can easily cause a problem at another. This issue contains papers that address ill-
formedness at a particular level, such as in syntactic structure, as well as papers that
address ill-formedness across many levels.
continued overleaf
Two of these papers offer surveys of the approaches to ill-formedness, namely the
Carbonell and Hayes paper and the Weischedel and Sondheimer paper. These give the
reader an idea of the range of problems to be tackled and a rough breakdown of the
various approaches. The Carbonell and Hayes paper offers the most comprehensive
survey and describes approaches usable in semantically restricted domains.
The Jensen et al. and the Weischedel and Sondheimer papers deal mainly with
ill-formedness at the syntactic level. Both suggest methods of relaxing the syntactic
constraints imposed by the grammar in the face of ill-formedness. Jensen et al.
propose a framework that produces an approximate parse using the grammatical rules
for correct sentences, while Weischedel and Sondheimer propose a system of meta-
rules that are used to diagnose problems and relax certain parsing constraints in order
to produce an analysis.
The two remaining papers deal more with semantic and contextual ill-formedness.
Fass and Wilks propose methods for choosing the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; semantic interpretation in the
presence of apparent semantic ill-formedness and relate that work to the problem of
understanding metaphors. Granger proposes a range of techniques, emphasizing the
use of semantic and contextual methods for dealing with ill-formed text in domains
that have well defined contextual constraints.
Taken together, these five papers offer a comprehensive view of the state of the art
in dealing with ill-formed input, a problem that is of increasing importance as practical
systems are developed.
