Background and Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913347826087">
Thanks to both statistical approaches and finite state methods, natural language pro-
cessing (NLP), particularly in the area of robust, open-domain text processing, has
made considerable progress in the last couple of decades. It is probably fair to say that
NLP tools have reached satisfactory performance at the level of syntactic processing,
be the output structures chunks, phrase structures, or dependency graphs. Therefore,
the time seems ripe to extend the state-of-the-art and consider deep semantic process-
ing as a serious task in wide-coverage NLP.
This is a step that normally requires syntactic parsing, as well as integrating named
entity recognition, anaphora resolution, thematic role labelling and word sense disam-
biguation, and other lower levels of processing for which reasonably good methods
have already been developed.
The goal of the STEP workshop is to provide a forum for anyone active in semantic
processing of text to discuss innovative technologies, representation issues, inference
techniques, prototype implementations, and real applications. The preferred process-
ing targets are large quantities of texts — either specialised domains, or open domains
such as newswire text, blogs, and wikipedia-like text. Implemented rather than theo-
retical work is emphasised in STEP.
Featuring in STEP 2008 workshop is a “shared task” on comparing semantic repre-
sentations as output by state-of-the-art NLP systems. Participants were asked to sup-
ply a (small) text, before the workshop. The test data for the shared task is composed
out of all the texts submitted by the participants, allowing participants to “challenge”
each other. The output of these systems will be judged on a number of aspects by a
panel of experts in the field, during the workshop.

STEP 2008 is organised as a three-day event at Ca’ Dolfin, at the Università Ca’
Foscari in Venice, Italy, taking place on September 22–24. In reply to our call for
papers we received 40 submissions: 24 regular papers, 8 short papers, and 8 shared
task papers. We accepted 30 of these: 18 regular papers, 5 short papers, and 7 shared
task papers (yielding an overall acceptance rate of 75%). We would like to thank the
referees and members of the programme committee for helping us to review and select
the papers:
