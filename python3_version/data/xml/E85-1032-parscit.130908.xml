<bodyText confidence="0.9992261">
The present study examines the semantic problems
involved in computing the meaning of the non standard
uses of if. The central question is whether or not it is
necessary to introduce different meanings of if.
Austin proposed two non standard meanings for if. We
show that these can be accounted for by the standard
meaning together with shifts in the position of the speech
act within the sentence. These uses of if are among the 9
different non standard uses which we found in a sample of
if sentences taken from the Brown University corpus:

&amp;quot;If you want to see -&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Never mind&amp;quot;, she said
sternly.
Each use was examined to see whether it could be
accounted for by the standard meaning of if, together
with other features of the sentence. Similar differences
in usage should then be found with other SCs. This was
the case for the first four uses. In three uses (6,7,8) if
may/must occur in a phrase rather than in a full clause.
The hypothesis that these uses can be derived from the
standard meaning of if in an equivalent clause was
explored and rejected. Two of these uses (6,7) require a
material implication interpretation of if, also necessary
for a few of the standard conditional sentences.
Two uses (5,9) require only that the truth value of the
following clause/phrase is unspecified. This is a property
that all the uses have in common (with the exception of
the factual use where the truth of the protasis is used to
emphasise the truth of the apodosis) and is thus the
feature that relates the different meanings of if. The
standard use and the non standard uses using the standard
meaning (1,2,3,4) require, in addition, that there is an
inference relation from the protasis (the if sub clause) to
the apodosis (the main clause in which the if clause is
embedded).
So we propose that three different meanings of if are
required: inference (including the standard use), material
implication (uses 6,7) and just doubting the truth value of
the following proposition (uses 5,9). Each of these three
uses may be expected to be translated by different words
in other languages, e.g. in Dutch by als, zo and of (except
for use 8) respectively.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978666172413793">
There has long been, and still is, a controversy about
the meaning of if (e.g. Grice, 1967; Stalnaker, 1975;
Harper et al, 1981). Much of this discussion presupposes
that there is indeed one meaning of if. Is this
presupposition justified?
At one level the answer is clearly &apos;no&apos;, e.g. if can be
used to introduce a noun clause following an illocutionary
verb:
John asked if he could come in now.
Such examples do not conform to the conditional use of if
as in:
If John asked he could come in now.
This is so different a use of if that one might claim it
should be set aside from the .conditional if. Thus there
would be two ifs: if&apos; for subordinate clauses and if&amp;quot; for
noun clauses.
Our question should be reformulated as: is there only
one meaning of if&apos;? Austin (1961) claimed that the answer
was &apos;no&apos;, providing examples that did not conform to two
logical properties that are associated with if&apos;. There is a
stipulative use of if&apos; which does not contrapose, e.g. from
I. I promise to marry him if he asks me.
one does not conclude that
If I do not promise to marry him, he does not ask
me.
There is also an if of doubt or hesitation which not only
fails to contrapose, but which also asserts the proposition
underlying the main clause (the &apos;apodosis proposition&apos;),
e.g. from
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.260359" genericHeader="method">
2. There are biscuits on the table if you want some.

fails to contrapose, but also we are willing to accept the
apodosis simpliciter. Can this claim be rebutted?
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996647875">
We believe that it can be. Austin&apos;s fault lies in
working with the surface structure rather than with the
underlying propositions. He thus fails to take account of
the scope of if and of the scope of the speech act
involved. With conditional if&apos;, the condition falls within
the scope of the speech act. When there is a performative
verb in the apodosis, then the conditional is within the
scope of the performative; so the performative itself is
not within the conditional, just as with Austin&apos;s example
of stipulative if&apos;. Thus 1 is paraphrasable as:
I promise that I will marry him if he asks me.
in which the promise is contraposable:
I promise that he does not ask me if I will not marry
him.
In the case of an if of doubt or hesitation it is the speech
act that falls within the scope of the conditional. Thus 2
is:
If you want biscuits, accept the declaration that
there are some on the table.
This act of speech is to be noticed only when the
proposition underlying the protasis (the if clause) holds; it
is NOT made simpliciter.
This explanation of the reading of Austin&apos;s two ifs,
based on the relative scopes of the speech act and if, can
be extended to other subordinating conjunctions (SC&apos;s),
e.g.
promise to marry him unless/provided/when he&apos;s
rich.
The case for the non-restrictive use, with the speech act
falling within the scope of the SC was made by
Rutherford (1970), e.g.
He&apos;ll marry you, unless I&apos;m mistaken.
In view of this generality it is parsimonious to regard
Austin&apos;s two ifs as two different uses arising out of the
context of the speech act, rather than as two different
meanings of if.
Rejecting Austin&apos;s ifs as possible contenders for an if&apos;
having a non standard meaning does not, however, show
that there are no non standard meanings.
In fact the 0.E.D suggests 9 different uses of if:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9590829">
I. conditional;
2. semi-factual;
3. counterfactual;
4. a pregnant sense, e.g.
If they are poor, they are at any rate happy;
5. an archaic use with that;
6. an elliptic use, e.g. if at all;
7. the protasis alone, e.g. If I had only known;
8. in phrases, e.g. as if;
9. introducing a noun clause, e.g. ask if.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97036408">
(Note that this list does NOT include Austin&apos;s two uses of
if!)
To check whether or not there were further possible
uses we have taken a 10% sample of if sentences from
the Brown University corpus of American printed texts,
available on magnetic tape (Kucera &amp; Francis, 1967). In
our judgement in 61% of the 218 sentences in the sample,
if was used in a standard conditional way. In 8% the if
was preceded by some modifier, e.g. as if. This left 69
(31%) non standard uses of if as possible contenders for
different meanings of if.
A TAXONOMY OF NON STANDARD IF
To consider the possibility that some meanings of if
differ from the conditional, we need some way of
classifying the 69 non standard sentences in our sample.
The taxonomy we chose is based on two features that are
present in the conditional uses of if: if enables a
proposition to be referred to or entertained without being
asserted as being (possibly) true or false, and if signals an
inference relation from the protasis proposition to the
apodosis proposition.. By an inference relation we mean
that the apodosis proposition may be inferred from the
protasis proposition, together with the context
propositions. (See the critique of Bree (1973) on Wason
and Johnson-Laird&apos;s (1972) proposal for the different
interpretations of if.)
In the non standard uses of if one or the other of these
two features is either absent or altered. Thus we propose
that there are two major categories of non standard if:
A. in which the inference relation is present but the
protasis proposition is NOT in doubt, being either true
or false;
B. in which the truth status of the protasis proposition is
in doubt, but the inference relation does not run from
the protasis to the apodosis proposition.
This last class is divided into two subclasses:
Bl. in which the inference relation is present but with a
different scope from the standard use;
B2. in which the inference relation is absent.
The complete classification of the sample of if sentences
according to their different uses is shown in Table I.
We will now consider each of the different uses in
turn, in order to determine whether the use requires a
different meaning of if from the standard conditional. We
will check whether or not the non standard use is to be
found with other SCs, so that it can be accounted for
without postulating a new meaning; whether it is related
to another non standard use, so that both uses are based
on the same non standard meaning; or whether it requires
its own idiosyncratic non standard meaning of if.

Counterfactuals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988879055555555">
Counterfactual if, which is a problem for logicians, is
straightforward from our point of view. An inference
relation from the protasis proposition to that in the
apodosis is being asserted, while it is known that the
protasis proposition is false (Bree, 1982).
It is usual (16 of the 18 counterfactual sentences in
our sample) for the apodosis proposition to be false (or a
question), which is indicated by using the auxilary would:
(26) If Elaine&apos;s uncle had stuck to this desire for
aloneness, he probably would still be alive.
(60) &amp;quot;Laura, what would you say if I smoked a pipe?&amp;quot;
However the apodosis proposition may be true (1/18):
(76) (...) if it had never printed a word of literature
its contribution to the politico-sociological area
would still be historic.
The protasis alone is used to indicate that important
(desirable) consequences would flow from the truth of the
protasis:

The counterfactual construction is not unique to if; it
occurs with other SCs in which the truth status of the
subordinate clause proposition is normally open, e.g.:
She wouldn&apos;t have married him unless she had loved
him.
She would have married him provided he had asked
her.
In both cases the main proposition is false; the
subordinate proposition is true for unless and false for
provided. Thus the counterfactual use should NOT be
based on a different meaning of if, but rather in the use
of the subjunctive mode.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.646192">
Factuals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948564736842105">
The protasis proposition may be true rather than
false; this is the O.E.D. pregnant sense of if. In such
cases the apodosis proposition is also true. Moreover
there is no DIRECT relation from the protasis proposition
to the apodosis proposition, so it is strange that if is
being used at all. One possible explanation is that it is a
slip for the more appropriate SC although, as in:
(113) If Robinson was a liar and a slanderer, he was
also a very canny gentleman (...)
Sometimes it is used where cordination would be more
suitable:
(174) If we thus spent our very first day in (...) our
last day to us at least, was equally impressive
(-)
But neither sense would be appropriate in
(185) If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them
out of the Egypt of sexual slavery, Dylan
Thomas is the poet who offers them the
Dionysian dialectic of justification for their
indulgence in liquor, (...)
A more satisfactory explanation is that it is the speech
act that is conditional upon the protasis proposition. The
writer is emphasising the speech act by prefacing it (the
protasis must always occur before the apodosis in these
factuals) with a proposition that he knows the reader will
know to be true. The inference is from the protasis
proposition to the speech act containing the apodosis, as
in:
(178) (...) whether there is such fitness or not, we will
assume that there is, and if we do, we express
(...)
It is used with effect in emphasising an imperative:
(211) (...) so if you want to avoid nicked fingers, keep
your hands well out of the way.
When a writer wishes to draw attention to a speech
act, he can do so by making it conditional on a
proposition that both he and the reader know to be true.
While this constuction does not occur with other SCs, it is
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.974833">

<bodyText confidence="0.988185">
clearly a different PRAGMATIC use of if, which does not
require a different meaning of if.

Conditional speech acts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.917067739130435">
We turn now to non standard uses in which the
protasis proposition is indeed in doubt, but the inference
relation is non standard. We showed that Austin&apos;s if of
doubt or hesitation can be considered as a conditional
speech act rather than as a speech act in which there is a
conditional. Conditional speech acts are made when the
writer does not know whether or not a speech act is
appropriate in the circumstances, but he believes that the
reader does know. Most (4/6) of our examples are of this
form:
(189) If you would feel happier with full collision
insurance, there is a small additional charge (...)
(209) &amp;quot;You may come back to Strasbourg, now, if you
wish.&amp;quot;
The other use in the sample (2/6) is when the writer
wishes to pose a question but only under the appropriate
circumstances:
(190) If you use company transportation to meet
trains or haul visitors, would taxis be cheaper?
As has already been pointed out, the speech act can
fall within the scope of other SCs. Thus it is not
parsimonious to postulate a seperate meaning of if for
conditional speech acts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.901644">
Performative conditionals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996311769230769">
The scope of the speech act normally includes the
inference relation. We have just seen how the speech act
may instead occur within this relation. With performative
verbs in the apodosis we see a shift the other way; the
speech act indicated by a verb in the apodosis is NOT
within the scope of the inference relation, despite the
fact that the verb occurs in the apodosis. This is the case
with Austin&apos;s stipulative if, e.g.:
(28) (...) he vowed vengence on Viola Lake if ever
the chance came his way.
We have seen that this use also occurs with other SCs, so
the use of if within the scope of a performative does NOT
require a seperate meaning of if.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.898077">
Doubtful noun clauses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.924908380952381">
We have just looked at two uses of if in which the
protasis proposition is indeed in doubt, but in which the
inference relation is non standard. We turn now to uses in
which the inference relation is absent. The first of these
is the use of if to introduce a clause to function as the
object of a mental act:
(144) I asked an old guy (...) if the boat was Moore&apos;s.
A range of verbs involving questions take this
construction:
wonder if, when the agent has the question in his mind;
see if, when the agent tries directly to answer his
question;
ask if, when the agent puts his question to a third party;
know if, when the agent has the answer to a question in
the mind of the speaker;
doubt if, when the agent believes that the answer to a
question in the mind of the speaker is probably negative.
This construction is not found with other SCs, except for
whether; nor is there any question of it being subsumed
under any of the other uses of if. So it is an apart
meaning of if.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.982479">
Doubtful presuppositions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981725">
A frequent non standard use is to cast doubt on a
presupposition of the main clause. Just as with the use of
if to introduce a noun clause, the protasis proposition is
in doubt - more, it is being put into doubt - and there is
no inference relationship from the protasis to the
apodosis proposition. The presuppositions that were
denied in this way in the sample were:
-existence, presupposed by a noun (4/17):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8589121">
(77) But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy,
if it was the enemy (...)
-an event, presupposed by the use of a verb (3/17):
(159) Perfect, complete entities, if they move at all,
do not move towards what they lack.
-number and place, presupposed by certain adjectives or
adverbs, which are put into doubt using if any(where)
(5/17):
(10) Few areas, if any, (...)
(16) For here, if anywhere, (...)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.91692964516129">
-and possibility or necessity, presupposed by imperatives
and promises or threats (2/17):
(110) Begin the examination of a site with a good map
and aerial photos, if possible.
(100) The posse then asked that he send out the
women and children as the building would be
fired (...) if necessary to take him dead or alive.
There is also the interesting case in which a complex
entity which is doubtful enters into a proposition. This is
done by placing the complex entity into the protasis,
together with ever, and referring to it in the apodosis
(3/17):
(149) If there was ever a thought in her mind that
(...), it was now dispelled.
It might be thought that this is a special case of a
conditional speech act. However it differs from the latter
in that the protasis proposition is not thought by the
writer to be decidable by the reader. Rather it is in the
nature of a hedge against a possible, but not highly
probable, state presupposed by the apodosis. Thus we
have classified it as having no inference relation from the
protasis to the apodosis.
However there is some relationship between the
protasis and the apodosis, best characterised as an
alternative relationship. The apodosis proposition is
doubtful because one aspect, x, within it may not be
applicable. Thus where x occurs in the apodosis
proposition there must be (x v not-p), e.g. 10 could be:
number of areas (small v not-one).
This proposal is related to material implication in
standard symbolic logic: p x is equivalent to not-p v x.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998760040540541">
Can this use of if not be derived from another use of if,
together with not, or is it a different use in its own right?
There are three possibilities for the derivation: that the
if not phrase is derived from an if not clause, that the
restrictive use is found with other SCs with not, and that
the restrictive use can be derived from another use of if
in a phrase.
Consider the first possibility, i.e. that the restrictive
use of an if not phrase is simply an abbreviated form for
an entire clause, e.g. 102 would be derived from:
(102&apos;) And if social relations arising out of business
ties do not impose sympathy, they impose
courtesy toward (...)
But if this is the case then 102&apos; should be either a
standard conditional use of if or one of the non standard
uses. It is certainly not a standard use as the apodosis, at
least of the original, is asserted simpliciter. However,
neither is it a factual use as the protasis is not asserted,
but left open. This suggests that it might be a conditional
speech act; but 102&apos; lacks an important feature of
conditional speech acts, namely that the speaker expects
the listener to know whether the protasis proposition is
true or not. So, while the restrictive use of if not to
introduce a phrase can be derived from an if not clause,
this does not help matters as this use would in itself be
different from any other.
The second possibility is that the restrictive use of if
not occurs with other SCs. There is only one other SC
that has this syntactic construction, namely although.
However semantically there is a difference from this
concessive use of although, e.g. •
Most although not all adolescents in our society (...)
is definitely a restriction to &apos;not all adolescents&apos; rather
than a possible restriction to &apos;all adolescents&apos;. So there is
NO similar use for the other SCs that is semantically
equivalent to this restrictive use of if not.
We turn now to the last possibility, other if phrases.
There are two: the concessive use (see below) and the
doubting of a presupposition. To show that the restrictive
use cannot be derived from the concessive use consider
this ambiguous example:
The establishment offered a longlasting, if not
permanent, cure.
This can have a restrictive interpretation, i.e. that the
cure is certainly longlasting and may well be permanent.
But it can also have a concessive interpretation as can be
seen when &apos;not permanent&apos; is replaced by &apos;temporary&apos;:
The establishment offered a longlasting, if
temporary, cure.
So the restrictive use cannot be derived from combining
not with the concessive use of if (otherwise there would
be no ambiguity).
Rather the restrictive use is semantically equivalent
to the use of doubting a presupposition. The relationship
in the latter case we have classified as (x v not-p), where
x is an entity in the apodosis. The restrictive use is
identical. For a sentence of the form q if not p, the
relationship is (x v p), where once again x is an entity in
the apodosis. For example the relevant phrase in 105
could be formalised as
number of adolescents (large v all).
Compare this with the formalisation for &apos;few areas if
any&apos;:
number of areas (small v not-one).
While the equivalence to the if of doubtful
presupposition holds at this level, restrictive if has a
different function. In the former the protasis introduces a
doubt about the legitimacy of something presupposed in
the main clause; the latter proposes a possible
replacement for something in the main clause.
We conclude that the restrictive use of if not is
derivable from the same logical structure as the use of if
to doubt a presupposition and so does NOT introduce a
new meaning of if.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.433768">
Concessives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.54045175">
Another use of if in which the apodosis proposition is
true and in which there is no inference relation, is a
concessive use. It occurs only with an adjective in the
protasis:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962995333333333">
(5) (...) now that you have finally grown up, if a
little late (...)
(121) (...) a well known establishment for the speedy
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995927">
if temporary rehabilitation of drunkards (...)
This use cannot be reduced to the standard conditional
meaning of if by claiming that the phrase in the protasis
has been reduced from some complete clause. If we try to
do so, as in:
(5&apos;) You have finally grown up, if you have grown up
a little late.
the result is not a standard conditional but rather a
factual, but one which contains new information in the
protasis; no such factuals occurred in our sample. So the
concessive use of if phrases cannot be derived from a
underlying if clause use.
As we have already seen, it is possible that a non
standard use of if has a counterpart with other SCs. The
Only other SC that permits a similar construction is
although:
You have finally grown up, although a little late.
which is almost a paraphrase of 5. But it is unlikely that
this concessive use of if is a &apos;mistake&apos; for although;
certain authors use concessive if phrases consistently,
e.g. Schoenberger (1969). A possible difference between
the two is that the adjective following although is
definitely applicable, c.f.
A speedy although temporary rehabilitation.
A speedy if temporary rehabilitation.
This suggests that there is a relation between the
concessive use and the use to indicate a doubtful
presupposition. Here what is put into doubt is not the
presupposition but a likely connotation of a word, e.g.
rehabilitations are normally permanent. However the
logical relation is NOT the same, e.g. it is not the case
that &apos;speedy if temporary rehabilitation&apos; can be
formalised by:
time for rehabilitation (short)

duration of rehabilitation (permanent v temporary).
So the concessive use of if cannot be reduced to the use
to doubt a presupposition. We have also shown that it
cannot be derived from a standard or factual if clause;
nor do other SCs exhibit the same phenomenon. So the
concessive use of if must be considered as being based on
a different meaning of if.

One of the uses of if that, within our sample, occurs
only within reported speech, is when the speaker puts
forward a possibility which in itself is sufficient to cause
a reaction in the listener:
(187) &amp;quot;If you want to see&amp;quot; ... &amp;quot;Never mind&amp;quot;, she said
sternly.
(200) &amp;quot;But if you say you managed it ---&amp;quot; The stanger
was hooked.
It is the pragmatics of the context that leads to the
protasis being sufficient to cause the speaker to stop or
the listener to interrupt, so no new meaning of if is
required.

Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997384375">
The non standard examples of if sentences have been
divided into 9 sub-categories within the three categories
that we proposed above. Is there any post hoc rationale
that can be given for these categories? Are they
necessary or complete?
Within category A, in which the protasis proposition
DOES have a truth value, there are two subcategories,
counterfactuals and factuals, which correspond to the
protasis proposition being false and true respectively.
However this is not the only difference between the two:
counterfactuals have a standard inference relation from
the protasis to the apodosis proposition, while factuals do
not. For the factuals it is the speech act that is
conditional upon the protasis proposition.
Why is it that we do not find two other sub-
categories: false protasis with conditional speech act and
true protasis with standard inference? There is no
pragmatic situation in which the former might occur; if
both the writer and the reader know that the protasis
proposition is false, then the speech act would never be
accepted at all. For the latter there is another SC which
fulfills the function, namely non-temporal since.
Neither do we find the condition falling within the
scope of a performative verb in category A. It cannot
occur with counterfactuals as the performative would
have to be countered in which case it would no longer be
performed, e.g.
I would have promised to marry him if he had asked
me.
is simply no promise at all but a standard counterfactual.
Neither have we been able to construct a factual within a
performative. So there are no sub-categories missing
from A.
Within the B1 category, with non standard inference,
we find a symmetrical situation. For the conditional
speech act, the speech act is moved IN to within the
scope of the protasis; for the performative use the main
verb in the apodosis is moved OUT beyond the scope of
the protasis. Thus we do not expect to find further sub-
categories within Bl.
Within the B2 category, in which the inference
relation is absent, we found 5 sub-categories within the
sample. In the sub-category in which if introduces a noun
clause there is no apodosis; if is being used just to
introduce a proposition with unknown truth value. There
is another sub-category with no apodosis, when the
protasis is sufficient for the speaker to stop.
The remaining 3 sub-categories within B2 are all
related in several ways: the protasis may be a phrase (in
two cases, restricitive and concessive use, it MUST be a
phrase); while the protasis is in doubt the apodosis
proposition is true, with a minor exception; this exception
is being put forward in the protasis as possibly although
not necessarily the case. In the restrictive use (if not) the
writer suggests the possibility of a further restriction to
one of the features of the apodosis; in the. use to doubt a
presupposition, the apodosis, on the contrary, goes too far
in one of its presuppostions; in the concessive use it is not
something as strong as a presupposition that goes too far
but just a likely connotation of a phrase within the
apodosis. While there is some pattern to this B2 category,
we believe that it is essentially open; innovative uses of
if will be found here rather than in the other two
categories.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958185185185">
We have found 9 different non standard uses of if, as
summarised in Table 1. However this does not require
there to be 9 different meanings for if. Three meanings
are sufficient.
Four of the different uses are explainable by
pragmatic considerations, a point we made when
criticising Austin&apos;s claim. His two ifs are the two uses in
category Bl; the differences arise from differences in the
scopes of the speech act and the conditional and are
common to other SCs. The factual use occurs when both
the writer and reader know that the protasis proposition
is true and is used for emphasis. Lastly the protasis may
occur without an apodosis when the speaker is
interrupted. All four uses are based on the standard
conditional meaning of if; the non standard uses arises
from pragmatic considerations.
The counterfactual use arises from an interaction
with the subjunctive mode in the apodosis. This is
common to other SCs and so does not require an apart
meaning of if.
The use of if to introduce a noun clause DOES require
an apart meaning of if as no inference relation is present.
This suggests that the feature of if to introduce a
proposition of unknown truth value is predominant over
the inference relationship feature. The factual use of if is
the only use in which the former feature is absent; then it
is a stylistic consideration that leads to the use of if, i.e.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.990162811594203">
to add emphasis.
The three remaining uses are possible candidates for a
third meaning of if, as none display an inference
relationship. These uses cannot be accounted for by some
pragmatic variation of the standard conditional, such as a
shift in the scope of the speech act, nor are similar uses
found with other SCs in general. In two of these uses,
restrictive and concessive, the protasis must be a phrase;
but these phrases cannot be derived from a corresponding
standard conditional clause.
Two uses, doubtful presuppostion and restrictive, have
a semantic feature in common, namely that there is some
feature of the apodosis, x, which may need to be
modified. We propose that if here has a meaning
equivalent to material implication, i.e. x v not-p, which is
equivalent to p x. This is the traditional logicians
suggestion for the standard meaning of if.
We do not accept that in the standard conditional use
the meaning of if is equivalent to material implication;
such an equivalence runs into difficulties. For instance it
requires the equivalence of:
If I hit you, it&apos;ll hurt.
Either I don&apos;t hit you or you&apos;ll be hurt.
and such unacceptable reasoning as:
God doesn&apos;t exist, so if God exists we are free to do
what we want.
Several attempts to save the equivalence have been
made. For instance Grice (1967) did so by requiring that
speakers adhere to certain conversational implicatures,
such as saying as much as they know, thus ruling out the
use of a conditional if sentences with a false protasis.
Formal semanticists propose some slight modifications.
For instance Stalnaker (1975) claimed that in any context
in which a sentence of the form not-p or q is acceptable,
a sentence of the form if p then q is also acceptable.
Elsewhere (Bree, 1981) we have taken issue with these
and other attempts to demonstrate equivalence of if with
material implication.
However in the use of if to doubt a presupposition or
to make a restriction, the meaning of if can be
considered to be equivalent to material implication. It
also occurs infrequently (3%) with standard conditionals:
(62) (...) if I don&apos;t put my two cents in, someone else
will.
in which there is no inferential relation. This meaning
differs from our standard meaning in that the truth of the
apodosis proposition is sufficient to confirm the sentence,
e.g. knowing that &apos;someone else will&apos; is sufficient to
confirm 62. Similarly for two other uses: with the
doubtful presupposition use of if, knowing that the
apodosis is true is sufficient to confirm the sentence, as
the presupposition is no longer in doubt; with the
restricitve use, the apodosis is the minimal assertion that
is being made so its truth is sufficient for the truth of the
sentence. So the x v not-p, or material implication,
meaning of if accounts for these two uses of if.
The last non standard use of if, the concessive, is an
anomaly. There is no question of inference, but neither is
there any affinity with material implication, e.g.
speedy if temporary # speedy or not temporary.
It is possible that this use is a contraction from even if.
We refrain from suggesting a fourth meaning of if. We
would expect that translations into other languages would
not be to the conditional, e.g. with Dutch if in such
expressions is translated using zij het, literally be it.
In conclusion, we propose that if has three different
meanings, all of which have one feature in common: the
truth status of the protasis is in doubt. They are, in order
of frequency of occurence in our sample:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988127111111111">
1. inferential (p-.q): as used in standard, counterfactual
and factual conditionals, together with the conditional
speech act, the performative conditional and the use
of the protasis without an apodosis (in this last case
the inference is left open);
2. material implication (q v not-p): as used in a few
standard conditionals, for doubting a presupposition
and in the restrictive use;
3. doubting: as used in noun clauses, in which only the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999640434782609">
truth of the associated proposition is put into doubt.
We expect that other languages will use different words
for these three meanings. This is the case in Dutch, for
example, where the uses depending on an inferential
meaning are indicated by als or the more formal indien,
the material implication by zo and doubting by of (which
is also used to translate whether). There is only one
exception to this, the factual. use in Dutch is not
indicated by als but by a change in word order.
Any computer program which purports to understand
the English language will need to be able to distinguish
between these three different meanings. The last,
doubting, is easy to detect as if is then used to introduce
a noun clause as opposed to a sub clause. However
distinguishing between the inferential and material
implication is not solvable on syntactic grounds. One
suggestion is to assume that if has an inferential
meaning; if no inference relation can be found, then it
must be equivalent to material implication. This shoulci
be easy to decide when if is being used to put a
presupposition into doubt or in its restrictive use; more
difficult would be to detect material implication in
standard uses of if.

These uses of among the 9 different non standard uses which we found in a sample of taken from the Brown University corpus: I. Counterfactual: If E had stuck to his plan he&apos;d still be famous. 2. Factual: If R was a liar, he was also a canny gentleman. 3. Conditional speech act: You may come back to Strasbourg, now, if you wish. 4.

Each use was examined to see whether it could be for by the standard meaning of with other features of the sentence. Similar differences in usage should then be found with other SCs. This was case for the first four uses. In three uses (6,7,8) if may/must occur in a phrase rather than in a full clause. The hypothesis that these uses can be derived from the meaning of an equivalent clause was explored and rejected. Two of these uses (6,7) require a implication interpretation of necessary for a few of the standard conditional sentences. Two uses (5,9) require only that the truth value of the following clause/phrase is unspecified. This is a property that all the uses have in common (with the exception of the factual use where the truth of the protasis is used to emphasise the truth of the apodosis) and is thus the that relates the different meanings of standard use and the non standard uses using the standard meaning (1,2,3,4) require, in addition, that there is an relation from the protasis (the clause) to apodosis (the main clause in which the is embedded). we propose that three different meanings of required: inference (including the standard use), material implication (uses 6,7) and just doubting the truth value of the following proposition (uses 5,9). Each of these three uses may be expected to be translated by different words in other languages, e.g. in Dutch by als, zo and of (except for use 8) respectively.</abstract>

Thus 2 is: If you want biscuits, accept the declaration that there are some on the table. This act of speech is to be noticed only when the proposition underlying the protasis (the if clause) holds; it is NOT made simpliciter. This explanation of the reading of Austin&apos;s two ifs, based on the relative scopes of the speech act and if, can be extended to other subordinating conjunctions (SC&apos;s), e.g. promise to marry him unless/provided/when he&apos;s rich. The case for the non-restrictive use, with the speech act falling within the scope of the SC was made by Rutherford (1970), e.g. He&apos;ll marry you, unless I&apos;m mistaken. In view of this generality it is parsimonious to regard Austin&apos;s two ifs as two different uses arising out of the context of the speech act, rather than as two different meanings of if. Rejecting Austin&apos;s ifs as possible contenders for an if&apos; having a non standard meaning does not, however, show that there are no non standard meanings. In fact the 0.E.D suggests 9 different uses of if: I. conditional; 2. semi-factual; 3. counterfactual; 4. a pregnant sense, e.g. If they are poor, they are at any rate happy; 5. an archaic use with that; 6. an ellipti</context>

So the concessive use of if phrases cannot be derived from a underlying if clause use. As we have already seen, it is possible that a non standard use of if has a counterpart with other SCs. The Only other SC that permits a similar construction is although: You have finally grown up, although a little late. which is almost a paraphrase of 5. But it is unlikely that this concessive use of if is a &apos;mistake&apos; for although; certain authors use concessive if phrases consistently, e.g. Schoenberger (1969). A possible difference between the two is that the adjective following although is definitely applicable, c.f. A speedy although temporary rehabilitation. A speedy if temporary rehabilitation. This suggests that there is a relation between the concessive use and the use to indicate a doubtful presupposition. Here what is put into doubt is not the presupposition but a likely connotation of a word, e.g. rehabilitations are normally permanent. However the logical relation is NOT the same, e.g. it is not the case that &apos;speedy if temporary rehabilitation&apos; can be formalised by: time for rehabilitat</context>

So we propose that three different meanings of if are required: inference (including the standard use), material implication (uses 6,7) and just doubting the truth value of the following proposition (uses 5,9). Each of these three uses may be expected to be translated by different words in other languages, e.g. in Dutch by als, zo and of (except for use 8) respectively. INTRODUCTION There has long been, and still is, a controversy about the meaning of if (e.g. Grice, 1967; Stalnaker, 1975; Harper et al, 1981). Much of this discussion presupposes that there is indeed one meaning of if. Is this presupposition justified? At one level the answer is clearly &apos;no&apos;, e.g. if can be used to introduce a noun clause following an illocutionary verb: John asked if he could come in now. Such examples do not conform to the conditional use of if as in: If John asked he could come in now. This is so different a use of if that one might claim it should be set aside from the .conditional if. Thus there would be two ifs: if&apos; for subordinate clauses and if&amp;quot; for noun clauses. Our question should be </context>

For instance it requires the equivalence of: If I hit you, it&apos;ll hurt. Either I don&apos;t hit you or you&apos;ll be hurt. and such unacceptable reasoning as: God doesn&apos;t exist, so if God exists we are free to do what we want. Several attempts to save the equivalence have been made. For instance Grice (1967) did so by requiring that speakers adhere to certain conversational implicatures, such as saying as much as they know, thus ruling out the use of a conditional if sentences with a false protasis. Formal semanticists propose some slight modifications. For instance Stalnaker (1975) claimed that in any context in which a sentence of the form not-p or q is acceptable, a sentence of the form if p then q is also acceptable. Elsewhere (Bree, 1981) we have taken issue with these and other attempts to demonstrate equivalence of if with material implication. However in the use of if to doubt a presupposition or to make a restriction, the meaning of if can be considered to be equivalent to material implication. It also occurs infrequently (3%) with standard conditionals: (62) (...) if I don&apos;t put my two cents in, someone else will. in which there is no inferential relation. This</context>
