In this paper we investigate temporal pat-
terns of web search queries. We carry out
several evaluations to analyze the proper-
ties of temporal profiles of queries, reveal-
ing promising semantic and pragmatic re-
lationships between words. We focus on
two applications: query suggestion and
query categorization. The former shows
a potential for time-series similarity mea-
sures to identify specific semantic relat-
edness between words, which results in
state-of-the-art performance in query sug-
gestion while providing complementary
information to more traditional distribu-
tional similarity measures. The query cat-
egorization evaluation suggests that the
temporal profile alone is not a strong in-
dicator of broad topical categories.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999902628571429">
The temporal patterns of word occurrences in hu-
man communication carry an implicit measure of
their relationship to real-world events and behav-
ioral patterns. For example, when there is an event
affecting a given entity (such as a natural disaster
in a country), the entity name will turn up more
frequently in human conversation, newswire arti-
cles and web documents; and people will search
for it more often. Two entities that are closely
related in the real world, such as the name of a
country and a prominent region inside the coun-
try are likely to share common events and there-
fore be closely associated in human communica-
tion. Finally, two instances of the same class
are also likely to share common usage patterns.
For example, names of airlines or retail stores are
more likely to be used by day rather than by night
(Chien, 2005).
In this paper we explore the linguistic relation-
ship between phrases that are judged to be sim-
ilar based on their frequency time series correla-
tion in search query logs. For every phrase1 avail-
able in WordNet 3.02 (Miller, 1995), we have ob-
tained its temporal signature from query logs, and
calculated all their pairwise correlations. Next,
we study the relationship in the top-ranked pairs
with respect to their distribution in WordNet and a
human-annotated labelling.
We also discuss possible applications of this
data to solve open problems and present the results
of two experiments: one where time series corre-
lations turned out to be highly discriminative; and
another where they were not particularly informa-
tive but shed some light on the nature of temporal
semantics and topical categorization:

<listItem confidence="0.962919166666667">
• Query suggestion, i.e. given a query, generate
a ranked list of alternative queries in which
the user may be interested.
• Query categorization, i.e. given a predefined
set of categories, find the top categories to
which the query can be assigned.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996082642857143">
Finally, we illustrate with an example another ap-
plication of time series in solving information ex-
traction problems.
Although query logs are typically proprietary
data, there are ongoing initiatives, like the Lemur
toolbar3, which make this kind of information
available for research purposes. Other work
(Bansal and Koudas, 2007b; Bansal and Koudas,
2007a) shows that temporal information can also
be extracted from public data, such as blogs. More
traditional types of text, such as news, are also typ-
ically associated with temporal labels; e.g., dates
and timestamps.

The study of query time series explores a particu-
lar instance of the so-called wisdom of the crowds
effect. Within this area, we can distinguish two
kinds of phenomena. Knowledge and resources
assembled by people explicitly, either individu-
ally, such as the case of blogs, or in a collabora-
tive way, as in forums or wikis. These resources
are valuable for human-consumption and can also
be exploited in order to learn computational re-
sources (Medelyan et al., 2008; Weld et al., 2008;
Zesch et al., 2008b; Zesch et al., 2008a). On
the other hand, it is possible to acquire useful re-
sources and knowledge from aggregating behav-
ioral patterns of large groups of people, even in
the absence of a conscious effort. There is exten-
sive ongoing research on the use of web search
usage patterns to develop knowledge resources.
Some examples are clustering co-click patterns to
learn semantically related queries (Beeferman and
Berger, 2000), combining co-click patterns with
hitting times (Mei et al., 2008), analyzing query
revisions made by users when querying search en-
gines (Jones et al., 2006), replacing query words
with other words that have the highest pointwise
mutual information (Terra and Clarke, 2004), or
using the temporal distribution of words in docu-
ments to improve ranking of search results (Jones
and Diaz, 2007).
Within this second category, an important area
is dedicated to the study of time-related features
of search queries. News aggregators use real-time
frequencies of user queries to detect spikes and
identify news shortly after the spikes occur (Mu-
rata, 2008). Web users’ query patterns have also
proved useful for building a real-time surveillance
system that accurately estimates region-by-region
influenza activity with a lag of one day (Ginsberg
et al., 2009). Search engines specifically devel-
oped for real-time searches, like Twitter search,
will most likely provide new use cases and sce-
narios for quickly detecting trends in user search
query patterns.

[gazpacho] and [summertime] (normalized
scales).
Our study builds upon the work of Chien
(2005), who observed that queries with highly-
correlated temporal usage patterns are typically
semantically related, and described a procedure
for calculating the correlations efficiently. We
have extended the analysis described in this work,
by performing a more extensive evaluation of the
kinds of semantic relationships that we can find
among temporally-similar queries. We also pro-
pose, to our knowledge for the first time, areas
of applications in solving well-established prob-
lems which shed some light on the nature of time-
based semantic similarity. This work is also re-
lated to the analysis of temporal properties of
information streams in data mining (Kleinberg,
2006) and information retrieval from time series
databases (Agrawal et al., 1993).

<bodyText confidence="0.996463727272727">
Similarly to the method described in Chien (2005),
we take a time interval, divide it into equally
spaced subintervals, and represent each phrase of
interest as the sequence of frequencies with which
the phrase was observed in the subintervals. In
our experiments, we have used as source data
the set of fully anonymized query logs from the
Google search engine between January 1st, 2004
and March 1st, 2009.4.
These data have been aggregated on a daily ba-
sis so that we have the daily frequency of the

queries of interest for over five years. The frequen-
cies are then normalized with the total number of
queries that happened on that day. The normaliza-
tion is necessary to avoid daily and seasonal varia-
tions as there are typically more queries on week-
days than on weekends and fewer queries during
holiday seasons than in the rest of the year. It
also helps reducing the effect deriving from the
fact that the population with Internet access is still
monotonically growing, so we can expect that the
number of queries will become higher and higher
over time.
Given two phrases and their associated time se-
ries, the similarity metric used is the correlation
coefficient between the two series (Chien, 2005).
For illustration, Figure 1 shows the time series ob-
tained for two sample queries, gazpacho and sum-
mertime, whose time series yield a correlation of
0.92. Similar high correlations can be observed
with other queries related to phenomena that oc-
cur mainly in summer in the countries from which
most queries come, like summer rash.

3.1 WordNet-based evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997972">
In this section, we describe a study carried out
with the purpose of discovering the traditional
lexico-semantic relationships which hold between
the queries that are most strongly related accord-
ing to their temporal profiles.
For this evaluation, we have taken the nomi-
nal phrases appearing in WordNet 3.0. Given that
users, when writing queries, typically do not pay
attention to punctuation and case, we have normal-
ized all phrases by lowercasing them and remov-
ing all punctuation. Next, we collected the time se-
ries for each phrase by computing the normalized
daily frequency of each of them as exact queries
in the query logs. The computation of the pair-
wise correlations was performed in parallel using
the MapReduce infrastructure running over 2048
cores with 500 MB of RAM each. The total ex-
ecution (including data shuffling and networking
time) took approximately three hours.
Next, we represented the data as a complete
graph where phrases are nodes and the edge be-
tween each pair of nodes is weighted by their time
series correlation. Using a simple graph-cut we
obtained clusters of related terms. A minimum
weight threshold equal to 0.9 was applied;5 thus,
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.93339">
5This threshold is the same used by Chien (2005), and was
confirmed after a manual inspection of a sample of the data
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.989252423076923">
two phrases belong to the same cluster if there is
a path between them only via edges with weight
over 0.9.
The previous procedure produced a set of 604
clusters, with highly different sizes. The first ob-
servation is that 70% of the phrases in WordNet
do not have a correlation over 0.9 with any other
phrase, so they are placed alone in singleton clus-
ters. There are several reasons for this. The clus-
ters obtained are very specific: only phrases that
have a very strong temporal association have tem-
poral correlations exceeding the threshold. This is
combined with the fact that we are using a very
restricted vocabulary, namely the terms included
in WordNet, which is many orders of magnitude
smaller than the vocabulary of all possible queries
from the users. Few phrase pairs in WordNet
have a temporal association and popularity strong
enough to be clustered together. Finally, many of
the phrases in WordNet are rare, including scien-
tific names of animals and plants, genuses or fami-
lies, which are not commonly used. Therefore, the
clusters extracted here correspond to very salient
sets of phrases. If, instead of WordNet, we choose
a vocabulary from known user queries (cf. Sec-
tion 4), there would be many fewer singleton clus-
ters, as the options of similar phrases to choose
from would be much larger.
From the phrases that belong to clusters, 25%
of the WordNet phrases do not have strong daily
temporal profiles. The typical pattern for these
terms is an almost flat time series, usually with
small drops at summertime and Christmas (when
seasonal leisure-related queries dominate). There-
fore, these phrases were collected in just one clus-
ter containing them all. Typical examples of the
elements of this set are names of famous scientists
and mathematicians (Gauss, Isaac Newton, Al-
bert Einstein, Thomas Alva Edison, Hipprocrates,
Gregor Mendel, ...), common terms (fertilization,
famine, macroeconomics, genus, nationalism, ...),
numbers and common first names, among other
things. It is possible that using sub-day intervals
might help to discriminate within this cluster.
The items in this big cluster contrast with pe-
riodical events, which display recurring patterns
(e.g., queries related to elections or tax-returns),
and names of famous people and other entities
which appeared in the news in the past few years.
All of these are associated with irregular, spiky
time series. These constitute the final 5% of the

Table 1 shows the relationships that hold be-

smaller clusters. Out of 2520 pairs, 283 belong
to the same synset, 697 are related via hyponymy
links, 60 via meronymy links, and 471 by alternat-

When the phrases were polysemous, the short-
est path between any of their meaning was used.
About 40% of the relations do not have a clear
structural interpretation in WordNet.
The majority of pairs are related via more or
less complex paths in the WordNet graph. Inter-
estingly, even the structurally unrelated terms are
characterized by transparent relations in terms of
world knowledge, as it is the case between poppy
and veteran day. Note as well that sometimes a
WordNet term is used with a meaning not present
in WordNet or in a different language, which may
explain why aids has a very high correlation with
welt (AIDS and welt are both hyponyms of health
problem, but the correlation may be explained bet-
ter by the AIDS World Day, Welt Aids Tag in Ger-
man), and it also has a very high correlation with
sida, defined in WordNet as a genus of tropical
herbs, but which is in fact the translation of AIDS
into Spanish. These observations motivated an ad-
ditional manual labelling of the extracted pairs.

sired information (Beeferman and Berger, 2000;

tion dataset from (Alfonseca et al., 2009). It con-
tains a set of 57 queries and an average of 22 can-
didate query suggestions for each of them. Each
suggestion was rated by two human raters using
the 5-point Likert scale defined in (Sahami and
Heilman, 2006), from irrelevant to highly relevant.
The task involves providing a ranking of the sug-
gestions that most closely resembles the human
scores. The evaluation is based on standard IR
metrics: precision at 1, 3 and 5, and mean average
precision. In order to compute the precision- and
recall-based metrics, we infer a binary distinction
from the ratings: related or not related. The inter-
annotator agreement for this dataset given the bi-
nary classification as computed by Cohen’s Kappa
is 0.6171.
We used three baselines: the average values that
would be produced by a random scorer of the can-
didate suggestions, Sahami and Heilman (2006)’s
system (based on calculating similarities between
the retrieved snippets), and a recent competitive
ranker based on calculating standard distributional
similarities (Alfonseca et al., 2009) between the
original query and the suggestion. Please refer to
the referenced work for details.
In order to produce the ranked lists of candi-
date suggestions for each query, due to the lack of
training data, we have opted for the unsupervised
procedure described in the previous section:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97098425">
1. Collect the daily time series of each of the
queries and the candidate suggestions.
2. Calculate the correlation between the original
query and each of the candidate suggestions
provided for it, and use it as the candidate’s
score.
3. For each query, rank its candidate sugges-
tions in decreasing order of correlation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999388">
Finally, taking into account that the source of
similarity is very different to the one used for dis-
tributional similarity, we tested the hypothesis that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.559139">
1051
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958047619047">
a combination of the two techniques would be ben-
eficial to capture different features of the queries
and suggestions. We have trained a linear mixture
model combining both scores (time series and dis-
tributional similarities), using 10-fold cross vali-
dation.
The results are displayed in Table 4. For eval-
uating the results, whenever a system produced a
tie between several suggestions, we generated 100
random orderings of the elements in the tie, and
report the average scores.
Using distributional similarities and the tempo-
ral series turned out to be indistinguishable for the

significantly better than the similarity metric based
on the web kernel. The combination produced an
improvement across all metrics, although not sta-
tistically significant at p=0.05.
This is quite a positive finding as the time series
method relies on stored information requiring only
simple and highly optimized lookups.

5 Application to query categorization

<bodyText confidence="0.9999896875">
The results from the manual evaluation in Sec-
tion 3.2 support the conclusion that time series
from query logs provide powerful signals for clus-
tering at a fine-grained level, in some cases un-
covering synonyms (may 1st, may day) and even
causal relations (insulation, heating). A natural
question is if temporal information is correlated
with other types of categorizations. In this sec-
tion we carry out a preliminary exploration of the
relation between query time series and query cat-
egorization. To this extent we adapt the data from
the KDD 2005 CUP (Li et al., 2005), which pro-
vides a set of queries classified into 67 broad topi-
cal categories. Since the data is rather sparse (678
queries) we applied Fourier analysis to “smooth”
the time series.

5.3 Experiment and discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959384615385">
To explore the correlation between the structured
temporal representation of queries provided by the
time series and topical categorization we run the
following experiment. Each KDD Cup query was
reconstructed via RDFT using a variable number
of coefficients. The set of 679 queries was parti-
tioned in 10 sets and a 10-fold evaluation was per-
formed. For each fold we trained a classifier on the
remaining 9 folds. We used an average multi-class
perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999) adapted to
multi-label learning (Crammer and Singer, 2003).
Each model was trained on a fixed number of 10
iterations. The accuracy of each model was eval-
uated as the fraction of test items for which the
selected highest scoring class was in the gold stan-
dard set provided by the editors. As a lower bound
we estimated the accuracy of randomly choosing
a label for each test instance, and as a baseline we
used the most frequent label. The latter is a pow-
erful predictor: baselines based on class frequency
outperform most of the systems that participated in
the KDD Cup (Lin and Wu, 2009).
Table 5 reports the average accuracy over the
10 runs with relative standard errors. Each DFT-
based model is characterized by the number of co-
efficients used for the reconstruction. Two main
patterns are noticeable. First, none of the differ-
ences between the frequency-based baseline and
the DFT models is significant, this seems to indi-
cate that temporal structure alone is not a good dis-
criminator of topic, at least of broad categories. In
retrospect, this is somewhat predictable. The tem-
poral dimension is a basic semantic component of
lexical meaning and world knowledge which is not
necessarily associated with any broad, and to some
extent subjective, categorization. An inspection of
the patterns found in each category shows in fact
that similar patterns often emerge in different cat-
egories; e.g., “Halloween costume” and “cheese-
cake recipe” have a similar yearly periodical pat-
tern with spikes in early winter, while monotoni-
cally decaying patterns are shared across all cate-
gories; e.g., between computer hardware and kids
toys.
The second interesting finding is the trend of
the DFT system results, higher at low-intermediate
values, providing some initial promising evidence
that DFT analysis generates useful compressed
representations which could be indexed and ap-
plied efficiently. Notice that the sequences recon-
structed using 1,000 coefficients reproduce almost
identically the original signals.

6 Applications in information extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999422">
Time series from query logs are particularly rel-
evant for phrases that refer to entities which are
involved in recent events. Therefore, we expect
them to be useful for solving other applications
that require handling entities, such as named en-
tity recognition and classification, relation extrac-
tion or disambiguation.
To illustrate this point, we mention an example
of relation extraction between actors and movies:
movies usually have spikes when they are re-
leased, and then the frequency again drops sharply.
At the same times, when a movie is released, the
search engine users have a renewed interest in
their actors. Figure 3 displays the time series for
the five most recent movies by Jim Carrey (as of
march 2009), and the time series for Jim Carrey.
As can be seen, the spikes are at exactly the same
points in time. If we add up the series (a) through
(e) into a single series and calculate the correlation
with (f), it turns out to be very high (0.88).

To validate the hypothesis that this data should
be useful for identifying related entities, we have
performed a small experiment in the following
way: by choosing five popular actors8 and the cin-
ema movies in which they appear since the year
2004, obtained from IMDB9. Using the time se-
ries, for each actor we choose the combination of
movies such that, by adding up the time series of
those movies, we maximise the correlation with
the actor’s time series. It has been implemented
with a greedy beam search, with a beam size of
100. The results are shown in Table 6. The random
baseline randomly associates the movies from the
dataset with the five actors.
We do not believe this to be a perfect feature as,
for example, actors may have a peak in the time se-
ries related to their personal lives, not necessarily
to movies. However, the high correlations that can
be obtained when the pairing between actors and
movies is correct, and the improvement with re-
spect a random baseline, indicates this is a feature
which can probably be integrated with other re-
lation extraction systems when handling relation-
ships between entities that have big temporal de-
pendencies.

7 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994516129032">
This paper explores the relationships between
queries whose associated time series obtained
from query logs are highly correlated. The use
of time series in semantic similarity has been dis-
cussed by Chien (2005), but only a very prelimi-
nary evaluation was described, and, to our knowl-
edge, they had never been applied and evaluated
in solving existing problems. Our results indicate
that, for a substantial percentage of phrases in a
thesaurus, it is possible to find other highly-related
phrases; and we have categorized the kind of se-
mantic relationships that hold between them.
We have found that in a query suggestion
task, somewhat surprisingly, results are compara-
ble with other state-of-the-art techniques based on
distributional similarities. Furthermore, informa-
tion obtained from time series seems to be com-
plementary with them, as a simple combination of
similarity metrics produces an important increase
in performance..
From an analysis on a query categorization task
the initial evidence suggests that there is no strong
correlation between broad topics and temporal
profiles. This agrees with the intuition that time
provides a fundamental semantic dimension possi-
bly orthogonal to broad topical classification. This
issue however deserves further investigation. An-
other issue which is worth a deeper investigation
is the application of Fourier transform methods
which offer tools for studying the periodic struc-
ture of the temporal sequences.

We carry out several evaluations to analyze the properties of temporal profiles of queries, revealing promising semantic and pragmatic relationships between words. We focus on two applications: query suggestion and query categorization. The former shows a potential for time-series similarity measures to identify specific semantic relatedness between words, which results in state-of-the-art performance in query suggestion while providing complementary information to more traditional distributional similarity measures. The query categorization evaluation suggests that the temporal profile alone is not a strong indicator of broad topical categories.</abstract>

Finally, we illustrate with an example another application of time series in solving information extraction problems. Although query logs are typically proprietary data, there are ongoing initiatives, like the Lemur toolbar3, which make this kind of information available for research purposes. Other work (Bansal and Koudas, 2007b; Bansal and Koudas, 2007a) shows that temporal information can also be extracted from public data, such as blogs. More traditional types of text, such as news, are also typically associated with temporal labels; e.g., dates and timestamps. This paper is structured in the following way: 1We use the term phrase to refer to any single word or multi-word expression that belongs to a synset in WordNet.

There is extensive ongoing research on the use of web search usage patterns to develop knowledge resources.

Two entities that are closely related in the real world, such as the name of a country and a prominent region inside the country are likely to share common events and therefore be closely associated in human communication. Finally, two instances of the same class are also likely to share common usage patterns. For example, names of airlines or retail stores are more likely to be used by day rather than by night (Chien, 2005). In this paper we explore the linguistic relationship between phrases that are judged to be similar based on their frequency time series correlation in search query logs. For every phrase1 available in WordNet 3.02 (Miller, 1995), we have obtained its temporal signature from query logs, and calculated all their pairwise correlations. Next, we study the relationship in the top-ranked pairs with respect to their distribution in WordNet and a human-annotated labelling. We also discuss possible applications of this data to solve open problems and present the results of two experiments: one where </context>

Web users’ query patterns have also proved useful for building a real-time surveillance system that accurately estimates region-by-region influenza activity with a lag of one day (Ginsberg et al., 2009). Search engines specifically developed for real-time searches, like Twitter search, will most likely provide new use cases and scenarios for quickly detecting trends in user search query patterns. Figure 1: Time series obtained for the queries [gazpacho] and [summertime] (normalized scales). Our study builds upon the work of Chien (2005), who observed that queries with highlycorrelated temporal usage patterns are typically semantically related, and described a procedure for calculating the correlations efficiently. We have extended the analysis described in this work, by performing a more extensive evaluation of the kinds of semantic relationships that we can find among temporally-similar queries. We also propose, to our knowledge for the first time, areas of applications in solving well-established problems which shed some light on the nature of timebased semantic similarity. This work is also related to the analysis of temp</context>

The normalization is necessary to avoid daily and seasonal variations as there are typically more queries on weekdays than on weekends and fewer queries during holiday seasons than in the rest of the year. It also helps reducing the effect deriving from the fact that the population with Internet access is still monotonically growing, so we can expect that the number of queries will become higher and higher over time. Given two phrases and their associated time series, the similarity metric used is the correlation coefficient between the two series (Chien, 2005). For illustration, Figure 1 shows the time series obtained for two sample queries, gazpacho and summertime, whose time series yield a correlation of 0.92. Similar high correlations can be observed with other queries related to phenomena that occur mainly in summer in the countries from which most queries come, like summer rash. 3.1 WordNet-based evaluation In this section, we describe a study carried out with the purpose of discovering the traditional lexico-semantic relationships which hold between the queries that are most strongly related according to their temporal profiles.

The computation of the pairwise correlations was performed in parallel using the MapReduce infrastructure running over 2048 cores with 500 MB of RAM each. The total execution (including data shuffling and networking time) took approximately three hours. Next, we represented the data as a complete graph where phrases are nodes and the edge between each pair of nodes is weighted by their time series correlation. Using a simple graph-cut we obtained clusters of related terms. A minimum weight threshold equal to 0.9 was applied;5 thus, 5This threshold is the same used by Chien (2005), and was confirmed after a manual inspection of a sample of the data two phrases belong to the same cluster if there is a path between them only via edges with weight over 0.9. The previous procedure produced a set of 604 clusters, with highly different sizes. The first observation is that 70% of the phrases in WordNet do not have a correlation over 0.9 with any other phrase, so they are placed alone in singleton clusters. There are several reasons for this. The clusters obtained are very specific: only phrases that have a very strong temporal association have temporal correlations exceeding </context>

The use of time series in semantic similarity has been discussed by Chien (2005), but only a very preliminary evaluation was described, and, to our knowledge, they had never been applied and evaluated in solving existing problems. Our results indicate that, for a substantial percentage of phrases in a thesaurus, it is possible to find other highly-related phrases; and we have categorized the kind of semantic relationships that hold between them. We have found that in a query suggestion task, somewhat surprisingly, results are comparable with other state-of-the-art techniques based on distributional similarities.

A natural question is if temporal information is correlated with other types of categorizations. In this section we carry out a preliminary exploration of the relation between query time series and query categorization. To this extent we adapt the data from the KDD 2005 CUP (Li et al., 2005), which provides a set of queries classified into 67 broad topical categories. Since the data is rather sparse (678 queries) we applied Fourier analysis to “smooth” the time series. 5.1 The KDD CUP data The KDD Cup 2005 6 introduced a query categorization task and dataset consisting of 800,000 unlabeled queries for unsupervised training, and an evaluation set of 911 queries, 111 for development and 800 for the final evaluation.

Each model was trained on a fixed number of 10 iterations. The accuracy of each model was evaluated as the fraction of test items for which the selected highest scoring class was in the gold standard set provided by the editors. As a lower bound we estimated the accuracy of randomly choosing a label for each test instance, and as a baseline we used the most frequent label. The latter is a powerful predictor: baselines based on class frequency outperform most of the systems that participated in the KDD Cup (Lin and Wu, 2009). Table 5 reports the average accuracy over the 10 runs with relative standard errors. Each DFTbased model is characterized by the number of coefficients used for the reconstruction. Two main patterns are noticeable. First, none of the differences between the frequency-based baseline and the DFT models is significant, this seems to indicate that temporal structure alone is not a good discriminator of topic, at least of broad categories. In retrospect, this is somewhat predictable. The temporal dimension is a basic semantic component of lexical meaning and world knowledge which is not necessari</context>

Finally, two instances of the same class are also likely to share common usage patterns. For example, names of airlines or retail stores are more likely to be used by day rather than by night (Chien, 2005). In this paper we explore the linguistic relationship between phrases that are judged to be similar based on their frequency time series correlation in search query logs. For every phrase1 available in WordNet 3.02 (Miller, 1995), we have obtained its temporal signature from query logs, and calculated all their pairwise correlations. Next, we study the relationship in the top-ranked pairs with respect to their distribution in WordNet and a human-annotated labelling. We also discuss possible applications of this data to solve open problems and present the results of two experiments: one where time series correlations turned out to be highly discriminative; and another where they were not particularly informative but shed some light on the nature of temporal semantics and topical categorization: • Query suggestion, i.e.</context>

News aggregators use real-time frequencies of user queries to detect spikes and identify news shortly after the spikes occur (Murata, 2008). Web users’ query patterns have also proved useful for building a real-time surveillance system that accurately estimates region-by-region influenza activity with a lag of one day (Ginsberg et al., 2009). Search engines specifically developed for real-time searches, like Twitter search, will most likely provide new use cases and scenarios for quickly detecting trends in user search query patterns.

For the manual analysis of the results, we randomly selected 332 clusters containing only two items (so that 664 phrases were considered in total). Each of these pairs has been classified in one of the previous categories. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 3. 4 Application to query suggestion Query suggestion is a feature of search engines that helps users reformulate queries in order to better describe their information need with the purpose of reducing the time needed to find the desired information (Beeferman and Berger, 2000; Kraft and Zien, 2004; Sahami and Heilman, 2006; Cucerzan and White, 2007; Yih and Meek, 2008). In this section, we explore the application of a similarity metric based on time series correlations for finding related queries to suggest to the users.

The task involves providing a ranking of the suggestions that most closely resembles the human scores. The evaluation is based on standard IR metrics: precision at 1, 3 and 5, and mean average precision. In order to compute the precision- and recall-based metrics, we infer a binary distinction from the ratings: related or not related. The interannotator agreement for this dataset given the binary classification as computed by Cohen’s Kappa is 0.6171. We used three baselines: the average values that would be produced by a random scorer of the candidate suggestions, Sahami and Heilman (2006)’s system (based on calculating similarities between the retrieved snippets), and a recent competitive ranker based on calculating standard distributional similarities (Alfonseca et al., 2009) between the original query and the suggestion. Please refer to the referenced work for details. In order to produce the ranked lists of candidate suggestions for each query, due to the lack of training data, we have opted for the unsupervised procedure described in the previous section: 1. Collect the daily time series of each of the queries and the candidate suggestions. 2. Calculate the correlation bet</context>
