This is a collection of papers on natural language
parsing and the formal description of natural languages.
Most of the papers were originally presented at an
interdisciplinary workshop, Word-order and Parsing in
Unification Grammars, that was held in Friedenweiler,
West Germany, in April 1986. However, two studies
have been especially written for this volume, and an
extensive introduction by Reyle and Rohrer has been
added to outline the contents of the book and to provide
the readers who are less familiar with unification-based
formalisms with the necessary background information
that the authors of the papers assumed to be known.
At the workshop mentioned above, the issue of the
possible contribution of linguistic theories to natural
language processing and vice versa was discussed. It
was also meant as a central topic of the book under
review (cf. its title), but in fact only one of the papers
(by Shieber, who opens the volume) is directly con-
cerned with the interplay between theoretical and com-
putational linguistics, while in others the subject is
touched on in a more or less parenthetical way. Gener-
ally, the authors agree that linguistic theories and nat-
ural language parsing may benefit from drawing on the
experience of each other; that an implementation of a
declaratively described theory may encounter difficul-
ties (cf. the paper by Boguraev, who demonstrates it
with the example of GPSG); and that linguists should
not be discouraged from inventing new grammar formal-
isms, and ease of implementation must not be the only
criterion for a linguistic theory. However, we do not go
far beyond remarks of this kind, and the contents of the
book may seem rather disappointing in comparison with
its promising title.
This does not lessen the value of particular contribu-
tions to the volume. Because German is, no wonder, the
language referred to in many of the papers, and French
as well as Japanese are represented too, the book does
not show the usual, though irritating, tendency of
computational linguistic literature to infer very general
statements concerning language on the basis of English
(as if there were no other languages in the world!). In
some of the papers, problems of German word order are
considered, as well as non-local dependencies and co-
ordination; in some others, questions of semantic rep-
resentation are addressed.
Most of the contributors to this volume work in the
framework of unification grammars (LFG and GPSG)
but there is also a paper on parsing with a Government
and Binding grammar (Wehrli), and two attempts to
combine unification with categorial grammars (Zeevat
and Whitelock). In addition, the applicability of indexed
grammars, which fall in between context-free and con-
text-sensitive grammars, is discussed (Gazdar).
Because of the wide range of issues it covers, the
book can serve as supplementary reading for advanced
courses in computational linguistics. Thus, apart from
scholars and programmers dealing with natural language
grammars and parsers, the work under review will
interest students and teachers.
Miroslaw Bank°, who is a lecturer at the Institute of Polish
Language, Warsaw University, has MSc,s in both computer
science and linguistics. His recent research has concentrated
on the problems of evaluating natural language parsers, and on
parsing Polish. Batiko&apos;s address is: Instytut Jczyka Polskiego,

This book describes work in the areas of semantics and
reference resolution for text understanding, exploring
the idea of early semantic analysis. These ideas were
implemented in a Prolog program for analyzing word
problems in physics at the University of Edinburgh as
part of the author&apos;s Ph.D. thesis.
Early semantic analysis is an attempt to &amp;quot;bring
forward parts of the semantic processing before or
during syntactic analysis&amp;quot; (p. 13). This means that
semantic interpretation goes on incrementally through-
out processing, rather than all at once at some pre-
defined point, such as immediately after parsing. In the
case of reference resolution, early semantic analysis
means that the text must be seen as incrementally
providing constraints on the types and identities of
entities mentioned. This information is input to a con-
straint-satisfaction procedure that evaluates references.
It seems that the system expects that eventually there
will be enough constraining information to narrow the
choice of candidates down to one, but it is not clear how
long the system will wait for such information, or what
it does if there isn&apos;t enough information available at the
time when it has to make a choice. Mellish discusses
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 1, March 1989 57
Book Reviews Briefly Noted
several potential mechanisms that might be used in
these cases, such as focusing (Sidner 1979), or prefer-
ence semantics (Wilks 1975), but none of them were
implemented.
Unfortunately, although early semantic analysis is an
intuitively plausible approach, and Mellish explores it
thoroughly, there are basic questions about its general-
ity and extensibility that are left unanswered. For
example, the system is unable to handle some very
central aspects of language, such as negation (&amp;quot;The
ends of the string are not fixed&amp;quot;) and generic reference
(&amp;quot;A string has two ends&amp;quot;). These problems arise from a
basic assumption in this system that noun phrases have
specific referents, and the system falls short when this
assumption is not met. If these problems are inevitable
consequences of early semantic analysis, then it is hard
to see how early semantic analysis could be used in a
realistic system. Mellish owes the reader a discussion of
these issues and not just a statement that handling them
would require a major revision.
Another disappointment is that there is no attempt to
integrate work done in the paradigm of focusing and
centering (Grosz 1977, Sidner 1979, Grosz et al. 1983)
with this approach. While this work may not have come
to the attention of Mellish while he was doing the
original work (1978-81), a detailed discussion of the
relevance of the focusing work to his work would have
been immensely valuable in the present volume. For
example, the notion of focusing (or the related concept
of centering (Grosz et al. 1983) can provide constraints
on referents (as suggested by Rich and Luper-Foy 1987)
and may be able to do some of the work that Mellish
assigns to domain-specific reasoning. Typically, work in
the focusing and centering paradigms has not been
concerned to any great extent with the role of domain-
specific reasoning. Because of this, an integration of
these two approaches would have been very valuable.
It would also have been interesting to see a discus-
sion of the pros and cons of using techniques like
focusing versus domain-specific reasoning in cases
where either could do the job. The exploration of early
semantic analysis would also have been much more
valuable if Mellish had spent more time discussing the
implications of this work for future work in computa-
tional linguistics. Does he believe that the shortcomings
in coverage that he points out mean that this work is just
an interesting blind alley? Are there parts of the work
that provide insights that should be used in future
systems? Discussions of these questions would have
been very helpful.
Mellish is refreshingly clear and explicit about the
limitations of his work. There is also a very useful and
detailed discussion of some relatively unexplored types
of noun phrases. For example, the program described
here has good coverage of some interesting types of
plural noun phrases, such as specific plurals with indef-
inite cardinality. An example of this is &amp;quot;Small blocks,
each of mass m, are clamped at the ends and at the
center of a light rod&amp;quot;. I am not aware of any other work
that addresses the problems of handling these kinds of
noun phrases to this extent.
This book contains some detailed information about
the program, including algorithms, actual code, and
traces of execution, which are very useful for under-
standing what is going on.
