developments that have taken place over the last decade in the field
of natural language semantics. Increasingly, its crucial relevance has
been recognized in practically all areas of natural language research.
High formal standards have been set as it has striven to meet the growing
need for computational and empirical adequacy. This process has been
aided by the intense interdisciplinary exchange and cooperation that has
simultaneously occurred, setting new standards for the field as a whole
and working toward a true integration.

CHALLENGES IN NATURAL
LANGUAGE PROCESSING
Madeleine Bates and
Ralph M. Weischedel, Editors
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.995419916666667">
Though natural language processing has
come far in the past twenty years, the
technology has not achieved a major
impact on society. Is this because of some
fundamental limitation that cannot be
overcome? Or because there has not been
enough time to refine and apply
theoretical work already done? In this
volume researchers tackle several critical
issues that have never before been
adequately addressed in either theoretical
or applied work.

This accessible introduction to formal,

within a linguistic framework,
presupposes no previous background in
logic, but it takes students step-by-step
from simple predicate/argument
structures and their interpretation to
Montague&apos;s intentional logic.

The formalization of default inheritance,
in particular, is discussed in detail, and

&amp;quot;Koslow&apos;s theory permits us to identifi
logical operators independent of their form

the possibility of an entirely new approach to
the study of natural-language semantics, one

Evolutionary Computation provides an international forum for
facilitating and enhancing the exchange of information
among researchers involved in both the theoretical and
practical aspects of computational systems of an evolutionary
nature.
Publishing both theoretical and practical developments of
computational systems drawing their inspiration from nature,
Evolutionary Computation places particular emphasis on
evolutionary models of computation such as genetic algo-
rithms (GAs), evolutionary strategies (ESs), classifier systems
(CSs), evolutionary programming (EP), and other evolution-
ary computation techniques.

Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues are
paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most
ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. A late payment fee will be charged for
renewals made after 1 April; this fee does not apply to new members. Institutions now subscribe to the journal
through MIT Press Journals, 55 Hayward Street, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; +1-617-253-2889. Back issues and
proceedings are available only from the ACL, except that institutions should backorder journals for 1988 and follow-
ing years through MIT Press. Payments for dues, back issues, and proceedings can be made in Europe and Japan as
well as the U.S. Read the directions under the heading PAYMENT below carefully. Identify institutional
affiliation, if it is not part of your address. Also provide telephone country &amp; region codes and computer network &amp;

Prepayment is necessary; invoices are available on request. The U.S. dollar price is definitive when paying in other
currencies, although rounding off is appropriate. Checks and money orders should be made out to the Association for
Computational Linguistics (or to ACL). ALL CREDITCARD PAYMENTS MUST BE MADE TO THE ACL
OFFICE IN THE USA; ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS ARE PREFERRED; send the information above from

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96350375">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.741808">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997097875">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. It also sponsors a series of books on natural language
processing through The MIT Press. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the
Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language Processing have been
formed; others are likely to be added.

Increasingly, its crucial relevance has been recognized in practically all areas of natural language research. High formal standards have been set as it has striven to meet the growing need for computational and empirical adequacy. This process has been aided by the intense interdisciplinary exchange and cooperation that has simultaneously occurred, setting new standards for the field as a whole and working toward a true integration.</abstract>
