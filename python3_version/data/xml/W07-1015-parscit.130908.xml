This paper describes a system capable of
semi-automatically filling an XML template
from free texts in the clinical domain (prac-
tice guidelines). The XML template includes
semantic information not explicitly encoded
in the text (pairs of conditions and ac-
tions/recommendations). Therefore, there is
a need to compute the exact scope of condi-
tions over text sequences expressing the re-
quired actions. We present a system devel-
oped for this task. We show that it yields
good performance when applied to the
analysis of French practice guidelines.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983454618181818">
During the past years, clinical practices have con-
siderably evolved towards standardization and ef-
fectiveness. A major improvement is the develop-
ment of practice guidelines (Brownson et al., 2 003).
However, even if widely distributed to hospitals,
doctors and other medical staff, clinical practice
guidelines are not routinely fully exploited&apos;. There
is now a general tendency to transfer these guide-
lines to electronic devices (via an appropriate XML
format). This transfer is justified by the assumption
that electronic documents are easier to browse than
paper documents.
However, migrating a collection of texts to XML
requires a lot of re-engineering. More precisely, it
means analyzing the full set of textual documents
so that they can fit with strict templates, as required
either by XML schemas or DTD (document type
definition). Unfortunately, most of the time, the
&apos; See (Kolata, 2004). This newspaper article is a good example
of the huge social impact of this research area.
semantic blocks of information required by the
XML model are not explicitly marked in the origi-
nal text. These blocks of information correspond to
discourse structures.
This problem has thus renewed the interest for
the recognition and management of discourse struc-
tures, especially for technical domains. In this
study, we show how technical documents belong-
ing to a certain domain (namely, clinical practice
guidelines) can be semi-automatically structured
using NLP techniques. Practice guidelines describe
best practices with the aim of guiding decisions and
criteria in specific areas of healthcare, as defined
by an authoritative examination of current evidence
(evidence-based medicine, see Wikipedia or
Brownson et al., 2 003).
The Guideline Elements Model (GEM) is an
XML-based guideline document model that can
store and organize the heterogeneous information
contained in practice guidelines (Schiffman, 2 000).
It is intended to facilitate translation of natural lan-
guage guideline documents into a format that can
be processed by computers. The main element of
GEM, knowledge component, contains the most
useful information, especially sequences of condi-
tions and recommendations. Our aim is thus to
format these documents which have been written
manually without any precise model, according to
the GEM DTD (see annex A).
The organization of the paper is as follows: first,
we present the task and some previous approaches
(section 2). We then describe the different process-
ing steps (section 3) and the implementation (sec-
tion 4). We finish with the presentation of some
results (section 5), before the conclusion (section 6).

2 Document Restructuring: the Case of
Practice Guidelines
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998969">
As we have previously seen, practice guidelines are
not routinely fully exploited. One reason is that
they are not easily accessible to doctors during
consultation. Moreover, it can be difficult for the
doctor to find relevant pieces of information from
these guides, even if they are not very long. To
overcome these problems, national health agencies
try to promote the electronic distribution of these
guidelines (so that a doctor could check recom-
mendations directly from his computer).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.951155">
2.1 Previous Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960436363636">
Several attempts have already been made to im-
prove the use of practice guidelines: for example
knowledge-based diagnostic aids can be derived
from them (e.g. S6roussi et al., 2 001).
GEM is an intermediate document model, be-
tween pure text (paper practice guidelines) and
knowledge-based models like GLIF (Peleg et al.,
2 000) or EON (Tu and Musen, 2 001). GEM is thus
an elegant solution, independent from any theory or
formalisms, but compliant with other frameworks.
GEM Cutter (http://gem.med.yale.edu/) is a
tool aimed at aiding experts to fill the GEM DTD
from texts. However, this software is only an inter-
face allowing the end-user to perform the task
through a time-consuming cut-and-paste process.
The overall process described in Shiffman et al.
(2 004) is also largely manual, even if it is an at-
tempt to automate and regularize the translation
process.
The main problem in the automation of the
translation process is to identify that a list of rec-
ommendations expressed over several sentences is
under the scope of a specific condition (conditions
may refer to a specific pathology, a specific kind of
patients, temporal restrictions, etc.). However, pre-
vious approaches have been based on the analysis
of isolated sentences. They do not compute the ex-
act scope of conditional sequences (Georg and
Jaulent, 2 005): this part of the work still has to be
done by hand.
Our automatic approach relies on work done in
the field of discourse processing. As we have seen
in the introduction, the most important sequences
of text to be tagged correspond to discourse struc-
tures (conditions, actions ...). Although most re-
searchers agree that a better understanding of text
structure and text coherence could help extract
knowledge, descriptive frameworks like the one
developed by Halliday and Hasan2 are poorly for-
malized and difficult to apply in practice.
Some recent works have proposed more opera-
tional descriptions of discourse structures (P�ry-
Woodley, 1998). Several authors (Halliday and
Matthiessen, 2 004; Charolles, 2 005) have investi-
gated the use of non-lexical cues for discourse
processing (e.g temporal adverbials like &amp;quot;in 1999&apos;).
These adverbials introduce situation frames in a
narrative discourse, that is to say a `period&apos; in the
text which is dependent from the adverbial.
We show in this study that condition sequences
play the same role in practice guidelines: their
scope may run over several dependent clauses
(more precisely, over a set of several recommenda-
tions). Our plan is to automatically recognize these
using surface cues and processing rules.

2.2 Our Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982872586206897">
Our aim is to semi-automatically fill a GEM tem-
plate from existing guidelines: the algorithm is
fully automatic but the result needs to be validated
by experts to yield adequate accuracy. Our system
tries to compute the exact scope of conditional se-
quences. In this paper we apply it to the analysis of
several French practice guidelines.
The main aim of the approach is to go from a
textual document to a GEM based document, as
shown on Figure 1 (see also annex A). We focus on
conditions (including temporal restrictions) and
recommendations since these elements are of
paramount importance for the task. They are espe-
cially difficult to deal with since they require to
accurately compute the scope of conditions.
The example on figure 1 is complex since it con-
tains several levels of overlapping conditions. We
observe a first opposition (Chez le sujet non immu-
nodeprime / chez le sujet immunodeprime... Con-
cerning the non-immuno-depressed patient / Con-
cerning the immuno-depressed patient...) but a sec-
ond condition interferes in the scope of this first
level (En cas d&apos;aspect normal de la muqueuse il6-
ale... If the ileal mucus seems normal...). The task
involves recognizing these various levels of condi-
tions in the text and explicitly representing them
through the GEM DTD.

We analyzed 18 French practice guidelines pub-

Agence Nationale d&apos;Accreditation et d&apos;Evaluation
en Sante and AFSSAPS, Agence Francaise de Se-
curite Sanitaire des Produits de Sante) between
2 000 and 2 005. These practice guidelines focus on
different pathologies (e.g. diabetes, high blood
pressure, asthma etc.) as well as with clinical
examination processes (e.g. digestive endoscopy).
amination processes (e.g. digestive endoscopy).
The data are thus homogeneous, and is about 25 0
pages long (15 0, 000+ words). Most of these prac-
tice guidelines are publicly available at:
http://www.anaes.fr or http://affsaps.sante

English and other languages; the GEM DTD is

3 Processing Steps
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999627666666667">
Segmenting a guideline to fill an XML template is
a complex process involving several steps. We de-
scribe here in detail the most important steps
(mainly the way the scope of conditional sequences
is computed), and will only give a brief overview
of the pre-processing stages.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987633">
3.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964272727273">
A manual study of several French practice guide-
lines revealed a number of trends in the data. We
observed that there is a default structure in these
guidelines that may help segmenting the text accu-
rately. This default segmentation corresponds to a
highly conventionalized writing style used in the
document (a norm). For example, the location of
conditions is especially important: if a condition
occurs at the opening of a sequence (a paragraph, a
section...), its scope is by default the entire follow-
ing text sequence. If the condition is included in the
sequence (inside a sentence), its default scope is
restricted to the current sentence (Charolles, 2 005
for similar observations on different text types).
This default segmentation can be revised if some
linguistic cues suggest another more accurate seg-
mentation (violation of the norm). We make use of
Halliday&apos;s theory of text cohesion (Halliday and
Hasan, 1976). According to this theory, some &amp;quot;co-
hesion cues&amp;quot; suggest extending the default segmen-
tation while some others suggest limiting the scope
of the conditional sequence (see section 3.4).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999568">
3.2 Pre-processing (Cue Identification)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999465">
The pre-processing stage concerns the analysis of
relevant linguistic cues. These cues vary in nature:
they can be based either on the material structure or
the content of texts. We chose to mainly focus on
task-independent knowledge so that the method is
portable, as far as possible (we took inspiration
from Halliday and Matthiessen&apos;s introduction to
functional grammar, 2 004). Some of these cues
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9887846875">
(especially connectors and lexical cues) can be
automatically captured by machine learning meth-
ods.
Material structure cues. These features include the
recognition of titles, section, enumerations and
paragraphs.
Morpho-syntactic cues. Recommendations are not
expressed in the same way as conditions from a
morpho-syntactic point of view. We take the fol-
lowing features into account:
− Part of speech tags. For example recommande
should be a verb and not a noun, even if the
form is ambiguous in French;
− Tense and mood of the verb. Present and future
tenses are relevant, as well as imperative and
conditional moods. Imperative and future al-
ways have an injunctive value in the texts. In-
junctive verbs (see lexical cues) lose their in-
junctive property when used in a past tense.
Anaphoric cues. A basic and local analysis of ana-
phoric elements is performed. We especially fo-
cused on expressions such as dans ce cas, dans les
N cas precedents (in this case, in the n preceding
cases...) which are very frequent in clinical docu-
ments. The recognition of such expressions is
based on a limited set of possible nouns that oc-
curred in context, together with specific constraints
(use of demonstrative pronouns, etc).
Conjunctive cues (discourse connectors). Condi-
tions are mainly expressed through conjunctive
cues. The following forms are especially interest-
ing: forms prototypically expressing conditions (si,
en cas de, dans le cas oii... if, in case of...); Forms
expressing the locations of some elements (chez, en
presence de... in presence of...); Forms expressing
a temporal frame (lorsque, au moment oii, avant
de... when, before...)
Lexical cues. Recommendations are mainly ex-
pressed through lexical cues. We have observed
forms prototypically expressing recommendations
(recommander, prescrire, ... recommend, pre-
scribe), obligations (devoir, ... shall) or options
(pouvoir, ... can). Most of these forms are highly
ambiguous but can be automatically acquired from
an annotated corpus. Some expressions from the
medical domains can be automatically extracted
using a terminology extractor (we use Yatea, see
section 4, &amp;quot;Implementation&amp;quot;).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998763">
3.3 Basic Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99987705">
A basic segment corresponds to a text sequence
expressing either a condition or a recommendation.
It is most of the time a sentence, or a proposition
inside a sentence.
Some of the features described in the previous
section may be highly ambiguous. For this reason
basic segmentation is rarely done according to a
single feature, but most of the time according to a
bundle of features acquired from a representative
corpus. For example, if a text sequence contains an
injunctive verb with an infinitive form at the begin-
ning of a sentence, the whole sequence is typed as
action. The relevant sets of co-occurring features
are automatically derived from a set of annotated
practice guidelines, using the chi-square test to cal-
culate the dissimilarity of distributions.
After this step, the text is segmented into typed
basic sequences expressing either a recommenda-
tion or a condition (the rest of the text is left
untagged).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998758">
3.4 Computing Frames and Scopes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985857142857">
As for quantifiers, a conditional element may have
a scope (a frame) that extends over several basic
segments. It has been shown by several authors
(Halliday and Matthiessen, 2 004; Charolles, 2 005)
working on different types of texts that conditions
detached from the sentence have most of the time a
scope beyond the current sentence whereas condi-
tions included in a sentence (but not in the begin-
ning of a sentence) have a scope which is limited to
the current sentence. Accordingly we propose a
two-step strategy: 1) the default segmentation is
done, and 2) a revision process is used to correct
the main errors caused by the default segmentation
(corresponding to the norm).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.936709">
Default Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999585">
We propose a strategy which makes use of the no-
tion of default. By default:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9926313">
1. Scope of a heading goes up to the next head-
ing;
2. Scope of an enumeration&apos;s header covers all
the items of the enumeration;
3. If a conditional sequence is detached (in the
beginning of a paragraph or a sentence), its
scope is the whole paragraph;
4. If the conditional sequence is included in a
sentence, its scope is equal to the current
sentence.

<bodyText confidence="0.999626833333333">
Cases 3 and 4 cover 5 0-8 0% of all the cases, de-
pending on the practice guidelines used. However,
this default segmentation is revised and modified
when a linguistic cue is a continuation mark within
the text or when the default segmentation seems to
contradict some cohesion cue.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.741844">
Revising the Default Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999615">
There are two cases which require revising the de-
fault segmentation: 1) when a cohesion mark indi-
cates that the scope is larger than the default unit;
2) when a rupture mark indicates that the scope is
smaller. We only have room for two examples,
which, we hope, give a broad idea of this process.

coherence: they usually indicate the continuation of
a frame after the end of its default boundaries.

In Figure 2, the expression dans les deux cas (in
the two cases...) is an anaphoric mark referring to
the two previous utterances. The scope of the con-
ditional segment introduced by lorsque (that would
normally be limited to the sentence it appears in) is
thus extended accordingly.
2) Other discourse cues are strong indicators
that a frame must be closed before its default
boundaries. These cues may indicate some contras-
tive, corrective or adversative information (cepen-
dant, en revanche... however). Justifications cues
(en effet, en fait ... in effect) also pertain to this
class since a justification is not part of the action
element of the GEM DTD.

4 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999619785714286">
Accurate discourse processing requires a lot of in-
formation ranging from lexical cues to complex co-
occurrence of different features. We chose to im-
plement these in a classic blackboard architecture
(Englemore and Morgan, 1988). The advantages of
this architecture for our problem are easy to grasp:
each linguistic phenomenon can be treated as an
independent agent; inference rules can also be
coded as specific agents, and a facilitator controls
the overall process.
Basic linguistic information is collected by a set
of modules called &amp;quot;linguistic experts&amp;quot;. Each mod-
ule is specialized in a specific phenomenon (text
structure recognition, part-of-speech tagging, term
spotting, etc.). The text structure and text format-
ting elements are recognized using Perl scripts.
Linguistic elements are encoded in local grammars,
mainly implemented as finite-state transducers
(Unitex4). Other linguistic features are obtained
using publicly available software packages, e.g. a
part-of-speech tagger (Tree Tagger5) and a term
extractor (Yatea6), etc. Each linguist expert is en-
capsulated and produces annotations that are stored
in the database of facts, expressed in Prolog (we
thus avoid the problem of overlapping XML tags,
which are frequent at this stage). These annotations
are indexed according to the textual clause they
appear in, but linear ordering of the text is not cru-

cial for further processing steps since the system
mainly looks for co-occurrences of different cues.
The resulting set of annotations constitutes the
&amp;quot;working memory&amp;quot; of the system.
Another set of experts then combine the initial
disseminated knowledge to recognize basic seg-
ments (section 3.3) and to compute scopes and
frames (section 3.4). These experts form the &amp;quot;infer-
ence engine&amp;quot; which analyzes information stored in
the working memory and adds new knowledge to
the database. Even when linear order is irrelevant
for the inference process new information is in-
dexed with textual clauses, to enable the system to
produce the original text along with annotation.
A facilitator helps to determine which expert
has the most information needed to solve the prob-
lem. It is the facilitator that controls, for example,
the application of default rules and the revision of
the default segmentation. It controls the chalk, me-
diating among experts competing to write on the
blackboard. Finally, an XML output is produced
for the document, corresponding to a candidate
GEM version of the document (no XML tags over-
lap in the output since we produce an instance of
the GEM DTD; all potential remaining conflicts
must have been solved by the supervisor). To
achieve optimal accuracy this output is validated
and possibly modified by domain experts.

where each action has to be linked with a condi-
tion. The output can be represented as a set of cou-
ples (condition — actions). In the end, we calculate
accuracy by comparing the outputs of the two an-
notators (# of common couples).
Inter-annotator agreement is high (157 nodes out
of 162, i.e. above .96 agreement). This degree of
agreement is encouraging. It differs from previous
experiments, usually done using more heterogene-
ous data, for example, narrative texts. Temporals
(like &amp;quot;in 1999&apos;) are known to open a frame but
most of the time this frame has no clear boundary.
Practice guidelines should lead to actions by the
doctor and the scope of conditions needs to be clear
in the text.
In our experiment, inter-annotator agreement is
high, especially considering that we required an
agreement between an expert and non-expert. We
thus make the simplified assumption that the scope
of conditions is expressed through linguistic cues
which do not require, most of the time, domain-
specific or expert knowledge. Yet the very few
cases where the annotations were in disagreement
were clearly due to a lack of domain knowledge by
the non-expert.
5.3 Evaluation of the Automatic Recognition
of Basic Sequences
The evaluation of basic segmentation gives the fol-
lowing results for the condition and the recommen-
dation sequences. In the table, P is precision; R is
recall; P&amp;R is the harmonic mean of precision and
recall (P&amp;R = (2*P*R) / (P+R), corresponding to a
F-measure with a β factor equal to 1).

Results are high for both conditions and recom-
mendations.
The benefit of domain knowledge is not evident
from overall results. However, this information is
useful for the tagging of titles corresponding to
pathologies. For example, the title Hypertension
arterielle (high arterial blood pressure) is equiva-
lent to a condition introduced by in case of� It is
thus important to recognize and tag it accurately,
since further recommendations are under the scope
of this condition. This cannot be done without do-
main-specific knowledge.
The number of titles differs significantly from
one practice guideline to another. When the num-
ber is high, the impact on the performance can be
strong. Also, when several recommendations are
dependent on the same condition, the system may
fail to recognize the whole set of recommendations.
Finally, we observed that not all conditions and
recommendations have the same importance from a
medical point of view — however, it is difficult to
quantify this in the evaluation.
5.4 Evaluation of the Automatic Recognition
of the Scope of Conditions
The scope of conditions is recognized with accu-
racy above .7 (we calculated this score using the
same method as for inter-annotator agreement, see
section 5.2).
This result is encouraging, especially consider-
ing the large number of parameters involved in dis-
course processing. In most of successful cases the
scope of a condition is recognized by the default
rule (default segmentation, see section 3.4). How-
ever, some important cases are solved due to the
detection of cohesion or boundary cue (especially
titles).
The system fails to recognize extended scopes
(beyond the default boundary) when the cohesion
marks correspond to lexical items which are related
(synonyms, hyponyms or hypernyms) or to com-
plex anaphora structures (nominal anaphora; hypo-
nyms and hypernyms can be considered as a spe-
cial case of nominal anaphora). Resolving these
rarer complex cases would require &amp;quot;deep&amp;quot; domain
knowledge which is difficult to implement using
state-of-art techniques.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992571428571">
We have presented in this paper a system capable
of performing automatic segmentation of clinical
practice guidelines. Our aim was to automatically
fill an XML DTD from textual input. The system is
able to process complex discourse structures and to
compute the scope of conditional segments span-
ning several propositions or sentences. We show
that inter-annotator agreement is high for this task
and that the system performs well compared to
previous systems. Moreover, our system is the first
one capable of resolving the scope of conditions
over several recommendations.
As we have seen, discourse processing is diffi-
cult but fundamental for intelligent information
access. We plan to apply our model to other lan-
guages and other kinds of texts in the future. The
task requires at least adapting the linguistic com-
ponents of our system (mainly the pre-processing
stage). More generally, the portability of discourse-
based systems across languages is a challenging
area for the future.

The XML template includes semantic information not explicitly encoded in the text (pairs of conditions and actions/recommendations). Therefore, there is a need to compute the exact scope of conditions over text sequences expressing the required actions. We present a system developed for this task.

We chose to implement these in a classic blackboard architecture (Englemore and Morgan, 1988). The advantages of this architecture for our problem are easy to grasp: each linguistic phenomenon can be treated as an independent agent; inference rules can also be coded as specific agents, and a facilitator controls the overall process. Basic linguistic information is collected by a set of modules called &amp;quot;linguistic experts&amp;quot;. Each module is specialized in a specific phenomenon (text structure recognition, part-of-speech tagging, term spotting, etc.). The text structure and text formatting elements are recognized using Perl scripts. Linguistic elements are encoded in local grammars, mainly</context>

Concerning the non-immuno-depressed patient / Concerning the immuno-depressed patient...) but a second condition interferes in the scope of this first level (En cas d&apos;aspect normal de la muqueuse il6- ale... If the ileal mucus seems normal...). The task involves recognizing these various levels of conditions in the text and explicitly representing them through the GEM DTD. 2 See &amp;quot;the text-forming component in the linguistic system&amp;quot; in Halliday and Hasan (1976:23). 114 Chez le sujet non immunodeprime, en cas d&apos;aspect macroscopique normal de la muqueuse colique, des biopsies coliques nombreuses et etagees sont recommandees ( ...).

For example, the location of conditions is especially important: if a condition occurs at the opening of a sequence (a paragraph, a section...), its scope is by default the entire following text sequence. If the condition is included in the sequence (inside a sentence), its default scope is restricted to the current sentence (Charolles, 2 005 for similar observations on different text types). This default segmentation can be revised if some linguistic cues suggest another more accurate segmentation (violation of the norm). We make use of Halliday&apos;s theory of text cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976). According to this theory, some &amp;quot;cohesion cues&amp;quot; suggest extending the default segmentation while some others suggest limiting the scope of the conditional sequence (see section 3.4). 3.2 Pre-processing (Cue Identification) The pre-processing stage concerns the analysis of relevant linguistic cues. These cues vary in nature: they can be based either on the material structure or the content of texts. We chose to mainly focus on task-independent knowledge so that the method is portable, as far as possible (we took inspiration from Halliday and Matthiessen&apos;s introduction to functional grammar, 2 </context>
