1 Long Sentence Analysis
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968142857143">
We propose a method for analyzing long complex
and compound sentences that utilizes global struc-
ture analysis with domain-specific pattern grammar.
Previously, long sentence analysis with global in-
formation used the following methods: two-level
analysis—global structure analysis of long sentences
with domain-independent function words and pars-
ing of their constituents[Doi et al., 1991], and pat-
tern matching—adaptation of domain-specific fixed
pattern to input sentences. By utilizing domain-
dependent information the latter method could an-
alyze long sentences of that domain. But since the
matching is made only on the surface the sentence
isn&apos;t analyzed well when patterns appear recursively.

2 Domain-Specific Pattern Grammar

Our method analyzes the global structure of long
sentences by using three knowledge-bases: domain-
specific patterns that can be described as a phrase
structure grammar, a list of keywords that denote
constituents of the patterns, and a pure basic gram-
mar. An input sentence is initially parsed and di-
vided into its constituents with these knowledge-
bases, and then each constituent is parsed with a
general grammar. Each constituent must be guaran-
teed uniformity by parsing with pure basic grammar.
To obtain a pattern grammar of Japanese long
sentences we analyzed the structures of about 750
long sentences from the leads of news articles in a
Japanese newspaper, Asahi Shinbun, and identified
several fixed global patterns. An example of pat-
tern grammar is shown in Fig. 1. Using the pattern
grammar and keyword list(a–c), the global structure
of the sentence(d) was analyzed as f).

<bodyText confidence="0.9999715">
Our method takes advantage of both two-level anal-
ysis and pattern matching, and can deal with the
irregular appearance of patterns including recursive
patterns, ellipsis of constituents and patterns that
appear in only part of the sentence.
We have developed a Japanese lead analyzing sys-
tem using a pattern grammar. We used this sys-
tem with several 80-200 word Japanese leads such as
the example sentence in Fig. 1., and obtained correct
global structures and syntactic trees for them.
