INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.983379578947368">
A problem that must be dealt with in order to build
an ITS in the domain of foreign language teaching
is that of establishing what kind of grammatical
knowledge has to be included in the Domain Expert
module. At first sight, two distinct options are
possible:
a) to utilize the knowledge contained in textbooks
and school grammars:
b) to adopt one of the formal grammars developed
by theoretical and computational linguists.
Both these solutions have their shortcomings.
Traditional grammar textbooks have serious
drawbacks which concern both their content and the
way it is presented to the student. The introduction
of the notional syllabuses and the almost general
adoption of the communicative approach have
somehow changed the general attitude and the
strategies utilized in foreign language teaching, but
even the grammars that follow these methodologies
do not overcome the most severe limitation of what
we call the naive approach to the representation of
linguistic knowledge, i.e., the incapacity to provide
a global and coherent model of language.
The formal grammars developed by linguists,
on the other hand, show their shortcomings when
we try to use them directly for didactic purposes.
The point is that these grammars have been
developed to pursue goals that are different from
those of school grammars. Theoretical linguists are
in fact interested in providing mathematically well
defined descriptions of a language which capture the
competence of a native speaker. Computational
linguists are interested in discovering
computationally effective models of the processes
that allow the speaker to utter or to understand a
sentence in that language. Considered from the
point of view of a foreign language teacher, these
formal descriptions are generally useless since the
(meta)language in which they are framed and the
concepts which they are grounded upon are different
from those utilized in daily teaching.
The relationship between formal and naive
grammars in foreign language teaching is dealt
with in this paper which presents, as a case study,
an attempt to integrate the two approaches within
an intelligent tutoring system. The work has been
carried on in the framework of the ET (English
Tutor) project whose long term goal is the
development of a tutoring system aimed at helping
Italian students master English verb tenses. Within
this project, ET-1, a prototype system based on a
naive approach to the grammar of tense (described
in Fum, Giangrandi, and Tasso, 1989), has been
built. The experimentation performed with ET-1
provided the motivation for a critical re-evaluation
and revision of some of the assumptions which the
prototype was grounded upon. The possibility of
formulating some naive intuitions into a systemic
representation of grammatical knowledge is
discussed in the paper and a new version of the
domain expert module exploiting the systemic
approach to tense selection is illustrated. The
following section presents our previous naive
approach to a grammar of English verb tense,
describes how the grammatical knowledge has been
utilized by the domain expert module of ET-1, and
clarifies why such an approach has been found in
the long run unsatisfactory. The next section
illustrates the systemic approach to tense developed
by M.A.K. Halliday (1976) and C. Matthiessen
1983, 1984). Our original contribution is then
presented and it is shown how the naive approach
has been integrated into a systemic framework. The
- 149 -
last section presents some evaluation criteria for the
present proposal.

A NAIVE APPROACH TO TENSE
SELECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998984739130435">
The basic goal pursued in constructing the domain
expert module - called Verb Generation Expert - of
ET-1 has been that of building a glass-box model
of the competence underlying the choice and
conjugation of an English verb tense. One of the
main concerns in designing the knowledge base for
this module has been that of maintaining the
wealth of ideas and intuitions existing in the naive
account of tenses while developing at the same
time a computationally tractable model of the tense
selection process.
In order to build the Verb Generation Expert
module, we started by examining the explanations
about tense usage given in a set of reference
grammars and by extracting a set of tense features
representing the ideas and concepts which were
utilized in providing such explanations. Then we
described according to these features the set of
exercises to be presented to the students.
To give a more concrete idea of what the
descriptions looked like, we report here the
(simplified and partial) representation of an
exercise:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.956380352941177">
Yesterday, when I (arrive), Tom (talk) on the
telephone.
(defexercise ex5
(text (Yesterday when I (arrive) Tom (talk) on
the telephone))
(structure ex5 (clauses (cl, c2)))
(defclause cl
(text (when I (arrive)))
(in-exercise ex5)
(open-item (arrive))
(clause-kind (subordinate temporal))
(superordinate (c2))
(clause-form affirmative)
(open-item-time-interval 11)
(fact-kind (action single))
(aspect (action completed))
(deftemporalrelations ex5
</equation>
<construct confidence="0.82230925">
(before t2 now)
(during :1 :2)
(during ti t3)
(during t3 t2)))
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.988082884057971">
Each exercise is usually constituted by one or two
clauses in which some of the verbs are given in the
infinitive form and have to be conjugated into the
appropriate tense. The exercise is described through
lists of attribute-values pairs, one for each clause.
The first member of the pair indicates a tense
feature, the second member the value the feature
receives in the clause. The exercise description
comprizes also a list of temporal relations
expressing the relationships that exist between the
time intervals mentioned in the sentence. These
time intervals are associated with the situations
(states and/or events) described by the sentence
verbs and with the temporal expressions occurring
in the sentence, and are represented through the
symbols tl .. tn. In our exercise, for example, we
find two verbs and one temporal expression,
therefore three time intervals are utilized to describe
the exercise. The time interval t/ is associated
with the state indicated by the verb to arrive, the
time interval t2 with the temporal expression
yesterday, and so on. The temporal relations
specify the relationships existing between these
intervals so, for example, (during tl t2) states that
the time interval ti is included within the interval
t2 : the verb to arrive indicates thus an action that
happens within the time interval represented by 12
(i.e., yesterday). A special time interval is
represented by the symbol now which stands for
the speaking time, i.e., the interval during which
the sentence is being uttered.
Since the number of the potential temporal
relations holding between the time intervals
contained in the sentence could be quite large, only
the relations directly derivable from the exercise
text are explicitly represented in the description. At
the beginning of its operation, the Verb Generation
Expert deduces therefore from the stated temporal
relation all the possible relations holding between
the various time intervals. In doing this, it applies
a set of inference rules that implement a reduced
version of Allen&apos;s temporal logic (Allen, 1984).
In order to be able to choose the tense for a
sentence clause containing an open item, it is
generally necessary to know not only the relation
between the time in which the sentence is uttered
and the time of the events described in the sentence,
but also the relation which holds between the event
time and the so called reference time, i.e., the
interval of time the situation described in the clause
refers to. So, for example, in the sentence:
By the end of next month I shall have finished my
thesis.
the speaking time is now, the event time is given
by the time interval associated with the action to
finish the thesis and the reference time is
constituted by the time interval indicated with by
the end of next month.
In some clauses the reference time may be
absent and, in such cases, the only temporal
relationship involved in the choice of the tense is
that which holds between the speaking time and the
event time.
In the following operation step, the Verb
Generation Expert computes the reference time (if
it exists) for every exercise clause through a series
- 150 -
of production rules. In our case the following rules
applies among others:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.711579857142857">
IF the clause is a main clause,
there is a subordinate temporal clause related
to it,
the event time includes the event time of the
subordinate temporal,
THEN set the reference time to the event time of
the temporal subordinate clause.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.9571909375">
The rule asserts that the main clause c2:
Yesterday Tom (talk) on the telephone
has as its reference time 11, i.e., the time interval
represented by the event time of the subordinate
temporal c/:
when I (arrive).
Once the reference times for the exercise
clauses have been computed, it is possible to
choose the tense for each open item. To do this, a
set of tense selection rules are used. The antecedent
of these rules is constituted by some conditions
concerning the tense features that must hold in the
clause description, while the consequent indicates
the tense that has to be assigned to the open item.
In our example the following rules are utilized for
the clauses c/ and c2, respectively:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.8912831">
IF the clause describes a past event,
the reference time is past,
the event is completed
THEN use the simple past tense.
and
IF the clause describes a past event,
the reference time, if defined, is past and it is
included in the event time,
the event is not completed
THEN use the past continuous.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957374509804">
According to our rules, therefore, the tense that is
chosen for to arrive is the simple past while to
talk has to be conjugated into the past
continuous.
The last thing that needs to be done at this
point is to conjugate the verbs into the chosen
tenses. For the regular verbs a set of conjugation
rules are exploited, whereas the conjugation of the
irregular forms is performed by a simple dictionary
look up.
Leaving aside some computational
complexities deriving from the need of drawing the
logical temporal inferences and of computing the
reference time for each exercise clause, the process
performed by the Verb Generation Expert relies on
the same concepts and rules described in the naive
grammars. However, the adoption of the naive
approach has its problems as we realized by
experimenting with the prototype.
First of all, the translation of a naive grammar
into a computationally suitable form is not
straightforward. The explanations given by the
naive grammars - the &apos;tense selection rules&apos; that are
derived from the textbooks - are in fact incomplete
and even inconsistent. As a result, ET-1 was
sometimes incapable of solving a given exercise
since the rules of the grammar did not cover that
particular case. In other instances we found the
opposite to be true, i.e., we obtained multiple
incompatible solutions for the same exercise since
several rules could be legitimately applied to the
case at hand. The computational application of the
naive grammars, in other words, disclosed some
deficiencies and incongruities that went unnoticed
in the original formulation.
Second, the informal concepts used in the
naive grammars and utilized in ET-1 to express the
tense features have generally no well stated
definition. This means that it is difficult to
attribute unequivocally the value to the temporal
features describing an exercise since a lot is left to
the insight of the exercise coder. Different
implementers can thus describe the same exercise in
a different way and obtain therefore different, often
incompatible, solutions.
From the experimentation performed with the
prototype, and from an analysis of its limitations,
the need of a theoretically sound formulation of the
grammatical knowledge, keeping as far as possible
the &apos;cognitive transparency&apos; of the naive grammar,
has arisen.

THE SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO
TENSE SELECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.951901333333333">
According to the systemic approach, two
assumptions are made concerning the grammar of
the English tense. These assumptions are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9872992">
a) Tense opposition: the tense in English is
considered as a three term opposition. From a
linguistic point of view, it is an opposition of
past vs. present vs. future; from a semantic
point of view, as we will see below, it is
interpretable as a precedence relation between
two temporal variables.
b) Seriality: complex tense combinations can be
constructed by repeatedly selecting among the
three term opposition.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999668192307692">
As far as the first assumption is concerned, it
should be noted that not all the linguists agree with
the idea of English as a three-tense language. It is
sometimes claimed, in fact, that in English it is
possible to distinguish only between present and
past, the future being a modal form of the present.
The second assumption reduces the process of
tense selection to a series of iterative choices
concerning the three term option. In other words, a
tense combination like &apos;is going to have built&apos; is
chosen by picking up the first time (primary tense)
the present, then (secondary tense) the future and
finally (ternary tense) the past. The name for a
tense combination in the systemic approach is
determined by considering the inverted order of the
choices: in our case the tense combination is a past
in future in present.
An important point concerns which possible
tense combinations are allowed. It should be noted
that, according to Halliday, up to quinary tenses
(like: &apos;will have been going to have been taking&apos;:
a present in past in future in past in past) are
admissible in English. Some tense combinations,
however, are not allowed; in English, for instance,
there is no future in future in present and the
following sentence is considered ungrammatical:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.329209">
* Henry is going to be going to cook dinner
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991908666666667">
The restrictions that the English grammar puts on
the possible tense combinations are called &apos;stop
rules&apos; by Halliday and can thus be paraphrased:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94871">
1. The present can occur only at the ends of
the tense sequence (as a beginning or final
choice).
2. Except in the last and penultimate place,
the same tense cannot occur in two
consecutive positions.
3. The future can occur only once, apart from
the last position.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992204142857143">
These rules define whether a tense combination is
legitimate but they do not indicate how a given
tense combination is selected. To this end a
significant contribution has been given by
Matthiessen with his notion of chooser. To each
option concerning the tense, and represented in the
grammar through a system, Matthiessen assigns a
chooser &amp;quot;that states how the selection among the
options specified is controlled. A chooser is a
procedure that consists of steps that ascertain
conceptual distinctions and make grammatical
choices according to the conceptual distinctions.&amp;quot;
(Matthiessen, 1984, pg. 1).
According to this point of view, a verb tense
essentially indicates the temporal relation which
holds between the speaking time and the event
time, and the tense selection process is determined
by such a relation. More particularly, for each
iteration step, the choosers take into account a
relation of precedence (anteriority) - that we
symbolize through V - between two different
temporal variables (let us call them Tx and Ty)
an
- if Tx come after Ty (Ty &lt; Tx), then the past
is chosen;
- if Tx comes before Ty (Tx &lt; Ty), then the
future is chosen;
- if none of the above alternatives holds, then the
chosen tense is present.
The process, in other words, starts by setting
the time variable Tx to the speaking time Ts and
by looking for the comparison time Tc, i.e., the
time interval the speaking time is related to. This
is the time that is assigned as a value to Ty. At
this point it is possible to choose the primary tense
according to the relation which holds between Tx (=
Ts) and Ty (=Tc). If the comparison time matches
the event time Te, then the temporal relation
holding between Ts and Te has been found and the
resulting tense combination consists only of a
primary tense (a simple present or a simple past or
a simple future). If, on the other hand, the
comparison time is different from the event time,
the process cannot terminate since no temporal
relationship has been established between the
speaking time and the event time. A new iteration
cycle starts by assigning the old Tc to Tx and by
looking for a new comparison time Tc to be
assigned to Ty. The choice of the secondary tense
is made again according to the relation holding
between Tx and Ty and the process terminates if
Tc matches Te. If this is not the case, the process
goes on according to the same modalities with a
tertiary, quaternary or quinary tense, until a link
between the speaking time and the event time will
be found.

COMBINING THE NAIVE AND
SYSTEMIC APPROACHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985728540372671">
The view of grammar as a set of resources from
which to choose, and the focus on the social role of
language, are two of the reasons that support
systemic grammar as a candidate formalism for
didactic utilization. It is evident, in fact, that the
notion of choice, the concept on which such
grammars are based, is more familiar to teachers
and students than other abstract principles (e.g.,
unification) which other formalisms rely upon. The
emphasis on the functional organization of the
language - how it presents speakers with systems
of meaningful options as a basis for
communication - makes systemic grammar in
keeping with modern approaches to language
teaching. But there are other reasons that support
such a choice. Among these we mention:
the fact that the grammar of tense, the subset of
language that concerns us in the ET project, is
well documented in the systemic approach
through papers by Halliday himself (Halliday,
1976) and, from a computational point of view,
by Matthiessen (1983, 1984);
the interest shown by Halliday for the issues
related to teaching, and the fact that much of his
writing has been aimed at this topic (see, for
example, Halliday, McIntosh and Stevrens,
1964);
the fact that the systemic approach provides us
not only with a static description of linguistic
structures but, especially in the computational
application of Matthiessen, with a runnable
model of language;
the fact that it is possible to translate the
systemic approach into rigorously formal terms
(Patten and Richie, 1987) and to express it into
- 152 -
a notation that is compatible with the
formalisms, like functional unification
grammar, currently used in computational
linguistics (Kasper, 1987).
For all these reasons, the systemic approach has
been judged particularly suitable to serve as the
conceptual ground for an intelligent tutoring
system devoted to the foreign language teaching. At
the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
a (subset of) a systemic grammar has been utilized
as part of an ITS.
The most important problem that has been dealt
with in applying the systemic model to the
representation of the grammatical knowledge for the
new Verb Generation expert has been that of the
construction of the tense determination rules
(choosers) capable of establishing in a cognitively
transparent way (i.e., using as much as possible the
ideas and concepts of the naive approach) a tense
combination according to the assumptions of
seriality and opposition of the systemic approach.
Adopting these assumptions led to a complete
change of the original verb generation strategy
which was based on the direct choice, in a single
step without iteration, of the verb tense according
to a heterogeneous set of features taken into
account by the rule antecedents.
Solving the problem of tense determination
according to the systemic approach requires finding
the solution to the following subproblems:
- how to choose the tense in each iteration step;
- how to stop the iteration process.
We have examined in a previous section
Matthiessen&apos;s proposal. His procedure for choosing
the tense in each step is based on successive
comparisons between the reference and the
comparison time, while the termination procedure
is based on a match between the current comparison
time and the event time.
The burden of the whole process falls
primarily on the identification, in each iteration
step, of the appropriate comparison time, and this
is performed through a dialogue between the
choosers and an environment representing the
semantic and pragmatic factors influencing the
choice of the tense. These factors are, however,
hidden from the choosers which simply receive
from the environment the answers to their
inquiries. In other words, the choosers work by
exploiting only the temporal relations between the
different times, while the semantic and pragmatic
factors play a covert role in the identification of the
comparison time the choosers receive as input.
According to our point of view, it is possible
to make explicit the criteria underlying the
determination of the tense and build cognitively
adequate choosers that utilize them directly. In our
new approach, this is done by dividing the features
used by the tense selection rules of the naive
grammar into two classes: the first class comprizes
those features which express the temporal relation
among the time intervals occurring in the exercise
sentence; the second class comprizes the features of
morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic
information. These two classes play a different role
in determining a tense combination. More
particularly, the temporal features are utilized by a
first type of chooser which discriminates in each
iteration step between past vs. present vs. future
(selection choosers). The remaining features are
utilized by a different category of choosers whose
task is to establish whether the tense selection
process should be iterated or not (termination
choosers). Differently from Matthiessen, however,
the decision of the termination choosers is not
based on a simple matching procedure which checks
whether a link between the speaking time and the
event time has already been established.This
decision instead exploits a series of more complex
factors through which the criteria underlying the
determination of a tense combination in a given
language are made explicit.
Let us clarify this new approach, which
integrates the systemic treatment of tense with the
use of the features found in the naive grammars, by
reconsidering, as an example, the exercise
presented in a previous section:
Yesterday,when I (arrive), Tom (talk) on the
telephone.
The solution to this exercise requires the use of the
(simple) past for the first verb and the present in
past (or past continuous) for the second open item.
While in the previous version of the Verb
Generation Expert these solutions were chosen
through appropriate rules that directly established
the correct tenses, according to the systemic theory
the tense determination process is iterative. In other
words, the first tense is determined by choosing
past for the primary tense and halting the process.
The second tense is determined by choosing past as
the primary tense, iterating the selection process for
the secondary tense in which present is chosen, and
then stopping.
In order to perform such a process, both the
selection and termination choosers are needed. In
our case, the following chooser applies:
IF the clause describes a past event,
the reference time is past,
THEN set the primary tense to past.
This chooser is very similar to the naive tense
selection nile utilized to establish that a given verb
should be conjugated into the simple past: it has
been obtained, in fact, by withdrawing from that
rule the condition concerning an aspectual feature
(the event is completed). The selection choosers
work thus by exploiting only the temporal
features, and the choice among past vs. present vs.
future is performed by taking into account only the
temporal relations among the states and events
described in the sentence. This chooser allows the
identification of past as the primary tense for both
the open items of the exercise. As for the first
- 153 -
open item, after the primary tense has been
selected, a termination chooser can be applied:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.676255333333333">
IF the primary tense is past
the clause contains an explicit time
expression
the action described in the clause has been
completed
THEN stop.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.989160297297297">
The termination choosers work by exploiting
features of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and
pragmatic information. While the tense selection
choosers take into account the temporal aspects of
the tense determination process, the termination
choosers represent an interface between the tense
system of a particular language and the
relationships among the states or events described
in a sentence the speaker intends to convey through
the usage of a given tense.
In our case, the first condition determines the
applicability of the chooser (it represents one of the
termination choosers for the (simple) past), while
the remaining conditions put forward two of the
criteria that establish when the simple past
represents a necessary and sufficient tense
combination for expressing a given meaning: i.e..
when the action described in the sentence has been
completed in the past at a definite time.
No termination choosers are applicable to the
second open item which therefore resorts to a
secondary tense selection. The following selection
chooser applies:
IF the clause has a definite reference time,
the event time is equal to or includes the
reference time
THEN set the secondary tense to present.
As a result of the action performed by the chooser,
the secondary tense is set to the present. After the
secondary tense has been determined, the following,
very simple, termination chooser applies:
IF the primary tense is present,
the secondary tense is past
THEN stop.
According to the systemic grammar of English
tense, in fact, no further tenses are possible after a
combination of present in past has been chosen.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994436875">
In the paper a new approach to the problem of
determining the tense combination for an English
sentence has been proposed with integrates the
treatment of tense in a systemic grammar with the
naive approach in school grammars. The systemic
theory provides general assumptions (i.e. three-
tense opposition and seriality) which the tense
selection process relies upon, while the naive
features provide the criteria for terminating the
selection process. The integration of the naive
approach into a systemic framework can be
evaluated according to three different perspectives:
- Computational. How effective is the proposed
theory? What is its coverage? How general is
it?
- Pedagogical. Is it possible to utilize such a
theory to really teach the English verbs? How
efficient is such an approach in comparison
with the traditional one?
- Psychological. To which extent does the serial
theory of time mirror the real processes that
occur in the mind of a speaker?
The ongoing research tries to answer these
questions. A series of computational experiments
with the new Verb Generation Expert, implemented
in PROLOG on a MacH, is under way with the
goal of establishing the reliability of the proposed
approach. The construction of a new Tutor aimed at
teaching the serial theory of time is under
development. Finally, a series of psychological
experiments concerning the cognitive validity of
the systemic treatment of tense are being planned.

Two basic options are possible: (i) to use a naive or pedagogical grammar, comprising knowledge derived from textbooks and school grammars or (ii) to use one of the formal grammars developed by theoretical and computational linguists. The paper discusses the relationships between naive and formal grammars in foreign language teaching and presents, as a case study, an attempt to integrate the two approaches within ET (English Tutor), an ITS aimed at helping Italian students master English verb usage. More particularly, the paper focuses on the possibility of integrating a naive grammar into a systemic framework. The reliability of the proposed approach is currently being evaluated by means of a series of computational experiments with the Verb Generation Expert of ET.</abstract>

Since the number of the potential temporal relations holding between the time intervals contained in the sentence could be quite large, only the relations directly derivable from the exercise text are explicitly represented in the description. At the beginning of its operation, the Verb Generation Expert deduces therefore from the stated temporal relation all the possible relations holding between the various time intervals. In doing this, it applies a set of inference rules that implement a reduced version of Allen&apos;s temporal logic (Allen, 1984). In order to be able to choose the tense for a sentence clause containing an open item, it is generally necessary to know not only the relation between the time in which the sentence is uttered and the time of the events described in the sentence, but also the relation which holds between the event time and the so called reference time, i.e., the interval of time the situation described in the clause refers to. So, for example, in the sentence: By the end of next month I shall have finished my thesis. the speaking time is now, the event time is given by the time interval associated with the a</context>

The relationship between formal and naive grammars in foreign language teaching is dealt with in this paper which presents, as a case study, an attempt to integrate the two approaches within an intelligent tutoring system. The work has been carried on in the framework of the ET (English Tutor) project whose long term goal is the development of a tutoring system aimed at helping Italian students master English verb tenses. Within this project, ET-1, a prototype system based on a naive approach to the grammar of tense (described in Fum, Giangrandi, and Tasso, 1989), has been built. The experimentation performed with ET-1 provided the motivation for a critical re-evaluation and revision of some of the assumptions which the prototype was grounded upon. The possibility of formulating some naive intuitions into a systemic representation of grammatical knowledge is discussed in the paper and a new version of the domain expert module exploiting the systemic approach to tense selection is illustrated. The following section presents our previous naive approach to a grammar of English verb tense, describes how the grammatical knowledge has been utilized by the </context>

For all these reasons, the systemic approach has been judged particularly suitable to serve as the conceptual ground for an intelligent tutoring system devoted to the foreign language teaching. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a (subset of) a systemic grammar has been utilized as part of an ITS. The most important problem that has been dealt with in applying the systemic model to the representation of the grammatical knowledge for the new Verb Generation expert has been that of the construction of the tense determination rules (choosers) capable of establishing in a </context>

These rules define whether a tense combination is legitimate but they do not indicate how a given tense combination is selected. To this end a significant contribution has been given by Matthiessen with his notion of chooser. To each option concerning the tense, and represented in the grammar through a system, Matthiessen assigns a chooser &amp;quot;that states how the selection among the options specified is controlled. A chooser is a procedure that consists of steps that ascertain conceptual distinctions and make grammatical choices according to the conceptual distinctions.&amp;quot; (Matthiessen, 1984, pg. 1). According to this point of view, a verb tense essentially indicates the temporal relation which holds between the speaking time and the event time, and the tense selection process is determined by such a relation. More particularly, for each iteration step, the choosers take into account a relation of precedence (anteriority) - that we symbolize through V - between two different temporal variables (let us call them Tx and Ty) an - if Tx come after Ty (Ty &lt; Tx), then the past is chosen; - if Tx comes before Ty (Tx &lt; Ty), then the future is chosen; - if none of the above alternatives h</context>
