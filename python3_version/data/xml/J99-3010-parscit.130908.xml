Corpora are frequently used to investigate
authentic language use and a variety of large-
sample statistical procedures are currently em-
ployed and developed for this purpose. This
book provides a largely comprehensive and
succinct overview of the most commonly em-
ployed statistical procedures with their math-
ematical foundations and is thus useful for
people interested in gaining a deeper under-
standing of statistical theory and practice in
corpus linguistics.
In a clear and precise manner, the au-
thor outlines the most common univariate
and multivariate statistical procedures and
discusses sample case studies to show how
these procedures can be useful for corpus lin-
guistics. The book includes chapters on sta-
tistical foundations, factor analysis, cluster-
ing techniques, and concordancing, as well
as two chapters on information theory and
literary detective work. The author covers a
broad range of statistical techniques while
outlining the major research questions and
methodologies in corpus linguistics.
The formatting of the book facilitates an
understanding of the rather complex mate-
rial, because key terms are bolded, tables are
clearly and consistently laid out, and formu-
las are set apart from the main text using
sufficient space. The key terms are further
collected in a glossary that contains concise
definitions and is useful as a quick reference
guide and refresher. The book also includes
tables of important distributions and helpful
references to additional readings at the end
of each chapter. Moreover, each chapter con-
cludes with a number of exercises and their
solutions are listed briefly on one page in the
appendix.
There are only a few aspects of the book
that could be improved in future editions.
First, although the author provides brief syn-
theses of relevant corpus studies, he often
does not provide directions for the applica-
tion of statistical procedures beyond the con-
text of those studies. Applications of statisti-
cal procedures are frequently misunderstood
in scholarly research because the researchers
are not sufficiently informed about the un-
derlying assumptions of the procedures and
the consequences of violating them. It would
thus be helpful to readers who are not fa-
miliar with a statistical procedure to include
tables that briefly summarize its assumptions
or lists that summarize its main goals.
Second, it might be helpful to reduce
some of the elaborate and detailed descrip-
tions of computational algorithms, because
nowadays statistical work typically relies on
computers and statistical software that auto-
matically perform the salient computations.
It would be beneficial for the novice statisti-
cal researcher to be provided with more in-
formation about the interpretations of model
parameters and the main goals of each proce-
dure and be warned about common miscon-
ceptions about them. Finally, given the rela-
tive complexity of the concepts in the book,
it would be helpful to include some of the
computational steps for the exercises in the
appendix along with the solutions.
In summary, Oakes provides a compre-
hensive, principled, and mostly succinct in-
troduction to the use of statistical procedures
and their applications to investigations of large
language databanks. The book is thus a use-
ful reference guide for both corpus linguists
and those who are interested in becoming
one, but the reader of this book should be
prepared to deal with a large array of dense
material that includes numerous tables, for-
mulas, and mathematical symbols.—André

&amp;quot;This book presents a collection of writings
on the issue of focus in its broadest sense.
While commonly being considered as related
to phenomena such as presupposition and
anaphora, focusing is much more widespread,
and it is this pervasiveness that the current
collection addresses. This volume brings to-
gether theoretical, psychological, and descrip-
tive approaches to focus, at the same time
maintaining the overall interest in how these
notions apply to the larger problem of evolv-
ing some formal representation of the seman-
tic aspects of linguistic content.
