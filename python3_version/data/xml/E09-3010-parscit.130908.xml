Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999781142857143">
Often, there is a need to use the knowledge
from multiple ontologies. This is particularly
the case within the context of medical imag-
ing, where a single ontology is not enough to
provide the complementary knowledge about
anatomy, radiology and diseases that is re-
quired by the related applications. Conse-
quently, semantic integration of these differ-
ent but related types of medical knowledge
that is present in disparate domain ontologies
becomes necessary. Medical ontology align-
ment addresses this need by identifying the
semantically equivalent concepts across mul-
tiple medical ontologies. The resulting
alignments can then be used to annotate the
medical images and related patient text data.
A corresponding semantic search engine that
operates on these annotations (i.e. align-
ments) instead of simple keywords can, in
this way, deliver the clinical users a coherent
set of medical image and patient text data.

As the content of numerous ontologies in the
biomedical domain increases, so does the need
for sharing and reusing this body of knowledge.
Often, there is a need to use the knowledge from
multiple ontologies. This is particularly the case
within the context of medical imaging, where a
single ontology is not enough to support the nec-
essary heterogeneous tasks that require comple-
mentary knowledge about human anatomy, radi-
ology and diseases. Medical imaging constitutes
the context of this work, which lies within the
Theseus-MEDICO1 use case.
The Theseus-MEDICO use case has the objec-
tive of building the next generation of intelligent,
scalable, and robust search engine for the medi-

cal imaging domain. MEDICO’s proposed solu-
tion relies on ontology based semantic annotation
of the medical image contents and the related
patient data.
Semantic annotation of medical image con-
tents and patient text data allows for a mark-up
with meaningful meta-information at a higher
level of granularity that goes beyond simple
keywords. Therefore, the data which is processed
and stored in this way can be efficiently retrieved
by a corresponding search engine such as the one
envisioned in MEDICO.
The diagnostic analysis of medical images
typically concentrates around three questions (a)
what is the anatomy here? (b) what is the name
of the body part here? (c) is it normal or is it ab-
normal? Therefore, when a radiologist looks for
information, his search queries most likely con-
tain terms from various information sources that
provide this kind of knowledge.
To satisfy the radiologist’s information need,
this scattered knowledge has to be gathered and
integrated from disparate ontologies, in particular
from those about human anatomy, radiology and
diseases. Subsequently, the medical image con-
tents and the related patient data have to be anno-
tated with this information (i.e. ontology con-
cepts and relationships) rather than the single
elements from independent ontologies.
Three ontologies that address the three ques-
tions above are relevant to gather the necessary
knowledge about human anatomy, radiology and
diseases. These are the Foundational Model of
Anatomy2 (FMA), Radiology Lexicon3 (RadLex)
and the Thesaurus of the National Cancer Insti-
tute4 (NCI), respectively.

Given this context, the semantic integration of
these ontologies as knowledge sources becomes
critical. Ontology alignment addresses this re-
quirement by identifying semantically equivalent
concepts in multiple ontologies. These concepts
are then made compatible with each other
through meaningful relationships. Hence, our
goal is to identify the correspondences between
the concepts of different medical ontologies that
are relevant to the medical image contents.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In the next section we explain the motivation
behind aligning the medical ontologies. Section 3
discusses related work in ontology alignment in
general and in the biomedical domain. In section
4 we introduce our approach and explain why it
goes beyond existing methods. Here we also ex-
plain the application scenario, which exhibits
how aligned medical ontologies can contribute to
the identification of relevant clinical search que-
ries. Section 5 introduces the materials and
methods that are relevant for this work. Finally 6

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904">
The following scenario illustrates how the
alignment of medical ontologies facilitates the
integration of medical knowledge that is relevant
to medical image contents from multiple ontolo-
gies. Suppose that we want to help a radiologist,
who searches for related information about the
manifestations of a certain type of lymphoma on
a certain organ, e.g. liver, on medical images. As
discussed earlier the three types of knowledge
that serves him would be about the human anat-
omy (liver), the organ’s location in the body (e.g.
upper limb, lower limb, neighboring organs etc.)
and whether what he sees is normal or abnormal
(pathological observations, symptoms, and find-
ings about lymphoma).
Once we know what the radiologist is looking
for we can support him in his search in that we
present him an integrated view of only the liver
lymphoma relevant portions of the patient health
records (or of that patient’s record), PubMed ab-
stracts as reference resource, drug databases, ex-
perience reports from other colleagues, treatment
plans, notes of other radiologists or even discus-
sions from clinical web discussion boards.
From the NCI Thesaurus we can obtain the in-
formation that ‘liver lymphoma’ is the synonym
for ‘hepatic lymphoma’, for which holds:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6637498">
‘hepatic lymphoma’
‘disease_has_primary_anatomic_site’
‘liver’
‘hematopoietic and lymphatic system’
‘gastrointestinal system’
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981375">
With this information we can now move on to
the FMA to find out that ‘hepatic artery’ is a
part of the ‘liver’ (such that any finding that in-
dicates lymphoma at the hepatic artery would
also imply the lymphoma at the liver). RadLex
on the other hand informs that ‘liver surgery’ is a
‘treatment’ ‘procedure’. Various types of this
‘treatment’ ‘procedure’ are ‘hepatectomy’, ‘he-
patic lobectomy’, ‘hepatic segmentectomy’, ‘he-
patic subsegmentectomy’, ‘hepatic trisegmentec-
tomy’ or ‘hepatic wedge excision’, which can be
used for disease treatment.
Consequently, the radiologist who searches for
information about liver lymphoma is presented
with a set of patient health records, PubMed ab-
stracts, radiology images etc. that are annotated
using the terminology above. In this way, the
radiologist’s search space is reduced to a signifi-
cantly small portion of the overdose of informa-
tion available in multiple data stores. Moreover,
he receives coherent data, i.e. images and patient
text data that are related to each other, from a
single access point without having to login to
several different data stores at different locations.

Ontology alignment is commonly understood as
a special case of semantic integration that con-
cerns the semi-automatic discovery of semanti-
cally equivalent concepts (sometimes also rela-
tions) across two or more ontologies.
There are two commonly adopted approaches
to ontology alignment; schema-based and in-
stance-based, where most systems use both. Ac-
cordingly, the input of the former approach is the
ontology schema only, whereas the input of the
latter is the instance data i.e. the data that have
been annotated with the ontology schema. Both
approaches take advantage of linguistic and
graph-based methods to help identify the corre-
spondences. The most recent and comprehensive
overview of work ontology alignment in general
is reported by Euzenat and Shvaiko (2007).
Ontology alignment is an increasingly active
research field in the biomedical domain, espe-
cially in association with the Open Biomedical

Ontologies (OBO)5 framework. The OBO con-
sortium establishes a set of principles to which
the biomedical ontologies shall conform to for
purposes of interoperability. The OBO confor-
mant ontologies, such as the FMA, are available
at the National Center for Biomedical Ontology
(NCBO) BioPortal6.
Johnson et al. (2006) take an information re-
trieval approach to discover relationships be-
tween the Gene Ontology (GO) and three other
OBO ontologies (ChEBI7, Cell Type8 and
BRENDA Tissue9). Here, GO ontology concepts
are treated as documents, they are indexed using
Lucene10 and are matched against the search que-
ries, which are the concepts from the other three
ontologies. Whenever a match is found, it is
taken as an evidence of a correspondence. This
approach is efficient and easy to implement and
can therefore be successful with large medical
ontologies. However, it does not account for the
complex linguistic structure typically observed at
the concept labels of the medical ontologies,
which may result in inaccurate matches.
The focus of the work reported by Zhang et al.
(2004) is to compare two different alignment
approaches that are applied to two different on-
tologies about human anatomy. The subject on-
tologies are the FMA and the Generalized Archi-
tecture for Languages, Encyclopedias and No-
menclatures for Medicine11 (GALEN). Both ap-
proaches use a combination of lexical and struc-
tural matching techniques, however one of them
additionally employs an external resource (the
Unified Medical Lexicon UMLS12) to obtain
domain knowledge. In this work the authors
point to the fact that medical ontologies contain
implicit relationships, especially in the multi-
word concept names that can be exploited to dis-
cover more correspondences. This thesis builds
on this finding and investigates further methods,
e.g. the use of transformation grammars, to dis-
cover the implicit information observed at con-
cept labels of the medical ontologies.
On the medical imaging side, there are activi-
ties that concentrate around ImageClef13 cam-
paign, which concerns the cross-language image

Drawing upon our experiences with the medical
ontologies along the MEDICO use case we have
identified some of their common characteristics
that are relevant for the alignment process. These
can be summarized as:

<listItem confidence="0.998816583333333">
1. Generally, they are very large models.

3. They have complex relationships, where
classes are connected by a number of
different relations.
4. Their terminologies are rather stable (es-
pecially for anatomy) in that they should
not differ much in the different models.

well defined and documented.

rived the following requirements specifically for
aligning medical ontologies:
Linguistic processing: Medical ontologies are
typically linguistically rich. For example, the
FMA contains concept names as long as ‘Anas-
tomotic branch of right anterior inferior cerebel-
lar artery with right superior cerebellar artery’.
Such long multi-word terms are usually rich with
implicit semantic relations. This characteristic
shall be exploited by an intensive use of linguis-
tic alignment methods.
Use of external resources: As we are in a
specific domain (medicine) and as we are not
domain experts, we are in lack of domain knowl-
edge. This missing domain knowledge shall be
acquired from external resources, for example
UMLS. Synonymy information in this resource
and in other terminological resources is of par-
ticular interest.
Non-machine learning approach: We do not
have access to much instance data. This is partly
because we are domain dependent. A more im-
portant reason, however, is that the special re-
source, the patient health records, which would
provide a large amount of relevant instance data
is very difficult to obtain due to legal issues.
Therefore, machine learning approaches, which
require large portions of training data are not the
optimal approach for our purposes.
Structural matching: Medical ontologies
typically come with rich structures that go be-
yond the basic is-a hierarchy. Most of them in-
clude a hierarchical ordering along the part-of
hierarchies. Ontologies such as FMA addition-
ally have part-of classification with higher granu-
larity that include relations such as ‘constitu-
tional part-of’, ‘systemic part-of’ etc. This rich
structure of the medical ontologies shall be used
to validate (or improve) the alignments that have
been obtained as a result of the linguistic proc-
essing and the lexical matching.
Sequential matching: Medical ontologies are
complex, so that their automatic processing is
usually expensive. Therefore, a target concept
will be identified (this target concept/term will
be in practice the search query of the clinician.
More details are explained under section 6.2)
First lexical matching techniques shall be applied
to identify the search query relevant parts of the
ontologies. In other words, those concepts that
lexically match the query shall be aligned as
first. In this way, the lexical match acts as a filter
on the medical ontology and decreases the
amount of the computation necessary.

4.2 Assumptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988965">
Given this context, we focus on the evaluation of
the following hypotheses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9827858">
1. Valid relationships (equivalence or
other) exist between concepts from
FMA, RadLex and from NCI.
2. Relationships between non-identical
concept labels from the three ontologies
can be discovered if these have common
reference in a more general medical on-
tology.
3. Concept labels in these ontologies are
most often in the form of long natural
language phrases with regular grammars.
Meaningful relationships (e.g. synon-
ymy) across the three ontologies can be
derived by processing these labels using
transformation grammars.
4. Identification of medical image related
query patterns (i.e. a certain combination
of concept labels and relations) from cor-
pora is more efficient when it is done
based on the alignments.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993929">
4.3 Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998741692307692">
The ontology alignment approach proposed in
this thesis has three main aspects. It suggests a
combinatory strategy that is based on (a) the lin-
guistic analysis of the ontology concept labels
(the linguistic aspect), (b) on corpus analysis
(context information aspect) and (c) on human-
computer interaction e.g. relevance feedback
(user interaction aspect).
The linguistic aspect draws on the observation
that concept labels in medical ontologies (espe-
cially those about human anatomy) often contain
implicit semantic relations as discussed by Mun-
gall (2004), e.g. equivalence. By observing com-
mon patterns in the multi-word terms that are
typical for the concept labels of the medical on-
tologies these relations can be made explicit.
Transformation grammars can help here to de-
tect the syntactic variants of the ontology con-
cept labels. In other words, with the help of rules,
the concept labels can be transformed into se-
mantically equivalent but syntactically different
word forms. For example, one concept label
from the FMA and its corresponding commonly
observed pattern (in brackets) is:
‘Blood in aorta’ (noun preposition noun)
Using a transformation rule of the form,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.86242">
82
</page>
<equation confidence="0.74516">
noun1 preposition:’in’ noun2 =&gt; noun2 noun1
we can generate a variant as below with the
equivalent semantics:
‘aorta blood’ (noun noun)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998260675">
This is profitable for at least two reasons.
Firstly, it can help resolve possible semantic am-
biguities (if one variant is ambiguous the other
one can be preferred). Secondly, identified vari-
ants can be used to compare linguistic (textual)
contexts of ontology concepts in corpora leading
to the second aspect of our approach.
Subsequently, the second aspect, the corpus
analysis, builds on comparing linguistic (textual)
contexts of ontology concepts in corpora and it
assumes that concepts with similar meaning
(originating from different ontologies) will ap-
pear in similar linguistic contexts. Here, the lin-
guistic context of an ontology class (e.g. ‘termi-
nal ileum’ from the FMA as in the example be-
low) can be defined as the document in which it
appears, the sentence in which it appears and a
window of size N in which it appears. For exam-
ple, a window size -5, +5 for the FMA concept
“terminal ileum” would be:
‘Focal lymphoid hyperplasia of the terminal
ileum presenting mantle zone hyperplasia with
clear cytoplasm’
can be represented as a vector in form of:
&lt;token -5, token -4, ... , token +4, token +5&gt;
&lt;focal, lymphoid, hyperplasia, of, the, present-
ing, mantle, zone, hyperplasia, with&gt;
These vectors can then be pairwise compared,
where most similar vectors indicate similar
meaning of corresponding ontology concepts and
alignment between ontology concepts follows
from this.
Finally, with the user interaction aspect we
understand dynamic models of the ontology inte-
gration process. Within this dynamic process the
ontology alignment happens during an interac-
tive dialogue between the user and the system. In
this way, clarifications and questions that elicit
user’s feedback support the ontology alignment
process. An example interactive dialogue can be:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997614066666667">
(1) Radiologist: Show me the images of Ms.
Jane Doe, she has “Amyotrophic Lateral Sclero-
sis” (NCI Cancer Thesaurus concept)
(2) System: Ms. Doe doesn’t have any images
of “Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis”. Is it equiva-
lent to “Lou Gehrig Disease” (equivalent NCI
Cancer Thesaurus concept) or to “ALS” (equiva-
lent RadLex concept)? That attacks the neurons
i.e. the nerve cells (FMA concept) Stephan Haw-
kins has it.
(3) Radiologist: Yes, that is true.
(4) System Ok. ALS is a kind of “Neuro De-
generative Disorder” (super-concept from
RadLex) Do you want to see other images on
Neuro Degenerative Disorders?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.684744">
This dialogue illustrates a real life question
answering dialogue; where the utterances (2) and
(4) contain the system questions, and utterance
(3) is the user’s interactive mapping feedback.
This aspect is based on the approach explained in
more detail in (Sonntag, 2008).

Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) is the
most comprehensive machine processable re-
source on human anatomy. It covers 71,202 dis-
tinct anatomical concepts and more than 1.5 mil-
lion relations instances from 170 relation types.
The FMA can be accessed via the Foundational
Model Explorer15.
FMA also provides synonym information (up
to 6 per concept), for example one synonym for
‘Neuraxis’ is the ‘Central nervous system’. Be-
cause single inheritance is one of the modeling
principles used in the FMA, every concept (ex-
cept for the root) stands in a unique is-a relation
to other concepts. Additionally, concepts are
connected by seven kinds of part-of relationships
(e.g., part of, constitutional part of, regional part
of). The version we currently refer to is the ver-
sion available in August 2008.
The Radiology Lexicon (RadLex) is a con-

the Radiological Society of North America
(RSNA) for the purpose of uniform indexing and
retrieval of radiology information, including im-
ages. RadLex contains 11962 terms related to
anatomy pathology, imaging techniques, and di-
agnostic image qualities. RadLex terms are or-

hierarchies. Each term will participate in one of
the relationships with its parent. Synonym in-

in ‘Schatzki ring’ and ‘lower esophageal muco-
sal ring’. Examples of radiology specific rela-
tionships are ‘thickness of projected image’ or
‘radiation dose’.
The National Cancer Institute Thesaurus
(NCI) provides standard vocabularies for cancer
research. It covers around 34.000 concepts from
which 10521 are related to Disease, Abnormal-
ity, Finding, 5901 are related to Neoplasm, 4320
to Anatomy and the rest are related to various
other categories such as Gene, Protein, etc. The
ontology model is structured around three com-
ponents i.e. Concepts, Kinds and Roles. Con-
cepts are represented as nodes in an acyclic
graph, Roles are directed edges between the
nodes and they represent the relationships be-
tween them. Kinds on the other hand are disjoint
sets of concepts and they constrain the domain
and the range of the relationships. Each concept
belongs to only one Kind. Except for the root
concept, every other concept has at least one is-a
relationship to another concept.
Every concept has one preferred name (e.g.,
‘Hodgkin Lymphoma’). Additionally, 1,207 con-
cepts have a total of 2,371 synonyms (e.g.,
Hodgkin Lymphoma has synonym ‘Hodgkin’s
Lymphoma’, ‘Hodgkin’s disease’ and ‘Hodgkin’s
Disease’). The version we currently refer to is

The PubMed lymphoma corpus is set up to
target the specific domain knowledge about lym-
phoma, a special type of cancer (one major use
case of MEDICO is lymphoma). Thus, the lym-
phoma relevant subterminology from the NCI
Thesaurus was extracted. This subterminology
includes information about lymphoma types,
their relevant thesaurus codes, synonyms, hy-
peronyms (or parent terms) and the correspond-
ing thesaurus definitions.
Using the lymphoma terminology, we identi-
fied from PubMed an initial set of most fre-
quently reported lymphomas, e.g. the top five is
‘Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma’, ‘Burkitt’s Lym-
phoma’, ‘T-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma’,
‘Follicular Lymphoma’, and ‘Hodgkin’s Lym-
phoma’ in that order. The lymphoma corpus cur-
rently consists of XML files about two main
lymphoma types i.e. ‘Mantle Cell Lymphoma’
and for ‘Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma’. The
former includes 1721 files and the latter 111.
The clinical questions corpus consists of
health related questions asked among the medical
experts and that were collected during a scien-
tific survey. These questions (without answers)
are available through the Clinical Questions Col-

searched or browsed, for example, by a specific
disease category. An example question from the
Clinical Questions Collection is “What drugs are
folic acid antagonists?” For each question, addi-

To create the clinical questions corpus we
downloaded the categories Neoplasms as well as
Menic and Lymphatic Diseases from the Clinical
Questions Collection website. For each existing
HTML page that reports on a question, we cre-
ated a corresponding XML file. Currently there
are 796 questions our questions corpus.
The clinical discussions corpus is ongoing
work and it will be a corpus, whose contents will
be compiled from the various clinical discussion
boards across the Web. These discussion boards
usually contain questions and answers between
and among the medical experts and patients. We
expect the language to be less technical because
of the user profile. The purpose of this corpus is
to have a resource of clinical questions together

wide cross-section of current British English.

6 Evaluation Strategies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934869565217">
We distinguish between two kinds of evaluation
techniques that can be applied to assess the qual-
ity of the alignments.
Direct evaluation methods compare the results
relative to human judgments as explained by
Pedersen et al. (2007), which in our case would
be the assessment and the resulting feedback of
the clinical experts. This kind of evaluation,
however, is not very realistic in our context due
to the unavailability of a representative number
of clinical experts.
Indirect evaluation methods, on the other
hand, consider the performance of an application
that uses the alignments. Hence, any improve-
ment in the performance of the application when
it uses the alignments can be attributed to the
quality of the alignments. In the following two
subsections we first describe the baseline and
then explain the planned application that shall
use the alignments. The performance of this ap-
plication, with and without the alignments, will
be taken as a measure on the quality of these
alignments.

6.1 Baseline and Comparison to Other Sys-
tems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97816395">
Our baseline for comparison is string matching
after normalization on the concept labels from
the input ontologies. Survey results (van Hage
and Aleksovski, 2007) suggest that this method
is currently the simplest and the most intuitive
method being used for ontology alignment (or
similar) tasks. Thus, the results of our matching
approach will be in the first place compared with
the results of this simple matching strategy.
The Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initia-
tive21 (OAEI) offers a service evaluate the
alignment results for its participant matching sys-
tems. The competing systems are evaluated on
consensus test cases at four different tracks. The
evaluation at the anatomy track, which is the
most relevant one for us, has been done either by
comparing the systems’ resulting alignments to
reference alignments (absolute comparison) or to
each other (relative comparison).

6.2 Clinical Query Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792285714286">
We conceive of the clinical query extraction
process as a use case that shows the benefits of
semantic integration by means of ontology align-
ments.
Clinical query extraction, (Oezden Wenner-
berg et al., 2008; Buitelaar et al., 2008) is the
process of predicting patterns for typical clinical
queries given domain ontologies and corpora. It
is motivated by the fact that when developing
search systems for healthcare professionals, it is
necessary to know what kind of information they
search for in their daily working tasks. As inter-
views with clinicians are not always possible,
alternative solutions become necessary to obtain
this information.
Clinical query extraction is a technique to
semi-automatically predict possible clinical que-
ries without having to depend on clinical inter-
views. It requires domain corpora (i.e. disease,
anatomy and radiology) and domain ontologies
to be able to process statistically most relevant
concepts in the ontologies and the relations that
hold between them. Consequently, concept-
relation-concept triplets are identified, for which
the assumption is that the statistically most rele-
vant triplets are more likely to occur in clinical
queries.
Clinical query extraction can be viewed as a
special case of term/relation extraction. Related
approaches from the medical domain are re-
ported by Bourigault and Jacquemin (1999) and
Le Moigno et al. (2002).
The identification of query patterns (i.e. the
concept-relation-concept triplets) starts with the
construction of domain corpora from related
Web resources such as Wikipedia22 and Pub-
Med23. As next, use case relevant parts from do-
main ontologies are extracted. The frequency of
the concepts from the extracted sub-ontologies in
the domain corpora versus the frequencies in a
domain independent corpus determines the do-
main specificity of the concepts.
This statistical term/concept profiling can be
viewed as a function that takes the domain
(sub)ontologies and the corpora as input and re-
turns the partially weighted domain ontologies as
output, where the terms/concepts are ranked ac-
cording to their weights. An example query pat-
tern can look like:

<bodyText confidence="0.998952533333333">
The clinical query extraction approach, as il-
lustrated so far, builds on using domain ontolo-
gies, however on using them independently. That
is, the entire statistical term profiling is based on
processing the use case relevant terms (i.e. con-
cepts) of the ontologies in isolation. In this re-
spect the clinical query pattern extraction is a
good potential application that can be used to
evaluate the quality of the ontology alignments.
As the current process is based on single con-
cepts, the natural extension will be to perform
the extraction based on aligned concepts. Any
improvement in the identification of the query
patterns from corpora can then be attributed to
the quality alignments.

7 Future Directions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960166666667">
Regarding the linguistic aspect of the ontology
alignment approach, the next step will be to con-
centrate on the definition of the transformation
grammar to generate the semantic equivalent
concepts.
A further consideration is to explore whether
other relations beyond synonymy such as hy-
ponymy or hyperonymy can also be generated
and whether this is profitable. To accord for the
second aspect, the most suitable vector model
will be determined and tested and applied on the
current corpora. As required by the third, user
interaction aspect, a dialogue that is most repre-
sentative of a real life use case will be modeled.
Currently, some of the existing alignment
frameworks, e.g. COMA++24 or PhaseLibs25 are
being tested for their performance with FMA,
RadLex and NCI. The observations on the
strengths and the weaknesses of these systems
will give more insights for the requirements for
our system.
Other tasks that are relevant for achieving the
goal of this thesis concentrate on two main top-
ics; the collection and the preparation of data and

the evaluation of the alignment approach. Subse-
quently, the clinical questions corpus will be ex-
panded and will be used to evaluate the clinical
query patterns. As explained earlier, the efficient
identification of the clinical query patterns based
on the alignments will be regarded as one means
to assess the performance of the alignment ap-
proach. Parallels, a complementary corpus com-
piled from relevant clinical discussion boards
will be prepared for the same purpose.
As required by the linguistic aspect of our ap-
proach an initial grammar will be set up and be
continuously improved to detect the variants of
the ontology concepts labels from the three on-
tologies mentioned earlier. Transformation rules
will be used for this purpose.
The open question about whether the ontology
relations shall also be aligned will be investi-
gated to determine the trade-offs of including vs.
excluding them from the process. We consider
using an external resource such as UMLS to ob-
tain background knowledge that can help resolve
possible semantic ambiguities. The appropriate-
ness and adoptability of this resource will be as-
sessed. Finally, the evaluation the overall ontol-
ogy alignment approach will be carried out,
whereby a possible participation the OAEI may
also be considered.

This is particularly the case within the context of medical imaging, where a single ontology is not enough to provide the complementary knowledge about anatomy, radiology and diseases that is required by the related applications. Consequently, semantic integration of these different but related types of medical knowledge that is present in disparate domain ontologies becomes necessary. Medical ontology alignment addresses this need by identifying the semantically equivalent concepts across multiple medical ontologies. The resulting alignments can then be used to annotate the medical images and related patient text data. A corresponding semantic search engine that operates on these annotations (i.e. alignments) instead of simple keywords can, in this way, deliver the clinical users a coherent of medical image and patient text</abstract>

It suggests a combinatory strategy that is based on (a) the linguistic analysis of the ontology concept labels (the linguistic aspect), (b) on corpus analysis (context information aspect) and (c) on humancomputer interaction e.g. relevance feedback (user interaction aspect). The linguistic aspect draws on the observation that concept labels in medical ontologies (especially those about human anatomy) often contain implicit semantic relations as discussed by Mungall (2004), e.g. equivalence. By observing common patterns in the multi-word terms that are typical for the concept labels of the medical ontologies these relations can be made explicit. Transformation grammars can help here to detect the syntactic variants of the ontology concept labels. In other words, with the help of rules, the concept labels can be transformed into semantically equivalent but syntactically different word forms. For example, one concept label from the FMA and its corresponding commonly observed pattern (in brackets) is: ‘Blood in aorta’ (noun preposition noun) Using a transformation</context>

Because single inheritance is one of the modeling principles used in the FMA, every concept (except for the root) stands in</context>

Here, GO ontology concepts are treated as documents, they are indexed using Lucene10 and are matched against the search queries, which are the concepts from the other three ontologies. Whenever a match is found, it is taken as an evidence of a correspondence. This approach is efficient and easy to implement and can therefore be successful with large medical ontologies. However, it does not account for the complex linguistic structure typically observed at the concept labels of the medical ontologies, which may result in inaccurate matches. The focus of the work reported by Zhang et al. (2004) is to compare two different alignment approaches that are applied to two different ontologies about human anatomy. The subject ontologies are the FMA and the Generalized Architecture for Languages, Encyclopedias and Nomenclatures for Medicine11 (GALEN). Both approaches use a combination of lexical and structural matching techniques, however one of them additionally employs an external resource (the Unified Medical Lexicon UMLS12) to obtain domain knowledge. In this work the authors point to the fact that medical ontologies contain implicit relationships, especially in the multiword concept na</context>
