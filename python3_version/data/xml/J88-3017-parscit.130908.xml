even inconsistencies(!), among the different authors.
Anthologies, in a discipline such as philosophy of
language, are better in that they (usually) contain pri-
mary sources. My own preference when teaching phi-
losophy of language is not to use a single-author text
(except at most to supplement the primary sources and
to serve as a guide to the problems and the literature, for
the student who prefers such a guide). Rather, I have
the students read original sources, while I provide back-
ground, connecting material, and explications in lectures.
To sum up, as a &amp;quot;single&amp;quot;-author text, Devitt and
Sterelny&apos;s book is probably better than Martin&apos;s, but
the appropriate audience for it (advanced undergradu-
ates at the very least, graduate students (or beyond) at
best) could do as well with an anthology. It would
certainly serve as an excellent, if somewhat idiosyn-
cratic, supplement to an anthology. Martin&apos;s book
would be better for (primarily undergraduate) students
who need the security of a single-author text, but the
instructor would need to correct the errors along the
way. It could, in any case, be usefully supplemented by
an anthology of primary sources.

Natural Language Generation is a collection of papers
that were presented at the Third International Work-
shop on Natural Language Generation in Nijmegen, The
Netherlands, on August 19-23, 1986. Instead of a soft-
cover proceedings, the workshop contents are captured
in this hardcover book containing edited versions of the
papers. The contributions are from computational lin-
guistics, linguistics, and psychology. In the preface,
Kempen, the editor, states that the interactions among
workshop participants demonstrated how much these
different disciplines share. Unfortunately, the interac-
tions do not appear to be reflected in the edited versions
of the papers, even though they might have been of
interest to non-attendees.
Language generation research has been viewed as
the poorer cousin of work on language understanding.
This has been true of computational work as well as
psychological research. People sometimes claim that
until computers have something to talk about, language
generation is not worth studying. Or, they assert that
language understanding is much &apos;harder&apos;, so is more
deserving of attention. This book presents the work of
researchers who have ignored such pronouncements,
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 113
Book Reviews Natural Language Generation
and who have been worrying about a variety of hard
problems concerning &apos;what to say and how to say it&apos; for
some time. Those concerned with computational mod-
eling have looked for any information that could be
expressed in language. And they&apos;ve found it, in data
bases, tic-tac-toe games, stock market reports, primary
election reports, visual scenes, newspaper reports, en-
cyclopedic knowledge, and many other places.
Language generation is becoming especially popular
because of the increase in interest in explanation for
intelligent systems. People are creating knowledge
bases that can support explanations of reasoning and
examining how explanations should proceed and get
translated into natural language. But work on natural
language generation is not focused exclusively on ex-
planation, as this book shows. The papers here are
organized under six headings: pragmatic aspects, gen-
eration of connected discourse, generator design, gram-
mars and grammatical formalisms, stages of human
sentence production, and aspects of lexicalization.
The book contains descriptions of some state-of-the-
art work on language generation. It is probably not
suitable for someone unfamiliar with problems in natu-
ral language processing or linguistics, because the con-
tributions are quite varied. Better sources for introduc-
tory material are Cullingford (1986), McKeown (1985),
and Grishman (1986). A few of the contributions are too
specific and detailed, a few very general and vague.
Some report computational work, others do not. Some
address very general issues that are of importance and
interest to all natural language researchers (such as the
contributions on pragmatic representations, levels of
processing, and systemic grammar formalizations), but
others address very narrow issues (such as generating
answers from linguistically coded data bases). How-
ever, the book is a good source of some important work,
including contributions from European researchers that
might be hard to find elsewhere.
Because of the length of the book (29 papers on 29
different topics), I will mention only a few from each
section. My selections are not representative of the
book as a whole, of course, but will give a flavor of the
type of contributions. I chose well-written papers that
present contributions of general interest. My overall
impression of the book is that publishing it as a soft-
cover proceedings would have been more suitable,
because of the wide variations in content and quality.
The first section, on pragmatic aspects, begins with
Eduard Hovy&apos;s excellent work on introducing prag-
matic information, such as affect and speaker-hearer
relationship, into a computational model of generation.
His idea is to link pragmatic goals with syntactic real-
izations through rhetorical goals, such as verbosity,
formality, and haste. An important result of his work is
his description of how rhetorical goals are used to affect
five points in the generation process: topic collection,
topic organization, sentence organization, clause con-
tent, and lexicalization. This paper gives a good over-
view and several examples of his work.
Kathleen McCoy&apos;s paper on responding to miscon-
ceptions presents a succinct overview of her system and
its treatment of the classification and response to a
user&apos;s misconceptions. She describes how the decision
of whether to respond, the general way to respond, and
the specifics of what to say in the response, are affected
by a model of the user&apos;s misconceptions.
Doug Appelt&apos;s contribution is an addition to his work
on the generation of referring expressions. He presents
a description of referring represented in modal logic,
and precisely defines concepts like sincerity and com-
petence. He also presents a schema for determining the
beliefs that a speaker and hearer hold after a referring
act, this being the ultimate goal of referring. The paper
following Appelt&apos;s, by Norbert Reithinger, examines
the production of referring expressions in a full dialog
system, complete with a graphical system for generating
actual pointing actions. His work is important in ex-
panding the discourse context of a generator to include
a shared visual situation.
Cecile Paris and Kathy McKeown&apos;s paper (in the
next section on connected discourse generation) de-
scribes an extension of McKeown&apos;s familiar discourse
strategies. The extension adds process strategies for
traversing causal nets to produce narrative-like descrip-
tions of complex physical objects. The implementation
they describe has a facility for switching between the
new procedural strategies and the old declarative ones.
Hans-Joachim Novak&apos;s paper describes discourse
strategies for generating object movement descriptions.
Interestingly, he uses a method that tries to model how
a description might be visualized by a hearer. He also
proposes some practical methods for generating refer-
ring expressions. His work is significant in tying gener-
ation to real-world object representations.
The third section is on generator design. It begins
with an excellent paper by Dave McDonald, Marie
Vaughan, and James Pustejovsky. They propose an
abstract reference model for generation, to enable com-
parison among generators. The reference model, simply
stated, is to identify the speaker&apos;s situation, map it onto
an utterance, and then read out the utterance. This
model is used to structure a discussion of factors in
generator design which contribute to efficiency. The
factors they discuss are precomputation of structure,
the size of steps between representational levels, ex-
ploitation of regularities in natural languages, efficient
control, and delayed evaluation of information.
Two other papers in this section describe specific
generation systems. Laurence Danlos is concerned with
determining what linguistic data should be used in what
part of the generation process. She gives a very detailed
treatment of various types of clause production, agree-
ment rules, deletion of repeated elements in coordi-
nates, and more in a description of her French and
English generator. Paul Jacobs is also concerned with

representation of linguistic knowledge, although his
main concern is extensibility. His English generator,
KING, uses a simple control scheme that exploits the
rich linguistic representations in a separate, frame-
based, hierarchical system. The section on grammars
and grammatical formalisms present detailed papers on
everything from the relevance of Tree Adjoining Gram-
mars to generation (by Aravind Joshi) to a formal model
of systemic grammar (by Terry Patten and Graeme
Ritchie). There is also a detailed description of a gen-
erator, by Harry Bunt, that uses pragmatic information.
The final sections primarily contain the contributions
of the psychologists. Koenraad De Smedt and Gerard
Kempen propose what is surely the first true computa-
tional model of sentence production that mimics the
incremental nature of human production. Their model,
which includes a monitoring component, captures var-
ious phenomena, such as hesitations, syntactic dead-
lock, and self-corrections, including modifications to
conceptual structures.
Another contribution by Willem Levelt and Herbert
Schriefers, explores stages of activation of lexical prop-
erties such as sound form and conceptual conditions.
One of the more interesting aspects that they address is
how a lexical item checks if its conceptual conditions
are satisfied. They extend the earlier idea of matching a
core sense to include checks on specificity of meaning.
One final paper is worth mention. Karen Kukich&apos;s
paper presents a connectionist implementation of part
of her stock market report generator. This is important,
but preliminary, work on architectures that could liber-
ate generators from serial processing schemes. How-
ever, we should not throw out our previous serial
schemes just yet.
On the whole, this book provides an important
source for research on many aspects of natural language
generation. Although the contributions are not of uni-
form quality and level of detail, most are very good.

computer science (artificial intelligence). She uses a
detailed linguistic analysis as the basis for a text gener-
ation system. In doing so, she has managed to come up
with ideas of interest to both fields.
The book describes the methodology behind a gen-
eration system whose aim is to produce &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; texts
from semantic representations of what is to be con-
veyed. Danlos says that there are two kinds of decisions
that must be made to do this:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.756059">
â¢ Conceptual decisions (e.g., what order should the
information be presented in, what should be made
explicit and what implicit?); and
â¢ Linguistic decisions (e.g., where should sentence
boundaries be made, what words should be used,
what syntactic constructions?).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999701529411765">
Danlos rather convincingly defends a claim that all of
these decisions are dependent on each other. For in-
stance, a decision to order the information in one way
will limit the choice of syntactic constructions available
(which in turn will limit lexical choice) and vice versa.
In addition, there is no a priori reason why priority
should be given to one of these decisions over the
others. The priority decision concerning a particular
semantic relation can only be made within a particular
domain after detailed linguistic analysis. In order for the
generation system to work, it must capture the available
conceptual and linguistic choices. Danlos advocates
encoding the choices in two structures, and illustrates
how the choices are determined and resulting structures
used for texts concerning direct causal relationships
(between an ACT and RESULTing state) within the
terrorist domain. The two structures she advocates are:

<listItem confidence="0.784364888888889">
1. A lexicon grammar that is specific to a particular
domain and semantic relationship and encodes the
possible simple sentences (lexical items) that can
be used to express concepts in the domain (e.g.,
the act and result in a direct causal relationship
such as a murder attempt); and
2. A discourse grammar that is specific to a particu-
lar semantic relation and encodes the remaining
choices.

Two other papers in this section describe specific generation systems. Laurence Danlos is concerned with determining what linguistic data should be used in what part of the generation process. She gives a very detailed treatment of various types of clause production, agreement rules, deletion of repeated elements in coordinates, and more in a description of her French and English generator. Paul Jacobs is also concerned with 114 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 Book Reviews The Linguistic Basis of Text Generation representation of linguistic knowledge, although his main concern is extensibility. His English generator, KING, uses a simple control scheme that exploits the rich linguistic representations in a separate, framebased, hierarchical system. The section on grammars and grammatical formalisms present detailed papers on everything from the relevance of Tree Adjoining Grammars to generation (by Aravind Joshi) to a formal model of systemic grammar (by Terry Patten and Graeme Ritchie). There is also a detailed description of a generator, by Harry Bunt, that uses pragmatic information. The final sections primarily contain the contributions of the psychologists. Koenraad De Smedt and Gerard Kempen propose what is surely the first true computational model of sentence production that mimics the incremental nature of human production. Their model, which includes a monitoring component, captures various phenomena, such as hesitations, syntactic deadlock, and self-corrections, including modifications to conceptual structures. Another contribution by Willem Levelt and Herbert Schriefers, explores stages of activation of lexical properties such as sound form and conceptual conditions. One of the more interesting aspects that they address is how a lexical item checks if its conceptual conditions are satisfied. They extend the earlier idea of matching a core sense to include checks on specificity of meaning. One final paper is worth mention. Karen Kukich&apos;s paper presents a connectionist implementation of part of her stock market report generator. This is important, but preliminary, work on architectures that could liberate generators from serial processing schemes. However, we should not throw out our previous serial schemes just yet. On the whole, this book provides an important source for research on many aspects of natural language generation. Although the contributions are not of uniform quality and level of detail, most are very good.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.999731534883721">In this book Laurence Danlos has been able to achieve a nice balance between straight linguistics and straight computer science (artificial intelligence). She uses a detailed linguistic analysis as the basis for a text generation system. In doing so, she has managed to come up with ideas of interest to both fields. The book describes the methodology behind a generation system whose aim is to produce &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; texts from semantic representations of what is to be conveyed. Danlos says that there are two kinds of decisions that must be made to do this: â¢ Conceptual decisions (e.g., what order should the information be presented in, what should be made explicit and what implicit?); and â¢ Linguistic decisions (e.g., where should sentence boundaries be made, what words should be used, what syntactic constructions?). Danlos rather convincingly defends a claim that all of these decisions are dependent on each other. For instance, a decision to order the information in one way will limit the choice of syntactic constructions available (which in turn will limit lexical choice) and vice versa. In addition, there is no a priori reason why priority should be given to one of these decisions over the others. The priority decision concerning a particular semantic relation can only be made within a particular domain after detailed linguistic analysis. In order for the generation system to work, it must capture the available conceptual and linguistic choices. Danlos advocates encoding the choices in two structures, and illustrates how the choices are determined and resulting structures used for texts concerning direct causal relationships (between an ACT and RESULTing state) within the terrorist domain. The two structures she advocates are: 1. A lexicon grammar that is specific to a particular domain and semantic relationship and encodes the possible simple sentences (lexical items) that can be used to express concepts in the domain (e.g., the act and result in a direct causal relationship such as a murder attempt); and 2. A discourse grammar that is specific to a particular semantic relation and encodes the remaining choices.</abstract>
