1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999633033898305">
Information extraction (IE) in the biomedical
domain is now regarded as an essential technique
for utilizing information contained in archived
journal articles and abstract collections such as
MEDLINE. Major domain databases often contain
incomplete and inconsistent results. Also, a
majority of the reported experimental results are
only available in unstructured full-text format.
These being combined, scientists need to check
with source journal articles to obtain and confirm
factual information. Furthermore, they often need
to start with document retrieval and face an
overwhelming number of candidate articles. Thus,
the significance of dynamic management of factual
information, specifically an integration and update
of experimental results, is self-evident. It would
not only save researchers much time used for
retrieval and redundant experiments but also help
them use the information more effectively. Given
the limitations of manual work in terms of both
efficiency and accuracy, IE focusing on factual
information is of critical importance.
Researches in bioNLP have made major
progress mainly in the extraction of bio-named
entity biological interactions (e.g. Craven et al.
1999; Humphreys et al., 2000; Tanabe et al., 2002).
But further progress aimed at pin-pointing and
organizing factual information remains a challenge.
We aim to provide a basis for this purpose. As
the first step, we proposed in (Mizuta and Collier,
2004) annotating biology texts in terms of
rhetorical zones with a shallow nesting, and
provided an annotation scheme. In this paper, we
explore a qualitative analysis of zone identification
(ZI) in biology articles and provide stronger
support for our framework toward automatic
annotation of zones. Specifically we; 1) illustrate
the linguistic and other features of each zone,
which have been extracted through our pilot study
of a total of 20 articles randomly selected from
four major online journals (EMBO, PNAS, NAR
and JCB), 2) discuss controversial cases for ZI and
nested annotation to elaborate the scheme, 3)
discuss multiple features relevant to ZI, and 4)
summarize the investigation and outline future
steps related to machine learning and applications.
Previous work on rhetorical analysis of scientific
articles focus on either; 1) hierarchical discourse
relations between sentences (e.g. Mann and
Thompson, 1987), 2) genre analysis within a
descriptive framework (e.g. Swales 1990), or 3) ZI
in a flat structure and a statistical evaluation of the
annotation scheme from a machine learning
perspective (e.g. Teufel and Moens, 2002). We
follow the lines of (Teufel and Moens, 2002) and
apply ZI to the domain of biology. But our
approach is unique in that we focus on
experimental results and on a qualitative analysis
of ZI as a basis for automatic ZI.

2 Overview of the framework

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968389">
2.1 The need for zone identification (ZI)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949">
We discuss below the critical issues in bioNLP
involved in pin-pointing and organizing factual
information and show how ZI can be applied.
First, articles provide information in various
rhetorical statuses (e.g. new vs. old results; own vs.
previous work). Current IE relies on surface lexical
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997583">
29
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997107666666667">
and syntactic patterns, neglecting the rhetorical
status of information. Thus, we are in danger of
extracting old results mixed with new ones.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9741455">
(1) Recent data suggest that ... ~ is involved in
DPC removal in mammalian cells (ref.), ...
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.921701">
...The data presented here suggest that ...
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929222222222">
The data (1) provide statements in different
rhetorical statuses (boldfaced by us). Preprocessing
the text in terms of such information helps filter
out old results (i.e. the first statement).
Secondly, so far the scope of bioNLP largely
bear on abstracts. But arguably, the final goal
should be full texts, given their much richer
sources of information and the increasing ease of
access (e.g. open access to collections such as
PUBMED-central; online journals such as EMBO,
PNAS, and JCB). This involves exploring new
techniques because there are some essential
differences from abstracts. Among others, full texts
present much more complexity in the sentence
structure and vocabulary (e.g. inserted phrases,
embedded sentences, nominalization of verbs,
more anaphoric expressions). Thus, we expect that
the analysis of the whole text requires a much
more complex set of patterns and algorithms, 1
resulting in errors. A solution to this problem is to
identify the subset of the article relevant to further
analysis at issue. For example, in order to extract
certain kinds of biological interactions found by
the author, we could skip statements about
previous work as seen in the Introduction section.
Thirdly, experimental results make sense in their
relation to the experimental goal and procedure.
Also, there are usually a sequence of experiments
performed, each of which obtains complex results.
Therefore, it is important to extract a set of
experimental results in an organized manner. This
also helps identify the reference of demonstratives
(e.g. this) and pronouns (e.g. it).
From these points of view, ZI in articles plays an
essential role in extracting factual information of
different sorts from different zone classes.

2.2 Characteristics of the framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973555555556">
The idea underlying ZI in our sense contrasts
with other, discourse relations-based notions (e.g.
Mann et al. 1987; Kando 1999; van Dijk, 1980);
we focus on the global type of information. For
example, in our ZI, reference to previous work as
background information remains as such whether it
is supported or refuted by the author later in the
article, whereas this difference plays an essential
role in discourse relations-based analyses.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.780764">

<bodyText confidence="0.925973">
the interactions between two biological elements from
PUBMED abstracts, about 400 patterns were necessary.
The larger picture we have consists of 2 levels;
1) ZI, and 2a) analysis of zone interactions (e.g.
discourse relations), or 2b) analysis on specific
zones (i.e. extraction of biological interactions). In
this paper we focus on the first step.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99985">
2.3 Annotation scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914375">
Our annotation scheme is proposed in (Mizuta et
al., 2004), based on Teufel et al.’s (2002) scheme.
Three major modifications are made; 1) a fine-
grained OWN class based on the model of an
experimental procedure which we identified across
journals, 2) CNN and DFF classes to cover the
relations between data/findings, and 3) nested
annotation. The set of zone classes is as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997840291666667">
• BKG (Background): given information
(reference to previous work or a generally
accepted fact)
• PBM (Problem-setting): the problem to be
solved; the goal of the present work/paper.
• OTL (Outline): a characterization/ summary of
the content of the paper.
• TXT (Textual): section organization of the paper
(e.g. “Section 3 describes our method”).
• OWN: the author’s own work:
◊ MTH (Method): experimental procedure;
◊ RSL (Result): the results of the experiment;
◊ INS (Insight): the author’s insights and findings
obtained from experimental results (including
the interpretation) or from previous work
◊ IMP (Implication): the implications of
experimental results (e.g. conjectures,
assessment, applications, future work) or those
of previous work
◊ ELS (Else): anything else within OWN.
• CNN (Connection): correlation or consistency
between data and/or findings.
• DFF (Difference): a contrast or inconsistency
between data and/or findings.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.967773285714286">
The basic annotation unit is a sentence, but in
some cases it may be a phrase. In light of those
cases which fit into multiple zones, we employ 2-
level annotation. Empirical analysis indicates that
even though zone classes are conceptually non-
overlapping, an annotation unit may fit into
multiple classes. That is, a linguistic unit (e.g. a
sentence) may well represent complex concepts.
Therefore, we consider that nested annotation is
necessary, even though it complicates annotation.

each zone

BKG has three tense variations; 1) simple
present for a generic statement about background
information (e.g. biological facts; reference to
previous work), 2) simple past, and 3) present
perfect, to mention the current relevance of
previous work. A wider range of verbs are used to
cover both biological and bibliographical facts.
Citations in the sentence-final position having as
its scope the whole sentence signal BKG, but inter-
sentential citations having a smaller scope do not.

3.2 PROBLEM SETTING (PBM )

The first type as illustrated above is observed in
the I-section2; it addresses the problem to solve. It
has a ‘negative polarity’ in that it mentions
something missing in the current situation (e.g.
knowledge, study, a research question). It contains
vocabulary expressing negation or incompleteness
(boldfaced). Tense variation is either simple
present or present perfect, depending on the
temporal interval referred to. The range of verbs
used has not been analyzed yet.

The second type of PBM is observed in the R-
section. As illustrated in (3), it corresponds to a to-
phrase appearing sentence-initially or finally. It is
combined with a description of experimental
procedure, as illustrated in (8).
The two types of PBM are both related to a goal
description. The first type concerns the whole work
and the second type its subset (i.e. an experiment).

The rhetorical scheme of the whole article is
analyzed as (5). OTL has as its scope “Body”, and
thus it is expected to appear either in Introduction
or Conclusion. This conforms to our investigation.
Tense choices are between simple present and
future (in Introduction), and between present
perfect and simple past (in Conclusion).
The first element of (4) signals the beginning of
an OTL zone. By itself it would fit into AIM (of
the paper) employed in (Teufel et al., 2002). It
contains certain kind of linguistic signals such as:3

However, OTL consists of a wider range of
sentences. As illustrated in (4), OTL also contains
those elements which provide information relevant
to other zones (e.g. PBM, MTH and RSL). We
consider that the whole sequence of sentences in
(4) deserve an independent class from both
theoretical and practical perspectives. That is, it is
embedded in a reporting context, and provides
abstract-like information. Thus, we propose OTL.

RSL usually describes an event in the past tense,
as MTH does, using a certain set of verbs
expressing; 1) phenomena (e.g. represent, show
and demonstrate, having as its subject the material
used), 2) observations (e.g. observe, recognize and
see, having we as its subject, or in the passive
form), or 3) biological processes (e.g. mutate,
translate, express, often in the passive form).

As illustrated above, RSL, unlike MTH, may
also be written in the present tense to create a
context in which the author observes and presents
the results real-time, referring to figures.
In the R-section, RSL zones were observed to
follow MTH with no discourse connectives.
However, the boundary was rather easy to identify,
by virtue of a cause-effect relation identified.
Specifically, matrix verbs used in these zones
played a critical role; some of them present a rather
complementary distribution. This feature is useful
for machine learning too.4
MTH and RSL may be combined by resulted in:

However, result in is usually observed in relating
biological events, and the above usage relating a
method and results is found uncommon. Also, the
explicit use of result(s) as below is uncommon:

Given these, keyword searches using result(s) do
not work for the purpose of identifying
experimental results. In contrast, RSL zones can be
identified using features such as matrix verbs and

In a RSL zone, empathetic expressions as in (13)
may be used, often sentence-initially, to call the
reader’s attention. The adjective version (e.g.
striking in (12)) is also used.
4 The occurrences in MTH/ RSL in our sample were:
perform 38/2, use 181/12, collect 10/1, purify 23/2,
observe 1/43, reduce 1/15, affect 1/15, associate 6/25.
However, some verbs had a rather neutral distribution
(e.g. detect 11/13, follow 26/8). Such cases require the

These are conventionalized forms which the author
uses in stating his/her interpretation of the results
with respect to a biological process behind the
observed results. A generalization is:5

Verb variations from our sample:
indicate/suggest/demonstrate/represent/reveal.
The second pattern is a sentence using the verb
seem/ appear or consider such as:
(17) X seem/appear to V (It seems/ appears that —)
X is considered to V
The third pattern is the use of confirm/ support:
(18) This was confirmed, as shown in Figure 3.
Here, this refers to the author’s hypothesis.
Although (18) refers to a figure which shows the
result, the sentence does not fit into RSL but into
INS. We consider that it describes the author’s
interpretation of the result and that the hypothesis
is now licensed as an insight. A generalization is:

the domain of experimental biology has a more
established methodology and that the focus is on
the experiments and the findings obtained. In other
domains where the methodology is less
standardized (e.g. computer science), we would
expect some essential cases fitting into ELS (e.g.

the role which zinc is claimed to play, deserving of
DFF as a whole (but there is no explicit clue at this
point). The key word in the third sentence, another
difference (boldfaced) licenses the sentence to
DFF and also indicates an element referring to a
difference already mentioned. Accordingly the first
two sentences will be annotated for DFF.
Precisely speaking, combined zones and nested
zones are not identical. But we treat combined
zones as a special case of nesting, as two zones
having the same scope and an arbitrary ordering.
Importantly, nested zones (in a wider sense) are
conceptually distinct from ambiguity between two
zones; the sentences simultaneously fit into

asymmetry also suggests the essential difference
between the biology and the computer science domains.
In the scheme by (Teufel et al., 2002) focusing on
computer science articles, CONTRAST seems to be

A PBM zone (in I-section) and an IMP zone
describing future work (or limitations) often look
very similar on the surface, as illustrated in (38),
which is the last sentence in the article describing
the limitation of the work presented. A critical
feature is the location; PBM in this use is located
in the I-section, whereas IMP in other sections.
A PBM zone in I-section (e.g. X remains
unclear) is considered to be a subset of a larger
BKG zone when the problem mentioned is a
generally accepted fact. However, we chose to
avoid nested annotation in this case, because; 1)
the situation above is rather common, and yet 2)
we identify the significance of PBM zone in its
own. In case a single sentence consists of a clause
fitting into BKG and another fitting into PBM,
then it will result in a complex annotation. That is,
we annotate the sentence as both BKG and PBM.

First, the essential components of D-section,
both quantitatively and qualitatively, are INS and

with the zone sequence in the R-section, INS and

The italicized elements in (43) - (45) would fit into
RSL or MTH, but are too small constituents to be
annotated. As a result, only the whole sentence
gets annotated as INS. A similar tendency holds
also for BKG (e.g. since-clause), but less
frequently. We may consider extracting these cases
in future work. Usually D-section ends with OTL
(summary) or IMP (assessment or future work).

<bodyText confidence="0.9999905">
We have provided a qualitative analysis of the
process and results of ZI based on our hand-
annotated sample, with a view to strengthening the
basis for the annotation scheme. We are now
starting to use our sample as training data for
machine learning, as well as creating more data in
a systematic way, toward automatic annotation.
We are also considering to use our ontology
management tool (Open Ontology Forge,
http://research.nii.ac.jp/~collier/resources/OOF/ind
ex.htm) for these purposes; 1) to define zone
classes as ontology classes; zone annotation is then
expected to be a variant of named entity annotation,
which we are familiar with, and 2) to link between
expressions referring to results (e.g. these results/
our results) and their antecedent (i.e. the RSL zone
providing a concrete description of the
experimental results), using the coreference tool.
Applications include full color representation of
annotated texts; a sample is available at:
http://research.nii.ac.jp/~collier/projects/ZAISA/in
dex.htm. Also, IR focusing on particular zone
classes should improve the quality of retrieval.
Specifically, the goal of the experiment (a PBM
zone) is expected to be used as an index for the
organization and retrieval of experimental results.
