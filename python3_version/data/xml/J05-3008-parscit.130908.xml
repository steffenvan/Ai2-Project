This monograph, based on Sandra K¨ubler’s
Ph.D. thesis, introduces the reader to research
at the intersection of data-driven parsing and
memory-based learning. Compared to other
approaches to parsing, including knowledge-
based methods, memory-based parsing takes
the provocative standpoint that new struc-
tures can be parsed by analogical reason-
ing over stored structures, rather than by
abstracted rules. All that the approach needs
is parsed example sentences stored in mem-
ory and a similarity function to find candidate
nearest-neighbor sentences that can act as the
basis for the analogical-reasoning step.
K¨ubler begins with a walk past the known
approaches in the field to partial and full
memory-based parsing. As for partial parsing
(constituent chunking and basic grammatical-
relation assignment such as subject-verb re-
lations), the work of Daelemans, Veenstra,
Buchholz, Tjong Kim Sang, and others using
memory-based learning is summarized, as
well as Krymolowski, Argamon, and Dagan’s
work on memory-based sequence learning.
K¨ubler then proceeds to review Streiter,
whose memory-based parser is an example of
a more holistic, sentence-oriented approach
which, in contrast to the aforementioned
approaches, needs a more complex similar-
ity metric to compute the distance between
a complete new sentence and stored parsed
sentences. A separate chapter is devoted to
data-oriented parsing, which uses probabi-
listic machinery and extensive back-off from
larger to smaller substructures, instead of
a single similarity function; in particular,
two nonprobabilistic variants by Bod and
De Pauw are close cousins of the other
memory-based approaches.
The heart of the book is the T¨uSBL (T¨ubing-
en Similarity-Based Learning) memory-based
parser, which implements a similarity-based
approach that, analogous to Streiter’s ap-
proach, attempts to fully parse complete sen-
tences by analogy, as rapidly as possible.
K¨ubler’s solution is original. While a naive
approach based on a similarity between full
sentences would be able to correctly parse
only a few sentences very close to sentences
in memory, K¨ubler introduces at least two
smart generalization enhancements. One is
that the T¨uSBL parser has more than one sim-
ilarity metric. When a new sentence is parsed,
it is first analyzed at the levels of part-of-
speech tags and base constituents. If no reli-
able nearest neighbors matching on the word
level can be found in memory, the other levels
act as back-offs on which to measure similar-
ity. The second enhancement is that the search
for nearest neighbors is extended by allowing
them to have a word or constituent too many
or too few or to be longer but contain a good
matching subtree. T¨uSBL’s similarity metric,
or rather its case-based reasoning function, is
actually aware of the internal structure of the
nearest-neighbor trees and the partial syntac-
tic structure of new sentences.
T¨uSBL is put to the test on the NEGRA-
formatted T¨uBa-DS treebank of spontaneous
speech in specific domains (hotel reser-
vations, business appointments, and travel
scheduling), gathered in the context of the
VERBMOBIL project. K¨ubler makes the cred-
ible point that data of this type offer a
more interesting challenge to parsing meth-
ods than nonspontaneous, professionally au-
thored texts in a (similarly) closed domain,
such as the Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank.
An excellent point is made on the limita-
tions of the standard PARSEVAL evaluation’s
focus on syntactic chunking and labeling;
arguably, the correctness of the parser in
assigning functional labels to grammatical re-
lations is at least as interesting as an eval-
uation metric. From the reported results we
learn that T¨uSBL does a good job; it attains a
PARSEVAL F-score of about 85 on the spon-
taneous speech corpus. We also learn that
the back-off part of T¨uSBL performs as well
as the whole T¨uSBL system in PARSEVAL
terms. This underlines the point that parsing
based on matching on smaller, local struc-
tures, as is done by most other memory-based
methods, performs at least on par with more
holistic methods. However, T¨uSBL’s holistic
memory-based core is more reliable in as-
signing correct functional tags to correctly
identified grammatical relations.
