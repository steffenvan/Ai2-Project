Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9994479">
In this paper we propose a methodology
for investigating the relationship between
architectures of natural language genera-
tion (NLG) systems and stylistic proper-
ties of texts. Biber&apos;s (1988) methodology
is used to obtain both the characterisation
of style of our corpus and the division of
the corpus into sets of linguistically
similar texts. These sets will be used for
studying the architectural aspects.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999784666666667">
We started our research with a survey of 19 ap-
plied natural language generation (NLG) systems
(Paiva, 1998) and noticed that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90354925">
• almost all the systems followed a pipeline
model;
• there was a general agreement on the core
NLG tasks that a system should perform
(e.g., aggregation, lexicalisation, etc.);
• the surveyed systems mainly differed on
the order the NLG tasks are executed (see
Cahill et al., 1999);
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999320411764706">
We also noticed that the texts produced by the
various systems were apparently quite different
stylistically (although we did not have a formal
method to measure how much different they
were) and, in order to explain how this variety of
texts was obtained with the same type of archi-
tecture (i.e., pipeline), we have put forward the
hypothesis that the order in which the NLG tasks
are executed influences the kind of text that can
be obtained, i.e. a certain order would facilitate
the generation of a certain type of text whilst
another would not.
This hypothesis goes in line with other re-
searchers&apos; results which purport to show that
architectural aspects of a NLG system depend on
the characteristics of the text to be generated and
vice versa. For instance:

• Robin (1994) argues for a revision-
incremental architecture for the generation
of structurally complex text with floating
content — i.e., content that can appear
anywhere in the text and is opportunisti-
cally realised only if stylistic factors of the
surrounding text allow;
• Inui and colleagues (1992) conclude that
in order to avoid the generation of text
with ambiguous and complex sentences a
revision architecture is necessary, with the
revision module placed at the end of the
generation process (i.e., after the linguistic
realisation)&apos;;
• Reiter (ms.) reports that pipeline architec-
tures cannot deal with constraints on the
length of a text.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999430777777778">
It is difficult however to reconcile their results
in a unified perspective since each of these re-
ported works started with a different perspective
and, generally, had different aims in mind.
We believe that it is possible to relate those
characteristics of text presented above (such as
complexity, ambiguity and sentence length)2 to
style,3 and that we can gain insight into NLG ar-
chitectures having a systematic way to classify
texts by their stylistic properties so that we can
analyse the architectural aspects in relation to
this stylistic classification.
We then start with the point of view that it is
reasonable to assume that certain styles of text
demand a more specialised type of architecture
than others (for example, a revision versus a
pipeline architectures) and our idea is to develop
a methodology for studying which are the appro-

Some aspects related to the complexity of a sentence (e.g.,
sentence length) can only be measured precisely when the
text has already been generated.

factors that can be related to the &apos;clarity&apos; of a text.

In this figure, one group expresses texts that
are formal, concise, and not interactive (text
type 1 — a possible example is news col-
turns in scientific magazines). Another group
(text type 2) expresses texts that are informal,
highly concise, and highly interactive (e.g.,
short articles in TV magazines answering
readers&apos; questions). A third one (text type 3)
can be considered neither formal nor infor-
mal, is not concise and has a medium value
for interactiveness.

priate architectures for the generation of texts in
a specific style or more than one style.
Hovy (1988) used a similar approach but char-
acterised style in such an informal way that its
relation to architectural aspects was compro-
mised; in particular, he could not ensure that he
was not missing important relations between
style and generator decisions5.
In this paper we will present a characterisation
of style and an approach for dealing with it
which, we hope, will provide a means to clarify
the interaction between the architectures of NLG
systems and the type of texts they can, or need
to, generate. The paper continues in the follow-
ing way: in Section 2 we present the definition of
style we are working with and in Section 3 we
show how this characterisation will help us to
deal with aspects of architecture. In Section 4 we
discuss the expected results and, finally, we con-
clude by presenting where we are in this process.

2 Investigating Style
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979384527272728">
We use the term style to signify the variability in
the use of features of a language that can be cor-
related with certain types of situation — where
situation can be regarded &amp;quot;as• the context within
which interaction of &apos;the speech event&apos; occurs&amp;quot;
(Brown and Fraser, 1979; p. 34), involving the
participants, the setting and the purposes of the
communication.
In order to put this definition to work on our
problem, first we need to know how to obtain the
set of stylistic parameters, i.e., the parameters
that, when varied, will be responsible for pro-
ducing texts in different styles. Secondly, we
need to find a way to group stylistically-similar
texts into sets so that we can study the architec-

PAULINE are but a first step. (...) The strategies

(Hovy, 1990; p. 193).
tural aspects of each set isolatedly and then try to
have a more general view of how style and NLG
architectures interact by making a cross-
comparison among those isolated analyses.
For the first part, there are two approaches in
the literature linking stylistic parameters to char-
acteristics of texts. We have already cited Hovy
(1988) and its main problem: the lack of formal-
ity. DiMarco&apos;s (1990) approach was to construct
a &apos;stylistic grammar&apos; using the notion of norm
and deviation from norm (see, e.g., Enkvist
(1973)). While this approach is enough to obtain
the stylistic parameters6, we think that this char-
acterisation brings a problem for grouping texts
into sets — it can create only two sets for study-
ing: the texts that agree with the norm and those
that do not. This can be a problem because, al-
though the texts following the norm will com-
prise a set of similar texts, those in the &apos;deviant&apos;
set can be so dissimilar that any type of analysis
based on them (and, consequently, its interpreta-
tion in architectural terms) is probably doomed
to failure.
In our approach we will avoid these problems
by following a methodology that can provide two
things: (1) a characterisation of the stylistic pa-
rameters of a corpus&apos;, and (2) a partition of a
corpus into sets of linguistically similar texts. We
are working with Biber&apos;s (1988) methodology.
From a corpus tagged with a comprehensive set
of linguistic features of English, we obtain the
frequency count associated with each one.8 Using
a statistical factor analysis, we group the linguis-
tic features that co-occur, considering each group

7 Our corpus comprises texts written for two different
audiences (patients and doctors) of more than 250 phar-
maceutical products — in total it is more than 500 texts.
8 There are two levels of tagging. First, the corpus is tagged
using Brill&apos;s (1994) tagger. Secondly, programs for
counting specific configurations of tags are run. The proc-
ess is completely automatic.

a stylistic parameter9 that can then be analysed in
functional terms.H3 Several stylistic parameters
can emerge from a corpus, each text of the cor-
pus having a specific value for each of them (see
an example with three stylistic parameters in
Figure 1-A).
Our interest in Biber&apos;s work is also related to
his definition of text types: &amp;quot;the texts within each
type are maximally similar with respect to their
linguistic characteristics, while the types are
maximally distinct with respect to their linguistic
characteristics&amp;quot; (Biber (1995), p. 10). In order to
obtain the text types, a cluster analysis is used
and results in the partitioning of the corpus (i.e.,
the texts with similar values for all the stylistic
parameters will be grouped in a partition (see
Figure 1-B)). Following this procedure will al-
low us to analyse aspects of architecture for each
text type (i.e., each partition) in isolation and,
more importantly, make cross-comparisons
among these analyses.

3 Relating Style to Architecture
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996155">
We are using NLG tasks as the basis for our ap-
proach to relate style to NLG architectures. We
are working with a set of core NLG task that we
have found to be stable: all of them occurred in
almost all the systems we surveyed (Paiva,
1998). The set comprises the following tasks:
content determination, rhetorical structuring,
lexicalisation, intra and inter-sentential ordering,
referring expression generation, aggregation,
segmentation, and linguistic realisation (for an
explanation about those task, see Cahill et al.,
1999).&amp;quot;
Part of the process for relating style to archi-
tecture is depicted in Figure 2. As shown, we
start by analysing the NW tasks that are respon-
sible for the presence of a specific linguistic
feature (arrow B). The association of stylistic
parameters with linguistic features obtained in
the corpus analysis (arrow A) will be used to
observe which NLG tasks are responsible for

Biber refers to this as a &apos;dimension of register variation&apos;.
I°The assumption is that strong co-occurrence patterns of
linguistic features mark underlying functional dimensions
(Biber, 1988; p. 13). Notice that the name of each stylistic
parameter, per se, means nothing; it is the linguistic fea-
tures grouped in each stylistic parameter that are impor-
tant! Nonetheless, it is easier to refer to a stylistic pa-
rameter by its name than to the set of linguistic features it
represents. So below we say that a certain text is formal,
when, in fact, we want to say that it has certain linguistic
features such as passives, formal words, conjuncts, etc.
&amp;quot;We are aware that some of those tasks can be subdivided
and that some authors assume different names for28le
same task. If necessary, we will do extensions to this set.
specific values of a stylistic parameter (ar-
row C),I2
Then we will observe the combinations of the
NLG tasks in accordance with each text type
(partition) obtained in the corpus analysis. This
will give us an idea of which NLG tasks are most
responsible for (the linguistic features associated
with) the different text types; also, it will show
us how the tasks are working (because of the
links to the linguistic features (see Figure 2)).
The result of this process will be sets of NLG
tasks for each text type.
E.g.:

rameter.
Our work then will be to observe the NLG tasks
(inside each text type first, but making cross-
comparisons among text types afterwards) at-
tacking the questions related to architecture, i.e.,
&apos;which kind of modularisation and interaction
between modules is necessary/appropriate&apos;,
&apos;which resources are used&apos;, &apos;what kind of data
the modules/tasks exchange&apos;, etc.
We will investigate architectural decisions at
three different levels:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995941818181818">
• at the task level: how can a certain task be
made sensitive to values of stylistic pa-
rameters?
• at the level of tasks interaction: is there a
natural ordering of tasks for a certain type
of text?I3
• at the global level: assuming that tasks are
normally encapsulated inside modules,
what characteristics of texts force the in-
teraction between modules to be more in-
tense?
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.983956333333333">

derived gives a measure of how important the linguistic
feature is for a certain stylistic parameter.

execution of tasks can favour a certain textual result over
another.

Faced with this classification we will propose
solutions that can be used in the specification of
an architecture that supports the generation of
texts in different styles. We expect these solu-
tions to lead to useful guidelines for helping de-
signers of NLG systems to choose the appropriate
architecture for the type of text they want their
system to generate.

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967388888889">
One may question why we are repeating Biber&apos;s
experiment, when he has already obtained a set
of stylistic parameters and a set of text types. It
is possible that other results emerge from apply-
ing his methodology to our corpus, and the only
way to know this will be by re-doing the analy-
sis. It is also possible that we obtain a subset of
his results, which will at least make our task a
more manageable one.
We believe that our result will be of general
utility. Although the precise set of stylistic pa-
rameters may be dependent on the corpus one is
using, we expect that the set of valid task inter-
action patterns will be restricted, and that the text
types emerging from our study will encompass
most of the valid patterns. Our programs for
counting the linguistic features will be made
available for others to use.

In this paper we propose a methodology for in-
vestigating the relationship between architectures
of NLG systems and stylistic properties of the
texts they can generate. Although we are still
undertaking the first steps of our methodology
(the corpus analysis), we believe that this meth-
odology will allow us to test the hypothesis re-
garding the order of execution of NLG tasks, and
at least provide initial indicators on the relation-
ship between classes of architectures and the
style of generated texts.

We are working with a set of core NLG task that we have found to be stable: all of them occurred in almost all the systems we surveyed (Paiva, 1998). The set comprises the following tasks: content determination, rhetorical structuring, lexicalisation, intra and inter-sentential ordering, referring expression generation, aggregation, segmentation, and linguistic realisation (for an explanation about those task, see Cahill et al., 1999).&amp;quot; Part of the process for relating style to architecture is depicted in Figure 2.
