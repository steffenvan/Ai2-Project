In his review in Computational Linguistics (15,1) of Man-
aster—Ramer 1987, Barron Brainerd states that Definition
9 of my contribution to this volume is circular, thereby
rendering the definiendum ill-defined. I believe this criti-
cism to be without foundation. The crucial part of the
definition in question is as follows:
[pi] denotes the set of all and only those strings Z for
which it is the case that for any property pi distinct from
Pt&apos; Z E I p I n [m] if there is a dependency chain
containing pi and pi.
I suspect that the appearance of circularity is due to the
presence of the definiendum in the body of the definition,
but this need not be pernicious (it is not, for example, in a
properly formulated recursive definition); nor, I submit, is
it in the present case. From parts of the theory developed
earlier in the paper it follows that every ungrammatical
string possesses multiple etiological properties if there is
more than one such property given the rules of the language;
suppose then that for some e.p. pi possessed by a string Z
there is a dependency chain consisting of p1 and every e.p.
pi pi such that Z E Ip,p I. According to the definition,
Z E I pil 1) [pi] whence Z E [A]; by contrast, if there is
no such chain, then Z is not in I pi 1 11 [pi]; further, since
Ip,pI C IpI (by Definitions 7 and 8), Z is in I pi I and
hence not in [pi]. Thus, [pi] is well-defined after all.
