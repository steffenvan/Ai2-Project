Subscriptions to CL are available only through membership in
the ACL. Each subscription includes both hard-copy and
microfiche versions of the journal.
Back issues of the AJCL may be ordered at annual rates of
$15 for orders from personal members, $30 from institutional
members. The first five volumes (1974-1978) are available
only on microfiche; add $3 for first class mailing in North
America; $6 for air printed mailing overseas. Volumes 6 — 9
(1980-1983) are available in both hard-copy and microfiche
form; add $6 for first class, $12 for air printed mail. The
AJCL was not published during 1979.
Annual dues are $15 for personal and $30 for institutional
memberships. A joint membership for couples that provides
one subscription is available for $20. The dues payment in-
cludes bulk or surface mailing fees. First class mailing is
available in North America for an additional $6; air printed
mailing is available overseas for an additional $12.
Address changes should be sent to the ACL Secretary-
Treasurer.
Payments for dues or back issues should be made payable to
the Association for Computational Linguistics (or ACL). Pay-
ments sent to the ACL Secretary-Treasurer should be payable
in US dollars. Payments from people in Europe or with Swiss
accounts should be sent to the European Chapter Treasurer;
they can be paid in Swiss francs, by personal checks in the
currency of that country, or by a banker&apos;s draft that credits
account 141.880.LAV at the Union Bank of Switzerland, 8 rue
de Rhone, CH-1211 Geneva 11, SWITZERLAND. European
residents can get information on currency conversion values
from the European Chapter Secretary.
A Note from the Editor:
With this issue, our name has changed from AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPUTATION-
AL LINGUISTICS to COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS. While name changes are always
difficult for all involved — we spent a year deciding on the new name — the greatest
problems are faced by libraries, which now have to recatalogue the journal and create
schemes for retaining the continuity of the volumes through the name change. Even
with all these difficulties, however, it was felt that a name change was long overdue.
The ACL is an international organization, yet the journal retained a name that reflect-
ed its origins but was misleading.
I am pleased that the journal is approaching the point of regular, on-time publica-
tion. The goal set out at last year&apos;s ACL meeting was to have completed volume 9,
which was then not begun, by the next ACL meeting. My secret hope was that we
could do better than that, and have the the first issue of volume 10, this issue, com-
pleted before the meeting as well. (I won&apos;t divulge what my secret fears were!) So, we
came close to the more ambitious goal. This issue will be at the printers while COLING
84 is in progress.
Looking ahead, the goal for the next year is to have the journal on schedule by the
1985 ACL meeting. COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS still can offer rapid publication of
your papers while our backlog remains low as a result of our increased publication
schedule. A paper submitted in the summer of &apos;84 that was accepted without revision
could appear in print in the spring of 1985.

A Note from the ACL Secretary-Treasurer:
I will be leaving SRI International (after 13 years) to join Bell Communications
Research, a new company formed to serve the seven regional telephone operating
companies in the same capacity that Bell Laboratories has served AT&amp;T. The move
will take place at the end of July. Future communications should be directed to me as
indicated below. I recognize that this change will create difficulties; so please accept
my apologies for the inconveniences that will inevitably result.

Guidelines for Formatting Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998362357142857">
Manuscripts submitted to COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS should be typed on letter-size
paper (8.5 by 11 inch or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The full first name and initial of each author should be provided, followed by the
corresponding institutions and complete mailing addresses. Manuscripts must be submit-
ted in English.
The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
It should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principle
conclusions and recommendations. It is preferable that the abstract not be in the first
person, and it should not contain any mathematical notation or cite references. Work
planned but not completed should not appear. Since the abstract will be used to select
appropriate referees, it is essential to make it as informative as possible.
References should be listed alphabetically by author at the end of the paper according
to the following style, where the naming convention is &apos;Surname, Firstname Initial.&apos; and
multiple authors are separated by semicolons, the last one being preceded by &amp;quot;and&amp;quot;:

continued overleaf
Footnotes should be avoided as much as possible. Whenever it does not impede the logic
or readability of the paper, footnote material should be integrated into the text. When
necessary, they should be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the article and
appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced.
Notation should be selected so as to simplify the phototypesetting process. Also, figures
should be devised with consideration for whether they would require one column or two
columns in the text. All figures in the final manuscript will be the author&apos;s responsibility.
For initial submission of papers for refereeing, the figures should be integrated into the
text as much as possible, rather than being inserted at the end of the document. Original
line drawings must be drawn in black ink on white paper; the lines should be heavy
enough to reproduce well. Photographs should be in black and white on glossy paper.
Computer printout is not acceptable for figures; any such copy should be redone in a
comparable type font.
CL is interested in esploring the use of electronic submission for the final manuscript, for
those able to produce and transmit copy in that form. We are prepared to handle both
tape and network transmissions. For such a submission, it is essential to reduce the
problems entailed in introducing format commands. The easiest situation for our Produc-
tion Editor at present is to eliminate all such commands, separating sections that are
handled differently by blank lines. It is, of course, essential to accompany the electronic
transmission with a graphic version that indicates the preferred format. It should be
recognized that deviations from personal preferences may occur in the interest of ensuring
a more consistent style for our journal. Electronic submissions should be sent directly to
the Production Editor at the mailing or net addresses provided on the inside front cover.
