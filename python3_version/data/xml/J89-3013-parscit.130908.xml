Machine translation (MT) has focused on the problems
of syntax and semantics at the sentence level, but the
real goal of MT is to translate texts, a fact that has been
generally overlooked. There is a crucial difference
between a text and a set of unrelated sentences, and in
MT, one must avoid destroying the former by translat-
ing it into the latter. It is the coherence of text in
particular that Papegaaij and Schubert address. They
aim to examine the role of text phenomena in machine
translation, to assess the feasibility of a number of
suggested models of text coherence for MT, and to
propose solutions.
The book consists of three chapters: introductory
material, a chapter on the clues and devices of text
coherence, and a chapter on text coherence in transla-
tion.
The introductory chapter (11 pages) summarizes the
main approaches to text linguistics, reviews the Distrib-
uted Language Translation project (with which the
authors are associated), and introduces the relevant
terminology. Chapter 2 (139 pages) is the background
chapter for understanding the techniques that can be
used to render text coherent. It begins with a study of
the kinds of decisions involved in a sample translation,
and then surveys the maintenance of text coherence
through deictic reference, word disambiguation (by
means of a shared context), thematic progression, the
structure-building properties of verbs, and, on a higher
level, rhetorical patterns. This review of diverse devices
for text coherence is illustrated by showing how they
contribute to the coherence of a sample text. This
chapter covers essentially the same ground as Halliday
and Hasan (1976), but in less detail and with a slant to
translation.
In Chapter 3 (41 pages), the authors follow up on this
review to consider text coherence from the standpoint
of translation. A systematic summary of the coherence
devices discussed earlier is given, grouped under the
headings: coherence of entities, coherence of focus, and
coherence of events. This chapter also focuses more
explicitly on the question of how to maintain text
coherence in a MT system.
The strength (and the bulk) of the book is the quite
thorough discussion of the text coherence devices that
are relevant in MT. A reader unfamiliar with the prob-
lem of maintaining coherence in translation will receive
a useful tutorial in the possible approaches. However, it
should be noted that, as the authors themselves point
out, &amp;quot;the reader [may be] somewhat unsatisfied and
[have] a feeling of having been offered just another
series of sample analyses and just another, sketchy,
model of text structure. This may appear to be so, at
least to a casual reader. . . [However], it has . . . been
our aim to make some steps towards (preliminary)
implementation possible right now, although we are
aware of the fact that much more research of both a
fundamental and an application-oriented nature remains
to be done&amp;quot; (p. 198). The book will therefore be of
interest to readers who want an introduction to a
difficult problem in MT but who recognize that, as of
now, solutions remain preliminary and still theoretical.

This book describes the Dutch firm BSO&apos;s machine
translation system DLT at a very early stage in its
development. The book is organized into four parts,
each with its separate set of chapters. Part I is an
introduction to the problems of NLP in general, and MT
in particular, for the neophyte. Part II describes the
&amp;quot;Semantic Word Expert System&amp;quot; in some (not exhaus-
tive) detail, describing its workings primarily in the
future tense. Part III describes the &amp;quot;Semantic Work
Bench&amp;quot; development tool that is being developed for
development of the DLT lexicons. Part IV discusses
&amp;quot;Future Developments&amp;quot; in DLT, all the way up to
&amp;quot;The Ultimate Aim,&amp;quot; which turns out (p. 207) to be a
system for multidirectional machine translation, multi-
lingual information retrieval and document indexing,
