This meeting of the Psychocomputational Models of Human Language Acquisition (PsychoCompLA
2005) workshop is a follow-up meeting of the first PsychoCompLA workshop help in 2004 in Geneva,
Switzerland where it was part of the 20th International Conference on Computational Linguistics
(COLING 2004). This year, the workshop was part of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association
for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2005) held in Ann Arbor, Michigan and shared a joint session
with the Ninth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2005).
This workshop brings together scientists whose (at least one) line of investigation is to computationally
model the process by which humans acquire various aspects of natural language. Progress in this agenda
not only directly informs developmental psycholinguistic and linguistic research but will also have the
long term benefit of informing applied computational linguistics in areas that involve the automated
acquisition of knowledge from a human or human-computer linguistic environment.
The scientific program consisted of two invited talks, one by Brian MacWhinney and another by Mark
Steedman, and 10 paper presentations.
We were especially pleased with the high quality of the submissions and would like to thank the
authors for submitting their papers, as well as Mirella Lapata (ACL Workshop Committee Chair),
Jason Eisner, Philipp Koehn (Publications Chairs) and Dragomir Radev (Local Arrangements Chair)
who were extremely helpful (and patient) on more than one occasion.
