Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9997545625">
The Speech Graffiti interface is designed to be
a portable, transparent interface for spoken
language interaction with simple machines
and information servers. Because it is a subset
language, users must learn and adhere to the
constraints of the language. We conducted a
user study to determine habitability and found
that more than 80% of utterances were Speech
Graffiti-grammatical, suggesting that the lan-
guage is acceptably learnable and usable for
most users. We also analyzed deviations from
grammaticality and found that natural lan-
guage input accounted for the most deviations
from Speech Graffiti. The results will suggest
changes to the interface and can also inform
design choices in other speech interfaces.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991005882353">
Speech Graffiti (a.k.a. the Universal Speech Interface
project) is an attempt to create a standardized, speech-
based interface for interacting with simple machines and
information servers. Such standardization offers several
benefits, including domain portability, lower speech
recognition error rates and increased system transpar-
ency for users (Rosenfeld et al., 2001). This is realized
via a subset language that must be learned and remem-
bered by users.
This study was designed to assess habitability by
measuring Speech Graffiti-grammaticality: how often
do users actually speak within the subset grammar when
interacting with a Speech Graffiti system? A high level
of grammaticality would suggest that the language is
reasonably habitable, while low grammaticality would
indicate that the language design requires substantial
changes.

1.1 Speech Graffiti basics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998155">
Speech Graffiti interfaces comprise a small set of stan-
dard rules and keywords that can be used in all Speech
Graffiti applications. The rules are principles governing
the regularities in the interaction, such as “input is al-
ways provided in phrases with the syntax ‘slot is
value’” and “the system will tersely paraphrase what-
ever part of the input it understood.” The keywords are
designed to provide regular mechanisms for performing
interaction universals such as help, orientation, naviga-
tion and error correction.
By standardizing user input, Speech Graffiti aims to
reduce the negative effects of variability on system
complexity and recognition performance. At the same
time, we hope that introducing a universal structure that
is intended to be used with many different applications
will mitigate any negative effects that might be other-
wise associated with learning an application-specific
command language.

Although several studies have previously explored the
usage of constrained or subset languages (for example,
Hendler &amp; Michaelis, 1983; Guindon &amp; Shuldberg,
1987; Ringle &amp; Halstead-Nussloch, 1989; Sidner &amp;
Forlines, 2002), they have generally been concerned
with performance effects such as task completion rates.
Sidner &amp; Forlines (2002) reported a “correct utterance”
rate of approximately 60-80% for their user studies,
although this was not a main focus of their work. While
we understand the focus on such performance measures,
we believe that it is also important to understand how
habitable the constrained language is for users, in what
ways users deviate from it, and what impact habitability
has on user satisfaction.

<bodyText confidence="0.999938">
Our data was generated from a user study in which par-
ticipants were asked to complete tasks using both a
Speech Graffiti interface to a telephone-based movie
information system (MovieLine) and a natural language
interface to the same data. Tasks were designed to have
the participants explore a variety of the functions of the
systems (e.g. “list what’s playing at the Squirrel Hill
Theater” and “find out &amp; write down what the ratings
are for the movies showing at the Oaks Theater”).
After interacting with each system, each participant
completed a user satisfaction questionnaire rating 34
subjective-response items on a 7-point Likert scale. This
questionnaire was based on the Subjective Assessment
of Speech System Interfaces (SASSI) project (Hone &amp;
Graham, 2001) and included statements such as “I al-
ways knew what to say to the system” and “the system
makes few errors.” An overall user satisfaction rating
was calculated for each user by averaging that user’s
scores for each of the 34 response items. Users were
also asked a few comparison questions, including sys-
tem preference. In this analysis we were only concerned
with results from the Speech Graffiti MovieLine
interactions and not the natural language MovieLine
interactions (see Tomko &amp; Rosenfeld, 2004). System
presentation order was balanced and had no significant
effect on grammaticality measures.

<bodyText confidence="0.99999875">
Twenty-three participants (12 female, 11 male) accessed
the systems via telephone in our lab. Most were under-
graduate students from Carnegie Mellon University and
all were native speakers of American English. We also
asked users whether they considered themselves “com-
puter science or engineering people” (CSE) and how
often they did computer programming; the distributions
of these categories were roughly equal.

2.2 Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970352941177">
The Speech Graffiti approach requires users to learn the
system prior to using it via a brief tutorial session. 15
participants received unsupervised Speech Graffiti train-
ing consisting of a self-directed, web-based tutorial that
presented sample dialog excerpts (in text) and proposed
example tasks to the user. The other eight participants
received supervised Speech Graffiti training. This train-
ing used the same web-based foundation as the unsu-
pervised version, but participants were encouraged to
ask the experimenter questions if they were unsure of
anything during the training session.
Both supervised and unsupervised training sessions
were balanced between web-based tutorials that used
examples from the MovieLine and from a FlightLine
system that provided simulated flight arrival, departure,
and gate information. This enabled us to make an initial
assessment of the effects of in-domain training.

2.3 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999387">
The user study generated 4062 Speech Graffiti Movie-
Line utterances, where an utterance is defined as one
chunk of speech input sent to our Sphinx II speech rec-
ognizer (Huang et al., 1993). We removed all utterances
containing non-task-related or unintelligible speech, or
excessive noise or feed, resulting in a cleaned set of
3626 utterances (89% of the total). We defined an utter-
ance to be grammatical if the Phoenix parser (Ward,
1990) used by the system returns a complete parse with
no extraneous words.

3 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998519555555555">
82% (2987) of the utterances from the cleaned set were
fully Speech Graffiti-grammatical. For individual users,
grammaticality ranged from 41.1% to 98.6%, with a
mean of 80.5% and a median of 87.4%. These averages
are quite high, indicating that most users were able to
learn and use Speech Graffiti reasonably well.
The lowest individual grammaticality scores be-
longed to four of the six participants who preferred the
natural language MovieLine interface to the Speech
Graffiti one, which suggests that proficiency with the
language is very important for its acceptance. Indeed,
we found a moderate, significant correlation between
grammaticality and user satisfaction, as shown in Fig. 1
(r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.01). We found no similar correlation for
the natural language interface, using a strict definition
of grammaticality.
Users’ grammaticality tended to increase over time.
For each subject, we compared the grammaticality of
utterances from the first half of their session with that of
utterances in the second half. All but four participants
increased their grammaticality in the second half of their
Speech Graffiti session, with an average relative im-
provement of 12.4%. A REML analysis showed this
difference to be significant, F = 7.54, p &lt; 0.02. Only one
of the users who exhibited a decrease in grammaticality
over time was from the group that preferred the natural
language interface. However, although members of that
that group did tend to increase their grammaticality later
in their interactions, none of their second-half gram-
maticality scores were above 80%.
Summary by training and system preference. No
significant effects on Speech Graffiti-grammaticality
were found due to differences in CSE background, pro-
gramming experience, training supervision or training
domain. This last point suggests that it may not be nec-
essary to design in-domain Speech Graffiti tutorials;

instead, a single training application could be devel-
oped. The six users who preferred the natural language
MovieLine generated 45.4% of the ungrammaticalities,
further supporting the idea of language proficiency as a
major factor for system acceptance.

3.1 Deviations from grammar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999704379310345">
To help determine how users can be encouraged to
speak within the grammar, we analyzed the ways in
which they deviated from it in this experiment. We
identified 14 general types of deviations from the gram-
mar; Fig. 2 shows the distribution of each type. Four
trivial deviation types (lighter bars in Fig. 2) that
resulted from unintentional holes in our grammar cover-
age comprised about 20% of the ungrammaticalities.
When these trivial deviations are counted as grammati-
cal, mean grammaticality rises to 85.5% and the median
to 91.3%. However, we have not removed the trivial
ungrammaticalities from our overall analysis since they
are likely to have resulted in errors that may have af-
fected user satisfaction. Each of the ten other deviation
types is discussed in further detail in the sections below.
General natural language syntax, 20.6%: Speech
Graffiti requires input to have a slot is value phrase syn-
tax for specifying and querying information. The most
common type of deviation in the Speech Graffiti utter-
ances involved a natural language (NL) deviation from
this standard phrase syntax. For example, a correctly
constructed Speech Graffiti query to find movie times at
a theater might be theater is Galeria, title is Sweet Home
Alabama, what are the show times? For errors in this cate-
gory, users would instead make more NL-style queries,
like when is Austin Powers playing at Showcase West?
Slot only, 14.6%: In these cases, users stated a slot
name without an accompanying value or query words.
For example, a user might attempt to ask about a slot
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999374">
Figure 2. Distribution of ungrammatical
utterances by type.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998649875">
without using what, as in title is Abandon, show times. In
about a third of slot-only instances, the ungrammatical
input appeared to be an artifact of the options function,
which lists slots that users can talk about at any given
point; users would just repeat back a slot name without
adding a value, confirming Brennan’s (1996) findings of
lexical entrainment.
Out-of-vocabulary word, 14.0%: These were often
movie titles that were not included in the database or
synonyms for Speech Graffiti-grammatical concepts
(e.g. category instead of genre).
Keyword problem, 8.1%: Participants used a key-
word that was not part of the system (e.g. clear) or they
used an existing keyword incorrectly.
Value only, 6.7%: Users specified a value (e.g.
comedy) without an accompanying slot name.
Slot-value mismatch, 5.1%: Users paired slots and
values that did not belong together. This often occurred
when participants were working on tasks involving lo-
cating movies in a certain neighborhood. For instance,
instead of stating area is Monroeville, users would say
theater is Monroeville. Since the input is actually in the
correct slot is value format, this type of ungrammaticality
could perhaps be considered more of a disfluency than a
true habitability problem.
Disfluency, 4.3%: This category includes utterances
where the parser failed because of disfluent speech,
usually repeated words. 81% of the utterances in this
category were indeed grammatical when stripped of
their disfluencies, but we prefer to leave this category as
a component of the non-trivial deviations in order to
account for the unpredictable disfluencies that will al-
ways occur in interactions.
More syntax, 4.0%: This is are a special case of a
keyword problem in which participants misused the
keyword more by pairing it with a slot name (e.g. theater,
more) rather than using it to navigate through a list.
Time syntax, 1.3%: In this special case of natural
language syntax ungrammaticality, users created time
queries that were initially well-formed but which had
time modifiers appended to the end, as in what are show
times after seven o’clock?
Value + options, 1.1%: In grammatical usage, the
keyword options can be used either independently (to get
a list of all available slots) or paired with a slot (to get a
list of all appropriate values for that slot). In a few
cases, users instead used options with a value, as in Squir-
rel Hill options.

Based on the data shown in Fig.1, it appears that
80% is a good target for Speech Graffiti grammaticality.
Nearly all participants with grammaticality scores over
80% gave positive (i.e. &gt; 4) user satisfaction scores, and
more than half of our users achieved this level. Fur-
thermore, users with grammaticality above 80% com-
pleted an average of 6.9 tasks, while users with
grammaticality below 80% completed an average of
only 3.5 tasks. A fundamental question for our future
work is “what can we do to help everyone speak within
the bounds of the system at the 80% level?”
Several possible refinements are immediately appar-
ent beyond fixing our trivial grammar problems. System
responses to options should be reworked to reduce incor-
rect lexical entrainment and alleviate slot-only devia-
tions. The out-of-vocabulary instances can be analyzed
to decide whether certain synonyms should be added to
the current system, although this will generate only do-
main-specific improvements. Many ungrammaticality
types can also be addressed through refinements to
Speech Graffiti’s help and tutorial functions.
Addressing the general NL syntax category poses
the biggest problem. Although it is responsible for the
largest portion of ungrammaticalities, simply changing
the grammar to accommodate these variations would
likely lead to increased system complexity. A main con-
cern of our work is domain portability, and Speech
Graffiti’s standard structure currently allows for fairly
rapid creation of new interfaces (Toth et al., 2002). Any
natural language expansion of Speech Graffiti grammar
will have to be balanced with the ability to port such a
grammar to all domains. We are currently analyzing the
ungrammatical utterances in this and the time syntax
categories to determine whether any Speech Graffiti-
consistent modifications could be made to the interface.
However, most of the improvement in this area will
likely have to be generated via better help and training.
An important additional finding from this work is
the scope of general NL syntax deviations. Considering
items like movie and theater names as equivalence class
members, the NL utterances used by participants in the
Speech Graffiti system reduced to 94 patterns. In com-
parison, the NL utterances used by participants in the
natural language MovieLine reduced to about 580 pat-
terns. One of the main differences between the NL pat-
terns in the two systems was the lack of conversational
phrases like “can you give me...” and “I would like to
hear about...” in the Speech Graffiti system. Thus the
knowledge that they are interacting with a restricted
language system seems to be enough to make users
speak more simply, matching results from Ringle &amp;
Halstead-Nussloch (1989).
Although many of our ungrammaticality types may
appear to be specific to Speech Graffiti, they reinforce
lessons applicable to most speech interfaces. The slot-
only issue demonstrates that lexical entrainment truly is
a factor in spoken language interfaces and its effects
should not be underestimated. Out-of-vocabulary words
are a persistent problem, and keywords should be cho-
sen with care to ensure that they are task-appropriate
and that their functions are as intuitive as possible.
Overall, this study has provided us with a target
level for Speech Graffiti-grammaticality, suggested
changes to the language and provided insight about
what aspects of the system might need greater support
through help and tutorial functions. We plan to imple-
ment changes based on these results and re-evaluate the
system through further user testing.

Both supervised and unsupervised training sessions were balanced between web-based tutorials that used examples from the MovieLine and from a FlightLine system that provided simulated flight arrival, departure, and gate information. This enabled us to make an initial assessment of the effects of in-domain training. 2.3 Analysis The user study generated 4062 Speech Graffiti MovieLine utterances, where an utterance is defined as one chunk of speech input sent to our Sphinx II speech recognizer (Huang et al., 1993). We removed all utterances containing non-task-related or unintelligible speech, or excessive noise or feed, resulting in a cleaned set of 3626 utterances (89% of the total). We defined an utterance to be grammatical if the Phoenix parser (Ward, 1990) used by the system returns a complete parse with no extraneous words. 3 Results 82% (2987) of the utterances from the cleaned set were fully Speech Graffiti-grammatical. For individual users, grammaticality ranged from 41.1% to 98.6%, with a mean of 80.5% and a median of 87.4%. These averages are quite high, indicating that most users were able </context>

Sidner &amp; Forlines (2002) reported a “correct utterance” rate of approximately 60-80% for their user studies, although this was not a main focus of their work.

In comparison, the NL utterances used by participants in the natural language MovieLine reduced to about 580 patterns. One of the main differences between the NL patterns in the two systems was the lack of conversational phrases like “can you give me...” and “I would like to hear about...” in the Speech Graffiti system. Thus the knowledge that they are interacting with a restricted language system seems to be enough to make users speak more simply, matching results from Ringle &amp; Halstead-Nussloch (1989). Although many of our ungrammaticality types may appear to be specific to Speech Graffiti, they reinforce lessons applicable to most speech interfaces. The slotonly issue demonstrates that lexical entrainment truly is a factor in spoken language interfaces and its effects should not be underestimated. Out-of-vocabulary words are a persistent problem, and keywords should be chosen with care to ensure that they are task-appropriate and that their functions are as intuitive as possible. Overall, this study has provided us with a target level for Speech Graffiti-grammaticality, suggested changes </context>

The results will suggest changes to the interface and can also inform design choices in other speech interfaces. 1 Introduction Speech Graffiti (a.k.a. the Universal Speech Interface project) is an attempt to create a standardized, speechbased interface for interacting with simple machines and information servers. Such standardization offers several benefits, including domain portability, lower speech recognition error rates and increased system transparency for users (Rosenfeld et al., 2001). This is realized via a subset language that must be learned and remembered by users. This study was designed to assess habitability by measuring Speech Graffiti-grammaticality: how often do users actually speak within the subset grammar when interacting with a Speech Graffiti system? A high level of grammaticality would suggest that the language is reasonably habitable, while low grammaticality would indicate that the language design requires substantial changes. 1.1 Speech Graffiti basics Speech Graffiti interfaces comprise a small set of standard rules and keywords that can be used in all </context>

Users were also asked a few comparison questions, including system preference. In this analysis we were only concerned with results from the Speech Graffiti MovieLine interactions and not the natural language MovieLine interactions (see Tomko &amp; Rosenfeld, 2004). System presentation order was balanced and had no significant effect on grammaticality measures. 2.1 Participants Twenty-three participants (12 female, 11 male) accessed the systems via telephone in our lab. Most were undergraduate students from Carnegie Mellon University and all were native speakers of American English. We also asked users whether they considered themselves “computer science or engineering people” (CSE) and how often they did computer programming; the distributions of these categories were roughly equal. 2.2 Training The Speech Graffiti approach requires users to learn the </context>

Many ungrammaticality types can also be addressed through refinements to Speech Graffiti’s help and tutorial functions. Addressing the general NL syntax category poses the biggest problem. Although it is responsible for the largest portion of ungrammaticalities, simply changing the grammar to accommodate these variations would likely lead to increased system complexity. A main concern of our work is domain portability, and Speech Graffiti’s standard structure currently allows for fairly rapid creation of new interfaces (Toth et al., 2002). Any natural language expansion of Speech Graffiti grammar will have to be balanced with the ability to port such a grammar to all domains. We are currently analyzing the ungrammatical utterances in this and the time syntax categories to determine whether any Speech Graffiticonsistent modifications could be made to the interface. However, most of the improvement in this area will likely have to be generated via better help and training. An important additional finding from this work is the scope of general NL syntax deviations. Considering items like movie and theater names as equivalence cla</context>
