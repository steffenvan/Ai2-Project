The current state of dialogue technology has come a long way since its beginning in the 1950s:
dialogue technology now provides interactive service agents, while research explores various
aspects of multimodal and multiparty communication so as to improve natural and social aspects
of dialogue systems. In this workshop, interest is focussed especially on dialogue systems able to
act as Companions, i.e. software agents with advanced human language technology capacities,
able to display and recognise emotion and aspects of personality as well as to interact with a
user, possibly over a long period, learning about their needs and interests, performing services,
entertaining, consoling, and so on. The focus of the workshop is on text and speech aspects of
dialogue with Companions, but topics to be discussed also include the impact of non-dialogue
phenomena (e.g., presence, low-level control and recognition, avatar technology, etc.) on dialogue
and the interaction of other modalities with dialogue.
Dialogue technology has two main historical sources, both still of relevance today: first, the
chatbot tradition going back at least to ELIZA and PARRY and, secondly, the task-driven
knowledge-based system back to at least BASEBALL and SHRDLU, all these examples being
from the late 1960s. The great chatbots of the past, which bear little relationship to the current
rash of Internet products, did have some claim to companionableness of a sort, and e.g. PARRY
had explicit emotion parameters of fear and anger that affected its outputs. The chatbots
sometimes left initiative with the user (like ELIZA which initiated nothing) and sometimes with
the system (like PARRY, who had long paranoid stories to tell if given a chance). The task-based
systems, however, aimed at efficient task completion with little attention paid to the social or
emotional aspects of interaction. The initiative was always with the user and the system was
regarded as a tool or servant with no goal other than to answer or carry out a task as efficiently
it could.
The two kind of systems gave rise to quite different forms of evaluation as well: the chatbots led to
the sophisticated but artificial “Turing Test” environment of the Loebner competition, while the
funded and deployed task-systems — of which the best known were the MIT airline reservation
systems like PEGASUS and JUPITER — were evaluated in competitions in terms of time and
completion of task rates. However, comparison between systems and their performance proved
difficult; no generally applicable and agreed evaluation framework or methodology is available
for the companionable systems we are interested in this workshop. A central question then is
whether it is possible to measure companionship, and if so, whether is it possible to include
some aspects of it in the evaluation of dialogue systems?
Although both the chatbot and task-based traditions began as text-only systems, they were
able to take advantage of the rapid advances in speech technology, and fuse speech and language
research increasingly. However, none of this led to any obvious advance in what is the goal of this
workshop: the exploration of research advances in dialogue systems able to act as Companions.
It seems clear that both early traditions have much to contribute to the goal of a Companion,
and that it cannot be founded exclusively on either alone. Thus the paper by Shaikh et al.
takes the analysis of social behaviour in human Internet chat dialogue data as the starting point
for building a more sophisticated virtual chat agent.
Many advances have been expected and achieved in pursuing the overall goal of a Companions in
recent years, including the increasing sophistication of ASR and language generation and their
integration with NLP and with higher-level issues of emotion and dialogue control. However,
that there still is room for further improvements in these areas is exemplified in the contribution
by Wallis.
iii
Other advances vital to the notion of Companionship have come from more sophisticated
dialogue management models based on representations of the agents’ previous experiences —
such as the work presented by Sieber &amp; Krenn on episodic memory — and/or personalisation
based on the representation of the knowledge about the user, as in the paper by Adam,
Cavedon &amp; Padgham.
Further advances have been made in a range of deployable theories of emotion that can be
connected directly to text and speech, as well as to facial expressions of talking heads as discussed
by Powers et al. The work by Konstantopoulos also discusses the use of emotions, on both
the user and the agent side, in the context of furthering the feeling of personalisation, while
Pulman et al. let the analysis of the emotions of the user guide the dialogue management
process of the agent.
Also, many recent improvement in Companion-like system come from the use of new techniques
of content extraction in dialogue (such as Information Extraction) and, like every other part
of language technology, from the steady advance of machine learning techniques and associated
evaluation methods, as shown in several of the presentations in the workshop.
One of the aims of the workshop is to be a forum for focussed discussion of what it is to
give a convincing and useful illusion of “personality” in a long-term Companion, when that is
advantageous and when not. The paper by Wilks discusses some of these concepts using the
role of the Victorian lady’s Companion as a key metaphor.
The primary aim of the workshop is to explore and discuss promising new methods to design
and evaluate dialogue systems able to act as Companions, as well as to report and review recent
advances in a wide range of Companion-related topics, concentrating on the what the precise
role of language and speech technology is in achieving this. To this end, the first presentation of
the workshop is an invited talk by &apos;Draum on the “Do&apos;s and Don’ts for Software Companions”.
