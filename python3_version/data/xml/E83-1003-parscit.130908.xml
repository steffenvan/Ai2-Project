<bodyText confidence="0.997931818181818">
We present in this article, as a part
of aspectual operation system, a gene-
ration system of iterative expressions
using a set of operators called iterative
operators. In order to execute the itera-
tive operations efficiently, we have
classified previously propositions
denoting a single occurrence of a single
event into three groupes. The definition
of a single event is given recursively.
The classification has been carried out
especially in consideration of the dura-
tive / non-durative character of the
denoted events and also in consideration
of existence / non-existence of a cul-
mination point (or a boundary) in the
events. The operations concerned with
iteration have either the effect of giving
a boundary to an event ( in the case of
a non-bounded event) or of extending an
event through repetitions. The operators
concerned are: N,F .. direct iterative
operators; I,G .. boundary giving opera-
tors; I .. extending operator. There are
direct and indirect operations: the direct
ones change a non-repetitious proposition
into a repetitious one directly, whereas
the indirect ones change it indirectly.
The indirect iteration is indicated with
X. The scope of each operator is not
uniquely definable, though the mutual
relation of the operators can be given
more or less explicitly.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987289672413793">
The system of the iterative opera-
tions, which makes a part of aspectual
operation system, is based on the assump-
tion that the general mechanism of
repetition is language independent and
can be reduced to a small number of
operations, though language expressions
of repetition are different from language
to language. It must be noticed that even
in one language there are usually several
means to express repetitious events. We
know that &amp;quot;il lui cognait la tote contre
le mur&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ii lui a cogn4 deux ou trois
fois la tote contre le mur&amp;quot;, the examples
given by W. Pollak, express the same event.
We have also linguistic means for
iterative expressions on all lin-
guistic levels: morphological,
syntactical, semantic, pragmatic etc.
As the general form of repetition
we use = (Oil in which f is the
whole event, Oia single occurrence
of a single event and* an iteration
indicator. For example:
: (a series of) explosions took
place
03: a single explosion took place
g indefinit number of times
Oi denotes actually a proposition
describing a single event Si. 4sign will
be replaced later by a single or complex
operator or operators, which operate(s)
on 0i.
We hope also to be able to give various
expressions to the same event and for
that purpose we are planning to have
a set of interpretation rules.
The language mainly concerned is
Japanese, but in this article examples
are given in French, in English or in
German.
2 BASIC CONDITION OF THE ITERATION
The iterative aspect is one of
sentential aspect and denotes plural
occurrence of an event or an action. The
iterative aspect concerns therefore
the property of countability. The itera-
tive operations give the iterative aspect
to a proposition and are concerned with
the plurality of occurrences of the event.
As we distinguish count nouns (count
terms) from non-count nouns (mass terms),
we distinguish countable events from non-
countable events, or more precisely,
the events of which the number of occur-
rences is countable and those of which
the number of occurrences is non-coun-
table.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998412">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997775047619048">
As a count noun has a clear boundary,
a countable event also has to have a
clear boundary. Countable events are
for instance: he opens a window; he reads
a book; he kicks a ball etc. Non-countable
events are for instance: he swims; he
sleeps deeply; he runs fast,etc.
Only a countable event can be repeated:
he opens three windows; he kicked the
ball twice,etc. A nn-countable event
can&apos;t be repeated: .fhe sleeps twice.
The distinction of two kinds of events
(and of two kinds of propositions),
which also is called telic-atelic, cyclic-
non-cyclj.c or bounded-non bounded dis-
tinction&apos; is therefore necessary for the
execution of the iterative operations.
It must be useful to give here some
remarks on the terminology.
The terms such as &apos;iterative&apos;, &apos;repeti-
tive&apos;, &apos;frequentative&apos; and &apos;multiplica-
tive&apos; are used very often as synonyms.
However there are some works which
distinguish them one from the other
The term repetitive is used sometimes
to indicate only one repetition and the
term iterative to indicate more than two
repetitions. And sometimes the term
iterative is used for one repetition and
the term frequentative is used for
several repetitions.
We use both of the terms &apos;iterative&apos; and
&apos;repetitive&apos;, (hence &apos;iteration&apos; and
&apos;repetition&apos;)as synonyms. In this article
&apos;repetition&apos; means, in most of cases,
two or more occurrences of a same event.
But in order to prevent a misunderstan-
ding, we rather use the term &apos;iteration&apos;.
A &apos;proposition&apos; denotes an event and it
is a neutral expression in the sense that
the tense, aspect and mode operators
operate on it.

3.1 Regular and irregular iteration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998226181818182">
Two kinds of iterations are distin-
guished: regular and irregular iterations,
i.e. the iterations which correspond to
cardinal count adverbials and the itera-
tions which correspond to frequency
adverb ials.
A regular iteration is defined either by
a regular frequency of the occurrence of
the event, (called &apos;fixed frequency&apos; by
Stump), or by a constant length of
intervals between occurrences.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984445">
3.2 Repeated constituent of the event
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94124809375">
Considering the structure of a
repeated event, we can distinguish
several forms of repetitions, according
as which constituent is affected. If we
say,&amp;quot;She changes her dress several
times a day&amp;quot;, it is the object which is
affected by the repetition.
Using grammatical category-names we can
indicate the repeated constituent as the
following.
Simple repetition
(4) Subj (Pred)*: Mr. Wells is publishing
a novel year by year; L&apos;une apras
l&apos;autre le pilote verifia des chiffres
(Subj PredY1 : People walked across
the lawn; Each boy in the room stood
up and gave his name.
Complex repetition
(5)(Subj(Pred)4)*: Lorsqu&apos;elle venait
avec sa mbre, souvent celle-ci cares-
sait ce vieux pilier central...
((Subj Fred)* )*: Les habitants de ce
quartier repatent toujours:oSi nous
avions un arrtt d&apos;autobus prts d&apos;ici.*
On the actual stage we have no such a
detailed mechanism to be able to diffe-
rentiate the repeated constituent. Nor
dowe consider the differentiation neces-
sary. We treat all these repetitions as
having the type (Subj Predr,(in a more
general form 0i), and we find no incon-
venience doing so.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.757366">
3.3 Repeated phase of the event
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998598">
An event consists of several phases:
the beginning, the middle, the end and
eventually the result and the imminent
phase, i.e. the phase directly preceding
the beginning point.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.987298">
15
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999498">
As for the repetition is concerned only
a phaseincluding a culmination point is
capable of repetition, because the repe-
tition presuppose that the event has a
(real or hypothetical) boundary.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9245766">
(6) (Inchoative): Lorsqu&apos;il arrivait
Mare et Mme van Daan se mettaient a

(Imminent Phase): Trois fois ou

le commissaire avait ete sur le
point de lui appliquer ma main sur
la figure. (Hypothetical culmination
point)
(Resultative)*: Chaque fois que je
vais chez elle, je trouve toute la
maison bien nettoyee.
Like the distinction of the repeated
constituent, the distinction of the
repeated phase is not especially signifi-
cative in the iterative operations.
Besides, if necessary, we can treat each
phase as an independent event: the begin-
ning part 0&apos; of the event 0 can be
considered as an event. Thus, for the
time being, the distinction of phases is
also neglected in the iterative opera-
tions.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.708043">
3.4 Homogeneous iteration and hetero-
geneous iteration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996447714285714">
A homogeneous iteration is an ordinary
iteration of the type(0)&amp;quot;, and a hetero-
geneous iteration is what is called by
Imbs &apos;la r4petition d&apos;alternance&apos;. It is
not the iteration of a simple event but
the iteration of two or more mutually
related events. It has the form:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.683808666666667">

(7) J&apos;allume et peteins une fois par

<bodyText confidence="0.990553222222222">
The most frequent case is the combina-
tion of two events, but the combination
of three events is still possible:
(0&apos;+0&amp;quot;4-0&apos;&amp;quot;).
(8) Depuis une heure il va a la fenetre
tous les trois minutes, s&apos;arrAte un

The combination of more than three
events is not natural.

5 CLASSIFICATION OF BASIC PROPOSI-
TIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.679674052631579">
A sentential aspect is the sythesis
of the aspectual meanings of all consti-
tuents of the sentence.
For the efficient execution of iterative
operations as well as all aspectual
operations we have to classify previously
propositions Oi denoting events S,. For
this classification we take accouht of
durative/non-durative and bounded/non-
bounded characters of events.
The distinguished propositions are:
01 = durative proposition; 02 = accom-
plishment proposition; 03 = momentaneous
(or non-durative) proposition. This clas-
sication is basically identical with
Verkuyl&apos;s. The criteria we have used and
examples of propositions of each groupe
are as the following. (For pragmatic
reason, sentences are given instead of
propositions.)
Criteria
1: the event is represented with an open
interval; satisfies the additivity (or
partitivity) condition; co-occurrence
with durative adverbials such as a yea;
an hour .. Ok; co-occurrence with
momentaneous adverbials such as in five
minutes, at that moment .• No
2: the event is represented with a
closed interval; a culmination point
(or a boundary) is included; if the
culmination point is excluded, it
satisfies the additivity condition,
otherwise .•
&apos;the event can be considered as a
momentaneous one; co-occurrence with
durative adverbials .. No; co-occur-
rence with momentaneous adverbials ..0k
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.924124666666667">

guishes durative VP, terminative VP and
momentaneous VP.

Examples of expressions
1: he sleeps, he sings, he walks
2: he swims across the river, he
reaches the top of the hill, he builds
a sandcastle
3: he hits the ball, a bombe explodes,
he kicks at a ball
This classification is necessary also
for other aspectual operations. In order
to show the varidity of the classifi-
cation, we give an example of other
aspectual operations: the inchoative
operation. Inch is a boundary giving
operator and gives the initial border
to any proposition, but the meaning of
Inch(0i) is different according to Ø.
With 01, which doesn&apos;t imply any boundary,
Inch functions to give the initial boun-
dary.
ex. 01 .. it rains; Inch(01) .. It
begins to rain
With 0,, which implies an end point,
Inch fiXes the initial boundary,
ex. 02 .. Bob builds a sandcastle;
Inch(02) .. Bob began to build a sand-
castle.
The length of the event is the time
stretch, at the end of which Bob is
supposed to complete the sandcastle.
With 03 the condition is quite different.
03, momentaneous proposition, implies no
length (or no meaningful length) and the
beginning point and the end point overlap
each other. Inch(03) gives automatical)y
the iteration of the event and the
initial boundary becoms the initial
boundary of the prolonged event.
ex. 03 .. he knocks (one time) on the
door; Inch(03) .. He began knocking
(repeatedly) on the door.
The function of the Inch is the same for
all of three examples, but the meaning
of the beginning is different one from
another. The third case (that of 03) is
an example of the fact that a non-repe-
titious operator can produce certain
repetitions. This is the repetitious
effect of a non-repetitious operator, to
which we will return later.

6 BASIC OPERATORS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98387965625">
An iterative operation is noted as
R(Ø1), of which Rj is either a single
operator or operators. As it was already
said, a necessary condition of the itera-
tion is that the event in question has
a clear boundary. Thus the operators
concerned with the iterative operations
have either the effect of giving a certain
boundary, (in the case of non-bounded
event): B0i, or the effect of repetition.
The following operators indicated with
capital letters are not individual opera-
tors,but group names. An individual
operator has for instance a form like N2
or F1/w(eek)*
Operators
N: operators indicating directly the num-
ber of repetitions
F: operators indicating a frequency or
regular intervals between occurrences
I: operators indicating a temporal
length; effect of prolonging and
bordering
B: boundary giving operators
G: prolonging operators
Examples of expressions
N: two times, three times, several times
F: every day, three times a week,
several times a day
I: for an hour, from one to three
B: begin to, finish -ing, (teshimau..J)

<bodyText confidence="0.99952975">
The operation of N, F, repetitious
operators, on 02, 03 give as the output
NO2, NO3, F02, FØ. These are direct (ex-
plicit) repetitious operations, namely
those which change a non-repetitious
proposition into a repetitious one. The
result of the operations is exactly what
the operators indicate.

7.1.2 Indirect Operations

<bodyText confidence="0.9989082">
The operator I gives a temporal

It is not a proper repetitious operator.
However, if the operator I operates on 02
or on a bounded proposition, it turns
the prol6osition into that of repeated
event. In this case, the iterative opera-
tion is effectuated indirectly. We call
this iteration &apos;implicative iteration&apos;.
ex. 02 .. John walks to the door;
I .. for hours; 102 .. John walked to
the door for hours.
In order to differentiate this 102 from
101, we use the symbol/for an implicative
iteration: I(X.02). (exactlyZisZ1 or:E2)

As for the strings NO1 and F01, they

some special interpretation rules, how-

F02 respectively.

It is often proposed to distinguish
an event from its background (or its
occasion). The background is a time
stretch in which the event takes place.
From a pure theoretical viewpoint, the
idea of the double structure of event-
background is very helpful for analysis
of ambiguous structures.
ex. La toupie a tourne trois fois.1
In this expression, &apos;trois fois&apos; can be
either the number of occurrences of
the event (i.e. number of spins of the
top) or the number of occasions on which
the top spun. With the iterative operators
the difference can be given clearly: NO3
and N(3:03). In the former case, the top
spun three times on one occasion and in
the latter case, the top spun several
times on three occasions.
The operators N,F,I are related with
both the event and the background.
Graphically the difference can be indi-
cated as the figure 2. 2
1 This example is borrowed from Rohrer.
2 The first graph (NO3) is also borrowed
from Rohrer.

Operationally, if we differentiate the
background from the event on the level of
iterative operations, the rules must be
too complicated. For the time being
the operators N,F, I are used regardless
whether they operate on the event or on
the occasion.
9 NAGATION OF THE ITERATIVE PROPOSITIONS
As for the negative cases of itera-
tive operations, there are several
possibilities. Either a negeted iterative
proposition remains still iterative or it
becomes a non-iterative proposition. In
other words, the negation affects
the whole proposition in the case of total
negation, and affects just the number of
repetitions or the frequency in the case
of partial negation. In the former case
the scope of the nagation is larger than
that of the iteration, and in the latter
case, the scope of the negation is smaller
than that of the iteration.
(23) NO3: Il est venu deux fois
&amp;(NO3) or rather -03: Il n&apos;est
jamais venu. (Total negation)
(-N)03: Il n&apos;est pas venu deux fois.
(En effet, il n&apos;est venu qu&apos;une fois.)
(Partial negation)
N(-03): Ii n&apos;est pas venu deux fois.
Deja deux fois il n&apos;est pas venu.
F03: sortait trois fois par
semaine.
,.(F03) or rather ,03: Ii n&apos;est
Several kinds of interpretation
rules are in view. The interpretation
rules of the first category are those
which give adequate interpretations to
N01, F01 etc, in consideration of the
context on the pragmatic level. NO1 gains
usually an interpretation of NO2, and F01
that of F02. For example, &amp;quot;I walked
three times this week&amp;quot; can be interpreted
as: &amp;quot;I walked three times from the house
to the station this week.&amp;quot;
The second interpretation rules are
concordance rules, which connect diverse
expressions with one same event.
Different expressions in appearence or
different means of expressions are inter-
connected by these rules. Eventually,
the distinction of the background from
the event can be effectuated by certain
rules.

<abstract confidence="0.998835529411765">We present in this article, as a part of aspectual operation system, a generation system of iterative expressions using a set of operators called iterative operators. In order to execute the iterative operations efficiently, we have classified previously propositions denoting a single occurrence of a single event into three groupes. The definition of a single event is given recursively. The classification has been carried out especially in consideration of the durative / non-durative character of the denoted events and also in consideration of existence / non-existence of a culmination point (or a boundary) in the events. The operations concerned with iteration have either the effect of giving a boundary to an event ( in the case of a non-bounded event) or of extending an event through repetitions. The operators concerned are: N,F .. direct iterative operators; I,G .. boundary giving operators; I .. extending operator. There are direct and indirect operations: the direct ones change a non-repetitious proposition into a repetitious one directly, whereas the indirect ones change it indirectly. The indirect iteration is indicated with X. The scope of each operator is not uniquely definable, though the mutual relation of the operators can be given more or less explicitly.</abstract>
