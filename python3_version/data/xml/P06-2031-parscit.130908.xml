We propose a robust method of auto-
matically constructing a bilingual word
sense dictionary from readily available
monolingual ontologies by using esti-
mation-maximization, without any an-
notated training data or manual tuning.
We demonstrate our method on the
English FrameNet and Chinese HowNet
structures. Owing to the robustness of
EM iterations in improving translation
likelihoods, our word sense translation
accuracies are very high, at 82% on av-
erage, for the 11 most ambiguous words
in the English FrameNet with 5 senses
or more. We also carried out a pilot
study on using this automatically gener-
ated bilingual word sense dictionary to
choose the best translation candidates
and show the first significant evidence
that frame semantics are useful for
translation disambiguation. Translation
disambiguation accuracy using frame
semantics is 75%, compared to 15% by
using dictionary glossing only. These
results demonstrate the great potential
for future application of bilingual frame
semantics to machine translation tasks.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999865926829268">
As early as in the 1950s, semantic nets were in-
vented as an “interlingua” for machine transla-
tion.
The “semantic net” or “semantic map” that
humans possess in the cognitive process is a
structure of concept classes and lexicon (Illes and
Francis 1999). In addition, the frame-semantic
representation of predicate-argument relations
has gained much attention in the research com-
munity. The Berkeley FrameNet (Baker et al.
1998) is such an example.
We suggest that in addition to dictionaries, bi-
lingual frame semantics (word sense dictionary)
is a useful resource for lexical selection in the
translation process of a statistical machine trans-
lation system. Manual inspection of the contras-
tive error analysis data from a state-of-the-art
SMT system showed that around 20% of the er-
ror sentences produced could have been avoided
if the correct predicate argument information was
used (Och et al. 2003). Therefore, frame seman-
tics can provide another layer of translation dis-
ambiguation in these systems.
We therefore propose to generate a bilingual
frame semantics mapping (word sense diction-
ary), simulating the “semantic map” in a bilin-
gual speaker. Other questions of interest to us
include how concept classes in English and Chi-
nese break down and map to each other.
This paper is organized as follows. In section
2, we present the one-frame-two-languages idea
of bilingual frame semantics representation. In
section 3, we explain the EM algorithm for gen-
erating a bilingual ontology fully automatically.
In section 4, we present an evaluation on word
sense translation. Section 5 describes an evalua-
tion on how well bilingual frame semantics can
improve translation disambiguation. We then
discuss related work in section 6, conclude in
section 7, and finally discuss future work in sec-
tion 8.

The challenge of translation disambiguation is to
select the target word cl* with the correct seman-
tic frame f--(cl,f), among the multitude of transla-
tion candidates Pr(cljel). We suggest that while a
source word in the input sentence might have
multiple translation candidates, the correct target
word must have the same sense, i.e., belong to
the same semantic frame, as the source word (i.e.
Pr(cl,fjel,f) is high). For example, “burn |烫

(tang)” carries the “cause_harm|damage”
sense, whereas “burn |0 (shao)” carries the
“heat|cooking” sense. The source sentence “My
hands are burned” has the
“cause_harm|damage” sense, therefore the cor-
rect translation of “burn” is “ 烫 (tang)” not
“0(shao)”. The frame semantics information
of the source word can thus lead to the best trans-
lation candidate.
Whereas some translation ambiguities are
preserved over languages, most are not. In par-
ticular, for languages as different as English and
Chinese, there is little overlap between how lexi-
con is broken-down (Ploux and Ji 2003). Some
cognitive scientists suggest that a bilingual
speaker tends to group concepts in a single se-
mantic map and simply attach different words in
English and Chinese to the categories in this
map.
Based on the above, we propose the one-
frame-two-languages idea for constructing a bi-
lingual word sense dictionary from monolingual
ontologies.
FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998) is a collection of
lexical entries grouped by frame semantics. Each
lexical entry represents an individual word sense,
and is associated with semantic roles and some
annotated sentences. Lexical entries with the
same semantic roles are grouped into a “frame”
and the semantic roles are called “frame ele-
ments”. Each frame in FrameNet is a concept
class and a single word sense belongs to only one
frame. However, the Chinese HowNet represents
a hierarchical view of lexical semantics in Chi-
nese.
HowNet (Dong and Dong 2000) is a Chinese
ontology with a graph structure of word senses
called “concepts”, and each concept contains 7
fields including lexical entries in Chinese, Eng-
lish gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and
English, and a definition of the concept including
its category and semantic relations (Dong and
Dong, 2000). Whereas HowNet concepts corre-
spond roughly to FrameNet lexical entries, its
semantic relations do not correspond directly to
FrameNet semantic roles.
A bilingual frame, as shown in Figure 1,
simulates the semantic system of a bilingual
speaker by having lexical items in two languages
attached to the frame.

To choose “burn|烫(tang)” instead of “burn|0
(shao)”in the translation of “My hands are
burned”, we need to know that “烫(tang)”
belongs to the “cause_harm” frame, but “ 0
(shao)” belongs to the “heat” frame. In other
words, we need to have a bilingual frame seman-
tics ontology. Much like a dictionary, this bilin-
gual ontology forms part of the translation
“lexicon”, and can be used either by human
translators or automatic translation systems.
Such a bilingual frame semantics ontology
also provides a simulation of the “concept lexi-
con&amp;quot; of a bilingual person, as suggested by cog-
nitive scientists.
Figure 1 shows an example of a bilingual
frame that possibly corresponds to the semantic
structure in a bilingual person.

We previously proposed using the Chinese
HowNet and a bilingual lexicon to map the Eng-
lish FrameNet into a bilingual BiFrameNet (Fung
and Chen 2004). We used a combination of
frame size thresholding and taxonomy distance
to obtain the final alignment between FrameNet
frames and HowNet categories, to generate the
BiFrameNet.
Our previous algorithm had the disadvantage
of requiring the ad hoc tuning of thresholds. This
results in poor performance on lexical entries
from small frames (i.e. frames with very few
lexical entries). The tuning process also means
that a development set of annotated data is
needed. In this paper, we propose a fully auto-
matic estimation-maximization algorithm in-
stead, to generate a similar FrameNet to HowNet

bilingual ontology, without requiring any anno-
tated data or manual tuning. As such, our method
can be applied to ontologies of any structure, and
is not restricted to FrameNet or HowNet.
Our approach is based on the following as-
sumptions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997901">
1. A source semantic frame is mapped to a tar-
get semantic frame if many word senses in
the two frames translate to each other;
2. A source word sense translates into a target
word sense if their parent frames map to each
other.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957356">
The semantic frame in FrameNet is defined
as a single frame, whereas in HowNet it is de-
fined as the category. The formulae of our pro-
posed algorithm are listed in Figure 2.
In the initialization step of our EM algorithm, all
English words in FrameNet are glossed into Chi-
nese using a bilingual lexicon with uniform
probabilities Pr(cl|el). Next, we apply the EM
algorithm to align FrameNet frames and HowNet
categories. By using EM, we improve the prob-
abilities of frame mapping in Pr(cf|ef) and word
sense translations in Pr(cl,cf|el,ef) iteratively: We
estimate sense translations based on uniform bi-
lingual dictionary probabilities Pr(cl|el) first.
The frame mappings are maximized by using the
estimated sense translation. The a priori lexical
probability Pr(cl) is assumed to be one for all
Chinese words. Underlining the correctness of
our algorithm, we note that the overall likeli-
hoods of the model parameters in our algorithm
improve until convergence after 11 iterations.
We use the alignment output after the conver-
gence step. That is, we obtain all word sense
translations and frame mapping from the EM
algorithm:

The mapping between FrameNet frames and
HowNet categories is obviously not one-to-one
since the two languages are different. The initial
and final mappings before and after EM itera-
tions are shown in Figures 3a,b and 4a,b. Each
point (i,j) in Figures 3a and b represents an
alignment between FrameNet frame i to HowNet
category j. Before EM iterations, each English
lexical item is glossed into its (multiple) Chinese
translations by a bilingual dictionary. The parent
frame of the English lexical item and those of all
its Chinese translations are aligned to form an
initial mapping. This initial mapping shows that
each English FrameNet frame is aligned to an
average of 56 Chinese HowNet categories. This
mapping is clearly noisy. After EM iterations,
each English frame is aligned to 5 Chinese cate-
gories on average, and each Chinese category is
aligned to 1.58 English frames on average.

After EM iterations, the majority of the English

disambiguating between only two senses per

The only susceptibility of our algorithm is in
its reliance on bilingual dictionaries. The sense
translations of the words “tie”, “roll”, and “look”
are relatively less accurate due to the absence of
certain translations in the dictionaries we used.

perform well on lexical entries from small frames
(e.g. on “hold.v” and “issue.v”) due to ad hoc
manual thresholding, the current method is fully
automatic and therefore more robust. In Fung
and Chen (2004), semantic frames are mapped to
each other if their lexical entries translate to each
other above a certain threshold. If the frames are
small and therefore do not contain many lexical
entries, then these frames might not be correctly
mapped. If the parent concept classes are not cor-
rectly mapped, then word sense translation accu-
racy suffers.
The main advantage of our algorithm over our
work in 2004 lies in the hill-climbing iterations
of the EM algorithm. In the proposed algorithm,
all concept classes are mapped with a certain
probability, so no mapping is filtered out prema-
turely. As the algorithm iterates, it is more prob-
able for the correct bilingual word sense to be
translated to each other, and it is also more prob-
able for the bilingual concept classes to be
mapped to each other. After convergence of the
algorithm, the output probabilities are optimal
and the translation results are more accurate.

5 Towards Translation Disambiguation
using Frame Semantics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998839607142857">
As translation disambiguation forms the core of
various machine translation strategies, we are
interested in studying whether the generated bi-
lingual frame semantics can complement existing
resources, such as bilingual dictionaries, for
translation disambiguation.
The semantic frame of the predicate verb and
the argument structures in a sentence can be
identified by the syntactic structure, part-of-
speech tags, head word, and other features in the
sentence. The predicate verb translation corre-
sponds to the word sense translation we de-
scribed in the previous sections, Pr(cl,cf  |el,ef).
We intend to evaluate the effectiveness of bi-
lingual frame semantics mapping in disambiguat-
ing between translation candidates. For the
evaluation set, we use 202 randomly selected
example sentences from FrameNet, which have
been annotated with predicate-argument struc-
tures.
In the first step of the experiment, for each
predicate word (el,ef), we find all its translation
candidates of the predicate word in each sen-
tence, and annotate them with their HowNet
categories to form a translated word sense
Pr(cl,cf|el,ef). For the example sentence in Fig-
ure 6, there are altogether 147 word sense trans-
lations for (hold,detaining).

translation. These methods look at the context
words and discourse surrounding the source
word and use methods ranging from boostrap-
ping (Li &amp; Li 2003), EM iterations (Cao and Li,
2002; Koehn and Knight 2000), and the cohe-
sive relation between the source sentence and
translation candidates (Fung et al. 1999; Kikui
1999).
Our proposed translation disambiguation
method compares favorably to (Li &amp; Li 2003) in
that we obtain an average of 82% precision on
words with multiple senses, whereas they ob-
tained precisions of 80-90% on words with two
senses. Our results also compare favorably to
(Fung et al. 1999; Kikui 1999) as the precision of
our predicate verb in the input sentence transla-
tion disambiguation is about 75% whereas their
precisions range from 40% to 80%, albeit on an
independent set of words.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999609">
Based on the one-frame-two-languages idea,
which stems from the hypothesis of the mind of a
bilingual speaker, we propose automatically gen-
erating a bilingual word sense dictionary or on-
tology. The bilingual ontology is generated from
iteratively estimating and maximizing the prob-
ability of a word translation given frame map-
ping, and that of frame mapping given word
translations. We have shown that for the most
ambiguous 11 words in the English FrameNet,
the average word sense translation accuracy is
82%. Applying the bilingual ontology mapping
to translation disambiguation of predicate verbs
in another evaluation, the accuracy of our
method is at an encouraging 75%, significantly
better than the 15% accuracy of using bilingual
dictionary only. Most importantly, we have dem-
onstrated that bilingual frame semantics is poten-
tially useful for cross-lingual retrieval, machine-
aided and machine translation.

Net has a relatively poor coverage of lexical en-
tries. It would be necessary to apply either semi-
automatic or automatic methods such as those in
(Burchardt et al. 2005, Green et al 2004) to ex-
tend FrameNet coverage for final application to
machine translation tasks. Last but not the least,
we are interested in applying our method to other
ontologies such as the one used for the Propbank
data, as well as to other language pairs.

<abstract confidence="0.999742107142857">We propose a robust method of automatically constructing a bilingual word sense dictionary from readily available monolingual ontologies by using estimation-maximization, without any annotated training data or manual tuning. We demonstrate our method on the English FrameNet and Chinese HowNet structures. Owing to the robustness of EM iterations in improving translation likelihoods, our word sense translation accuracies are very high, at 82% on average, for the 11 most ambiguous words in the English FrameNet with 5 senses or more. We also carried out a pilot study on using this automatically generated bilingual word sense dictionary to choose the best translation candidates and show the first significant evidence that frame semantics are useful for translation disambiguation. Translation disambiguation accuracy using frame semantics is 75%, compared to 15% by using dictionary glossing only. These results demonstrate the great potential for future application of bilingual frame semantics to machine translation tasks.</abstract>

These results demonstrate the great potential for future application of bilingual frame semantics to machine translation tasks. 1 Introduction As early as in the 1950s, semantic nets were invented as an “interlingua” for machine translation. The “semantic net” or “semantic map” that humans possess in the cognitive process is a structure of concept classes and lexicon (Illes and Francis 1999). In addition, the frame-semantic representation of predicate-argument relations has gained much attention in the research community. The Berkeley FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998) is such an example. We suggest that in addition to dictionaries, bilingual frame semantics (word sense dictionary) is a useful resource for lexical selection in the translation process of a statistical machine translation system. Manual inspection of the contrastive error analysis data from a state-of-the-art SMT system showed that around 20% of the error sentences produced could have been avoided if the correct predicate argument information was used (Och et al. 2003). Therefore, frame semantics can provide another layer of translation disambiguation in these systems. We therefore propose to</context>

Whereas some translation ambiguities are preserved over languages, most are not. In particular, for languages as different as English and Chinese, there is little overlap between how lexicon is broken-down (Ploux and Ji 2003). Some cognitive scientists suggest that a bilingual speaker tends to group concepts in a single semantic map and simply attach different words in English and Chinese to the categories in this map. Based on the above, we propose the oneframe-two-languages idea for constructing a bilingual word sense dictionary from monolingual ontologies. FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998) is a collection of lexical entries grouped by frame semantics. Each lexical entry represents an individual word sense, and is associated with semantic roles and some annotated sentences. Lexical entries with the same semantic roles are grouped into a “frame” and the semantic roles are called “frame elements”. Each frame in FrameNet is a concept class and a single word sense belongs to only one frame. However, the Chinese HowNet represents a hierarchical view of lexical semantics in Chinese. HowNet (Dong and Dong 2000) is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure of word senses called “concept</context>

An example bilingual frame We previously proposed using the Chinese HowNet and a bilingual lexicon to map the English FrameNet into a bilingual BiFrameNet (Fung and Chen 2004). We used a combination of frame size thresholding and taxonomy distance to obtain the final alignment between FrameNet frames and HowNet categories, to generate the BiFrameNet. Our previous algorithm had the disadvantage of requiring the ad hoc tuning of thresholds. This results in poor performance on lexical entries from small frames (i.e. frames with very few lexical entries). The tuning process also means that a development set of annotated data is needed.

If the frames are small and therefore do not contain many lexical entries, then these frames might not be correctly mapped. If the parent concept classes are not correctly mapped, then word sense translation accuracy suffers.

Translation disambiguation accuracy using frame semantics is 75%, compared to 15% by using dictionary glossing only. These results demonstrate the great potential for future application of bilingual frame semantics to machine translation tasks. 1 Introduction As early as in the 1950s, semantic nets were invented as an “interlingua” for machine translation. The “semantic net” or “semantic map” that humans possess in the cognitive process is a structure of concept classes and lexicon (Illes and Francis 1999). In addition, the frame-semantic representation of predicate-argument relations has gained much attention in the research community. The Berkeley FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998) is such an example. We suggest that in addition to dictionaries, bilingual frame semantics (word sense dictionary) is a useful resource for lexical selection in the translation process of a statistical machine translation system. Manual inspection of the contrastive error analysis data from a state-of-the-art SMT system showed that around 20% of the error sentences produced could have been avoided if the correct predicat</context>

The source sentence “My hands are burned” has the “cause_harm|damage” sense, therefore the correct translation of “burn” is “ 烫 (tang)” not “0(shao)”. The frame semantics information of the source word can thus lead to the best translation candidate. Whereas some translation ambiguities are preserved over languages, most are not. In particular, for languages as different as English and Chinese, there is little overlap between how lexicon is broken-down (Ploux and Ji 2003). Some cognitive scientists suggest that a bilingual speaker tends to group concepts in a single semantic map and simply attach different words in English and Chinese to the categories in this map. Based on the above, we propose the oneframe-two-languages idea for constructing a bilingual word sense dictionary from monolingual ontologies. FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998) is a collection of lexical entries grouped by frame semantics. Each lexical entry represents an individual word sense, and is associated with semantic roles and some annotated sentences. Lexical entries with the same semantic role</context>

Our results are the first significant evidence of, in addition to bilingual dictionaries, bilingual frame semantics is a useful resource for the translation disambiguation task. 6 Related Work The most relevant previous works include word sense translation and translation disambiguation (Li &amp; Li 2003; Cao &amp; Li 2002; Koehn and Knight 2000; Kikui 1999; Fung et al., 1999), frame semantic induction (Green et al., 2004; Fung &amp; Chen 2004), and bilingual semantic mapping (Fung &amp; Chen 2004; Huang et al. 2004; Ploux &amp; Ji, 2003, Ngai et al., 2002; Palmer &amp; Wu 1995). Other than the English FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998), we also note the construction of the Spanish FrameNet (Subirats &amp; Petruck, 2003), the Japanese FrameNet (Ikeda 1998), and the German FrameNet (Boas, 2002). In terms of learning method, Chen and Palmer (2004) also used EM learning to cluster Chinese verb senses. Word Sense Translation Previous word sense translation methods are based on using context information to improve translation. These methods look at the context words and discourse surrounding the source word and use methods ranging from boostrap</context>
