Beranek and Newman, Jaime Carbonell, Carnegie-
Mellon University, Mitchell Marcus, Bell Labs, Ellen
Prince, University of Pennsylvania, and Ralph Weische-
del, University of Delaware. Local arrangements are
being handled by Jerry Kaplan, Stanford University.
Copies of the proceedings will be available at the time

Registration. Before June 1, 1981, the registration
fee is $25 for members, $40 for non-members, and
$10 for full-time students. After June 1, the fee is $5
higher in each category. The non-member registration
fee includes individual membership in the ACL for
1981 (regular dues: $15). Registration includes a
copy of the conference proceedings. Advance reserva-
tions are required for the conference banquet on Tues-
day evening, at $15 per person.
Dormitory accommodations. A limited number of
single and double rooms with shared bath facilities and
maid service are available on campus in Roble Hall
with advance reservations for the three day period
June 28-30. Reservations should be made by June 10 to
ensure accommodations, although it may still be possi-
ble to obtain them after that time.
The cost for the three-day period is $42.75 for a
single and $32.25 (per person) for a double. Accom-
modations will be available for additional days, subject
to availability, at a daily rate of $14.25 for a single
and $10.75 (per person) for a double. When request-
ing additional days, the particular dates required must
be specified. If no roommate is specified for double
rooms, please indicate whether you are male or female
and smoker or nonsmoker.
Motel accommodations. A list of motels in the area
is available on request.
Directions to Stanford University. The university is
about 25 minutes drive from both the San Francisco
International and the San Jose Municipal Airports.
Take the Bayshore Freeway (Route 101) to the Uni-
versity Avenue exit in Palo Alto. University Avenue
will take you through downtown Palo Alto, and be-
come Palm Drive after crossing over an underpass at
the entrance to the Stanford Campus. At the first
stop sign (not a stop light) after the underpass, turn
right onto Campus Drive. Where Campus Drive ends,
turn left onto Panama Street. Where Panama Street
ends, turn right onto Sam Morris Way, then left onto
Santa Teresa Street. Make an immediate right into
Roble Drive. Roble Hall will be in front of you; Ter-
man Engineering Center will be behind you.
Limousine service ($16.75) is available from both
airports, and Van service ($8.00) is available from San
Francisco; advance reservations are advisable through
Airport Limousine Service, (415) 595-3636. If taking
the Van, get off at the Tressider Memorial Union stop,
a short walk from Roble Hall. The SAMTRANS Ex-
press Airport Bus, #7F, ($0.55) leaves every half hour
from the airport; hourly after 6:25 P.M.
