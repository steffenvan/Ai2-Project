<bodyText confidence="0.984368538461538">
Since its publication in 1985, the outstanding 1,800-page Comprehensive Grammar of the
English Language, by Randolph Quirk, Sidney Greenbaum, Geoffrey Leech, and Jan
Svartvik, has been the definitive description of the grammar of English and an in-
dispensable reference for any research in the analysis or generation of English that
attempts serious coverage of the syntactic phenomena of the language. The new Long-
man Grammar of Spoken and Written English, by Douglas Biber, Stig Johansson, Geoffrey
Leech, Susan Conrad, and Edward Finegan, is an important complement to the earlier
work, extending and sometimes revising the descriptions of Quirk et al., by means of
an extensive corpus analysis by the five authors and their research assistants. Now, the
bookshelf of any researcher in English linguistics is incomplete without both volumes.
Like Quirk et al. (hereafter CGEL), Biber and his colleagues attempt a detailed de-
scription of all the syntactic phenomena of English. But Biber et al. (hereafter LGSWE)
go beyond CGEL in several important ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9962701">
• The work is based on corpus analysis, and there is a strong emphasis on
linguistic function in the interpretation of the quantitative results of the
analysis.
• A central organizing element is the importance of register as a factor in
linguistic choices.
• Spoken, conversational English is treated as equal in standing to written
English.
• The emphasis is much more explicit than in CGEL on the relationships
between discourse factors and language users&apos; syntactic choices and
between those syntactic choices and language users&apos; lexical choices.

<bodyText confidence="0.976265333333333">
The corpus upon which LGSWE is based is the Longman Spoken and Written En-
glish Corpus of 40 million words of British and American English in 37,000 texts. The
corpus includes four main registers: transcribed conversations (6.4 million words),
</bodyText>

fiction (5.0 million words), news (10.7 million words), and academic prose (5.3 mil-
lion words); in addition, there are two supplementary registers: 5.7 million words of
nonconversational speech and 6.9 million words of general prose.
The transcribed conversations are of particular note. British and American infor-
mants surreptitiously tape-recorded all their conversations for a week. (Other partic-
ipants in the conversations were asked post hoc for consent to the use of the con-
versation in the corpus.) Throughout the book, the differences between conversation
and the written registers are treated in detail, and Chapter 14 is devoted to particular
aspects of conversation, such as how the constraints of real-time, interactive language
production influence the language user&apos;s choice of syntactic constructions.
While the more mechanical parts of the corpus analysis were largely automatic
(beginning with part-of-speech tagging), the main analyses were carried out manually
by the authors with the aid of software for searching and manipulating the contents of
the corpus. But manual analysis was also required for many of the relatively low-level
tasks, where semantic judgment was required to determine the function of a linguistic
element. For example, it still requires a human to reliably distinguish instances of the
hedging use of sort of from instances of the regular noun-phrase use (you can sort of
wedge it in; what sort of ideas have you come up with? (p. 36)) and to tease out the semantics
of the genitive in a coordinate construction (we present Berg and Muscat&apos;s definition refers
to just one definition; but Andrew and Horatia&apos;s eyes met refers to two separate pairs of
eyes (p. 298)).
Table 1 lists the titles of the chapters, along with my gloss of the contents of each.
A complete listing of even the first-level subheadings would take much more space.

2. The Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963181818182">
A typical section of LGSWE takes a syntactic phenomenon of English, describing it in
general terms. It is then subcategorized, each subcategory is explained, and a cross-
register corpus analysis of the phenomenon is presented, highlighting its distribution
in each register and the distribution of the subcategories. If the subcategories are
semantic, a corpus analysis is presented of the various possible syntactic realizations of
each. Tables, sometimes quite long, are often given of relevant words and the frequency
of some specific behavior. The results are then discussed qualitatively, emphasizing the
functional aspects of syntactic choice. Constructions are analyzed with respect to the
work or tasks that they perform, their relation to cognitive constraints on language
production, and their social indexing (pp. 41-44). The tasks of linguistic features are
divided into the ideational, textual (serving to mark information structure or textual
cohesion), personal, interpersonal, contextual, and aesthetic. The following quotations
exemplify the style of the analysis:
That-clauses functioning as noun complements are one of the primary
devices used to mark stance in academic prose. (p. 648)
There is a clear stylistic difference between interrogative if-clauses,
which are strongly favored in the more colloquial style of conver-
sation and fiction, and interrogative whether-clauses, which are more
neutral in their stylistic range. (p. 691)
In [academic prose,[ fronting serves to juxtapose items which through
semantic repetition cohesively tie the sentences together. ... Conversa-
tion and fiction, by contrast, strive for greater impact and stylistic

effect, so we find types of fronting which chiefly convey special em-
phasis and contrast—especially fronting of objects but also some front-
ing of predicatives. (p. 910).
At the lexical level, there is a strong emphasis on collocation, which the authors
generalize to the notion of lexical bundles, &amp;quot;sequences of word forms that commonly
go together in natural discourse&amp;quot; (p. 990)—for example, are shown in table, should be
noted that, you want a cup of tea, thank you very much, got nothing to do with. Chapter 13
includes long tables of four- to six-word lexical bundles common in conversation and
academic prose, classified by structure.
The authors adopt a prototype view of word classes in the style of Lakoff (1987,
Chap. 3) (though it is not described in those terms), with classes having core and
peripheral members: &amp;quot;nouns can be more or less &apos;nouny&apos; &amp;quot; (p. 59). Nonetheless, the
authors categorize words as much as they possibly can, introducing novel classes such
as semi-determiners: &amp;quot;determiner-like words which are often described as adjectives
... [but] have no descriptive meaning&amp;quot; (p. 280)—for example, same, other, former, latter.
This varies from CGEL&apos;s analysis, in which the adjectival aspect of such words is
emphasized (e.g., pp. 430-431).
Despite the emphasis on frequency data, there are few actual numbers. In the text
itself, most of the results are given qualitatively, with just occasional, isolated numeric
data points that are usually approximations. For example, the past perfect is compared
with the simple past tense in these three bullet points (p. 469):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9951372">
• The past perfect aspect has accompanying time adverbials a greater
percentage of the time than does the simple past tense.
• Past perfect verb phrases often occur in dependent clauses.
• Taken together, these two factors (time adverbials and dependent
clauses) account for c. 70% of all occurrences of past perfect verb phrases.

<bodyText confidence="0.999405238095238">
(Statistical significance is never noted; the authors promise in the introduction (p. 40)
that anything reported is statistically significant.) Even the tables and figures are rarely
numeric. Most quantitative data are reported as histograms, but the histograms, either
by their small size or by their design (see below), are very low in precision and are
apparently intended only for quick visual impressions.
A representative section is 10.2 (pp. 776ff.), on circumstance adverbials. The first
subsection describes the different semantic categories of these adverbials (place, time,
means, etc). The second subsection gives corpus results on the frequencies of each
of the categories in each of the four registers of the corpus, with discussion of the
functional significance of the findings; for example, &amp;quot;News is particularly concerned
with current events. Time adverbials are therefore commonly used to make clear when
events happened or to give background leading up to the current event&amp;quot; (p. 785). The
next three subsections give the frequencies of different kinds of phrasal and lexical
realizations of each of the semantic categories, including a 2.5-page table of the fre-
quencies in each of the registers of the most common lexical realizations. Differences
between British and American usage are highlighted; for example, a large difference
is found in the choice between relative and absolute references to time in the news
register: yesterday is eight times more common, and this morning is more than twice
as common, in the British news subcorpus than in the American news subcorpus,
whereas names of days of the week are 28 times more frequent in the latter. The next
two subsections look at the frequencies with which the circumstance adverbials occur

in different positions within the sentence and the correlation between their position,
semantic category, and length, and then at the order of occurrence of multiple circum-
stance adverbials within the same sentence. The final subsection, which is almost as
long as all the others together, repeats much of this analysis for clausal realizations of
circumstance, which the authors find to be different enough from phrasal and lexical
realization to warrant a separate presentation of the analysis. In total, this section is
77 pages long.
The authors are generous with the use of examples from the corpus to illustrate
their descriptions. Often, the selection of examples is as large as, or even larger than,
the description itself; for example, Section 10.2.1.2, on circumstance adverbials of time,
consists of five sentences by the authors and 14 example sentences from the corpus.
And as anyone who has worked with corpora knows, it is sometimes hard to avoid the
distraction of reading the data for its own sake; similarly, in LGSWE, it&apos;s easy to start
skipping over the authors&apos; text in order to hurry to the next example. One suspects
the authors of having sometimes deliberately chosen the most enticing examples from
the corpus to illustrate each point; I got particularly hung up trying to construct a
story around one example on page 809:
One day I left the Yale on the latch accidentally, and when I came back
I found a brand-new shelf, with a brass rod below it, high up in the
shallow recess beside the fire.
Other examples highlight the drama of daily life (pp. 1104, 746, 1119):

3. Empiricism versus prescriptivism
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999817583333333">
Since many lay readers of LGSWE will turn to the book for guidance in &amp;quot;correct
English,&amp;quot; the authors are careful to emphasize that their work is descriptive, not pre-
scriptive. Of course, this is not to say that the book is not of use as a guide for those
who are uncertain in their usage; any writer who wants to ensure that his or her
usage is in accord with English norms, be they prescriptive or statistical, will find
it extremely helpful. For example, the section on verb concord with existential there
(p. 186) spends some time discussing the fact that the prescriptively deprecated use
of a singular verb followed by a plural noun phrase (There&apos;s apples if you want one) is
actually more common in conversation than the prescriptively approved form (There
are apples . . .). But there is less emphasis than in CGEL on the identification of prescrip-
tively deprecated or stigmatized forms. Indeed, whenever prescriptivism is mentioned
in LGSWE, a certain tension arises. For example, the section on dangling participles

(p. 829) first mentions the prescriptivist proscription of such participles as if preparing
to discard it, but then concedes that violation of the rule can lead to absurd interpreta-
tions; and the examples offered are constructed rather than selected from the corpus,
implying that none were found in the corpus and hence that dangling participles have
no part in even a purely descriptive grammar. (The section closes with some corpus
examples of unattached participles that don&apos;t &amp;quot;dangle&amp;quot; in the proscribed manner.) In
another round of prescriptivism-bashing on pages 83-84, we read:
There is a well-known prescriptive reaction against beginning an
orthographic sentence with a coordinator [such as but]. Neverthe-
less, in actual texts, we quite frequently find coordinators in this posi-
tion. . .. The prescription against initial coordinators seems most influ-
ential in academic prose. The higher frequencies in fiction and news
reportage probably reflect the fact that these registers often include
more spontaneous discourse, including fiction dialogue and quoted
speech in news, evidencing the lack of attention to prescriptive rules
of ordinary speech.
But while plausible, this is just speculation, and is not in keeping with the authors&apos;
own stated goal of explaining their corpus observations in terms of linguistic function;
it simply cannot be determined from the corpus data whether or not prescriptivism
influences the observed tendency of academic writers to avoid sentence-initial coordi-
nators. (It certainly didn&apos;t influence my writing of the previous sentence.1)

LGSWE far exceeds CGEL in the quality of its index, which was prepared by Meg
Davies. The authors have learned from the problems of CGEL&apos;s enormous index (by
David Crystal), which, while very comprehensive, frustrates the user by being very
sparing with its subheadings. It is not unusual for a single CGEL index entry or
subentry to list more than 50 locators without differentiation; moreover, the locators
are paragraph numbers, not page numbers, although the design of the book makes
it hard to find the paragraph numbers when flipping pages. By contrast, the index
of LGSWE uses descriptive subheadings for every small group of locators—and the
locators are page numbers. In addition, the lexical index is separate from the conceptual
index, which also adds to ease of use.
LGSWE is an attractive, well-designed, and well-typeset book. I noticed no sig-
nificant typos or errors of copyediting. But I must admit to being both mystified and
somewhat annoyed by the histograms. Five different styles are used, all of them low
in resolution: cumulative vertical bars, adjacent vertical bars, horizontal bars of a few
discrete lengths, horizontal rows of squares, and horizontal rows of circles. The ver-
tical styles require the reader to distinguish up to six shades of grey. The horizontal
styles have no scale, but rather a legend such as &amp;quot;eachu represents 5%,&amp;quot; so that one
has to count the squares or circles. Confusingly, the style chosen for any particular
histogram seems often to be random and unrelated to either the nature of the data
shown or the logic of the display. For example, Tables 5.26-28 (pp. 432-3) show the
distribution across registers of various forms of do; the first two tables use horizontal

squares, but the third uses horizontal circles. And then Table 5.31 (p. 437) shows similar
data—frequencies of common copular verbs across registers—by means of terms such
as &amp;quot;rare&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;relatively common&amp;quot;: a verbal histogram! A similarly disparate group
appears on page 784: Figure 10.4 shows the raw frequencies of semantic categories
of circumstance adverbials across the registers as cumulative vertical bars, whereas
Figure 10.5, immediately adjacent, shows the percentage data for one subcategory of
these adverbials as adjacent vertical bars, and Table 10.3, just below, shows similar
data for a different subcategory as horizontal rows of squares. (Moreover, Table 10.3
is captioned in quite different terms from Figure 10.5, although the two are in fact
logically parallel.) I spent a while puzzling over what the difference was supposed
to be in meaning, implication, or function between all these styles, but finally had to
conclude that there was none.
The book seems to be well bound, and comes in a slipcase to help protect it.
Again, this contrasts with CGEL, whose binding was inadequate for heavy use of a
heavy book; my copy fell part after five or six years of repeated use and loans to
students with backpacks, and had to be re-bound.
The publicity brochure that came with the review copy of LGSWE gave its price as
£69.00, but as this review is written, the price given on the Longman Web site is £72.45;
Amazon lists it for $119 (and CGEL for $247). This is not expensive for an academic
book, especially one of this size and one in which the publisher has invested so much
in resources, but it is sufficient to keep it out of reach of many students and others
who would benefit from owning their own copy. By contrast, the hardback edition of
the 1670-page Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (third edition with CD-ROM)
is only £20.88 ($39 at Amazon).

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999723416666667">
Despite its size and all the work that went into it, LGSWE is not a replacement for
CGEL but rather a complement to it; indeed, the authors explicitly describe it as such
(p. viii). In particular, the descriptions of English grammar in CGEL are perhaps twice
as extensive as those of LGSWE. (CGEL is about 1.5 times larger than LGSWE, and yet
has far fewer examples and no corpus analyses.) This is not to say that LGSWE doesn&apos;t
stand on its own. It does, and for many people, it is the only book of English grammar
that they need. In fact, many students will get by just fine with one of the many less-
detailed and more-concise books available, such as those of Wardhaugh (1995), Baker
(1995), Greenbaum (1996), or McCawley (1998) or the student abridgement of CGEL
(Greenbaum and Quirk 1990). But the most serious users, including many readers of
this journal, will now wish to consult both LGSWE and CGEL on any question of the
more subtle aspects of English grammar and lexis.
