The members and Executive Committee of the Association will
soon have to choose among limiting the scope of the Journal,
making its content more compact and its content more con-
cise, or increasing dues. The production budget allows for
no more than 20 fiches per year. The rate of arrIval of ac-
ceptable manuscripts and news that&apos;s fit to print is going
above the level that can be accommodated in that budget.
Members who prefer one of the three recognized courses of
action, or who have another to propose, can write to the
Editor, the President, or any member of the Editorial Board
or Executive Committee.
AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS is published
by the Center for Applied Linguistics for the Association
for Computational Linguistics.

GENERAL INFORMATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978319217391304">
The 45th Summer Linguistic Institute of the Linguistic Society of
America is being hosted by the State University of New York at its Oswego
campus. The institute has traditionally offered courses In particular
aspects of linguistics which are not readily available to students and
faculty on their home campuses.
The Institute focusing on two major themes, &amp;quot;Language Variation In
America,&amp;quot; In keeping with the bicentennial year, and -Language Univer-
sals and Typology,&amp;quot; will include courses, lectures and seminars on these
themes by Internationally known scholars
The Institute curriculum has been designed specifically to emphasize
Important current developments In the discipline, the mutual contributions
of linguistics and related disciplines to one another, and tne com-
munication of these contributions to linguists and nonlinguists alike.
Courses will meet Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday for one hour
and 15 minutes unless otherwise specified. An additional 1 and 1/4 hours
per week Isle be arranged in consultation with the instructor. Please con-
sult the Institute final brochure for course descriptions and prereouisites.
Students who register for a course numbered 500 or above mutt be
graduate students and prepared to do independent research in addition to
following regular classroom work. Seniors may by petition to the
Graduate Dean, be admitted to courses at the 500 level if they fulfill.the
prerequisites, and show that they are capable of work at the graduate
level.

COURSE OFFERINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998638576923077">
The division of the 8-week period
into units of 2 weeks and 6 weeks
is designed to give linguists and
nonlinguists an opportunity to ob-
tain a structured sequence of
courses outside their particular
area of specialization. A 2-week
intensive introductory course will
be followed by 6-week courses in
areas of interest to both linguists
and nonlinguists. At the same
time that students from other
fields pursue the 2-week Intensive
Introduction to Linguistics,
linguists can also take advantage
of courses in Interdisciplinary
topics Basic and advanced
linguistics courses will be offered
as 4-week and 8-week courses.
Courses listing only language
requirements or introductory
courses as prerequisites, and
those without prerequisites, will
be open to advanced un-
dergraduate as well as to
graduate students.

Courses include undergraduate arid graduate offerings. In order to most
effectively offer courses for linguists, and for teachers and scholars out-
side the field of linguistics, the Institute will offer 2-week, 4-week, 6-week
and 8-week courses.
Full-time student participants will register for 8 o 9 credits Some typical
combinations might include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9769538">
(1) two 8-week courses
(2) one 2-week intensive and two 6-week courses
(3) one 2-week intensive course, one 6-week and one 8-week course
(4) one 4-week Intensive course. one 4-week course, and one 6-week
course
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9953915">
No one may, however, register for more than one intensive course nor
obtain more than 9 semester hours of credit. Language arts teachers and
professional people in other fields are encouraged to take advantage of
the 2-week plus 6-week structured sequence. Linguists are also en-
couraged to explore related fields while pursuing more specialized in-
terests in linguistics.

SUMMARY

<bodyText confidence="0.999442">
The IBM 7040/44 computer program described in this Memorandum
is capable of applying a grammar consisting of unusually
powerful rules to sentences in a natural language so as to
discover their underlying structures All solutions allowed
by the grammar are found The Memorandum discusses the nota-
tion used to write rules and the extent to which they can be
made to state the same linguistic facts as a transformational
grammar.

Any but the most rudimentary tasks in automatic
language processing necessarily involve a procedure which
makes the grammatical structure of sehtences explicit and,
discovers grammatical ambiguities. Most existing programs
are capable of applying context-free phrase-structure
grammars to the sentences and the various techniques for
doing this arc, by now, fairly well understood. However,
this kind of grammar is now generally considered td be
inadequate because it fails to reveal the most important
properties of the majority of sentences and because it
typically declares a sentence to be more ambiguous than
it really is. These difficulties are overcome to some
extent by context-sensitive grammars and to a large extent
by transformational grammars. The program discussed in
this Memorandum is capable of analyzing sentences with
context-sensitive grammars and with grammars of a class
very similar to that of transformational grammars.
Experimentation with this program is still in its very
early stages, but the results reported here suggest that
the technique used may prove to be a powerful and efficient
tool for language analysis. If so, it can hope to find
application in informational retrieval, command and
control, intelligence analysis and many other areas.
AJCL will reprint from time to time contributions recognized
to have signal importance in the history of computational
linguistics and continuing value to students and practitioners.

and delivers as output dll the strings that can he derived
from members of the initial family ;.)y means.of the rules
provided. A suhsidiary mechanism deals with the relation
of dominance in the sena° colnon in linguistics. This
makes it nossible for rules to refer to conlacte or martial
syntactic structures, or P-marhers, an that the program
can he used, at least to some extent, for transformational
analysis.
A progtam of this kine, which is intended for
analyzing natural languages, must 1)e ca:w6le of operation
on a family of strings as a single unit because of the
grammatical ambiguity of words. Take, for examrTe, the
famous sentence &amp;quot;Tire flies like an arrow.&amp;quot; Thee five
words are not, themselves, the orimary data on which a
parsing program can be ex,ected to operate. Instead,
each word is replaced by one or more symbols representing
the grammatical categories to which it belongs. The
assignments for this example might be somewhat as follows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.907665125">
Word grammatical category
Time Noun, verb, adjective
flies Plural noun, 3rd person verb
like Singular noun, preposition,
verb
an Indefinite article
arrow Singular noun, adjective.

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.905936368421053">
Taking one category symhol for each word, it in possible
to form 36 different ntrings, preserving tbe order of the
original sentence. These 36 strinqn constitute the family
on which the program would crernte if set to annlyze this
sentenoe.
The program is said to perform as a non-deterministic
device because, whenever two mutually incompatihle rules
are applicable to the same string, neither is givrn any
priority; both are al,plied, and the osulting strines
developed independently. !liven the string &amp;quot;A B C&amp;quot; and
the rules
n Y
13 C---Z
the program will therefore produce two new string.s:
Y C
A Z
The program contains no mechanism for guarding
against sec:uences of rules which do not terminate. If
the grammar contains the following rules

and the string to be parsed contains either &amp;quot;A B&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;B
A&amp;quot;, then the program will continue substituting these
sub-strings for one another until the space available for
intermediate results is exhausted. This may not seem to
present any particularly severe problem because a pair
27
of rules such as these would never ap ear in any properly
constructed grammar. But, as we shall shortly see,
entirely mlausible grammars can be constructed for which
this problem does arise.

In order to get a general idea of the capabilities
of the program, it will be useful first to consider the
notAtion used fOr presenting rules to it and the way this
is interpreted by the machine. In what follows, we shall
assume that the reader is familiar with the terminology
and usual conventions of phrase-structure and
transformational grammar. An example of the simplest
kind of rewritl rule is
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.783648">
VPRSG = PRES SG VEPB
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999698875">
The &amp;quot;equals&amp;quot; sign is used in place of the more familiar
arrow to separate the left and right-hand sides of the
rule. The symbols on which the rules operate are words
consisting of between one and sisx alphabetic characters.
The above rule will replace the symbol &amp;quot;VPRSG&amp;quot; by a string
of three symbols &amp;quot;PES sr. mul&amp;quot; whenever it occurs. The
following rule will invert the order of the symbols &amp;quot;VERB&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;ING&amp;quot;
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.757081" genericHeader="method">
VERB ING = ING VERB
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975675">
The simplest way to represent a context free phrase
structure rule is as in the following example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8128005">
NP AUX VP = S
28
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999739230769231">
Notice that the normal order of the left and right-hand
sides of the rule is reversed because the recognition
process consists in rewriting strings as single sym)iols;
the rules must therefore take the form of reductions
rather than productions.
The program will accept phrase structure rules in
the form we have shown, but, in applying them, it will
not keep a record of the total sentence structure to which
they contribute. In other words, it will cause a now
string to be constructed, but will not relate this string
in any way to the string which was rewritten. One ,.ey
to cause this relationship to be preserved iF to •:rite
the rule in the following form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.969921">
NP.1 AUX.2 VP.3 = S(1 2 3)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.951742782608696">
The numbers following the syllbols on the left-hand side
of the rule function very much like the numbers frecuently
associated with structural indices in transformational
rules. Uhen the left-hand side of tho rule is found to
match a particular sub-string, tha as3ociot.10 ith
a given symbol in the rule becomes a ointer to, or a
temporary name for, that s7ml&apos;ol. with this interpro.tltion,
the loft-hand side of the above rule can be read sore what
as follows &amp;quot;Find an NP and call it 1; find an AUX following
this and call it 2; findiaLVP following this and call it
3.&amp;quot;
The numbers in parentheses after a symbol on the
right-hand side of a rule are pointers to items identified
by the left-hand side, and which the new symbol must
dominate. In the example, the symbol &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; is to dominate
all the symbols mentioned on the left-.1and side.
29
A pointer nay refer to a 3incle synbol, as we have
Shown, or to a string of synbols. he following rule is
equivalent to the one just described:
7WX.1 VP.1 = S(1)
Furthermore, the string to which a ,)ointer refers need
not be continuous. Consider the followinc: enample
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.976691">
1,11..1 AUX VP.1 = 5(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9946056">
This will cause any string &amp;quot;NP AUX VP&amp;quot; to be rewritten
as &amp;quot;S,&amp;quot; but the &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; will dominate only &amp;quot;UP&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;VP.&amp;quot;
There will be no evidence of the intervening &amp;quot;AUX&amp;quot; in the
final P-marker which will contain the following 2hrase:
Consider now the following nair of rules:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.884959666666667">
A.1 B.2 C.1 D.2 = P(1) 02)
P.1 Q.1 = S(1)
30
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99648792">
If these rules are wpplica to the string &amp;quot;A B C D&amp;quot; the
following P-marker will be formed:
Notice that the first rule in the pair not only re-orders
the symbols in the P-marker but forms two phrz,sas
aimultaneously.
A different way of using pointer numbers on the
right-hand side can be illustrated by comparing the effects
of the following two rules:
N.1 SG.1 V.2 Sc1.3 = TIOU/1(1) V(2) SC(3)
N.I SG.1 V.2 SG.2 = N0UN(1) 2
What is required, we assume, is a context sensitive phrase-
structure rule which will rewrite &amp;quot;F Sr&apos; as &amp;quot;nouN&amp;quot; in the
environment before &amp;quot;V SG&amp;quot;. The first rule achieves this
effect but also introduces a new &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; dominating the old
one, and a new &amp;quot;SG&amp;quot;. The second rule does what is really
wanted: It constructs a phrase labeled &amp;quot;NOUU&amp;quot; as recuired,
and leaves the symbols referred to by pointer number 2
unchanged.
The context-sensitive rule just considered is
presumably intended to insure that singular verbs have
only singular subjects. A second rule in which &apos;SG&amp;quot; is
replaCed by &amp;quot;PL&amp;quot; would be required for plural verbs.
But, since agreements of this kind may Well have to be
specified in other parts of the grammar, the situation.
might better be described by the following three rules:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9024945">
31
Sr1.1 = Nulf1)
PL..]. = Nur(1)
N.1 NW.2 V.3 2 = N0uN(1 2) 3 2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994586458333333">
The first two rules introduce a node labeled &amp;quot;MTN&amp;quot; into
the strectwre above the singular and plural morphemes.
The third rule checks for agreement and forms the subject
noun phrase. Pointer number 2 is associated with the
symbol &amp;quot;NUM&amp;quot; in the second place on the left-hand side,
and occurs by itself in the fourth place. This means
that the fourth syrUol retched by the rule rust be &amp;quot;NUM&amp;quot;,
and also that it must dominate eNactly the same sub-tree
as the second. In the example we are assuming that &amp;quot;Num&amp;quot;
governs a single node ,;!hich will be labeled either &apos;Sr.
or &amp;quot;PL&amp;quot; and the rule will ensure that whichever of these
is dominated by the first occurrence of &amp;quot;NU&apos;&amp;quot; will also
be dominated by the second occurrence. Notice that noun
and verb phrases could be formed lirultaneously by the
following rule:
N.1 NU?&amp;quot;.2 V.3 2 = 10UN(1 2) VERT1(3 2)
The symbols &amp;quot;ANY&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;NULL&amp;quot; are treated in a special
way by this program and should not occur in strings to
be analyzed. The use of the symbol &amp;quot;NULL&amp;quot; is illustrated
in the rule;
PPH = NULL
This will cause the symbol &amp;quot;PPH&amp;quot; to be deleted from any
string in which occurs. The program is nondeterministic
in its treatment of rules of this kind, as elsewhere, so
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.538936">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9821515625">
that it will consie,er analyses in whicli the symbol is
deleted, as well as any wqich can be pade by retaining
it. The symbol &amp;quot;MULL&amp;quot; is used only on the right-hand
sides of rules.
The symbol &amp;quot;ANY&amp;quot; is used only on the loft-hand sides
of rules and has the property that the word implies,
namely that it will match any symbol in a string. The
use of this special symbol is illustrated in the following
rule:
vErn.1 ?\NV.1 NP.1 = VP (1)
This will form a verb phrase from a Verb and a noun phrase,
with one intervening word or 7hrase, /hose crrammatical
category is irrelevant.
Elements on the left-hand sides of rules can be
specified as optional by writing a dollar sign to the
left or right of the symbol as in the_ following rules:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9374435">
DET.1 ADJS.&apos; :,0177.1 = :IP(1)
VERD.1 .$ANY.1 NP.1 = VP(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998957222222222">
The first of these forms a noun phrase from a deterNiner
and a noun, with or without an intervening adjective.
The second is a new version of a rule already considered.
A verb phrase- is formed from a verb and a noun phrase,
with or without an intervening word or phrase of some
other type.
Elements can also be specified as repeatable by
writing an asterisk against the symbol, as in the following
example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5919835">
VERB.&apos; *NP.1 = VP(1)
33
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975458">
This says that a verb 1,hrase nay consist of a verb followed
by one or more noun phrases. It is often convenient to
be able to specify that a given clement may occur zero
or more times. This is Cone in the obvious way by combining
the dollar sign and the asteris% as in the following rule:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.778324">
$DHT.1 *$ADJ.1 N.1 *PP$.1 = NP(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859625">
According to this, a noun may constitute a noun phrase
by itself. However the noun may be preceded by a determiner
and any number of adjectives, and followed by a
prepositional phrase, and all of nese will be embraced
by the new noun phrase that is formed. Notice that the
asterisk and the dollar sign can be placed before or after-
the symbol they refer to. The combination is often useful
with symbol &apos;ANY&amp;quot; in rules of the following kind
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.555151">
N.1 NUM.2 *$ANY.3 V.4 2 = Nour(1 21 3 VERS(4 2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981925">
This i similar to an earlier example. It combines the
number morpheme with a subject noun and with a verb,
provided that the two agree, and allows for any number
of other symbols to intervene. The symbol &amp;quot;ANY&amp;quot; with an
asterisk and a dollar sign corresponds in this system to
the so called variables in the familiar notation oF
transformational grammar.
Consider now the following rule:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.752124">
SCONJ.1 NP(S).1 = NP(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999212">
This will form a noun phrase from a slibordinating
conjunction followed by a noun phrase, provided that this
dominates only the symbol &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;. Any symbol on the left-
hand side of the rule may be followed by an expression
in parentheses specifying the stning of charaoters that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.476912">
34
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99850065625">
this symbol must directly dominate. This expression is
constructed exactly li%e the left-hand sides of rules.
In particular, it may contain symbols followed by
expressions in parentheses. The following rule will serve
as an illustration of this, and of another new feature:
NP($DET.1 $*ANY.1 ADJ(PrPT1T.2) $*AMY.3 N.4
$ PP.5) = 1 3 4 WH DEP 4 nr ADJ((2)) 5
This rule calls for a noun phrase consisting of a noun,
a preceding adjective which dominates a pre-ent participle
and, optionally, a number of other elements. This noun
phrase is replaced by the determiner from the Original
noun phrase, if there is one, the elements preceding the
noun except for the present 1artici2le, the noun itself,
the symbol &amp;quot;UH&amp;quot;, the symbol &amp;quot;DE?&amp;quot;, another cony of the
noun, the symbol &amp;quot;BE&amp;quot;, the symbol &amp;quot;ADJ&amp;quot; dominating exactly
those elements originally dominated by &amp;quot;PPPRT&amp;quot; and,
finally, any following prepositional phrases the original
noun phrase may have contained. The number &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; in double
parentheses following &amp;quot;ADJ&amp;quot; on the right-hand side of
this rule specifies that this symbol is to dominate, not
the present participle itself, but tle elements, if any,
that it dominates. This device turns out to have wide
utility.
Double parentheses can also be used following a
symbol on the left-hand side of a rule, but with a different
interpretation. We have seen how single parentheses are
used to specify the string immediately dominated by a
given symbol. Double parentheses enclose a string which
must be a proper analysis of the, sub-tree dominated by
the given symbol. A string is said to be a proper analysis
of a sub-tree if each terminal symbol of the sub-tree is
dominated by some member of the string. As usual, a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.535804">
35
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.986498578947368">
symbol is taken to dominate itself. As an example of
this, consider the following rule:
ART.1 S((PRT 11.2 ANY*)).1 2 = DIT(l) 2
This rule applies to a string consisting of an article,
a sentence, and a noun. The sentence must be analysable,
at some level, as an article followed by a noun, followed
by at least one other word or phrase. The noun in the
embedded sentence, and the sub-tree it dominates, must
be exactly matched by the noun corgespondina to the last
element on the left-hand side of the rule. The initial
article and the embedded sentence will be collected as a
phrase under the symbol &amp;quot;RFT&amp;quot; and the final noun wt11 be
left unchanged.
The principal facilities available for writing rules
have now been exemplified. Another kind of rule is also
available which has a left-hand side like those already
desoMbed but no &amp;quot;equals&amp;quot; sign and no right-hand side.
However it will be in the best interests of clarity to
defer an explanation of how these rules are interpreted.
The user of the program may write rules in exactly
the form we have described or may add information to
control the order in which the rules are applied. This
additional information takes tfie form of an expression
written before the rule and separated from it by a comma.
This expression, in its turn, takes one of the following
forms:
36
01 in an integer which orders this rule relative to the
others. Since the same integer can be assigned to more
than one rule, the ordering is partial. Ilules to which
no number is explicitly assigned are given the number 0
by the program. n2 and n3, when present, are interpreted
as follows: Every symbol in the suk-sing matched by
the left-hand side of the rule must have been produced
by a rule with number i, where n2&gt;i&gt;n3. For these purposes
the symbols in the oriainal family of strings offered for
analysis are treated as though they had been produced by
a rule with number 0.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998775">
It will be clear from what has been said already
that this program is an exceedingly powerful device capable
of operating on strings and trees in a wide variety of
ways. It would clearly be entirely adequate for analyzing
sentences with a context-free phrase-structure grammar.
But this problem has been solved before, and much more
simply. We have seen how the notation can be used to
write context-sensitive rules, and we should therefore
expect the program to be able to analyze sentences with
a context-sensitive grammar. However in the design of
parsing algorithms, as elsewhere, context-sensitive
grammars turn out to be surprisingly more complicated
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.67446">
37

<table confidence="0.8504457">
than context-free grammars.
The problem that context-sensitive grammars pose
for this program can be shown with a nimple example)

This grammar, though trivial, is well behaved in all
important ways. The language generated, though regular
and unambiguous, is infinite.
Furthermore, every rule is useful for some derivation.
Since the language generated is unambiguous, the grammar
is necessarily cycle-free, in other words, it produces
no derivation in which the same line occurs more than
once. Suppose, however, that the grammar is used for
analysis and is presented with the string &amp;quot;A D E&amp;quot; -- not
a sentence of the language. The attempt to analyze this
string using rules of tne grammar results in a rewriting
operation that begins as follows and continues indefinitely:

etc.
It would clearly be possible, in principal, to eqmip
the program with a procedure for detecting cycles of this
sort, but the time rdquired by such a procedure, and the
complexity that it would introduce into the nrogram as a
whole, are sufficient to rule it out of all practical
consideration. It might be argued that the strings which
have to be analyzed in practical situations come from
real texts and can be assumed to be sentences. The problem
of distinguishing sentences from nonsentences is of
academic interest. But, in natural languages, the
assignment of words to grammatical categories is, as we
have already remarked, notoriously ambiguous and for this
problem to arise it is enough for suitably ambiguous words
to come together in the sentence. A sentence which would
be accepted by the above grammar, but which would also
give rise to cycles in the analysis, might consist of
words with the following grammatical categories:

can include sone special rules in his grammar which will
prevent them from occurring. These rules, which we have
already eluded to, are formally similar to all others
except that they contain no &amp;quot;equals&amp;quot; sign and no right-
hand side. When a P-marker is found to contain a string
which matches the left-hand side of one of these rules,
the program arranges that, thence forward, no other rule
shall be allowed to apply to the whole string. The cycle
in this latest example could not occur if the grammar
contained the rule:

3. TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982714285714">
We now come to the main concern of this paper which
is to discuss the extent to which the program we have
been describing can be made to function as a
transformational analyzer. The main purpose of the
examples that have been given is to show the great power
of the program as a processor of symbol strings. The
notion of dominance is provided for, but only in a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.378943">

<bodyText confidence="0.999963558823529">
rudimentary way. It certainly could not he claimed that
the program is a tree :)rocessor in any really workable
sense. But grammatical transformations are operations
on trees and our investigation therefore must take the
forh of showing that these operations can frequently, if
not always, be mimicked by string rewriting rules.
We shall take it that a transformational grammar
consists of a context-Eree or context-sensitive phrase-
structure component and a set of transformations ordered
in some way. To begin with, very little will t,e lost if
we assume that the transformational rules are simply
ordered.
Consider now the first transformation in the list.
In general, this may he expected to introduce phrases
into the P-markers to which it applies which could not
have been generated by the phrase-structure component.
Let us now write some additional phrase-structure rules
capable of generating these new phrases. Let us insert
these rules into the grammar immediately following the
first transformational rule and establish the convention
that, when they are used in the analysis ef the string,
their output will be used only as input to the first
transformation. Now treat the second transformational
rule in the same way. It also can be expected to create
new kinds of phrase and phrase-structure rules can be
written which would recognize these. It may be that some
of the phrases formed by the second rule could also he
formed by the first, and in this case, it may be possible
to move,the appropriate rule from its position after the
first transformation to a position after the second and
to mark it as providing input only for these two rules.
Notice that the rules we are proposing to construct
will not constitute what has sometimes been called a
surface grammar. The phrases they describe certainly do
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.81395">
41
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999738875">
not belong to the bane structure and many of them may not
be capable of surviving unshanged into the surface
ntructure. In general those rules clescrie 1:°1rases which
can only have transitory existence somewhere in the
generative nrocess. Notice also that in order to describe
these phrases adequately it may sometimes be necessary
to extend the notion of phrase structure grammar somewhat.
Consider for example the following transformation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.928839">
X -A-B- Y
1 2 3 4
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9892681">
Adjoin 2 as right daughter of 3
If we make the sual assumption that a rule is applied
repeatedly until no proper analyses of the P-marker renain
which can be matched by its structural index, then this
transformation, and many others, may ?roduce phrases of
indefinitely many types. Let us supoose that, before
this transformation is applied for the first time, all
possible phrases that can be dominated by the symbol &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;
are describable by context free phrase structure rules
of the following form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5006495">

Illerethect.are any strinqs. The phrase structure grammar
needed to describe all the phrases thot can exist after
the operation of this transformation oust contain the
following rules, or more aceurately ruin schemata
where the asterisk indicates one or rore repetitions of
the symbol &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;. If the left and right-hand sides of these
rules are reversed and they are presented to the program
in the proper notation, then the transformation itself
can be represented by the foilowing pair of rules:
B(*$ANY.1 *A.2) = 2 B+ 1 +B
B+ 13.1 +B = 1
Since there are no facilities for specifying dominance
relations among elements on the right-hand sides of these
rules, it is necessary to resort to subterfuge. The
phrase dominated by the symbol &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; is reproduced in the
output of this rule with copies of the symbol &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; removed
from the right-hand end and the remainder bounded by the
symbols &amp;quot;B+&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;4-8&amp;quot;. These symbols serve to delimit a
part of the string which can only figure in the complete
analysis of the sentence if it constitutes a phrase of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.822893">
43
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999279777777778">
type &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;. The second rule removes these boundary symbols
from the phrase of type &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; and, since no pointer is
assigned to then, they will leave no trace in the final
P-marker.
Another, and perhaps more economical, way to write
recognition rules corresponding to this transformation
involves conflating the additional phrase-structure rules
with the reverse of the transformational rule itself to
give rules of the fbllowing hind:

In fact, the elementary transformation for daughter
adjundtion that&apos;we are providing for here is more general
than that often allowed by transformational grammarians.
It is common tO require that if some element a is adjoined
as a daughter of another element b then b must have no
daughters before the transformation takes place.
Sister adjunctidh can be treated in an analogous
manner. Consider the following transformation:
X -A-B- Y
1 2 4 3 4
Adjoin 2 as right sister of 4.
The phrases existing before this transformation is carried
out, and which have &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; as a constituent, can be thought
of as being described by a set of rules as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.835114833333333">
44
9
a1 al
a2 9a2
an
an
</figure>
<figureCaption confidence="0.57421775">
Here the ai arc nonterminal symbols and the ai are strings,
possibly null. The grammar which doscribes the IIhrases
existing after the oncration of this transformation &apos;,lust
contain, in addition, the following rulen:
</figureCaption>
<equation confidence="0.5587635">
a1 B al A*
a2 B a2 A*
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97125875">
The reverse transformation itself can now be renresented
by a set of rules as follows:
3.1 ai.1 A*.2 = 2 9+ 1 +B
Notice that the strings referred to by the symbols &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; in both of the above transformations are unchanged
by the transformation and are therefore not mentioned at
all in the analysis rules. Experience shows that it is
in fact rarely necessary to write a separate rule for
each ai. In most cases, a transformation of this kind
45
could be handled in the program with a rule ot the following
form:.
13.1 ANY.1 A*.2 = 2 B+ 1 +8
This is one of a large number of cases in which it has
been found that the analysis rules can &apos;)e made more
permissive than the oriainal grammar suggests without,
introducing spurious structures and without seriously
increasing the amount of tine or snace used by the program.
While it is possible that transformational analysis
can be done in an interesting way with a program of this
sort, there seems to be little hope of finding an algorithm
for writing analysis rules corresponding to a given
transformational grammar. The following rule also involves
sister adjunction but noses much more serious problems
than the previous example:
X - A - Y - B - Z
1 2 3 4 5
Adjoin 2 as right sister of 4
The problem here is that a variable &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; intervenes between
&amp;quot;A&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;. On the face of it, the analysis rule
corresponding to this transformation would have to be
somewhat as follows:
*$Y1 B.2 *A.3 = 3 1 2
And in principal the program could carry out a rule of
this kind. However the first symbol on the left-hand
side of this rule will match any string whatsoever, so
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.595147">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.963205671428572">
thab, if the rule can be applied at all, it can be applied
in a prodigious number of ways. Rut, with real grammars,
it usually turns out that quite a lot can be said about
the part of the sentence covered by the variable &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; so
that analysis rules can be written which are safficiently
specific to be practicable.
Deletions are notoriously troublesome in Tammars
of any kind because they can so easily give rise to cycles
and undecidable problems. Transformational grammarians
require that lexical items should only be deleted from a
P7marker if there is some other copy of the same item
which remains. This condition insures what they call the
recoverability of the transformation. Powever, it is
very important to realize that recoverability, in this
sense, is a very weak condition. The rermirement is that,
knowing that an item has been deleted from a certain
position in the P-mar::er, it should be possible to tell
what that item was. But there is no requirement that a
P-marker should contain evidence that it as derived by
means of a deletion transformation or of the places in
it where deletions might have taken place.
Deletions are more easy to cope with in certain
gituations than others. Consider for example the following
transformation;
X -A-B-A- Y
1 2 3 4 5
Delete 4.
The recoverability requirement is satisfied because of
the identity of the second and fourth elements in the
structural index. The corresponding rule for the program
47
might be as follows:
23/22, A.1 .B.2 1 2 1
It is necessary to provide ordorino infornation with a
rule of this kind because it would otherwise be capable
of operating on its own output and cycling inOefinitely.
nut presumably this transZormation can be carried out any
number of timea&apos;and the are th:lrefore should be true of
the corresponding analysis rule. Once again, experience
shows that the grammarian almost invariably knows more
about the environment in which a deletion takes place
than is stated in the rule, and if this information is
used carefully, analysis rules can be written which do
not lead to cycles.
In principle the situation is oven worse in rules
of the following kind:
X -A-Y-A- Z
1 2 3 4 5
Delete 4
Here the third element is a variable which can cover any
number of nodes in the P malkeL. In analysis we are
therefore not only without information about how many
times the rule may have been applied but we know nothing
about where to insert new copies of the symbol &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, except
that they must be to the right of the existing copy.
The other commonly used elementary transformations
(substitutions and Chomsky-adjunction) do not present
special problems. The main outstanding difficulty comes
from the fact that transformational rules are ordered.
48
We have already said that the theory of transformational
grammar is in a state of continual change and this is
particularly true of the part that concerns the ordering
of rules. For this reason we have assumed that the rules
are simply ordered in the hope that other nossihilities
will not he notably more difficult to deal with. We shall
also make theassumntion that transformational rules are
all obligatory.
Consider npw the following grammar
Phrase structure
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8310705">
1. S A (D) B C
2. C D E
Transformations
1. A - B - X
</listItem>
<table confidence="0.7609266">
1 2 3
0 2+1 3
2.X -B -D-
1 2 3 4
1 3+2 0 4
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.927849090909091">
and suppose that the program is required to analyze the
string &amp;quot;A D B E&amp;quot;. Since, in generation, the list of
transformations is read from top to bottom it is reasonable
to suppose that in analysis it should be read from bottom
49
to top. We may take it that the analysis rule corresponding
to the second thnsformation is somewhat as follows:
D.1 B.2 = 2 1
-his, together with the two phrase-structure rules, is
sufficient to give a complete analysis of the string with
this underlying P-marher:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.998648" genericHeader="method">
4 A
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.934771333333333">
A B
But if this is an underlying P-narker, the second
transformational rule could not possibly be used to produce
a derived structure from it because the first
transformation, which according to our assumption is
obligatory, can be applied to it giving the following
result:
sc
B A
It is in fact not sufficient to scan the list of
transformations from bottom to top because this procedure
does not make allowance for the fact that the
transformations are obligatory. To regard transformations
as optional which were intended to be obligatory is in
general to associate spurious base structures to some
50
sentences. The solution for the present grammar is to
use the following set of analysis rules:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.410391666666667">
1/0, A D
2/1, 0.1 0.2 = 2 1
3/2, A A
</figure>
<equation confidence="0.731029666666667">
4/3, 0.1 1\.2 = 2 1
0.1 E.1 = C(1)
A.1 $0.1 0.1 C.1 = S(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987426727272727">
The first and third rules contain, in effect, the structural
indice8 from the second and first transformations
respectively. The first rule says that no string is
acceptable as a sentence which contains &amp;quot;0 D&amp;quot; as a suh-
string because to this it would have 1en mossihle to
apply transformation 2. The second rule reverses the
effect of transformation 2. The third rule eNzludes any
P-marker existing at this stage ,/ith a proper analysis
containing &amp;quot;A B&amp;quot; as a sub-string. This is the structural
index of transformation 1 which therefore should have
been applied to any P-marker containing it. The .7ourth
rule reverses the effect of transforration 1 and the
remaining rules are the dhrase-structure com2onent of the
grammar. Once again it turns out that what may ba.necessary
in theory is only rarely needed in 2ractice. Fxperience
with this program is, so far, very limitee but no cases
have so far been found in which incorrect analYses have
resulted from omitting rules such as those numbered one
and three above.
CONCLUSIONS
It requires skill to write rules for analyzing
natural sentences with the ?rogram described in this
