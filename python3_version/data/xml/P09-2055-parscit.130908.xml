Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9327094">
In this paper we introduce a bilingual diction-
ary generating tool that does not use any large
bilingual corpora. With this tool we implement
our novel pivot based bilingual dictionary
generation method that uses mainly the
WordNet of the pivot language to build a new
bilingual dictionary. We propose the usage of
WordNet for good accuracy, introducing also a
double directional selection method with local
thresholds to maximize recall.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999730571428571">
Bilingual dictionaries are an essential, perhaps even
indispensable tool not only as resources for ma-
chine translation, but also in every day activities or
language education. While such dictionaries are
available to and from numerous widely used lan-
guages, less represented language pairs have rarely
a reliable dictionary with good coverage. The need
for bilingual dictionaries for these less common
language pairs is increasing, but qualified human
resources are scarce. Considering that in these con-
ditions manual compilation is highly costly, alter-
native methods are imperative.
Pivot language based bilingual dictionary gen-
eration is one plausible such alternative (Tanaka
and Umemura, 1994; Sjöbergh, 2005; Shirai and
Yamamoto, 2001; Bond and Ogura, 2007). These
methods do not use large bilingual corpora, thus
being suitable for low-resourced languages.
Our paper presents iChi, the implementation
of our own method, an easy-to-use, customizable
tool that generates a bilingual dictionary.
The paper is structured as follows: first we
briefly describe the methodological background
of our tool, after which we describe its basic
functions, concluding with discussions. Thor-
ough description and evaluation, including com-
parative analysis, are available in Varga and Yo-
koyama (2009).

2.1 Pivot based dictionary generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974606060606">
Pivot language based bilingual dictionary gen-
eration methods rely on the idea that the lookup
of a word in an uncommon language through a
third, intermediated language can be automated.
Bilingual dictionaries to a third, intermediate
language are used to link the source and target
words. The pivot language translations of the
source and target head words are compared, the
suitability of the source-target word pair being
estimated based on the extent of the common
elements.
There are two known problems of conven-
tional pivot methods. First, a global threshold is
used to determine correct translation pairs. How-
ever, the scores highly depend on the entry itself
or the number of translations in the intermediate
language, therefore there is a variance in what
that score represents. Second, current methods
perform a strictly lexical overlap of the source-
intermediate and target-intermediate entries.
Even if the translations from the source and tar-
get languages are semantically transferred to the
intermediate language, lexically it is rarely the
case. However, due to the different word-usage
or paraphrases, even semantically identical or
very similar words can have different definitions
in different dictionaries. As a result, because of
the lexical characteristic of their overlap, current
methods cannot identify the differences between
totally different definitions resulted by unrelated
concepts, and differences in only nuances re-
sulted by lexicographers describing the same
concept, but with different words.

information extracted from WordNet (Miller et.
al., 1990). We use the following information:
sense description, synonymy, antonymy and se-
mantic categories, provided by the tree structure
of nouns and verbs.
To improve recall, we introduce bidirectional
selection. As we stated above, the global thresh-
old eliminates a large number of good translation
pairs, resulting in a low recall. As a solution, we
can group the translations that share the same
source or target entry, and set local thresholds
for each head word. For example, for a source
language head word entry_source there could be
multiple target language candidates: en-
try_target1, ... ,entry_targetn. If the top scoring
entry_targetk candidates are selected, we ensure
that at least one translation will be available for
entry_source, maintaining a high recall. Since we
can group the entries in the source language and
target language as well, we perform this selection
twice, once in each direction. Local thresholds
depend on the top scoring entry_target, being set
to maxscore•c. Constant c varies between 0 and 1,
allowing a small window for not maximum, but
high scoring candidates. It is language and selec-
tion method dependent (See 3.2 for details).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997819">
2.3 Brief method description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937941176471">
First, using the source-pivot and pivot-target dic-
tionaries, we connect the source (s) and target (t)
entries that share at least one common translation
in the intermediate (i) language. We consider
each such source-target pair a translation candi-
date. Next we eliminate erroneous candidates.
We examine the translation candidates one by
one, looking up the source-pivot and target-pivot
dictionaries, comparing pivot language transla-
tions. There are six types of translations that we
label A-F and explain below as follows.
First, we select translation candidates whose
translations into the intermediate language match
perfectly (type A translations).
For most words WordNet offers sense descrip-
tion in form of synonyms for most of its senses.
For a given translation candidate (s,t) we look up
the source-pivot and target-pivot translations
(s--+I={s--+iJ,...,s--+i„}, t�I={�����������}).
We select the elements that are common in the
two definitions (I’=(s,l)n(t--+l)) and we at-
tempt to identify their respective senses from
WordNet (sns(I)), comparing each synonym in
the WordNet’s synonym description with each
word from the pivot translations. As a result, we
arrive at a certain set of senses from the source-
pivot definitions (sns((s--+1)) and target-pivot
definitions (sns((t--+1)). We mark scoreB(s,t) the
Jaccard coefficient of these two sets. Scores that
pass a global threshold (0.1) are selected as
translation pairs. Since synonymy information is
available for nouns (N), verbs (V), adjectives (A)
and adverbs (R), four separate scores are calcu-
lated for each POS (type B).

<bodyText confidence="0.999972882352941">
We expand the source-to-pivot and target-to-
pivot definitions with information from WordNet
(synonymy, antonymy and semantic category).
The similarity of the two expanded pivot lan-
guage descriptions gives a better indication on
the suitability of the translation candidate. Since
the same word or concept’s translations into the
pivot language also share the same semantic
value, the extension with synonyms
(ext(l--+i)=(lei)∪syn(l--+i), where l={s,t}) the
extended translation should share more common
elements (type C).
In case of antonymy, we expand the initial
definitions with the antonyms of the antonyms
(ext(l--+i)=(lei)∪ant(ant(l--+i)), where l={s,t}).
This extension is different from the synonymy
extension, in most cases the resulting set of
words being considerably larger (type D).
Synonymy and antonymy information are
available for nouns, verbs, adjectives and ad-
verbs, thus four separate scores are calculated for
each POS.
Semantic categories are provided by the tree
structure (hypernymy/hyponymy) of nouns and
verbs of WordNet. We transpose each entry from
the pivot translations to its semantic category
(ext(l--+i)=(lei)∪semcat(l--+i), where l={s,t}).
We assume that the correct translation pairs
share a high percentage of semantic categories.
Local thresholds are set based on the best
scoring candidate for a given entry. The thresh-
olds were maxscore•0.9 for synonymy and an-
tonymy; and maxscore•0.8 for the semantic cate-
gories (see §3.2 for details).

For a given entry, the three separate candidate
lists of type C, D and E selection methods re-

translations were among the top scoring ones, but
not always scoring best. To correct this fault, a
combined selection method is performed com-
bining these lists. For every translation candidate

each entry from the frequency dictionary, verify-

dictionary. If it is recalled, we weight it with its
frequency from the frequency dictionary.
Our method maintains the recall value of the

with various threshold settings on the same (cor-

with Hungarian-Japanese we considered all
translation candidates whose Hungarian entry
starts with “zs” (IPA: ʒ). 133 head words total-
ling 515 translation candidates comprise this set,

termine which ones provide with the best F-
scores, e.g. retain most marked correct transla-

follows: for example using synonymy informa-
tion (type C) in case of threshold=0.85%, 343 of
the 515 translation pairs were above the thresh-
old. Among these, 221 were marked as correct,
thus the precision being 221/343.100=64.43 and
the recall being 221/273.100=80.95. F-score is
the harmonic mean of precision and recall (71.75
in this case).

If heavily unbalanced resources dictionaries are
used, due to the bidirectional selection method
many erroneous entries will be generated. If one
polysemous pivot entry has multiple translations
into the source, but only some of them are trans-
lated into the target languages, unique, but incor-
rect source-target pairs will be generated. For
example, with an English pivoted dictionary that
has multiple translation of ‘bank’ onto the source
(‘financial institution’, ‘river bank’), but only
one into the target language (‘river bank’), the
incorrect source(‘financial institution’)-
target(‘river bank’) pair will be generated, since
target(‘river bank’) has no other alternative.

problems concerning the methodology of iChi,

While such dictionaries are available to and from numerous widely used languages, less represented language pairs have rarely a reliable dictionary with good coverage. The need for bilingual dictionaries for these less common language pairs is increasing, but qualified human resources are scarce. Considering that in these conditions manual compilation is highly costly, alternative methods are imperative. Pivot language based bilingual dictionary generation is one plausible such alternative (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994; Sjöbergh, 2005; Shirai and Yamamoto, 2001; Bond and Ogura, 2007). These methods do not use large bilingual corpora, thus being suitable for low-resourced languages. Our paper presents iChi, the implementation of our own method, an easy-to-use, customizable tool that generates a bilingual dictionary. The paper is structured as follows: first we briefly describe the methodological background of our tool, after which we describe its basic functions, concluding with discussions.

Thorough description and evaluation, including comparative analysis, are available in Varga and Yokoyama (2009). 2 Methodological background 2.1 Pivot based dictionary generation Pivot language based bilingual dictionary generation methods rely on the idea that the lookup of a word in an uncommon language through a third, intermediated language can be automated. Bilingual dictionaries to a third, intermediate language are used to link the source and target words. The pivot language translations of the source and target head words are compared, the suitability of the source-target word pair being estimated based on the extent of the common elements. There are two known problems of conventional pivot met</context>
