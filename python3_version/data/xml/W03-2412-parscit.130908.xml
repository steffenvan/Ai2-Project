This paper presents a corpus-based SFL-
analysis of the English and German reg-
ister &amp;quot;travel guide&amp;quot;. It discusses the re-
search design necessary to identify
lexico-grammatical register features on
an empirical basis. By including transla-
tions in the corpus it becomes possible to
make statements not only on the charac-
teristic features but also on intuitive
translational realizations that diverge
from these features. Finally, perspectives
for computational applications of the pre-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934763157895">
Describing a register requires a representative
study which entails an empirical corpus-based
research design. The present corpus-study aims
at describing the register &amp;quot;travel guide&amp;quot; cross-
linguistically in English and German. As the de-
scription is intended to yield register information
for translators, translated travel guides are also
included in the corpus.
Over the last decade the specific properties of
translated texts have evolved as an important
issue in translation studies. A number of studies
dealt with the description of typical differences
between translations and original texts in the
same language. Baker (1993) hypothesized that
these systematic differences were universal.
Consequently they could be identified in the
translations without taking into account the
source language originals — under the precondi-
tion that the translations are taken from diverse
languages. Baker suggested using corpus lin-
guistic methodology to verify this hypothesis.
While earlier studies (e.g. Laviosa-
Braithwaite, 1996) focussed on analysing raw
corpora it has become more and more obvious
that more abstract linguistic information has to
be investigated in order to explain the specific
properties of translations. Particularly the work
of Teich (2001) and Hansen (2002) is seminal for
this kind of research. The use of corpus linguistic
methods is common to all of these studies for
investigating the properties of translations.
Steiner (2002) assumes three sources for these
properties: They could either be due to typologi-
cal constraints of the languages involved, or
brought about by the process of understanding
during the translation process or finally by dif-
fering register features. The present study con-
centrates on the latter source.

Making statements on the typical features of
travel guides in two languages as well as on di-
verging realizations in translations calls for a
rather complex corpus design. The design is fur-
ther complicated by the aim of giving an over-
view of the most important lexico-grammatical
features instead of picking out just one feature.
This aim restricts the choice of a computer tool
for linguistic interpretation of the corpus. In the
following, these characteristics of the study are
discussed in turn.

tions. At the same time these corpora should
permit distinguishing the specific register fea-
tures from language typological influences.
Identifying register features: In a first
step the monolingual identification of register
features has to be dealt with. It is deemed impos-
sible to determine features characteristic of a
given register by merely computing frequencies
in a register-controlled corpus. Unless it is con-
trasted to a basis of comparison, a seemingly
significant feature could be as frequent as or
even less frequent than in other registers, nor is it
sufficient to compare the register under investi-
gation to a neighboring register. Similarities
could be characteristic of just these two registers.
The specific properties of a given register only
become visible if compared to a mixture of other
registers serving as a tertium comparationis. The
English reference corpus (E Ref) was compiled
by taking texts from a sub-sample of the FLOB-
corpus, a broad-ranged corpus aiming at a &amp;quot;gen-
eral representation of text types&amp;quot; of British Eng-
lish (Johansson et al., 1978)% which was slightly
adapted by replacing some of the fiction registers
with the registers &amp;quot;cooking recipe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;call for ten-
der&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;prepared speech&amp;quot;.
The same applies to the German reference
corpus (G Ref) with the sub-sample taken from
the PAROLE-corpus, provided by the TELRI
Research Archive of Computational Tools and
Resources (TRACTOR),2 adapted to match the
modified FLOB-based English reference-corpus.
The register-controlled corpora (E Ori, G Ori)
were sampled from original travel guides se-
lected by the purposive sampling method. Items
were deliberately picked with a view to covering
a comprehensive variety of specimens of the reg-
ister &amp;quot;travel guide&amp;quot; from a range of publishing
companies, authors and travel destinations.3
Distinguishing language-typological in-
fluences: Apart from serving to identify mono-
lingual register features, the reference corpora in
both languages also have another function. They
help distinguish register-specific features from
language-typological influences in the cross-lin-
guistic comparison.

Neumann (2002)
Translations: Finally, in order to gain in-
sight into how the translators treat the register
features intuitively, a sub-corpus of translated
travel guides (G Trans) is taken into considera-
tion. Again, as for the sub-corpora of original
travel guides, the purposive sampling method
was used to put together the sub-corpus of trans-
lated travel guides. For reasons of feasibility only
one translation direction (English - German) is
included. Furthermore, the difficulty involved in
finding translations to match the random-
sampled originals lead to the decision not to use
parallel texts. Parallel texts, i.e. the matching
original texts, could help verify the interpretation
for findings in the translations. Under the con-
straints of the present study this is not possible.
Corpus size: The corpus size is designed to
meet Biber&apos;s (1990, 1993) recommendations.
According to his calculations ten 1,000-word
samples are sufficiently representative of the
lexico-grammatical features of a given corpus.
To be on the safe side — especially with respect
to the reference corpus representing a mixture of
registers —, 15 texts samples were included in
each sub-corpus. All in all, the set of five sub-
corpora as depicted in Figure 1 thus contains
approx. 75,000 words.

While it does not take into account the most deli-
cate specifications of every single feature, the
research is intended to cover a representative
range of lexico-grammatical features of the regis-
ter under investigation. As the functional ap-
proach of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)
is deemed particularly well-suited for cross-lin-

an analysis in accordance with Systemic Func-
tional Grammar.4
A brief sketch of SFL: SFL has its roots in
the anthropologist writings of Bronislaw Mali-
nowski and is oriented towards sociology. Its
main representative, M.A.K. Halliday, stipulates
that language cannot be investigated in an iso-
lated way but has to be seen in its situational and
cultural context. Language is thus described as a
social resource enabling speaker and addressee to
interact meaningfully.
Language is seen as a system of interlocking
options for realizing meaning. These options are
then related to each other by structures. SFL thus
emphasizes the paradigmatic relationships which
are represented in systemic networks (Figure 2
shows the transitivity part of the network used
for the present study). Halliday (1994:xiv) calls
this systemic aspect of SFL a &amp;quot;theory of meaning
as choice&amp;quot;.

The functional character of SFL manifests in
its concentration on language in use. Functional
also implies that the linguistic elements that real-
ize meaning are described with respect to their
function in the overall linguistic system. Finally
— and most centrally — according to Halliday
every language is organized around three highly
generalized functional perspectives on meaning
which are at work at the same time. The idea-
tional metafunction refers to the character of
meaning as organization of experience as well as
to the logical relationships realized by language.
Language&apos;s character of helping speakers and
addressees to interact is covered by the interper-
sonal metafunction. The textual metafunction
Another reason for choosing this grammar theory was that SFL&apos;s focus on
language in use as well as the interlocking abstract and more concrete levels
correspond to the empirical methodology of a corpus-based study (cf. Neu-
mann, 2002).
concerns the way meaning is organized to form a
text.
SFL describes language as a complex semiotic
system consisting of different increasingly con-
crete strata with lexico-grammar as the central
stratum. In this context, the three metafunctions
have different realizations on each stratum.
Features for the present study: The broad
coverage of lexico-grammatical features in com-
bination with the corpus design lead to a very
complex interpretation task and made it neces-
sary to limit the number of hypotheses to be in-
vestigated. Therefore more data that could for
instance be yielded from part-of-speech-tagging
was not included — although this should be seen
as future work to make the description more
comprehensive.
Prior to the analysis ten hypotheses about
characteristics of travel guides were deduced
from the register variables that refer to the situ-
ational context. These variables field, tenor and
mode realize in turn the ideational, interpersonal
and textual metafunction. They specify features
from the grammatical systems transitivity, cir-
cumstantiation, mood, modality, voice and
theme. The annotation scheme for English draws
on Halliday (1994) and Matthiessen (1995). Its
German counterpart is based on the description
of Teich (2001) and Steiner and Teich (in print).
This design allowed the correlation of lexico-
grammatical features with more abstract state-
ments on characteristics of the register under in-
vestigation like orientation towards content
versus addressee etc. In the transitivity system
the frequency of the different process types - dif-
ferent types of goings-on that manifest by means
of language — was counted. As to circumstantia-
tion, the occurrence of circumstances that extent
the core combination of process and participants
in a clause was computed. Particularly the loca-
tive sub-type was of interest in this context.
While these two systems realize the ideational
metafunction, the systems mood and modality
can be related to the interpersonal metafunction.
The mood options declarative, interrogative and
imperative were analyzed as well as more deli-
cate options regarding the verbalization of the
interactants, i.e. either speaker or addressee. For
modality, especially the frequency of modula-
tion, i.e. the degree of obligation or inclination, is
under investigation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999871777777778">
Passive is interpreted as a realization of the in-
terpersonal as well as of the textual metafunc-
tion. Finally under the textual metafunction, the
frequency of the different elements realized in
thematic position is counted with a focus on spa-
tial circumstances.

ings that were gained on the basis of this annota-
tion scheme.

2.3 The Computer tool
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999434">
The complex research design in combination
with a set of features that proved to be rather ab-
stract restricted the selection of a computer tool
considerably. The choice fell on O&apos;Dormell&apos;s
(1995) Systemic Coder. This tool facilitates the
manual linguistic analysis of a corpus. It allows
the definition of a feature hierarchy supports the
marking of segments and prompts the relevant
categories. Coder organizes the features in a sys-
temic network, hence in form of an inheritance
hierarchy. This reduces the annotation effort no-
ticeably: Only the features relevant to the respec-
tive stage of annotation are presented. Coder then
statistically records the features selected by the
annotator. The corpus, enriched with linguistic
information, is saved in XML-format and is at
disposal for processing in other applications.
Coder&apos;s review function supports querying for
single features or feature combinations.
Although compared to an analysis which is not
computer-aided the Systemic Coder speeds up
the analysis, the annotation effort is still enor-
mous. Therefore the corpus size chosen for the
present study is the maximum that can be han-
dled by one annotator.

The research design made it possible to identify a

of the study the lexico-grammatical features un-

indicators of the hypotheses that were related to
the register variables. The results&apos; gained from
the analysis of these lexico-grammatical features

lying register variables. This resulted in register

profiles of English and German travel guides as
well as a cross-linguistic comparison of these
profiles. The consideration of translations pro-
duced a generalization that was, again, put in
relation to the monolingual profiles.
To identify register features the value for each
feature in the register-controlled corpus is com-
pared to the respective value in the reference
corpus. After applying the chi-square-test to
check significance of the results the value can be
described as either a positive or a negative fea-
ture depending on whether it is significantly
higher or lower than the reference value.

3.1 Monolingual characteristics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999166692307692">
English travel guides: English travel guides
can be characterized as being rather fact-ori-
ented. These ideational features outweigh inter-
personal characteristics which lose importance
when compared to the reference corpus.
This becomes apparent in the significantly
more frequent use of relational processes in
travel guides compared to the other registers in-
cluded in the study. Material processes occur as
often as in the other registers and are thus neutral
to the register &amp;quot;travel guide&amp;quot;. Mental and verbal
process types are underrepresented in travel
guides. Figure 2 illustrates these findings.

The extensive use of circumstances appears to
be typical of this register, giving travel guides a
more nominal character in comparison to the ref-
erence corpus. This underpins findings by Nils-
son (2001) who concludes a descriptive character
of travel guides from the frequent occurrence of
complex NPs in combination with rather simple
sentence structures. With respect to the sub-types
of circumstantiation, location is the only positive
feature in travel guides. The other sub-types are

either insignificant or constitute a negative fea-
ture. The frequency of relational processes might
be correlated with locative circumstances thus
relating inanimate things like buildings or places
of interest to their spatial situation. In his study
of transitivity in topographic procedures Matthi-
essen (1998) calls this &amp;quot;rest in space&amp;quot;.
While interrogatives do not occur, imperatives
are significantly less frequent than in the refer-
ence corpus and thus represent a negative regis-
ter feature. This lack of instructions and
recommendations in combination with the con-
centration on expository description by means of
relational processes points to a fairly neutral
agentive role of the author. He or she takes on
the role of giving information rather than that of
giving advice.
The verbalization of the interactants was ana-
lyzed to make statements on whether travel
guides are rather more oriented towards the ad-
dressee or towards the content. This feature can
be characterized as register neutral. It occurs in
travel guides as often as in the other registers.
Nevertheless there is a significant shift among
the more delicate variants of interactants: The
speaker is verbalized less frequently, which
makes the direct address of the reader the pre-
ferred option. This feature points in the direction
of a consultative style, but the significantly fre-
quent use of passive constructions again shifts
the balance towards an impersonal mode of ex-
pression.
With respect to thematic element, the charac-
ter of English as a fixed word order language
restricts register-specific variation to a certain
degree. Still, a significant positive deviation to
the register corpus can be observed with respect
to spatial circumstances in thematic position. By
realizing a spatial circumstance as thematic ele-
ment before giving the reader some expository
information the author follows the chronological
order in which the reader moves.
German travel guides: The overall char-
acteristics stated earlier for English travel guides
also apply to their German counterparts, albeit to
a higher degree. German travel guides strongly
rely on experiential characteristics. Interpersonal
features recede in favor of ideational characteris-
tics.
These characteristics manifest in a signifi-
cantly higher value for material processes, while
mental and verbal are significantly less frequent
than in other registers. That means in travel
guides what is felt or spoken is neglectable com-
pared to what is actively done, a fact that is little
surprising. Circumstances play an even more
important role in German than in English travel
guides. This high frequency is one symptom of a
nominal style. Particularly the locative type of
circumstances is clearly characteristic of travel
guides, as the author aims to provide an orienta-
tion in space for the reader.
With respect to mood options, imperatives are
significantly less frequent in travel guides than in
other registers, even more so than in English
travel guides. Interrogatives are altogether miss-
ing. Thus declaratives are overwhelmingly fre-
quent. As imperative meaning is neither con-
veyed indirectly in the form of modality it can be
said German travel guides do not show a con-
sultative style. Judging from the overall results
for mood, the relationship between author and
reader can be characterized as one of exchanging
information in a neutral way. The author does
not give advice from a higher position which
would manifest for example in a frequent use of
imperatives.
The results regarding verbalization of interac-
tants show a significantly negative value pointing
to a concentration on factual information rather
than building up a relationship between author
and reader. When taking into account the more
delicate variants that discriminate between
speaker and addressee, a redistribution of the
reference values becomes visible. While in the
reference corpus mostly the speaker is verba-
lized, there is a shift towards addressing the
reader in travel guides. The value for passive
rises significantly in comparison to the registers
sampled in the reference corpus. While this fea-
ture points to the fact-orientedness of travel
guides it may at least partly also be attributed to
the function of a varied mode of expression.
These last two features — when supposing the
function of varied style for passive — can be in-
terpreted as at least a slight turning towards ad-
dressee orientation.
The analysis of the thematic element further
substantiates statements made earlier in connec-
tion with circumstantiation. Parallel to the

<bodyText confidence="0.999838555555556">
reader&apos;s orientation in space, the authors of Ger-
man travel guides very often put a spatial cir-
cumstance in thematic position, thus helping the
reader to find his/her position first before s/he
goes on to tell him/her what s/he can do or see at
the place described. This supports Enkvist&apos;s
(1991) thesis of a &amp;quot;stop-look-see strategy&amp;quot;,
which he claims is used universally in travel
guides.

3.2 Cross-linguistic comparison
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998809375">
The registers in both languages prove to be rather
similar. Although for six out of ten hypotheses
the cross-linguistic differences are significant,
the compared results point in the same direction.
The differences show in the degree to which a
given feature is distinct in the respective lan-
guage.
The feature circumstantiation, for instance,
was found to be characteristic of travel guides in
both languages, featuring a nominal style in this
register both in English and in German. In cross-
linguistic comparison the difference between
both values is still significant. Figure 3 gives an
overview of the frequency of circumstances
found in the register-controlled and reference
corpora.

Here a language-typological explanation
comes into play. German can be characterized as
a language which strongly relies on ideational
meaning, while English seems to be more ori-
ented towards the addressee (cf. House, 1997).
Considering the given typological constraints the
frequent use of circumstantiation still constitutes
a positive feature of both English and German
travel guides.

3.3 Diverging realizations in transla-
tions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996325">
How did translators intuitively deal with the
cross-linguistic differences and similarities of the
register under investigation? Did they adhere to
the target language register characteristics? The
results of the study show that the values for
translated travel guides mostly lie between the
values pertaining to originals in both languages.
There are some interesting divergences. These
refer to features that are realized in a way which
is contrary to both the source and the target lan-
guage register characteristic.
First, the feature &amp;quot;spatial circumstance&amp;quot; shows
no significant difference in cross-linguistic com-
parison and thus should not pose a problem for
translators. Still, the value for this feature in
translated travel guides deviates significantly
from the source language value.
Secondly, translators verbalize interactants
significantly more often than authors of originals
in both languages.
Finally, passive constructions occur signifi-
cantly less frequently in translations than in
originals in both languages.
The first of these three features may be an in-
dication of the translator&apos;s intention to make the
text more explicit. He/she might want to make
sure that the reader finds his/her way in space.
The other two features show that translators in-
tuitively make their texts more reader-friendly by
increasing the direct address of either speaker or
reader as well as by using less impersonal pas-
sive constructions.
Generally speaking, it can be said that the
translated travel guides are more addressee-ori-
ented than originals in both languages and there-
fore contain more interpersonal traits than the
originals in both languages.
This takes us to a possible application of the
present study for translation purposes. Transla-
tors could use the linguistic information com-
piled in the present study when deciding how to
translate a certain feature — mainly of course if
they whish to make their translations more in line
with the target language register characteristics.
A translator could thus apply the analysis de-
scribed here to the travel guide s/he is transla-
ting. But as this procedure is excessively time-
consuming, a computational solution would have

<bodyText confidence="0.999979888888889">
A possible solution could involve integrating
register-specific linguistic information in a trans-
lation memory. This could be achieved by feed-
ing a register description like the description of
travel guides introduced here to a translation
memory. The translation process could then be
combined with linguistic annotation of the text
according to the register features.
This annotation could then be compared with
the register description. For the integration of
register-specific information in a translation
memory the combination of linguistic annotation
with the functionalities of a translation memory
has to be worked out.
This integration in a translation memory
would make sense in the context of a multilin-
gual register lexicon: This lexicon should not be
restricted to terminology but should also include
grammatical data as well as more abstract infor-
mation about typical correlations of certain fea-
tures. The multilingual register lexicon raises
questions regarding multi-layer annotation and
representation of complex linguistic information
for querying.
Finally, the register-specific training of a
parser would represent a spin-off of this kind of
research.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9916276875">
Not only does the register study presented here
give an overview of the main lexico-grammatical
features of travel guides and their more abstract
function. It also proves that intuitive register
knowledge is not sufficient for translating in line
with the register characteristics of the source or
the target language.
The research design of the present study has
the following characteristics:
• The corpus size allows general state-
ments on the register under investi-
gation.
• The corpus design with the opposi-
tion of a register-controlled corpus to
a reference corpus permits the identi-
fication of register-specific features
against the background of a basis of
comparison.
• The study is based on Systemic Func-
tional Linguistics, a linguistic theory
that is suitable for cross-linguistic
comparison.
This results in a register profile of travel
guides in both languages as well as in specific
statements on how translators realized texts be-
longing to this register.
Extensive information about characteristic fea-
tures of travel guides is of use not only for trans-
lators but also for authors of original travel
guides.
The present study can also serve as a template
for further register studies. This would however
require an extension of the size and composition
of the two reference corpora: It is questionable to
what degree a corpus consisting of 15 registers
corresponds to a representative overview of the
registers in the given languages. The reference
corpus might serve as a monitor corpus that can
be extended by each register analyzed in the way
described here. As to their quantitative repre-
sentation, the quantity of the register samples is
capable of improvement. For further use of the
present research design an extension of the refe-
rence corpora is therefore a precondition.
Another perspective for future work is the ex-
tension of the analysis to different levels. This
could for instance include part-of-speech tag-
ging.

The present corpus-study aims at describing the register &amp;quot;travel guide&amp;quot; crosslinguistically in English and German. As the description is intended to yield register information for translators, translated travel guides are also included in the corpus. Over the last decade the specific properties of translated texts have evolved as an important issue in translation studies. A number of studies dealt with the description of typical differences between translations and original texts in the same language. Baker (1993) hypothesized that these systematic differences were universal. Consequently they could be identified in the translations without taking into account the source language originals — under the precondition that the translations are taken from diverse languages. Baker suggested using corpus linguistic methodology to verify this hypothesis. While earlier studies (e.g. LaviosaBraithwaite, 1996) focussed on analysing raw corpora it has become more and more obvious that more abstract linguistic information has to be investigated in order to explain the specific properties of translations.

Halliday, stipulates that language cannot be investigated in an isolated way but has to be seen in its situational and cultural context. Language is thus described as a social resource enabling speaker and addressee to interact meaningfully. Language is seen as a system of interlocking options for realizing meaning. These options are then related to each other by structures. SFL thus emphasizes the paradigmatic relationships which are represented in systemic networks (Figure 2 shows the transitivity part of the network used for the present study). Halliday (1994:xiv) calls this systemic aspect of SFL a &amp;quot;theory of meaning as choice&amp;quot;. material relational mental verbal existential behavioral . PROCESStransitivity TYPE Figure 2. Systemic network for transitivity The functional character of SFL manifests in its concentration on language in use.

The use of corpus linguistic methods is common to all of these studies for investigating the properties of translations. Steiner (2002) assumes three sources for these properties: They could either be due to typological constraints of the languages involved, or brought about by the process of understanding during the translation process or finally by differing register features. The present study concentrates on the latter source. 2 Research design Making statements on the typical features of travel guides in two languages as well as on diverging realizat</context>

German can be characterized as a language which strongly relies on ideational meaning, while English seems to be more oriented towards the addressee (cf. House, 1997). Considering the given typological constraints the frequent use of circumstantiation still constitutes a positive feature of both English and German travel guides. 3.3 Diverging realizations in translations How did translators intuitively deal with the cross-linguistic differences and similarities of the register under investigation? Did they adhere to the target language register characteristics? The results of the study show that the values for translated travel guides mostly lie between the values pertaining to originals in both languages. There are some interesting divergences.

Again, as for the sub-corpora of original travel guides, the purposive sampling method was used to put together the sub-corpus of translated travel guides.

Prior to the analysis ten hypotheses about characteristics of travel guides were deduced from the register variables that refer to the situational context. These variables field, tenor and mode realize in turn the ideational, interpersonal and textual metafunction. They specify features from the grammatical systems transitivity, circumstantiation, mood, modality, voice and theme. The annotation scheme for English draws on Halliday (1994) and Matthiessen (1995). Its German counterpart is based on the description of Teich (2001) and Steiner and Teich (in print). This design allowed the correlation of lexicogrammatical features with more abstract statements on characteristics of the register under investigation like orientation towards content versus addressee etc. In the transitivity system the frequency of the different process types - different types of goings-on that manifest by means of language — was counted. As to circumstantiation, the occurrence of circumstances that extent the core combination of process and participants in a clause was computed. Particularly the locative sub-type was of interest in this con</context>
