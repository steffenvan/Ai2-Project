This paper describes a Web-based Eng-
lish-Chinese concordance system, Total-
Recall, developed to promote translation
reuse and encourage authentic and idio-
matic use in second language writing. We
exploited and structured existing high-
quality translations from the bilingual Si-
norama Magazine to build the concor-
dance of authentic text and translation.
Novel approaches were taken to provide
high-precision bilingual alignment on the
sentence, phrase and word levels. A
browser-based user interface (UI) is also
developed for ease of access over the
Internet. Users can search for word,
phrase or expression in English or Chi-
nese. The Web-based user interface facili-
tates the recording of the user actions to
provide data for further research.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980636363636">
A concordance tool is particularly useful for study-
ing a piece of literature when thinking in terms of a
particular word, phrase or theme. It will show ex-
actly how often and where a word occurs, so can
be helpful in building up some idea of how differ-
ent themes recur within an article or a collection of
articles. Concordances have been indispensable for
lexicographers and increasingly considered useful
for language instructor and learners. A bilingual
concordance tool is like a monolingual concor-
dance, except that each sentence is followed by its
translation counterpart in a second language. It
could be extremely useful for bilingual lexicogra-
phers, human translators and second language
learners. Pierre Isabelle, in 1993, pointed out: “ex-
isting translations contain more solutions to more
translation problems than any other existing re-
source.” It is particularly useful and convenient
when the resource of existing translations is made
available on the Internet. A web based bilingual
system has proved to be very useful and popular.
For example, the English-French concordance sys-
tem, TransSearch (Macklovitch et al. 2000). Pro-
vides a familiar interface for the users who only
need to type in the expression in question, a list of
citations will come up and it is easy to scroll down
until one finds one that is useful. TotalRecall
comes with an additional feature making the solu-
tion more easily recognized. The user not only get
all the citations related to the expression in ques-
tion, but also gets to see the translation counterpart
highlighted.
TotalRecall extends the translation memory
technology and provide an interactive tool intended
for translators and non-native speakers trying to
find ideas to properly express themselves. Total-
Recall empower the user by allow her to take the
initiative in submitting queries for searching au-
thentic, contemporary use of English. These que-
ries may be single words, phrases, expressions or
even full sentence, the system will search a sub-
stantial and relevant corpus and return bilingual
citations that are helpful to human translators and
second language learners.

2 Aligning the corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890918918919">
Central to TotalRecall is a bilingual corpus and a
set of programs that provide the bilingual analyses
to yield a translation memory database out of the
bilingual corpus. Currently, we are working with a
collection of Chinese-English articles from the Si-
norama magazine. A large bilingual collection of
Studio Classroom English lessons will be provided
in the near future. That would allow us to offer
bilingual texts in both translation directions and
with different levels of difficulty. Currently, the
articles from Sinaroma seems to be quite usefully
by its own, covering a wide range of topics, re-
flecting the personalities, places, and events in
Taiwan for the past three decade.
The concordance database is composed of bi-
lingual sentence pairs, which are mutual transla-
tion. In addition, there are also tables to record
additional information, including the source of
each sentence pairs, metadata, and the information
on phrase and word level alignment. With that ad-
ditional information, TotalRecall provides various
functions, including 1. viewing of the full text of
the source with a simple click. 2. highlighted
translation counterpart of the query word or phrase.
3. ranking that is pedagogically useful for transla-
tion and language learning.
We are currently running an experimental pro-
totype with Sinorama articles, dated mainly from
1995 to 2002. There are approximately 50,000 bi-
lingual sentences and over 2 million words in total.
We also plan to continuously updating the database
with newer information from Sinorama magazine
so that the concordance is kept current and relevant
to the . To make these up to date and relevant.
The bilingual texts that go into TotalRecall
must be rearranged and structured. We describe the
main steps below:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985857">
2.1 Sentence Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956577777778">
After parsing each article from files and put them
into the database, we need to segment articles into
sentences and align them into pairs of mutual
translation. While the length-based approach
(Church and Gale 1991) to sentence alignment
produces surprisingly good results for the close
language pair of French and English at success
rates well over 96%, it does not fair as well for
distant language pairs such as English and Chinese.
Work on sentence alignment of English and Chi-
nese texts (Wu 1994), indicates that the lengths of
English and Chinese texts are not as highly corre-
lated as in French-English task, leading to lower
success rate (85-94%) for length-based aligners.
Table 1 The result of Chinese collocation candi-
dates extracted. The shaded collocation pairs are
selected based on competition of whole phrase log
likelihood ratio and word-based translation prob-
ability. Un-shaded items 7 and 8 are not selected
because of conflict with previously chosen bilin-
gual collocations, items 2 and 3.
Simard, Foster, and Isabelle (1992) pointed out
cognates in two close languages such as English
and French can be used to measure the likelihood
of mutual translation. However, for the English-
Chinese pair, there are no orthographic, phonetic
or semantic cognates readily recognizable by the
computer. Therefore, the cognate-based approach
is not applicable to the Chinese-English tasks.
At first, we used the length-based method for
sentence alignment. The average precision of
aligned sentence pairs is about 95%. We are now
switching to a new alignment method based on
punctuation statistics. Although the average ratio
of the punctuation counts in a text is low (less than
15%), punctuations provide valid additional evi-
dence, helping to achieve high degree of alignment
precision. It turns out that punctuations are telling
evidences for sentence alignment, if we do more
than hard matching of punctuations and take into
consideration of intrinsic sequencing of punctua-
tion in ordered comparison. Experiment results
show that the punctuation-based approach outper-
forms the length-based approach with precision
rates approaching 98%.

2.2 Phrase and Word Alignment

<bodyText confidence="0.99982875">
After sentences and their translation counterparts
are identified, we proceeded to carry out finer-
grained alignment on the phrase and word levels.
We employ part of speech patterns and statistical

analyses to extract bilingual phrases/collocations
from a parallel corpus. The preferred syntactic pat-
terns are obtained from idioms and collocations in
the machine readable English-Chinese version of
Longman Dictionary of Contemporary of English.
Phrases matching the patterns are extract from
aligned sentences in a parallel corpus. Those
phrases are subsequently matched up via cross lin-
guistic statistical association. Statistical association
between the whole phrase as well as words in
phrases are used jointly to link a collocation and its
counterpart collocation in the other language. See
Table 1 for an example of extracting bilingual col-
locations. The word and phrase level information is
kept in relational database for use in processing
queries, hightlighting translation counterparts, and
ranking citations. Sections 3 and 4 will give more
details about that.

3 The Queries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999641857142857">
The goal of the TotalRecall System is to allow a
user to look for instances of specific words or ex-
pressions. For this purpose, the system opens up
two text boxes for the user to enter queries in any
one of the languages involved or both. We offer
some special expressions for users to specify the
following queries:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.941231375">
• Exact single word query - W. For instance,
enter “work” to find citations that contain
“work,” but not “worked”, “working”,
“works.”
• Exact single lemma query – W+. For in-
stance, enter “work+” to find citations that
contain “work”, “worked”, “working”,
“works.”
• Exact string query. For instance, enter “in
the work” to find citations that contain the
three words, “in,” “the,” “work” in a row,
but not citations that contain the three words
in any other way.
• Conjunctive and disjunctive query. For in-
stance, enter “give+ advice+” to find cita-
tions that contain “give” and “advice.” It is
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998495">
also possible to specify the distance between
“give” and “advice,” so they are from a VO
construction. Similarly, enter “hard  |diffi-
cult  |tough” to find citations that involve
difficulty to do, understand or bear some-
thing, using any of the three words.
Once a query is submitted, TotalRecall dis-
plays the results on Web pages. Each result ap-
pears as a pair of segments, usually one sentence
each in English and Chinese, in side-by-side for-
mat. The words matching the query are high-
lighted, and a “context” hypertext link is included
in each row. If this link is selected, a new page ap-
pears displaying the original document of the pair.
If the user so wishes, she can scroll through the
following or preceding pages of context in the
original document.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.999254" genericHeader="method">
4 Ranking
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926">
It is well known that the typical user usual has no
patient to go beyond the first or second pages re-
turned by a search engine. Therefore, ranking and
putting the most useful information in the first one
or two is of paramount importance for search en-
gines. This is also true for a concordance.
Experiments with a focus group indicate that
the following ranking strategies are important:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.771187454545455">
• Citations with a translation counterpart
should be ranked first.
• Citations with a frequent translation coun-
terpart appear before ones with less frequent
translation
• Citations with same translation counterpart
should be shown in clusters by default. The
cluster can be called out entirely on demand.
• Ranking by nonlinguistic features should
also be provided, including date, sentence
length, query position in citations, etc.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919666666667">
With various ranking options available, the users
can choose one that is most convenient and
productive for the work at hand.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963578947368">
In this paper, we describe a bilingual concordance
designed as a computer assisted translation and
language learning tool. Currently, TotalRecall
uses Sinorama Magazine corpus as the translation
memory and will be continuously updated as new
issues of the magazine becomes available. We
have already put a beta version on line and ex-
perimented with a focus group of second language
learners. Novel features of TotalRecall include
highlighting of query and corresponding transla-
tions, clustering and ranking of search results ac-
cording translation and frequency.
TotalRecall enable the non-native speaker who
is looking for a way to express an idea in English
or Chinese. We are also adding on the basic func-
tions to include a log of user activities, which will
record the users’ query behavior and their back-
ground. We could then analyze the data and find
useful information for future research.
