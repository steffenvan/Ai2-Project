Paratactic syntactic structures are noto-
riously difficult to represent in depen-
dency formalisms. This has painful con-
sequences such as high frequency of pars-
ing errors related to coordination. In other
words, coordination is a pending prob-
lem in dependency analysis of natural lan-
guages. This paper tries to shed some
light on this area by bringing a system-
atizing view of various formal means de-
veloped for encoding coordination struc-
tures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of
such approaches and apply it to treebanks
across a typologically diverse range of 26
languages. In addition, empirical obser-
vations on convertibility between selected
styles of representations are shown too.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999925333333333">
In the last decade, dependency parsing has grad-
ually been receiving visible attention. One of
the reasons is the increased availability of depen-
dency treebanks, be they results of genuine depen-
dency annotation projects or converted automat-
ically from previously existing phrase-structure
treebanks.
In both cases, a number of decisions have to be
made during the construction or conversion of a
dependency treebank. The traditional notion of
dependency does not always provide unambiguous
solutions, e.g. when it comes to attaching func-
tional words. Worse, dependency representation is
at a loss when it comes to representing paratactic
linguistic phenomena such as coordination, whose
nature is symmetric (two or more conjuncts play
the same role), as opposed to the head-modifier
asymmetry of dependencies.1

<footnote confidence="0.555738">
1We use the term modifier (or child) for all types of de-
pendent nodes including arguments.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995484375">
The dominating solution in treebank design is to
introduce artificial rules for the encoding of coor-
dination structures within dependency trees using
the same means that express dependencies, i.e., by
using edges and by labeling of nodes or edges. Ob-
viously, any tree-shaped representation of a coor-
dination structure (CS) must be perceived only as
a “shortcut” since relations present in coordination
structures form an undirected cycle, as illustrated
already by Tesni`ere (1959). For example, if a noun
is modified by two coordinated adjectives, there
is a (symmetric) coordination relation between the
two conjuncts and two (asymmetric) dependency
relations between the conjuncts and the noun.
However, as there is no obvious linguistic in-
tuition telling us which tree-shaped CS encoding
is better and since the degree of freedom has sev-
eral dimensions, one can find a number of distinct
conventions introduced in particular dependency
treebanks. Variations exist both in topology (tree
shape) and labeling. The main goal of this pa-
per is to give a systematic survey of the solutions
adopted in these treebanks.
Naturally, the interplay of dependency and co-
ordination links in a single tree leads to serious
parsing issues.2 The present study does not try to
decide which coordination style is the best from
the parsing point of view.3 However, we believe
that our survey will substantially facilitate experi-
ments in this direction in the future, at least by ex-
ploring and describing the space of possible can-
didates.

2CSs have been reported to be one of the most frequent
sources of parsing errors (Green and ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2012; Mc-
Donald and Nivre, 2007; K¨ubler et al., 2009; Collins, 2003).
Their impact on quality of dependency-based machine trans-
lation can also be substantial; as documented on an English-
to-Czech dependency-based translation system (Popel and
ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2009), 39% of serious translation errors which
are caused by wrong parsing have to do with coordination.
3There might be no such answer, as different CS conven-
tions might serve best for different applications or for differ-
ent parser architectures.

Let us first recall the basic well-known character-
istics of CSs.
In the simplest case of a CS, a coordinating
conjunction joins two (usually syntactically and
semantically compatible) words or phrases called
conjuncts. Even this simplest case is difficult to
represent within a dependency tree because, in the
words of Lombardo and Lesmo (1998): Depen-
dency paradigms exhibit obvious difficulties with
coordination because, differently from most lin-
guistic structures, it is not possible to characterize
the coordination construct with a general schema
involving a head and some modifiers of it.
Proper formal representation of CSs is further
complicated by the following facts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9963012">
• CSs with more than two conjuncts (multi-
conjunct CSs) exist and are frequent.
• Besides “private” modifiers of individual
conjuncts, there are modifiers shared by
all conjuncts, such as in “Mary came and
cried”. Shared modifiers may appear along-
side with private modifiers of particular con-
juncts.
• Shared modifiers can be coordinated, too:
“big and cheap apples and oranges”.
• Nested (embedded) coordinations are possi-
ble: “John and Mary or Sam and Lisa”.
• Punctuation (commas, semicolons, three
dots) is frequently used in CSs, mostly with
multi-conjunct coordinations or juxtaposi-
tions which can be interpreted as CSs with-
out conjunctions (e.g. “Don’t worry, be
happy!”).
• In many languages, comma or other punctu-
ation mark may play the role of the main co-
ordinating conjunction.
• The coordinating conjunction may be a mul-
tiword expression (“as well as”).
• Deficient CSs with a single conjunct exist.
• Abbreviations like “etc.” comprise both the
conjunction and the last conjunct.
• Coordination may form very intricate struc-
tures when combined with ellipsis. For ex-
ample, a conjunct can be elided while its ar-
guments remain in the sentence, such as in
the following traditional example: “I gave
the books to Mary and the records to Sue.”
• The border between paratactic and hypotactic
surface means of expressing coordination re-
lations is fuzzy. Some languages can use en-
clitics instead of conjunctions/prepositions,
e.g. Latin “Senatus Populusque Romanus”.
Purely hypotactic surface means such as the
preposition in “John with Mary” occur too.4
• Careful semantic analysis of CSs discloses
additional complications: if a node is mod-
ified by a CS, it might happen that it is
the node itself (and not its modifiers) what
should be semantically considered as a con-
junct. Note the difference between “red and
white wine” (which is synonymous to “red
wine and white wine”) and “red and white
flag of Poland”. Similarly, “five dogs and
cats” has a different meaning than “five dogs
and five cats”.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979036">
Some of these issues were recognized already
by Tesni`ere (1959). In his solution, conjuncts are
connected by vertical edges directly to the head
and by horizontal edges to the conjunction (which
constitutes a cycle in every CS). Many different
models have been proposed since, out of which the
following are the most frequently used ones:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994216857142857">
• MS = Mel’ˇcuk style used in the Meaning-
Text Theory (MTT): the first conjunct is the
head of the CS, with the second conjunct at-
tached as a dependent of the first one, third
conjunct under the second one, etc. Coor-
dinating conjunction is attached under the
penultimate conjunct, and the last conjunct
is attached under the conjunction (Mel’ˇcuk,
1988),
• PS = Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT)
style: all conjuncts are attached under the
coordinating conjunction (along with shared
modifiers, which are distinguished by a spe-
cial attribute) (Hajiˇc et al., 2006),
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.9985922">
4As discussed by Stassen (2000), all languages seem to
have some strategy for expressing coordination. Some of
them lack the paratactic surface means (the so called WITH-
languages), but the hypotactic surface means are present al-
most always.
</footnote>

• SS = Stanford parser style:5 the first conjunct
is the head and the remaining conjuncts (as
well as conjunctions) are attached under it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998970787878788">
One can find various arguments supporting the
particular choices. MTT possesses a complex
set of linguistic criteria for identifying the gov-
ernor of a relation (see Mazziotta (2011) for an
overview), which lead to MS. MS is preferred in
a rule-based dependency parsing system of Lom-
bardo and Lesmo (1998). PS is advocated by
ˇStˇep´anek (2006) who claims that it can represent
shared modifiers using a single additional binary
attribute, while MS would require a more complex
co-indexing attribute. An argumentation of Tratz
and Hovy (2011) follows a similar direction: We
would like to change our [MS] handling of coordi-
nating conjunctions to treat the coordinating con-
junction as the head [PS] because this has fewer
ambiguities than [MS]...
We conclude that the influence of the choice of
coordination style is a well-known problem in de-
pendency syntax. Nevertheless, published works
usually focus only on a narrow ad-hoc selection of
few coordination styles, without giving any sys-
tematic perspective.
Choosing a file format presents a different prob-
lem. Despite various efforts to standardize lin-
guistic annotation,6 no commonly accepted stan-
dard exists. The primitive format used for CoNLL
shared tasks is widely used in dependency parsing,
but its weaknesses have already been pointed out
(cf. Straˇn´ak and ˇStˇep´anek (2010)). Moreover, par-
ticular treebanks vary in their contents even more
than in their format, i.e. each treebank has its own
way of representing prepositions or different gran-
ularity of syntactic labels.

In accordance with the usual conventions, we as-
sume that each sentence is represented by one de-
pendency tree, in which each node corresponds
to one token (word or punctuation mark). Apart
from that, we deliberately limit ourselves to CS
representations that have shapes of connected sub-
graphs of dependency trees.
We limit our inventory of means of expressing
CSs within dependency trees to (i) tree topology
(presence or absence of a directed edge between
two nodes, Section 3.1), and (ii) node labeling
(additional attributes stored insided nodes, Sec-
tion 3.2).8 Further, we expect that the set of pos-
sible variations can be structured along several di-
mensions, each of which corresponds to a certain
simple characteristic (such as choosing the left-
most conjunct as the CS head, or attaching shared
modifiers below the nearest conjunct). Even if it
does not make sense to create the full Cartesian
product of all dimensions because some values
cannot be combined, it allows to explore the space
of possible CS styles systematically.9

writing systems such as Arabic or Persian.

tion (hM) is to mix hL and hR based on some cri-
terion, e.g. the Persian treebank uses hR for coor-
dination of verbs and hL otherwise. For the exper-
iments in Section 5, we choose the head which is
closer to the parent of the whole CS, with the mo-
tivation to make the edge between CS head and its
parent shorter, which may improve parser training.
Attachment of shared modifiers. Shared mod-
ifiers may appear before the first conjunct or after
the last one. Therefore, it seems reasonable to at-
tach shared modifiers either to the CS head (sH),
or to the nearest (i.e. first or last) conjunct (sN).
Attachment of coordinating conjunctions. In
the Moscow family, conjunctions may be either
part of the chain of conjuncts (cB), or they may be
put outside of the chain and attached to the previ-
ous (cP) or following (cF) conjunct. In the Stan-
ford family, conjunctions may be either attached
to the CS head (and therefore between conjuncts)
(cB), or they may be attached to the previous (cP)
or the following (cF) conjunct. The cB option in
both Moscow and Stanford families, treats con-
junctions in the same way as conjuncts (with re-
spect to topology only). In the Prague family, there
is just one option available (cH) – one of the con-
junctions is the CS head while the others are at-
tached to it.
Attachment of punctuation. Punctuation to-
kens separating conjuncts (commas, semicolons
etc.) could be treated the same way as conjunc-
tions. However, in most treebanks it is treated
differently, so we consider it as well. The val-
ues pP, pF and pB are analogous to cP, cF and
cB except that punctuation may be also attached
to the conjunction in case of pP and pF (other-
wise, a comma before the conjunction would be
non-projectively attached to the member follow-
ing the conjunction).
The three established styles mentioned in Sec-
tion 2 can be defined in terms of the newly intro-
duced abbreviations: PS = fPhRsHcHpB, MS =
fMhLsNcBp?, and SS = fShLsNcBp?.13

Most state-of-the-art dependency parsers can pro-

only one label per edge. To fully capture CSs,
we need more than one label, because there are

tions in Section 3): We need to identify the co-
ordinating conjunction (its POS tag might not be
enough), conjuncts, shared modifiers, and punctu-
ation that separates conjuncts. Besides that, there
should be a label classifying the dependency rela-
tion between the CS and its parent.
Some of the information can be retrieved from
the topology of the tree and the “main label” of
each node, but not everything. The additional in-
formation can be attached to the main label, but
such approach obscures the logical structure.
In the Prague family, there are two possible
ways to label a conjunction and conjuncts:
Code dU (“dependency labeled at the upper
level of the CS”). The dependency relation of the
whole CS to its parent is represented by the label
of the conjunction, while the conjuncts are marked
with a special label for conjuncts (e.g. ccof in the
Hyderabad Dependency Treebank).
Code dL (“lower level”). The CS is represented
by a coordinating conjunction (or punctuation if
there is no conjunction) with a special label (e.g.
Coord in PDT). Subsequently, each conjunct has
its own label that reflects the dependency relation
towards the parent of the whole CS, therefore, con-
juncts of the same CS can have different labels,
e.g. “Who[SUBJ] and why[ADV] did it?”
Most Prague family treebanks use sH, i.e.
shared modifiers are attached to the head (coor-
dinating conjunction). Each child of the head has
to belong to one of three sets: conjuncts, shared
modifiers, and punctuation or additional conjunc-
tions. In PDT, conjuncts, punctuation and addi-
tional conjunctions are recognized by specific la-
bels. Any other children of the head are shared
modifiers.
In the Stanford and Moscow families, one of
the conjuncts is the head. In practice, it is never la-
beled as a conjunct explicitly, because the fact that
it is a conjunct can be deduced from the presence
of conjuncts among its children. Usually, the other
conjuncts are labeled as conjuncts; conjunctions
and punctuation also have a special label. This
type of labeling corresponds to the dU type.
Alternatively (as found in the Turkish treebank,
dL), all conjuncts in the Moscow chain have their
own dependency labels and the fact that they are
conjuncts follows from the COORDINATION la-
bels of the conjunction and punctuation nodes be-
tween them.
To represent shared modifiers in the Stan-

ford and Moscow families, an additional label
is needed again to distinguish between private
and shared modifiers since they cannot be distin-
guished topologically. Moreover, if nested CSs
are allowed, a binary label is not sufficient (i.e.
“shared” versus “private”) because it also has to
indicate which conjuncts the shared modifier be-
longs to.14
We use the following binary flag codes for cap-
turing which CS participants are distinguished in
the annotation: m01 = shared modifiers anno-
tated; m10 = conjuncts annotated; m11 = both
annotated; m00 = neither annotated.

In this section, we identify the CS styles defined
in the previous section as used in the primary tree-
bank data sources; statistical observations (such
as the amount of annotated shared modifiers) pre-
sented here, as well as experiments on CS-style
convertibility presented in Section 5.2, are based
on the normalized shapes of the treebanks as con-
tained in the HamleDT 1.0 treebank collection
(Zeman et al., 2012).15
Some of the treebanks were downloaded indi-
vidually from the web, but most of them came
from previously published collections for depen-
dency parsing campaigns: six languages from
CoNLL-2006 (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), seven
languages from CoNLL-2007 (Nivre et al., 2007),
two languages from CoNLL-2009 (Hajiˇc and oth-
ers, 2009), three languages from ICON-2010 (Hu-
sain et al., 2010). Obviously, there is a certain
risk that the CS-related information contained in
the source treebanks was slightly biased by the
properties of the CoNLL format upon conversion.
In addition, many of the treebanks were natively
dependency-based (cf. the 2nd column of Table 1),
but some were originally based on constituents
and thus specific converters to the CoNLL for-
mat had to be created (for instance, the Span-
ish phrase-structure trees were converted to de-
pendencies using a procedure described by Civit
et al. (2006); similarly, treebank-specific convert-
ers have been used for other languages). Again,

nian or Chinese) which are not included in our
study, despite of the fact that constituency tree-
banks do exist for them. The reason is that the
choice of their CS style would be biased, because
no independent converters exist – we would have
to convert them to dependencies ourselves. We
also know about several more dependency tree-
banks that we have not processed yet.
Table 1 shows 26 languages whose treebanks
we have studied from the viewpoint of their CS
styles. It gives the basic quantitative properties of
the treebanks, their CS style in terms of the tax-
onomy introduced in Section 3, as well as statis-
tics related to CSs: the average number of CSs per
100 tokens, the average number of conjuncts per
one CS, the average number of shared modifiers
per one CS,16 and the percentage of nested CSs
among all CSs. The reader can return to Figure
1 to see the basic statistics on the “popularity” of
individual design decisions among the developers
of dependency treebanks or constituency treebank
converters.
CS styles of most treebanks are easily classifi-
able using the codes introduced in Section 3, plus
a few additional codes:

<bodyText confidence="0.992546125">
16All non-Prague family treebanks are marked sN and
m00 or m10, (i.e. shared modifiers not marked in the origi-
nal annotation, but attached to the head conjunct) because we
found no counterexamples (modifiers attached to a conjunct,
but not the nearest one). The HamleDT normalization proce-
dure contains a few heuristics to detect shared modifiers, but
it cannot recover the missing distinction reliably, so the num-
bers in the “SMs/CJ” column are mostly underestimated.

5 Empirical Observations on
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.959407">
Convertibility of Coordination Styles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98544152">
The various styles cannot represent the CS-related
information to the same extent. For example,
it is not possible to represent nested CSs in the
Moscow and Stanford families without signifi-
cantly changing the number of possible labels.17
The dL style (which is most easily applicable to
the Prague family) can represent coordination of
different dependency relations. This is again not
possible in the other styles without adding e.g. a
special “prefix” denoting the relations.
We can see that the Prague family has a greater
expressive power than the other two families: it
can represent complex CSs using just one addi-
tional binary label, distinguishing between shared
modifiers and conjuncts. A similar additional label
is needed in the other styles to distinguish between
shared and private modifiers.
Because of the different expressive power, con-
verting a CS from one style to another may
lead to a loss of information. For example, as
17Mel’ˇcuk uses “grouping” to nest CSs – cf. related so-
lutions involving coindexing or bubble trees (Kahane, 1997).
However, these approaches were not used in any of the re-
searched treebanks. To combine grouping with shared modi-
fiers, each group in a tree should have a different identifier.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996811">

<bodyText confidence="0.9999671">
there is no way of representing shared modifiers
in the Moscow family without an additional at-
tribute, converting a CS with shared modifiers
from Prague to Moscow family makes the modi-
fiers private. When converting back, one can use
certain heuristics to handle the most obvious cases,
but sometimes the modifiers will stay private (very
often, the nature of a modifier depends on context
or is debatable even for humans, e.g. “Young boys
and girls”).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998104">
5.1 Transformation algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99978825">
We developed an algorithm to transform one CS
style to another. Two subtasks must be solved by
the algorithm: identification of individual CSs and
their participants, and transforming of the individ-
ual CSs.
Obviously, the individual CSs cannot be trans-
formed independently because of coordination
nesting. For instance, when transforming a nested
coordination from the Prague style to the Moscow
style (e.g. to fMhL), the leftmost conjunct in the
inner (lower) coordination must climb up to be-
come the head of the inner CS, but then it must
climb up once again to become the head of the
outer (upper) CS too. This shows that inner CSs
must be transformed first.
We tackle this problem by a depth-first recur-
sion. When going down the tree, we only recog-
nize all the participants of the CSs, classify them
and gather them in a separate data structure (one
for each visited CS). The following four types
of CS participants are distinguished: coordinat-
ing conjunctions, conjuncts, shared modifiers, and
punctuations that separate conjuncts.18 No change
of the tree is performed during these descent steps.
When returning back from the recursion (i.e.,
when climbing from a node back up to its par-
ent), we test whether the abandoned node is the
topmost node of some CS. If so, then this CS is
transformed, which means that its participants are
rehanged and relabelled according the the target
CS style.
This procedure naturally guarantees that the in-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.801558888888889">
18Conjuncts are explicitly marked in most styles. Coordi-
nating conjunctions can be usually identified with the help of
dependency labels and POS tags. Punctuation separating con-
juncts can be detected with high accuracy using simple rules.
If shared modifiers are not annotated (code m00 or m10),
one can imagine rule-based heuristics or special classifiers
trained to distinguish shared modifiers. For the experiments
in this section, we use the HamleDT gold annotation attribute
is shared modifier.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999202666666667">
ner CSs are transformed first and that all CSs are
transformed when the recursions returns to the
root.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998648">
5.2 Roundtrip experiment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997475">
The number of possible conversion directions ob-
viously grows quadratically with the number of
styles. So far, we limited ourselves only to con-
versions from/to the style of the HamleDT tree-
bank collection, which contains all the treebanks
under our study already converted into a com-
mon scheme. The common scheme is based
on the conventions of PDT, whose CS style is
fPhRsHcHpB.19
We selected nine styles (3 families times 3 head
choices) and transformed all the HamleDT scheme
treebanks to these nine styles and back, which we
call a roundtrip. Resulting averaged unlabeled at-
tachment scores (UAS, evaluated against the Ham-
leDT scheme) in the last column of Table 1 indi-
cate that the percentage of transformation errors
(i.e. tokens attached to a different parent after the
roundtrip) is lower than 1% for 20 out of the 26
languages.20 A manual inspection revealed two
main error sources. First, as noted above, the Stan-
ford and Moscow families have lower expressive
power than the Prague family, so naturally, the in-
verse transformation was ambiguous and the trans-
formation heuristics were not capable of identify-
ing the correct variant every time. Second, we also
encountered inconsistencies in the original tree-
banks (which we were not trying to fix in Ham-
leDT for now).

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999773142857143">
We described a (theoretically very large) space of
possible representations of CSs within the depen-
dency framework. We pointed out a range of de-
tails that make CSs a really complex phenomenon;
anyone dealing with CSs in treebanking should
take these observations into account.
We proposed a taxonomy of those approaches
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.997057181818182">
19As documented in Zeman et al. (2012), the normalization
procedures used in HamleDT embrace many other phenom-
ena as well (not only those related to coordination), and in-
volve both structural transformation and dependency relation
relabeling.
20Table 1 shows that Latin and Ancient Greek treebanks
have on average more than 6 CSs per 100 tokens, more than
2 conjuncts per CS, and Latin has also the highest number of
shared modifiers per CS. Therefore the percentage of nodes
affected by the roundtrip is the highest for these languages
and the lower roundtrip UAS is not surprising.

that have been argued for in literature or employed
in real treebanks.
We studied 26 existing treebanks of different
languages. For each value of each dimension in
Figure 1, we found at least one treebank where the
value is used; even so, several treebanks take their
own unique path that cannot be clearly classified
under the taxonomy (the taxonomy could indeed
be extended, for the price of being less clearly ar-
ranged).
We discussed the convertibility between the var-
ious styles and implemented a universal tool that
transforms between any two styles of the taxon-
omy. The tool achieves a roundtrip accuracy close
to 100%. This is important because it opens the
door to easily switching coordination styles for
parsing experiments, phrase-to-dependency con-
version etc.
While the focus of this paper is to explore and
describe the expressive power of various annota-
tion styles, we did not address the learnability of
the styles by parsers. That will be a complemen-
tary point of view, and thus a natural direction of
future work for us.

<abstract confidence="0.999565833333333">Paratactic syntactic structures are notoriously difficult to represent in dependency formalisms. This has painful consequences such as high frequency of parsing errors related to coordination. In other words, coordination is a pending problem in dependency analysis of natural languages. This paper tries to shed some light on this area by bringing a systematizing view of various formal means developed for encoding coordination structures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of such approaches and apply it to treebanks across a typologically diverse range of 26 languages. In addition, empirical observations on convertibility between selected styles of representations are shown too.</abstract>

Obviously, there is a certain risk that the CS-related information contained in the source treebanks was slightly biased by the properties of the CoNLL format upon conversion.

Naturally, the interplay of dependency and coordination links in a single tree leads to serious parsing issues.2 The present study does not try to decide which coordination style is the best from the parsing point of view.3 However, we believe that our survey will substantially facilitate experiments in this direction in the future, at least by exploring and describing the space of possible candidates. 2CSs have been reported to be one of the most frequent sources of parsing errors (Green and ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2012; McDonald and Nivre, 2007; K¨ubler et al., 2009; Collins, 2003). Their impact on quality of dependency-based machine translation can also be substantial; as documented on an Englishto-Czech dependency-based translation system (Popel and ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2009), 39% of serious translation errors which are caused by wrong parsing have to do with coordination. 3There might be no such answer, as different CS conventions might serve best for different applications or for different parser architectures. 517 Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 517–527, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c�2013 Association for</context>

Obviously, there is a certain risk that the CS-related information contained in the source treebanks was slightly biased by the properties of the CoNLL format upon conversion. In addition, many of the treebanks were natively dependency-based (cf. the 2nd column of Table 1), but some were originally based on constituents and thus specific converters to the CoNLL format had to be created (for instance, the Spanish phrase-structure trees were converted to dependencies using a procedure described by Civit et al. (2006); similarly, treebank-specific converters have been used for other languages).</context>

We can see that the Prague family has a greater expressive power than the other two families: it can represent complex CSs using just one additional binary label, distinguishing between shared modifiers and conjuncts. A similar additional label is needed in the other styles to distinguish between shared and private modifiers. Because of the different expressive power, converting a CS from one style to another may lead to a loss of information. For example, as 17Mel’ˇcuk uses “grouping” to nest CSs – cf. related solutions involving coindexing or bubble trees (Kahane, 1997). However, these approaches were not used in any of the researched treebanks. To combine grouping with shared modifiers, each group in a tree should have a different identifier. 523 there is no way of representing shared modifiers in the Moscow family without an additional attribute, converting a CS with shared modifiers from Prague to Moscow family makes the modifiers private. When converting back, one can use certain heuristics to handle the most obvious cases, but sometimes the modifiers will stay private (very often, the nature of a modifier depends on context or is debatable even for huma</context>

Section 3 shows possible “styles” for representing CS. Section 4 lists treebanks whose CS conventions we studied. Section 5 presents empirical observations on CS convertibility. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related work Let us first recall the basic well-known characteristics of CSs. In the simplest case of a CS, a coordinating conjunction joins two (usually syntactically and semantically compatible) words or phrases called conjuncts. Even this simplest case is difficult to represent within a dependency tree because, in the words of Lombardo and Lesmo (1998): Dependency paradigms exhibit obvious difficulties with coordination because, differently from most linguistic structures, it is not possible to characterize the coordination construct with a general schema involving a head and some modifiers of it. Proper formal representation of CSs is further complicated by the following facts: • CSs with more than two conjuncts (multiconjunct CSs) exist and are frequent. • Besides “private” modifiers of individual conjuncts, there are modifiers shared by all conjuncts, such as in “Mary came and cried”. Shared modifiers may appear alongside with private mo</context>

Naturally, the interplay of dependency and coordination links in a single tree leads to serious parsing issues.2 The present study does not try to decide which coordination style is the best from the parsing point of view.3 However, we believe that our survey will substantially facilitate experiments in this direction in the future, at least by exploring and describing the space of possible candidates. 2CSs have been reported to be one of the most frequent sources of parsing errors (Green and ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2012; McDonald and Nivre, 2007; K¨ubler et al., 2009; Collins, 2003). Their impact on quality of dependency-based machine translation can also be substantial; as documented on an Englishto-Czech dependency-based translation system (Popel and ˇZabokrtsk´y, 2009), 39% of serious translation errors which are caused by wrong parsing have to do with coordination. 3There might be no such answer, as different CS conventions might serve best for different applications or for different parser architectures. 517 Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 517–527, Sofia, Bulgaria, A</context>

Moreover, particular treebanks vary in their contents even more than in their format, i.e. each treebank has its own way of representing prepositions or different granularity of syntactic labels. 3 Variations in representing coordination structures Our analysis of variations in representing coordination structures is based on observations from a set of dependency treebanks for 26 languages.7 5We use the already established MS-PS-SS distinction to facilitate literature overview; as shown in Section 3, the space of possible coordination styles is much richer. 6For example, TEI (TEI Consortium, 2013), PML (Hana and ˇStˇep´anek, 2012), SynAF (ISO 24615, 2010). 7The primary data sources are the following: Ancient Greek: Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank (Bamman and Crane, 2011), Arabic: Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank 1.0 (Smrˇz et al., 2008), Basque: Basque Dependency Treebank (larger version than CoNLL 2007 generously proIn accordance with the usual conventions, we assume that each sentence is represented by one dependency tree, in which each node corresponds to one token (word or punctuation mark).

One can find various arguments supporting the particular choices. MTT possesses a complex set of linguistic criteria for identifying the governor of a relation (see Mazziotta (2011) for an overview), which lead to MS. MS is preferred in a rule-based dependency parsing system of Lombardo and Lesmo (1998). PS is advocated by ˇStˇep´anek (2006) who claims that it can represent shared modifiers using a single additional binary attribute, while MS would require a more complex co-indexing attribute. An argumentation of Tratz and Hovy (2011) follows a similar direction: We would like to change our [MS] handling of coordinating conjunctions to treat the coordinating conjunction as the head [PS] because this has fewer ambiguities than [MS]... We conclude that the influence of the choice of coordination style is a well-known problem in dependency syntax. Nevertheless, published works usually focus only on a narrow ad-hoc selection of few coordination styles, without giving any systematic perspective. Choosing a file format presents a different problem. Despite various efforts to standardize linguistic annotation,6 no commonly accept</context>
