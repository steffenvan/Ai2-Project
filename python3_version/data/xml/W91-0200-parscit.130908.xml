Preface
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999835818181818">
The recent resurgence of interest in lexical semantics (LS) has brought many linguistic for-
malisms closer to the knowledge representation (KR) languages utilized in AI. In fact, some for-
malisms from computational linguistics are emerging which may be more expressive and formally
better understood than many KR languages. Furthermore, the interests of computational linguists
now extend to include areas previously thought beyond the scope of grammar and linguistics, such
as commonsense knowledge, inheritance, default reasoning, collocational relations, and even do-
main knowledge.
With such an extension of the purview of &amp;quot;linguistic&amp;quot; knowledge, the question emerges as to
whether there is any logical justification for distinguishing between lexical semantics and world
knowledge. The purpose of this workshop is to explore this question in detail, with papers ad-
dressing the following points:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996849">
1. Possible methods for determining what is lexical knowledge and what is outside the scope of
such knowledge.
2. Potential demonstrations that the inferences necessary for language understanding are no
different from supposed non-linguistic inferences.
3. Arguments from language acquisition and general concept development.
4. Cross-linguistic evidence for the specificity of lexical semantic representations.
5. Philosophical arguments for the (impossibility of the) autonomy of lexical knowledge.
6. Theoretical approaches and implemented systems that combine lexical and non-lexical knowl-
edge.

The current volume contains the written versions of the papers and panel positions presented at
the (first) workshop on Lexical Semantics and Knowledge Representation, held at the University
of California, Berkeley, on June 17, 1991, in conjunction with the meeting of the 29th Annual
Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

The organization of a special interest group within the ACL on the lexicon (sIGLEx), has
occasioned the sponsoring of workshops such as the one presented here. There are many people
to thank for making this workshop possible, and for helping to see the proceedings out the door.
Special thanks must first go to Don Walker and the executive committee of the ACL for making
SIGLEX official. Secondly, I would like to thank the other members of the program committee,
Bran Boguraev, Ulrich Reid, Peter Norvig, and Robert Wilensky, for organizational and reviewing
help. I would also like to thank Sabine Bergler for extensive help with preparing the manuscripts
for publication. Finally, Peter Norvig and his stair deserve particular mention, for procuring the
room, food services, and other local arrangements.
