Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999966">
How should we teach Natural Language Processing and/or Computational Lin-
guistics? Throughout the forty year history of the organization, many ACL
members have responded to this question, finding solutions appropriate to a
huge range of different local contexts. The ensuing diversity in approach is in
some ways extremely welcome, but could be isolating for the individual instruc-
tor. This workshop is a forum for sharing of useful tools and experience.
We work in an &amp;quot;interface discipline&amp;quot;. Most of our work is collaborative and
multidisciplinary, and this has immediate consequences for training. If we are
doing our job, we should be able to answer — or at least address — most of the
following questions.

<listItem confidence="0.968749857142857">
• Is there a common core of knowledge and capability that should be part
of the training of all NLP/CL students, or are the differences in emphasis
between the contributing disciplines so large that this is unrealistic?
• Does it work well to shoehorn NLP/CL into niches in linguistics, CS or
EE, or is it preferable to set up new departments and cross-cutting re-
search centres? If the latter, what is the strategy for making sure that our
students have a good onward trajectory into more conventional academic
contexts.
• Should we be advising linguists to learn algorithmic complexity, speech
engineers to bone up on Montague semantics or computer scientists inter-
ested in language to learn phonetics? If so, how can we make palatable
the inevitable extra work, if not, what other advice should we offer?
• Which subfields of NLP/CL do we judge to have the most important long
term research and employment potential? If we know that we may be

better placed to understand and respond to the educational needs of the
students and researchers who will create the future of our subject .
We can expect the detailed answers to these questions to be site-specific, but
we are siure that there are also general insights that can help us all to make
our teaching relevant to and supportive of the long term goals of the CL/NLP
community. These issues are noticed by many, but little discussed, and often
solved individually on an ad-hoc basis. The point of this workshop is to facilitate
sharing and discussion, and to act as a seed for a community of research and
scholarship in the teaching of NLP.
This workshop was made possible, in part, by grant #0226408 from the
National Science Foundation. We are also grateful for contributions of time
and effort from many people, especially Mary Taffet, Lillian Lee, Jason Eisner,
Robert Dale and the whole of the program committee. We are grateful to them
(and you) for your willingness to spend time on developing an effective and
relevant scholarship of teaching for NLP and CL.
