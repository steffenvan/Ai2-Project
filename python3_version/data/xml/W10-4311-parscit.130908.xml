<bodyText confidence="0.999772">
This study investigates the use of Same – a
relation that connects the parts of a
discontinuous discourse segment – in the
Discourse Graphbank (Wolf et al., 2004). Our
analysis reveals systematic deviations from
the definition of the Same relation and a
substantial number of confusions between
Same and Elaboration relations. We discuss
some methodological and theoretical
implications of these findings.

Coherence relations and their composition
(usually assumed to be strictly hierarchical, i.e.,
treelike) form the core of most corpus-linguistic
and computational work on discourse structure
(see Taboada &amp; Mann 2006 for an overview). The
assumption that discourse structure can be
modeled as a tree has recently come under attack
e.g. in Wolf &amp; Gibson (2003, 2006; henceforth
WG). Based on the Discourse Graphbank (Wolf
et al 2004; henceforth DG), a manually annotated
corpus of 135 newspaper and newswire texts,
WG claim that less constrained graph structures
are needed that allow for crossed dependencies
(i.e. structures in which discourse units ABCD
(not necessarily adjacent) have relations AC and
BD) and multiple-parent structures (where a unit
enters more than one coherence relation and is
thus dominated by more than one node).1
Among the 11 types of relations distinguished
in DG, the Elaboration relation, where two
asymmetrically related discourse units are
“centered around a common event of entity”(Wolf

et al 2003: 12), stands out by its heavy
involvement in these violations of tree structure
constraints. Elaboration relations are involved in
50.52% of all crossed dependency structures and
in 45.83% of multiple-parent structures. These
high percentages are in part due to the high
overall frequency of Elaboration relations
(37.97% of all relations), but clearly exceed that
base rate. Elsewhere, Elaboration relations, esp.
those where the elaborandum is an entity and not
a whole proposition, have been criticized as
belonging more to referential coherence than to
relational coherence (Knott el at 2001). In this
study, we show that WG’s (somewhat
idiosyncratic) definition of the Elaboration
relation seems to lead to confusion with the
&apos;pseudo-relation&apos; Same.
The ‘pseudo-relation’ Same-Unit was
introduced by Marcu (Carlson &amp; Marcu 2001) to
deal with discontinuous discourse units in the
RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson, Marcu &amp;
Okurowski 2002). Same-Unit (re)connects the
parts of a discourse unit that is disrupted by
embedded material. In the tree representation,
the intervening material is attached to one of the
constituent units of the Same-Unit relation
(Carlson &amp; Marcu 2001:23-26). In DG, this
relation is called Same and accounts for 17.21%
of all relations; only Elaboration and Similarity
are more frequent.2 As DG allows multiple
attachments, Same should be expected to be
regularly associated with multiple-parent
structures, and it is: the percentage of Same
relations is higher in multiple-parent structures
than overall, and the reduction of multiple-

RST, where parenthetical segments are extracted and

removed from the DG is second only to
Elaboration (Wolf &amp; Gibson 2003:280-282).
Our explorations of Same relations in DG
revealed a substantial number of cases that do not
seem to fit WG’s definition of this relation, most
notably confusions with Elaboration relations and
a surprising number of cases where there is no
intervening segment to be bridged by the Same
relation. In this paper, we will present these
findings and discuss some consequences for
discourse segmentation and the annotation of
coherence relations.

2 Same relations in DG

<bodyText confidence="0.999969533333333">
The DG coding manual (Wolf et al 2003:15)
stipulates as the only condition for a Same
relation that a discourse segment must have
“intervening material”. The example in the
manual tacitly fits the much more restrictive
definition given in (Wolf &amp; Gibson 2003:255)
and in (Wolf &amp; Gibson 2006:28):
“A same relation holds if a subject NP is
separated from its predicate by an intervening
discourse segment”.
Among the 534 Same relations in DG,3 we
have identified 128 cases (23.98%) where this
definition does not seem to apply. Sixty-four of
these cases also do not satisfy the broader
definition in the coding manual (see 2.3).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99588">
2.1 Same or Elaboration?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972563115384615">
In 35 cases, the Same relation is applied to
constructions that are elsewhere labeled
Elaborations. Consider the parallel examples (1)
and (2):
(1) [42]–[44] elab-loc
[42] There, [43] she said,
[44] robots perform specific
tasks in “islands of
automation,” (Text 1)
(2)[32]–[34] same
[32] In the factory of the
future, [33] according to the
university&apos;s model, [34]
human chatter will be
replaced by the click-clack
of machines. (Text 1)
3We have arbitrarily chosen to use the data for annotator 1.
The two annotators agreed on segmentation and annotation
in 98% of the cases.
In these examples, [42] and [32] each specify
a location for the state of affairs expressed in the
second constituent of the relation, [44] and [34]
respectively. Note that [32] is not a subject NP
and example (2) thus violates the restricted
variant of the Same relation definition.
Interestingly, examples (1) and (2) differ with
respect to the involvement in crossed
dependencies and multiple-parent structures. As
expected from an elaborating segment, [42] does
not participate in any other relations; the three
other relations [44] participates in do not include
[42]. By contrast, [32] is attached to the
intervening segment and in eight other relations
in which not [34] by itself, but the combined
segment [32]–[34] participates.
In other examples, a general difference
between these Same and Elaboration examples
lies in the attachment of the intervening
segment: in the Same cases, the intervening
segment might be attached to the preceding
discourse segment, and in the Elaboration cases
to the following segment.
The confusion between the symmetric Same
relation (both segments have in principle equal
status) and the asymmetric Elaboration relation
(combining an elaborandum with a less central
elaborating segment) might have been caused by
WG’s definition, which stipulates that the
segments be “centered around a common event
or entity” (Wolf et al 2003: 12) and thus does
not reflect the asymmetry of the Elaboration
relation.

There are other cases, besides those discussed in
2.1, where the formal requirement of the
restrictive definition is not met. In 20 cases, the
Same relations joins coordinated or disjoint NP&apos;s
as in example (3):

We found 64 cases in DG where Same is assigned
to two adjacent discourse segments, thus violating
the essential criterion of “intervening material”.
Such ‘spurious’ Same relations occur with various
constructions including the following:

The 64 spurious Same relations are
concentrated in only 20 of the 135 texts. Fifty-one
of those cases occur in ten texts that were also
used in the RST Discourse Treebank. This gives
us the interesting opportunity to compare the
DG and RST Treebank analyses for these 51
cases. As Table 1 shows, only two of them are
labeled Same-Unit in the RST Treebank, while
26 (51%) are Elaboration relations.

It is instructive to look at the subtype of
Elaboration assigned to these cases, which most
commonly is the relation Elaboration-object-
attribute-e. It applies to clausal modifiers,
usually postmodifiers of a noun phrase, that
express an intrinsic quality of an object. Carlson
&amp; Marcu (2001:55) illustrate this relation with
the following example:

<bodyText confidence="0.9996728">
The constructions with spurious Same
relations in DG thus often involve restrictive
modification, implying a very close tie between
the segments involved, possibly prompting the
annotators to as it were undo the segmentation.

<bodyText confidence="0.9993534">
Any annotation of discourse relations requires
rules for segmenting the text into elementary
discourse units. DG follows Carlson &amp; Marcu
(2003) in assuming clauses, modifiers and
attributions as discourse segments (DSs), but
adds some “refinements” (Wolf et al., 2003:8)
that may be responsible for some of the
problematic cases discussed in section 2.4 In
particular, two of the additional stipulations refer
to “elaborations”:

This might simply be an unfortunate
equivocation, but still is likely to confuse

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991212121212">
Our analysis of the Same relation in DG has
shown systematic deviations from the definition
of this (pseudo-)relation and a substantial number
of confusions between Same and Elaboration,
both in cases where Same cannot apply, as there
is no intervening segment, and in cases where
both might apply, but parsimony would demand
to treat parallel cases equally. Some of the
problematic cases may have been caused by the
use of relational terminology (“elaboration”) in
two of the segmentation rules. The problems are
not just methodological, though, but may raise
questions about the conceptual status of
Elaboration relations.
The confusion of a bone fide coherence
relation with a purely technical construction that
serves to recombine the parts of an interrupted
segment must be worrisome. More specifically,
the comparison with the annotation in the RST
Discourse Treebank reveals that many of the
‘spurious’ Same relations in DG are analyzed as
Elaboration-object-attribute-e relations in the
RST Treebank. This is exactly the subcategory of
Elaboration relations that most clearly operate on
the level of entities instead of propositions, and
thus arguably might not be proper discourse
relations (Knott et al. 2001). This holds a fortiori
as Carlson &amp; Marcu’s (2001) definition of the
Elaboration-object-attribute-e relation requires a
restrictive modifier construction. The increasing
availability of corpora annotated for discourse
structure will facilitate the further investigation of
these questions.

The assumption that discourse structure can be modeled as a tree has recently come under attack e.g. in Wolf &amp; Gibson (2003, 2006; henceforth WG).

Our explorations of Same relations in DG revealed a substantial number of cases that do not seem to fit WG’s definition of this relation, most notably confusions with Elaboration relations and a surprising number of cases where there is no intervening segment to be bridged by the Same relation. In this paper, we will present these findings and discuss some consequences for discourse segmentation and the annotation of coherence relations. 2 Same relations in DG The DG coding manual (Wolf et al 2003:15) stipulates as the only condition for a Same relation that a discourse segment must have “intervening material”. The example in the manual tacitly fits the much more restrictive definition given in (Wolf &amp; Gibson 2003:255) and in (Wolf &amp; Gibson 2006:28): “A same relation holds if a subject NP is separated from its predicate by an intervening discourse segment”. Among the 534 Same relations in DG,3 we have identified 128 cases (23.98%) where this definition does not seem to apply. Sixty-four of these cases also do not satisfy the broader definition in the coding manual (see 2.3). 2.1 Same o</context>

The confusion between the symmetric Same relation (both segments have in principle equal status) and the asymmetric Elaboration relation (combining an elaborandum with a less central elaborating segment) might have been caused by WG’s definition, which stipulates that the segments be “centered around a common event or entity” (Wolf et al 2003: 12) and thus does not reflect the asymmetry of the Elaboration relation. 2.2 Violations of definitional constraints There are other cases, besides those discussed in 2.1, where the formal requirement of the restrictive definition is not met. In 20 cases, the Same relations joins coordinated or disjoint NP&apos;s as in example (3): (3) [13]–[16] same [13] Mrs. Price&apos;s husband, [14] Everett Price, [15] 63, [16] and their daughters, (Text 2) In 12 cases, Same is used to relate a discourse connective to its host clause as in (4): (4) [4]–[6] same [4] However, [5] after two meetings with the Soviets, </context>

DG follows Carlson &amp; Marcu (2003) in assuming clauses, modifiers and attributions as discourse segments (DSs), but adds some “refinements” (Wolf et al., 2003:8) that may be responsible for some of the problematic cases discussed in section 2.4 In particular, two of the additional stipulations refer to “elaborations”: 4 A different account of the segmentation is given in (Wolf &amp; Gibson 2006), but the annotation in DG is presumably based on the 2003 manual. 65 “Elaborations [..] are separate DSs: [ Mr. Jones, ][ spokesman for IBM, ] [ said... ]” (Wolf et al., 2003:8) “Time-, space-, personal- or detailelaborations are treated as DSs” (Wolf et al., 2003:9).
