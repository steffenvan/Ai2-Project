<bodyText confidence="0.94907815">
We propose a draft scheme of the model formalizing
the structure of communicative context in dialogue
Interaction. The relationships between the interact-
ing partners are considered as system of three auto-
mata representing the partners of the dialogue and
environment.
The aannunicative canpetence of the partners is de-
fined by
- the set M of all propositions reflecting the
possible states of the three automata within the
model;
- the set K of &amp;quot;contracts&amp;quot; representing all
kinds of human-to4mman relationships (social, in-
terpersonal, professional, etc.) which include
fixation of particular roles for the partners;
- the set T of possible topics, related to
given &amp;quot;contract &amp;quot;.
The authors believe the system of the notions pre-
sented may be used as a basis for forming the commu-
nicative component in the dialogue system.

The elaboration of advanced user-computer dialogue
systems requires the canmunication laws to be inves-
tigated and formalized. This domain of research has
not yet been officially acknowledged as a part of
computational linguistics. However, developing the
formal models of speech interaction requires to
take into account not only linguistic but conmunica-
tive competence also. That is necessary for creat-
ing natural-language systems as well as any compli-
cated system of &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; dialogue, and especially
important in view of constructing new generation
computers intended for mass non-programming users.
We propose here a draft sdheme of the model formaliz-
ing the structure of communicative context in dia-
logue interaction. The relationships between the in-
teracting partners are considered as a system of
three automata. Two of them represent the agents of
the dialogue and the third one is a model of the
world including the enviroment of interaction and
other agents if they participate. The automaton-agent
is the central component of the communicative compe-
tence model. We divide memory of each agent into
extraccumunicative and oommunicative parts. The lat-
ter directly concerns with the relationships between
the agents in projection onto the interaction pro-
cess.
Two restrictions have been accepted to simplify the
model.

<listItem confidence="0.9848725">
(a) Cannunicative competences of both the agents,
i.e. their beliefs about communication laws and ac-
tual state of their relations are identical just up
to current cannunicative act (CA) because the con-
tents of the act (including the communicative con-
tents) at the moment of its producing is known to
the speaker only.
(b) Receiver extracts from CA just the same informa-
tion the speaker implies.
2. INITIAL rpriorts
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997976108108108">
We shall introduce necessary notions and notations.
Let (MI be a set of all propositions reflecting
the possible states of the three automata within
the model, and M be a memory representing the
agents&apos; mutually coordinated beliefs about the
world. State of M at moment T (i.e. M,) is a
consistent subset of propositions from OM, each
of which being characterized by index of certainty.
The machinery of interaction between the agents is
dominated byasystem of contracts. Here
contracts represent all kinds of human-to-human re-
lationships (social, interpersonal, business, etc.)
For example, &amp;quot;chief-subordinate&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;official-client&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;married couple&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;patron-ward&amp;quot;, etc.
Contract is represented with a tuple
k, 3f, Y, Coed, Coed-Act, Cond-Des, T,
where
k is a name of contract;
X and Y are roles of partners X and Y in the
contract;
Coed, COnd-Act and Coed-Des are consistent
subsets of propositions from (MI, called general
conditions, conditions of activation and conditions
of deqartivation of the contract, respectively;
T is a set of interaction topics related to
given contract.
The interaction between the agents is realized by
means of communicative acts (CA), in particular,
of speech acts. Every CA is characterized with roles
(author-receiver), aim, topic and value of phase
function indicating the relation between CA and the
topic (CA can be initiating, continuing, closing
and re-initiating in respect to its topic). A sub-
sequence of coherent cortmunicative acts connected
with the same topic is calledat-interac t-
i n g. Discourse is considered as a system of em-
bedded t-interactings. The simplest t-interacting

may consist of a single CA which simultaneously
initiates and closes its own topic (for example,
CA requiring no reaction from the receiver). Topic
is represented here by the following tuple
t, X, Y, Cond, Alm, Scr, Cnsq,
where
t is a name of topic;
Y and Cond have the same meaning as for
contract in the above definition;
Scr isaset of scripts of t-inter-
actings which realize the topic t (a script is
either a single CA being the simplest t-interact-
ing mentioned above or a chain of correlated em-
bedded subtopics, respectively); the scripts in
Scr may be just listed or/and specified by means
of a formal generative procedure;
Cnsq is a set of all possible consequences
of closing t, i.e. a set of modifications of the
memory M resulting from t-interactings which rea-
lize the potential scripts of Scr;
Aim is a subset of Cnsq which conventionally
is considered as the aim of agent initiating the
topic t.
Initiating some topic t the agent chooses some
script from Scr he plans to realize; in general
case a script allows several possible continuations
at every intermediate point of its realization,
one of these continuations corresponds to the
script the agent plans to realize at the given mo-
ment.

3. COMMUNICATIVE CONTEXT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9333805">
Thus the communicative competence of the agents
is defined by the set {M) of propositions, the
set (K) of contracts and the set (T) of topics
possible for X and Y. To demonstrate the func-
tioning of our model we shall consider the compo-
nent of M related directly to the process of com-
munication. This comuonent being called Communica-
tive Context (CC), includes:
- a set TT of current topics, i.e. the topics
initiated before a moment i and not closed yet,
to each topic t E T current script of its reali-
zation is put in correspondence. The topics belong-
ing to TT are hierarchically embedded so that
the topic t is embedded into the topic t&apos; (or t&apos;
is on higher level than t) if t is initiated
according to the current script of t&apos;; a current
topic/script which CAT..1 belongs to,will be re-
ferred as actual topic/script;
- a set KT of contracts being in the activated
state for the agent at the moment T;
- a subset +Ktc KT of contracts related to
the topics included in TT; i.e. the contracts im-
mediately related to the contents of the interac-
tion.
The transformation of KT is defined by the fol-
lowing rules (for each k E K);
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99072125">
(a) if Cond-Act (Dir) and k E KT is true, than
the contract k is included into
(b) if (k E KT)8.(Condk(MT)=false), i.e. conditions
of the contract k are not fulfilled, the contract
k is excluded from Kr+1;
(c) if Cond-Desk(MT)&amp;k E KT is true, the contract
k is excluded from K1+1; it does not mean that
Cond-Desk(MT)- NO Condk(MT) takes place.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995533853658537">
The rules (a) and (b) require Cond-Actk(MT)-
-.Condkay. .
For the contracts in K a system of relations
can be defined, for example: contracts kl and k2
are mutually incompatible if
Condki&amp;Condkrfalse; kl is n comp a-
tible with k2 if (k2EKTVCOndk2(MT))
▪ (Cond-Deski (mT)- V NO Condktkl implies k2 if
(CondkiV Ccnd-Actki).. C0na-Actk2 or klEKt,Cond-
-Actk2(MT).
The main scheme of the considered machinery of com-
munication can be described as follows. A current
state MIT causes agent (X) to set some goal; X
forms a plan to achieve the goal and begins to rea-
lize it. Some step of X&apos;s plan demands to involve
the partner Y: to perform definite action or to
accept same proposition as valid or to provide in-
formation needed, etc. To get this result is the
aim of X at the given step of this plan. To gain
the aim, X should choose an appropriate topic
(one of the topics with this aim). In the simplest
case it is possible to use just the next topic t
in the script of the higher level topic with an
aim being more general in the X&apos;s plan than the
current one. In this situation initiating the sub-
topic t produces minimal modification of CC
(which is adding t to T) and does not modify the
set K of the activated contracts and its subset
+K. In more complex cases to initiate an appropri-
te topic t it is necessary to include in +1‹ one
of contracts from K/41( or even to activate some
new contract k&apos;, i.e. to include k&apos; in K. Clos-
ing a current topic t may produce same consequen-
ces from Cnsq with the corresponding modifica-
tion of M which can lead to
- the end of communication,
- a new goal for X and/or Y,
- moving to the next subgoal in the current plan.
In the next section we shall consider the spectrum
of possible situations related with realization of
current CA.

4. MODELLING THE PROCESS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999091571428572">
Each current act CA, may be initiating, continu-
ing or closing with respect to embedding topic t
belonging to TT.
The initiation of the topic t by CAT may corres-
pond to three different types of situations: &amp;quot;nor-
mal order&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;interruption with return&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;inter-
ruption without return&amp;quot;.
(a) Normal order covers the following situations:
- the previous act CAT-1 has closed the topic
and the topic t is the next in the script the to-
pic t&apos; belongs to; if t&apos; closes simultaneously
several consecutively embedded topics, then t is
the next topic of the script of the lowest unclosed
topic;
- CAT_1 has closed one of the highest-level to-
pics belonging to TT- 1, then (i) t belongs to
one of the contracts fram 4*KT_I or (ii) the contr-
act k has been activated, but not included into
+K (i.e. k E Kt/y, or (iii) t activates
a new contract k EtK) and includes it into KT
and +KT (that is possible if the initiation of t

at moment r leads to fulfillment COnd-Actk(MT);
(b) Interruption with return covers the following
situations: the topic of the act CAT-1 has no::
been closed yet, but t is another topic of the
same or another contract; if a change of topic is
marked by &amp;quot;interruption with return&amp;quot;, then this
&amp;quot;deviation&amp;quot; is necessary either (i) for continuing
the Interrupted topic (return after some previous
interruption), or (ii) for the realization of the
high-priority aim related to the new topic t;
(c) interruption without return covers the situa-
tions described in (b) but without the &amp;quot;return&amp;quot;
mark as well as the following situation: the topic
of the act CAT..1 is not closed and t is the
next topic of the same or higher-level script; the
interruption without return usually means by de-
fault that the interrupted topic is considered to
be closed with success or failure depending on the
interrupted and new topics).
The act CAT continued actual topic t may be rea-
lized in situations related to the normal order or
to the return after interruption.
(a) normal order means that CAT continues the
topic of the previous act CAT-1;
(0) return after interruption means that CA, con-
tinues the topic remained to be unclosed under &amp;quot;the
interruption with return&amp;quot;. The topic t being
closed by the act CAT, same or all modifications
listed in Cnsgt take place in the memory M. These
modifications reflected in Mr.,./ can cause the fol-
lowing situations:

<listItem confidence="0.86709325">
(a) KT-1.1 = KT, i.e. no contracts are activated or
desactivated, the current script of the actual to-
pic and higher-level topics are not alternated;
(b) = KT, but one/some of the current scripts
are alternated;
(c) contract k is closed (i.e. Cond-Desk(MT+1) =
truth);
(d) other contracts are closed and/or activated.

COMMUNICATIVE CONTEXT Thus the communicative competence of the agents is defined by the set {M) of propositions, the contracts and the set (T) of topics possible for X and Y. To demonstrate the functioning of our model we shall consider the component of M related directly to the process of communication. This comuonent being called Communicative Context (CC), includes: a set of current the topics initiated before a moment i and not closed yet, each topic t current script of its realization is put in correspondence. The topics belongto are hierarchically embedded so that the topic t is embedded into the topic t&apos; (or t&apos; is on higher level than t) if t is initiated according to the current script of t&apos;; a current which belongs to,will be referred as actual topic/script; a set of contracts being in the activated for the agent at the moment a subset of contracts related topics included in i.e. the contracts immediately related to the contents of the interaction. transformation of is defined by the folrules (for each k if Cond-Act k is true, than the contract k is included into if E i.e. conditions of the contract k are not fulfilled, the contract from if is true, the contract is excluded from it does not mean that Cond-Desk(MT)- NO Condk(MT) takes place. rules (a) and (b) require -.Condkay. .

Some step of X&apos;s plan demands to involve the partner Y: to perform definite action or to accept same proposition as valid or to provide information needed, etc. To get this result is the aim of X at the given step of this plan. To gain the aim, X should choose an appropriate topic (one of the topics with this aim). In the simplest it is possible to the next topic t in the script of the higher level topic with an aim being more general in the X&apos;s plan than the current one. In this situation initiating the subtopic t produces minimal modification of CC (which is adding t to T) and does not modify the set K of the activated contracts and its subset +K. In more complex cases to initiate an approprite topic t it is necessary to include in +1‹ one contracts from or even to activate some new contract k&apos;, i.e. to include k&apos; in K. Closing a current topic t may produce same consequences from Cnsq with the corresponding modification of M which can lead to the end of communication, a new goal for X and/or Y, moving next subgoal in the current plan. In the next section we shall consider the spectrum of possible situations related with realization of current CA. 4. MODELLING THE PROCESS Each current act CA, may be initiating, continuor closing with respect to embedding to initiation of the topic t by may correspond to three different types of situations: &amp;quot;normal order&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;interruption with return&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;interruption without return&amp;quot;. (a) Normal order covers the following situations: the previous act has closed the topic and the topic t is the next in the script the topic t&apos; belongs to; if t&apos; closes simultaneously several consecutively embedded topics, then t is the next topic of the script of the lowest unclosed topic; has closed one of the highest-level toto 1, belongs to of the contracts fram or contract k has been activated, but not included into (i.e. k or (iii) t activates new contract k includes it into (that is possible if the initiation of t 275 moment r leads to fulfillment (b) Interruption with return covers the following the topic of the act has no:: been closed yet, but t is another topic of the same or another contract; if a change of topic is marked by &amp;quot;interruption with return&amp;quot;, then this &amp;quot;deviation&amp;quot; is necessary either (i) for continuing the Interrupted topic (return after some previous interruption), or (ii) for the realization of the high-priority aim related to the new topic t; (c) interruption without return covers the situations described in (b) but without the &amp;quot;return&amp;quot; mark as well as the following situation: the topic the act is not closed and t is the next topic of the same or higher-level script; the interruption without return usually means by default that the interrupted topic is considered to be closed with success or failure depending on the interrupted and new topics). act continued actual topic t may be realized in situations related to the normal order or to the return after interruption. normal order means that continues the of the previous act (0) return after interruption means that CA, continues the topic remained to be unclosed under &amp;quot;the interruption with return&amp;quot;. The topic t being by the act same or all modifications listed in Cnsgt take place in the memory M. These reflected in can cause the following situations: KT-1.1 = no contracts are activated or desactivated, the current script of the actual topic and higher-level topics are not alternated; = one/some of the current scripts are alternated; contract k is closed (i.e. = truth); (d) other contracts are closed and/or activated. The work presented is the part of the integral project on the language interaction model being elaborated in our laboratory. The authors believe the system of the notions presented may be used as a basis for forming the communicative component in the dialogue systems including the natural-language interfaces. REFERENCES 1.
