Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.998586086956522">
Cross-language document summarization is a
task of producing a summary in one language
for a document set in a different language. Ex-
isting methods simply use machine translation
for document translation or summary transla-
tion. However, current machine translation
services are far from satisfactory, which re-
sults in that the quality of the cross-language
summary is usually very poor, both in read-
ability and content. In this paper, we propose
to consider the translation quality of each sen-
tence in the English-to-Chinese cross-language
summarization process. First, the translation
quality of each English sentence in the docu-
ment set is predicted with the SVM regression
method, and then the quality score of each sen-
tence is incorporated into the summarization
process. Finally, the English sentences with
high translation quality and high informative-
ness are selected and translated to form the
Chinese summary. Experimental results dem-
onstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the
proposed approach.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999978214285714">
Given a document or document set in one source
language, cross-language document summariza-
tion aims to produce a summary in a different
target language. In this study, we focus on Eng-
lish-to-Chinese document summarization for the
purpose of helping Chinese readers to quickly
understand the major content of an English docu-
ment or document set. This task is very impor-
tant in the field of multilingual information ac-
cess.
Till now, most previous work focuses on
monolingual document summarization, but
cross-language document summarization has re-
ceived little attention in the past years. A
straightforward way for cross-language docu-
ment summarization is to translate the summary
from the source language to the target language
by using machine translation services. However,
though machine translation techniques have been
advanced a lot, the machine translation quality is
far from satisfactory, and in many cases, the
translated texts are hard to understand. Therefore,
the translated summary is likely to be hard to
understand by readers, i.e., the summary quality
is likely to be very poor. For example, the trans-
lated Chinese sentence for an ordinary English
sentence (“It is also Mr Baker who is making the
most of presidential powers to dispense lar-
gesse.”) by using Google Translate is “n时,th
是贝克是谁提出了对总统权力免除最慷慨。”.
The translated sentence is hard to understand
because it contains incorrect translations and it is
very disfluent. If such sentences are selected into
the summary, the quality of the summary would
be very poor.
In order to address the above problem, we
propose to consider the translation quality of the
English sentences in the summarization process.
In particular, the translation quality of each Eng-
lish sentence is predicted by using the SVM re-
gression method, and then the predicted MT
quality score of each sentence is incorporated
into the sentence evaluation process, and finally
both informative and easy-to-translate sentences
are selected and translated to form the Chinese
summary.
An empirical evaluation is conducted to evalu-
ate the performance of machine translation qual-
ity prediction, and a user study is performed to
evaluate the cross-language summary quality.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows:

Machine translation evaluation aims to assess the
correctness and quality of the translation. Usu-
ally, the human reference translation is provided,
and various methods and metrics have been de-
veloped for comparing the system-translated text
and the human reference text. For example, the
BLEU metric, the NIST metric and their relatives
are all based on the idea that the more shared
substrings the system-translated text has with the
human reference translation, the better the trans-
lation is. Blatz et al. (2003) investigate training
sentence-level confidence measures using a vari-
ety of fuzzy match scores. Albrecht and Hwa
(2007) rely on regression algorithms and refer-
ence-based features to measure the quality of
sentences.
Transition evaluation without using reference
translations has also been investigated. Quirk
(2004) presents a supervised method for training
a sentence level confidence measure on transla-
tion output using a human-annotated corpus.
Features derived from the source sentence and
the target sentence (e.g. sentence length, perplex-
ity, etc.) and features about the translation proc-
ess are leveraged. Gamon et al. (2005) investi-
gate the possibility of evaluating MT quality and
fluency at the sentence level in the absence of
reference translations, and they can improve on
the correlation between language model perplex-
ity scores and human judgment by combing these
perplexity scores with class probabilities from a
machine-learned classifier. Specia et al. (2009)
use the ICM theory to identify the threshold to
map a continuous predicted score into “good” or
“bad” categories. Chae and Nenkova (2009) use
surface syntactic features to assess the fluency of
machine translation results.
In this study, we further predict the translation
quality of an English sentence before the ma-
chine translation process, i.e., we do not leverage
reference translation and the target sentence.

2.2 Document Summarization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999536237288136">
Document summarization methods can be gener-
ally categorized into extraction-based methods
and abstraction-based methods. In this paper, we
focus on extraction-based methods. Extraction-
based summarization methods usually assign
each sentence a saliency score and then rank the
sentences in a document or document set.
For single document summarization, the sen-
tence score is usually computed by empirical
combination of a number of statistical and lin-
guistic feature values, such as term frequency,
sentence position, cue words, stigma words,
topic signature (Luhn 1969; Lin and Hovy, 2000).
The summary sentences can also be selected by
using machine learning methods (Kupiec et al.,
1995; Amini and Gallinari, 2002) or graph-based
methods (ErKan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and
Tarau, 2004). Other methods include mutual re-
inforcement principle (Zha 2002; Wan et al.,
2007).
For multi-document summarization, the cen-
troid-based method (Radev et al., 2004) is a typi-
cal method, and it scores sentences based on
cluster centroids, position and TFIDF features.
NeATS (Lin and Hovy, 2002) makes use of new
features such as topic signature to select impor-
tant sentences. Machine Learning based ap-
proaches have also been proposed for combining
various sentence features (Wong et al., 2008).
The influences of input difficulty on summariza-
tion performance have been investigated in
(Nenkova and Louis, 2008). Graph-based meth-
ods have also been used to rank sentences in a
document set. For example, Mihalcea and Tarau
(2005) extend the TextRank algorithm to com-
pute sentence importance in a document set.
Cluster-level information has been incorporated
in the graph model to better evaluate sentences
(Wan and Yang, 2008). Topic-focused or query
biased multi-document summarization has also
been investigated (Wan et al., 2006). Wan et al.
(2010) propose the EUSUM system for extract-
ing easy-to-understand English summaries for
non-native readers.
Several pilot studies have been performed for
the cross-language summarization task by simply
using document translation or summary transla-
tion. Leuski et al. (2003) use machine translation
for English headline generation for Hindi docu-
ments. Lim et al. (2004) propose to generate a
Japanese summary without using a Japanese
summarization system, by first translating Japa-
nese documents into Korean documents, and
then extracting summary sentences by using Ko-
rean summarizer, and finally mapping Korean
summary sentences to Japanese summary sen-
tences. Chalendar et al. (2005) focuses on se-
mantic analysis and sentence generation tech-
niques for cross-language summarization. Orasan

and Chiorean (2008) propose to produce summa-
ries with the MMR method from Romanian news
articles and then automatically translate the
summaries into English. Cross language query
based summarization has been investigated in
(Pingali et al., 2007), where the query and the
documents are in different languages. Other re-
lated work includes multilingual summarization
(Lin et al., 2005), which aims to create summa-
ries from multiple sources in multiple languages.
Siddharthan and McKeown (2005) use the in-
formation redundancy in multilingual input to
correct errors in machine translation and thus
improve the quality of multilingual summaries.

3 The Proposed Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.889444407407408">
Previous methods for cross-language summariza-
tion usually consist of two steps: one step for
summarization and one step for translation. Dif-
ferent order of the two steps can lead to the fol-
lowing two basic English-to-Chinese summariza-
tion methods:
Late Translation (LateTrans): Firstly, an
English summary is produced for the English
document set by using existing summarization
methods. Then, the English summary is auto-
matically translated into the corresponding Chi-
nese summary by using machine translation ser-
vices.
Early Translation (EarlyTrans): Firstly, the
English documents are translated into Chinese
documents by using machine translation services.
Then, a Chinese summary is produced for the
translated Chinese documents.
Generally speaking, the LateTrans method has
a few advantages over the EarlyTrans method:
1) The LateTrans method is much more effi-
cient than the EarlyTrans method, because only a
very few summary sentences are required to be
translated in the LateTrans method, whereas all
the sentences in the documents are required to be
translated in the EarlyTrans method.
2) The LateTrans method is deemed to be
more effective than the EarlyTrans method, be-
cause the translation errors of the sentences have
great influences on the summary sentence extrac-
tion in the EarlyTrans method.
Thus in this study, we adopt the LateTrans
method as our baseline method. We also adopt
the late translation strategy for our proposed ap-
proach.
In the baseline method, a translated Chinese
sentence is selected into the summary because
the original English sentence is informative.
However, an informative and fluent English sen-
tence is likely to be translated into an uninforma-
tive and disfluent Chinese sentence, and there-
fore, this sentence cannot be selected into the
summary.
In order to address the above problem of exist-
ing methods, our proposed approach takes into
account a novel factor of each sentence for cross-
language summary extraction. Each English sen-
tence is associated with a score indicating its
translation quality. An English sentence with
high translation quality score is more likely to be
selected into the original English summary, and
such English summary can be translated into a
better Chinese summary. Figure 1 gives the ar-
chitecture of our proposed approach.

proach

<bodyText confidence="0.9999614375">
Seen from the figure, our proposed approach
consists of four main steps: 1) The machine
translation quality score of each English sentence
is predicted by using regression methods; 2) The
informativeness score of each English sentence is
computed by using existing methods; 3) The
English summary is produced by making use of
both the machine translation quality score and
the informativeness score; 4) The extracted Eng-
lish summary is translated into Chinese summary
by using machine translation services.
In this study, we adopt Google Translate1 for
English-to-Chinese translation. Google Translate
is one of the state-of-the-art commercial machine
translation systems used today. It applies statisti-
cal learning techniques to build a translation

<bodyText confidence="0.999975763157895">
In this study, machine translation (MT) quality
reflects both the translation accuracy and the flu-
ency of the translated sentence. An English sen-
tence with high MT quality score is likely to be
translated into an accurate and fluent Chinese
sentence, which can be easily read and under-
stand by Chinese readers. The MT quality pre-
diction is a task of mapping an English sentence
to a numerical value corresponding to a quality
level. The larger the value is, the more accurately
and fluently the sentence can be translated into
Chinese sentence.
As introduced in Section 2.1, several related
work has used regression and classification
methods for MT quality prediction without refer-
ence translations. In our approach, the MT qual-
ity of each sentence in the documents is also pre-
dicted without reference translations. The differ-
ence between our task and previous work is that
previous work can make use of both features in
source sentence and features in target sentence,
while our task only leverages features in source
sentence, because in the late translation strategy,
the English sentences in the documents have not
been translated yet at this step.
In this study, we adopt the ε-support vector re-
gression (ε-SVR) method (Vapnik 1995) for the
sentence-level MT quality prediction task. The
SVR algorithm is firmly grounded in the frame-
work of statistical learning theory (VC theory).
The goal of a regression algorithm is to fit a flat
function to the given training data points.
Formally, given a set of training data points
D={(xi,yi) |i=1,2,...,n}eRd×R, where xi is input
feature vector and yi is associated score, the goal
is to fit a function f which approximates the rela-
tion inherited between the data set points. The
standard form is:

The constant C&gt;0 is a parameter for determin-
ing the trade-off between the flatness of f and the
amount up to which deviations larger than ε are
tolerated.
In the experiments, we use the LIBSVM tool
(Chang and Lin, 2001) with the RBF kernel for
the task, and we use the parameter selection tool
of 10-fold cross validation via grid search to find
the best parameters on the training set with re-
spect to mean squared error (MSE), and then use
the best parameters to train on the whole training
set.
We use the following two groups of features
for each sentence: the first group includes several
basic features, and the second group includes
several parse based features2. They are all de-
rived based on the source English sentence.
The basic features are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9815014375">
1) Sentence length: It refers to the number of
words in the sentence.
2) Sub-sentence number: It refers to the num-
ber of sub-sentences in the sentence. We
simply use the punctuation marks as indica-
tors of sub-sentences.
3) Average sub-sentence length: It refers to
the average number of words in the sub-
sentences within the sentence.
4) Percentage of nouns and adjectives: It re-
fers to the percentage of noun words or ad-
jective words in the in the sentence.
5) Number of question words: It refers to the
number of question words (who, whom,
whose, when, where, which, how, why, what)

We use the Stanford Lexicalized Parser (Klein
and Manning, 2002) with the provided English

In the experiments, we first constructed the gold-
standard dataset in the following way:
DUC2001 provided 309 English news articles
for document summarization tasks, and the arti-
cles were grouped into 30 document sets. The
news articles were selected from TREC-9. We
chose five document sets (d04, d05, d06, d08,
d11) with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001
document sets. The documents were then split
into sentences and we used 1736 sentences for
evaluation. All the sentences were automatically
translated into Chinese sentences by using the
Google Translate service.
Two Chinese college students were employed
for data annotation. They read the original Eng-
lish sentence and the translated Chinese sentence,
and then manually labeled the overall translation
quality score for each sentence, separately. The
translation quality is an overall measure for both
the translation accuracy and the readability of the
translated sentence. The score ranges between 1
and 5, and 1 means “very bad”, and 5 means
“very good”, and 3 means “normal”. The correla-
tion between the two sets of labeled scores is
0.646. The final translation quality score was the
average of the scores provided by the two anno-
tators.
After annotation, we randomly separated the
labeled sentence set into a training set of 1428
sentences and a test set of 308 sentences. We
then used the LIBSVM tool for training and test-
ing.
Two metrics were used for evaluating the pre-
diction results. The two metrics are as follows:
Mean Square Error (MSE): This metric is a
measure of how correct each of the prediction
values is on average, penalizing more severe er-
rors more heavily. Given the set of prediction
scores for the test sentences: Yˆ = {yˆi  |i =1, ...n} , and

Table 1 shows the prediction results. We can see
that the overall results are promising. And the
correlation is moderately high. The results are
acceptable because we only make use of the fea-
tures derived from the source sentence. The re-
sults guarantee that the use of MT quality scores
in the summarization process is feasible.
We can also see that both the basic features
and the parse features are beneficial to the over-
all prediction results.

In this section, we first compute the informative-
ness score for each sentence. The score reflect
how the sentence expresses the major topic in the
documents. Various existing methods can be
used for computing the score. In this study, we
adopt the centroid-based method.
The centroid-based method is the algorithm
used in the MEAD system. The method uses a
heuristic and simple way to sum the sentence
scores computed based on different features. The
score for each sentence is a linear combination of

the weights computed based on the following
three features:
Centroid-based Weight. The sentences close
to the centroid of the document set are usually
more important than the sentences farther away.
And the centroid weight C(si) of a sentence si is
calculated as the cosine similarity between the
sentence text and the concatenated text for the
whole document set D. The weight is then nor-
malized by dividing the maximal weight.
Sentence Position. The leading several sen-
tences of a document are usually important. So
we calculate for each sentence a weight to reflect
its position priority as P(si)=1-(i-1)/n, where i is
the sequence of the sentence si and n is the total
number of sentences in the document. Obviously,
i ranges from 1 to n.
First Sentence Similarity. Because the first
sentence of a document is very important, a sen-
tence similar to the first sentence is also impor-
tant. Thus we use the cosine similarity value be-
tween a sentence and the corresponding first sen-
tence in the same document as the weight F(si)
for sentence si.
After all the above weights are calculated for
each sentence, we sum all the weights and get the
overall score for the sentence as follows:
InfoScore (si) = α • Qsi) +,8 • P(si) + y • F(si )
where α, β and γ are parameters reflecting the
importance of different features. We empirically
set α=β=γ=1.
After the informativeness scores for all sen-
tences are computed, the score of each sentence
is normalized by dividing by the maximum score.
After we obtain the MT quality score and the
informativeness score of each sentence in the
document set, we linearly combine the two
scores to get the overall score of each sentence.
Formally, let TransScore(si)∈[0,1] and Info-
Score(si)∈[0,1] denote the MT quality score and
the informativeness score of sentence si, the
overall score of the sentence is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.985677">
OverallScore(s) = (1− A) x InfoScore(s) + A x TransSco
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999664263157895">
where λ∈[0,1] is a parameter controlling the
influences of the two factors. If λ is set to 0, the
summary is extracted without considering the
MT quality factor. In the experiments, we em-
pirically set the parameter to 0.3 in order to bal-
ance the two factors of content informativeness
and translation quality.
For multi-document summarization, some sen-
tences are highly overlapping with each other,
and thus we apply the same greedy algorithm in
(Wan et al., 2006) to penalize the sentences
highly overlapping with other highly scored sen-
tences, and finally the informative, novel, and
easy-to-translate sentences are chosen into the
English summary.
Finally, the sentences in the English summary
are translated into the corresponding Chinese
sentences by using Google Translate, and the
Chinese summary is formed.

neric reference English summaries were pro-
vided by NIST annotators for evaluation. In our
study, we aimed to produce Chinese summaries
for the English document sets. The summary
length was limited to five sentences, i.e. each
summary consisted of five sentences.
The DUC2001 dataset was divided into the
following two datasets:
Ideal Dataset: We have manually labeled the
MT quality scores for the sentences in five
document sets (d04-d11), and we directly used
the manually labeled scores in the summarization
process. The ideal dataset contained these five
document sets.
Real Dataset: The MT quality scores for the
sentences in the remaining 25 document sets
were automatically predicted by using the
learned SVM regression model. And we used the
automatically predicted scores in the summariza-
tion process. The real dataset contained these 25
document sets.
We performed two evaluation procedures: one
based on the ideal dataset to validate the
feasibility of the proposed approach, and
the other based on the real dataset to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in real applications.
To date, various methods and metrics have
been developed for English summary evaluation
by comparing system summary with reference
summary, such as the pyramid method (Nenkova
et al., 2007) and the ROUGE metrics (Lin and
Hovy, 2003). However, such methods or metrics
cannot be directly used for evaluating Chinese
summary without reference Chinese summary.

Instead, we developed an evaluation protocol as
follows:
The evaluation was based on human scoring.
Four Chinese college students participated in the
evaluation as subjects. We have developed a
friendly tool for helping the subjects to evaluate
each Chinese summary from the following three
aspects:
Content: This aspect indicates how much a
summary reflects the major content of the docu-
ment set. After reading a summary, each user can
select a score between 1 and 5 for the summary.
1 means “very uninformative” and 5 means
“very informative”.
Readability: This aspect indicates the read-
ability level of the whole summary. After reading
a summary, each user can select a score between
1 and 5 for the summary. 1 means “hard to read”,
and 5 means “easy to read”.
Overall: This aspect indicates the overall
quality of a summary. After reading a summary,
each user can select a score between 1 and 5 for
the summary. 1 means “very bad”, and 5 means
“very good”.
We performed the evaluation procedures on
the ideal dataset and the read dataset, separately.
During each evaluation procedure, we compared
our proposed approach (λ=0.3) with the baseline
approach without considering the MT quality
factor (λ=0). And the two summaries produced
by the two systems for the same document set
were presented in the same interface, and then
the four subjects assigned scores to each sum-
mary after they read and compared the two
summaries. And the assigned scores were finally
averaged across the documents sets and across
the subjects.

Table 2 shows the evaluation results on the ideal
dataset with 5 document sets. We can see that
based on the manually labeled MT quality scores,
the Chinese summaries produced by our pro-
posed approach are significantly better than that
produced by the baseline approach over all three
aspects. All subjects agree that our proposed ap-
proach can produce more informative and easy-
to-read Chinese summaries than the baseline ap-
proach.
Table 3 shows the evaluation results on the
real dataset with 25 document sets. We can see
that based on the automatically predicted MT
quality scores, the Chinese summaries produced
by our proposed approach are significantly better
than that produced by the baseline approach over
the readability aspect and the overall aspect. Al-
most all subjects agree that our proposed ap-
proach can produce more easy-to-read and high-
quality Chinese summaries than the baseline ap-
proach.
Comparing the evaluation results in the two
tables, we can find that the performance differ-
ence between the two approaches on the ideal
dataset is bigger than that on the real dataset, es-
pecially on the content aspect. The results dem-
onstrate that the more accurate the MT quality
scores are, the more significant the performance
improvement is.
Overall, the proposed approach is effective to
produce good-quality Chinese summaries for
English document sets.

In this study, we adopt the late translation strat-
egy for cross-document summarization. As men-
tioned earlier, the late translation strategy has
some advantages over the early translation strat-
egy. However, in the early translation strategy,
we can use the features derived from both the
source English sentence and the target Chinese
sentence to improve the MT quality prediction
results.
Overall, the framework of our proposed ap-
proach can be easily adapted for cross-document
summarization with the early translation strategy.

7 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996825">
In this study we propose a novel approach to ad-
dress the cross-language document summariza-
tion task. Our proposed approach predicts the
MT quality score of each English sentence and
then incorporates the score into the summariza-
tion process. The user study results verify the
effectiveness of the approach.
In future work, we will manually translate
English reference summaries into Chinese refer-
ence summaries, and then adopt the ROUGE
metrics to perform automatic evaluation of the
extracted Chinese summaries by comparing them
with the Chinese reference summaries. Moreover,
we will further improve the sentence’s MT qual-
ity by using sentence compression or sentence
reduction techniques.

<abstract confidence="0.995934708333333">Cross-language document summarization is a task of producing a summary in one language for a document set in a different language. Existing methods simply use machine translation for document translation or summary translation. However, current machine translation services are far from satisfactory, which results in that the quality of the cross-language summary is usually very poor, both in readability and content. In this paper, we propose to consider the translation quality of each sentence in the English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization process. First, the translation quality of each English sentence in the document set is predicted with the SVM regression method, and then the quality score of each sentence is incorporated into the summarization process. Finally, the English sentences with high translation quality and high informativeness are selected and translated to form the Chinese summary. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach.</abstract>

Usually, the human reference translation is provided, and various methods and metrics have been developed for comparing the system-translated text and the human reference text. For example, the BLEU metric, the NIST metric and their relatives are all based on the idea that the more shared substrings the system-translated text has with the human reference translation, the better the translation is. Blatz et al. (2003) investigate training sentence-level confidence measures using a variety of fuzzy match scores. Albrecht and Hwa (2007) rely on regression algorithms and reference-based features to measure the quality of sentences. Transition evaluation without using reference translations has also been investigated. Quirk (2004) presents a supervised method for training a sentence level confidence measure on translation output using a human-annotated corpus. Features derived from the source sentence and the target sentence (e.g. sentence length, perplexity, etc.) and features about the translation process are leveraged. Gamon et al.

Extractionbased summarization methods usually assign each sentence a saliency score and then rank the sentences in a document or document set. For single document summarization, the sentence score is usually computed by empirical combination of a number of statistical and linguistic feature values, such as term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (Luhn 1969; Lin and Hovy, 2000). The summary sentences can also be selected by using machine learning methods (Kupiec et al., 1995; Amini and Gallinari, 2002) or graph-based methods (ErKan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). Other methods include mutual reinforcement principle (Zha 2002; Wan et al., 2007). For multi-document summarization, the centroid-based method (Radev et al., 2004) is a typical method, and it scores sentences based on cluster centroids, position and TFIDF features. NeATS (Lin and Hovy, 2002) makes use of new features such as topic signature to select important sentences. Machine Learning based approaches have also been proposed for combining various sentence features (Wong et al., 2008). The influences of input difficul</context>

Usually, the human reference translation is provided, and various methods and metrics have been developed for comparing the system-translated text and the human reference text. For example, the BLEU metric, the NIST metric and their relatives are all based on the idea that the more shared substrings the system-translated text has with the human reference translation, the better the translation is. Blatz et al. (2003) investigate training sentence-level confidence measures using a variety of fuzzy match scores. Albrecht and Hwa (2007) rely on regression algorithms and reference-based features to measure the quality of sentences. Transition evaluation without using reference translations has also been investigated. Quirk (2004) presents a supervised method for training a sentence level confidence measure on translation output using a human-annotated corpus. Features derived from the source sentence and the target sentence (e.g. sentence length, perplexity, etc.) and features about the translation process ar</context>

Formally, given a set of training data points D={(xi,yi) |i=1,2,...,n}eRd×R, where xi is input feature vector and yi is associated score, the goal is to fit a function f which approximates the relation inherited between the data set points. The standard form is: n n T min* w w C + ∑ � + C∑ �* i i i=1 i= 1 Subject to wTf(x ) +b−y &lt;E+� i i i yi −wTf(xi) − b &lt;E +�i* &gt;_ 0, i =1, ... , n.

In the experiments, we use the LIBSVM tool (Chang and Lin, 2001) with the RBF kernel for the task, and we use the parameter selection tool of 10-fold cross validation via grid search to find the best parameters on the training set with respect to mean squared error (MSE), and then use the best parameters to train on the whole training set. We use the following two groups of features for each sentence: the first group includes several basic features, and the second group includes several parse based features2.

We performed two evaluation procedures: one based on the ideal dataset to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, and the other based on the real dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real applications. To date, various methods and metrics have been developed for English summary evaluation by comparing system summary with reference summary, such as the pyramid method (Nenkova et al., 2007) and the ROUGE metrics (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

In our approach, the MT quality of each sentence in the documents is also predicted without reference translations. The difference between our task and previous work is that previous work can make use of both features in source sentence and features in target sentence, while our task only leverages features in source sentence, because in the late translation strategy, the English sentences in the documents have not been translated yet at this step. In this study, we adopt the ε-support vector regression (ε-SVR) method (Vapnik 1995) for the sentence-level MT quality prediction task. The SVR algorithm is firmly grounded in the framework of statistical learning theory (VC theory). The goal of a regression algorithm is to fit a flat function to the given training data points. Formally, given a set of training data points D={(xi,yi) |i=1,2,...,n}eRd×R, where xi is input feature vector and yi is associated score, the goal is to fit a function f which approximates the relation inherited between the data set points. The standard form is: n n T min* w w C + ∑ � + C∑ �* i i i=1 i= 1 Subject to wTf(x ) +b−y &lt;E+� i i i yi −wTf(xi) </context>

If λ is set to 0, the summary is extracted without considering the MT quality factor. In the experiments, we empirically set the parameter to 0.3 in order to balance the two factors of content informativeness and translation quality. For multi-document summarization, some sentences are highly overlapping with each other, and thus we apply the same greedy algorithm in (Wan et al., 2006) to penalize the sentences highly overlapping with other highly scored sentences, and finally the informative, novel, and easy-to-translate sentences are chosen into the English summary. Finally, the sentences in the English summary are translated into the corresponding Chinese sentences by using Google Translate, and the Chinese summary is formed. 5.2 Evaluation 5.2.1 Evaluation Setup In this experiment, we used the document sets provided by DUC2001 for evaluation.
