The volume aims to inform the implementation of human language technologies (HLTs)
in the service of language policy in South Africa. Its 12 papers are organized into five
sections whose themes, except for the first, “HLT resources and policy development,”
considerably overlap. The contributors, most with backgrounds in computer science,
computational linguistics, and language engineering, are international, with several
from The Netherlands, Belgium, and South Africa.

1. Overview of the Book
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975285922077922">
The introduction (Daelemans, du Plessis, Snyman, and Teck) argues that HLTs are
needed to provide equity of access to information under South Africa’s eleven-language
policy. They see HLTs as a means of enabling “all South Africans to use and share
information in the language of their choice.”
Chapter 1 then draws on Dutch and Flemish research and experience, in particular
the Dutch BLARK (Basic Language Resources Kit) pursued as part of a Dutch Language
Union project. An array of charts lists the various components that such a kit might
consist of (classified as applications, modules, or data), together with the relationships,
priorities, and availabilities amongst them, based upon the work of a research commit-
tee and survey responses from academics and commercial developers. The result is a
clear picture of the state of HLT for Dutch — found to be incomplete and of variable
quality — and short priority lists and criteria for future development.
One of the more important chapters is the second (Roux and du Plessis), which
completes the policy section. It describes the South African government’s efforts to
foster the development of language and speech technologies and resources, recently
expressed as the “Human Language Technologies initiative” of 2004, exactly ten years
since the eleven-language policy was established. The authors survey reports and devel-
opments over the decade, finding repeated themes such as an emphasis on government
co-ordination and industry partnerships, promotion of multilingualism, and support
of “historically marginalized languages” (page 29). The authors describe the general
trend of government policy as treating HLT as primarily “a language affair,” that is,
as “an instrument of language development and language promotion”; they identify
a tension between such aims and “more general expectations” of HLT as a means
of enhancing access to information. Generally critical of the present government in

its pursuit of “political” aims, the authors prefer to see HLT as an integral part of
an “information society” that strives for universal access and consequent social and
economic advantages. This polarity, and the wide gap it exposes between positions,
represents a weakness of the book as a whole: the absence of language communities as
living entities, and the lack of research (and evidence) about their linguistic situations
and needs.
Chapters 3 to 6 cover automatic translation. Chapter 3 (Weber) describes a con-
tinuum of MT (machine translation) technologies, ranging from fully automated to
those involving considerable human intervention at various stages. This is an important
distinction, not only for the technologies themselves (for example, machine learning can
crucially involve human supervision), but also for matching technologies to needs and
the resources available, although there is little in the book about the latter. The chapter
is a good summary of MT terms and concepts, and phases in its development; most
interesting for language planners and policy-makers will be to learn that decades of MT
research have been largely unsuccessful, with its first paradigm — rule-based trans-
lation — largely abandoned as fruitless, and newer statistical methods yet unproven
(several later chapters corroborate this conclusion). We find here the first grounds
for doubt about the book’s ability to fulfill its aims: while the author provides three
examples of translations, not only are they (as he explains) moderately unsuccessful,
but they involve translation between major European languages; the language planner
will wonder therefore what prospects there are for African languages, and may question
why more relevant examples could not have been found. While the chapter offers a
good, non-technical background to automated translation, hinting at the difficulties of
translating meaning and context, unfortunately, as in most chapters, technology rarely
gets considered in the context of its users. This may lead to problems; for example,
tolerating “less-than-perfect results” may assist implementation but may be precarious
in communities who do not have much experience with information technology (IT)
or, perhaps as a result of that, expect perfection from it. The strategy of constraining
translation to particular domains may not be relevant to community concerns or modes
of information-seeking; here the weather-forecast domain is mentioned, in chapter 10
we find IT job-postings to a Usenet newsgroup.
Chapter 4 (Champollion) moves from technologies to specific tools and functions,
and is another chapter that planners and policy makers should find useful. While (non-
automated) translation is of interest to researchers, it remains the ugly duckling of HLT
in terms of deliverables (useful tools). Paradoxically, it is widely approached with skep-
ticism while being one of the few areas where HLT has brought productivity benefits
and “become part of a language practitioner’s daily life” (page 61). The chapter nicely
describes several relatively humble but effective tools, such as a segmenter (assists
mechanical tasks of aligning source and target sentences), translation memory (an in-
teractive database of translation segments already made), and terminology banks. Such
tools allow the human translator to focus on the language task and to leverage existing
work. The reviewer is reminded of a dyslexic friend who many years ago found that
even the most basic speech synthesis was a boon — he could hear and check the e-mail
he was typing, opening up new possibilities for communication. Voice recognition has
considerably improved, according to the author, but is strongly language-dependent;
perhaps its adoption will depend on whether keypress or voice input technologies catch
the imagination of a new generation.
Messerschmidt et al. (chapter 5) provide a digestible account of the mechanisms
of a rule-based parser and grammar that learn under human supervision, showing
its application to Sesotho. This will be useful for non-specialists. Nevertheless, their

argument that HLTs are needed for African languages is based on a belief that HLTs
for colonial languages (English and Afrikaans) would be sufficient if only Africans had
a better command of them. While colonial languages, especially English, continue to
play significant, even increasing, roles, especially in business and service delivery in
South Africa, what is missing here is the larger picture: evidence about language and
technology preferences within particular activities and domains, and acknowledgment
that the context for technology development should at least include “capacity building,”
including, for example, increasing IT training and employment for speakers of African
languages. Short-term projects channeling the richer information currently available in
English (e.g., about AIDS) into languages such as Sesotho may not provide a means of
addressing future health threats.
Given that current MT methods have matured but remain ineffective, Champol-
lion’s second contribution (chapter 6) considers future possibilities for MT. Starting from
a transcendental discussion on complexity (and the number pi), he moves between
abstract discussion and concrete advice on corpus creation: Don’t attempt to replace
“relevance with bulk, or quality with quantity” (page 83) — it is futile to build larger
and larger translation databases in the expectation of enabling successful translation.
He sees today’s methods as merely “pumps” that work on elements of “how humans
think languages are organized” (page 83), and foresees a day when computers produce
detailed fractal grammars in their own pattern-matching terms.
The third section is more optimistic, with two chapters based on the use of parallel
corpora. Marcu shows that statistical machine translation software using such corpora
is not only at least as effective as rule-based methods but is cheaper to develop and,
more importantly, adaptable to a variety of languages. However, while the software
is generic, preparing parallel corpora, especially for pairs of “low density” languages
(page 95), is difficult (if not impossible), or may involve reducing content to the trivial or
to domains that are usually dealt with in another language anyway. African languages
appear for the first time as the main focus in chapter 8 (Prinsloo and De Schryver).
Parallel corpora can contribute to research in phonetics, linguistics, language change,
and lexicography, as well as in practical applications such as language teaching and
spelling checkers. The authors used widely available corpus software (WordSmith
and ParaConc) to build collections of translation equivalents and extract document
keywords, with careful evaluation of the results; however, the techniques have not
yet been extended to the production of useful tools such as dictionaries and spelling
checkers.
Localization — the fourth theme — could have received more attention than a
single chapter (van Rooy) classifying and evaluating student spelling errors in or-
der to show that “linguistic resources should be localized for South African Eng-
lish.” Some useful concepts, such as precision and recall, are explained, and a
comprehensive typology of errors is presented. The author reaches the unstartling
conclusion that a spelling checker would be improved if it was provided with a list
of place-names, acronyms, and frequently occurring errors. A reader (especially a
planner or policy-maker) surely wants to know about spelling in African languages,
about localized change that English is undergoing as it is adapted across different
African communities (rather than the increasingly outdated concept of standard South
African English), and about localization issues for African software and operating
systems.
The theme of text mining also receives a single chapter (Mooney and Nahm),
which examines the discovery of relationships and patterns in both structured and
unstructured documents. The authors developed a system that learns to perform

information extraction (e.g., summarization, template-filling), and then use further
data-mining of the structured results to improve its information extraction accuracy. The
domain chosen for presentation of results — IT job-postings to a Usenet newsgroup in
English — is surely over-constrained and barely relevant to the purposes of the book.
“Multilingual text and speech interfaces” is the sixth and final section. Chapter 11
(Roux and Louw) revealingly presents a project to develop multilingual speech data-
bases. Over 5,000 telephone calls from recruited participants were recorded and then
transcribed phonetically and orthographically (with time alignment). Here we find
not only consideration of sound for the first time, but also research linked to relevant
sociolinguistic factors such as domains of usage (the importance of English in business)
and variation (e.g., regional and community-based varieties of English; L1 vs. L2 speak-
ers). Various stages in database design, speaker recruitment, automated prompting and
recording, data management, transcription, choice of standards, and error correction are
described. The chapter is replete with surprises that could have perhaps been factored
into the methodology rather than discovered, but remain interesting nonetheless —
such as that many people don’t wear watches (so that responses about time were
often not as expected), or that few speakers of African languages had the appropriate
telephone equipment to take part in the experiments.
The final chapter (Bosch) warns again that languages without adequate HLT “run
the risk of being marginalized in the global Information Society” (page 169). However,
the author’s main task is to summarize a system under development for the morpho-
logical analysis of Zulu, which presents many morphological and morphophonological
complexities not found in English.

2. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940869565217">
Despite the second chapter’s wariness about treating HLTs as political “language af-
fairs,” several chapters do jump off from problems of disadvantage direct to HLT
solutions without providing any evidence that the solutions fit the problem. Is it the
planners’ job to connect these? Certainly it is to some extent; however, in general
the book leaves the space between problems and solutions rather too wide, and the
planners’ task no less than before.
Planners need to be skeptical about claims that languages without “adequate
computer processing” (page 1) will simply disappear. Such dramaticizations, if true,
would condemn almost all of the world’s 6,000 languages to extinction. We know, from
research in language endangerment, that factors causing language death are complex,
widespread, and dangerous, and that they dwarf any contributions that HLT can (or
cannot) provide.
Several chapters have provided evidence of HLT’s limited capabilities, either di-
rectly or by indicating that the effectiveness and benefits of HLT fall in domains and
functions that are not likely to be at the forefront of language planners’ minds.
Will a planner or policy-maker be able to make use of this volume’s spectrum
of information from practical advice on data collection to the theoretical capabilities
and limits of statistical and fractal grammars? Examples scattered throughout the book
indicate possible directions: for example, IT training and the involvement of speakers of
African languages in projects would assist not only in providing richer sociolinguistic
input but also in the advancement of the technologies themselves (e.g., for supervised-
learning grammars); or that the limited prospect for HLT support of multilingualism
suggests prioritization of resources for multilingual education of the population.

While some HLTs can spark imagination and raise awareness of linguistic issues,
across the globe it is only in limited contexts that they have actually become vehicles for
communication, delivering services, or language learning and transmission. It may be
true that HLTs are more apt for servicing “language affairs” than they are for delivering
a multilingual information utopia.
