PREFACE
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.998292708333333">
This volume contains the papers prepared for the 31st Annual Meeting of the Association for Compu-
tational Linguistics, held 22-26 June 1993 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The cluster
of papers in the final section stems from the student session, featured at the meeting for the 3rd successive
year and testifying to the vigor of this emerging tradition.
The number and quality of submitted papers was again gratifying, and all authors deserve our collec-
tive plaudits for the efforts they invested despite the well-known risks of submitting to a highly selective
conference. It was their efforts that once again ensured a Meeting (and Proceedings) reflecting the
highest standards in computational linguistics, offering a tour of some of the most significant recent ad-
vances and most lively research frontiers.
Special thanks go to our invited speakers, Wolfgang Wahlster, Geoff Nunberg and Barbara Partee, for
contributing their insights and panache to the conference; to Philip Cohen for concocting and coordinat-
ing a varied and relevant tutorial program, and to Helen Gigley, Steve Small, Alexis Manaster Ramer,
Wlodek Zadrozny, Kent Wittenburg, David D. Lewis, and Elizabeth D. Liddy for offering the tutorials;
to Linda Suri and Sandra Carberry for very effectively co-organizing the program for the student sessions
(see the separate preface for the student session papers); to Terry Patten for directing local arrangements,
and to Robert Kasper for helping with local arrangements and coordinating exhibits and demonstrations.
In an effort to increase the fairness of reviewing, we opted for &amp;quot;blind&amp;quot; reviewing this year. Also, to
reduce the load upon program committee members to a more humanly manageable level, to curtail frantic
last-minute searches for specialist reviewers, and to allow more methodical, uniform, interactive review-
ing of submissions, the size of the program committee was expanded this year to include 22 members be-
sides the chair. The load was still heavy, but the committee members performed their duties in an exem-
plary fashion; in the five-week reviewing period which culminated in the one-day program committee
meeting, they spared no efforts to arrive at detailed, accurate and principled assessments, and at the best
possible program for the Meeting. Their heroic service is hereby acknowledged:

At this point it is also appropriate for me to convey my appreciation and gratitude to Peggy Meeker,
who handled the flood of regular and email correspondence, the massive record-keeping and accounting,
and the arrangement of meetings in connection with the activities of the program committee. She helped
expertly and unstintingly, despite all her other duties, and usually had things done by the time I thought of
doing them. Many thanks also to the Computer Science Department at Rochester for accommodating the
extra load created by the reviewing and program planning process.
Throughout the entire planning for the meeting, starting well before the formation of the program
committee, the ACL executive provided continuous and invaluable help in the committee search and on
many matters of policy and logistics. If the meeting was a success, it was very much through their gui-
dance. One of the mainstays of that committee is, of course, Don Walker. I now know that the effusive
tributes I had noticed in previous Proceedings to Don&apos;s manifold and essential role are more than
deserved. He is indeed the cohesive force, the publicist, the keeper and provider of records, traditions and
standards for ACL, and most of all an ever-ready, ever-effective helper and advisor. My heartfelt thanks
to him as well as to Betty Walker who as ever put her shoulder to the wheel alongside his.

Human language performance results from complex computations within a unique machine architecture. While neither this
brain hardware nor the specific computations for producing and comprehending language are well understood, certain facts are
available and a number of well supported hypotheses are under investigation. It is our view that the study of language perfor-
mance has a potentially large role to play in computational linguistics, and that the study of brain mechanisms underlying this
performance may yield insights into issues of importance for construction of artificial systems that process natural language.
This tutorial is organized into two sections. The first part describes the functional neuroanatomy of the brain, with greatest
emphasis on methods of testing language function in the brain, the sorts of results that have been obtained, and what these imply
for the structure of brain computations and for the nature of human language. Demonstrations of people with language impair-
ments (live or on videotape) as well as example computed tomographic and/or magnetic resonance images will supplement
descriptive material.
The second part of the tutorial will discuss two broad computational subjects, cognitive modelling and practical natural
language processing. A number of researchers are constructing computer models of cognitive neuropsychological phenomena,
many involving language, using both symbolic and connectionist methods. Several examples of such models and the neurobio-
logical and psychological data that constrain their processing architectures will be discussed. While certain aspects of linguistic
data and theory have been successfully applied to the construction of practical NLP systems, theoretical notions from neurobiolo-
gy have not played much role. This topic will be discussed with practical suggestions on using data and theory from cognitive
neuroscience to construct new NLP systems or to improve existing ones.

This tutorial will survey the uses of formal language, automata, and complexity theory in computational linguistics, seeking
to answer such questions as whether natural languages are, for example, context-free or parsable in deterministic polynomial
time. More generally, we will consider the question of how these formal theories can best be applied to NLs in a computational
setting, focusing on such issues as the properties of constructions vs. those of languages, the formalization and computational
uses Chomsky&apos;s intuitions about &amp;quot;E-&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;I-language&amp;quot;, the relative power of different models of NL, the formal treatment of
computational models of &amp;quot;performance&amp;quot;, and, finally, some startling new results about the power of models of semantics.

Multimedia and Multimodal Parsing
Kent Wittenburg, Bellcore
As new information channels and input devices arrive on the scene, the spectrum of possibilities and challenges for in-
terpretation increases beyond single-channel text or speech. First, there is integration of more than one modality -- speech and
simultaneous pointing being a paramount example. Second, characterizing and processing expressions in nonlinear input media
requires extensions to the usual linear, string-based methods. Examples of nonlinear input include static figures and diagrams; in-
teractive gesturing, writing, and drawing; live cameras and stored video; and data from eye-tracking hardware and 3D devices
such as spaceballs or datagloves.
This tutorial is directed towards ACL members who would like to be be made aware of current research in parsing and in-
terpretation of such media. The focus will be on identifying problems for which extensions to grammatical representation and
parsing methods already in common practice in computational linguistics may provide solutions. We will consider the problem
of characterizing multidimensional expressions separately and concurrently as languages and then survey techniques for parsing
and interpreting them. The tutorial will initially include a brief characterization of current research and practice in interpreting
nonlinear and multimodal input along these lines. Then it will highlight some of the more interesting grammatical frameworks,
with a brief overview of graph grammars as well as an introduction to current research from the visual languages community.
We will close with a detailed example using Relational Grammars, a framework for multidimensional languages that cuts across
several of the current proposals for constraint-based grammars and parsing methods.
Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval
David D. Lewis, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories
Elizabeth D. Liddy, Syracuse University
This tutorial will discuss the application of natural language processing methods to support more effective text retrieval and
text categorization. We will present a comprehensive discussion of the use of NLP methods to address particular characteristics
of human language that make these tasks difficult. In parallel, we will also consider more traditional &amp;quot;non-NLP&amp;quot; methods for
addressing the same problems, and discuss the tradeoffs for each. One theme of the tutorial is that the line between NLP and
non-NLP methods in IR is becoming quite fuzzy, with the increasing use of statistical and other robust techniques in NLP.
Linguistic examples will be drawn primarily from English, plus some from Japanese and other languages.

PREFACE TO THE STUDENT SESSION PAPERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859076923077">
These proceedings include the papers presented at the Student Sessions of the 31st Annual Meeting
of the Association for Computational Linguistics. The goal of the Student Sessions is to provide a forum
for student members to present work in progress, rather than completed work, and receive feedback from
other members of the computational linguistics community, particularly from senior researchers. The
response to the ACL students sessions held in 1991 and 1992 was very positive. The student authors re-
ported that they found the Student Sessions valuable, and the response at the conferences suggested that
the audiences found the sessions interesting and of high quality.
This year, there were thirty submissions to the ACL Student Sessions. While this represents a de-
crease in submissions from last year, we believe it reflects a fluctuation in the number of graduate stu-
dents currently at the appropriate stage of graduate study for submitting to the Student Sessions. We
thank all the authors for their papers.
We also thank the members of the ACL 1993 Student Sessions Planning Committee who helped
plan and organize the Student Sessions: Tilman Becker, University of Saarbriicken; Beth Ann Hockey,

<abstract confidence="0.993928636363636">of papers in the final section stems from the student session, featured at the meeting for the 3rd successive year and testifying to the vigor of this emerging tradition. The number and quality of submitted papers was again gratifying, and all authors deserve our collective plaudits for the efforts they invested despite the well-known risks of submitting to a highly selective conference. It was their efforts that once again ensured a Meeting (and Proceedings) reflecting the highest standards in computational linguistics, offering a tour of some of the most significant recent advances and most lively research frontiers. Special thanks go to our invited speakers, Wolfgang Wahlster, Geoff Nunberg and Barbara Partee, for contributing their insights and panache to the conference; to Philip Cohen for concocting and coordinating a varied and relevant tutorial program, and to Helen Gigley, Steve Small, Alexis Manaster Ramer, Wlodek Zadrozny, Kent Wittenburg, David D. Lewis, and Elizabeth D. Liddy for offering the tutorials; to Linda Suri and Sandra Carberry for very effectively co-organizing the program for the student sessions (see the separate preface for the student session papers); to Terry Patten for directing local arrangements, and to Robert Kasper for helping with local arrangements and coordinating exhibits and demonstrations. In an effort to increase the fairness of reviewing, we opted for &amp;quot;blind&amp;quot; reviewing this year. Also, to reduce the load upon program committee members to a more humanly manageable level, to curtail frantic last-minute searches for specialist reviewers, and to allow more methodical, uniform, interactive reviewing of submissions, the size of the program committee was expanded this year to include 22 members besides the chair. The load was still heavy, but the committee members performed their duties in an exemplary fashion; in the five-week reviewing period which culminated in the one-day program committee meeting, they spared no efforts to arrive at detailed, accurate and principled assessments, and at the best possible program for the Meeting. Their heroic service is hereby acknowledged:</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.961956357142857">At this point it is also appropriate for me to convey my appreciation and gratitude to Peggy Meeker, who handled the flood of regular and email correspondence, the massive record-keeping and accounting, and the arrangement of meetings in connection with the activities of the program committee. She helped expertly and unstintingly, despite all her other duties, and usually had things done by the time I thought of doing them. Many thanks also to the Computer Science Department at Rochester for accommodating the extra load created by the reviewing and program planning process. Throughout the entire planning for the meeting, starting well before the formation of the program committee, the ACL executive provided continuous and invaluable help in the committee search and on many matters of policy and logistics. If the meeting was a success, it was very much through their guidance. One of the mainstays of that committee is, of course, Don Walker. I now know that the effusive tributes I had noticed in previous Proceedings to Don&apos;s manifold and essential role are more than deserved. He is indeed the cohesive force, the publicist, the keeper and provider of records, traditions and standards for ACL, and most of all an ever-ready, ever-effective helper and advisor. My heartfelt thanks to him as well as to Betty Walker who as ever put her shoulder to the wheel alongside his.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.998267764705882">Human language performance results from complex computations within a unique machine architecture. While neither this brain hardware nor the specific computations for producing and comprehending language are well understood, certain facts are available and a number of well supported hypotheses are under investigation. It is our view that the study of language performance has a potentially large role to play in computational linguistics, and that the study of brain mechanisms underlying this performance may yield insights into issues of importance for construction of artificial systems that process natural language. This tutorial is organized into two sections. The first part describes the functional neuroanatomy of the brain, with greatest emphasis on methods of testing language function in the brain, the sorts of results that have been obtained, and what these imply for the structure of brain computations and for the nature of human language. Demonstrations of people with language impairments (live or on videotape) as well as example computed tomographic and/or magnetic resonance images will supplement descriptive material. The second part of the tutorial will discuss two broad computational subjects, cognitive modelling and practical natural language processing. A number of researchers are constructing computer models of cognitive neuropsychological phenomena, many involving language, using both symbolic and connectionist methods. Several examples of such models and the neurobiological and psychological data that constrain their processing architectures will be discussed. While certain aspects of linguistic data and theory have been successfully applied to the construction of practical NLP systems, theoretical notions from neurobiology have not played much role. This topic will be discussed with practical suggestions on using data and theory from cognitive to construct new or to improve existing ones.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.9699197">This tutorial will survey the uses of formal language, automata, and complexity theory in computational linguistics, seeking to answer such questions as whether natural languages are, for example, context-free or parsable in deterministic polynomial time. More generally, we will consider the question of how these formal theories can best be applied to NLs in a computational setting, focusing on such issues as the properties of constructions vs. those of languages, the formalization and computational uses Chomsky&apos;s intuitions about &amp;quot;E-&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;I-language&amp;quot;, the relative power of different models of NL, the formal treatment of computational models of &amp;quot;performance&amp;quot;, and, finally, some startling new results about the power of models of semantics. Multimedia and Multimodal Parsing Wittenburg, As new information channels and input devices arrive on the scene, the spectrum of possibilities and challenges for interpretation increases beyond single-channel text or speech. First, there is integration of more than one modality -speech and simultaneous pointing being a paramount example. Second, characterizing and processing expressions in nonlinear input media requires extensions to the usual linear, string-based methods. Examples of nonlinear input include static figures and diagrams; interactive gesturing, writing, and drawing; live cameras and stored video; and data from eye-tracking hardware and 3D devices such as spaceballs or datagloves. This tutorial is directed towards ACL members who would like to be be made aware of current research in parsing and interpretation of such media. The focus will be on identifying problems for which extensions to grammatical representation and parsing methods already in common practice in computational linguistics may provide solutions. We will consider the problem of characterizing multidimensional expressions separately and concurrently as languages and then survey techniques for parsing and interpreting them. The tutorial will initially include a brief characterization of current research and practice in interpreting nonlinear and multimodal input along these lines. Then it will highlight some of the more interesting grammatical frameworks,</abstract>
