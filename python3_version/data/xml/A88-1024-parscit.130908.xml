PRESENT

<bodyText confidence="0.9996617">
The 1980&apos;s have seen the arrival of commer-
cially successful natural language interfaces. Ar-
tificial Intelligence Corporation&apos;s Intellect&apos; was
introduced in the 1970&apos;s, but expanded in this
decade to support interaction with a wide
variety of systems. Each year, AIC hosts a user
group conference that draws hundreds of people.
The middle of the decade saw the arrival of
Symantec&apos;s Q&amp;A whose natural language inter-
face has helped it win honors as one of the PC
programs that is easiest to use. Q&amp;A now
speaks many languages besides English.
Worldwide sales have exceeded 100,000 copies.
Just as highly rated and as popular is Lotus
HAL whose English interface makes Lotus 1-2-3
more accessible. Last Fall, Lotus widely adver-
tised a bundled package of 1-2-3 and HAL.
The two newest products, BBN Laboratories&apos;
Parlance and Natural Language&apos;s DataTalker,
show the most extensive and detailed control of
English yet achieved. Both have gathered sig-
nificant financial support and are positioned for
major impact on the marketplace.
This achievement has not been easily ob-
tained. Other products have not achieved these
levels of acceptance or technical quality. Many
development efforts have failed to produce
products. The field has so far failed to develop
the immense market predicted for it early on in
the popular press.

FUTURE

<bodyText confidence="0.999776725">
Without assuming any major scientific
breakthroughs we can safely extrapolate from
the roots of today&apos;s successes into the future.
First, we know that natural language under-
standing is a hard problem. So we know that
the natural language products that succeed will
not appear overnight, but will be the result of
careful development. They also need more
elaborate grammars and semantic systems.
Even so we know that they will not cover any-

their respective holders.
thing but a fraction of English. Clearly a
habitable fraction can be achieved, but successful
products will find ways to achieve partial under-
standing and graceful error recovery.
Since interfaces need to be tailored to achieve
the greatest success in each new application,
products will be rewarded for good knowledge
acquisition tools. To date, these have mostly
been tools to build lexicons, but they will have
to go further and give the customer more access
to the grammar, semantics, and pragmatics.
Few users care whether a computer speaks
their natural language. Their goal is to interact
with the computer in a natural way. So
products will be rewarded that integrate natural
language into other means of interacting: point-
ing, drawing, menus, etc.
Of course, products will be rewarded for ach-
ieving all the traditional data processing
qualities: efficient processing, good documen-
tation, trustworthy support, upward com-
patibility between releases, etc.
Finally, we can point to speech understand-
ing as the one field where breakthroughs will
make a major difference in the natural language
interface market. If users can be freed from the
demands of the keyboards, they will rush to
natural language interfaces.

These opinions on our technology are those
of the moderator. Today&apos;s panel is composed of
the leading innovators in commercial natural
language interfaces. They will try to identify
where their systems succeed, where they are less
than successful, and where the field is likely to
head. Feel free to contact them to learn more
