Walker (1996) presents a cache model of the operation of attention in the processing of discourse
as an alternative to the focus space stack that was proposed previously by Grosz and Sidner
(Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986). In this squib, we present a critical analysis of the cache
model and of Walker&apos;s supporting evidence from anaphora in discourses with interruptions and
from informationally redundant utterances. We argue that the cache model is underdetermined
in several ways that are crucial to a comparison of the two models and conclude that Walker has
not established the superiority of the cache model. We also argue that psycholinguistic evidence
does not support the cache model over the focus stack model.

<bodyText confidence="0.99988575">
Attention constrains the structure and processing of discourse. This fact has been
important to computational research on discourse since the work of Grosz (1977b).
A recent article by Walker (1996) argues that the attentional mechanism has limited
capacity, that this limited capacity determines the accessibility of information in dis-
course processing, and that certain linguistic behavior can only be explained in terms
of this limited capacity. Walker presents as an alternative to the focus space stack
previously proposed to model global attentional state (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner
1986) a cache model in which linear recency and a highly constrained cache capacity
play primary roles. As critical evidence, Walker presents an analysis of anaphora in
discourses with interruptions and of informationally redundant utterances (IRUs). In
addition, she cites psychological evidence on the limited capacity of human informa-
tion processing. In this response, we discuss the relationship between the focus-space
stack model and the cache model, examine Walker&apos;s evidence with respect to the two
models, and review psychological evidence concerning the contributions of limited
capacity and recency to the understanding of discourse. We identify problems with
Walker&apos;s analysis and deficiencies in the cache model.

Walker argues that &amp;quot;[t]he notion of a cache in combination with main memory, as is
standard in computational architectures, is a good basis for a computational model of hu-
man attentional capacity in discourse processing (emphasis added)&amp;quot; (page 258). Walker

Within computer systems, the stack and cache address different concerns and
levels of processing. The stack model draws on ideas in programming languages
that work on evaluation of variables. The cache model is based on work on mem-
ory management. To examine Walker&apos;s claims, we first identify those features of each
computational construct that play a role in the respective discourse models.
The use of a focus space stack as a model of global attentional state for discourse
processing (Grosz 197Th) drew on the use of stacks by programming language inter-
preters and compilers to determine variable values. In interpreters and compilers, the
stack determines the value a variable has when a processor is in a certain state. It
provides implicit indexing and an ordering of access to values that is dependent on
context. These two properties and the stack&apos;s ability to capture hierarchical relation-
ships are the primary attributes adopted in the stack-based model of global discourse
structure and processing.
Because Walker describes the cache model only generally and does not identify
specific properties of caches that are relevant to her model, we first establish the basic
roles of caches in computer systems and then identify those properties that seem most
relevant to her claims. In computer systems architectures, the cache and main memory
are elements of the memory hierarchy, each level of which has a different speed, size,
and cost. Faster memory is &amp;quot;closer&amp;quot; to the processor allowing for quicker processing
of information stored there. The term &amp;quot;cache&amp;quot; primarily refers to the smallest, fastest
memory that is accessed first. Because the whole point of the cache is to speed up
processing, cache management algorithms must be low cost. They are syntactic in the
extreme, depending on physical properties of the system and making no reference to
content. For discourse-processing algorithms, and for Walker&apos;s model, similar phys-
ical properties of human memory do not seem the issue and content (semantic and
pragmatic) does matter.
Only two of the central memory-hierarchy questions for computer architectures
(Patterson and Hennessy 1996) are relevant to the discourse issues Walker raises: re-
placement strategy and how information is found in the cache. Walker does not spec-
ify a replacement strategy, but suggests consideration of a modification of the &amp;quot;least
recently used&amp;quot; strategy that accommodates what she calls &amp;quot;preferential retention.&amp;quot;
Preferential retention is not clearly defined in the squib; we are given no details on
how items to be (preferentially) retained are identified nor on differences in treatment
of retained items and those in the cache on some other basis. Preferential retention
is said to depend on the intentions of the discourse participants, but exactly how is
not specified. There is no discussion of how to identify the information relevant to a
new intention that should be retained. Because intention-based preferential retention
seems to be the main way Walker&apos;s cache model breaks out of a strict linear-recency
approach, the lack of detail makes it difficult to ascertain exactly how it works, and
more generally to establish how the model differs from the stack model.
Walker does not discuss methods for searching the cache although issues of locat-
ing information in the cache are important in computer systems design. Instead, the
cache model assumes the cache is sufficiently limited in size that everything in it is
&amp;quot;almost instantaneously accessible&amp;quot; (Walker 1996, 258). Walker also does not define
&amp;quot;strategically retrieve&amp;quot; nor specify how main memory is searched when items are not
found in the cache. Because main memory is part of the cache model (see the quotation
that starts this section), without such information it is difficult to evaluate the model.
Hence, the main claims of the cache model seem to be that (1) the cache contains
a small number of items; (2) as new entities are discussed in the discourse, entities not
mentioned recently are removed from the cache to make room, and (3) remention and
some (unspecified) connection with the current discourse intention cause an entity to

be retained longer in the cache than it would otherwise be. An important related claim
is that (4) only items in the cache are available for various discourse processes like the
inference of discourse relations (Walker 1996, 258).
Linear recency thus plays a much more substantial role in the cache model than
in the stack model. In this context, claim (1) raises both computational and linguistic
issues. From a computational point of view, the cache must be small enough to al-
low for instant retrieval of all items (or Walker must specify the retrieval part of the
processing); from the linguistic point of view, the cache size must accommodate the
facts of informationally redundant utterances—being small enough to explain when
an IRU is required and large enough to explain when no IRU is needed.
The stack model makes specific claims about how intentions at the discourse level
affect attentional state, providing the basis for the hierarchical structure. With respect
to (3), Walker says that such intentions influence retention and retrieval in the cache
model, but no details are given. Intentional connections might be identified and func-
tion identically to the intentional structure in the stack model (which would certainly
greatly lessen the differences between the two models) or differently (in which case
comparison would shed light on the appropriateness of the different models). An ad-
ditional difference between the models is the cache model claim (4). The stack model
claims only differences in speed and complexity of accessibility, not possibility of ac-
cessibility, among those items in the stack and those not.

3. Linguistic Evidence
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98825037037037">
In her squib, Walker discusses two types of linguistic evidence: pronominal reference
following interruptions and informationally redundant utterances. We first examine
this evidence from the stack model perspective showing how the data might be ac-
counted for within that model; we then raise some questions about Walker&apos;s cache
model explanations.
In earlier work (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986) we have argued that it
is important to distinguish between two levels of discourse structure and processing:
global and local. A focus-space stack was proposed as a model for the global level. The
main claims about its use in processing have been for handling definite descriptions
(Grosz 1977a; Grosz 1981) and reasoning about intentional structure (Lochbaum 1998).
The local level &amp;quot;refers to the influence of a listener&apos;s memory for the linguistic form
of an utterance (the actual words and the syntactic structure) on his interpretation of
a subsequent utterance&amp;quot; (Grosz 1977b).1
According to this theory of discourse structure, pronominal reference depends on
the local level of attentional state, not the global level. Initial work on hierarchical
discourse structure was motivated by examples of pronouns that were used to re-
fer to entities in stacked focus spaces. This work could be read as suggesting that
some memory for local attentional state was attached to each focus space. However,
such an account would contradict the local nature of local attentional state, and we
have more recently denied it (Grosz and Sidner 1997). A more satisfactory explana-
tion of such pronoun uses has two components: specification of the information that
indicates a shift in focus back to the attentional state of some previous discourse seg-
ment (typically more than an unstressed pronoun alone) and a determination of the
1 Sidner (1979) first provided algorithms that tied the local level with pronominal reference. In
subsequent work we have defined a centering model for attentional state at this level (Grosz, Joshi, and
Weinstein 1995) and have explored the ways in which pronominal reference and centering
interact (Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993, interalia).

possible connections between discourse segment purposes and the entities for which
such pronoun uses are felicitous (which, we conjecture, should be close connections).
Although such pronoun uses provide compelling evidence of the hierarchical nature
of discourse structure, the focus space stack in itself is not sufficient to explain their
interpretation.
The claim of centering theory is not that centering alone suffices for resolving all
pronominal reference (see Kehler [1997]), but that when attentional state plays a role,
it is local, not global attentional state. This distinction is important as we reexamine
Walker&apos;s data and claims.
The stack model requires that a speaker indicate to a hearer when attention is
shifting from one discourse intention, and thus segment, to another. As a result of
such shifts, focus spaces may be &amp;quot;pushed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;popped.&amp;quot; Typically, isolated references
alone (i.e., individual pronouns or definite descriptions) do not suffice. Many dif-
ferent cues have been discussed in the literature, including cue phrases (Hirschberg
and Litman 1993; Sidner 1981), intonation (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Hirschberg
and Litman 1993; Nakatani 1997), repetition of previous content (Sidner 1979), and
tense (Polanyi 1988). With this in mind, we can examine dialogues A—C in Walker&apos;s
squib.
In comparing dialogues A and B, Walker argues that the utterance &amp;quot;as well as
her uh husband&amp;quot; is easy to interpret after a short interruption but more difficult to
interpret after a longer interruption.&apos; She claims that this argues against the stack
model because the length of the interruption is not a factor in that model. However,
Walker overlooks the fact that &amp;quot;as well as her uh husband&amp;quot; is a sentence fragment, and
thus depends on local attentional state for its interpretation. It may be this aspect of the
utterance rather than the pronoun that makes interpretation difficult. The alternative
continuation utterance, &amp;quot;OK, well, her husband also works&amp;quot; seems much easier to
interpret for both versions A and B.
Walker uses dialogue C to support her argument that IRUs provide evidence for
linear recency. The gist of her argument is that the material is repeated because it is
no longer salient and thus no longer in the cache. However, there are alternative ex-
planations of the function of this particular IRU, all of which are compatible with the
stack model. One is that the IRU is being used in part to help identify the discourse
intention to which attention is returning. That is, rather than identifying information
in main memory that needs to be made salient again, the IRU is a repetition that
helps to establish to which part of the dialogue (i.e., which focus space on the stack)
attention is now returning. In this example, attention is returning not merely to the
certificates, but to the advisor&apos;s diversification argument concerning them. With re-
spect to this kind of example, the cache and stack models differ in how they find the
information (by looking in main memory or in the stack), more than in what they do
once they find it. In either case, the IRU functions to identify the information (dis-
course segment content and purpose) to which attention is returning, i.e., to focus
(for the cache model) or refocus (for the stack model) attention on something previ-
ously salient. The difference is whether that material is found in main memory or in
the stack. To determine whether the stack model is appropriate, one would need to
determine whether other items in the focus space to which attention returns become
salient.
2 Intonation plays a major role in the ease or difficulty with which these spoken dialogues could be
interpreted. That role must be taken into account for processing claims to be supported.

4. Some Deficiencies of the Cache Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9633235">
Although the attentional state model leaves certain details unspecified (e.g., as Walker
notes, the depth of the stack), it makes specific claims about discourse segment struc-
ture, discourse segment purposes, and shifts in attentional state.&apos; The cache model,
as Walker presents it, leaves too many details unspecified to allow a similar level
of analysis or critique or solid comparison with the stack model. For such purposes
the memory organization, replacement policy, and retention must be more completely
specified. Some key questions are:
Memory organization: What is the structure and organization of main
memory? According to Walker&apos;s cache model if an entity is removed
from the cache it appears only in main memory and must be retrieved
from there. Main memory contains a vast amount of information. How
is the relevant information found? In particular, with an IRU, is the
information found in the same way on second retrieval as it was ini-
tially? Is there a claim that long-term memory in some way separates
out information in the current discourse? In what ways does this struc-
ture compare to the focus space stack?
Cache replacement policy: Does only a single entry get changed for
each new entity mentioned in the discourse or are entities related to
the old entry removed and others related to the just-mentioned entity
added? If such related entities are deleted or added to the cache, which
semantic or pragmatic properties determine sufficient relatedness?
Retention: On what specific basis (e.g., which particular discourse-
intentional relationships) are entities (preferentially) retained in the
cache?

5. Some Problems with Walker&apos;s Comparison of the Models
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999165625">
In Section 5 of the squib, Walker compares the stack and cache models along a number
of dimensions. Although her description of the effects in the stack model as partic-
ipants shift between different discourse intentions is mostly accurate, the statement
under the second bullet that entities in the focus space are no longer accessible is
misleading. These entities are accessible, but access is more complex and less efficient,
because they are no longer stack-accessible, i.e., they cannot be retrieved through the
stack. However, they are accessible in memory just as they were before and just as the
cache model requires for anything removed from the cache.
More importantly, the cache model is incomplete in ways that are essential to de-
ciding between the two models. No definition is given of &amp;quot;related to new intention&amp;quot;
(first bullet) or &amp;quot;related to prior intention&amp;quot; (third bullet). Without these specifications
it is unclear what material not explicitly mentioned is brought into the cache. A spec-
ification of the cache replacement strategy is essential to determining the appropri-
ateness of the cache model when intentions are completed (bullet 2). The statement
that the cache &amp;quot;retrieves entities related to the prior intention from the main memory
to the cache, unless retained in the cache,&amp;quot; leaves unanswered two critical processing

<footnote confidence="0.46341925">
3 There are, in addition, several well-recognized problems with the model. In particular, as used in
computer systems, stacks do not differentiate among different kinds of frames, but interruptions seem
to operate differently from normal embeddings (Grosz and Sidner 1986) and there are open issues in
explaining pronominal reference at discourse segment boundaries.

questions: (1) How is the cache searched for related entities and how is relatedness
determined? (2) How is a &amp;quot;prior intention&amp;quot; determined i.e., what memory is there for
intentional structure and how is that coordinated with information in main memory
so that the relevant information can be found? The stack model coordinates intentional
structure and attentional state to address just these issues.
Walker makes two problematic claims in comparing the two models&apos; treatments of
interruptions. First, dialogue A differs from dialogue B, in that the interruption in A is
three utterances long whereas that in B is five utterances. If this difference affects the
cache content as significantly as Walker&apos;s model requires, then the cache is very small;
it could not accommodate a very large discourse segment. But then one must ask
what happens in the cache model with a discourse segment that is longer than three
or four utterances. Would such a segment require that the reader or writer explicitly
repeat material that is five or more sentences back? Second, in discussing dialogue C
Walker says that without (22b), (22c), and (23) the inference required to understand
the discourse &amp;quot;requires more effort to process,&amp;quot; a claim that requires substantiation; in
particular, utterance (22a) followed by (24) without the and that is required because of
(22c) seems no more difficult to process than the fragment given. In both these cases,
more empirical investigation is needed to determine the appropriate model.
With respect to return pops, Walker has misconstrued Sidner&apos;s stacked focus con-
straint. This constraint was postulated before Sidner integrated her work on local focus
of attention with the focus-space stack work. Sidner&apos;s claim is significantly different
from Walker&apos;s. In particular, it stipulates which pronouns cannot be used for entities
other than those locally in focus (i.e., those that we now call centers of an utterance).
With respect to most of this discussion, Walker does not discuss the potential cost of
checking nonfocused entities, but this cost can only be low if very few entities are
checked, not all of long-term memory. In the air compressor (not pump!) example to
which she refers there was a room full of equipment that could have been made to
work and that was visually salient. An alternative to the explanations Walker provides
for the IRUs with return pops is that IRUs are a good way to shift attention to a prior
discourse intention and segment (hence focus space).
Finally, we note that the cache model does suggest an interesting research issue
that is not clearly raised in the stack model. In computer systems, when information is
moved from main memory to the cache, it is moved in blocks larger than the individual
piece of information that was initially sought. The guiding locality principle here is
spatial locality: programs typically need to access information (instructions and data)
that have addresses near each other in memory (Patterson and Hennessy 1996). The
processing trade-off that computer designers must address is one of processing time
versus hit rate: larger blocks take longer to move, but increase the likelihood that
subsequently needed information will be in the cache. Implicit focus (Grosz 197M)
and the treatment of functionally related entities (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995)
respond to a related issue in discourse processing, namely, what other than an entity
itself becomes focused when the entity is focused? Although it is widely acknowledged
that various related entities become salient (e.g., the door of a house, the time or
location of a meeting), the determination of the scope of what becomes salient remains
an open question (Grosz 1981). Whereas computer architects can depend on physical
proximity in memory, discourse processing requires measures of conceptual closeness.

processing is constrained by capacity limits, a position that is held by most, but not
all, cognitive psychologists. However, the psycholinguistic literature does not support
Walker&apos;s contention that a cache in combination with main memory, as is standard
in computational architectures, provides a good basis for a computational model of
human attentional capacity in processing discourse (Walker 1996b). The modal model
of memory, capturing common aspects of memory models of the 1960s and early 1970s,
had a short-term and long-term memory organization resembling cache—main memory
organization. However, research since then has caused cognitive psychologists to revise
their views of memory in ways that are not consistent with the idea that a cache-like
memory contributes to discourse processing.
The prominent work of Baddeley (1986) retains the notion of sharply limited ca-
pacity in working memory, but the component subsystems that have these limitations
(the articulatory loop and the visual-spatial sketchpad) represent information at levels
that are not directly useful in discourse processing of the sort with which Walker is
concerned. Baddeley advances the additional idea of a limited-capacity central exec-
utive that controls processing, but for this executive, the appropriate computational
analogy is the processor rather than the cache or memory. Kintsch&apos;s (1988) position
on short-term memory capacity (articulated in Kintsch &amp; van Dijk [19781) depends
on a general model of discourse-processing that incorporates many other processing
assumptions. In fact, Kintsch and van Dijk (1978) report that reducing the capacity of
the short-term buffer from four propositions to one proposition has no effect on how
well the discourse-processing model fits human subjects&apos; performance in recalling and
summarizing stories. In more recent work, Ericsson and Kintsch (1995) have argued
that the amount of information that is required for working memory to perform the
tasks ascribed to it far exceeds the capacity of the kinds of memory stores that are
studied using traditional short-term memory tasks. They have proposed that working
memory makes use of highly organized long-term memory. One source of evidence for
this view is that frequently people can easily resume a task that has been interrupted,
a kind of evidence that was also used to motivate the original stack model (Grosz
1977a). Walker also cites experimental research on pronoun interpretation and other
types of inference in support of her cache model. Clark and Sengul (1979) is cited in
support of the notion that pronoun interpretation is based on a linear backward search
of the text, but this research has been criticized for confounding distance between the
pronoun and its antecedent with topic shifts (Garnham 1987). Studies of local corefer-
ence (within discourse segments) clearly show that recency is not the primary factor in
human pronoun interpretation (see Gordon and Scearce [1995] for a review). Studies
of coreference beyond the local domain (called &amp;quot;reinstatement&amp;quot; in the psychological
literature) do not provide evidence of a powerful effect of recency in determining ease
of comprehension (O&apos;Brien et al. 1995). Other research cited by Walker does support
the idea that inference in human language comprehension is constrained, but it does
not provide a basis for distinguishing capacity-limited and focus-based approaches to
this constraint.

<abstract confidence="0.99066325">Walker (1996) presents a cache model of the operation of attention in the processing of discourse as an alternative to the focus space stack that was proposed previously by Grosz and Sidner (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986). In this squib, we present a critical analysis of the cache model and of Walker&apos;s supporting evidence from anaphora in discourses with interruptions and from informationally redundant utterances. We argue that the cache model is underdetermined in several ways that are crucial to a comparison of the two models and conclude that Walker has not established the superiority of the cache model. We also argue that psycholinguistic evidence does not support the cache model over the focus stack model.</abstract>

The modal model of memory, capturing common aspects of memory models of the 1960s and early 1970s, had a short-term and long-term memory organization resembling cache—main memory organization. However, research since then has caused cognitive psychologists to revise their views of memory in ways that are not consistent with the idea that a cache-like memory contributes to discourse processing. The prominent work of Baddeley (1986) retains the notion of sharply limited capacity in working memory, but the component subsystems that have these limitations (the articulatory loop and the visual-spatial sketchpad) represent information at levels that are not directly useful in discourse processing of the sort with which Walker is concerned. Baddeley advances the additional idea of a limited-capacity central executive that controls processing, but for this executive, the appropriate computational analogy is the processor rather than the cache or memory.

This distinction is important as we reexamine Walker&apos;s data and claims. The stack model requires that a speaker indicate to a hearer when attention is shifting from one discourse intention, and thus segment, to another. As a result of such shifts, focus spaces may be &amp;quot;pushed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;popped.&amp;quot; Typically, isolated references alone (i.e., individual pronouns or definite descriptions) do not suffice. Many different cues have been discussed in the literature, including cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Sidner 1981), intonation (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Nakatani 1997), repetition of previous content (Sidner 1979), and tense (Polanyi 1988). With this in mind, we can examine dialogues A—C in Walker&apos;s squib. In comparing dialogues A and B, Walker argues that the utterance &amp;quot;as well as her uh husband&amp;quot; is easy to interpret after a short interruption but more difficult to interpret after a longer interruption.&apos; She claims that this argues against the stack model because the length of the interruption is not a factor in that model. However, Walker overlooks the fact that &amp;quot;as well as her uh husband&amp;quot; is a sentence fragment</context>

This fact has been important to computational research on discourse since the work of Grosz (1977b). A recent article by Walker (1996) argues that the attentional mechanism has limited capacity, that this limited capacity determines the accessibility of information in discourse processing, and that certain linguistic behavior can only be explained in terms of this limited capacity. Walker presents as an alternative to the focus space stack previously proposed to model global attentional state (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986) a cache model in which linear recency and a highly constrained cache capacity play primary roles. As critical evidence, Walker presents an analysis of anaphora in discourses with interruptions and of informationally redundant utterances (IRUs). In addition, she cites psychological evidence on the limited capacity of human information processing. In this response, we discuss the relationship between the focus-space stack model and the cache model, examine Walker&apos;s evidence with respect to the two models, and review psychological evidence concerning the contributions of limited capacity and rec</context>

The stack model claims only differences in speed and complexity of accessibility, not possibility of accessibility, among those items in the stack and those not. 3. Linguistic Evidence In her squib, Walker discusses two types of linguistic evidence: pronominal reference following interruptions and informationally redundant utterances. We first examine this evidence from the stack model perspective showing how the data might be accounted for within that model; we then raise some questions about Walker&apos;s cache model explanations. In earlier work (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986) we have argued that it is important to distinguish between two levels of discourse structure and processing: global and local. A focus-space stack was proposed as a model for the global level. The main claims about its use in processing have been for handling definite descriptions (Grosz 1977a; Grosz 1981) and reasoning about intentional structure (Lochbaum 1998). The local level &amp;quot;refers to the influence of a listener&apos;s memory for the linguistic form of an utterance (the actual words and the syntactic structure) on his interpretation of a subsequent utterance&amp;quot; (Grosz 1977b).1 According to thi</context>

(2) How is a &amp;quot;prior intention&amp;quot; determined i.e., what memory is there for intentional structure and how is that coordinated with information in main memory so that the relevant information can be found?

Implicit focus (Grosz 197M) and the treatment of functionally related entities (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) respond to a related issue in discourse processing, namely, what other than an entity itself becomes focused when the entity is focused? Although it is widely acknowledged that various related entities become salient (e.g., the door of a house, the time or location of a meeting), the determination of the scope of what becomes salient remains an open question (Grosz 1981). Whereas computer architects can depend on physical proximity in memory, discourse processing requires measures of conceptual closeness. 6. The Psychology of Discourse Processing Like Walker, we support the integration of research in psycholinguistics and research in computational linguistics, and we support the contention that human information 622 Grosz and Gordon Limited Attention and Discourse Focus processing is constrained by capacity limits, a position that is held by most, but not all, cognitive psychologists.

In earlier work (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986) we have argued that it is important to distinguish between two levels of discourse structure and processing: global and local. A focus-space stack was proposed as a model for the global level. The main claims about its use in processing have been for handling definite descriptions (Grosz 1977a; Grosz 1981) and reasoning about intentional structure (Lochbaum 1998).

The term &amp;quot;cache&amp;quot; primarily refers to the smallest, fastest memory that is accessed first. Because the whole point of the cache is to speed up processing, cache management algorithms must be low cost. They are syntactic in the extreme, depending on physical properties of the system and making no reference to content. For discourse-processing algorithms, and for Walker&apos;s model, similar physical properties of human memory do not seem the issue and content (semantic and pragmatic) does matter. Only two of the central memory-hierarchy questions for computer architectures (Patterson and Hennessy 1996) are relevant to the discourse issues Walker raises: replacement strategy and how information is found in the cache. Walker does not specify a replacement strategy, but suggests consideration of a modification of the &amp;quot;least recently used&amp;quot; strategy that accommodates what she calls &amp;quot;preferential retention.&amp;quot; Preferential retention is not clearly defined in the squib; we are given no details on how items to be (preferentially) retained are identified nor on differences in treatment of retained items and those in the cache on some other basis. Preferential retention is said to depend on the intenti</context>

Finally, we note that the cache model does suggest an interesting research issue that is not clearly raised in the stack model. In computer systems, when information is moved from main memory to the cache, it is moved in blocks larger than the individual piece of information that was initially sought. The guiding locality principle here is spatial locality: programs typically need to access information (instructions and data) that have addresses near each other in memory (Patterson and Hennessy 1996). The processing trade-off that computer designers must address is one of processing time versus hit rate: larger blocks take longer to move, but increase the likelihood that subsequently needed information will be in the cache. Implicit focus (Grosz 197M) and the treatment of functionally related entities (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) respond to a related issue in discourse processing, namely, what other than an entity itself becomes focused when the entity is focused? Although it is widely acknowledged that various related entities become salient (e.g., the door of a house, the time or </context>

We argue that the cache model is underdetermined in several ways that are crucial to a comparison of the two models and conclude that Walker has not established the superiority of the cache model. We also argue that psycholinguistic evidence does not support the cache model over the focus stack model. 1. Introduction Attention constrains the structure and processing of discourse. This fact has been important to computational research on discourse since the work of Grosz (1977b). A recent article by Walker (1996) argues that the attentional mechanism has limited capacity, that this limited capacity determines the accessibility of information in discourse processing, and that certain linguistic behavior can only be explained in terms of this limited capacity. Walker presents as an alternative to the focus space stack previously proposed to model global attentional state (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986) a cache model in which linear recency and a highly constrained cache capacity play primary roles. As critical evidence, Walker presents an analysis of anaphora in discourses with interruptions and of</context>
<context position="6457" citStr="Walker 1996" startWordPosition="994" endWordPosition="995">t should be retained. Because intention-based preferential retention seems to be the main way Walker&apos;s cache model breaks out of a strict linear-recency approach, the lack of detail makes it difficult to ascertain exactly how it works, and more generally to establish how the model differs from the stack model. Walker does not discuss methods for searching the cache although issues of locating information in the cache are important in computer systems design. Instead, the cache model assumes the cache is sufficiently limited in size that everything in it is &amp;quot;almost instantaneously accessible&amp;quot; (Walker 1996, 258). Walker also does not define &amp;quot;strategically retrieve&amp;quot; nor specify how main memory is searched when items are not found in the cache. Because main memory is part of the cache model (see the quotation that starts this section), without such information it is difficult to evaluate the model. Hence, the main claims of the cache model seem to be that (1) the cache contains a small number of items; (2) as new entities are discussed in the discourse, entities not mentioned recently are removed from the cache to make room, and (3) remention and some (unspecified) connection with the current dis</context>

However, the psycholinguistic literature does not support Walker&apos;s contention that a cache in combination with main memory, as is standard in computational architectures, provides a good basis for a computational model of human attentional capacity in processing discourse (Walker 1996b). The modal model of memory, capturing common aspects of memory models of the 1960s and early 1970s, had a short-term and long-term memory organization resembling cache—main memory organization. However, research since then has caused cognitive psychologists to revise their views of memory in ways that are not consistent with the idea that a cache-like memory contributes to discourse processing. The prominent work of Baddeley (1986) retains the notion of sharply limited capacity in working memory, but the component subsystems that have these limitations (the articulatory loop and the visual-</context>
