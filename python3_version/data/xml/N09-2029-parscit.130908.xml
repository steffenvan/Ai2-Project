Contrastive summarization is the problem of
jointly generating summaries for two entities
in order to highlight their differences. In this
paper we present an investigation into con-
trastive summarization through an implemen-
tation and evaluation of a contrastive opinion
summarizer in the consumer reviews domain.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993952">
Automatic summarization has historically focused
on summarizing events, a task embodied in the
series of Document Understanding Conferences1.
However, there has also been work on entity-centric
summarization, which aims to produce summaries
from text collections that are relevant to a particu-
lar entity of interest, e.g., product, person, company,
etc. A well-known example of this is from the opin-
ion mining community where there has been a num-
ber of studies on summarizing the expressed senti-
ment towards entities (cf. Hu and Liu (2006)). An-
other recent example of entity-centric summariza-
tion is the work of Filippova et al. (2009) to produce
company-specific financial report summaries.
In this study we investigate a variation of entity-
centric summarization where the goal is not to sum-
marize information about a single entity, but pairs
of entities. Specifically, our aim is to jointly gen-
erate two summaries that highlight differences be-
tween the entities – a task we call contrastive sum-
marization. An obvious application comes from the
consumer reviews domain, where a person consider-
ing a purchase wishes to see the differences in opin-
ion about the top candidates without reading all the
reviews for each product. Other applications include

contrasting financial news about related companies
or comparing platforms of political candidates.
Contrastive summarization has many points of
comparison in the NLP, IR and Data-Mining liter-
ature. Jindal and Liu (2006) introduce techniques
to find and analyze explicit comparison sentences,
but this assumes that such sentences exist. In con-
trastive summarization, there is no assumption that
two entities have been explicitly compared. The
goal is to automatically generate the comparisons
based on the data. In the IR community, Sun et
al. (2006) explores retrieval systems that align query
results to highlight points of commonality and dif-
ference. In contrast, we attempt to identify con-
trasts from the data, and then generate summaries
that highlight them. The novelty detection task of
determining whether a new text in a collection con-
tains information distinct from that already gathered
is also related (Soboroff and Harman, 2005). The
primary difference here is that contrastive summa-
rization aims to extract information from one col-
lection not present in the other in addition to infor-
mation present in both collections that highlights a
difference between the entities.
This paper describes a contrastive summarization
experiment where the goal is to generate contrasting
opinion summaries of two products based on con-
sumer reviews of each. We look at model design
choices, describe an implementation of a contrastive
summarizer, and provide an evaluation demonstrat-
ing a significant improvement in the usefulness of
contrastive summaries versus summaries generated
by single-product opinion summarizers.

tain opinions about some product of interest. The
goal of opinion summarization2 is to select some
number of text excerpts to form a summary S of
the product so that S is representative of the aver-
age opinion and speaks to its important aspects (also
proportional to opinion), which we can formalize as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.969005">
S = arg max L(S) s.t. LENGTH(S) G K
S⊆T
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934846153846">
where L is some score over possible summaries that
embodies what a user might desire in an opinion
summary, LENGTH(S) is the length of the summary
and K is a pre-specified length constraint.
We assume the existence of standard sentiment
analysis tools to provide the information used in the
scoring function L. First, we assume the tools can
assign a sentiment score from -1 (negative) to 1 (pos-
itive) to an arbitrary span of text. Second, we as-
sume that we can extract a set of aspects that the text
is discussing (e.g, “The sound was crystal clear” is
about the aspect sound quality). We refer the reader
to abundance of literature on sentiment analysis for
more details on how such tools can be constructed
(cf. Pang and Lee (2008)). For this study, we use
the tools described and evaluated in Lerman et al.
(2009). We note however, that the subject of this
discussion is not the tools themselves, but their use.
The single product opinion summarizer we con-
sider is the Sentiment Aspect Match model (SAM)
described and evaluated in (Lerman et al., 2009).
Underlying SAM is the assumption that opinions
can be described by a bag-of-aspects generative pro-
cess where each aspect is generated independently
and the sentiment associated with the aspect is gen-
erated conditioned on its identity,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.987364">
p(t) = � p(a)p(SENT(at)|a)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923857142857">
where At is a set of aspects that are mentioned in
text excerpt t, p(a) is the probability of seeing aspect
a, and SENT(at) E [−1, 1] is the sentiment associ-
ated with aspect a in t. The SAM model sets p(a)
through the maximum likelihood estimates over T
and assumes p(SENT(at)|a) is normally distributed
with a mean and variance also estimated from T. We

those based on numeric ratings (Hu and Liu, 2006).
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995212">
denote SAM(T) as the model learned using the entire
set of candidate text excerpts T.
The SAM summarizer scores each potential sum-
mary, S, by learning another model SAM(S) based
on the text excerpts used to construct S. We can then
measure the distance between a model learned over
the full set T and a summary S by summing the KL-
divergence between their learned probability distri-
butions. In our case we have 1 + |AT |distributions
– p(a), and p(·|a) for all a E AT. We then define L:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.90283">
L(S) = −KL(SAM(T), SAM(S))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883555555555">
That is, the SAM summarizer prefers summaries
whose induced model is close to the model induced
for all the opinions about the product of interest.
Thus, a good summary should (1) mention aspects in
roughly the same proportion that they are mentioned
in the full set of opinions and (2) mention aspects
with sentiment also in proportion to what is observed
in the full opinion set. A high scoring summary is
found by initializing a summary with random sen-
tences and hill-climbing by replacing sentences one
at a time until convergence.
We chose to use the SAM model for our exper-
iment for two reasons. First, Lerman et al. (2009)
showed that among a set of different opinion sum-
marizers, SAM was rated highest in a user study.
Secondly, as we will show in the next section, the
SAM summarization model can be naturally ex-
tended to produce contrastive summaries.

3 Constrastive Summarization

<bodyText confidence="0.999975571428571">
When jointly generating pairs of summaries, we at-
tempt to highlight differences between two products.
These differences can take multiple forms. Clearly,
two products can have different prevailing sentiment
scores with respect to an aspect (e.g. “Product X has
great image quality” vs “Product Y’s image quality
is terrible”). Reviews of different products can also
emphasize different aspects. Perhaps one product’s
screen is particularly good or bad, but another’s is
not particularly noteworthy – or perhaps the other
product simply doesn’t have a screen. Regardless of
sentiment, reviews of the first product will empha-
size the screen quality aspect more than those of the
second, indicating that our summary should as well.

As input to our contrastive summarizer we assume
two products, call them x and y as well as two corre-
sponding candidate sets of opinions, Tx and Ty, re-
spectively. As output, a contrastive summarizer will
produce two summaries – Sx for product x and Sy
for product y – so that the summaries highlight the
differences in opinion between the two products.
What might a contrastive summarizer look like on
a high-level? Figure 1 presents some options. The
first example (1a) shows a system where each sum-
mary is generated independently, i.e., running the
SAM model on each product separately without re-
gard to the other. This procedure may provide some
useful contrastive information, but any such infor-
mation will be present incidentally. To make the
summaries specifically contrast each other, we can
modify our system by explicitly modeling the fact
that we want summaries Sx and Sy to contrast. In
the SAM model this is trivial as we can simply add a
term to the scoring function L that attempts to maxi-
mize the KL-divergence between the two summaries
induced models SAM(Sx) and SAM(Sy).
This approach is graphically depicted in figure 1b,
where the system attempts to produce summaries
that are maximally similar to the opinion set they are
drawn from and minimally similar from each other.
However, some obvious degenerate solutions arise
if we chose to model our system this way. Consider
two products, x and y, for which all opinions dis-
cuss two aspects a and b with identical frequency
and sentiment polarity. Furthermore, several opin-
ions of x and y discuss an aspect c, but with oppo-
site sentiment polarity. Suppose we have to build
contrastive summaries and only have enough space
to cover a single aspect. The highest scoring con-
trastive pair of summaries would consist of one for x
that mentions a exclusively, and one for y that men-
tions b exclusively – these summaries each mention
a promiment aspect of their product, and have no
overlap with each other. However, they provide a
false contrast because they each attempt to contrast
the other summary, rather than the other product.
Better would be for both to cover aspect c.
To remedy this, we reward summaries that in-
stead have a high KL-divergence with respect to the
other product’s full model SAM(T) as depicted in
Figure 1c. Under this setup, the degenerate solution
described above is no longer appealing, as both sum-
maries have the same KL-divergence with respect to
the other product as they do to their own product.
The fact that the summaries themselves are dissim-
ilar is irrelevant. Comparing the summaries only to
the products’ full language models prevents us from
rewarding summaries that convey a false contrast be-
tween the products under comparison. Specifically,
we now optimize the following joint summary score:
L(Sx, Sy) = −KL(SAM(Tx), SAM(Sx))
−KL(SAM(Ty), SAM(Sy))
+KL(SAM(Tx), SAM(Sy))
+KL(SAM(Ty), SAM(Sx))
Note that we could additionally model divergence
between the two summaries (i.e., merging models in
figures 1b and c), but such modeling is redundant.
Furthermore, by not explicitly modeling divergence
between the two summaries we simplify the search
space as each summary can be constructed without
knowledge of the content of the second summary.

<bodyText confidence="0.999640833333333">
Our experiments focused on consumer electronics.
In this setting an entity to be summarized is one spe-
cific product and T is a set of segmented user re-
views about that product. We gathered reviews for
56 electronics products from several sources such as
CNet, Epinions, and PriceGrabber. The products
covered 15 categories of electronics products, in-
cluding MP3 players, digital cameras, laptops, GPS
systems, and more. Each had at least four reviews,
and the mean number of reviews per product was 70.
We manually grouped the products into cate-
gories (MP3 players, cameras, printers, GPS sys-

tems, headphones, computers, and others), and gen-
erated contrastive summaries for each pair of prod-
ucts in the same category using 2 different algo-
rithms: (1) The SAM algorithm for each product in-
dividually (figure 1a) and (2) The SAM algorithm
with our adaptation for contrastive summarization
(figure 1c). Summaries were generated using K =
650, which typically consisted of 4 text excerpts of
roughly 160 characters. This allowed us to compare
different summaries without worrying about the ef-
fects of summary length on the ratings. In all, we
gathered 178 contrastive summaries (89 per system)
to be evaluated by raters and each summary was
evaluated by 3 random raters resulting in 534 rat-
ings. The raters were 55 everyday internet users
that signed-up for the experiment and were assigned
roughly 10 random ratings each. Raters were shown
two products and their contrastive summaries, and
were asked to list 1-3 differences between the prod-
ucts as seen in the two summaries. They were also
asked to read the products’ reviews to help ensure
that the differences observed were not simply arti-
facts of the summarizer but in fact are reflected in
actual opinions. Finally, raters were asked to rate
the helpfulness of the summaries in identifying these
distinctions, rating each with an integer score from
0 (”extremely useful”) to 3 (”not useful”).
Upon examining the results, we found that raters
had a hard time finding a meaningful distinction be-
tween the two middle ratings of 1 and 2 (“useful”
and “somewhat useful”). We therefore present two
sets of results: one with the scores as received from
raters, and another with all 1 and 2 votes consol-
idated into a single class of votes with numerical
score 1.5. Table 1 gives the average scores per sys-
tem, lower scores indicating superior performance.

scores in the somewhat-useful to useful range. The
difference becomes more pronounced when look-
ing at the consolidated scores. The natural question
arises: does the relatively small increase in helpful-
ness reflect that the contrastive summarizer is doing
a poor job? Or does it indicate that users only find
slightly more utility in contrastive information in
this domain? We inspected comments left by raters
in an attempt to answer this. Roughly 80% of raters
were able to find at least two points of contrast in
summaries generated by the SAM+contrastive ver-
sus 40% for summaries generated by the simple
SAM model. We then examined the consistency
of rater comments, i.e., to what degree did differ-
ent raters identify the same points of contrast from a
specific comparison? We report the results in table 2.
Note that by this metric in particular, the contrastive
summarizer outperforms its the single-product sum-
marizer by significant margins and provides a strong
argument that the contrastive model is doing its job.

In contrastive summarization, there is no assumption that two entities have been explicitly compared. The goal is to automatically generate the comparisons based on the data. In the IR community, Sun et al. (2006) explores retrieval systems that align query results to highlight points of commonality and difference. In contrast, we attempt to identify contrasts from the data, and then generate summaries that highlight them. The novelty detection task of determining whether a new text in a collection contains information distinct from that already gathered is also related (Soboroff and Harman, 2005). The primary difference here is that contrastive summarization aims to extract information from one collection not present in the other in addition to information present in both collections that highlights a difference between the entities. This paper describes a contrastive summarization experiment where the goal is to generate contrasting opinion summaries of two products based on consumer reviews of each. We look at model design choices, describe an implementation of a contrastive summarizer, and provide an evaluation demonstrating a significant improvement in the usefulness of contrastiv</context>

Contrastive summarization has many points of comparison in the NLP, IR and Data-Mining literature. Jindal and Liu (2006) introduce techniques to find and analyze explicit comparison sentences, but this assumes that such sentences exist. In contrastive summarization, there is no assumption that two entities have been explicitly compared. The goal is to automatically generate the comparisons based on the data.
