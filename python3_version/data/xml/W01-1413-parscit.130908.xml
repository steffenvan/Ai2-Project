We present a system for extracting an
English translation of a given Japanese
technical term by collecting and scor-
ing translation candidates from the web.
We first show that there are a lot of par-
tially bilingual documents in the web
that could be useful for term translation,
discovered by using a commercial tech-
nical term dictionary and an Internet
search engine. We then present an al-
gorithm for obtaining translation candi-
dates based on the distance of Japanese
and English terms in web documents,

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988828768115942">
In the field of computational linguistics, the term
‘bilingual text’ is often used as a synonym for
‘parallel text’, which is a pair of texts written in
two different languages with the same semantic
contents. In Asian languages such as Japanese,
Chinese and Korean, however, there are a large
number of ‘partially bilingual texts’, in which the
monolingual text of an Asian language contains
several sporadically interlaced English words as
follows:
The above sentence is taken from a Japanese
medical document, which says “Since glaucoma
is now manageable if diagnosed early, macular
degeneration is becoming a major cause of visual
impairment in developed nations”. These par-
tially bilingual texts are typically found in tech-
nical documents, where the original English tech-
nical terms are indicated (usually in parenthesis)
just after the first usage of the Japanese techni-
cal terms. Even if you don’t know Japanese, you
can easily guess ‘ ’ is the translation of
‘macular degeneration’.
Partially bilingual texts can be used for ma-
chine translation and cross language information
retrieval, as well as bilingual lexicon construc-
tion, because they not only give a correspondence
between Japanese and English terms, but also
give the context in which the Japanese term is
translated to the English term. For example, the
Japanese word ‘ ’ can be translated into many
English words, such as ‘degeneration’, ‘denatu-
ration’, and ‘conversion’. However, the words in
the Japanese context such as ‘ (disease)’ and
‘ (impairment)’ can be used as informants
guiding the selection of the most appropriate En-
glish word.
In this paper, we investigate the possibility
of using web-sourced partially bilingual texts as
a continually-updated, wide-coverage bilingual
technical term dictionary.
Extracting the English translation of a given
Japanese technical term from the web on the fly
is different from collecting a set of arbitrary many
pairs of English and Japanese technical terms.
The former can be thought of example-based
“

lar degeneration)
”
translation, while the latter is a tool for bilingual
lexicon construction.
Internet portals are starting to provide on-
line bilingual dictionary and translation services.
However, technical terms and new words are un-
likely to be well covered because they are too spe-
cific or too new. The proposed term translation
extractor could be an useful Internet tool for hu-
man translators to complement the weakness of
existing on-line dictionaries and translation ser-
vices.
In the following sections, we first investigate
the coverage provided by partially bilingual texts
in the web as discovered by using a commercial
technical term dictionary and an Internet search
engine. We then present a simple algorithm
for extracting English translation candidates of a
given Japanese technical term. Finally, we report
the results of a preliminary experiment and dis-
cuss future work.

2.1 Coverage of Fields
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999664260869565">
It is very difficult to measure precisely in what
field of science there are a large number of par-
tially bilingual text in the web. However, it is
possible to get a rough estimate on the relative
amount in different fields, by asking a search
engine for documents containing both Japanese
and English technical terms in each field several
times.
For this purpose, we used a Japanese-to-
English technical term dictionary licensed from
NOVA, a maker of commercial machine transla-
tion systems. The dictionary is classified into 19
categories, ranging from aeronautics to ecology to
trade, as shown in Table 1. There are 1,082,594
pairs of Japanese and English technical terms1.
We randomly selected 30 pairs of Japanese
and English terms from each category and sent
queries to an Internet search engine, Google
(Google, 2001), to see whether there are any doc-
uments that contain both Japanese and English
technical terms. The fourth column in Table 1
shows the percentage of queries (J-E pairs) re-
turned by at least one document.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9671055">
1The dictionary can be searched in their web site (NOVA
Inc., 2000).
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996918">
It is very encouraging that, on average, 42% of
the queries returned at least one document. The
results show that the web is worth mining for
bilingual lexicon, in fields such as aeronautics,
computer, and law.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99971">
2.2 Classification of Format
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991604173913044">
In order to implement a term translation extractor,
we have to analyze the format, or structural pat-
tern of the partially bilingual documents. There
are at least three typical formats in the web. Fig-
ure 1 shows examples.
aligned paragraph format
table format
plain text format
In ‘aligned paragraph’ format, each paragraph
contains one language and the paragraphs with
different languages are interlaced. This format
is often found in web pages designed for both
Japanese and foreigners, such as official docu-
ments by governments and academic papers by
researchers (usually title and abstract only).
In ‘table’ format, each row contains a pair
of equivalent terms. They are not necessarily
marked by the TABLE tag of HTML. This for-
mat is often found in bilingual glossaries of which
there are many in the web. Some portals offer hy-
per links to such bilingual glossaries, such as ko-
toba.ne.jp (kotoba.ne.jp, 2000).
In ‘plain text’ format, phrases of different lan-
guage are interlaced in the monolingual text of
the baseline language. The vast majority of par-
tially bilingual documents in the web belongs to
this category.
The formats of the web documents are so
wildly different that it is impossible to automat-
ically classify them to estimate the relative quan-
tities belonging to each format. Instead, we exam-
ined the distance (in bytes) from a Japanese tech-
nical term to its corresponding English technical
term in the documents retrieved from the web by
the experiment described in the Section 2.1
Figure 2 shows the results. Positive distance
indicates that the English term appeared after the
Japanese term, while negative distance indicates
the reverse. It is observed that the English and
Japanese terms are likely to appear very close to

given Japanese technical term using a search en-
gine. We then eliminate the Japanese only doc-
uments. For each English term contained in
the (partially) bilingual documents, we compute
the translation probability , and select the
English term which has the highest translation
probability.
In practise, it is often prohibitive to down load
all documents that include the Japanese term.
Moreover, a reliable Japanese-English statisti-
cal translation model is not available at the mo-
ment because of the scarcity of parallel corpora.
Rather, one of the aim of this research is to collect
the resources for building such translation mod-
els. We therefore employed a very simplistic ap-
proach.
Instead of using all documents including the
Japanese term, we used only the predetermined
number of documents (top 100 documents based
on the rank given by the search engine). This en-
tails the risk of missing the documents including
the English terms we are looking for.
Instead of using a statistical translation model,
we used a scoring function in the form of a geo-
metric distribution as shown in Equation (1).

<equation confidence="0.930082">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985435">
Here, is the byte distance between
Japanese term and English term . It is divided
by 10 and the integer part of the quotient is used as
the variable in the geometric distribution (
indicates flooring operation). The parameter (the
average) of the geometric distribution is set to
0.6 in our experiment.
There is no theoretical background to the scor-
ing function Equation (1). It was designed, af-
ter a trial and error, so that the likelihood of can-
didates pairs being translations of each other de-
creases exponentially as the distance between the
two terms increases. Starting from the score of
0.6, it decreases 40% for every 10 bytes.
If we observed the same pair of Japanese and
English terms more than once, it is more likely
that they are valid translations. Therefore, we sum
the score of Equation (1) for each occurrence of
pair and select the highest scoring English
term as the translation of the Japanese term .

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999202">
4.1 Test Terms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999743590909091">
In order to factor out the characteristics of the
search engine and the proposed term extraction
algorithm, we used, as a test set, those words that
are guaranteed to have at lease one retrieved doc-
ument that includes both Japanese and English
terms.
First, we randomly selected 50 pairs of such
Japanese and English terms, from the pairs used
in the experiment described in Section 2.1. They
are shown in Figure 2. We then sent each
Japanese term as a query to an Internet search en-
gine, Google, and down loaded the top 100 web
documents. “o” indicates that at least one of the
down loaded documents included both terms. “x”
indicates that no document included both terms.
This resulted in a test set of 34 pairs of Japanese
and English terms.
For example, although there are a lot of doc-
uments which include both “ ” and “west”, the
top 100 documents retrieved by “ ” as the query
did not contain “west” since “ ” is a highly fre-
quent Japanese word.

4.2 Extraction Accuracy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993830944444444">
Table 3 shows the extraction accuracy of the En-
glish translation of Japanese term. Since both
Japanese and English terms could occur as a sub-
part of more longer terms, we need to consider lo-
cal alignment to extract the English subpart corre-
sponding to the Japanese query. Instead of doing
this alignment, we introduced two partial match
measures as well as exact matching.
In Table 3, ‘exact’ indicates that the output
is exactly matched to the correct answer, while
‘partial-1’ indicates that the correct answer was a
subpart of the output; ‘partial-2’ indicates that at
least one word of the output is a subpart of the
correct answer.
For example, the eye disease ‘ ’,
whose translation is ‘macular degeneration’, is
sometimes more formally refereed to as ‘
’, whose translation is ‘age-related
macular degeneration’. ‘Partial-1’ holds if ‘age-
related macular degeneration’ is extracted when
the query is ‘
generation’ is included in the output when the
query is ‘ ’.
It is encouraging that useful outputs (either ex-
act or partial matches) are included in the top 10
candidates with the probability of around 60%.
Since we used simple string matching to mea-
sure the accuracy automatically, the evaluation re-
ported in Table 3 is very conservative. Because
the output contains acronyms, synonyms, and re-
lated words, the overall performance of the sys-
tem is fairly credible.
For example, the extracted translations for the
query ‘ ’ (National Information In-
frastructure) were as follows, where the second
candidate is the correct answer.

<bodyText confidence="0.890858333333333">
NII (nii) is the acronym for National Informa-
tion Infrastructure, while GII (gii) and UNII (unii)
stand for Global Information Infrastructure and
Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure,
respectively.
If the query is a chemical substance, its molec-
ular formula, instead of acronym, is often ex-
tracted, such as ‘HCOOCH3’ for ‘ ’

As for synonyms, although we took ‘operating

‘partial-2’ because ‘operating’ is a subpart of the
correct answer.

ing cost divided by the gross operating profit. ‘Fa’

ument on accounting to stand for ‘operating ex-
penses’, such as “
where ‘ ’ means ‘cost’.
The following example is a combination of the
acronyms, synonyms and related words, which is,
in a sense, a typical output of the proposed sys-
tem. The query is ‘ ’, and ‘climate study’
is the translation we assumed to be correct.

A subpart of the 9th candidate ‘climate re-

is the acronym for ‘World Climate Research Pro-
gramme’, which is the 9th candidate and is trans-
lated to ‘ ’ which includes the
original Japanese query. ‘WMO’ stands for World
Meteorological Organization, which hosts this in-
ternational program.
In short, if you look at the extracted transla-
tions together with the context from which they
are extracted, you can learn a lot about the rele-
vant information of the query term and its trans-
lation candidates. We think this is a useful tool
for human translators, and it could provide a use-
ful resource for statistical machine translation and
cross language information retrieval.

5 Discussion and Related Works
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922577777778">
Previous studies on bilingual text mainly focused
on either parallel texts, non-parallel texts, or com-
parable texts, in which a pair of texts are written
in two different languages (Veronis, 2000). How-
ever, except for governmental documents from
Canada (English/French) and Hong Kong (Chi-
nese/English), bilingual texts are usually subject
to such limitations as licensing conditions, us-
age fees, domains, language pairs, etc. One ap-
proach that partially overcomes these limitations
is to collect parallel texts from the web (Nie et al.,
1999; Resnik, 1999).
To provide better coverage with fewer restric-
tions, we focused on partially bilingual text. Con-
sidering the enormous volume of such texts and
the variety of fields covered, we believe they are
the best resource to mine for MT-related applica-
tions that involve English and Asian languages.
The current system for extracting the transla-
tion of a given term is more similar to the in-
formation extraction system for term descriptions
(Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000) than any other ma-
chine translation systems. In order to collect de-
scriptions for technical term X, such as ‘data min-
ing’, (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000) collected phrases
like “X is Y” and “X is defined as Y”, from the
web. As our system used a scoring function based
solely on byte distance, introducing this kind of
pattern matching might improve its accuracy.
Practically speaking, the factor that most in-
fluences the accuracy of the term translation ex-
tractor is the set of documents returned from the
search engine. In order to evaluate the system, we
used a test set that guarantees to contain at least
one document with both the Japanese term and its
English translation; this is a rather optimistic as-
sumption.
Since the search engine is an uncontrollable
factor, one possible solution is to make your own
search engine. We are very interested in combin-
ing such ideas as focused crawling (Chakrabarti
et al., 1999) and domain-specific Internet portals
(McCallum et al., 2000) with the proposed term
translation extractor to develop a domain-specific
on-line dictionary service.

One interesting approach to extending the cur-
rent system is to introduce a statistical translation
model (Brown et al., 1993) to filter out irrelevant
translation candidates and to extract the most ap-
propriate subpart from a long English sequence
as the translation by locally aligning the Japanese
and English sequences.
Unlike ordinary machine translation which
generates English sentences from Japanese sen-
tences, this is a recognition-type application
which identifies whether or not a Japanese term
and an English term are translations of each other.
Considering the fact that what the statistical trans-
lation model provides is the joint probability of
Japanese and English phrases, this could be a
more natural and prospective application of statis-
tical translation model than sentence-to-sentence
translation.

<abstract confidence="0.991893875">We present a system for extracting an English translation of a given Japanese technical term by collecting and scoring translation candidates from the web. We first show that there are a lot of partially bilingual documents in the web that could be useful for term translation, discovered by using a commercial technical term dictionary and an Internet search engine. We then present an algorithm for obtaining translation candidates based on the distance of Japanese and English terms in web documents, and report the results of a preliminary experiment.</abstract>

Unlike ordinary machine translation which generates English sentences from Japanese sentences, this is a recognition-type application which identifies whether or not a Japanese term and an English term are translations of each other. Considering the fact that what the statistical translation model provides is the joint probability of Japanese and English phrases, this could be a more natural and pros</context>

To provide better coverage with fewer restrictions, we focused on partially bilingual text. Considering the enormous volume of such texts and the variety of fields covered, we believe they are the best resource to mine for MT-related applications that involve English and Asian languages. The current system for extracting the translation of a given term is more similar to the information extraction system for term descriptions (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000) than any other machine translation systems. In order to collect descriptions for technical term X, such as ‘data mining’, (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000) collected phrases like “X is Y” and “X is defined as Y”, from the web. As our system used a scoring function based solely on byte distance, introducing this kind of pattern matching might improve its accuracy. Practically speaking, the factor that most influences the accuracy of the term translation extractor is the set of documents returned from the search engine.

For this purpose, we used a Japanese-toEnglish technical term dictionary licensed from NOVA, a maker of commercial machine translation systems. The dictionary is classified into 19 categories, ranging from aeronautics to ecology to trade, as shown in Table 1. There are 1,082,594 pairs of Japanese and English technical terms1. We randomly selected 30 pairs of Japanese and English terms from each category and sent queries to an Internet search engine, Google (Google, 2001), to see whether there are any documents that contain both Japanese and English technical terms. The fourth column in Table 1 shows the percentage of queries (J-E pairs) returned by at least one document. 1The dictionary can be searched in their web site (NOVA Inc., 2000). It is very encouraging that, on average, 42% of the queries returned at least one document. The results show that the web is worth mining for bilingual lexicon, in fields such as aeronautics, computer, and law. 2.2 Classification of Format In order to implement a term translation extractor, we have to analyze the format, or </context>

This format is often found in web pages designed for both Japanese and foreigners, such as official documents by governments and academic papers by researchers (usually title and abstract only). In ‘table’ format, each row contains a pair of equivalent terms. They are not necessarily marked by the TABLE tag of HTML. This format is often found in bilingual glossaries of which there are many in the web. Some portals offer hyper links to such bilingual glossaries, such as kotoba.ne.jp (kotoba.ne.jp, 2000). In ‘plain text’ format, phrases of different language are interlaced in the monolingual text of the baseline language. The vast majority of partially bilingual documents in the web belongs to this category. The formats of the web documents are so wildly different that it is impossible to automatically classify them to estimate the relative quantities belonging to each format. Instead, we examined the distance (in bytes) from a Japanese technical term to its corresponding English technical term in the documents retrieved from the web by the experiment described in the Section 2.1 Figure 2 sho</context>

Practically speaking, the factor that most influences the accuracy of the term translation extractor is the set of documents returned from the search engine. In order to evaluate the system, we used a test set that guarantees to contain at least one document with both the Japanese term and its English translation; this is a rather optimistic assumption. Since the search engine is an uncontrollable factor, one possible solution is to make your own search engine.
