Research in automated grammatical error detection and correction has gained consid-
erable momentum in the past few years. Although much progress has been made in
this area, numerous challenges and opportunities exist for further research. For NLP
researchers and students who are considering following or pursuing work in this area
and for English language teaching practitioners and researchers who are interested in
utilizing systems resulting from research in this area, this book by Leacock, Chodorow,
Gamon, and Tetreault provides a timely, updated review of the state of the art in
automatic learner error detection and correction.
The introductory chapter first highlights the growth in prominence of the field of
grammatical error detection and correction since the publication of the first edition of
the volume. It then orients the reader to the book by detailing the changes from the first
edition, providing a working definition of grammatical error, justifying the book’s focus
on English language learners, clarifying the use of the term “English language learner”
to refer to learners of English as either a second or foreign language, putting forth a few
claims about the relationship between NLP and Computer-Assisted Language Learning
(CALL), specifying the intended audience of the book, and outlining the structure of
the book.
Chapter 2 provides the historical context for automated grammatical error detection
and correction. The chapter first discusses how varying degrees of tolerance of gram-
matical errors are achieved in computational grammars used in grammar-checking
and proofreading tools. It then offers a quick overview of data-driven and hybrid
approaches to error detection.
Chapter 3 summarizes the types of errors made by English language learners as
reported in previous empirical and corpus-based learner error studies, touches upon
the influence of L1 on learner English, and then delves into a detailed discussion of
three specific problem areas for English language learners: prepositions, articles, and
collocations.
Chapter 4 focuses on the evaluation of error detection systems. The chapter first
introduces traditional evaluation measures (e.g., precision, recall, F-score, accuracy, and
kappa) and the evaluation measures adopted in recent shared tasks on grammatical er-
ror correction. It then discusses evaluation using a corpus of correct usage, questioning
the value of this approach for indicating how well the system may perform on actual
learner data. The advantages and challenges of evaluating system performance on

learner writing are then examined. The authors advocate the use of multiple annotators
and crowdsourcing as a means to improve the reliability of manual evaluation. The
chapter concludes with a discussion of how statistical significance testing of differences
in system performance may be performed and provides a checklist for consistent re-
porting of system results.
Chapter 5 zooms in on data-driven approaches to detecting and correcting article
and preposition errors. The chapter first looks at four types of information used by
different systems, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, and source information. It then
describes three prevailing types of data used to train statistical models of grammatical
error correction, namely, well-formed text, artificial errors, and error-annotated learner
corpora. Next, it discusses classification methods and n-gram statistics-related methods
for error detection and correction. Finally, the chapter presents two end-to-end systems,
Criterion and MSR ESL Assistant.
Chapter 6 focuses on collocation errors. Following a brief discussion of the prop-
erties of collocations, the chapter introduces a range of metrics commonly used to
measure the association strength between pairs of words and reviews a number of
recent collocation error detection and correction systems.
Chapter 7 moves beyond article, preposition, and collocation errors and examines
rule-based and statistical methods for detecting and correcting verb-form, spelling, and
punctuation errors and for identifying ungrammatical sentences. A small number of
error detection systems for learners of languages other than English are also discussed.
Chapter 8 covers issues with learner error annotation, describes examples of com-
prehensive and targeted annotation schemes, and proposes three methods for im-
proving the efficiency of large-scale annotation: sampling, crowdsourcing, and mining
online revision logs.
Chapter 9 highlights several exciting emerging directions in the field of automated
grammatical error correction. These include three recent shared tasks on grammatical
error correction, the use of machine translation techniques for grammatical error correc-
tion, real-time crowdsourcing of grammatical error correction, and longitudinal studies
on the efficacy of automated error correction systems for improving the writing of users
of such systems.
Chapter 10 concludes the book with several suggestions for future research in
the field, including annotation for evaluation, error detection for underrepresented
languages, research on understudied error types, L1-specific error detection modules,
collaboration with second language learning and education groups, and applications of
grammatical error correction. The book also includes an Appendix that contains a list of
textual learner corpora with at least some publicly accessible URLs or references.
I very strongly recommend this book to all NLP students and researchers who are
interested in learning about, following, or pursuing research in automated grammatical
error detection and correction. Not only does it offer a comprehensive systematic review
of research in this field, but it also highlights real challenges and opportunities for
fruitful future research. Practitioners and researchers in the language teaching and
CALL community can also use this book to obtain a realistic understanding of the state
of the art of the field. They will also most certainly welcome the volume’s repeated
emphasis on the importance for the NLP community to join efforts with the language
teaching and CALL community to assess the effect of automated grammatical correction
systems on improving the quality of language learners’ writing.
I have just two minor quibbles with this book. First, it seems that the title may
better reflect the content of the book and the goals of the research field in question
with the words “and correction” added after “detection.” Second, in both Chapter 3

and Chapter 6, native speakers’ preference of powerful computer over strong computer
is cited as an example of the arbitrariness of collocations. I do not intend to delve
into the debate over whether collocations are arbitrary or linguistically motivated,
but I note that the preference in this particular case is not arbitrary but semantically
motivated (consider the semantic difference between powerful man and strong man). In
fact, this preference merely reflects the fact that we are generally more concerned about
the functional power of computers than their physical build, and it would be a false
positive if a system marks strong computer as an error in a sentence that talks about a
computer that is well-built and not easily breakable.
