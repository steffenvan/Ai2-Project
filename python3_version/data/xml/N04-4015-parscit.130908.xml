We present a novel morphological
analysis technique which induces a
morphological and syntactic symmetry
between two languages with highly
asymmetrical morphological structures to
improve statistical machine translation
qualities. The technique pre-supposes
fine-grained segmentation of a word in
the morphologically rich language into
the sequence of prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es)
and part-of-speech tagging of the parallel
corpus. The algorithm identifies
morphemes to be merged or deleted in the
morphologically rich language to induce
the desired morphological and syntactic
symmetry. The technique improves
Arabic-to-English translation qualities
significantly when applied to IBM Model
1 and Phrase Translation Models trained
on the training corpus size ranging from
3,500 to 3.3 million sentence pairs.

<bodyText confidence="0.999744395348837">
Translation of two languages with highly
different morphological structures as exemplified
by Arabic and English poses a challenge to
successful implementation of statistical machine
translation models (Brown et al. 1993). Rarely
occurring inflected forms of a stem in Arabic
often do not accurately translate due to the
frequency imbalance with the corresponding
translation word in English. So called a word
(separated by a white space) in Arabic often
corresponds to more than one independent word
in English, posing a technical problem to the
source channel models. In the English-Arabic
sentence alignment shown in Figure 1, Arabic
word AlAHmr (written in Buckwalter
transliteration) is aligned to two English words
‘the red’, and llmEArDp to three English words
‘of the opposition.’ In this paper, we present a
technique to induce a morphological and
syntactic symmetry between two languages with
different morphological structures for statistical
translation quality improvement.
The technique is implemented as a two-step
morphological processing for word-based
translation models. We first apply word
segmentation to Arabic, segmenting a word into
prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es). Arabic-English
sentence alignment after Arabic word
segmentation is illustrated in Figure 2, where one
Arabic morpheme is aligned to one or zero
English word. We then apply the proposed
technique to the word segmented Arabic corpus
to identify prefixes/suffixes to be merged into
their stems or deleted to induce a symmetrical
morphological structure. Arabic-English
sentence alignment after Arabic morphological
analysis is shown in Figure 3, where the suffix p
is merged into their stems mwAjh and mEArd.
For phrase translation models, we apply
additional morphological analysis induced from
noun phrase parsing of Arabic to accomplish a
syntactic as well as morphological symmetry
between the two languages.

We pre-suppose segmentation of a word into
prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es), as described in (Lee et
al. 2003) The category prefix and suffix
encompasses function words such as conjunction
markers, prepositions, pronouns, determiners and
all inflectional morphemes of the language. If a
word token contains more than one prefix and/or
suffix, we posit multiple prefixes/suffixes per
stem. A sample word segmented Arabic text is
given below, where prefixes are marked with #,
and suffixes with +.

3.1 Method

<bodyText confidence="0.941068">
We apply part-speech tagging to a symbol
tokenized and word segmented Arabic and
symbol-tokenized English parallel corpus. We
then viterbi-align the part-of-speech tagged
parallel corpus, using translation parameters
obtained via Model 1 training of word
segmented Arabic and symbol-tokenized English,
to derive the conditional probability of an
English part-of-speech tag given the combination
of an Arabic prefix and its part-of-speech or an
Arabic suffix and its part-of-speech.1
1 We have used an Arabic part-of-speech tagger with
around 120 tags, and an English part-of-speech tagger
with around 55 tags.

The algorithm utilizes two sets of translation
probabilities to determine merge/deletion
analysis of a morpheme. We obtain tag-to-tag
translation probabilities according to (1), which
identifies the most probable part-of-speech
correspondences between Arabic (tagA) and
English (tagE).

3.2.2 Phrase Translation Model
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.922944266666667">
For phrase translation models (Och and Ney
2002), we induce additional merge/deletion
analysis on the basis of base noun phrase parsing
of Arabic. One major asymmetry between
Arabic and English is caused by more frequent
use of the determiner Al# in Arabic compared
with its counterpart the in English. We apply
Al#-deletion to Arabic noun phrases so that only
the first occurrence of Al# in a noun phrase is
retained. All instances of Al# occurring before a
proper noun – as in Al# qds, whose literal
translation is the Jerusalem – are also deleted.
Unlike the automatic induction of morphological
analysis described in 3.2.1, Al#-deletion analysis
is manually induced.

3.2.1 IBM Model 1
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998772378378379">
The algorithm for word-based translation model,
e.g. IBM Model 1, implements the idea that if a
morpheme in one language is robustly translated
into a distinct part-of-speech in the other
language, the morpheme is very likely to have its
independent counterpart in the other language.
Therefore, a robust overlap of tagE given tagA
between Pr(tagE|tagA) and Pr(tagE|stemtagA,
suffixj_tagjk) for a suffix and Pr(tagE|tagA) and
Pr(tagE|prefixi_tagik, stemtagA) for a prefix is a
positive indicator that the Arabic prefix/suffix
has an independent counterpart in English. If the
overlap is weak or doesn’t exist, the prefix/suffix
is unlikely to have an independent counterpart
and is subject to merge/deletion analysis.3
Step 1: For each tagA, select the top 3 most
probable tagE from Pr(tagE|tagA).
Step 2: Partition all prefixi_tagik and suffixj_tagjk
into two groups in each stemtagA context.
Group I: At least one of ‘tagE|tagik’ or
‘tagE|tagjk’ occurs as one of the top 3 most
probable translation pairs in Pr(tagE|tagA).
Prefixes and suffixes in this group are likely to
have their independent counterparts in English.
Group II: None of ‘tagE|tagik’ or ‘tagE|tagjk’
occurs as one of the top 3 most probable
translation pairs in Pr(tagE|tagA). Prefixes and
suffixes in this group are unlikely to have their
independent counterparts in English.
Step 3: Determine the merge/deletion analysis
of the prefixes/suffixes in Group II as follows: If
prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurs in more than one
stemtagA context, and its translation probability
into NULL tag is the highest, delete the
prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk in the stemtagA context.
If prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurs in more than
one stemtagA context, and its translation

Automatic induction of the desired linguistic
knowledge from a word/morpheme-aligned
parallel corpus is analogous to (Yarowsky et al.
2001). Word segmentation and merge/deletion
analysis in morphology is similar to parsing and
insertion operation in syntax by (Yamada and
Knight 2001). Symmetrization of linguistic
structures can also be found in (Niessen and Ney
2000).

deletion, cf. Phrase Translation Model, does not affect
the performance of IBM Model 1.

Impact of morphological analysis on IBM Model 1 Baseline performances are obtained by Model 1 training and decoding without any segmentation or morphological analysis on Arabic. BLEU scores under ‘morph analysis’ is obtained by Model 1 training on Arabic morphologically analyzed and English symboltokenized parallel corpus and Model 1 decoding on the Arabic morphologically analyzed input text.5 4.2 Phrase Translation Model Impact of Arabic morphological analysis on a phrase translation model with monotone decoding (Tillmann 2003), is shown in Table 3. corpus size baseline morph analysis 3.5K 0.17 0.24 35K 0.24 0.29 350K 0.32 0.36 3.3M 0.36 0.39 Table 3. Impact of morphological analysis on Phrase Translation Model BLEU scores under baseline and morph analysis are obtained in a manner analogous to Model 1 except that the morphological analysis for the phrase translation model is a combination of the automatically induced analysis for Model 1 plus the manually induced Al#-deletion in 3.2.2.
