Understanding query ambiguity in web search
remains an important open problem. In this
paper we reexamine query ambiguity by ana-
lyzing the result clickthrough data. Previously
proposed clickthrough-based metrics of query
ambiguity tend to conflate informational and
ambiguous queries. To distinguish between
these query classes, we introduce novel met-
rics based on the entropy of the click distri-
butions of individual searchers. Our exper-
iments over a clickthrough log of commer-
cial search engine demonstrate the benefits of
our approach for distinguishing informational
from truly ambiguous queries.

Since query interpretation is the first crucial step in
the operation of the web search engines, more re-
liable query intent classification, such as detecting
whether a query is ambiguous, could allow a search
engine to provide more diverse results, better query
suggestions, or otherwise improve user experience.
In this paper we re-examine query ambiguity
in connection with searcher clickthrough behavior.
That is, we posit that clickthrough information could
provide important evidence for classifying query
ambiguity. However, we find that previously pro-
posed clickthrough-based measures tend to conflate
informational and ambiguous queries. We propose a
novel clickthrough measure for query classification,
user click entropy, and show that it helps distinguish
between informational and truly ambiguous queries.
Previous research on this topic focused on binary
classification of query ambiguity. Notably, (Tee-
van et al., 2008) used click entropy as a proxy for
query ambiguity to estimate the potential for search
personalization. (Mei and Church, 2008) considered

click entropy as measure of search difficulty. More
broadly, clickthrough information has been used for
many other tasks such as improving search rank-
ing (Zhu and Mishne, 2009), learning semantic cat-
egories (Komachi et al., 2009), and for topical query
classification (Li et al., 2008). However, our work

2 Defining Query Ambiguity

<bodyText confidence="0.98372865">
In this study we focus on two orthogonal query in-
tent dimensions, adapted from the top level of user
goal taxonomies such as (Rose and Levinson, 2004).
Specifically, a query could be ambiguous or unam-
biguous; as well as informational or navigational.
Consider the example queries of each type below:
Ambiguous Unambiguous
Informational “al pacino” “lyrics”
Navigational “people” “google”
The query “al pacino”, the name of a famous ac-
tor, is a typical ambiguous and informational query.
In the clickthrough logs that we examined, the most
popular searcher destinations include sites with pic-
tures of Al Pacino, movie sites, and biography sites –
corresponding to different informational intents. In
contrast, the query “lyrics” has an unambiguous in-
formational intent, which is to explore websites with
song lyrics. For the ambiguous navigational query
“people”, popular destinations include people.com,
Yahoo People or People’s United Bank. Finally, the

query “google” is unambiguous and navigational,
with over 94% of the clicks on the Google’s home-
page.
Definitions of query classes: we now more for-
mally define the query classes we consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996326833333333">
• Clear: Unambiguous navigational query, such as
“google”.
• Informational: Unambiguous informational
query, such as “lyrics”
• Ambiguous: Ambiguous informational or navi-
gational query, such as “people” or “al pacino”.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893">
The key challenge in distinguishing the last two
classes, Informational and Ambiguous, is that the
overall clickthrough patterns for these classes are
similar: in both cases, there are clicks on many re-
sults, without a single dominant result for the query.

<bodyText confidence="0.999849727272727">
In this section we describe the features used to rep-
resent a query for intent classification, listed in Ta-
ble 1. In addition to popular features such as click-
through frequency and query length, we introduce
novel features related to user click entropy, to cap-
ture the distinction between informational and am-
biguous queries.
Overall Entropy: Previous methods for query classi-
fication utilize entropy of all result clicks for a query,
or overall entropy (the uncertainty associated with
obtaining a click on any specific result), defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9719465">
H(Rq) = − E p(r) log p(r)
rER,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9589025">
Rq is the set of results r, clicked by all users after
submitting the query q. For example, a clear query
“target” has the overall entropy of 0.36, and most
results corresponding to this query point to Target’s
company website. The click log data shows that
85% of the users click the Target website for this
query. In contrast, an unclear query “lyrics” has the
overall entropy of 2.26. However, overall entropy
is insufficient for distinguishing between informa-
tional and ambiguous queries. To fill this gap, we
introduce new clickthrough metrics to detect such
ambiguous queries.
User Entropy: Recall, that both informational
queries and ambiguous queries could have high
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.99505">
Figure 1: Frequency of ambiguous and informational
queries by Overall Entropy (a) and User Entropy (b).
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9910045">
overall entropy, making it difficult to distinguish
them. Thus, we introduce a new metric, user en-
tropy of a query q H(Uq), as the average entropy of
a distribution of clicks for each searcher:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9993635">
p(r) logp(r)
H(Uq) = |Uq|
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799846153846">
where Uq is the set of users who have submitted the
query q, and Ru is the set of results r, clicked by
the user u. For the example informational query
“lyrics”, a single user may click many different
URLs, thereby increasing user entropy of this query
to 0.317. While for an ambiguous query, which has
multiple meanings, a user typically searches for only
one meaning of this query at a time, so the results
clicked by each user will concentrate on one topic.
For example, the query “people” is ambiguous, and
has the overall entropy of 1.73 due to the variety
of URLs clicked. However, a particular user usu-
ally clicks only one of the websites, resulting in low
user entropy of 0.007. Figure 1 illustrates the dif-
ference in the distributions of informational and am-
biguous queries according to their overall and user
entropy values: more informational queries tend to
have medium to high User Entropy values, com-
pared to the truly ambiguous queries.
Domain Entropy: One problem with the above mea-
sures is that clickthrough data for individual URLs
is sparse. A common approach is to backoff to
the URLs domain, with the assumption that URLs
within the same domain usually relate to the same
topic or concept. Therefore, domain entropy H(Dq)
of a query may be more robust, and is defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.94842">
H(Dq) = − E p(d) log p(d)
dED,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987405">
where Dq are the domains of all URL clicked for
q. For example, the query “excite” is a navigational
and clear query, as all the different clicked URLs for
this query are within the same domain, excite.com.

4 Experimental Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999811518518518">
We describe the dataset and annotation process, and
then present and analyze the experimental results.
Dataset: We use an MSN Search query log
(from 2006 Microsoft data release) with 15 million
queries, from US users, sampled over one month.
Queries with click frequency under 10 are discarded.
As a result, 84,703 unique queries remained, which
form our universe of queries. To separately analyze
queries with different frequencies, we divide the
queries into three groups: low frequency group (10-
100 clicks), medium frequency group (100-1000
clicks) and high frequency group (over 1000 clicks).
From each group, we draw a random sample of 50
queries for manual labeling, for the total of 150
queries. Each query was labeled by three members
of our lab. The inter-annotator agreeement was 85%,
and Cohen’s Kappa value was 0.77.
Table 2 reports the distribution of query classes in
our dataset. Note that low frequency queries dom-
inate, but are equally represented in the data sam-
ples used for classification training and prediction
(we will separately analyze performance on differ-
ent query frequency groups).
Results: Table 3 shows that best classification re-
quired User Entropy features. The Weka classifiers
were Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (Lo-
gistic), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) .

clear category). For classification between clear
and unclear queries, the accuracy was 90%, preci-
sion was 91%, and recall was 90%. The results for
subsequently classifying ambiguous vs. information
queries are reported in Table 6. For this task, User
Entropy features are beneficial, while the x2 value or
Overall Entropy is 0, supporting our claim that User
Entropy is more useful for distinguishing informa-
tional from ambiguous queries.
Discussion: Interestingly, User Entropy does not
show a large effect on classification of High and
Medium frequency queries. However, as Table 2
indicates, High and Medium frequency queries are
largely clear (76% and 52%, respectively). As dis-
cussed above, User Entropy helps classify unclear
queries, but there are fewer such queries among
the High frequency group, which also tend to have
larger click entropy in general.
An ambiguous query is difficult to detect when
most users interpret it only one way. For instance,
query “ako” was annotated as ambiguous, as it could
refer to different popular websites, such as the site
for Army Knowledge Online and the company site
for A.K.O., Inc. However, most users select the re-
sult for the Army Knowledge Online site, making
the overall entropy low, resulting in prediction as
a clear query. On the positive side, we find that
User Entropy helps detect ambiguous queries, such
as “laguna beach”, which was labeled ambiguous as
it could refer to both a geographical location and a
popular MTV show. As a result, while the Overall
Entropy value of the clickthrough is high, the low
User Entropy value identifies the query as truly am-
biguous and not informational.
In summary, our techniques are of most help
for Low frequency queries and moderately helpful
for Medium frequency queries. These results are
promising, as Low frequency queries make up the
majority of queries processed by search engines, and
also contain the highest proportion of informational
queries, which our techniques can identify.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997153909090909">
We explored clickthrough-based metrics for dis-
tinguishing between ambiguous and informational
queries - which, while exhibiting similar overall
clickthrough distributions, can be more accurately
identified by using our User Entropy-based features.
We demonstrated substantial improvements for low-
frequency queries, which are the most frequent in
query logs. Hence, our results are likely to have no-
ticeable impact in a real search setting.

However, our work sheds new light on distinguishing between informational and ambiguous queries, by using clickthrough data. Our contributions include: • More precise definition of query ambiguity in terms of clickthrough behavior (Section 2). • Entropy-based formalization of resulting click behaviors (Section 3). • Empirical validation of our methods on a large real query and clickthrough log (Section 4). 2 Defining Query Ambiguity In this study we focus on two orthogonal query intent dimensions, adapted from the top level of user goal taxonomies such as (Rose and Levinson, 2004). Specifically, a query could be ambiguous or unambiguous; as well as informational or navigational. Consider the example queries of each type below: Ambiguous Unambiguous Informational “al pacino” “lyrics” Navigational “people” “google” The query “al pacino”, the name of a famous actor, is a typical ambiguous and informational query. In the clickthrough logs that we examined, the most popular searcher destinations include sites with pictures of Al Pacino, movie sites, and biography sites – corresponding to different informational intents. In contrast, the query “lyrics” has an unambiguous inf</context>

That is, we posit that clickthrough information could provide important evidence for classifying query ambiguity. However, we find that previously proposed clickthrough-based measures tend to conflate informational and ambiguous queries. We propose a novel clickthrough measure for query classification, user click entropy, and show that it helps distinguish between informational and truly ambiguous queries. Previous research on this topic focused on binary classification of query ambiguity. Notably, (Teevan et al., 2008) used click entropy as a proxy for query ambiguity to estimate the potential for search personalization. (Mei and Church, 2008) considered Eugene Agichtein Math &amp; Computer Science Department Emory University eugene@mathcs.emory.edu click entropy as measure of search difficulty. More broadly, clickthrough information has been used for many other tasks such as improving search ranking (Zhu and Mishne, 2009), learning semantic categories (Komachi et al., 2009), and for topical query classification (Li et al., 2008). However, our work sheds new light on distinguishing between informational and amb</context>
