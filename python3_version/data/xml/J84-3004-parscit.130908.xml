We are reasonably convinced by the remarks in Pullum (p.
182) that the sluicing construction, on which the argument
in Postal and Langendoen (p. 177) for the non-CFhood of
English is based, is not, contrary to what is assumed there,
subject to an intrasentential matching condition. Conse-
quently, the argument does not go through. However, we
believe that an analogous argument can be given, which is
not subject to Pullum&apos;s line of criticism.
Consider the somewhat stilted but unquestionably
grammatical doubling relative construction illustrated by
(1).
la. The FBI arrested some senator, which senator
committed suicide.
b. Some bourbon hater lover was nominated, which
bourbon hater lover fainted.
c. The president feared certain anti-Western demon-
strations, which anti-Western demonstrations never
took place.
d. Some mammals, which mammals are now able to
vote, are hostile to reptile rights.
It seems initially that there is a parallelism between this
construction and the sluicing construction used in our
previous argument, in that apparently wh-phrase must
match an antecedent in the same sentence. It might
appear that an analogue of Pullum&apos;s &amp;quot;intersentential&amp;quot; crit-
icism could be constructed for this case as well, since the
dialogues in (2) are well-formed.

2a. Speaker A: Certain mammals now control the U.S.
government.
Speaker B: Which mammals are not too intelligent.
b. Speaker A: He described certain bourbon hater lovers
to the convention.
Speaker B: Which bourbon hater lovers merit consid-
eration.

<bodyText confidence="0.999913833333333">
Thus, there is no general restriction limiting the wh-phrase
and its antecedent to the same sentence. Nonetheless,
there is such a restriction in at least one set of cases, name-
ly when the wh-phrase is itself adjoined to the antecedent
phrase, as in (1d). This restriction shows up in the ill-
formedness of dialogues like those in (3).

3a. Speaker A: Some mammals are hostile to reptile
rights.
Speaker B: *Some Boeing 747s, which mammals are
now able to vote, are being sold to the Saudis.
b. Speaker A: Some bourbon lover haters will be nomi-
nated.

<bodyText confidence="0.969170555555556">
Speaker B: *Some bourbon hater lovers, which bour-
bon lover haters merit consideration, have proposed to
raise the drinking age to 85.
Our suspicion is that when a doubling relative is
adjoined to a nominal not in sentence-final position that
nominal must be the antecedent of the wh-phrase. If so,
then in a relevant infinite subclass of cases, the relation
between a wh-phrase and its antecedent must be intrasen-
tential.

Now consider the required relation between such
wh-phrases and their antecedents. Clearly, it is not one of
morphological matching, as the well-formed examples in
(4) illustrate.
4a. Some typewriters, which machines were already obso-
lete when they were designed, have been ordered for
the department.
b. Some bourbon hater lovers, which individuals have
been nominated, merit consideration.
Rather, it is essentially the weak matching condition, (13),
of Postal and Langendoen (p. 177), that permits examples
such as those in (4) while disallowing such ungrammatical
sentences as those in (5).
5a. *Some machines, which typewriters were already

b. *Some individuals, which bourbon hater lovers have

Therefore, if one substitutes the doubling relative
construction for the sluicing construction in the proof
given in section 2 of Postal and Langendoen (p. 177), the
criticism that Pullum directs against the earlier proof
would not apply to the new one. Hence, if the assumptions
of these remarks are correct, the logic of the argument in
section 2 of Postal and Langendoen (p. 177) does suffice to
show that English is not CF.
