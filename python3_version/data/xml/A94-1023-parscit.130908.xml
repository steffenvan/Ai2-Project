Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999922666666667">
Biological specimens have historically been la-
beled with English descriptions of the location
of collection. To perform spatial, statistical,
or historic studies, these descriptions must be
converted into geodetic coordinates. A study
of the sublanguage used in the descriptions
shows much less frequent than typical usage of
observer-relative relations such as &amp;quot;left of,&amp;quot; but
shows problems with name ambiguity, finding
the referents of generic terms like &amp;quot;the stream,&amp;quot;
ordinal numbering of river forks and valley
branches, object-oriented prepositions (&amp;quot;be-
hind&amp;quot;), fuzzy boundaries (how close is &amp;quot;at,&amp;quot;
how far is still &amp;quot;north of&apos;), etc. The LEI system
implements a semi-automated understanding
of such location descriptions. Components of
LEI include a language analyzer, a geograph-
ical reasoner, an object-oriented geographic
knowledge base derived from US Geological
Survey digital maps with user input, and a
graphical user interface. LEI parses preposi-
tional phrases into spatial relations, converts
these into areas, then computes polygon over-
lays to find the intersection, and returns the
minimum bounding rectangle. The user is con-
sulted on unknown words/phrases and ambigu-
ous descriptions.

Many biological specimens collected in the pastl are la-
beled with only an English description of their location
of collection.2 To perform any statistical or spatial anal-
ysis of this historical data, these descriptions must be
converted into geodetic coordinates (latitude-longitude
or UTM), a time-consuming process that requires eye-
straining poring over maps to search for each location.

ural language descriptions, reasoning about the spatial re-

Talmy [1983], Herskovits [1986], and André et al. [1986]
among others have documented the many problems in in-
terpreting and using spatial prepositions. For example, in
and on have similar but different meanings: &amp;quot;in the car&amp;quot;
means within the car, while &amp;quot;on the car,&amp;quot; means on top of
the car. However, &amp;quot;on the bus/plane,&amp;quot; means within the
bus or plane. Also, each preposition typically has several
different meanings or usages. For example, one says &amp;quot;at
home,&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;at the bank,&amp;quot; and the meaning of &amp;quot;the plane
is at Honolulu airport,&amp;quot; is within the area of Honolulu air-
port, but the meaning of &amp;quot;the dog is at the telephone pole&amp;quot;
is not within the telephone pole, but near it. These context
dependent usages make interpretation and application of
spatial prepositions problematic.
Kuipers [1985], Davis [1986], Peuquet and Ci-Xiang
[1987], and Frank [1991] have investigated qualitative
and/or quantitative reasoning techniques for dealing with
spatial relations. Freeman [1975] and Mark and Frank
[1991] have identified commonly used spatial relations.

3 Characteristics of the Domain
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999745666666667">
Although general purpose natural language processing
(NLP) is beyond current state-of-the-art, limited domains
have frequently been amenable to NLP using specific
techniques because the domains use a &amp;quot;sublanguage,&amp;quot;
a fairly restricted subset of a general natural language,
which may have its own syntax and peculiarities. In this
case, an analysis of one thousand three hundred and forty
sample location descriptions from the Bishop Museum&apos;s
Herbarium Pacificum collection (accumulated by about
two hundred different collectors over a period of 160
years) shows a highly restricted use of language that is
amenable to understanding using specialized techniques.
Because these descriptions are meant to be read later
by a reader who is not at the site, they contain very few
observer relative descriptions (e.g., behind). Also, there
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999703125">
are limits to the scale of the descriptions. For example,
out of a thousand descriptions that were located manually,
about half of the descriptions were judged to be accurate
to within 1/3 of a mile and 73% accurate to within 1 mile.
At the other end, there were no descriptions with accu-
racy in the meter range and the best descriptions were
only accurate to within several tens of meters.
A typical location description is: &amp;quot;Punaluu Valley;
Castle Trail from Punaluu to Kaluanui Valley + stream,
on E. side of Northern Koolaus.&amp;quot; Associated acces-
sion information typically includes the date, collector
name(s), genus, elevation, the museum&apos;s collection num-
ber, and the collector&apos;s accession number. This sublan-
guage is made up mostly of named objects (e.g., &amp;quot;Punaluu
Valley&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Castle Trail&amp;quot;) and prepositional phrases
(e.g., from Punaluu to Kaluanui Valley + stream, on E.
side of Northern Koolaus). The relation of the collection
location to the unmodified named objects is almost al-
ways &amp;quot;within,&amp;quot; that is, the collection location is within the
area designated by the named geographic object. The in-
terpretation of the prepositions is somewhat simpler than
the general case because the sublanguage deals only with
a two dimensional cartographic space supplemented by
elevation markings. This sublanguage is relatively sim-
ple syntactically, but there are still many problems for
automatic interpretation of the sublanguage.
One of the most common problems in interpreting this
sublanguage is the inconsistent use of names. For exam-
ple, Waikane-Schofield Trail also appears as Schofield-
Waikane Trail, Schofield-Waikane Ditch Trail, Schofield
Trail, W-S Ditch Trail, Schofield Waikane Trail, and
Waikane Ditch Trail. A mountain like Kaala may be re-
ferred to as Mt Kaala, Mt. Kaala, Kaala Mts., Kaala
Mountain(s), Mount Kaala, Kaala Puu (puu is the Hawai-
ian word for mountain), Kaala Summit, or Kaala Range.
Another problem is that names are often not unique. For
example, Manoa is the name for Manoa Falls, Mama
Valley, Manoa Valley Park, Manoa Triangle Park, Manoa
Stream, Manoa Elementary School, Manoa Japanese
Language School, Manoa Tunnel, and Manoa Falls.
When Manoa appears by itself, which Manoa is meant
is usually clear from the context. In many cases, the
same name is even used for the same type of object (e.g.,
many cities have Elm Streets and Main Streets). Luckily,
similar objects with shared names tend to be geograph-
ically separated, otherwise confusion would result. An-
other very frequent problem is missing names. Collec-
tors often use generic terms like stream and gulch to re-
fer to landmarks that do have names. As before, the con-
text is usually enough to find the correct object reference
even without knowing the name. This heavy reliance on
context for disambiguation is also a frequent problem for
general purpose NLP systems.
A difficult problem is the interpretation of ordinal
numberings, which are used to differentiate forks of
streams and branches of valleys. For example, &amp;quot;3rd
branch S of S fork of Kahanaiki Stream,&amp;quot; refers to the
third branch after the main South fork of Kahanaiki
Stream counting from the head of the stream. Unfortu-
nately, this description could also refer to the 3rd branch
following the path of the collector going up the stream.
Similarly, &amp;quot;Honolulu Valley, 4th small gulch,&amp;quot; refers to
4th small gulch counting from the open head of the valley,
although this could easily be interpreted as the 4th small
gulch along some trail that might enter the valley from
some pass over the mountains at the tail end of the val-
ley. Another problem is the occasional use of land cover-
age types such as &amp;quot;middle Metrosideros forest,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;wooded
gulch,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Fern Forest.&amp;quot; Not only do most geograph-
ical databases lack land coverage information, but such
information changes frequently over time. Also, descrip-
tions sometimes refer to rainfall frequency, sun exposure
or other ephemeral attributes of the area: &amp;quot;in dryish for-
est,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;wet valley,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;deep shade in wet gulch,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;shady
hillside.&amp;quot;
Even after converting the location descriptions into the
appropriate spatial relations, there are still many prob-
lems in the correct interpretation of the relations. For
example, &amp;quot;along a stream&amp;quot; does not mean that the col-
lection site was in the stream, but within some distance
of the stream. The problem is what exactly is the value
of that distance. Even cardinal directions like &amp;quot;north of&amp;quot;
are fuzzy concepts. The region north of a point can be
bounded by two vectors pointing NE and NW (the trian-
gular model), but this model fails when computing north
of an object that is elongated in the E-W direction. Some
spatial relations like &amp;quot;in front of,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;behind,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;be-
yond&amp;quot; are relative to the observer&apos;s direction. Although
these are not very frequent (only 25 cases in the 1340
sample descriptions), they still appear. Other spatial re-
lations like &amp;quot;above&amp;quot; are dependent on understanding the
slope of elevation around the object.
To solve some of these problems, we have developed
and implemented the LEI system to partially automate
interpretation of this sublanguage. LEI is described in
the following section.

<bodyText confidence="0.999739533333333">
The LEI3 (Location and Elevation Interpreter) system is
an implementation of our algorithms for interpreting the
sublanguage of location description labels for biological
specimens. LEI is composed of four main components:
the language analyzer PPI, the geographical reasoner GR,
the user interface LEIview, and the geographic knowl-
edge base GKB. The geographic knowledge base con-
tains an object-oriented description of geographical ob-
jects such as valleys, streams, and waterfalls with their
associated locations and names. The user interface dis-
plays maps and allows users to add or modify object lo-
cations. The language analyzer parses the English loca-
tion description and produces a collection of spatial rela-
tions that relate the actual collection point to geograph-
ical objects. It uses knowledge of geographical objects

and their associated names from the geographic knowl-
edge base. The geographical reasoner translates spatial
relations from the language analyzer into polygons and
performs polygon intersection calculations to obtain the
area specified by the spatial relations. Each component
is described in detail below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.951241">
4.2 GKB, the Geographic Knowledge Base
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99959672">
LEI uses three U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) digital
cartographic databases as the starting point for GKB, the
Geographic Knowledge Base. These include the DLG
(Digital Line Graph), GNIS (Geographic Name Informa-
tion System), and DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Un-
fortunately, these databases are not object-oriented, that
is, they do not link the names in GNIS to the object loca-
tions in DLG. The GNIS database contains only names,
USGS quadrangles, a feature class, and the coordinates
of the name as it appears on a USGS map. The DLG
database contains a hierarchical organization of points,
line segments (composed of points), and areas (composed
of line segments) along with a two-level type hierarchy
composed of major and minor codes. Unfortunately,
the 60 plus GNIS feature classes do not correspond to
the over 200 DLG major and minor codes. The DEM
database consists of a raster style set of elevation values.
To convert the three USGS databases into a useful
object-oriented format requires human intervention to as-
sociate the names with the line and area objects (point
objects are already correctly located by the GNIS coordi-
nates). This process uses the LEIview component to dis-
play the appropriate section of the map to the user, then
displays names one by one along with the geographically
closest object of the same type as the name. The user can
confirm the match, ask for alternatives, or modify the set
of line segments or areas to give the actual location of the
named object. In many cases, there are no corresponding
objects, so the user must draw the outline of the area from
scratch. This is required for all valleys and mountains
since these are missing from the DLG specifications.
Determining the closest object of the same type re-
quires matching the GNIS feature class to appropriate
DLG major and minor codes. This is done using LEI&apos;s
own type hierarchy that includes type classes correspond-
ing to each GNIS feature class and to each DLG major
and minor code along with many bridging type classes
and higher level types. Given a GNIS feature class, LEI
first indexes into LEI&apos;s type hierarchy to find the cor-
responding LEI type. If this type has a corresponding
DLG code, then that is the most likely match. Less likely
matches consist of any subtypes that might have associ-
ated DLG codes. If there are no DLG codes at this type
level nor at subtype levels, then LEI searches up the hi-
erarchy for supertypes that have associated DLG codes.
Using this algorithm, the matching process manages to
find the correct match most of the time, so the user&apos;s time
is freed to worry about the many missing entries and er-
rors in USGS databases (e.g., rivers that extend into what
should be coastlines, disconnected lines, etc.).

4.3 LEIview, the User Interface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998762962963">
The LEIview component provides a graphical interface
that allows users to view maps; zoom; scroll; rearrange,
add, and delete layers of the map (including DLG lines,
GNIS names, and DEM elevations); search for named ob-
jects; enter points, line segments, or areas for new ob-
jects; modify existing objects; and view the results of
interpreting location descriptions (both the English de-
scription and the area resulting from processing are dis-
played). LEIview is written in C under X windows with
Motif widgets.
LEIview is used to associate names with object loca-
tions in building the GKB geographic knowledge base. It
is also used to display the results of interpreting location
descriptions. When there are sections of the description
that are not comprehensible to the PPI language analyzer,
LEI sends the description to LEIview, which displays the
description with the incomprehensible parts highlighted
and displays the regions corresponding to the understood
portions of the description. The user can tell LEI to ig-
nore the unknown parts of the description, delay process-
ing this description until later, send the description back
for reprocessing, or add new geographic objects by en-
tering new points, line segments, or areas and selecting
the corresponding words in the description. Any new ob-
jects are stored in GKB and the correspondence between
the words and the new object are stored in the PPI lan-
guage knowledge base.

4.4 PPI, the Language Analyzer
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99925476923077">
The PPI (Prepositional Phrase Interpreter) component is
responsible for parsing the natural language location de-
scriptions and converting them into spatial relations. PPI
uses the PAU4 parser and understander [Chin, 19921 to
interpret the English descriptions and convert them into
spatial relations represented in the MERA (Meta En-
tity Relation Attribute) semantic-network-style knowl-
edge representation language [Takeda et al., 19921. PAU
is an all-paths, chart-based, unification parser that com-
pletely integrates syntactic and semantic processing.
Figure 1 shows the MERA graph for the grammar rule,
PP &lt;_ Prep NP (i.e., a Prepositional-Phrase is a Preposi-
tion followed by Noun-Phrase), along with its semantic
interpretation. The node PP-pat represents the left-hand-
side of the rule, and the relations Pca (pattern component
A) and Pcb (pattern component B) point to the compo-
nents on the right-hand-side of the rule. The Ref relation
denotes the meaning of the rule: a Geographic-object that
has a Spatial-relation to some other Geographic-object.
The Unify relation between the Prep and the Spatial-
relation indicates that the meaning of the Prep should be
unified with the relation, Spatial-relation. Likewise, the
Unify relation between the NP and the lower Geographic-
object indicates that the meaning of the NP should be uni-
fied with the lower Geographic-object. Figure 2 speci-
fies the meaning of the Prep, &amp;quot;along&amp;quot; as an instance of

The interpretation of the PP &amp;quot;along Ainapo&amp;quot; demon-
strates how the integration of syntactic and semantic pro-
cessing in PAU allows the early use of semantic con-
straints to reject semantically anomalous parses. &amp;quot;Along
Ainapo&amp;quot; is ambiguous because Ainapo is both a trail and
an area. However, since &amp;quot;along&amp;quot; only applies to linear
objects such as trails, the Ainapo area interpretation is
rejected by PAU. This happens when PAU is applying
the grammar rule of Figure 1. When unifying the mean-
ing of the Prep &amp;quot;along&amp;quot; (shown in Figure 2) with the
Spatial-relation, the result is a Near relation. However,
the sources and sinks of both relations must also be uni-
fied. This changes the lower Geographic-object into a
Linear-object as seen in Figure 3, which shows the state
of the &amp;quot;PP 4-- Prep NP&amp;quot; rule just before parsing &amp;quot;Ainapo.&amp;quot;
In PAU, both meanings of Ainapo are tried in parallel.
The area meaning of Ainapo is rejected because an Area-
object cannot unify with a Linear-object. This leaves
only the Ainapo trail meaning to parse successfully.

the corresponding prepositions.

4.5 GR, the Geographical Reasoner
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986122106382979">
The GR (Geographical Reasoner) component takes the
output from the PPI component, which is a set of spatial
relations, converts these into polygons, performs poly-
gon overlay operations to find the common intersection
of all the polygons, computes the center of the mini-
mum bounding rectangle (mbr) of the polygon intersec-
tion, then returns the coordinates and centroid of the mbr.
GR like PPI is written in Common LISP and converses
with LEIview through UNIX sockets.
The first step is the most difficult since there are no
generally accepted algorithms for converting spatial rela-
tions into areas. For the spatial relations based on cardi-
nal directions such as East-of, Peuquet and Zhan (1987)
give a complex algorithm for determining if one poly-
gon is in a particular directional relationship with another.
Their algorithm takes into account the shapes of the poly-
gons (e.g., east of an elongated N-S polygon covers a dif-
ferent area than east of a small point polygon) and con-
siders polygons that partially enclose or intertwine one
another. Their algorithm is a refinement of the basic trian-
gular model (in which North is the open-ended triangular
region between two vectors pointing NE and NW), but
it still does not give any limits concerning the distance
between the polygons. Unfortunately there is no abso-
lute distance that forms the edge of the region North-of
some polygon. In a sense, the edge is given by the limit
of human sight in that direction.
The algorithm currently used in GR for interpreting
cardinal-direction relations around an geographic object
starts by computing the minimum bounding rectangle
(mbr) for the object. The area next to the mbr with the
same size as the mbr is taken as the meaning of the spa-
tial relation. Since the resultant area is the same size as
the original object, this makes the meaning of cardinal di-
rections relative to the size of the reference object, taking
into account the fact that larger objects are visible from
farther away. Cardinal directions relative to point objects
are interpreted as a square, 500 meters on a side, lying in
the appropriate direction.
The observer or object oriented relations such as
Adjacent-to (&amp;quot;beside waterfall,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;on Kona-Hilo Hwy&amp;quot;),
Beyond (&amp;quot;1 1/2 mile beyond end of 20 Mile Road,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;at

side&amp;quot;) require understanding the orientation of the object
or observer. Currently in GR, only object-oriented rela-
tions are processed. Given an object with a front, back,
and sides (left and right), the corresponding relations are
Front-of, Beyond, and Adjacent-to (Left-of and Right-
of). These areas are calculated from the object&apos;s mbr in a
similar fashion to the cardinal direction relations.
The At-elevation relation with respect to a given al-
titude requires computing the subregion of the common
intersection area that is within 40 meters5 of the given
elevation. The At-elevation relation relative to an object
(e.g., &amp;quot;above Schofield&amp;quot;) requires computing the preva-
lent slope of the terrain around the object. OR takes a
200 meter square on the up/down side of the object.
Between, From, and Toward are handled by taking the
mbr of the two objects, then computing the two corner
points on each mbr that is furthest on either side from
the line connecting the centers of the mbrs. These four
points are then connected to form the area between the
two objects.
The Near relation is converted into a buffer zone
around the area. Currently OR uses a fixed distance
of 200 meters for simplicity, however further study is
needed to determine if this corresponds to most people&apos;s
interpretation. There may be individual, cultural, or re-
gional differences in interpretation. Also, the size of the
buffer zone may depend on the size of the geographic ob-
ject.
Currently GR does not handle references to terrain
type, wetness, or typical sun exposure because this type
of data is not available in the USGS databases. Refer-
ences to ordinal forks and branches are assumed to start
from the head of the rivers or valleys. Generic terms are
handled after processing all other spatial relations by ex-
haustively searching for any instances of the same type

Because collectors often collect specimens on trips (ei-
ther day hikes or multi-day camping expeditions), an
analysis of the path of the collectors should yield valu-
able information about the location of collection. Speci-
mens are typically labeled with the collection date and the
collector&apos;s accession number, which provides the relative
time of collection for specimens on that day. This infor-
mation can be used to disambiguate location descriptions
and to pinpoint vague locations. For example, in Hawaii,
there are not only two Waihee Streams, but also a Wai-
hee River. In a location description that mentions, &amp;quot;along
Waihee Stream,&amp;quot; there is ambiguity as to which of these
three waterways is actually meant. In the current version
of LEI, disambiguation is possible only if the description
contains more information that specifies an area that in-
tersects with only one of the three streams. By adding
reasoning about time using accession dates and numbers
and combining this with reasoning about paths, LEI could
determine that it is unlikely that the collector stopped col-
lecting specimens along one Waihee Stream, flew to an-
other island to collect a specimen along another Waihee
Stream, then flew back to continue collecting along the
first Waihee Stream.
This type of reasoning can also help to pinpoint
which part of Waihee Stream is meant by &amp;quot;along Wai-
hee Stream.&amp;quot; If LEI knows that the previous specimen
was collected at point A and the following specimen was
collected at point B, then LEI can make the reasonable
assumption that this specimen was collected somewhere
near the intersection of Waihee Stream and a region be-
tween points A and B. Using this type of reasoning, LEI
can even make a reasonable guess about the collection

numbers can be located). Adding such reasoning about
time and paths would improve the accuracy of LEI&apos;s pro-

6 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999979761904762">
The LEI system demonstrates the feasibility of under-
standing the sublanguage used in location descriptions
for biological specimens. Although this is an important
and valuable task in and of itself, there is a much greater
potential for application of the NLP and geographical
reasoning techniques demonstrated in LEI to other areas
such as natural language interfaces to general GISs (Geo-
graphic Information Systems). There is a need for valida-
tion of these techniques and a study is currently planned
to compare the results of LEI with results obtained man-
ually. Finally, the problems encountered in building LEI
point to several new directions. First, the GKB com-
ponent shows how object-oriented geographic databases
should be organized in the future. Second, many new
studies are required to determine the limits of fuzzy spa-
tial relations like North-of, Front-of, and Near. Such
studies should investigate task dependencies, context de-
pendencies, individual variances, and cultural/regional
variances. Such studies would lead to advances in under-
standing human cognition of spatial relations that would
be directly applicable in GISs like LEI.

<abstract confidence="0.998568964285714">Biological specimens have historically been labeled with English descriptions of the location of collection. To perform spatial, statistical, or historic studies, these descriptions must be converted into geodetic coordinates. A study of the sublanguage used in the descriptions shows much less frequent than typical usage of observer-relative relations such as &amp;quot;left of,&amp;quot; but shows problems with name ambiguity, finding the referents of generic terms like &amp;quot;the stream,&amp;quot; ordinal numbering of river forks and valley branches, object-oriented prepositions (&amp;quot;behind&amp;quot;), fuzzy boundaries (how close is &amp;quot;at,&amp;quot; how far is still &amp;quot;north of&apos;), etc. The LEI system implements a semi-automated understanding of such location descriptions. Components of LEI include a language analyzer, a geographical reasoner, an object-oriented geographic knowledge base derived from US Geological Survey digital maps with user input, and a graphical user interface. LEI parses prepositional phrases into spatial relations, converts these into areas, then computes polygon overlays to find the intersection, and returns the minimum bounding rectangle. The user is consulted on unknown words/phrases and ambiguous descriptions.</abstract>
