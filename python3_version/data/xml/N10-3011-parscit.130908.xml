This paper describes an experiment designed
to evaluate the development of a Statistical
Transfer-based Brazilian Portuguese to Eng-
lish Machine Translation system. We compare
the performance of the system with the inclu-
sion of new syntactic written rules concerning
verbal tense between the Brazilian Portuguese
and English languages. Results indicate that
the system performance improved compared
with an initial version of the system. However
significant adjustments remain to be done.

<bodyText confidence="0.998383083333333">
Recently, Statistical Machine Translation systems
have received much attention because they are
fully automated and have shown significant im-
provements over other types of approaches. Ex-
periments with string-to-string and syntax-based
systems have shown better results when linguistic
features are added to Machine Translation systems
(Chiang et al., 2009). The Statistical Transfer
(Stat-XFER) approach presented in this paper was
designed as a Statistical approach with a grammar
module, which encodes syntactic transfer rules,
i.e., rules which encode constituent structures from
the source language to the target language struc-
ture.
Verbal tenses vary among natural languages.
Each language has its typical verbal form, and they
share mood, voice, aspect and person qualities
(Comrie, 1993). Some languages, such as Portu-
guese and English do not share the same properties
and the number of verbal tenses may present di-
vergences. Our goal is to test the development of
the Statistical Transfer-based system under the
application of syntactic transfer rules of verbal
tenses involving this pair of languages.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999388909090909">
The hybrid Stat-XFER system uses a transfer-
based method and statistical paradigm for the
translation process and it is composed of the fol-
lowing main components: the Bilingual Phrasal
Lexicon, Morphology, Transfer Engine and the
Decoder. Given one sentence in the source lan-
guage, this input will go through all those compo-
nents until the system outputs a set of pairs
mapping candidate translations to probabilities.
The Stat-XFER framework is shown in the figure 1
below.

Bilingual Phrasal Lexicon. The Portuguese-
English lexicon is made up of a word-level lexi-
con. The lexicon was automatically extracted from
the EUROPARL corpus1 and in order to adjust it
to this system’s needs, this lexicon has been modi-
fied with new entries and deleted of the repeated
entries.
Morphology. The system uses the Jspell2 mor-
phology analyzer, which was developed by the
Minho University in Portugal. Jspell produces all
possible labels for a lexical entry in the input and it
provides a stem for each word with a different la-
bel. Upon each sentence in the lexicon input, the
Morphology Analyzer examines each lexical entry
and performs its analysis.
Transfer Engine. This component was devel-
oped by the AVENUE group from Carnegie Mel-
lon University (Probst et al., 2002, Lavie et al.,
2003, Lavie et al., 2004, Lavie 2008) and applies
the lexical transfer rules specified by the Lexicon
component, i.e. the lexical entries in Portuguese
are substituted by their translations in English.
This component also applies the transfer grammar
rules from Portuguese into English producing con-
stituents translated into the English structure.
When the transfer stage has completed, we have a
chart (hypergraph) in which each key contains an
n-best beam for each non-terminal type of each
source span. Each entry in the beam has a unifica-
tion feature structure and log-linear feature scores
associated with it.
Before decoding, the chart is turned into a lattice
by removing hierarchical structure and respecting
only the target-side ordering of the constituents
produced by the grammar. The unification features
and unification constraints on each rule can re-
move ungrammatical hypotheses from the search
space.
Decoder. For each sentence, the Decoder does a
monotonic left-to-right decoding on the Transla-
tion Lattice with no reordering beyond what the
grammar produced. For each source span, the de-
coder keeps the n most likely hypotheses.

According to Ma and McKeown (2009), in transla-
tions the main verb of a sentence is the most im-
portant element for the sentence comprehension. In
Machine Translation, the goal is to produce under-
standable translations. Therefore, we started our
experiment by adjusting the verbal tense rules be-
tween the Brazilian Portuguese and English.
Natural languages do not share the same prop-
erties concerning verbs. The pair of languages Por-
tuguese and English for example, has different
systems of modality. According to Palmer (1986),
the English language has its system of modal verbs
defined by can, could, will, would, may, must,
might, ought, shall, should, need and dare. How-
ever, the Portuguese language has a system of
mood consisting of indicative and subjunctive
moods (Bechara, 2002).
Moreover, the Brazilian Portuguese and the
English languages present morphological differ-
ences between verbal forms. For example, many
verbs in English have the following form: Base +
{-s form (3rd person singular present)/PAST/-ing/-
ed} (Quirk and Greenbaum, 1973). Nonetheless, in
Brazilian Portuguese the verbs present the follow-
ing form in most case: Base + thematic vowel +
number/person agreement + tense/mood agree-
ment. This verbal form is present in every tense in
the indicative and subjunctive moods.
In order not to lose any information concerning
the distinction between verbal tenses from Brazil-
ian Portuguese to English, we built a corpus with
sentences in all verbal tenses in Portuguese (Be-
chara, 2002) and manually mapped them into
English. Each Portuguese verbal form was mapped
into English in all their conceivable translations.
This corpus is a sentence-level parallel corpus with
original sentences in the Portuguese language and
their respective translations. The main goal of
building this corpus was to verify all possible
translations between Portuguese and English ver-
bal tenses.

3.1 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804833333333">
Since this was a pilot experiment, we were inter-
ested in verifying if our changes improved the sys-
tem. This pilot experiment consists of translating a
corpus containing all three verb conjugation
classes in Portuguese: 1) First conjugation class:
verbs ending in –AR; 2) Second conjugation class:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993335">
59
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983770833333">
verbs which end in –ER; and 3) Third Conjugation
class: verbs ending in –IR, respecting each tense,
mood and number in Stat-XFER system and then
evaluating their results.
To construct the three corpora – one corpus for
each conjugation class – we extracted the 100 most
frequent Portuguese verbs appearing in Google’s
search engine3 in all three conjugation classes in
Portuguese. The search for the most frequent Por-
tuguese verbs was done using a tool developed in
Python and followed the following constrains: a) a
result had to be an infinitive verb; b) had to be in
the Portuguese language and c) had to be found in
a Brazilian Web page.
From the one hundred most frequent Portu-
guese verbs in each conjugation class we manually
built three corpora of all three verb conjugation
classes in Portuguese, respecting each tense, mood,
number, and person, and then a human translator
mapped them into English through manual transla-
tion. Each corpus contains no more than three ex-
amples of each most frequent verb selected,
resulting in 163 sentences.
Once all verbal tenses were translated into Eng-
lish, we applied these three corpora to the Stat-
XFER system and evaluated all resulting transla-
tions using Meteor. Meteor is a metric for the eval-
uation of Machine Translation output. The metric
is based on the harmonic mean of unigram preci-
sion and recall (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007). The
Meteor scores are in a scale from 0 to 1, where 0
means the translation is the farthest from the ref-
erence translation and 1 means the translation is
most similar to a human translation.
After the evaluation, we initiated the improve-
ment of the grammar module with new syntactic
transfer rules in order to deal with the problems
presented by the differences between the verbal
tenses. The transfer rules were manually developed
and encoded how constituent structures in the
source language transfer to the target language. In
the beginning of our research, the system had 113
such rules in its grammar, but with some modifica-
tions the system now has 152 rules concerning the
mapping from Portuguese to English. We add a
rule for each tense in each conjugation class. Few
rules address more than one tense. A Stat-XFER
syntactic rule example is shown below.

The first line is the name of rule, in this case
VP, 2. The second and third lines are examples of
transference between both languages, which means
a source language (SL) will be encoded into a re-
spective target language (TL). The forth line indi-
cates that a simple verb in SL will be translated as
a simple verb in TL as well.
The condition of application of that rules is be-
tween parenthesis, shown in the fifth and twelfth
lines. In line six, inside these parentheses, it is
indicated that the first element of the verbal phrase
from source language, i.e. X1, will be converted as
the first element of the verbal phrase in the target
language, i.e. Y1. Line seven says that X1 must be
in the present tense and line eight says it must not
be a subjunctive mood. Line nine states that Y1
must be in the present tense. Lines ten and eleven
indicate that X1 will receive the number and per-
son from an element in the source language, X0 in
this case.
Another significant modification concerns the
Bilingual phrasal lexicon. In the beginning of our
research, the system had 56.665 entries with their
respective translations. However, many of these
lexical items presented improper translations, repe-
titions and lack of correct meanings. To help im-
prove the development of our system some
modifications in this lexicon were required. This
word level lexicon is in constant modification with
the inclusion of missing lexicon items, cleaning of
repeated items and correction of the inappropriate
ones. The Stat-XFER word-level lexicon has now
57.315 entries with their respective translations.

Interesting results were collected in this experi-
ment. The new results show improvements in cor-
relation with translation references on the second
and third conjugations (Table 1). The system
modifications we have done so far yielded some
improvements. The inclusion and correction of
syntactic rules according to the differences be-
tween linguistic parameters of the languages is the
natural way to improve the results of Meteor eval-
uation in Stat-XFER system.
However, it is also noticeable that in the first con-
jugation we observed a decline in the performance
of the system. This was one of the interesting ob-
servations we made based on this study.
To better study the effect of the inclusion of
new grammar rules between verbal tenses, we per-
form a second evaluation of our system, now using
a previously unseen corpus. This new corpus was
build from FAPESP Magazine4, which is a bilin-
gual online publication designed for the Brazilian
scientific community. We extracted 415 sentences
from the Humanities section and translated them
with the old and new syntactic rules to evaluate the
performance of the system. The comparative re-
sults of these two evaluations are shown in Table 2
below.

The two evaluations of the FAPESP Magazine
corpus indicate that the insertion of new grammar
rules presents significant improvement compared
to the system in its initial state. It is important to
note that these results validate our experiment and
confirm the improvement of the system. We dis-
cuss our results in Section 4.

<bodyText confidence="0.999549666666667">
An interesting observation is that in the corpus
manually built for the experiment, the score of the
first conjugation decreased (Table 1), while we
expected that it should increase. We were surprised
by this phenomenon and started investigating its
causes. After preliminary studies, we now believe
that this is due to a greater number of possible
meanings that verbs from the first conjugation in
Portuguese can assume, thus producing several
translations in English, with smaller a correlation
with respective human reference translations.
According to Williams (1962), the endings of
infinitive verbs in Portuguese are derived from
Classical Latin. The first conjugation in Brazilian
Portuguese also contains verbs borrowed from dif-

ferent languages, e.g. the English verb to delete
has its correspondent deletar in Portuguese.
Moreover, the creation of new verbs in Portuguese
is always included in the first conjugation, sharing
a common set of characteristic of verbs ended in –
AR. While the second and third conjugation
classes tend to have a finite number of verbs given
from Classical Latin, the first conjugation class is
still increasing, unlike the second and third conju-
gations. These changes in verbs from the first
conjugation classes may impact the development
and evaluation of the system.
Note that the corpora used to evaluate our sys-
tem are very small compared to corpora recom-
mend for Machine Translation evaluations. Since
this was a pilot experiment, we were only inter-
ested in verifying if the questions we wanted to ask
were answerable. Further validation will be per-
formed once more rules are added to the system
and new human translations are included in the
reference corpus.
Lavie et al. (2004) applied a transfer-rule learn-
ing approach to this system in order to learn auto-
matically the transfer rules from Hebrew to
English. We believe that this approach can be ap-
plied to the Portuguese-to-English system and it
can improve the coverage of grammar rules.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962">
The results of our experiment are very promising.
We could observe a clear improvement in the per-
formance of the system after syntactic rules were
added to its grammar module. The new syntactic
rules concerning the verbal tenses improved sys-
tem performance, but also indicated that there is
significant room for improvements in the Stat-
XFER system. In particular, improving the transfer
rules in other aspects beyond the Verbal tense is a
promising area of future research.
Although this research is in a preliminary stage,
we already made interesting linguistic observations
about Portuguese verbs from first conjugation con-
cerning the development of Machine Translation
systems. We believe this is a general issue that
should concern every designer of Machine Trans-
lation system of the Brazilian Portuguese lan-
guage. We are very excited about the future stages
of this study, and its potential contribution to the
linguistic perspective of the field of Machine
Translation.

These changes in verbs from the first conjugation classes may impact the development and evaluation of the system. Note that the corpora used to evaluate our system are very small compared to corpora recommend for Machine Translation evaluations. Since this was a pilot experiment, we were only interested in verifying if the questions we wanted to ask were answerable. Further validation will be performed once more rules are added to the system and new human translations are included in the reference corpus. Lavie et al. (2004) applied a transfer-rule learning approach to this system in order to learn automatically the transfer rules from Hebrew to English. We believe that this approach can be applied to the Portuguese-to-English system and it can improve the coverage of grammar rules. 5 Conclusion The results of our experiment are very promising. We could observe a clear improvement in the performance of the system after syntactic rules were added to its grammar module. The new syntactic rules concerning the verbal tenses improved system performance, but also indicated that there is significant room for improvement</context>

Each corpus contains no more than three examples of each most frequent verb selected, resulting in 163 sentences. Once all verbal tenses were translated into English, we applied these three corpora to the StatXFER system and evaluated all resulting translations using Meteor. Meteor is a metric for the evaluation of Machine Translation output. The metric is based on the harmonic mean of unigram precision and recall (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007). The Meteor scores are in a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means the translation is the farthest from the reference translation and 1 means the translation is most similar to a human translation. After the evaluation, we initiated the improvement of the grammar module with new syntactic transfer rules in order to deal with the problems presented by the differences between the verbal tenses. The transfer rules were manually developed and encoded how constituent structures in the source language transfer to the target language.

In Machine Translation, the goal is to produce understandable translations. Therefore, we started our experiment by adjusting the verbal tense rules between the Brazilian Portuguese and English. Natural languages do not share the same properties concerning verbs. The pair of languages Portuguese and English for example, has different systems of modality. According to Palmer (1986), the English language has its system of modal verbs defined by can, could, will, would, may, must, might, ought, shall, should, need and dare. However, the Portuguese language has a system of mood consisting of indicative and subjunctive moods (Bechara, 2002). Moreover, the Brazilian Portuguese and the English languages present morphological differences between verbal forms. For example, many verbs in English have the following form: Base + {-s form (3rd person singular present)/PAST/-ing/- ed} (Quirk and Greenbaum, 1973).

We were surprised by this phenomenon and started investigating its causes. After preliminary studies, we now believe that this is due to a greater number of possible meanings that verbs from the first conjugation in Portuguese can assume, thus producing several translations in English, with smaller a correlation with respective human reference translations. According to Williams (1962), the endings of infinitive verbs in Portuguese are derived from Classical Latin. The first conjugation in Brazilian Portuguese also contains verbs borrowed from dif4 http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br 61 ferent languages, e.g. the English verb to delete has its correspondent deletar in Portuguese. Moreover, the creation of new verbs in Portuguese is always included in the first conjugation, sharing a common set of characteristic of verbs ended in – AR.
