<bodyText confidence="0.972578125">
Scrambling, both local and long-distance, has recently
attracted considerable attention among linguists and
computational linguists. In this paper, we will ex-
plore the adequacy of the Tree Adjoining Gram-
mar (TAG) formalism for dealing with long-distance
scrambling&apos; in German. We will show that TAGs
cannot capture the full range of constructions derived
by scrambling. However, Multi-Component TAGs
(MC-TAG), an extension of TAGs introduced earlier
[Joshi 1987a, Weir 19881 and utilized for linguistic pur-
poses (e.g. for extraposition [Kroch and Joshi 1986]),
can indeed capture the full range of constructions de-
rived by scrambling. We will also present an ID/LP
variant of TAG to capture the same constructions, and
then comment on the relationship between the two sys-
tems.

In German (and in many other SOV languages, such
as Korean, Hindi and Japanese), a constituent of an
embedded clause may be moved from that clause into
the matrix clause. Consider, for example, sentences (1)
in Figure 1. In German, the object of the embedded
clause can be &amp;quot;moved&amp;quot;&apos; to any position in the matrix
clause, as in sentences (lb) and (lc).

&apos;Intra-clausal scrambling and string-vacuous scrambling will
not be discussed in this paper, since they do not pose any par-
ticular problem for the TAG formalism.

fact, analyses have been proposed (going back to (Evers 1975j)

based on â€¢ process of &amp;quot;verb cluster formation&amp;quot;, which avoid
inter-clausal movement altogether. However, since embedding
is recursive, the verb clusters cannot all be listed in the lexicon.
Hence, from a formal point of view, a lexical or morphological
analysis of verb cluster formation poses exactly the sante prob-
lems as scrambling interpreted as syntactic movement.
A striking feature of scrambling is its freedom: there
appear to be no systematic syntactic restrictions on
the number of verbal arguments that undergo &amp;quot;move-
ment,&amp;quot; nor on the distances over which they may
move. Thus, any ordering of the arguments from all
clauses is possible. To illustrate this freedom we will
present two additional examples in which scrambling
of a more complex nature occurs.

3 A TAG Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939636363636">
The TAG formalism (for a recent introduction, see
[Joshi 1987a]) is well suited for linguistic description
because (1) it provides a larger domain of locality than
a CFG or other augmented CFG-based formalisms
such as IIPSG or LFG, and (2) it allows factoring of
recursion from the domain of dependencies. This ex-
tended domain of locality, provided by the elementary
trees of TAG, allows us to &amp;quot;lexicalize&amp;quot; a TAG gram-
mar: we can associate each tree in a grammar with a
lexical item [Schabes et al 1988, Schabes 1990]. The
tree will contain the lexical item, and all of its syntac-

3Some verbs allow scrambling out of their complements
more freely than others. It appears that all subject-control
verbs and most object-control verbs governing the dative al-
low scrambling fairly freely, while scrambling with object-
control verbs governing the accusative is more restricted (cf.
[Bayer and Komfilt 19891). From a formal point of view, these
restrictions are not relevant for the present argument.
4 The associated lexical item is called the anchor, and is either
the head or the functional head of the tree.

tic dependents. As has been shown previously, certain
long-distance phenomena such as topicalization and
wh-movement can be handled naturally within TAG
[Kroch and Joshi 1985]. Here, &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot; means that
dependencies are stated within the larger domain of lo-
cality (the elementary tree), i.e., each clausal tree still
contains a verb and all of its arguments. Thus, in a
lexicalized TAG, the effects of long-distance movement
are achieved by adjunction. The word order freedom
possible in the context of unconstrained scrambling,
however, eludes the scope of TAGs. In this section, we
will informally argue this formal result.
By an argument very similar to Shieber&apos;s argument
for Swiss German [Shieber 1985], it can be shown that
the string language of scrambled High German is not
a context-free language. However, the linguistic facts
of German do not allow an extension of the argu-
ment: we cannot show that the string language is not
a Tree Adjoining Language. From a linguistic perspec-
tive, the existence of some grammar that generates the
string language of German scrambling is not in itself
of much interest. For example, if we define a TAG
grammar that generates the strings of scrambled Ger-
man in which, however, some trees pair a verb with
the arguments of some other verb, then we have not
adequately described the linguistic facts. We are really
only interested in linguistically motivated grammars,
namely those that exploit the extended domain of lo-
cality and whose trees obey the constraint of contain-
ing a lexical item and all of its syntactic dependents
(and nothing else). We will refer to such restrictions
as &amp;quot;co-occurrence constraints&amp;quot;. We can show that no
TAG meeting the co-occurrence constraints can gener-
ate the sentences of German scrambling. We will argue
this point in two complementary ways. First, we will
consider the case of clauses with two overt nominal ar-
guments. Then, ive will consider the case of clauses
with one overt nominal argument.
In the first case, the verb of the embedded clause
subcategorizes for three NPs, one of which is an
empty subject (PRO). There is no verb in Ger-
man that subcategorizes for three NPs and an
S, so in this case a recursively embedded struc-
ture is impossible, and we have only one level
of embedding. We show that the language
{a(NP1 , NP?, NP, NP) V2 VI I a a permutation}
- 22 -
cannot be generated by a TAG that contains only ele-
mentary trees obeying the co-occurrence restraints. A
linguistically plausible set of two such trees is shown in
Figure 2. Consider the string NP? NP,&apos; NP1 NP? V2 Vi,
which corresponds to the ordering in sentence (213). It
can easily be seen that this string cannot be generated
by a TAG of the specified sort: after an adjunction the
yield of the adjoined tree is segmented into at most two
sections, while the yield of both trees would need to be
segmented into three sections in order to be composed
into the desired string.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.978706">
Figure 2: Initial trees with two verbal arguments
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.995231306451613">
In the second case, the verbs of the embedded clauses
subcategorize for two NPs, one of which is again an
empty subject (PRO), and an S. We will argue that
the language {a-(NP1, , NPOI/k . . . V1 IkEN and er
a permutation) cannot be generated by a TAG which
obeys the co-occurrence constraints, i.e., whose ele-
mentary trees have only two (non-vacuous) terminal
leaves, NPi and 3/45. The idea in selecting this lan-
guage is as follows: we keep the verbs at the end in
the inverted order required by embedding, and then
consider all possible permutations of the NPs. For
k &lt; 4 TAGs that generate the possible permuta-
tions can be constructed; for k = 4 the construc-
tion is not obvious, but we will not give the details
here. However, for k = 5 it is impossible. Con-
sider the string w = NP3NPI NP5 NP2 NP4 V5 V4 V3 V2 V1.
For this string, it can be shown that it is impossible
to construct a TAG which meets the co-occurrence
constraints discussed above and that generates the
string. The proof is fairly involved; for details, see
[Becker and Rambow 1990].
In deciding whether scrambling as a linguistic phe-
nomenon can adequately be described by a TAG or
a TAG-equivalent formalism, it is crucial to decide
5Note that the indices are not actually part of the alpha-
bet over which we have defined the language, which is siineb,
(NP, V). The indices only serve the purpose of indicating which
ten ll i ll als are supposed to be contributed by which tree, exploit-
ing the co-occurrence constraints.
whether or not sentences corresponding to the strings
given above are indeed grammatical. In the case of the
embedded two-argument clauses, examples are readily
available, as in sentences (2a) and (2b). In the case of
the embedded one-argument sentences, it is more diffi-
cult (but not impossible) to construct an adequate ex-
ample because of the great depth of embedding. How-
ever, one might argue that there is a limit on the num-
ber of clauses over which a scrambled NP may move.
If this were true, the number of resulting structures
would be finite, so that they could be handled triv-
ially by simple formalisms. Sentences (3a) and (3b)
show scrambled NPs can move over two clauses, and
we know of no evidence that convincingly establishes
such a limit for higher numbers. The reluctance that
some native speakers show to accept the more com-
plex sentences is due mainly to processing difficulties,
rather than to the ungrammaticality of the sentences.
A similar phenomenon occurs when native speakers re-
ject multiply center-embedded sentences as &amp;quot;ungram-
matical&amp;quot;.
In summary, long-distance scrambling provides lin-
guistic evidence that shows that scrambling is beyond
the formal generative capacity of TAGs. In the next
two sections, we will investigate two ways of extending
the TAG formalism in order to achieve the necessary
power. In the first approach, we will relax the imme-
diate dominance relation of the elementary trees. In
the second approach, we will relax the linear prece-
dence relations of the elementary trees. In both cases,
our concern will be to preserve the key properties of
TAGs, namely their extended domain of locality, and
the factoring of recursion from dependencies.

4 A Multi-Component TAG

One approach is to relax the ID (Immediate Domi-
nance) relation within one elementary tree. Even in
a standard TAG, the ID relation between a mother
and a daughter node is not necessarily an immediate
dominance relation because of the possibility of ad-
joining another tree at the daughter node. We pro-
pose to relax some of the ID relations of the auxiliary
tree when it is adjoined. This can be seen as splitting
up the auxiliary tree into parts, while still keeping a
dominance constraint between the parts. As we will
show, such a splitting of the elementary trees, interest-
ingly, leads to a previously defined extension of TAGs:
namely, that of Multi-Component TAGs (MC-TAG)

As shown in Section 3, a TAG meeting the
co-occurrence constraints cannot derive the string
NPPIP11 NP1 NP?V2Vi. It is obvious that in order
to get this variation from the trees in Figure 2, the
yield of the adjoined tree has to be broken up into
three segments, which means that ig has to be broken
up into two parts that are then adjoined to different
nodes of a. This is exactly what relaxation of the ID
relation can achieve. If the tree 13 in Figure 2 is split
at the interior S node, i.e. by relaxing the ID relation
between the two S nodes, we can construct a pair of
auxiliary trees as shown in Figure 3, where the dashed
line indicates a dominance relation.

Sets of trees are exactly what the MC-TAG formal-
ism introduces. In an MC-TAG, instead of auxiliary
trees being single trees we have auxiliary sets, a set
containing more than one (but still a fixed number)
6MC-TAGs have already been â€¢ used by Kroch and Joshi
1Kroch and Joshi 1986] for the analysis of extraposition. It is
interesting to note that the additional requirement that the foot

root node of the other component in the same auxiliary set was
also used by them.
of auxiliary trees. For details of the definition of MC-
TAG see [Joshi 1987a, Weir 1988]. In an MC-TAG,
adjunction is defined as the simultaneous adjunction
of all trees in a set to different nodes. It is not possi-
ble to adjoin trees from the same set into each other.
Thus, we can interpret TAGS with relaxed dominance
as MC-TAGs, by identifying subtrees containing only
ID relations with trees in an MC-TAG tree set. How-
ever, we need to introduce an additional constraint:
the foot node of the first tree (th) in the tree set of
Figure 3 has to dominate the root node of the second
tree (f32) after adjoining the tree set. This is indicated
by the dashed link between the foot node of /31 and
the root node of 132. For example, Figure 4 shows the
effect of adjoining the tree set of Figure 3 into tree
a of Figure 2, which yields the ordering of scrambled
sentence (2b), NP11 NP1 NP? V2 V1.7
In defining adjunction for MC-TAGs, an issue arises
that is irrelevant in the case of simple TAGs: do
we restrict adjunction in such a way that members
of a tree set must be adjoined into the trees of an
elementary tree set, or do we allow adjunction into
derived tree sets as well? With the restricted defini-
tion of adjunction (called &amp;quot;local MC-TAG&amp;quot;), MC-TAG
has been shown to have a slightly greater generative
power than TAG; however, local MC-TAGs still be-
long to the class of Mildly Context Sensitive Gram-
mar formalisms (MCSG). Weir [Weir 1988] has also
shown that MC-TAGs are equivalent to the Linear
Context Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS), which are
the best known characterization of the MCSG formal-
ism (though they are not an exhaustive characteriza-
tion of MCSG). In particular, we know that local MC-
TAGs are polynomially parsable. However, it can be
shown that local MC-TAGs are not adequate for de-
riving all possible scrambled sentences in German (for
a detailed discussion, see [Becker and Rambow 1990]).
In fact, no LCFRS is powerful enough to capture
scrambling. It is obvious that MC-TAG with the more
liberal definition of adjunction (called &amp;quot;nonlocal MC-
TAG&amp;quot;) can produce all the possible versions of scram-
bled embedded sentences for any level of embedding.
However, nonlocal MC-TAG has not yet been stud-
ied in detail, and it is currently not known whether
nonlocal MC-TAGs are polynomially parsable.
7This particular example can be derived with a weaker for-
malism; the point of the example is merely to illustrate the
proposed formalism. It can easily be seen how it can handle
scrambling from arbitrary levels of embedding.

5 A Free-Order Approach: Re-
laxed LP
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853333333334">
An alternative formalism, which we will call FO-TAG
(Free Order TAG), is closely based on the LD/LP-
TAG framework presented in [Joshi 19874 As does
an LD/LP-TAG grammar, a FO-TAG grammar con-
sists of a set of elementary structures. Each elemen-
tary structure is a pair consisting of one linear dom-
inance (LD) structure (i.e., an unordered tree) and
corresponding LP rules. The LD structure (which will,
imprecisely, be referred to as a &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot; in this paper) is
either an initial or an auxiliary structure. The LP rules
may relate any two nodes of the tree unless one linearly
dominates the other. However, these precedence rules
can only be stated with respect to the nodes of an
elementary tree; it is impossible to relate nodes in dif-
ferent trees. When an auxiliary tree fi is adjoined into
an initial tree a, the nodes of # are not ordered with
respect to the nodes of a. However, even in languages
with relatively free word order there are restrictions on
movement. In order to capture these, we introduce two
linguistically motivated constraints, the integrity con-
straint and the inheritance constraint. The integrity
constraint, written i, allows us to express the fact
that German does not allow scrambling into or out
of certain constituents, such as NPs and CPs (tensed
clauses). If we have X for some node X, then any
node which is not in the subtree rooted at X and which
does not dominate X must either precede or follow ev-
ery node in the subtree rooted in X. The inheritance
constraint, written $, forces inheritance and allows us
to capture the clause-final position of the verb in Ger-
man. If we have $X for a node X, then when the tree
of which X is a node is adjoined into another tree at
node A, X inherits all LP rules specified for A.
As an example, consider sentences (2a) and (2b) given
in Section 2. The initial trees along with the LP rules
and constraints are shown in Figure 5. Adjunction
yields the structure shown in Figure 6. Note that only
one of the possible orderings of the nodes, correspond-
ing to sentence (2b), is shown.

immediately obvious that FO-TAG is not an LCFRS;
the question of polynomial parsability remains open,
as does the question of the generative power of FO-
TAG. We are currently investigating these issues.
From a linguistic point of view, it is interesting that
the same linguistic phenomenon can be handled by
two very different formalisms. Scrambling is currently
attracting much attention from syntacticians working
in the GB framework. One question as yet unresolved
is whether clause-internal scrambling is the same type
of syntactic movement as long-distance scrambling. In
FO-TAG, both types of movement are created by the
same formal device, namely the underspecification of
LP rules. In the case of MC-TAG, only long-distance
scrambling can be simulated by multicomponent ad-
junction; clause-internal scrambling must be handled
by some other means (such as metarules, which func-
tion as an abbreviatory device for listing a finite set of
elementary trees), since it is impossible to adjoin one
tree into another tree of the same tree set. There are
several other syntactic issues which are currently being
debated in the linguistic literature, and for which the
two formalisms make different predictions. For details,
see [Rambow and Becker 1990].

is similar to the approach proposed in section 4. They
also make use of a splitting of the auxiliary tree #
of figure 2, though they split the elementary tree into
different tree sets. In particular, the verb and its argu-
ments are no longer contained within the same domain

Their approach is essentially motivated by linguistic
considerations; however, it is easy to show that their
analysis can be expressed in our proposed variant of
MC-TAG, thus supporting our purely formal analy-

The proposed FO-TAG formalism is close in spirit to
GPSG, in that ID and LP relations are stated sepa-

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975235294118">
We have shown that long-distance scrambling, a syn-
tactic phenomenon exhibited by German and some
other languages, cannot be adequately described with
a TAG. We have proposed two more powerful exten-
sions of TAG: a variant of the well-studied MC-TAG,
and a TAG formalism with free node order, FO-TAG.
We have shown that both are descriptively adequate.
The linguistic descriptions that these formalisms give
rise to, however, are quite different, and they make
different predictions about the nature of long-distance
scrambling.
Some key formal properties of the two formalisms are
still under investigation, in particular the issues of
polynomial parsability and generative power. We con-
jecture that FO-TAG and MC-TAG with dominance
links (or some slight definitional variants of the two
systems) are weakly equivalent to each other.
