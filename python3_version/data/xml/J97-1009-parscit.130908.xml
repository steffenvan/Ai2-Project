COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE is a leading international
journal designed to promote and stimulate research in
the field of artificial intelligence. Articles cover a wide
range of Al issues—from the tools and languages of Al
to its philosophical implications. Appealing to readers
in research and industry, COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
provides a forum for experimental and theoretical
research, surveys, and impact studies.

HANDBOOK OF LOGIC
&apos;AND LANGUAGE
edited by
Johan F. A. K. van Benthem
and Alice G. B. ter Meulen
The first comprehensive handbook for
the combined study of logic and
language. The twenty chapters show both
sides of the interaction between logic
and language: how logical systems are
designed and modified in response to
linguistic needs, and how mathematical
theory arises out of this process and
affects subsequent linguistic theory.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993658">
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer-
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words.
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact the editor regarding the possibility of electronic
submission.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.848187">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978196470588235">
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com-
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to forty
double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully refereed,
being read by at least two members of the editorial board and usually by an additional expert
in the particular subject area. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the
author certifies the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for
publication to another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear,
in a non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Edi-
tor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication
must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the
case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978
U.S. Copyright law.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of .opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982. Besides publishing Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings
(annually in North America, biennially in Europe) where the state-of-the-art in natural language
processing research and development is presented. Recently, special interest groups on the Mathematics of
Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, and Multimedia Language
Processing have been formed; others are likely to be added.
