We describe our linguistic rule-based tag-
ger IceTagger, and compare its tagging ac-
curacy to the TnT tagger, a state-of-the-
art statistical tagger, when tagging Ice-
landic, a morphologically complex lan-
guage. Evaluation shows that the average
tagging accuracy is 91.54% and 90.44%,
obtained by IceTagger and TnT, respec-
tively. When tag profile gaps in the lex-
icon, used by the TnT tagger, are filled
with tags produced by our morphological
analyser IceMorphy, TnT’s tagging accu-

In this paper, we use a linguistic rule-based method
(LRBM) and a data-driven method (DDM) for tagg-
ing text in the morphologically complex Icelandic
language.
We present a novel LRBM. The tagger based on
this method, hereafter called IceTagger, uses about
175 local rules for initial disambiguation, and a set
of heuristics, to force feature agreement where ap-
propriate, for further disambiguation.
The average tagging accuracy of IceTagger is
91.54%, compared to 90.44% achieved by the TnT
tagger, a state-of-the-art statistical tagger (Brants,
2000). IceTagger makes 11.5% less errors than TnT.

IceMorphy, our morphological analyser, TnT’s tagg-

Tagger makes 4.1% less errors than TnT.
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-

methods in more detail. Sect. 3 briefly describes the
Icelandic language and the tagset. The components
of IceTagger are described in Sect. 4, and evaluation

DDMs use machine learning to automatically derive
a language model from, usually, hand-annotated cor-
pora. An advantage of the DDMs is their language
and tagset independence property. Their disadvan-
tage is that a tagged corpus is essential for training.
Furthermore, the limited window size used for dis-
ambiguation (e.g. three words) can be responsible
for some of the tagging errors.
One of the better known statistical data-driven
tagger is the TnT tagger (written in C). The tag-
ger uses a second order (trigram) Hidden Markov
model. The probabilities of the model are esti-
mated from a training corpus using maximum like-
lihood estimation. New assignments of part-of-
speech (POS) to words is found by optimising the
product of lexical probabilities (p(wi|tj)) and con-
textual probabilities (p(ti|ti−1, ti−2)) (where wi and
ti are the ith word and tag, respectively).
In contrast to DDMs, LRBMs are developed with
the purpose of tagging a specific language using a
particular tagset. The purpose of the rules is, usu-
ally, to remove illegitimate tags from words based on
context. The advantage of LRBMs is that they do not

rely (to the same extent as DDMs) on the existence
of a tagged corpus, and rules can be written to refer
to words and tags in the entire sentence. The con-
struction of a linguistic rule-based tagger, however,
has been considered a difficult and time-consuming
task (Voutilainen, 1995).
One of the better known LRBMs is the Con-
straint Grammar (CG) framework (Karlsson et al.,
1995), in which both POS and grammatical func-
tions are tagged. The EngCG-2 tagger, developed
over several years and consisting of 3,600 rules, has
been shown to obtain high accuracy (Samuelsson
and Voutilainen, 1997).
The development time of our LRBM (written in
Java; including a tokeniser, IceMorphy and Ice-
Tagger) was 7 man-months, which can be consid-
ered a short development time for a LRBM. This is
mainly due to the emphasis on using heuristics (see
Sect. 4.3) for disambiguation, as opposed to writing
a large number of local rules.

3 The Icelandic language and its tagset
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968789473684">
The Icelandic language is one of the Nordic lan-
guages. The language is morphologically rich,
mainly due to inflectional complexity. A thorough
description of the language can, for example, be
found in (Þráinsson, 1994).
The main Icelandic tagset, constructed in the
compilation of the tagged corpus Icelandic Fre-
quency Dictionary (IFD) (Pind et al., 1991), is large
(about 660 tags) compared to related languages. In
this tagset, each character in a tag has a particular
function. Table 1 shows the semantics of the noun
and the adjective tags.
To illustrate, consider the phrase “fallegu hes-
tarnir” (beautiful horses). The corresponding tag
for “fallegu” is “lkfnvf”, denoting adjective, mascu-
line, plural, nominative, weak declension, positive;
and the tag for “hestarnir” is “nkfng” denoting noun,
masculine, plural, nominative with suffixed definite
article.

4.1 The unknown word guesser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976730769231">
The purpose of our morphological analyser Ice-
Morphy, which is used as an unknown word guesser
by IceTagger, is to generate all appropriate tags
for a given word. It uses a familiar approach to
unknown word guessing, i.e. it performs mor-
phological/compound analysis and ending analysis
(Mikheev, 1997; Nakov et al., 2003). Additionally,
IceMorphy includes an important module for handl-
ing tag profile gaps (for a thorough description of
IceMorphy, consult (Loftsson, 2006a)).
A tag profile gap arises when a particular word,
listed in a lexicon derived from a corpus, has some
missing tags in its tag profile (set of possible tags).
The missing tag(s) might just not have been encoun-
tered during the derivation of the lexicon (e.g. dur-
ing training). For each noun, adjective or verb, of a
particular morphological class, IceMorphy is able to
fill in the gaps for the given word.
To illustrate, consider the word “konu” (woman),
and let us assume that only the tag “nveo” (denoting
noun, feminine, singular, accusative) is found in the
lexicon. Based on the “u” morphological suffix and
the accusative case of the tag, IceMorphy assumes
the word belongs to a particular morphological fem-
inine noun class, in which singular accusative, dative
and genitive cases have the same word form. Con-

<bodyText confidence="0.9984635">
sequently, IceMorphy generates the correct missing
tags: “nveþ” and “nvee”.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99478">
4.2 Local rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999932">
The purpose of a local rule is to eliminate inappro-
priate tags from words, based on a local context (a
window of 5 words; two words to the left and right
of the focus word). This reductionistic approach is
common in rule-based taggers. It is, for example,
used in the CG systems.
In principle, the local rules are unordered. The fir-
ing of a rule is, however, dependent on the order of
the words in a sentence. A sentence to be tagged is
scanned from left to right and all tags of each word
are checked in a sequence. Depending on the word
class (the first letter of the tag) of the focus word, the
token is sent to the appropriate disambiguation rou-
tine, which checks a variety of disambiguation con-
straints applicable to the particular word class and
the surrounding words. At each step, only tags for
the focus word are eliminated.
The format of a local rule is: If &lt;condition&gt;
eliminate tag t. A &lt;condition&gt; is a boolean
expression, whose individual components can re-
fer to lexical forms or individual characters (word
class/morphological features) of tags. The follow-
ing are examples of &lt;condition&gt; (L1/R1 and L2/R2
denote tokens one and two to the left/right of the fo-
cus word, F, respectively):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99857375">
L1.isOnlyWordClass(x) AND L2.isOnlyWordClass(y)
R1.isWordClass(x) OR R2.isWordClass(y)
L1.isWordClass(x) AND t.isCase(y) AND t.isGender(z)
R1.lexeme.equals(x) AND F.isWordClass(y)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998639266666667">
To exemplify, consider the sentence part: “við
vorum ... ” (we were ... ). The word “við” can
have the following five tags (“_” is used as a sep-
arator between tags): “ao_aþ_fp1fn_aa_nkeo”. For
illustration purposes, it is sufficient to point out
that the first two tags denote prepositions govern-
ing the accusative and the dative cases, respec-
tively. Since the following word is a verb (“vo-
rum”) and prepositions only precede nominals, a
rule, with &lt;condition&gt;=R1.isOnlyWordClass(Verb),
eliminates preposition tags in this context, leaving
only the tags “fp1fn_aa_nkeo”.
The current version of our tagger has 175 local
rules. The rules are written in a separate file and
compiled to Java code.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999253">
4.3 The heuristics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987324">
Once local disambiguation has been carried out,
each sentence is sent to a global heuristic mod-
ule, consisting of a collection of algorithmic proce-
dures. Its purpose is to perform grammatical func-
tion analysis, guess prepositional phrases (PPs) and
use the acquired knowledge to force feature agree-
ment where appropriate. We call these heuristics
global because, when disambiguating a particular
word, a heuristic can refer to a word which is not
in the nearest neighbourhood.
The heuristics repeatedly scan each sentence and
perform the following: 1) mark PPs, 2) mark verbs,
3) mark subjects, 4) force subject-verb agreement,
5) mark objects, 6) force subject-object agreement,
7) force verb-object agreement, 8) force nominal
agreement, and 9) force PP agreement. Lastly, the
default heuristic is simply to choose the most fre-
quent tag according to frequency information de-
rived from the IFD corpus. A detailed description of
all the heuristics can be found in (Loftsson, 2006b).

5 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999899809523809">
For evaluation, we used the pairs of ten training and
test corpora of the IFD corpus, produced by Helga-
dóttir (2004). We used the first nine of these test cor-
pora for evaluation, but the tenth one was set aside
and used as the development corpus for IceTagger.
For each test corpus (10% of the IFD) the corre-
sponding training corpus (90% of the IFD) was used
to deduce the lexicon(s) used by TnT, IceTagger and
IceMorphy. When testing the two taggers, we thus
made sure that the ratio of unknown words was (al-
most) the same.
The accuracy of a base tagger, which assigns each
known word its most frequent tag, and the most fre-
quent noun tag/proper noun tag to lower case/upper
case unknown words, is 76.27% (see table 2).
The average tagging accuracy of IceTagger for all
words is 91.54%, compared to 90.44% for TnT (see
table 2). IceTagger makes 11.5% less errors than
TnT1.
In order to improve the tagging accuracy of TnT,
we used the tag profile gap filling mechanism of Ice-

Morphy in the following manner. Each record in the
lexicon used by TnT consists of a word and the cor-
responding tags found in the training corpus. Addi-
tionally, to facilitate lexical probability calculations,
each tag is marked by its frequency (i.e. how of-
ten the tag appeared as a label for the given word).
We made IceMorphy generate a “filled” lexicon such
that each generated missing tag was marked with the
frequency 12. We call the resulting tagger TnT*. In-
deed, when testing TnT*, we obtained an overall av-
erage tagging accuracy of 91.18% (see table 2). Ice-
Tagger makes 4.1% less errors than TnT*.
The development of IceTagger/IceMorphy took 7
man-months, but it has been worth the effort. First,
IceTagger does make fewer errors than TnT, and its
accuracy can probably be increased by improving
its individual components. Secondly, we have used
IceTagger in various tagger combination methods to
further increase the tagging accuracy of Icelandic
text (Loftsson, 2006c).

In this paper, we have compared the tagging accu-
racy of our linguistic rule-based tagger, IceTagger,
to the accuracy of TnT, a state-of-the-art statistical
tagger.
IceTagger uses only about 175 local rules, but is
able to achieve high accuracy through the use of
global heuristics along with automatic tag profile
gap filling. The average tagging accuracy of Ice-
Tagger is 91.54%, compared to 90.44% obtained by
the TnT tagger. On the other hand, we were able to
obtain 91.18% accuracy using TnT along with the
tag profile gap filling mechanism of IceMorphy.

It uses a familiar approach to unknown word guessing, i.e. it performs morphological/compound analysis and ending analysis (Mikheev, 1997; Nakov et al., 2003). Additionally, IceMorphy includes an important module for handling tag profile gaps (for a thorough description of IceMorphy, consult (Loftsson, 2006a)). A tag profile gap arises when a particular word, listed in a lexicon derived from a corpus, has some missing tags in its tag profile (set of possible tags). The missing tag(s) might just not have been encountered during the derivation of the lexicon (e.g. during training). For each noun, adjective or verb, of a particular morphological class, IceMorphy is able to fill in the gaps for the given word. To illustrate, consider the word “konu” (woman), and let us assume that only the tag “nveo” (denoting noun, feminine, singular, accusative) is found in the lexicon.

Lastly, the default heuristic is simply to choose the most frequent tag according to frequency information derived from the IFD corpus. A detailed description of all the heuristics can be found in (Loftsson, 2006b). 5 Evaluation For evaluation, we used the pairs of ten training and test corpora of the IFD corpus, produced by Helgadóttir (2004). We used the first nine of these test corpora for evaluation, but the tenth one was set aside and used as the development corpus for IceTagger. For each test corpus (10% of the IFD) the corresponding training corpus (90% of the IFD) was used to deduce the lexicon(s) used by TnT, IceTagger and IceMorphy.

The development of IceTagger/IceMorphy took 7 man-months, but it has been worth the effort.

IceTagger uses only about 175 local rules, but is able to achieve high accuracy through the use of global heuristics along with automatic tag profile gap filling. The average tagging accuracy of IceTagger is 91.54%, compared to 90.44% obtained by the TnT tagger.
