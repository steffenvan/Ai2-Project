I examine how discourse anaphoric uses of the
definite pronoun it contrast with similar uses of
the demonstrative pronoun that. Their distinct
contexts of use are characterized in terms of two
contextual features—persistence of grammati-
cal subject and persistence of grammatical
form—which together demonstrate very clearly
the interrelation among lexical choice, grammati-
cal choices and the dimension of time in signalling
the dynamic attentional state of a discourse.

Languages vary in the number and kinds of gram-
matical distinctions encoded in their nominal and
pronominal systems. Language specific means
for explicitly mentioning and re-mentioning dis-
course entities constrain what Grosz and Sidner
refer to as the linguistic structure of discourse [2].
This in turn constrains the ways in which dis-
course participants can exploit linguistic structure
for indicating or inferring attentional state. At-
tentional state, Grosz and Sidner&apos;s term for the
dynamic representation of the participants&apos; focus
of attention [2], represents—among other things–
which discourse entities are currently most salient.
One function of attentional state is to help resolve
pronominal references. English has a relatively
impoverished set of definite pronouns in which
gender is relevant only in the 3rd person singu-
lar, and where number—a fairly universal nominal
category—is not relevant in the 2nd person. Yet
even within the English pronominal system, there
is a semantic contrast that provides language users
with alternative means for accessing the same pre-
viously mentioned entities, therefore providing in-
vestigators of language with an opportunity to ex-
plore how distinct lexicogrammatical features cor-
relate with distinct attentional processes. This
is the contrast between demonstrative and non-
demonstrative pronouns. In this paper I examine
how certain uses of the singular definite pronoun it
contrast with similar uses of the singular demon-
strative pronoun that.
I present evidence that the two pronouns it and
that have pragmatically distinct contexts of use
that can be characterized in terms of a remarkably
simple set of preconditions. First, in §2 I delineate
the precise nature of the comparison made here. In
§3.1, I describe the methods I used to collect and
analyze a set of data drawn from ordinary con-
versational interactions. The result of my statisti-
cal analysis was a single, highly significant multi-
dimensional distributional model, showing lexical
choice to be predicted by two features of the lo-
cal context. In §3.2, I summarize the statistical
results. They were strikingly clearcut, and pro-
vide confirmation that grammatical choices made
by participants in a dialogue prior to a particular
point in time correlate with lexical choice of either
participant at that time.
Of over a dozen different variables that were
examined, two alone turned out to have enor-
mous predictive power in distinguishing between
the typical contexts for the two pronouns. Very
briefly, the first variable, persistence of gram-
matical subject, indicates whether both the an-
tecedent and pronoun were subjects of their re-
spective clauses. The second, persistence of
grammatical form, indicates whether the an-
tecedent was a single word phrase or a multi-
word phrase, and if the latter, whether the phrase
was syntactically more clause-like or more noun-
like. Both variables point up the significance of
the temporal dimension of discourse in two ways.
The first has to do with the evanescence of sur-
face syntactic form—the two features pertaining
to the grammatical means used to refer to entities
are relevant only for a short time, namely across
two co-references [17]. The second has to do with
the dual nature of referring expressions—as noted
by Isard they are constrained by the prior con-
text but immediately alter the context and become
part of it [3] [18]. In §4 I discuss how the contrast
between the definite and demonstrative pronouns
is constrained by the local discourse context, and

discourse.
2 Comparability of it and that
Previous work has related the discourse deictic
uses of that to the global segmental structure of
discourse, and tied the contrast between it and
that to the distinction between units of informa-
tion introduced at the level of discourse segments
versus units of information introduced at the level
of the constituent structure of sentences [8] [12]
[18]. This paper deals only with the latter cate-
gory. That is, I am concerned with entities that
are evoked into the discourse model by explicit
mentions, i.e., noun phrases [19] or other intra-
sentential constituents, and with the difference be-
tween accessing these referents via the definite ver-
sus the demonstrative pronoun. Thus the data re-
ported on here are restricted to cases where one of
these pronouns has occurred with an explicit lin-
guistic antecedent that is a syntactic argument.&apos;
A pronoun&apos;s antecedent was taken to be a prior
linguistic expression evoking (or re-evoking) a dis-
course entity that provided a pronoun&apos;s referent.
The two expressions were not constrained to be
strictly coreferential since a wide variety of seman-
tic relationships may hold between cospecifying
expressions [1] [16] [19].
Syntactically it and that have very similar—
though not identical—privileges of occurrence.2
The following bullets briefly summarize their syn-
tactic differences.

drawer in it/*that)
Pronouns whose antecedents were independent tensed
clauses or clausal conjuncts were excluded from considera-
tion here; I reported on a much larger class of contexts in
[12] [13] (14].
2The contexts which discriminate between them syntac-
tically occurred very rarely in my data.
These differences, though they may ultimately
pertain to the phenomena presented here, won&apos;t be
discussed further. In general, that can occur with
the same syntactic types of antecedents with which
it occurs. Thus, apart from prosodic differences—
which were not considered here—the two pronouns
are extremely comparable semantically as well as
syntactically. Both pronouns are 3rd person, non-
animate, and singular. They are thus primarily
distinguished by the semantic feature of demon-
strativity.
An unforeseen but interesting fact is that the
proximal demonstrative this occurred very rarely.
So the relevant semantic contrast was that be-
tween definiteness and demonstrativity, and did
not include the proximal/non-proximal contrast
associated with this versus that. While I had
originally planned to investigate the contrast be-
tween the two demonstrative pronominals as well,
there were only 8 tokens of this out of .--.700 pro-
nouns whose antecedents were sentence internal
arguments. This strongly suggests that however
the attentional space of discourse entities is struc-
tured, it is not as differentiated as in the spatio-
temporal domain, where the contrast between this
and that is apparently more relevant. With respect
to the contexts examined here, the proximal/non-
proximal contrast between this and that is irrele-
vant.
A stretch of discourse evokes a set of discourse
entities, some of which can be accessed pronomi-
nally. Of these, some can be accessed by it, and
some can be accessed by that. The data I present
suggest that the availability of focussed entities for
definite and demonstrative pronominal reference
differs, and that the consequences on the subse-
quent attentional state also differs. The conditions
on and consequences of speaker choice of it or that
must be pragmatic, and further, it is likely that
the choice pertains to attentional state, since both
pronominalization and demonstrativity play such
a large role in indicating the attentional status of
their referents (cf. [8], [15], [18]).
The following excerpts from my conversational
data illustrate the syntactic variety of the pro-
nouns&apos; antecedents, and give a sense as well that
substituting one pronoun for another sometimes
results in an equally natural sounding discourse,
with the difference being a very subtle one, as

In this paper, I focus on the linguistic features
of the local context, i.e., the context containing a
pronoun token and its antecedent, in order to in-
vestigate the relationship between the pronominal
features of demonstrativity and definiteness and
the local attentional state of a discourse.

Psychologists and sociologists studying face-to-
face interaction have argued that the baseline of
interactive behavior is dyadic rather than monadic
[4] [9]; similarly, in understanding how speak-
ers cooperatively construct a discourse, the base-
line behavior must be dialogic rather than mono-
logic. The analytic methods employed here were
adapted from those used in studying social inter-
action among individuals. I analyzed the local
context of lexical choice between it and that in
four career-counseling interviews. The interviews

took place in a college career-counseling office, and
were not staged. The final corpus consisted of
over 3 1/2 hours of videotaped conversation be-
tween counselors and students. This provided an
excellent source of data, with the speakers con-
tributing tokens of it/that at the rate of roughly 1
in every 2 sentences, or a total of 1,183 tokens in
all. Nearly all of these were indexed and coded for
16 contextual variables characterizing the linguis-
tic structure of the local context.&apos; These variables
fell into two classes: those pertaining to the LIN-
EAR ORGANIZATION OF DISCOURSE, or to the re-
spective locations of the antecedent and pronoun,&apos;
and those pertaining to the SYNTACTIC FORM of
the antecedent expression.
Statistical analysis was used as a discovery pro-
cedure for finding the strongest determinants of
lexical choice, rather than to test a particular hy-
pothesis. The goal was to find the best fit between
the contextual variables and lexical choice, i.e.,
to include in a final statistical model only those
variables which were highly predictive. I used log-
linear statistical methods to construct a single best
multi-dimensional model; log-linear analysis per-
mits the use of the x-square statistic for greater
than 2-dimensional tables. This is advantageous,
because multi-dimensionality imposes more con-
straints on the statistical model, and is thus even
more reliable than 2-dimensional tables in reveal-
ing non-chance correlations. In addition to multi-
dimensionality, three other criteria guided the se-
lection of the best fit: a statistically significant
probability for the table, meaning a probability of
5.0% or lower; statistical independence of the pre-
dictive variables from one another, i.e., that they
represented truly distinct phenomena, rather than
overlapping factors; and finally, that the distribu-
tional patterns were the same for each individual
speaker and for each separate conversation, in or-
der to justify pooling the data into a single set.6

curred in the interlocutor&apos;s speech, but change of

e.g., measures of whether the antecedent and pronoun were
in the same, adjacent, or more distant sentences; how
deeply embedded syntactically the antecedent and pronoun
were; how many referential expressions with the same or
conflicting semantic features of person, number and gender
intervened between the pronoun and its antecedent; and
their respective grammatical roles (131.
6The reliability of the data was tested by comparing
within- and across-subjects statistical measures; i.e., I took
into account the data for the conversations as a whole, each
individual conversation, and each individual speaker [131.

speaker within the local context had no effect on
lexical choice, either alone, or in concert with other
factors. Before pooling the data from all con-
versations and all individual speakers into a sin-
gle population, the variability across conversations
and speakers was tested and found to be insignif-
icant. Thus the results presented below represent
a speaker behavior-lexical choice of pronoun-
that is extraordinarily consistent across speakers,
that is independent of whether a pronoun and its
antecedent occurred in the same speaker&apos;s turn,
independent of individual speaker and even of in-
dividual conversation. Consequently, it is justifi-
able to assume that the factors found to predict
lexical choice pertain to communicatively relevant
purposes. In other words, whatever these factors
are, they presumably pertain not only to models
of speech production, but also to models of speech
comprehension.

the intercept indicates that the two variables are
clearly independent, or in other words, repre-
sent two distinct contexts. The exceedingly low
probabilities of 0.01% for the contextual variables
and the highly significant table k-square (i.e.,
close to 1) indicate that the model is extremely
significant.8 The correlation between the depen-
dent dimension of lexical choice and the two inde-
pendent dimensions, persistence of grammat-
ical subject and persistence of grammati-
cal form, presents an intuitively very satisfying
view-yet not an obvious one a priori-of how
all three variables conspire together to convey the
current attentional status of a discourse referent.
First I will summarize the effects of the two con-
textual variables one at a time. Then I will review
the distributionally significant facts as a whole.
First Dimension: Persistence of Grammat-
ical Subject. The first dimension of the model
is binary and the two contexts it defines are in
diametric opposition to one another; it was likely

to occur in exactly one of the two contexts, and
that was likely to occur in the opposing context. If
both referring expressions were subjects, then the
lexical choice was far more likely to be it than that.
All it took for the balance to swing in favor of the
demonstrative was for either the pronoun itself or
for its antecedent to be a non-subject. The two
relevant contexts, then are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991081333333333">
• those in which both the antecedent and the
target pronoun are syntactic subjects; IT
• all other contexts. = THAT
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970587176470588">
Parallelism has sometimes been suggested as an
organizing factor across clauses. It is certainly a
strong stylistic device, but did not make a strong
enough independent contribution to the statistical
model to be included as a distinct variable. To
repeat, the crucial factor was found to be that
both expressions were subjects, not that both had
the same grammatical function in their respective
clauses. In §4.1 I will review the relationship of
these results to the centering literature [1] [5] [6].
Second Dimension: Persistence of Gram-
matical Form. While many grammatical dis-
tinctions among sentence constituents are possi-
ble, the syntactic form of a pronoun&apos;s antecedent
correlated with the choice between it and that in
the following very specific way. The 3 discriminat-
ing contexts were where the antecedent was:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9959545">
• any pronoun—the lexical choice for an an-
tecedent pronoun had no effect on the lexical
choice of the subsequent pronoun; IT
• a canonical NP headed by a noun (including
nominalizations); = IT or THAT
• and all other types of constituents. THAT
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99961821875">
The latter category included gerundives, infiniti-
val expressions, and embedded finite clauses.9 For
contexts with a pronominal antecedent, the lexical
choice was far more likely to be it. For canonical
NP antecedents, it and that were equally likely, re-
gardless of the type of head. For other types of
constituents, that was far more likely. Thus there
are two opposing contexts and one which doesn&apos;t
discriminate between the two pronouns, i.e., a con-
text in which the opposition is neutralized.
g Cf. [141 for a detailed discussion of how the precise
dividing line between types of antecedents was determined.
The dynamic component of this dimension is
that it indicates, for a consecutive pair of co-
specifying expressions, whether there has been a
shift towards a surface form that is syntactically
more compact and semantically less explicit, and
if so, how great a shift. In the first context, where
the antecedent is already pronominal, there is no
shift, and it has a much higher probability of oc-
currence than that. The context in which there is a
shift from a lexical NP to a phrasal NP, i.e., a shift
from a reduced form to an unreduced one, but no
categorial shift, doesn&apos;t discriminate between the
two pronouns. The context favoring that is the
one in which there is not only a shift from a single
word to a multi-word phrase, but also a change in
the categorial status of the phrase from a non-NP
constituent to a lexical NP.
Full 3-way model. Table 2 displays the data in
a finer-grained two-dimensional x-square table in
order to show separately all 4 of the possible out-
comes, i.e., it or that as a subject or non-subject.
In this table, the row headings represent the an-
tecedent&apos;s form and grammatical role; the column
headings represent the lexical choice and gram-
matical role of the subsequent pronominal expres-
sion. Each cell of the table indicates the absolute
frequency, the expected frequency given a non-
chance distribution, and the cell x-square, with
the latter in boldface type to indicate the signif-
icant cells. This is a somewhat more perspicu-
ous view of the data because it can be displayed
schematically in terms of initial states, final states,
and enhanced, suppressed or neutral transitions,
as in Fig. 1. However, it is also a somewhat mis-
leading transformation of the 3-dimensional view
given in table 1, because it suggests that the gram-
matical role of a pronoun and that of its an-
tecedent are independent factors. Since the sta-
tistical model shown in table 1 is actually the best
fit of the data, better than other models that were
tested in which the grammatical role of each ex-
pression was treated separately [13], it is crucial to
recognize that the statistically significant factor is
the pair-wise comparison of subject status.
Large cell x-squares in Table 2 indicate the sig-
nificant contexts, and a comparison of the absolute
and expected frequencies in these cells indicate
whether the context is significantly frequent or sig-
nificantly infrequent. Thus there are 3 types of
cells in the table representing the contexts of lexi-
cal choice as chance events, as enhanced events, or
as suppressed events. In Fig. 1, I have translated

subject or non-subject. Absence of final states for
the nonNP-Subj initial state indicates that this set
of contexts is extremely rare. In the following sec-
tion, I discuss the relation of these events to an

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897">
The outcome of this study is not a model of at-
tentional processes per se, but rather, a set of fac-
tors pertaining to attentional structure that elu-
cidates the shifting functions of the demonstra-
tive pronoun in English discourse. The particular
function served by that seems to depend on what
functional contrasts are available given the current
attentional state.
It is most useful to think of the data in terms
of two major categories of phenomena. The first
category is where a discourse entity has already
been mentioned pronominally. In this case, main-
tenance of reference in subject grammatical role is
a particularly signficant determinant of the choice
between it and that. This effect is discussed in
§4.1 in relation to the notion of centering. The
second category is where a discourse entity most
recently evoked by a multi-word phrase is subse-
quently referenced by a pronoun. While gram-
matical role is relevant here, its relevance seems
to depend on a more salient distinction pertaining
to the syntactico-semantic type of the discourse
entity, as discussed in §4.2.

4.1 Definite/Demonstrative
Pronouns and Centering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999685514285714">
The literature on attentional state has shown that
both pronominalization and grammatical role af-
fect the attentional status of a discourse entity. In
this section I will show how the use of the definite
pronoun it conforms in particular to the predic-
tions made by Kameyama [6] [5] regarding canon-
ical and non-canonical center-retention, and that
the demonstrative pronoun is incompatible with
center-retention.
The centering model predicts that an utterance
will contain a referent that is distinguished as the
backward looking center (Cb) [1], and that if the
Cb of an utterance is coreferential with the Cb of
the prior utterance, it will be pronominalized [1].
Kameyama [6] proposes that there are two means
for retaining a discourse entity as the Cb, canon-
ical center-retention--both references in subject
role—and non-canonical center retention—neither
reference in subject role. As shown in Fig. 1,
the most enhanced context for lexical choice of it
(context 1) was where both the pronoun and its
pronominal antecedent were subjects, i.e., canoni-
cal center-retention. The next most enhanced con-
text for it (context 7) was where neither the pro-
noun nor its pronominal antecedent were subjects,
i.e., non-canonical center-retention. Thus, the def-
inite pronoun correlates with both canonical and
non-canonical center retention.
Lexical choice of it is actively suppressed in
contexts which are incompatible with center-
retention. Note in Fig. 1 that if the antecedent is
neither a pronoun nor a subject, a subsequent ref-
erence via it in subject role is suppressed (contexts
13 and 21). The only (non-rare) context where an

where the antecedent is a canonical NP in subject
role (context 9) (cf. §4.2).
The demonstrative pronoun is actively sup-
pressed in the case of canonical center-retention
(context 2); i.e, given two successive pronominal
references to the same entity where reference is
maintained in subject role, the referent&apos;s atten-
tional state is such that it precludes demonstrative
reference. Use of that is also suppressed if the an-
tecedent is a potential candidate for canonical cen-
ter retention, even if reference is not maintained
in subject role (context 4).
Attentional state is only one component of a
discourse structure. The discourse model as a
whole will contain representations of many of the
things to whcih the discourse participants can sub-
sequently refer, including discourse entities evoked
by NPs, and additionally, as argued by Webber
[18], discourse segments. Webber notes that dis-
course segment referents may have a different sta-
tus from the discourse entities evoked by NPs,
at least until they have been pronominally refer-
enced. However, she suggests that when a demon-
strative pronoun refers to a discourse entity, it
accesses that entity by a process which first in-
volves accessing the discourse segment in which
the discourse entity is introduced. In other words,
she posits two distinct referential processes, de-
ictic and anaphoric reference, and suggests that
even when a demonstrative pronoun refers to a
discourse entity, the process of finding the refer-
ent is distinct in kind from anaphoric reference
to the same entity. While I have no evidence that
bears directly on such a claim, my data do indicate
that some entities in a discourse segment are ordi-
narily unavailable via the demonstrative pronoun,
namely entities that would be expected canonical
centers, as described in the preceding paragraph.
Thus my data support the view that there are dis-
tinct processes for accessing entities in the model.
It is relevant to note here that the notion of
Cb is generally discussed in terms of links between
successive utterances. Since there is an extraor-
dinary frequency of conjoined sentences in con-
versational language, I distinguished between ut-
terances and independent clauses within an ut-
terance. The successive references in my data
were in successive sentences a majority of the time
(roughly 2/3; cf. [13]), but were sometimes sepa-
rated by one or more sentences (roughly 1/6) and
sometimes occurred in the same sentence (roughly
1/6). This distance factor had no correlation with
lexical choice of pronoun, which suggests that dis-
course segment structure interacts with centering.
The relevant local context for center-retention may
not be successive sentences/utterances, but rather,
successive sentences/utterances within the same
discourse segment. In any case, for the data pre-
sented here, the relevant local context consisted of
two successive co-specifying phrases, not two suc-
cessive utterances.
Since the primary objective of this study was
to examine various features of the context imme-
diately preceding a given type of pronoun, rather
than to track the discourse history of particular
entities, little can be said here about the general
case of multiple successive references to the same
entity. However, I did investigate a subset of this
general case, namely, successive pronominal refer-
ences to the same entity where the initial men-
tion was a canonical NP, and where each next co-
specifying pronoun served as the antecedent for a
subsequent pronoun. I refer to these as pronoun
chains.10 The relative likelihood of it and that
was the same for the first slot in the chain, which
conforms to the general distribution for pronouns
with NP antecedents. The ratio of it to that in the
last position of a chain conforms to chance, i.e., it
equals the ratio of it to that in the pronoun chain
sample. But within a chain, that is strongly pre-
dicted by persistence of grammatical form.
The demonstrative occured rarely within chains,
but where it did occur, either the demonstrative
token or its antecedent was a non-subject. This
was found to be the only factor pertaining to lin-
guistic structure that affected the occurrence of
that within a pronoun chain.
A final set of conclusions derived from the
pronominal initial states in Fig. 1 pertains to the
non-predictive contexts, i.e., those which neither
enhance nor suppress center-retention, and those
which neither enhance nor suppress demonstrative
reference. These are cases where there is either
a shift in grammatical role, or where the lexical
choice is that (contexts 3, 5, 6 and 8). When a cen-
ter is not retained across two successive utterances
(in the same discourse segement), then it is likely
that the global context is affected [1], perhaps by a
center-shift (cf. [5]), or by a segment boundary (cf.
[7], 1111). Centers seem generally to be unavailable
for demonstrative reference, but contexts 6 and 8
1°The term seems to have appeared in the philosophical
and linguistic literature at about the same time, e.g., in
works by K. Donnellan, C. Chastain, M. Halliday and D.
Zubin. There were a total of 101 such chains comprising
305 total pronoun tokens; they ranged in length from 2 to
13 pronouns.

in Fig. 1 perhaps represent a mechanism whereby
an entity maintained as center can become avail-
able for demonstrative reference; e.g., context 6
may coincide with the chaining context discussed
in the preceding paragraph, whereby a locally fo-
cussed entity can be accessed by that just in case
the prior reference was a non-subject. Context
8 suggests that demonstrative reference is more
available in contexts of non-canonical center re-
tention than canonical center retention.

I have argued elsewhere that the crucial dis-
tinction for the category of non-pronominal an-
tecedents is the contrast between true NPS with
NP syntax, versus all other types of syntactic argu-
ments ([12] [14]). This raises two important issues
pertaining to the status of the discourse entities
evoked by NPs versus other kinds of arguments.
The first is that if non-NP arguments evoke dis-
course entities, which they certainly must, such
entities apparently have a different status in the
model than discourse entities evoked by NPs, given
that the combination of lexical choice between it
and that and grammatical function so clearly dis-
tinguish them. The second issue is that although
the difference in status seems—at first blush—to
correlate with a syntactic property, the distinction
may ultimately be semantic in nature. I will dis-
cuss each issue in turn.
Two of the non-pronominal initial states in Fig.
1 are distinguished by neither enhancing nor sup-
pressing any of the possible transitions to it or
that: NP subjects (9-12), and non-NP non-subjects
(17-20). The extreme rarity of the latter suggests
that non-NPs don&apos;t occur as grammatical subjects,
or that when they do, they are not likely to be re-
evoked by a pronoun. On the other hand, NP sub-
jects are fairly frequent in the contexts where it
or that occurs with a non-pronominal antecedent,
thus the absence here of enhanced or suppressed
transitions suggests that an entity mentioned as
an NP subject is free to be accessed in a variety
of ways, or more precisely, that it has a relatively
unspecified attentional state. It is neither a par-
ticularly likely Cb nor is it particularly available or
unavailable for demonstrative reference.
The two remaining non-subject initial states,
i.e., NP non-subjects and non-NP non-subjects,
both suppress subsequent reference via it subjects,
as mentioned in the previous section. While NP
subjects apparently have a somewhat unspecified
attentional status, NP non-subjects enhance the
lexical choice of non-subject that. It appears that
discourse entities evoked by NPs which are not sub-
jects are in an attentional state that is quite dif-
ferent from that of canonical center retention.
It is especially interesting that when the an-
tecedent is a non-NP non-subject, a subsequent
pronominal reference is most likely to be demon-
strative, and most likely to be a subject.&amp;quot; The en-
hancement of a that-subject context is completely
contrary to the pattern established for subjects
and for the demonstrative pronoun. These facts
contribute to the view that entities evoked by non-
NP constituents have a special status, but what
this status is remains to be determined. In pre-
vious work, I emphasized the syntactic distinc-
tion with respect to lexical choice between it and
that [14]. Although the most obvious difference
is the purely syntactic one, the syntactic distinc-
tion between NP and non-NP constituents has a
number of semantico-pragmatic consequences. In
discussing the nominal and temporal anaphora
within Kamp&apos;s framework of discourse represen-
tation structures (DRS), Partee raised the ques-
tion of the difference in status between event-
describing clauses and nominalizations [10]. In-
dependent clauses differ from the class of non-
NP constituents under consideration here in that
the latter occur as arguments of superordinate
verbs, and are thus entities participating in a de-
scribed situation, as well as descriptions of situa-
tions. However, true noun phrases—whether they
describe events or not—can have definite or indef-
inite determiners, and cannot have tense or any
aspectual categories associated with the verb. The
study presented here brings us no closer to a so-
lution to the questions posed by Partee regarding
the ontology and representation of different kinds
of event descriptions, but it does offer further con-
firmation that entities evoked by NP and non-NP
constituents have a different conceptual status,
given the different possibilities for lexical choice
and grammatical role of a subsequent pronominal
mention.

The two expressions were not constrained to be strictly coreferential since a wide variety of semantic relationships may hold between cospecifying expressions [1] [16] [19]. Syntactically it and that have very similar— though not identical—privileges of occurrence.2 The following bullets briefly summarize their syntactic differences. • that, but not it, is categorially ambiguous, occurring either as a determiner or as an independent pronoun • it, but not that, has a reflexive and a possessive form (itselfl*thatself, itsl*thats) • it, but not that, may occur in prepositional phrases where the pronoun in the PP corefers with a c-commanding NP (the table with a drawer in it/*that) Pronouns whose antecedents were independent tensed clauses or clausal conju</context>

In §4.1 I will review the relationship of these results to the centering literature [1] [5] [6]. Second Dimension: Persistence of Grammatical Form.

In this section I will show how the use of the definite pronoun it conforms in particular to the predictions made by Kameyama [6] [5] regarding canonical and non-canonical center-retention, and that the demonstrative pronoun is incompatible with center-retention. The centering model predicts that an utterance will contain a referent that is distinguished as the backward looking center (Cb) [1], and that if the Cb of an utterance is coreferential with the Cb of the prior utterance, it will be pronominalized [1]. Kameyama [6] proposes that there are two means for retaining a discourse entity as the Cb, canonical center-retention--both references in subject role—and non-canonical center retention—neither reference in subject role. As shown in Fig. 1, the most enhanced context for lexical choice of it (context 1) was where both the pronoun and its pronominal antecedent were subjects, i.e., canonical center-retention.

Language specific means for explicitly mentioning and re-mentioning discourse entities constrain what Grosz and Sidner refer to as the linguistic structure of discourse [2]. This in turn constrains the ways in which discourse participants can exploit linguistic structure for indicating or inferring attentional state. Attentional state, Grosz and Sidner&apos;s term for the dynamic representation of the participants&apos; focus of attention [2], represents—among other things– which discourse entities are currently most salient. One function of attentional state is to help resolve pronominal references.

Independent clauses differ from the class of nonNP constituents under consideration here in that the latter occur as arguments of superordinate verbs, and are thus entities participating in a described situation, as well as descriptions of situations. However, true noun phrases—whether they describe events or not—can have definite or indefinite determiners, and cannot have tense or any aspectual categories associated with the verb.

However, it is also a somewhat misleading transformation of the 3-dimensional view given in table 1, because it suggests that the grammatical role of a pronoun and that of its antecedent are independent factors. Since the statistical model shown in table 1 is actually the best fit of the data, better than other models that were tested in which the grammatical role of each expression was treated separately [13], it is crucial to recognize that the statistically significant factor is the pair-wise comparison of subject status. Large cell x-squares in Table 2 indicate the significant contexts, and a comparison of the absolute and expected frequencies in these cells indicate whether the context is significantly frequent or significantly infrequent. Thus there are 3 types of cells in the table representing the contexts of lexical choice as chance events, as enhanced events, or as suppressed events. In Fig. 1, I have translated 55 1.

Thus my data support the view that there are distinct processes for accessing entities in the model. It is relevant to note here that the notion of Cb is generally discussed in terms of links between successive utterances. Since there is an extraordinary frequency of conjoined sentences in conversational language, I distinguished between utterances and independent clauses within an utterance. The successive references in my data were in successive sentences a majority of the time (roughly 2/3; cf. [13]), but were sometimes separated by one or more sentences (roughly 1/6) and sometimes occurred in the same sentence (roughly 1/6). This distance factor had no correlation with lexical choice of pronoun, which suggests that discourse segment structure interacts with centering. The relevant local context for center-retention may not be successive sentences/utterances, but rather, successive sentences/utterances within the same discourse segment. In any case, for the data presented here, the relevant local context consisted of two successive co-specifying phrases, not two successive utterances. Si</context>

The data I present suggest that the availability of focussed entities for definite and demonstrative pronominal reference differs, and that the consequences on the subsequent attentional state also differs. The conditions on and consequences of speaker choice of it or that must be pragmatic, and further, it is likely that the choice pertains to attentional state, since both pronominalization and demonstrativity play such a large role in indicating the attentional status of their referents (cf. [8], [15], [18]). The following excerpts from my conversational data illustrate the syntactic variety of the pronouns&apos; antecedents, and give a sense as well that substituting one pronoun for another sometimes results in an equally natural sounding discourse, with the difference being a very subtle one, as 52 in 2.3 Occasionally, the substitution creates discourse that is pragmatically odd, as in 6. 1.

Both variables point up the significance of the temporal dimension of discourse in two ways. The first has to do with the evanescence of surface syntactic form—the two features pertaining to the grammatical means used to refer to entities are relevant only for a short time, namely across two co-references [17]. The second has to do with the dual nature of referring expressions—as noted by Isard they are constrained by the prior context but immediately alter the context and become part of it [3] [18].

Both variables point up the significance of the temporal dimension of discourse in two ways. The first has to do with the evanescence of surface syntactic form—the two features pertaining to the grammatical means used to refer to entities are relevant only for a short time, namely across two co-references [17]. The second has to do with the dual nature of referring expressions—as noted by Isard they are constrained by the prior context but immediately alter the context and become part of it [3] [18]. In §4 I discuss how the contrast between the definite and demonstrative pronouns is constrained by the local discourse context, and 51 how the constraining features of the local context • it, but not that, can be used non-referentially in combination with the lexical contrast provides (it/*that is raining; it/*that is hard to find an evidence about modelling the attentional state of honest politician) discourse. 2 Comparability of it and that Previous work has related the discourse deictic uses of that to the global segmental structure of discourse, and tied the contrast between it and that </context>

The data I present suggest that the availability of focussed entities for definite and demonstrative pronominal reference differs, and that the consequences on the subsequent attentional state also differs. The conditions on and consequences of speaker choice of it or that must be pragmatic, and further, it is likely that the choice pertains to attentional state, since both pronominalization and demonstrativity play such a large role in indicating the attentional status of their referents (cf. [8], [15], [18]). The following excerpts from my conversational data illustrate the syntactic variety of the pronouns&apos; antecedents, and give a sense as well that substituting one pronoun for another sometimes results in an equally natural sounding discourse, with the difference being a very subtle one, as 52 in 2.3 Occasionally, the substitution creates discourse that is pragmatically odd, as in 6. 1. A: so [you plan to] work for a while, save some money, travel—B: save SOME MONEY and then blow IT (/THAT) off and then go to school 2. what does NOTORIETY mean to you, where does THAT (/IT) put you 3.

Use of that is also suppressed if the antecedent is a potential candidate for canonical center retention, even if reference is not maintained in subject role (context 4). Attentional state is only one component of a discourse structure. The discourse model as a whole will contain representations of many of the things to whcih the discourse participants can subsequently refer, including discourse entities evoked by NPs, and additionally, as argued by Webber [18], discourse segments. Webber notes that discourse segment referents may have a different status from the discourse entities evoked by NPs, at least until they have been pronominally referenced. However, she suggests that when a demonstrative pronoun refers to a discourse entity, it accesses that entity by a process which first involves accessing the discourse segment in which the discourse entity is introduced. In other words, she posits two distinct referential processes, deictic and anaphoric reference, and suggests that even when a demonstrative pronoun refers to a discourse entity, the pro</context>

This paper deals only with the latter category. That is, I am concerned with entities that are evoked into the discourse model by explicit mentions, i.e., noun phrases [19] or other intrasentential constituents, and with the difference between accessing these referents via the definite versus the demonstrative pronoun. Thus the data reported on here are restricted to cases where one of these pronouns has occurred with an explicit linguistic antecedent that is a syntactic argument.&apos; A pronoun&apos;s antecedent was taken to be a prior linguistic expression evoking (or re-evoking) a discourse entity that provided a pronoun&apos;s referent. The two expressions were not constrained to be strictly coreferential since a wide variety of semantic relationships may hold between cos</context>
