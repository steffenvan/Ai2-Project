Quantitative linguistics (QL) is a branch of science that is not as new as is usually
supposed. Its actual beginning was in the early 1930s, and the discipline developed
mainly in Eastern Europe. Like computational linguistics, QL deals with linguistic
phenomena from a mathematical point of view: QL employs mathematical analysis,
probability theory and stochastic processes, and differential equations to model and
understand phenomena of language and communication. The mathematical theories
of QL are more developed as theories than merely tools to compute. The introduction
of quantitative models actually gave a new impetus to an in-depth understanding of
the nature of linguistic entities. An interesting comparison could be made between de-
terministic and stochastic rules, when it comes to investigating linguistic phenomena:
the first are just special cases of the second ones, and QL is searching for universal
and invariable laws that govern linguistic processes. But sometimes we must allow
that searching is not the same as finding: some proposed laws are only tentative, still
far away from a consistent theory.
This important branch of studies collected a number of specialists over the decades;
but only recently did they find the opportunity to join in the International Quantitative
Linguistics Conference, the first of which was held at the University of Trier, Germany,
in September 1991, with 120 participants from 16 countries. This volume collects 22
papers accepted and presented, in addition to four general lectures given by invited
speakers, and it provides a representative overview of the state of the art. The topical
sections are eight in number, and cover a large spectrum of interests: from phonetics
to statistics, from modeling to dialectology, as well as reports and projects of different
kinds. The organization of the book is very good, as an effort was made to present all
contributions through the same structure: introduction, results, conclusions, and open
problems.
The book is completely in English, but, as usual among linguists, the references
don&apos;t quote only books written in English, and a large panorama of books in different
languages is offered: after English, German is far ahead of the other languages as
second.
Single contributions cannot be mentioned here individually; but at least three of
them deserve special attention. First, Mildred Shaw and Brian Gaines propose a very
interesting methodology in analyzing terminological and conceptual differences, with
practical examples on a Macintosh computer. This contribution is very exhaustive and
summarizes the whole theory of distinctions and their representation; it could have
been offered in a CL conference as well. Second is H. Goebl&apos;s paper about dialectom-
etry, i.e., distances among dialects, where the extremely careful analysis goes together
with several suggestive color maps of the regions in Northern Italy where different

dialects are spoken. Third, another aspect which is very rarely studied is the repair of
mistakes that a speaker makes while speaking: the type of repair usually gives much
more information than the plain correct sentence, as we can guess from the paper by
U. Schade and U. Laubenstein.
Some other topics are well known, such as the problem of evaluating word length,
or the systems for phoneme-to-grapheme conversion, or the probabilistic scaling of
texts, but the contributions in this book succeed in adding still a little bit more, espe-
cially when dealing with an extinct language. A couple of papers are nearly entirely
devoted to statistical tables, a subject I judge not that fascinating, but which still has
its fans.
Unlike other conference proceedings, which are usually devoted to the specialists
of the field, this volume can be understood also by researchers in neighboring disci-
plines: the main lectures, perhaps except one, deal with very general topics, and the
mathematical tools are really easy, even from the point of view of a nonmathematician:
the question of minimization in synergetic linguistics, for instance, should deserve a
treatment—and this could be a fruitful idea for young researchers—through more re-
fined techniques, even borrowed from CL. The most difficult differential equation is
of the first order with constant coefficients, so solutions are straightforward, even for
linguists.
