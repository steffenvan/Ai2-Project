The handling of questions in a computational system falls into one of the more obvious
convergences of natural language processing and human factors. The relationship of
a user to an information system is fundamentally that of inquiring; at the same time,
questions are asked in many different forms other than the simply interrogative, and
much contextual knowledge must be maintained in order to understand what ques-
tion is really being asked and what is the most informative answer. In Questions and
Information Systems, Lauer, Peacock, and Graesser present 15 articles with the goal of
presenting a wide, multi-disciplinary perspective on questioning. What is successful
about the book, however, is not the breadth of perspective but rather the focus on
descriptive models and the empirical studies that underlie them.
The book is a compilation of amplified papers originally presented at a 1990 confer-
ence at Oakland University, Michigan. The articles in the book are organized along the
following general topics: determining system information requirements (Chapters 2-
5), design of computer interfaces (6-9), questions and large databases (10-12), and
understanding complex decision processes (13-16). Regardless of the functional dis-
cussion, though, the articles in the book generally present ways of gathering empirical
data on questioning behavior, and of representing this behavior in terms of question
types. These two themes are the bases of the topics in the book. Both the approach
toward data collection and the various representation schemes proposed are generally
departures from the work of editor Graesser. In that sense, Chapter 9 (Graesser et al.,
&amp;quot;Mechanisms that generate questions&amp;quot;), together with Chapter 12 (Graesser et al., &amp;quot;An-
swering questions about information in databases&amp;quot;) state the fundamental principles
of most of the work reported in the book.
In Chapter 9, the authors zero in on a particular (empirically motivated) type of
questioning, that of genuinely desiring to solicit new information. These &amp;quot;inquiries&amp;quot;
are not always in the surface form of a question, of course, leading to an appeal to
the Modern Language Philosophy concept of &amp;quot;speech act&amp;quot; (Searle 1969) to distinguish
between the form of what is said and the intended effect on the hearer. The usage
of &amp;quot;speech act&amp;quot; here is a bit less than rigorous, and that of &amp;quot;taxonomy&amp;quot; almost a
misnomer, but the point is successfully conveyed that there are derivable, motivated
categorizations of inquiries based on the mechanisms of generating inquiries (similar
to what Searle would derive as perlocutionary force): correction of knowledge deficit,
monitoring common ground, social coordination of action, and control of conversation
and attention.
In Chapter 12, Graesser et al. detail the QUEST model of question answering,
intended to account for human question-answering behavior. Its major components

are: interpreting the question (parsing and identifying the question type); accessing
information sources (a variety of generic and episodic knowledge representation struc-
tures); using convergence mechanisms (intersecting the nodes on the retrieved knowl-
edge structures), and verifying pragmatics (conformance to goals, informativeness,
etc.). Essentially, the QUEST model maps the logical form of question into a struc-
tured set of structured knowledge representations, these latter structures being of a
variety of forms (taxonomies, conceptual graphs, causal models, etc.) depending on
the nature of the relationships obtaining among relevant concepts in the knowledge
structure. (Chapter 3, Gordon and Gill&apos;s &amp;quot;Knowledge acquisition with question probes
and conceptual graph structures&amp;quot; expands on representational structures.) Structures
may be episodic (instances of experience) or generic (generalizations over many such
episodes). These knowledge sources are accessed, the relevant parts retrieved, and
then intersected to form a set of possible answers. These possible answers are finally
filtered by informativeness and usefulness in the setting in which the question was
created (intended goal of asker/answerer, for instance). The difficulty in this model,
as in every human knowledge representation model, is the size and shape that the
information sources must be to accommodate the sorts of general questioning and an-
swering that humans do all the time. Therefore the implementation of QUEST-based
computational systems has the onus of structuring huge amounts of knowledge, and
even then limiting the domain scope of a QUEST prototype in an empirically moti-
vated way. Nevertheless, QUEST is a very useful model against which to consider
individual issues in question answe ring.
The reference to the importance of pragmatics in Chapter 12 is an extremely im-
portant one, especially in the context of the nature of cooperation implicit in asking
questions. A fuller explication of the role of pragmatics in an extension to the QUEST
model is described in Chapter 11 (Golding et al., &amp;quot;WHEN: A model for answering
&apos;when&apos; questions about future events&amp;quot;). Here, conversational maxims (Grice 1975) are
cited as a basis for determining not the truth but the relevance, informativeness, clar-
ity, etc., expected of a reply. The authors describe an experiment in which scenarios
with varying &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; parameters were queried. The responses indicate the
appropriateness of day-name responses versus calendar dates and relative dates.
This bias toward empirical data collection is shared widely by the authors of
the book, and is a welcome theme to foster, particularly in knowledge representation
and in discourse, both relevant to question answering. In particular, Chapter 5 (Lipp
et al., &amp;quot;The evolution of questions in successive versions of an expert system for real
estate disposition&amp;quot;) describes a rather intense data-collection task using real-estate ex-
perts, asking each other questions about cases, to develop a knowledge base, and to
learn about the nature of informed questions at the same time. The empirical theme,
aimed toward modeling question types and contexts, is continued in Chapter 4 (Lauer
et al., &amp;quot;Question generation and the systems analysis process&amp;quot;), Chapter 6 (Carroll
and Rosson, &amp;quot;Design by question: Developing user questions into scenario representa-
tions for design&amp;quot;), and Chapters 13 (Lauer and Peacock, &amp;quot;Question-driven information
search in auditor diagnosis&amp;quot;), 14 (Steinbart, &amp;quot;The role of questioning in learning from
computer-based decision aids&amp;quot;), and 15 (Paradice, &amp;quot;A question-theoretic analysis of
problem formulation: Implications for computer-based support&amp;quot;).
Two papers differ significantly from the overall themes of the book. The first article
(Chapter 2, LaFrance, &amp;quot;Questioning knowledge acquisition&amp;quot;) challenges the ordinary
assumptions about the relationship of knowledge to questions, as if to depart from the
general focus of the rest of the chapters before the reader encounters them. LaFrance
claims that questions are themselves informative, in fact, that it is questions, not static
knowledge representations, that organize the knowledge of the answer. Thus there are

no static bodies of knowledge in the expert&apos;s head; these structures are instead gener-
ated as a response to questions as the organizing principle. This axiom, that questions
do not &amp;quot;extract&amp;quot; information (though they do cause its acquisition), is one of six chal-
lenging axioms involving the deep interaction of knowledge engineer and expert, of
what the question really does and the actual truth, completeness, and generalizability
of the answer. Surprisingly, the claims are not entirely incompatible with the adher-
ents of the QUEST-type models, despite the latter&apos;s dependence upon pre-existing
knowledge structures: the focus on the interaction as the center of the question and
its answer, particularly in establishing common conversational ground, is a position
that LaFrance shares.
Indeed, Chapter 16 (Kass, &amp;quot;Question asking, artificial intelligence, and human cre-
ativity&amp;quot;) may provide a connecting point between the divergent positions on knowl-
edge structures. Kass&apos;s AT system adapts to answer novel questions by asking itself
questions. Thus, at the same time it creates knowledge structures in LaFrance&apos;s sense
and makes generalizations from episodic knowledge in Graesser&apos;s sense.
The second departure from the general theme of the book is Chapter 10 (Dahlgren,
&amp;quot;Interpretation of textual queries using a cognitive model&amp;quot;). This paper essentially de-
scribes the design of the Interpretext natural language text-understanding system, in
terms of the generally accepted precision—recall advantages of such designs over key-
word searches. Dahlgren has the opportunity here to address the interesting implica-
tions of adding querying to modern message understanding. But she shies away from
this, though, essentially adding a passage about the advantages of using the same
understanding mechanism to process both queries and the text to be retrieved. In
slighting that discussion, the author misses the focus that connects text understanding
to the book&apos;s themes.
Chapter 10 is one of a number of places that would have been appropriate for
a discussion of discourse problems compounded by question—answer scenarios. In
natural language interfaces to databases (NLIs), the sequence of question/retrieval/re-
question has always been a particular challenge. Beyond the usual text anaphoric
reference problems, here an anaphor can point either to the previous answer or to
the previous question, and thus both structures need to be present and accessible
in the natural language processing. The issue is not addressed in the book, though
a well-articulated QUEST-type information structure could in theory accommodate
it. Chapter 8 (Lang et al., &amp;quot;Question-asking in human—computer interfaces&amp;quot;) has a
useful overview of NLIs, various compromises of them (e.g., the Texas Instruments
guided NLI approach of the mid 1980s), and a fair sample of other interfaces used
for computer tasks that involve human questioning. Again, no explicit reference is
made to the NLI discourse problem noted above. However, the Point &amp; Query model
interface proposed creates a guided question-asking system (more like the TI model
than they concede) in a mixed-initiative environment that should allow the handling
of follow-up queries directly through the use of feedback.
While not entirely encyclopedic in covering the salient issues in question answer-
ing, then, Lauer et al. have focused on ground that is important to cover (the im-
portance of empirical study and development of comprehensive, descriptive models).
And the book has covered this ground successfully, which will ensure its usefulness
both for future experimental study and for future implementations of questioning and
answering systems.
