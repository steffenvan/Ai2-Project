We explore the relation between word sense
subjectivity and cross-lingual lexical substitu-
tion, following the intuition that good substi-
tutions will transfer a word’s (contextual) sen-
timent from the source language into the target
language. Experiments on English-Chinese
lexical substitution show that taking a word’s
subjectivity into account can indeed improve
performance. We also show that just using
word sense subjectivity can perform as well
as integrating fully-fledged fine-grained word
sense disambiguation for words which have
both subjective and objective senses.

<bodyText confidence="0.999895625">
Cross-lingual lexical substitution has been proposed
as a Task at SemEval-2010.1 Given a target word
and its context in a source language (like English),
the goal is to provide correct translations for that
word in a target language (like Chinese). The trans-
lations must fit the given context.
In this paper, we explore the relation between the
sentiment of the used word in the source language
and translation choice in the target language, focus-
ing on English as the source and Chinese as the tar-
get language. Our work is motivated by the intuition
that most good word translations will be sentiment-
invariant, i.e. if a source word is used in a subjec-
tive (opinion-carrying) sense it will be often trans-
lated with a subjective sense in the target language
whereas if it used in an objective sense, it will be

translated with an objective sense. As an exam-
ple, consider the two words positive and collaborate
with example senses from WordNet 2.0 below.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999195375">
(1) positive—greater than zero; “positive numbers”
(objective)
(2) plus, positive—involving advantage or good; “a
plus (or positive) factor” (subjective)
(3) collaborate, join forces, cooperate—work together
on a common enterprise of project; “We joined
forces with another research group”(objective)
(4) collaborate—cooperate as a traitor; (subjective)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846227272727">
In most cases, if the word positive is used in
the sense “greater than zero” (objective) in an
English context, the corresponding Chinese trans-
lation is “✔ ✛”; if “involving advantage or
good”(subjective) is used, its Chinese translations
are “➮✹✛, ff✛”. Similarly, for the word collab-
orate, the sense “work together on a common en-
terprise of project” (objective) corresponds to “^G,
❾, ✍❾” in Chinese translation, and “cooperate as
a traitor” (subjective) corresponds to “✄✭, ❍✖
➃�”. Therefore, subjectivity information should
be effective for improving lexical translation for
what we previously (Su and Markert, 2008) termed
subjectivity-ambiguous words, i.e. words with both
subjective and objective senses such as positive and
collaborate above.
We therefore incorporate subjectivity word sense
disambiguation (SWSD) as defined in Akkaya et
al. (2009) into lexical substitution. SWSD is a
binary classification task that decides in context
whether a word occurs with one of its subjective or
one of its objective senses. In contrast to standard

multi-class Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), it
uses a coarse-grained sense inventory that allows to
achieve higher accuracy than WSD and therefore in-
troduces less noise when embedded in another task
such as word translation. For example, the accuracy
reported in Akkaya et al. (2009) for SWSD is over
20% higher than for standard WSD. Coarse-grained
senses are also easier to annotate, so getting train-
ing data for learning is less arduous. On the mi-
nus side, SWSD can only be useful for subjectivity-
ambiguous words. However, we showed (Su and
Markert, 2008) that subjectivity-ambiguity is fre-
quent (around 30% of common words).

McCarthy and Navigli (2007) organized a monolin-
gual English lexical substitution task in Semeval-
2007, i.e finding English substitutions for an English
target word. Mihalcea et al. organize an English-
Spanish lexical substitution task in SemEval-2010.
Approaches to lexical substitution in the past com-
petitions did not use sentiment features.
Independent of these lexical substitution tasks, the
connection between word senses and word transla-
tion has been explored in Chan et al. (2007) and
Carpuat and Wu (2007), who predict the probabil-
ities of a target word being translated as an item in
a “sense inventory”, where the sense inventory is a
list of possible translations. They then incorporate
these probabilities into machine translation. How-
ever, they do not consider sentiment explicitly.
Subjectivity at the word sense level has been
discussed by (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Su and
Markert, 2008; Akkaya et al., 2009). Wiebe and
Mihalcea (2006) and Su and Markert (2008) both
show that this is a well-defined concept via human
annotation as well as automatic recognition. Akkaya
et al. (2009) show that subjectivity word sense dis-
ambiguation (SWSD) can boost the performance of
a sentiment analysis system. None of these paper
considers the impact of word sense subjectivity on
cross-lingual lexical substitution.

3 Methodology

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999687">
3.1 Task and Dataset
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999953">
We constructed an English-Chinese lexical substi-
tution gold standard by translating the English tar-
get words in the SENSEVAL 2 and SENSEVAL 3
lexical sample training and test sets into Chinese.
We choose the SENSEVAL datasets as they are rel-
atively domain-independent and also because we
can use them for our SWSD/WSD subtasks as well.
The translation is carried out by two native Chinese
speakers with a good command of English. First,
candidate Chinese translations (denoted by T) of the
English target words are provided from the on-line
English-Chinese dictionary iciba2, which is com-
posed of more than 150 different English-Chinese
dictionaries. To reduce annotation bias, the order
of the Senseval sentences is randomized. The an-
notators then independently assign the most fitting
Chinese translation(s) (from T) for the English tar-
get words in the given Senseval sentences. For the
agreement study, different Chinese translations (for
example, “✙✪” and “✒❒” of the word author-
ity) that are actually synonyms are merged. The
observed agreement between the two annotators is
86.7%. Finally, the two annotators discuss the dis-
agreed examples together, leading to a gold stan-
dard.
Since we evaluate how word sense subjectivity
affects cross-lingual lexical substitution, we lim-
ited our study to the SENSEVAL words that are
subjectivity-ambiguous. Therefore, following the
annotation schemes in (Su and Markert, 2008;
Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), all senses of all target
words in SENSEVAL 2&amp;3 are annotated by a near-
native English speaker as subjective orobjective.
This annotator was not involved in the English to
Chinese translation. We also discard subjectivity-
ambiguous words if its subjective or objective senses
do not appear in both training and test set. In total we
collect 28 subjectivity-ambiguous words. Their En-
glish example sentences and translations yield 2890
training sentence pairs and 1444 test sentence pairs.

For the English-Chinese lexical substitution task, we
first develop a basic system (called B) to assign Chi-
nese translations to the target English words in con-
text. This system uses only standard contextual fea-
tures from the English sentences (see Section 3.3).
We then add word sense subjectivity information to

the basic system (see Section 3.4). We also compare
including word sense subjectivity to the inclusion of
full fine-grained sense information (Section 3.5).
All systems are supervised classifiers trained on
the SENSEVAL training data and evaluated on the
SENSEVAL test data for each of the 28 words. We
employ an SVM classifier from the libsvm pack-
age3 with a linear kernel.

<bodyText confidence="0.998685352941176">
In the basic system B, we adopt features which are
commonly used in WSD or lexical translation.
Surrounding Words: Lemmatized bag of words
with stop word filtering.
Part-of-Speech (POS): The POS of the neigh-
bouring words of the target word. We extract POS
tag of the 3 words to the right and left together with
position information.
Collocation: The neighbouring words of the tar-
get word. We extract 4 lemmatized words to the
right and left, together with position information.
Syntactic Relations: We employ the MaltParser4
for dependency parsing and extract 4 features: the
head word of the target word, POS of the head word,
the dependency relation between head word and tar-
get word, and the relative position (left or right) of
the head word to the target word.

binary subjective/objective labels. For a more re-
alistic assessment, we use SWSD to derive the sub-
jectivity sense label automatically (auto-subj) using
standard supervised binary SVMs and the features in

4 Experiments and Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942073170732">
For the English-Chinese lexical substitution task, we
evaluate 6 different methods: Baseline (assign the
most frequent translation to all examples), B (use
common features), B+gold subj (incorporate gold
standard word sense subjectivity), B+gold sense (in-
corporate gold standard sense), B+auto subj (incor-
porate automatically predicted word sense subjectiv-
ity), and B+auto sense (incorporate automatically
predicted fine-grained senses). We measure lexical
substitution accuracy on the SENSEVAL test data by
comparing to the human gold standard annotation
(see Section 3.1). Results are listed in Table 1.
Results. Table 1 shows that our standard lexical
substitution system B improves strongly (near 11%
average accuracy gain) over the most frequent trans-
lation baseline. Incorporating sense subjectivity as
in B+gold subj leads to a further strong improve-
ment, confirming our hypothesis that word sense
subjectivity can improve lexical substitution. Incor-
porating fine-grained senses B+gold senses yields
only a slightly higher gain, showing that a coarse-
grained subjective/objective classification might be
sufficient for subjectivity-ambiguous words for aid-
ing translation. In addition, the small gain using
fine-grained senses might disappear in practice as
automatic WSD is a more challenging task than
SWSD: in our experiment, B+auto sense performs
worse than B+auto subj. The current improve-
ment of B+auto subj over B is significant (McNe-
mar test at the 5% level). The difference between
the actual performance of word sense subjectivity
and its potential as exemplified in B+gold subj is,
obviously, caused by imperfect performance of the
SWSD component, mostly due to a distributional
bias in the SENSEVAL training data, with few ex-
amples for rarer senses of the target words.
For some words (such as authority and stress),
the additional sense subjectivity feature does not im-
prove lexical substitution, even when gold standard
labels are used. There are two main reasons for this.
First, one candidate Chinese translation might cover

both subjective and objective uses of the word. For
example, both the objective sense (“physics force
that produces strain on a physical body”) and sub-
jective senses (“dif�culty that causes worry or emo-
tional emotional tension” and “ a state of mental
or emotional strain or suspense” ) of stress are of-
ten translated as “F )7” in Chinese. Second, in
some cases, subjectivity word sense disambiguation
is too coarse-grained and finer-grained WSD is ac-
tually necessary. For example, the subjective usages
of authority in SENSEVAL examples are often trans-
lated as “❀❬, VX✪”, “❣✫” or “➀✫” (called
List-S), and objective usages are often translated
as “,N, H”,“✟N”,“VX)�, ❹VX” or “➬VX, ✶❖”
(called List-O). In this case, word sense subjectivity
might help to distinguish List-S from List-O, but
not among the candidate translations within a single

<bodyText confidence="0.9999852">
We tackle cross-lingual lexical substitution as a su-
pervised task, using sets of manual translations for a
target word as training data even for baseline system
B. However, we do not necessarily need dedicated
human translated data as we could also use existing
parallel texts in which the target word occurs. There-
fore, we think that a supervised approach to lexical
substitution is feasible. However, we do need addi-
tional monolingual sense-tagged data in the source
language for incorporating our word sense subjec-
tivity features.5 Although a disadvantage, more and
more sense-tagged data does become available (such
as OntoNotes). We also only need tagging at a
coarse-grained sense level, which is much easier to
create than fine-grained data.

We investigate the relation between word sense sub-
jectivity and cross-lingual lexical substitution. The
experimental results show that incorporating word
sense subjectivity into a standard supervised classi-
fication model yields a significantly better perfor-
mance for an English-Chinese lexical substitution
task. We also compare the effect of sense subjec-
tivity to the effect of fine-grained sense informa-
tion on lexical substitution. The differences be-
tween the two methods turn out to be small, mak-
ing a case for the “easier”, coarse-grained SWSD
over WSD for subjectivity-ambiguous words. Fu-
ture work will widen the study by (i) looking at a
wider range of words and languages, (ii) improv-
ing automatic SWSD results for better application
and (iii) integrating unsupervised subjectivity fea-
tures into cross-lingual lexical substitution.

For example, the accuracy reported in Akkaya et al. (2009) for SWSD is over 20% higher than for standard WSD. Coarse-grained senses are also easier to annotate, so getting training data for learning is less arduous. On the minus side, SWSD can only be useful for subjectivityambiguous words. However, we showed (Su and Markert, 2008) that subjectivity-ambiguity is frequent (around 30% of common words). 2 Related Work McCarthy and Navigli (2007) organized a monolingual English lexical substitution task in Semeval2007, i.e finding English substitutions for an English target word.

Similarly, for the word collaborate, the sense “work together on a common enterprise of project” (objective) corresponds to “^G, , ✍” in Chinese translation, and “cooperate as a traitor” (subjective) corresponds to “✄✭, ❍✖ �”. Therefore, subjectivity information should be effective for improving lexical translation for what we previously (Su and Markert, 2008) termed subjectivity-ambiguous words, i.e. words with both subjective and objective senses such as positive and collaborate above. We therefore incorporate subjectivity word sense disambiguation (SWSD) as defined in Akkaya et al. (2009) into lexical substitution. SWSD is a binary classification task that decides in context whether a word occurs with one of its subjective or one of its objective senses.

(2009) show that subjectivity word sense disambiguation (SWSD) can boost the performance of a sentiment analysis system. None of these paper considers the impact of word sense subjectivity on cross-lingual lexical substitution. 3 Methodology 3.1 Task and Dataset We constructed an English-Chinese lexical substitution gold standard by translating the English target words in the SENSEVAL 2 and SENSEVAL 3 lexi</context>

For the agreement study, different Chinese translations (for example, “✙✪” and “✒❒” of the word authority) that are actually synonyms are merged. The observed agreement between the two annotators is 86.7%. Finally, the two annotators discuss the disagreed examples together, leading to a gold standard. Since we evaluate how word sense subjectivity affects cross-lingual lexical substitution, we limited our study to the SENSEVAL words that are subjectivity-ambiguous. Therefore, following the annotation schemes in (Su and Markert, 2008; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), all senses of all target words in SENSEVAL 2&amp;3 are annotated by a nearnative English speaker as subjective orobjective. This annotator was not involved in the English to Chinese translation. We also discard subjectivityambiguous words if its subjective or objective senses do not appear in both training and test set. In total we collect 28 subjectivity-ambiguous words. Their English example sentences and translations yield 2890 training sentence pairs and 1444 test sentence pairs. 3.2 Algorithms For the English-Chinese lexical substitution task, we first develop a b</context>
