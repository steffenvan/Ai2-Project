Machine Translation (MT) research is thriving, and
papers on this and related topics nowadays often ac-
count for many of the papers read at meetings on
computational linguistics. The book reviewed here con-
sists of 16 papers on MT (plus an additional short paper
that summarizes some of the results of the conference)
presented at a gathering held in Budapest in August
1988. The theme of the conference, as stated by one of
the editors, was to &amp;quot;attempt to highlight some new
approaches and viewpoints against the background of
an up-to-date worldwide overview&amp;quot;. The 16 papers are
the following:

Against the background of the conference title, &amp;quot;New
Directions in Machine Translation&amp;quot; (which gives the
book its title), of the 16 papers, 4 seem to be irrelevant
to the topic (Winos, Piron, Weidmann, Blanke); of the
12 papers left, 3 report the state of various systems
(Zhen Dong, Oubine, Hutchins). That leaves only 9
papers original enough to be directly relevant to the
conference topic (Boitet, Kosaka, Guzman de Rojas,
Schubert, Hauenschild, Tsujii, Galinski, Sigurd,
Proszeky).
The 16 papers discuss the following topics; note that
most of them discuss more than one topic, but they all
put emphasis on one central topic:

The isolated papers of Winos in (i) and Piron in (viii)
above discuss the computer and translation from both
ends of the MT dimension. Winos, a computer scien-
Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 4, December 1989 265
Book Reviews New Directions in Machine Translation (Proceedings of the Conference, Budapest, August 1988)
tist, discusses how human activity is affected by the
computer revolution and the role of language in this
revolution. Indeed, anybody who works around a com-
puter, no matter where he or she stands with respect to
the computer, has to realize ultimately that natural
language is the link between humanity and the machine.
Vamos&apos;s contribution turns out to be interesting, for he
does not blindly praise the power of computers to help
human communication. His paper is about the social
and political responsibility of a society wherein comput-
ers are everyday tools. Piron&apos;s paper, on the other
hand, considers the specifics that make translation so
hard even for human translators. In the face of all the
problems, which make translators themselves prone to
mistakes, Piron—who acknowledges having no knowl-
edge of data processing and computers in general—
reiterates the doubts shared by most human translators
as to whether MT is feasible. How do MT developers
answer when facing Piron&apos;s typical attitude: &amp;quot;In order
to translate properly, you have to feel when and how to
switch from one atmosphere to another&amp;quot; (p. 236). If
feeling is a sine qua non condition for good translation,
then translation by machine must be ruled out, for a
computer does not feel. How can knowledge-based MT
developers hope to achieve anything of substantial
quality when a human translator admits not to know
why he does what he does: &amp;quot;But how do I know I
know? I don&apos;t know&amp;quot; (p. 236)? Many of Piron&apos;s objec-
tions (partly based on his unfamiliarity with how MT
systems function) do have answers; I hope Mr. Piron
was provided with some during the conference. Winos
and Piron&apos;s papers serve as useful reminders of the
relationships of MT to society and translation at large.
The state of the art reports in (ii) above briefly
describe various operational and research MT systems
developed in the USSR, China, Sweden, and Bolivia.
The first two have the properties of system reports; i.e.,
they describe in general terms the language-pairs
worked on, the higher programming languages, the
hardware, the grammars, and the MT approaches used.
Because of the descriptions being so general, it is
difficult at times to really understand what they mean;
however, this problem is inherent to systems reports.
While the other two papers in (ii) succinctly present
general information, they also discuss in some depth the
linguistic design or grammar of the respective systems
described (see (v) above). Even though dependency
grammar, or some modified version, is predominantly
represented, other MT system projects are integrating
other types of linguistic models, novel to the field: a
mathematical model (Guzman de Rojas), the Harris
operator–argument framework (Kosaka) and General-
ized Phrase Structure Grammar (Sigurd). Some papers
in (v) are more linguistic in nature. For instance,
Proszeky&apos;s paper on Hungarian shows why certain
linguistic properties make Hungarian more suitable to
be handled through an interlingua approach (more pre-
cisely, through the Distributed Language Translation
approach). Weidmann&apos;s paper discusses a version of
dependency grammar that he claims will construct a
possible universal &apos;blueprint&apos; for every sentence.
The transfer/interlingua debate ((iii) above) opens
with an illuminating paper by Boitet who clearly lays
out the gains and pitfalls of the two approaches. This
discussion is indirectly refined in Tsujii&apos;s paper where a
three-way definition of interlingua is proposed; one of
these definitions will have direct consequences for an
approach wherein discourse considerations are immedi-
ately taken into account in the processing of the linguis-
tic material. In this debate, Schubert&apos;s paper has the
merit of reminding MT developers that in practice a
system might have properties of both approaches; the
DLT system turns out to be &amp;quot;double direct&amp;quot;; i.e., direct
and interlingual.
Integrating the discourse dimension into an MT sys-
tem is discussed at the levels of implementation and of
theory (vi). In the SWETRA system (Sigurd&apos;s paper),
universal functional representations (UFRs) are used as
an intermediate (meta)language between languages. The
UFRs of successive sentences are stored so that the
system can keep track of the referents of a text for
appropriate use of pronouns, for example (p. 208). The
concern about developing MT systems sensitive to
discourse situation (in the broad sense) is at the origin of
Kosaka&apos;s sublanguage approach to MT. Techniques of
text analysis are used to identify information patterns of
a domain-specific language to disambiguate input. Most
importantly, this approach tends to be intermediate
between transfer and interlingua. Finally, Hauenschild
discusses the importance of discourse structure for
translation in general and MT, seen as a special case.
After looking at idiosyncrasies of how a language ex-
presses the thematic structure of a text, she argues in
favor of the transfer approach. However, she also
shows that invariants in translation should be captured
by an interlingual approach. The conclusion turns out to
be that a MT system should combine both approaches.
The aim of the conference was to illuminate the
question of the new directions MT is taking by bringing
together work from different perspectives. An introduc-
tion would have added much to the value of the book
and its coherence. In view of the many topics and the
new directions MT research and development are tak-
ing, the book would also have greatly benefitted from an
effort on the part of the editors to explain the presence
of some isolated papers (Vamos, Piron, etc), to bring
together the papers that belong together under some
sort of heading with introductory comments, and finally
to reorder the papers. For instance, why leave at the
end of the volume Sgall&apos;s closing remarks (which would
be helpful to the reader as an introduction to the
volume) where he draws conclusions about the material
presented under three categories: (1) binary translation
versus the intermediate language, (2) the linguistic
method, and (3) human and artificial intelligence.

Because of the descriptions being so general, it is difficult at times to really understand what they mean; however, this problem is inherent to systems reports. While the other two papers in (ii) succinctly present general information, they also discuss in some depth the linguistic design or grammar of the respective systems described (see (v) above). Even though dependency grammar, or some modified version, is predominantly represented, other MT system projects are integrating other types of linguistic models, novel to the field: a mathematical model (Guzman de Rojas), the Harris operator–argument framework (Kosaka) and Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Sigurd). Some papers in (v) are more linguistic in nature. For instance, Proszeky&apos;s paper on Hungarian shows why certain linguistic properties make Hungarian more suitable to be handled through an interlingua approach (more precisely, through the Distributed Language Translation approach). Weidmann&apos;s paper discusses a version of dependency grammar that he claims will construct a possible universal &apos;blueprint&apos; for every sentence. The transfer/interlingua debate ((iii) above) opens with an illuminating paper by Boitet who clearly lays out the gains and pitfalls of the two approaches. This discussion is indirectly refined in Tsujii&apos;s paper where a three-way definition of interlingua is proposed; one of these definitions will have direct consequences for an approach wherein discourse considerations are immediately taken into account in the processing of the linguistic material. In this debate, Schubert&apos;s paper has the merit of reminding MT developers that in practice a system might have properties of both approaches; the DLT system turns out to be &amp;quot;double direct&amp;quot;; i.e., direct and interlingual. Integrating the discourse dimension into an MT system is discussed at the levels of implementation and of theory (vi). In the SWETRA system (Sigurd&apos;s paper), universal functional representations (UFRs) are used as an intermediate (meta)language between languages. The UFRs of successive sentences are stored so that the system can keep track of the referents of a text for appropriate use of pronouns, for example (p. 208). The concern about developing MT systems sensitive to discourse situation (in the broad sense) is at the origin of Kosaka&apos;s sublanguage approach to MT. Techniques of text analysis are used to identify information patterns of a domain-specific language to disambiguate input. Most importantly, this approach tends to be intermediate between transfer and interlingua. Finally, Hauenschild discusses the importance of discourse structure for translation in general and MT, seen as a special case. After looking at idiosyncrasies of how a language expresses the thematic structure of a text, she argues in favor of the transfer approach. However, she also shows that invariants in translation should be captured by an interlingual approach. The conclusion turns out to be that a MT system should combine both approaches. The aim of the conference was to illuminate the question of the new directions MT is taking by bringing together work from different perspectives. An introduction would have added much to the value of the book and its coherence. In view of the many topics and the new directions MT research and development are taking, the book would also have greatly benefitted from an effort on the part of the editors to explain the presence of some isolated papers (Vamos, Piron, etc), to bring together the papers that belong together under some sort of heading with introductory comments, and finally to reorder the papers. For instance, why leave at the end of the volume Sgall&apos;s closing remarks (which would</abstract>
