Abstract

We present our participation in Task 7 of
SemEval shared task 2014. The goal of
this particular task includes the identifica-
tion of disorder named entities and the
mapping of each disorder to a unique Uni-
fied Medical Language System concept
identifier, which were referred to as Task
A and Task B respectively. We partici-
pated in both of these subtasks and used
YTEX as a baseline system. We further
developed a supervised linear chain Con-
ditional Random Field model based on
sets of features to predict disorder men-
tions. To take benefit of results from both
systems we merged these results. Under
strict condition our best run evaluated at
0.549 F-measure for Task A and an accu-
racy of 0.489 for Task B on test dataset.
Based on our error analysis we conclude
that recall of our system can be signifi-
cantly increased by adding more features
to the Conditional Random Field model
and by using another type of tag represen-
tation or frame matching algorithm to deal
with the disjoint entity mentions.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.991263">
Clinical notes are rich sources of valuable pa-
tient’s information. These clinical notes are often
plain text records containing important entity
mentions such as clinical findings, procedures and
disease mentions (Jimeno et al., 2008). Using au-
tomated tools to extract the aforementioned infor-
mation can undoubtedly help researchers and cli-
nicians with better decision making. An important
subtask of information extraction called named
entity recognition (NER) can recognize the
boundary of named entity mention and classify it
into a certain semantic group.
The focus of the SemEval-2104 task 7 is recogni-
tion and normalization of disorder entities men-
tioned in clinical notes. As such, this task was fur-
ther divided into two parts: first, task A which in-
cludes recognition of mention of concepts that be-
long to UMLS (Unified Medical Language Sys-
tem) semantic group disorders (Bodenreider,
2004). The concepts considered in Task A include
the following eleven UMLS semantic types: Con-
genital Abnormality; Acquired Abnormality; In-
jury or Poisoning; Pathologic Function; Disease
or Syndrome; Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;
Cell or Molecular Dysfunction; Experimental
Model of Disease; Anatomical Abnormality; Ne-
oplastic Process; and Signs and Symptoms. Sec-
ond, task B referred to as task of normalization in-
volves the mapping of each disorder mention to a
UMLS concept unique identifier (CUI).The map-
ping was limited to UMLS CUI of SNOMED clin-
ical term codes (Spackman, Campbell, &amp; CÃ,
1997). We participated in both tasks and devel-

2.1 System Design
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991047619048">
For both task A and B, YTEX (Garla et al.,
2011) system was employed as a baseline system.
We chose to use YTEX since it is specifically de-
signed for processing clinical notes with improve-
ments to cTAKES’s dictionary lookup algorithm
and word sense disambiguation feature. The pre-
processing involves sentence detection, tokeniza-
tion and part-of-speech (POS) tagging(Fiscus,
1997). Based on the tokenized tokens, several fea-
tures along with the corresponding part-of-speech
tags were extracted for the supervised learning al-
gorithm–conditional random field (CRF) model
(Lafferty, McCallum, &amp; Pereira, 2001). After
training, the CRF model was used for recognizing
disorder mentions. Furthermore the recognized
disorder concepts were sent to MetaMap
(Aronson &amp; Lang, 2010) to look for their corre-
sponding CUIs for generating normalized results.
The results were finally merged with the output of
YTEX. A high level diagram of the developed
system is schematized in Figure 1.

2.2 Disorder Concept Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944130434782">
The task A involves detecting boundaries of en-
tity that belongs to UMLS semantic group, disor-
ders. We used the sequence tagging tool based on
Mallet’s implementation of the supervised linear
chain CRF model to perform this task. We fol-
lowed the traditional BIO format to formulate the
disorder concept recognition task as a sequential
labelling task, wherein each token was assigned a
label such as B is indicated the Beginning of en-
tity, I is indicated the Inside an entity, or O is in-
dicated the Outside of an entity. Thus, the model
assigns each of the word into one of the above
three labels. We investigated various types of fea-
tures proposed in previous works (Jiang et al.,
2011; Li, Kipper-Schuler, &amp; Savova, 2008; Tang,
Cao, Wu, Jiang, &amp; Xu, 2013), like semantic fea-
ture which includes UMLS semantic group and
semantic type, to develop our classifier. We also
investigated various word features like POS, cap-
italization, and ‘position of word’ in the sentence.
We also used ‘previous word’, ‘next word’ and
‘label of these words’ as a feature for developing
our classifier.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.971791">
2.3 Disorder Concept Normalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951">
Each disorder concept recognized by our recogni-
tion system was passed to a local installation of
MetaMap using MetaMap Java API to obtain its
candidate CUI. To increase the recall, we merged
results from both YTEX and MetaMap systems.
Output from YTEX baseline system was merged
to the output from our CRF model with MetaMap.
This method was used because it was observed
that our CRF/MetaMap model has higher preci-
sion while YTEX baseline system has higher re-
call.

3.1 Datasets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998627571428571">
For Task A and Task B, the training and devel-
opment datasets provided by the SemEval task 7
organizers were used. Both were derived from
ShARe corpus containing de-identified plain text
clinical notes from MIMIC II database (Suominen
et al., 2013). These clinical notes were manually
annotated for disorder mention and normalized to

<bodyText confidence="0.999904727272727">
an UMLS CUI when possible. The corpus con-
sisted of four types of clinical notes: discharge
summaries, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram,
and radiology reports. As the dataset, we included
different types of clinical notes, further we trained
a CRF model for each type and evaluated its per-
formance on the corresponding development data.
However, test set from task organizers contained
discharge summaries only. Hence, the model de-
veloped for discharge summary was selected for
evaluation on the test set.

3.2 Evaluation Metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929538461538">
The official evaluation script provided by or-
ganizers of the shared task was used to evaluate
our system ability to correct an identify spans of
text that belongs to semantic group disorders and
to normalize them to the corresponding CUIs.
We calculated the evaluation measures under
two settings-strict and relaxed. The strict setting
matches exact boundaries with the gold standard,
while relaxed setting matches overlapping bound-
aries in the gold standard. The evaluation
measures were calculated using the commonly
used evaluation measures including recall (R),
precision (P), and F-measure (F) (Powers, 2007).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9968">
3.3 System Configurations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984071428572">
We used YTEX V0.8 with cTAKES V2.5.0 as
the baseline system for performance comparison.
All default settings for YTEX, including the con-
cept window of the length 10, were adopted. We
submit two runs for both tasks. For Task A, the
first run, denoted as Run0, used the developed
CRF model to recognize the disorder concepts.
The second run was denoted as Run1, which
merged the results of CRF model with YTEX.
Similarly, for Task B, Run0 used the MetaMap
2012 version to normalize the candidate disorder
concepts recognized by our CRF model. For
Run1, we merged normalized annotation results
of YTEX with Run0.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980549">
3.4 System Performance Comparison
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974571428571">
We performed a ten-fold cross validation on
the combination of the training and development
datasets for examining the recognition and nor-
malization performance of the developed CRF
model combined with MetaMap (Run0), and com-
pared with the YTEX as the baseline system. Ta-
ble 1 summarized the results for Task A and B.
The results showed, for both tasks, Run0 sig-
nificantly outperformed YTEX in the strict setting.
The higher F-score of Run0 can be attributed by
the fact that Run0 is developed based on the re-
leased corpus and the machine learning algorithm
which is better suited for NER task as compared
to the rule based YTEX system. In the relaxed set-
ting, for Task A, Run0 also has significantly
higher F-score than the YTEX baseline system.
However, in case of Task B accuracy of YTEX is
significantly greater than Run0. We believe that
the higher accuracy of the baseline system can be
attributed by the word sense disambiguation fea-
ture within YTEX.

Table 2 shows that Run1 has higher F-score
than Run0 because of its high recall. On the other
hand, Run0 achieves significantly higher preci-
sion compared to Run1 for Task A. The result is
in accordance with our expectation, because Run1
integrated the results from YTEX to improve the
recall of Run0 at the cost of the decrease in preci-
sion. The trade-off seems acceptable because it
can significantly improve the accuracy in normal-
izing disorder concepts.

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989448">
We performed error analysis on development da-
taset and found that the lower recall of Run0 de-
rived from the miss of many disjoint entities
(where the tokens comprising the entity string are
non-adjacent), which cannot be captured by the
current BIO tag set. For example, consider the
sentence “Abdomen is soft, nontender, non-
distended, negative bruits.” For this sentence the
gold annotations contain three entities as “Abdo-
men bruits-CUI= C0221755”, “Abdomen
nontender-CUI=CUI-less” and “nondistended-
CUI=CUI-less”. In the current BIO formulation,
all of the above three disjoint entities cannot be
correctly recognized. There are also abbreviations
which were rarely seen in the training dataset but
appeared more in the development/test sets. So
when we test our developed model on test set the
abbreviations which are not part of training and
development set must have been missed by our
system. We believe that by incorporating medical
abbreviations database into our model develop-
ment, the performance of our overall system
would have been better. Also, the precision in
Task A of Run1 was lower than Run0 because of
some disjoint annotations.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991846153846">
We present a clinical NER system based on Mal-
let’s implementation of CRF and a hybrid normal-
ization system using MetaMap and YTEX. We
developed our system with limited features due to
the time constraint. We can conclude from error
analysis that recall of this system could be signif-
icantly increased by adding more features to it.
We plan to extend our system in future by using
another type of tag representation or frame-based
pattern matching algorithm to handle disjoint
named entities. Similarly missing abbreviations
can be handled by employing external resources
such as abbreviation recognition tools.

These clinical notes are often plain text records containing important entity mentions such as clinical findings, procedures and disease mentions (Jimeno et al., 2008). Using automated tools to extract the aforementioned information can undoubtedly help researchers and clinicians with better decision making. An important subtask of information extraction called named entity recognition (NER) can recognize the boundary of named entity mention and classify it into a certain semantic group. The focus of the SemEval-2104 task 7 is recognition and normalization of disorder entities mentioned in clinical notes. As such, this task was further divided into two parts: first, task A which includes recognition of mention of concepts that belong to UMLS (Unified Medica</context>

We calculated the evaluation measures under two settings-strict and relaxed. The strict setting matches exact boundaries with the gold standard, while relaxed setting matches overlapping boundaries in the gold standard. The evaluation measures were calculated using the commonly used evaluation measures including recall (R), precision (P), and F-measure (F) (Powers, 2007). 3.3 System Configurations We used YTEX V0.8 with cTAKES V2.5.0 as the baseline system for performance comparison. All default settings for YTEX, including the concept window of the length 10, were adopted. We submit two runs for both tasks. For Task A, the first run, denoted as Run0, used the developed CRF model to recognize the disorder concepts. The second run was denoted as Run1, which merged the results of CRF model with YTEX. Similarly, for Task B, Run0 used the MetaMap 2012 version to normalize the candidate disorder concepts recognized by our CRF model. For Run1, we merged normalized </context>

To increase the recall, we merged results from both YTEX and MetaMap systems. Output from YTEX baseline system was merged to the output from our CRF model with MetaMap. This method was used because it was observed that our CRF/MetaMap model has higher precision while YTEX baseline system has higher recall. 3 Results 3.1 Datasets For Task A and Task B, the training and development datasets provided by the SemEval task 7 organizers were used. Both were derived from ShARe corpus containing de-identified plain text clinical notes from MIMIC II database (Suominen et al., 2013). These clinical notes were manually annotated for disorder mention and normalized to 664 an UMLS CUI when possible. The corpus consisted of four types of clinical notes: discharge summaries, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and radiology reports. As the dataset, we included different types of clinical notes, further we trained a CRF model for each type and evaluated its performance on the corresponding development data. However, test set from task organizers contained discharge summaries only. Hence, the model developed for discharge summary was selected for evaluation on the test set. 3.2 </context>
