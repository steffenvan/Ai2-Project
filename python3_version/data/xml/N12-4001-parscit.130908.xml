ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999900157894737">
Many NLP tasks have at their core a subtask of extracting the dependencies---who did
what to whom---from natural language sentences. This task can be understood as the
inverse of the problem solved in different ways by diverse human languages, namely,
how to indicate the relationship between different parts of a sentence. Understanding
how languages solve the problem can be extremely useful in both feature design and
error analysis in the application of machine learning to NLP. Likewise, understanding
cross-linguistic variation can be important for the design of MT systems and other
multilingual applications. The purpose of this tutorial is to present in a succinct and
accessible fashion information about the structure of human languages that can be
useful in creating more linguistically sophisticated, more language independent, and
thus more successful NLP systems.
While many kinds of linguistic structure can be relevant to different NLP tasks, the focus
of this tutorial will be on morphosyntax. The tutorial will take an explicitly typological
perspective as an understanding of cross-linguistic variation can facilitate the design of
more portable (language-independent) NLP systems. In order to help participants retain
the information better, the tutorial will be structured interactively. I will ask participants
for examples of tasks and data sets they work with, and then as a group we will
brainstorm ways in which each of the linguistic properties discussed can related to
feature design and/or error analysis for those tasks.

Emily M. Bender is an Associate Professor in the Department of Linguistics and Adjunct
Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the
University of Washington. Her primary research interests lie in multilingual grammar
engineering and the incorporation of linguistic knowledge, especially from linguistic
typology, in NLP. She is the PI of the Grammar Matrix project, which is developed in the
context of the DELPH-IN Consortium (Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG Initiative).
More generally, she is interested in the intersection of linguistics and computational
linguistics, from both directions: bringing computational methodologies to linguistic
science and linguistic science to natural language processing.
Her PhD (in Linguistics) is from Stanford University. She has authored or co-authored
papers in Linguistic Issues in Language Technology, the Journal of Research on
Language and Computation, English Language and Linguistics, the Encyclopedia of
Language and Linguistics, and the proceedings of ACL, COLING, IJCNLP and
associated workshops.
