defect and may occasionally produce an inadequate
parse-forest representation.
It is claimed in the book that the algorithm described
&amp;quot;is more efficient than any existing general parsing
algorithms in terms of recognition time as far as practi-
cal natural language grammars are concerned&amp;quot; (p. 73).
The crucial point about this statement is, obviously, the
notion of &amp;quot;practical natural language grammars&amp;quot;. As
mentioned before, Tomita&apos;s algorithm is intended for a
subset of context-free grammars. In particular, it is not
able to handle cyclic grammars, e.g.:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6824235">
S—s. S
—&gt; X
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9957805">
and turns out to be less efficient than Earley&apos;s algorithm
with &amp;quot;densely&amp;quot; ambiguous grammars, such as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8741815">
S —&gt; SSSS
S SSS
S —&gt; SS
S X
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999376166666667">
Although it seems unlikely that any natural-language
grammar contains cyclic rules or dense ambiguities, the
limitations of Tomita&apos;s algorithm with regard to natural-
language grammars remain somewhat unclear.
The major arguments for the usefulness of the algo-
rithm are, therefore, empirical. Both Tomita&apos;s and
Earley&apos;s algorithms have been implemented and tested
against various grammars and sentences. The grammar
of English most used in the experiment has about 220
rules, and the set of test sentences is made up of both
actual and invented examples, more than 50 in number.
The results of the experiment show that Tomita&apos;s algo-
rithm is significantly faster than Earley&apos;s algorithm in
practical applications. Moreover, its parsing time and
space remain tractable when the length of an input
sentence, the number of parses, or the size of a gram-
mar increases.
The book is composed of 10 chapters and several
appendices. Chapters 1 through 6, apart from some
introductory remarks, provide an informal description
of the algorithm, illustrated with plenty of clear exam-
ples; a formal specification (which is not necessary,
however, to understand how the algorithm works); a
comparison of Tomita&apos;s algorithm with other context-
free parsing algorithms; and finally a description of the
experiment mentioned above. The appendices give,
among other things, the correctness proof of the algo-
rithm, as well as programs, grammars, and test sen-
tences used in the experiment.
Chapters 7, 8, and 9 constitute a relatively indepen-
dent part of the book. They suggest some practical
applications of Tomita&apos;s algorithm, such as left-to-right
on-line parsing, interactive sentence disambiguation by
asking the user for the preferred interpretation of the
sentence in question, and interactive machine transla-
tion of small documents, letters, etc. To a wide circle of
readers involved in computational linguistics, this part
of the book may be even more interesting than the
others. The core of the book, on the contrary, seems to
be of great importance for those who deal in practice
with natural-language parsing rather than those who
observe the advances in this field from the outside.

Editor&apos;s note: Frequently, the need has been felt for a longer
treatment of books that on the one hand do not warrant a full
review, but on the other hand merit more than a bare
appearance in the list of books received. Often, such books
are those that are important in related fields such as theoret-
ical linguistics and will be reviewed in the appropriate jour-
nals, but which may have relevance to computational linguis-
tics as well. Sometimes, it is simply the case that a mere listing
by title and author does not convey enough information to let
the reader know whether the book may be in their area of
interest. In addition, popular works or books of oblique
interest to the field may merit a brief notice.
This new section will answer this need by giving brief
notices of books. Most often, books appearing in this section
will not have a review per se; rather, just a summary of the
book will usually be given—based on that of the author or
publisher, in the case of monographs, or through the table of
contents in the case of collections. Such a treatment reflects
the book review editor&apos;s judgment that the book is worthy of
attention, but is not necessarily an endorsement of the con-
tent. Short opinions may also be given in some cases, where
the nature of the book calls for an evaluation but not a full
review.

On the Definition of Word develops a consistent and
coherent approach to central questions about morphology
and its relation to syntax. In sorting out the various senses
in which the word word is used, it asserts that three
concepts that have often been identified with each other
are in fact distinct and not coextensive: listemes (linguistic
objects permanently stored by the speaker), morphological
objects (objects whose shape can be characterized in mor-
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 81

phological terms of affixation and compounding), and
syntactic atoms (objects that are unanalyzable units with
respect to syntax).
The first chapter defends the idea that listemes are
distinct from the other two notions and that all one can and
should say about them is that they exist. A theory of
morphological objects is developed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3
defends the claim that morphological objects are a proper
subset of the syntactic atoms, presenting the authors&apos;
reconstruction of the important and much-debated Lexical
Integrity Hypothesis. A final chapter shows that there are
syntactic atoms that are not morphological objects.

The aim of this book is to make available, in a readily
accessible form, bibliographic information about the vast
majority of 1980s publications in the field of natural-
language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics.
To this end, it contains 1764 numbered references to papers
and books in the field published (or republished) since
January 1980. These references are ordered alphabetically
by first author, so if you know the identity of the first
author of the item that you are trying to chase down, then
you can look it up directly. There is, in addition, art index
of subsidiary authors that lists, for each such author, the
numbers of the papers on which that author appears as a
second or subsequent author.
If your concern is to access papers by topic, rather than
by author, then this book provides an extensive keyword-
in-context (KWIC) index based on the titles of all the
papers. No bibliography of an active and diverse interdis-
ciplinary research area can lay claim to full comprehensive-
ness. Our aim has been to exhaustively cover the core
sources in the field and to augment the result with as many
items from other sources as we could readily lay our hands
on. We have excluded from our remit unpublished papers,
dissertations, and technical reports containing only papers
by authors based at the issuing institution. The core of the
bibliography consists of all the papers in the journal Com-
putational Linguistics, all the books and papers in books
published in the ACL (Association for Computational
Linguistics) book series &amp;quot;Studies in Natural Language
Processing&amp;quot;, all the papers republished in Readings in
Natural Language Processing (1986, edited by Grosz,
Sparck Jones, and Webber), all the papers to be found in
the conference proceedings volumes of ACL, European
ACL, COLING, TINLAP (Theoretical Issues in Natural
Language Processing) and TANLU (Theoretical Aspects
of Natural Language Understanding), together with all the
papers on natural-language processing to be found in the
journals Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelli-
gence, and in the conference proceedings volumes of
AAAI (American Association for Artificial Intelligence),
AISB (Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and
the Simulation of Behaviour), ECAI (European Confer-
ence on Artificial Intelligence), and IJCAI (International
Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence).
This core has been augmented by individual papers
drawn from numerous journals, conference and workshop
proceedings, ad hoc publications, the contents of most of
the edited collections on NLP, and by the rather few texts
and monographs that we know to have been published on
the topic. In selecting non-core items for inclusion, . . .we
have used the question, &amp;quot;Would the editor of Computa-
tional Linguistics consider this paper a relevant submission
to the journal?&amp;quot; as a very rough guide for deciding whether
or not to include details of a paper.
The bibliography source files are now kept on-line at
Stanford University and can be accessed by computer mail
by people with access to the relevant academic network.
Send computer mail to clbib@russell.stanford.edu with the

This bibliography is an ongoing enterprise—the com-
puter version will be kept up to date, and it is anticipated
that there will be subsequent editions of this book.
—From the introduction
Is the literature of computational linguistics now so large that
we need guides to help search it? Gazdar et al.&apos;s book shows
that it is and we do. Of course, one could wish for more than
the guide provides—like the full abstract of each item and a
complete index of concepts—but that might be asking a bit too
much just yet. This bibliography will be an enormous help to
any serious researcher in the field, for, by definition, anyone
who doesn&apos;t find it useful can&apos;t be called a serious researcher
in the field. —G.H.

Research in transformational syntax. . . has assumed, for
the most part, that it is reasonably clear what a phrase
marker is. During the last five to ten years, as syntactic
theory has become noticeably more sophisticated, there
has been an increasing number of allusions in the literature
to the possibility that it is, in fact, not so clear what a
phrase marker is, and that perhaps our usual conception of
these objects is wrong. . . .
This book attempts to tackle these issues head-on, by
giving a detailed formalization of a revised definition of
phrase markers. This revision allows phrase markers to
contain &amp;quot;parallel structures&amp;quot; of a type not countenanced in
customary definitions.

The chapters in this volume were developed from material
presented at a conference held at The University of Chi-
cago in July 1985. The point of this conference was to
provide a forum for the exchange of ideas concerning the
role, if any, of discontinuous constituency in grammar.
There was no attempt to exclude or promote particular
theoretical orientations or to restrict the scope of inquiry.
The volume contains contributions . . . from a variety of
perspectives, including Government-Binding Theory, Gen-
eralized and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Dis-
course Representation Theory, Autolexical Syntax, and
Tree Adjoining Grammar. While the volume . . . does not
pretend to survey all relevant work in this area, the
chapters included clearly suggest both the dimensions of
the problem and the sorts of solutions currently available.

The papers in this volume emerged from a workshop on
Morphology/Syntax/Discourse Interactions, held in Sum-
mer 1985 at the Center for the Study of Language and
Information (CSLI), Stanford University. The participants
included students and faculty from the Stanford and Berke-
ley Linguistics Departments, as well as several CSLI
researchers.
Presentations given in the workshop offered insight into
how different components of grammar work together, and
demonstrated, moreover, that specific linguistic phenom-
ena receive more interesting accounts when viewed as the
result of interplay between components. The papers in-
cluded in the volume are refined and augmented versions of
the material originally presented in the workshop.

This book is an introduction to that part of logic of most
interest to linguists and philosophers of language. Quite
generally, formal semantics is the study of meaning for
formal languages defined and explored by means of set

reader to a point from which he or she may easily read and
evaluate ordinary research in formal semantics. The book
is also a good introduction to standard logic and to more
specialized textbooks on modal logic, Montague grammar,
and philosophical logic.
Propositional and first-order logic are treated separately,
including for each its syntax, natural deduction and proof
theory, and formal semantics with Henkin-style complete-
ness proofs. The nine chapters of the book divide into
groups of three, each suitable for a quarter-length course.
Standard logic is fully covered in the first two-thirds of the
volume. The final section is suitable for a more advanced
course in philosophical logic.

Michael McTear&apos;s book The Articulate Computer is not
addressed to researchers in computational linguistics, but they
will find it useful, anyway, as a book to recommend to
outsiders who want to know more about the field. Although it
is an introduction to natural-language processing, it is not a
textbook. Rather, it is addressed to readers in neighboring
disciplines, and, indeed, intelligent lay readers, who want to
know more about the field, its successes, its issues, and its
problems, without the technical density or pedagogical style
of a textbook. That is not to say that McTear shies away from
technical detail; on the contrary, the book contains plenty of
it, and goes quite deeply into many issues. But it is detail to
produce thorough understanding, not to teach the reader to
write their own programs. Only a minimal knowledge of
linguistics and computing is assumed.
McTear&apos;s presentation is comprehensive; he covers the
early history of the field, syntax, semantics, issues in knowl-
edge representation, and problems in extended discourse—
McTear&apos;s own area of research. This book would be an
excellent starting point for anyone in other areas of AI or
cognitive science who wants to know more about computa-
tional linguistics but feels hesitant about tackling the technical
literature straight off.

This work presents the first sustained examination of
Dependency Syntax. In clear and stimulating analyses
Mel &apos;6uk promotes syntactic description in terms of depen-
dency rather than in terms of more familiar phrase-struc-
ture. The notions of dependency relations and dependency
structure are introduced and substantiated, and the advan-
tages of dependency representation are demonstrated by
applying it to a number of popular linguistic problems, e.g.,
grammatical subject and ergative construction. A wide
array of linguistic data is used—the well-known (Dyirbal),
the less known (Lezgian), and the more recent (Alutor).
Several &amp;quot;exotic&amp;quot; cases of Russian are discussed to show
how dependency can be used to solve difficult technical
problems.
The book is not only formal and rigorous, but also
strongly theory-oriented and data-based. Special attention
is paid to linguistic terminology, specifically to its logical
consistency. The dependency formalism is presented
within the framework of a new semantics-oriented general
linguistic theory, Meaning-Text theory.

Based on extensive empirical research, this work ad-
dresses questions of how the grammar—in its wider sense
of the syntax, vocabulary, and phonology—of naturally
occurring texts signals higher-order semantic structures.
Part I focuses attention on issues of general interest,
illustrated with specific examples, including the structure
of technical discourse, the role of time expressions in
English, the pragmatics of reasoning and causality, and of
utterance functions. Part II contains discussions of causal
ordering and adverbial usage based on a major machine-
readable corpus, an examination of the development of
conversational skills in children, and a report on an exper-
iment on reference. In Part III, the emphasis is on cross-
language matters. Here are textual insights into the prob-
lems of English-Arabic translation, of English-German
bilingual dictionaries, of reference in the translations of
novels, and finally a discussion of the various types of
errors language learners make, with examples drawn from
a wide variety of language systems.

acquired from research into human-computer interaction
with those at the sharp end of the design process, princi-
pally the systems engineers and programmers. If effective
interactive products are to be built and sold, all personnel
involved in the design process must be aware of the basic
principles involved: it is not enough to simply consult a
specialist when problems arise.

Unfortunately, the book&apos;s own user interface leaves some-
thing to be desired. The text is reproduced from copy run off
on a daisy-wheel printer. Although the print quality is good,
the text is right-justified without hyphenated word breaks.
This results in large spaces between words, making the text
difficult to follow with the eye, especially as the lines are
unleaded. Thus the book violates the most basic rules of text
design (e.g., Chicago 1982: 567-569; Craig 1980: 127-131).
This is rather surprising in a book concerned with human
factors, especially as one of the chapters (Hulme&apos;s) is largely
concerned with factors in the legibility of printed text.

It is claimed in the book that the algorithm described &amp;quot;is more efficient than any existing general parsing algorithms in terms of recognition time as far as practical natural language grammars are concerned&amp;quot; (p. 73). The crucial point about this statement is, obviously, the notion of &amp;quot;practical natural language grammars&amp;quot;. As mentioned before, Tomita&apos;s algorithm is intended for a subset of context-free grammars. In particular, it is not able to handle cyclic grammars, e.g.: S—s. S and turns out to be less efficient than Earley&apos;s algorithm with &amp;quot;densely&amp;quot; ambiguous grammars, such as:</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.994622285714285">Although it seems unlikely that any natural-language grammar contains cyclic rules or dense ambiguities, the limitations of Tomita&apos;s algorithm with regard to naturallanguage grammars remain somewhat unclear. The major arguments for the usefulness of the algorithm are, therefore, empirical. Both Tomita&apos;s and Earley&apos;s algorithms have been implemented and tested against various grammars and sentences. The grammar of English most used in the experiment has about 220 rules, and the set of test sentences is made up of both actual and invented examples, more than 50 in number. The results of the experiment show that Tomita&apos;s algorithm is significantly faster than Earley&apos;s algorithm in practical applications. Moreover, its parsing time and space remain tractable when the length of an input sentence, the number of parses, or the size of a grammar increases. The book is composed of 10 chapters and several appendices. Chapters 1 through 6, apart from some introductory remarks, provide an informal description of the algorithm, illustrated with plenty of clear examples; a formal specification (which is not necessary, however, to understand how the algorithm works); a comparison of Tomita&apos;s algorithm with other contextfree parsing algorithms; and finally a description of the experiment mentioned above. The appendices give, among other things, the correctness proof of the algorithm, as well as programs, grammars, and test sentences used in the experiment. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 constitute a relatively independent part of the book. They suggest some practical applications of Tomita&apos;s algorithm, such as left-to-right on-line parsing, interactive sentence disambiguation by asking the user for the preferred interpretation of the sentence in question, and interactive machine translation of small documents, letters, etc. To a wide circle of readers involved in computational linguistics, this part of the book may be even more interesting than the others. The core of the book, on the contrary, seems to be of great importance for those who deal in practice with natural-language parsing rather than those who observe the advances in this field from the outside.</abstract>

BRIEFLY NOTED note: the need has been felt for a longer treatment of books that on the one hand do not warrant a full review, but on the other hand merit more than a bare appearance in the list of books received. Often, such books are those that are important in related fields such as theoretical linguistics and will be reviewed in the appropriate journals, but which may have relevance to computational linguistics as well. Sometimes, it is simply the case that a mere listing by title and author does not convey enough information to let the reader know whether the book may be in their area of interest. In addition, popular works or books of oblique interest to the field may merit a brief notice. This new section will answer this need by giving brief notices of books. Most often, books appearing in this section will not have a review per se; rather, just a summary of the book will usually be given—based on that of the author or publisher, in the case of monographs, or through the table of contents in the case of collections. Such a treatment reflects the book review editor&apos;s judgment that the book is worthy of but is not necessarily an endorsement of the content. Short opinions may also be given in some cases, where the nature of the book calls for an evaluation but not a full review.</abstract>

A theory of morphological objects is developed in Chapter 2.

To this end, it contains 1764 numbered references to papers and books in the field published (or republished) since January 1980. These references are ordered alphabetically by first author, so if you know the identity of the first author of the item that you are trying to chase down, then you can look it up directly. There is, in addition, art index of subsidiary authors that lists, for each such author, the numbers of the papers on which that author appears as a second or subsequent author. If your concern is to access papers by topic, rather than author, then this book provides an extensive keywordindex based on the titles of all the papers. No bibliography of an active and diverse interdisciplinary research area can lay claim to full comprehensiveness. Our aim has been to exhaustively cover the core sources in the field and to augment the result with as many items from other sources as we could readily lay our hands on. We have excluded from our remit unpublished papers, dissertations, and technical reports containing only papers by authors based at the issuing institution. The core of the consists of all the papers in the journal Com- Linguistics, the books and papers in books published in the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) book series &amp;quot;Studies in Natural Language all the papers republished in in Language Processing edited by Grosz, Sparck Jones, and Webber), all the papers to be found in the conference proceedings volumes of ACL, European ACL, COLING, TINLAP (Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing) and TANLU (Theoretical Aspects of Natural Language Understanding), together with all the papers on natural-language processing to be found in the Intelligence Intelliin the conference proceedings volumes of AAAI (American Association for Artificial Intelligence), AISB (Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour), ECAI (European Conference on Artificial Intelligence), and IJCAI (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence). This core has been augmented by individual papers drawn from numerous journals, conference and workshop proceedings, ad hoc publications, the contents of most of the edited collections on NLP, and by the rather few texts and monographs that we know to have been published on the topic. In selecting non-core items for inclusion, . . .we used the question, &amp;quot;Would the editor of Computa- Linguistics this paper a relevant submission to the journal?&amp;quot; as a very rough guide for deciding whether or not to include details of a paper. The bibliography source files are now kept on-line at Stanford University and can be accessed by computer mail by people with access to the relevant academic network. Send computer mail to clbib@russell.stanford.edu with the single word &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;Subject:&amp;quot; field in order to receive instructions on searching the bibliography automatically by mail.
