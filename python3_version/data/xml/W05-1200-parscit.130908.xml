Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999614791666667">
The last few years have seen a surge in interest in modeling techniques aimed at measuring
semantic equivalence and entailment, with work on paraphrase acquisition/generation, WordNet-
based expansion, distributional similarity, supervised learning of semantic variability in information
extraction, and the identification of patterns in template-based QA. Being able to identify when two
strings ”mean the same thing” or that one entails the other are crucial abilities for a broad range of
NLP-related applications, ranging from question answering to summarization.
These proceedings contain a rich variety of papers centered on the problem of modeling semantic
overlap between linguistic strings. This is a difficult problem space, encompassing issues of lexical
choice, syntactic alternation, semantic inference, and reference/discourse structure.
We were pleased by the strong level of interest in the workshop, which resulted in a number of high-
quality submissions. Each paper was blind-reviewed by 2-3 members of the Program Committee, and
we were forced to make some difficult choices in determining the final schedule.
This workshop is intended to bring together people working on empirical, application-independent
approaches to the practical problems of semantic inference. While different applications face similar
underlying semantic problems, these problems have typically been addressed in an application-specific
manner. In the absence of a generic evaluation framework, it is difficult to compare semantic methods
that were developed for different applications. We are particularly hopeful that the workshop will help
foster discussion around common datasets and evaluation strategies that will help guide future work in
this area.
We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the hard-working members of the program committee.
We’d also like to thank Mirella Lapata, Jason Eisner, Philipp Koehn, and Dragomir Radev for their
organizational help.
We hope you enjoy this workshop!
