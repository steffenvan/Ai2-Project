Many documents are available to a computer
only as images from paper. However, most nat-
ural language processing systems expect their
input as character-coded text, which may be
difficult or expensive to extract accurately
from the page. We describe a method for con-
verting a document image into character shape
codes and word shape tokens. We believe that
this representation, which is both cheap and
robust, is sufficient for many NLP tasks. In this
paper, we show that the representation is suffi-
cient for determining which of 23 languages
the document is written in, using only a small
number of features, with greater than 90%
accuracy overall.

Computational linguists work with texts. Computational
linguistic applications range from natural language
understanding to information retrieval to machine trans-
lation. Such systems usually assume the language of the
text that is being processed. However, as corpora
become larger and more diverse this assumption
becomes less warranted. Attention is now turning to the
issue of determining the language or languages of a text
before further processing is done. Several sources of
information for language determination have been tried:
short words (Kulikowski 1991, Ingle 1976); n-grams of
words (Batchelder 1992); n-grams of characters (Cavner
&amp; Trenlde 1994); diacritics and special characters
(Beesley 1988, Newman 1987); syllable characteristics
(Mustonen 1965); morphology and syntax (Ziegler
1991). Each of these approaches is promising although
none is completely accurate. More fundamentally, many
rely on relatively large amounts of text data and all rely
on data in the form of character codes (e.g., ASCII).
In today&apos;s world of text-based information, how-
ever, not all sources of text will be character coded.
Many documents such as incoming faxes, patent appli-
cations, and office memos are only accessible on paper.
Processes such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
have been developed for mapping paper documents into
character-coded text.
However, for applications like OCR, it is desirable
to know the language a document is in before trying to
decode its characters. There appears to be a fundamental
Catch-22: natural language processing systems want to
be able to work automatically with arbitrary documents,
many of which may be available only on paper, and in
the process, they minimally need to know which lan-
guage or languages are present. The algorithms cited
above can determine a document&apos;s language, but they
require a character-coded representation of the text.
OCR can produce such a representation, but OCR does
not work well unless the language(s) of the document
are known. So how can the language of a paper docu-
ment be determined?
We have developed a method which reliably deter-
mines the language or languages of a document image.
In this paper, we discuss Roman-alphabet languages
such as English, Polish, and Swahili; see Spitz (1994)
for a discussion of the determination of Asian-script lan-
guages. Our method finesses the problems inherent in
mapping from an image to a character-coded representa-
tion: we map instead from the image to a shape-based
representation. The basal representation is the character
shape code of which there are a smell number. These
shape codes are aggregated into word shape tokens
which are delimited by white space. From examining
these word shape tokens we can determine the language
of the document. An example of the transformation from
character codes to character shape codes is shown in fig-
ure!.

cesses, we are finding that this representation may itself
be sufficient for natural language applications such as
document indexing and content characterization (see
Nakayama (this volume), Sibun &amp; Farrar 1994). We find
these indications exciting because OCR is an expensive,
slow, and often inaccurate process, especially in the pres-
ence of printing and scanning artifacts such as broken or
touching characters or skew or curvature of text lines.
Thus, if our technique allows natural language process-
ing systems to apply OCR selectively or to side-step
OCR entirely, such systems will become faster, less
expensive, and more robust.
In this paper, we first explain the background of our
system that constructs character shape codes and word
shape tokens from a document image. We next describe
our method for language determination from this shape-
based representation, and demonstrate our approach
using only the three languages English, French, and Ger-
man. We then describe an automated version of this pro-
cess that allows us to apply our techniques to an arbitrary
set of languages and show its performance on 23 Roman-
alphabet languages.
2 Character shape codes and word
shape tokens
Our determinations about document characteristics are
made neither on the raw image&apos; nor on the character
codes by which the document can be represented. The
determinations are made on a shape-based representation
built of a novel component, the character shape code
(Spitz 1993).
Four horizontal lines define the boundaries of three
significant zones on each text line (see fig= 2). The
area between the bottom and the baseline is the
descender zone; the area between the baseline and the
top of such characters as x is the x zone; and the area
between the x-height level and the top is the ascender
zone.

Characterizations of the number of connected com-
ponents in a character cell and, in some instances, their
aspect ratios, contribute to the coding. Thus most charac-
ters can be readily mapped from their positions relative
to the baseline and x-height to a small number of distinct
codes (see figure 3).2

2.1 Typesetting effects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999626">
Typesetters use different conventions. For example, in
German text ü may be set as ue and B may be set ss.
Therefore, there may be several-to-one mappings of
typeset information to character shape codes, since ii
maps to U and ue to XX.
If this shape mapping can be done from document
images, it can more trivially be accomplished from char-
acter-coded documents (e.g., ASCII, ISO-Latin-1, JIS,
Unicode), providing, of course, that the method of
encoding is known.

<bodyText confidence="0.999994625">
Our approach takes on a much less difficult problem than
does OCR. There is no need to investigate the fme struc-
ture of character images, the number of classes is small,
and measurements are largely independent of font or
typeface. As a result, the process of classifying text into
character shape codes and aggregating those codes into
word shape tokens is two to three orders of magnitude
faster than current OCR technology.

We have found that we can readily distinguish the lan-
guage of a document for 23 Roman-alphabet (mostly
European) languages from a relatively small text. This
technique exploits the high frequency of short words in
such languages and the diversity of their word shape
token representations.

mining a document&apos;s language from the shape-based

work has been reported in Nakayama &amp; Spitz 1993). Our
system learns how to discriminate a set of languages;
then, for any input document, the system determines to
which language it belongs. Our method uses the statisti-
cal technique of Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA).
First, we demonstrate the method using a hand-selected
set of distinguishing features for a small set of languages.
In section 4, we describe our process for automating the
selection of distinguishing features across an arbitrary
number of languages, and show the results on a corpus
that includes documents from 23 languages.
Our initial set of discriminable languages comprised
English, French, and German. To ascertain the set of dis-
criminating features, we built a training corpus of
approximately 15 scanned images of one-page docu-
ments for each language. We tokenized these images fol-
lowing the procedure described in section 2. This
resulted in 7621 tokens from English, 6826 tokens from
French, and 5472 tokens from German. We then ranked
the frequency of word shape tokens across each corpus
and noted the ten most frequent tokens. By comparing
these top ten word shape tokens for each of the lan-
guages, we were able to select one per language that was
both frequent in that language and less frequent in the
other languages. Intuitively, each of these tokens is char-
acteristic of its language; therefore, we call these charac-
teristic tokens (see figure 4). The characteristic token for
English is AAx; AAx constitutes 7% of the tokens in the

man corpus, Aix is not the most frequent token: XX, XX A ,
Aix, and 30LX each make up about 3% of the corpus while
AXX constitutes 6%. However, of the five, only Aix is
rare in the other languages. While Ax is frequent in all
three corpora, it is overwhelmingly frequent in French,
where it makes up 11% of the tokens (vs. 4% for English
and 2% for German). These differences in the distribu-
tion of the characteristic tokens in the three corpora are
sufficient for LDA to correctly identify each language
almost every time (see figure 5).3 The documents are
from the training corpus: by a process called cross-vali-
dation, each was removed from the training corpus one
at a time and classified based on the discriminating
results from training on the rest of the corpus.

It may be noted that each of the top five word shape
tokens in each of the English, French, and German cor-
pora is a mapping of closed class words such as deter-
miners, conjunctions, and pronouns. This is not
surprising, since closed class words are frequent in Euro-
pean languages. Of course, other words map to these
word shape tokens too. For example, in English, the
word flu maps to AAx. However the overwhelming
proportion of AAx tokens in the English corpus are map-
pings of the. Since the is such a common word in
English, we can expect AAx to be characteristic of any
shape-level representation of an English document. Sim-
ilar situations obtain in the other languages.
While it may seem fortuitous that in English AAx is
virtually always a mapping of the, unique word shape
tokens are more common in Roman-alphabet languages
than one might suppose. We mapped an English lexicon
of surface forms into word shape tokens and discovered
that 20% of the resulting word shape tokens were unique;
examples include the =face forms apple and
apples.

In the previous section, we discussed the selection of dis-
criminating word shape tokens by hand. We now
describe our method for automating this process. We
have been able to use this technique to discover a dis-
criminating set of tokens for a large fraction of the
languages written in the Roman alphabet. We initially
tested this automated technique by recapitulating our

printing and scanning artifacts, many characters are artifac-

4.1 The automated method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830642857143">
While it is easy to hand-select a single discriminating
token for each of a few languages, the task becomes
more complex as the number of languages grows. Fur-
ther, a single feature per language may no longer be
sufficient; a profile, or vector of features, for each lan-
guage would be more robust.
For the automated method, a corpus for each of the
languages is scanned and tokenized, and the tokens are
sorted by frequency. Then most frequent tokens for each
corpus are selected. We apply stepwise discriminant
analysis, a variant of LDA, to this token set: variables are
selected one by one according to their ability to discrim-
inate between languages. The optimal value of n has not
yet been determined. We need to gather enough discrim-
inating tokens to characterize the languages as com-
pletely as possible. However, if we use too many, the
accuracy of the classification may actually be degraded;
further, relatively uncommon tokens may improve per-
formance on test data but may not work well in general.
As we discuss below, n =5 suffices for three languages,
but may not be optimal for 23.
There are several considerations for ensuring that
this process is robust. The size of the corpus for each lan-
guage must be sufficiently large in terms of both the
number of documents and the total number of word
shape tokens. The number of documents must be large
enough to enable the LDA testing procedure to system-
atically eliminate some of them for cross validation with-
out skewing the overall characteristics of the corpus. The
number of word shape tokens must be large enough to be
reflective of the language in which the documents are
written to allow for accurate comparison between lan-
guages. A further consideration is that the number of dis-
criminating tokens used by the LDA system should be
considerably smaller than the number of documents.
For our initial test we selected the five most frequent
word shape tokens from each of English, French, and
German; this formed a set of ten tokens (because of over-
lap between corpora). Using stepwise discriminant anal-
ysis, the system found the best way to use the tokens by
selecting the single token that was most discriminating
and then for each of the remaining tokens adding the next
most discriminating tokens given the ones that had
already been selected. This resulted in a ranking of nine
discriminating tokens (Ax, xA, ix, Aix, AXX, XX, AAx,
xxA, voL). The tenth was not found to improve the reli-
ability of the discrimination; in fact accuracy peaked at
four tokens.
We compared the performance of the automated
system with that using the hand-selected tokens. When
the top three automatically-selected tokens were used,
performance was comparable to that of the three hand-
selected tokens. Interestingly, there is no overlap in the
misclassification of documents. Using four automati-
cally-selected tokens, the system classified all but one
document correctly (see figure 6).

<bodyText confidence="0.965690609756097">
We have constructed a database of 755 one-page docu-
ments in 23 languages including virtually every
European language written in the Roman alphabet. There
are 18 Indo-European languages: Afrikaans, Croatian,
Czech/Slovak&apos;&apos;, Danish, Dutch, English, French, Gaelic,
German, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portu-
guese, Rumanian, Spanish, Swedish, and Welsh. There
are two Uralic languages: Finnish and Hungarian.
Finally, we include three languages from disparate fam-
ilies: Turkish, Swahili, and Vietnamese.
To construct a set of discriminating features, we
selected the five most frequent word shape tokens from
each language. Because of overlap, this resulted in 23
tokens. Some of these discriminating tokens have a high
frequency across languages; in fact, XX appears in the top
five of 22 of the languages we examined. However, even
when we consider 23 languages, there are eight tokens
appearing in the top five of one language which do not
appear in the top five of any others. (This does not mean
of course, that these tokens do not appear in other lan-
guages at all, but simply that they are relatively much
less frequent.) The 23 tokens comprise the set (x,
XXX, XXXX, i, ix, xi, xix, A, AAx, Ax, AxA, AxAx, AXX,
Axxx, xA, xxA, Ai, Aix, g, gx, xg, xxg, jx).
As before, we used LDA to build a statistical model
of the language categorizations, and by cross validation
tested the accuracy of the model (see figure 7). Our over-
all accuracy is better than 90%, while the accuracy for
individual languages varies between 100% and 75%,
with an outlier of 44% for Czech/Slovak. Examination of
misclassifications proves somewhat instructive, as can
be seen in the confusion matrix in figure 8. For example,
Dutch and Afrikaans are closely related languages, and
the only error in either language is the categorization of
one Afrikaans document as Dutch. Among the five

languages, but this yielded worse results than combining
them. We feel our decision was legitimate because &amp;quot;Slovak is
similar enough to Czech to be considered by some as merely
a dialect&amp;quot; despite &amp;quot;the existence of slightly different alpha-
bets, as well as distinct literatures&amp;quot; (Katzner 1986, p 91).

Croatian, Czech/Slovak, and Polish are all Slavic
languages; Hungarian and Finnish are related to each
other but not to any other European languages. However,
there is a large cluster of errors within the set of these
five languages. Most of these errors are for Czech/Slo-
vak documents; in fact, Czech/Slovak was recognized
far less accurately than any other language and it is
unclear why. It may be the case that many of these doc-
uments are of poor quality. Seventeen of the 69 errors
seem to be random; while we are working to reduce such
errors, it is unlikely that we can eliminate them entirely.
It is possible that 23 discriminating tokens is not suffi-
cient; since the accuracy has been improved by the addi-
tion of each new token, adding several more may
continue the improvement.

4.3 Discussion of methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958157894737">
While LDA has proved adequate, there are some draw-
backs to this technique. We are somewhat disappointed
by the system&apos;s accuracy. Examination of token frequen-
cies suggests that the profiles for each language are
distinct enough that 90% should be a lower bound on
classification accuracy. However, for several languages
the accuracy was much lower, and for many more it was
not much better than 90%. A more troubling problem is
the instability of the model. When we add or delete lan-
guages, overall accuracy fluctuates between 80% and
93%. This suggests that removing a language affects the
typical distribution across all languages, which should
not be the case. It is difficult to identify the underlying
causes of both of these observations. Finally, the results
of LDA are difficult to interpret. All these considerations
suggest that LDA may not be the best technique to use.
Therefore, we are exploring alternative statistical mod-
els, such as classification trees, to fmd an approach that
is more robust for our task.

5 Comparison with other methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999491416666667">
It is difficult for us to compare our approach to other
methods of language determination. Most sources we
have found are simply guides for librarians or translators.
For example, Ingle (1976) found that the presence or
absence of specific one- or two-character words suffices
to distinguish among 17 Roman-alphabet languages.
There are several implemented systems, some of which
report on their accuracy, but none is addressing exactly
the same problem as ours: all work from character-coded
text. However, it is useful to get a ballpark estimate of
the accuracy to be expected of character-based systems.
Batchelder (1992) trained neural networks to recog-
nize 3-6 character words from 10 languages. While her
networks had high accuracy in recognizing words from
the training set, their best-case performance on untrained
words was 53%, thus making accurate determination of
a document&apos;s language highly unlikely.
Cavner and Trenkle (1994) used n-grams of charac-
ters for n = 1 to 5. Their task was not language determi-
nation per se, but determining to which country&apos;s
newsgroup (in the netnews soc.culture hierarchy) a doc-
ument belonged. In each newsgroup, the documents
were written in either English or other language(s). For
documents longer than 300 characters, the system deter-
mined the correct newsgroup with 97% accuracy when
using the 100 most frequent n-grams. These results are
good, but the technique should be tested on a set of doc-
uments for which the languages are known and the topics
are varied.
Kulikowski (1991) used a semi-automatic method to
determine a profile of frequent 2-3 character words for
nine languages. He claims at least 95% accuracy for
determining that a single-language document is in one of
the nine languages or in none of them. Unfortunately he
does not expand on this claim. Henrich (1989) used cri-
teria such as language-specific word-boundary character
sequences and common short words to determine the lan-
guage of sentences in English, French, or German.
Mustonen (1965) used discriminant analysis to dis-
tinguish English, Swedish, and Finnish words. His sys-
tem, which used 43 discriminating features, such as
particular letters and syllable types, performed with 76%
accuracy. This relatively poor performance is probably
due to the data being isolated words rather than docu-
ments, though it may also be due to overfitting of the test
data by too many features (see section 4.1).
We would like to emphasize that our statistics on
word shape token distribution across the various Ian-

guages are generated entirely from scanned images of
text. We feel this is important because the text whose
language we are trying to identify should not be system-
atically different in any way from the texts from which
the discriminate analysis was generated. For example,
typographic conventions such as a ligature between a
vowel and an acute accent (as in characters like a) cause
the character shape code recognizer to classify these
characters as A. However, if we were working from
encoded on-line corpora we would &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; that such a
character should be classified as i.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973739130435">
We have described our method for generating word
shape tokens from images and have shown how this
shape-level representation of the text can be used for
important tasks such as determining the language or lan-
guages of a document. We have shown that the method
can discriminate among 23 languages with high
accuracy.
Since our approach is statistical, the more text our
system sees in a document image, the more reliably it can
determine the document&apos;s language. So far, we have not
tried to determine the language of a document shorter
than 27 words, and most of the documents we work with
are a few hundred words long (2000-3000 characters).
We are investigating the lower bound on the length of
texts whose language we can reliably determine. In the
ideal case we would be able to detect the presence of a
very few words of a secondary language interpolated into
a document predominated by another language.
In other work, we are using the shape-level repre-
sentation as input to higher-level natural language pro-
cessing systems for rudimentary content analysis.
However, many sorts of information, particularly style
characteristics, can be derived from the shape-level rep-

resentation directly. For instance, since the number of
character shape codes extracted form a document is com-
parable to the number of characters, characterizations
about word length in a shape-level representation apply
as well to the character-coded version of the document.
This word length characterization is not perfect: ligatures
introduce some uncertainty. Additionally, braces, brack-
ets, and parentheses which are typically set contiguous
with words, are currently mapped to A, this will affect
word length counts. We are refining the mapping to
account for these delimiting characters.

However, most natural language processing systems expect their input as character-coded text, which may be difficult or expensive to extract accurately from the page. We describe a method for cona document image into shape shape tokens. believe that this representation, which is both cheap and robust, is sufficient for many NLP tasks.

Our system learns how to discriminate a set of languages; then, for any input document, the system determines to which language it belongs. Our method uses the statistical technique of Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA). First, we demonstrate the method using a hand-selected set of distinguishing features for a small set of languages.

Several sources of information for language determination have been tried: short words (Kulikowski 1991, Ingle 1976); n-grams of words (Batchelder 1992); n-grams of characters (Cavner &amp; Trenlde 1994); diacritics and special characters (Beesley 1988, Newman 1987); syllable characteristics (Mustonen 1965); morphology and syntax (Ziegler 1991). Each of these approaches is promising although none is completely accurate. More fundamentally, many rely on relatively large amounts of text data and all rely on data in the form of character codes (e.g., ASCII). In today&apos;s world of text-based information, however, not all sources of text will be character coded. Many documents such as incoming faxes, patent applications, and office memos are only accessible on paper.

The shape-based representation of a document is proving to be a remarkably rich source of information. While our initial goal has been to use it for language identification, in support of downstream OCR pro15 cesses, we are finding that this representation may itself be sufficient for natural language applications such as document indexing and content characterization (see Nakayama (this volume), Sibun &amp; Farrar 1994). We find these indications exciting because OCR is an expensive, slow, and often inaccurate process, especially in the presence of printing and scanning artifacts such as broken or touching characters or skew or curvature of text lines. Thus, if our technique allows natural language processing systems to apply OCR selectively or to side-step OCR entirely, such systems will become faster, less expensive, and more robust. In this paper, we first explain the background of our system that constructs character shape codes and word shape tokens from a document image. We next describe our method for</context>

We then describe an automated version of this process that allows us to apply our techniques to an arbitrary set of languages and show its performance on 23 Romanalphabet languages. 2 Character shape codes and word shape tokens Our determinations about document characteristics are made neither on the raw image&apos; nor on the character codes by which the document can be represented. The determinations are made on a shape-based representation built of a novel component, the character shape code (Spitz 1993). Four horizontal lines define the boundaries of three significant zones on each text line (see fig= 2). The area between the bottom and the baseline is the descender zone; the area between the baseline and the top of such characters as x is the x zone; and the area between the x-height level and the top is the ascender zone.

This technique exploits the high frequency of short words in such languages and the diversity of their word shape token representations. In this section, we describe our method for determining a document&apos;s language from the shape-based representation derived from the image (some of this 2. This paper adopts the following conventions: monospaced to represent input characters, boldface to represent the character shape codes (A, x, i, g, j, U), and sans-serif to represent typographic conventions. 16 work has been reported in Nakayama &amp; Spitz 1993). Our system learns how to discriminate a set of languages; then, for any input document, the system determines to which language it belongs. Our method uses the statistical technique of Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA). First, we demonstrate the method using a hand-selected set of distinguishing features for a small set of languages. In section 4, we describe our process for automating the selection of distinguishing features across an arbitrary number of languages, and show the results on a corpus that includes documents from 23 languages.

The algorithms cited above can determine a document&apos;s language, but they require a character-coded representation of the text. OCR can produce such a representation, but OCR does not work well unless the language(s) of the document are known. So how can the language of a paper document be determined? We have developed a method which reliably determines the language or languages of a document image. In this paper, we discuss Roman-alphabet languages such as English, Polish, and Swahili; see Spitz (1994) for a discussion of the determination of Asian-script languages. Our method finesses the problems inherent in mapping from an image to a character-coded representation: we map instead from the image to a shape-based representation. The basal representation is the character shape code of which there are a smell number. These shape codes are aggregated into word shape tokens which are delimited by white space. From examining these word shape tokens we can determine the language of the document. An example of the transformation from character codes to character shape codes is shown in figure!. C</context>
