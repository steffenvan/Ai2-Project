Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999148">
The definitions of the basic concepts,
rules, and constraints of centering the-
ory involve underspecified notions such
as ‘previous utterance’, ‘realization’,
and ‘ranking’. We attempted to find the
best way of defining each such notion
among those that can be annotated reli-
ably, and using a corpus of texts in two
domains of practical interest. Our main
result is that trying to reduce the num-
ber of utterances without a backward-
looking center (CB) results in an in-
creased number of cases in which some
discourse entity, but not the CB, gets
pronominalized, and viceversa.

1 MOTIVATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907083333333">
Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et
al., 1998b) is best characterized as a ‘parametric’
theory: its key definitions and claims involve no-
tions such as ‘utterance’, ‘realization’, and ‘rank-
ing’ which are not completely specified; their pre-
cise definition is left as a matter for empirical re-
search, and may vary from language to language.
A first goal of the work presented in this paper
was to find which way of specifying these param-
eters, among the many proposed in the literature,
would make the claims of centering theory most
accurate as predictors of coherence and pronomi-
nalization for English. We did this by annotating
a corpus of English texts with the sort of informa-
tion required to implement some of the most pop-
ular variants of centering theory, and using this
corpus to automatically check two central claims
of the theory, the claim that all utterances have a
backward looking center (CB) (Constraint 1), and
the claim that if any discourse entity is pronomi-
nalized, the CB is (Rule 1). In doing this, we tried
to make sure we would only use information that
could be annotated reliably.
Our second goal was to evaluate the predic-
tions of the theory in domains of interest for real
applications–natural language generation, in our
case. For this reason, we used texts in two gen-
res not yet studied, but of interest to developers of
NLG systems: instructional texts and descriptions
of museum objects to be displayed on Web pages.
The paper is organized as follows. We first re-
view the basic notions of the theory. We then dis-
cuss the methods we used: our annotation method
and how the annotation was used. In Section 4 we
present the results of the study. A discussion of
these results follows.

2 FUNDAMENTALS OF CENTERING
THEORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996820625">
Centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et
al., 1998b) is an ‘object-centered’ theory of text
coherence: it attempts to characterize the texts
that can be considered coherent on the basis of
the way discourse entities are introduced and dis-
cussed.1 At the same time, it is also meant to
be a theory of salience: i.e., it attempts to pre-
dict which entities will be most salient at any
given time (which should be useful for a natural
language generator, since it is these entities that
are most typically pronominalized (Gundel et al.,
1993)).
According to the theory, every UTTERANCE in
a spoken dialogue or written text introduces into
the discourse a number of FORWARD-LOOKING
CENTERS (CFs). CFs correspond more or less

centered’ notions of coherence, see (Stevenson et al., 2000).

to discourse entities in the sense of (Karttunen,
1976; Webber, 1978; Heim, 1982), and can be
linked to CFs introduced by previous or suc-
cessive utterances. Forward-looking centers are
RANKED, and because of this ranking, some CFs
acquire particular prominence. Among them, the
so-called BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER (CB),
defined as follows:
Backward Looking Center (CB) CB(UZ+1), the
BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER of utter-
ance UZ+1, is the highest ranked element of
CF(UZ) that is realized in UZ+1.
Utterance UZ+1 is classified as a CONTINUE if
CB(UZ+1) = CB(UZ) and CB(UZ+1) is the most
highly ranked CF of UZ+1; as a RETAIN if the CB
remains the same, but it’s not any longer the most
highly-ranked CF; and as a SHIFT if CB(UZ+1) zA
CB(UZ).
The main claims of the theory are articulated in
terms of constraints and rules on CFs and CB.
Constraint 1: All utterances of a segment except
for the 1st have exactly one CB.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.8999105">
Rule 1: if any CF is pronominalized, the CB is.
Rule 2: (sequences of) continuations are pre-
ferred over (sequences of) retains, which are
preferred over (sequences of) shifts
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998749645161291">
Constraint 1 and Rule 2 express a preference for
utterances in a text to talk about the same ob-
jects; Rule 1 is the main claim of the theory about
pronominalization. In this paper we concentrate
on Constraint 1 and Rule 1.
One of the most unusual features of centering
theory is that the notions of utterance, previous
utterance, ranking, and realization used in the def-
initions above are left unspecified, to be appropri-
ately defined on the basis of empirical evidence,
and possibly in a different way for each language.
As a result, centering theory is best viewed as a
cluster of theories, each of which specifies the
parameters in a different ways: e.g., ranking has
been claimed to depend on grammatical function
(Kameyama, 1985; Brennan et al., 1987), on the-
matic roles (Cote, 1998), and on the discourse sta-
tus of the CFs (Strube and Hahn, 1999); there are
at least two definitions of what counts as ‘previ-
ous utterance’ (Kameyama, 1998; Suri and Mc-
Coy, 1994); and ‘realization’ can be interpreted
either in a strict sense, i.e., by taking a CF to be
realized in an utterance only if an NP in that utter-
ance denotes that CF, or in a looser sense, by also
counting a CF as ‘realized’ if it is referred to in-
directly by means of a bridging reference (Clark,
1977), i.e., an anaphoric expression that refers to
an object which wasn’t mentioned before but is
somehow related to an object that already has, as
in the vase ... the handle (see, e.g., the discussion
in (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b)).

3 METHODS

<bodyText confidence="0.999689972222222">
The fact that so many basic notions of centering
theory do not have a completely specified def-
inition makes empirical verification of the the-
ory rather difficult. Because any attempt at di-
rectly annotating a corpus for ‘utterances’ and
their CBs is bound to force the annotators to adopt
some specification of the basic notions of the the-
ory, previous studies have tended to study a par-
ticular variant of the theory (Di Eugenio, 1998;
Kameyama, 1998; Passonneau, 1993; Strube and
Hahn, 1999; Walker, 1989). A notable exception
is (Tetreault, 1999), which used an annotated cor-
pus to compare the performance of two variants
of centering theory.
The work discussed here, like Tetreault’s, is an
attempt at using corpora to compare different ver-
sions of centering theory, but considering also pa-
rameters of centering theory not studied in this
earlier work. In particular, we looked at different
ways of defining the notion of utterance, we stud-
ied the definition of realization, and more gener-
ally the role of semantic information. We did this
by annotating a corpus with information that has
been claimed by one or the other version of cen-
tering theory to play a role in the definitions of
its basic notions - e.g., the grammatical function
of an NP, anaphoric relations (including infor-
mation about bridging references) and how sen-
tences break up into clauses and subclausal units–
and then tried to find out the best way of specify-
ing these notions automatically, by trying out dif-
ferent configurations of parameters, and counting
the number of violations of the constraints and
rules that would result by adopting a particular
parameter configuration. We used eight annotators for the reliability study
and the annotation.

The Data

The aim of our project, which is called
GNOME and whose home page is at
http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/ - gnome,
is to develop NP generation algorithms whose
generality is to be verified by incorporating
them in two distinct systems: the ILEX system
developed at the University of Edinburgh, that
generates Web pages describing museum objects
on the basis of the perceived status of its user’s
knowledge and of the objects she previously
looked at (Oberlander et al., 1998); and the
ICONOCLAST system, developed at the Univer-
sity of Brighton, that supports the creation of
patient information leaflets (Scott et al., 1998).
The corpus we collected includes texts from
both the domains we are studying. The texts
in the museum domain consist of descriptions
of museum objects and brief texts about the
artists that produced them; the texts in the
pharmaceutical domain are leaflets providing the
patients with the legally mandatory information
about their medicine. The total size of the corpus
is of about 6,000 NPs. For this study we used
about half of each subset, for a total number of
about 3,000 NPs, of which 103 are third person
pronouns (72 in the museum domain, 31 in the
pharmaceutical domain) and 61 are third-person
possessive pronouns (58 in the museum domain,
3 in the pharmaceutical domain).

Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999643314814815">
Previous empirical studies of centering theory
typically involved a single annotator annotat-
ing her corpus according to her own subjective
judgment (Passonneau, 1993; Kameyama, 1998;
Strube and Hahn, 1999). One of our goals was
to use for our study only information that could
be annotated reliably (Passonneau and Litman,
1993; Carletta, 1996), as we believe this will
make our results easier to replicate. The price
we paid to achieve replicability is that we could-
n’t test all hypotheses proposed in the literature,
especially about segmentation and about ranking.
We discuss some of the problems in what follows.
(The latest version of the annotation manual is
available from the GNOME project’s home page.)
Utterances Kameyama (1998) noted that iden-
tifying utterances with sentences is problematic
in the case of multiclausal sentences: e.g., gram-
matical function ranking becomes difficult to
measure, as there may be more than one sub-
ject. She proposed to use all and only tensed
clauses instead of sentences as utterance units,
and then classified finite clauses into (i) utter-
ance units that constitute a ’permanent’ update
of the local focus: these include coordinated
clauses and adjuncts) and (ii) utterance units that
result in updates that are then erased, much as
in the way the information provided by subor-
dinated discourse segments is erased when they
are popped. Kameyama called these EMBED-
DED utterance units, and proposed that clauses
that serve as verbal complements behave this way.
Suri and McCoy (1994) did a study that led them
to propose that some types of adjuncts–in particu-
lar, clauses headed by after and before–should be
treated as ‘embedded’ rather than as ‘permanent
updates’ as suggested by Kameyama; these re-
sults were subsequently confirmed by more con-
trolled experiments Pearson et al. (2000). Nei-
ther Kameyama nor Suri and McCoy discuss par-
entheticals; Kameyama only briefly mentions rel-
ative clauses, but doesn’t analyze them in detail.
In order to evaluate these definitions of ut-
terance (sentences versus finite clauses), as well
as the different ways of defining ‘previous utter-
ance’, we marked up in our corpus what we called
(DISCOURSE) UNITS. These include clauses, as
well as other sentence subconstituents which may
be treated as separate utterances, including paren-
theticals, preposed PPs, and (the second element
of) coordinated VPs. The instructions for mark-
ing up units were in part derived from (Marcu,
1999); for each unit, the following attributes were
marked:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.948628909090909">
• utype: whether the unit is a main clause,
a relative clause, appositive, a parenthetical,
etc.
• verbed: whether the unit contains a verb or
not.
• finite: for verbed units, whether the verb is
finite or not.
• subject: for verbed units, whether they have
a full subject, an empty subject (expletive,
as in there sentences), or no subject (e.g., for
infinitival clauses).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995492">
The agreement on identifying the boundaries of
units, using the K statistic discussed in (Carletta,
1996), was K _ .9 (for two annotators and 500
units); the agreement on features(2 annotators
and at least 200 units) was follows:

utype .76
verbed .9
finite .81
subject .86

<bodyText confidence="0.998707666666667">
NPs Our instructions for identifying NP mark-
ables derive from those proposed in the MATE
project scheme for annotating anaphoric relations
(Poesio et al., 1999). We annotated attributes of
NPs which could be used to define their ranking,
including:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990363454545455">
• The NP type, cat (pronoun, proper name,
etc.)
• A few other ‘basic’ syntactic features, num,
per, and gen, that could be used to identify
contexts in which the antecedent of a pro-
noun could be identified unambiguously;
• The grammatical function, gf;
• ani: whether the object denoted is animate
or inanimate
• deix: whether the object is a deictic refer-
ence or not

<bodyText confidence="0.9242255">
The agreement values for these attributes are as

<bodyText confidence="0.969823223300971">
one of the features of NPs claimed to affect rank-
ing (Sidner, 1979; Cote, 1998) that we haven’t
so far been able to annotate because of failure
to reach acceptable agreement is thematic roles
(K _ .35).
Anaphoric information Finally, in order to
compute whether a CF from an utterance was re-
alized directly or indirectly in the following ut-
terance, we marked up anaphoric relations be-
tween NPs, again using a variant of the MATE
scheme. Theories of focusing such as (Sidner,
1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999), as well as our own
early experiments with centering, suggested that
indirect realization can play quite a crucial role in
maintaining the CB; however, previous work, par-
ticularly in the context of the MUC initiative, sug-
gested that while it’s fairly easy to achieve agree-
ment on identity relations, marking up bridging
references is quite hard; this was confirmed by,
e.g., Poesio and Vieira (1998). As a result we did
annotate this type of relations, but to achieve a
reasonable agreement, and to contain somehow
the annotators’ work, we limited the types of re-
lations annotators were supposed to mark up, and
we specified priorities. Thus, besides identity
(IDENT) we only marked up three non-identity
(‘bridging’ (Clark, 1977)) relations, and only re-
lations between objects. The relations we mark
up are a subset of those proposed in the ‘extended
relations’ version of the MATE scheme (Poesio et
al., 1999) and include set membership (ELE-
MENT),
ELE-
MENT), subset (SUBSET), and ‘generalized pos-
session’ (POSS), which includes part-of relations
as well as more traditional ownership relations.
As expected, we achieved a rather good agree-
ment on identity relations. In our most recent
analysis (two annotators looking at the anaphoric
relations between 200 NPs) we observed no real
disagreements; 79.4% of these relations were
marked up by both annotators; 12.8% by only
one of them; and in 7.7% of the cases, one of
the annotators marked up a closer antecedent than
the other. Concerning bridges, limiting the re-
lations did limit the disagreements among an-
notators (only 4.8% of the relations are actually
marked differently) but only 22% of bridging ref-
erences were marked in the same way by both an-
notators; 73.17% of relations are marked by only
one or the other annotator. So reaching agreement
on this information involved several discussions
between annotators and more than one pass over
the corpus.
Segmentation Segmenting text in a reliable
fashion is still an open problem, and in addition
the relation between centering (i.e., local focus
shifts) and segmentation (i.e., global focus shifts)
is still not clear: some see them as independent
aspects of attentional structure, whereas other re-
searchers define centering transitions with respect
to segments (see, e.g., the discussion in the intro-
duction to (Walker et al., 1998b)). Our prelim-
inary experiments at annotating discourse struc-
ture didn’t give good results, either. Therefore,
we only used the layout structure of the texts
as a rough indication of discourse structure. In
the museum domain, each object description was
treated as a separate segment; in the pharmaceu-
tical domain, each subsection of a leaflet was
treated as a separate segment. We then identified
by hand those violations of Constraint 1 that ap-
peared to be motivated by too broad a segmenta-
tion of the text.2
Automatic computation of centering
information
The annotation thus produced was used to au-
tomatically compute utterances according to the
particular configuration of parameters chosen,
and then to compute the CFs and the CB (if any)
of each utterance on the basis of the anaphoric
information and according to the notion of rank-
ing specified. This information was the used to
find violations of Constraint 1 and Rule 1. The
behavior of the script that computes this informa-
tion depends on the following parameters:
utterance: whether sentences, finite clauses, or
verbed clauses should be treated as utter-
ances.
previous utterance: whether adjunct clauses
should be treated Kameyama-style or
Suri-style.
rank: whether CFs should be ranked according
to grammatical function or discourse status
in Strube and Hahn’s sense
2(Cristea et al., 2000) showed that it is indeed possible
to achieve good agreement on discourse segmentation, but
that it requires intensive training and repeated iterations; we
intend to take advantage of a corpus already annotated in this
way in future work.
realization: whether only direct realization
should be counted, or also indirect realiza-
tion via bridging references.

4 MAIN RESULTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99488952173913">
The principle we used to evaluate the different
configurations of the theory was that the best def-
inition of the parameters was the one that would
lead to the fewest violations of Constraint 1 and
Rule 1. We discuss the results for each principle.
Constraint 1: All utterances of a segment
except for the 1st have precisely one CB
Our first set of figures concerns Constraint 1:
how many utterances have a CB. This con-
straint can be used to evaluate how well cen-
tering theory predicts coherence, in the follow-
ing sense: assuming that all our texts are co-
herent, if centering were the only factor behind
coherence, all utterances should verify this con-
straint. The first table shows the results obtained
by choosing the configuration that comes clos-
est to the one suggested by Kameyama (1998):
utterance=finite, prev=kameyama, rank=gf, real-
ization=direct. The first column lists the number
of utterances that satisfy Constraint 1; the second
those that do not satisfy it, but are segment-initial;
the third those that do not satisfy it and are not
segment-initial.

<bodyText confidence="0.998030875">
The previous table shows that with this config-
uration of parameters, most utterances do not sat-
isfy Constraint 1 in the strict sense even if we take
into account text segmentation (admittedly, a very
rough one). If we take sentences as utterances,
instead of finite clauses, we get fewer violations,
although about 25% of the total number of utter-
ances are violations:

<bodyText confidence="0.9815498">
Using Suri and McCoy’s definition of previous
utterance, instead of Kameyama’s (i.e., treating
adjuncts as embedded utterances) leads to a slight
improvement over Kameyama’s proposal but still
not as good as using sentences:

What about the finite clause types not consid-
ered by Kameyama or Suri and McCoy? It turns
out that we get better results if we do not treat as
utterances relative clauses (which anyway always
have a CB, under standard syntactic assumptions
about the presence of traces referring to the modi-
fied noun phrase), parentheticals, clauses that oc-
cur in subject position; and if we treat as a single
utterance matrix clauses with empty subjects and
their complements (as in it is possible that John
will arrive tomorrow).

<bodyText confidence="0.96230728">
But by far the most significant improvement to the
percentage of utterances that satisfy Constraint 1
comes by adopting a looser definition of ’real-
izes’, i.e., by allowing a discourse entity to serve
as CB of an utterance even if it’s only referred to
indirectly in that utterance by means of a bridg-
ing reference, as originally proposed by Sidner
(1979) for her discourse focus. The following se-
quence of utterances explains why this could lead
to fewer violations of Constraint 1:
(1) (u1) These “egg vases” are of exceptional
quality: (u2) basketwork bases support
egg-shaped bodies (u3) and bundles of straw
form the handles, (u4) while small eggs resting
in straw nests serve as the finial for each lid. (u5)
Each vase is decorated with inlaid decoration:
. . .
In (1), u1 is followed by four utterances. Only
the last of these directly refers to the set of egg
vases introduced in u1, while they all contain im-
plicit references to these objects. If we adopt this
looser notion of realization, the figures improve
dramatically, even with the rather restricted set of
relations on which our annotators agree. Now the
majority of utterances satisfy Constraint 1:

ing sentences as utterances:

It is important, however, to notice that even un-
der the best configuration, at least 17% of utter-
ances violate the constraint. The (possibly, obvi-
ous) explanation is that although coherence is of-
ten achieved by means of links between objects,
this is not the only way to make texts coherent.
So, in the museum domain, we find utterances
that do not refer to any of the previous CFs be-
cause they express generic statements about the
class of objects of which the object under discus-
sion is an instance, or viceversa utterances that
make a generic point that will then be illustrated
by a specific object. In the following example,
the second utterance gives some background con-
cerning the decoration of a particular object.

<bodyText confidence="0.999834857142857">
In the previous section we saw that allowing
bridging references to maintain the CB leads to
fewer violations of Constraint 1. One should
not, however, immediately conclude that it would
be a good idea to replace the strict definition
of ’realizes’ with a looser one, because there
is, unfortunately, a side effect: adopting an in-
direct notion of realizes leads to more viola-
tions of Rule 1. Figures are as follows. Us-
ing utterance=s, rank=gf, realizes=direct 22 pro-
nouns violating Rule 1 (9 museum, 13 pharmacy)
(13.4%), whereas with realizes=indirect we have
38 violations (25, 13) (23%); if we choose utter-
ance=finite, prev=suri, we have 23 violations of
rule 1 with realizes=direct (13 + 10) (14%), 32
with realizes=indirect (21 + 11) (19.5%). Using
functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to
rank the CFs led to no improvements, because of
the almost perfect correlation in our domain be-
tween subjecthood and being discourse-old. One

In the pharmaceutical leaflets we found a num-
ber of violations of Rule 1 towards the end of
texts, when the product is referred to. A possi-
ble explanation is that after the product has been
mentioned sentence after sentence in the text, by
the end of the text it is salient enough that there
is no need to put it again in the local focus by
mentioning it explicitly. E.g., it in the following
example refers to the cream, not mentioned in any
of the previous two utterances.

Our main result is that there seems to be a trade-
off between Constraint 1 and Rule 1. Allowing
for a definition of ’realizes’ that makes the CB be-
have more like Sidner’s Discourse Focus (Sidner,
1979) leads to a very significant reduction in the
number of violations of Constraint 1.3 We also
noted, however, that interpreting ‘realizes’ in this
way results in more violations of Rule 1. (No

3Footnote 2, page 3 of the intro to (Walker et al., 1998b)
suggests a weaker interpretation for the Constraint: ‘there is
no more than one CB for utterance’. This weaker form of
the Constraint does hold for most utterances, but it’s almost
vacuous, especially for grammatical function ranking, given
that utterances have at most one subject.

cal function.) The problem raised by these re-
sults is that whereas centering is intended as an
account of both coherence and local salience, dif-
ferent concepts may have to be used in Constraint
1 and Rule 1, as in Sidner’s theory. E.g., we might
have a ‘Center of Coherence’, analogous to Sid-
ner’s discourse focus, and that can be realized in-
directly; and a ‘Center of Salience’, similar to her
actor focus, and that can only be realized directly.
Constraint 1 would be about the Center of Coher-
ence, whereas Rule 1 would be about the Center
of Salience. Indeed, many versions of centering
theory have elevated the CP to the rank of a sec-
ond center.4
We also saw that texts can be coherent even
when Constraint 1 is violated, as coherence can
be ensured by other means (e.g., by rhetorical re-
lations). This, again, suggests possible revisions
to Constraint 1, requiring every utterance either
to have a center of coherence, or to be linked by a
rhetorical relation to the previous utterance.
Finally, we saw that we get fewer violations of
Constraint 1 by adopting sentences as our notion
of utterance; however, again, this results in more
violations of Rule 1. If finite clauses are used as
utterances, we found that certain types of finite
clauses not previously discussed, including rela-
tive clauses and matrix clauses with empty sub-
jects, are best not treated as utterances. We didn’t
find significant differences between Kameyama
and Suri and McCoy’s definition of ‘previous ut-
terance’. We believe however more work is still
needed to identify a completely satisfactory way
of breaking up sentences in utterance units.

<abstract confidence="0.984395499202552">The definitions of the basic concepts, rules, and constraints of centering theory involve underspecified notions such as ‘previous utterance’, ‘realization’, and ‘ranking’. We attempted to find the best way of defining each such notion among those that can be annotated reliably, and using a corpus of texts in two domains of practical interest. Our main result is that trying to reduce the number of utterances without a backwardcenter results in an increased number of cases in which some entity, but not the gets pronominalized, and viceversa. 1 MOTIVATION Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b) is best characterized as a ‘parametric’ theory: its key definitions and claims involve notions such as ‘utterance’, ‘realization’, and ‘ranking’ which are not completely specified; their precise definition is left as a matter for empirical research, and may vary from language to language. A first goal of the work presented in this paper was to find which way of specifying these parameters, among the many proposed in the literature, would make the claims of centering theory most accurate as predictors of coherence and pronominalization for English. We did this by annotating a corpus of English texts with the sort of information required to implement some of the most popular variants of centering theory, and using this corpus to automatically check two central claims of the theory, the claim that all utterances have a looking center (Constraint 1), and the claim that if any discourse entity is pronomithe (Rule 1). In doing this, we tried to make sure we would only use information that could be annotated reliably. Our second goal was to evaluate the predictions of the theory in domains of interest for real applications–natural language generation, in our case. For this reason, we used texts in two genres not yet studied, but of interest to developers of instructional texts and descriptions of museum objects to be displayed on Web pages. The paper is organized as follows. We first review the basic notions of the theory. We then discuss the methods we used: our annotation method and how the annotation was used. In Section 4 we present the results of the study. A discussion of these results follows. 2 FUNDAMENTALS OF CENTERING THEORY Centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b) is an ‘object-centered’ theory of text coherence: it attempts to characterize the texts that can be considered coherent on the basis of the way discourse entities are introduced and dis- At the same time, it is also meant to a theory of i.e., it attempts to predict which entities will be most salient at any given time (which should be useful for a natural language generator, since it is these entities that are most typically pronominalized (Gundel et al., 1993)). to the theory, every a spoken dialogue or written text introduces into discourse a number of correspond more or less a discussion of ‘object-centered’ vs. ‘relationcentered’ notions of coherence, see (Stevenson et al., 2000). to discourse entities in the sense of (Karttunen, 1976; Webber, 1978; Heim, 1982), and can be to introduced by previous or successive utterances. Forward-looking centers are and because of this ranking, some acquire particular prominence. Among them, the CENTER defined as follows: Looking Center (CB) the CENTER utteris the highest ranked element of that is realized in is classified as a = and is the most ranked as a the remains the same, but it’s not any longer the most and as a zA The main claims of the theory are articulated in of constraints and rules on and 1: utterances of a segment except the 1st have exactly one 1: any pronominalized, the 2: of) continuations are preferred over (sequences of) retains, which are preferred over (sequences of) shifts Constraint 1 and Rule 2 express a preference for utterances in a text to talk about the same objects; Rule 1 is the main claim of the theory about pronominalization. In this paper we concentrate on Constraint 1 and Rule 1. One of the most unusual features of centering theory is that the notions of utterance, previous utterance, ranking, and realization used in the definitions above are left unspecified, to be appropriately defined on the basis of empirical evidence, and possibly in a different way for each language. As a result, centering theory is best viewed as a cluster of theories, each of which specifies the parameters in a different ways: e.g., ranking has been claimed to depend on grammatical function (Kameyama, 1985; Brennan et al., 1987), on thematic roles (Cote, 1998), and on the discourse staof the (Strube and Hahn, 1999); there are at least two definitions of what counts as ‘previous utterance’ (Kameyama, 1998; Suri and Mc- Coy, 1994); and ‘realization’ can be interpreted in a strict sense, i.e., by taking a be in an utterance only if an that utterdenotes that or in a looser sense, by also a ‘realized’ if it is referred to indirectly by means of a bridging reference (Clark, 1977), i.e., an anaphoric expression that refers to an object which wasn’t mentioned before but is somehow related to an object that already has, as vase handle e.g., the discussion in (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b)). 3 METHODS The fact that so many basic notions of centering theory do not have a completely specified definition makes empirical verification of the theory rather difficult. Because any attempt at directly annotating a corpus for ‘utterances’ and is bound to force the annotators to adopt some specification of the basic notions of the theory, previous studies have tended to study a particular variant of the theory (Di Eugenio, 1998; Kameyama, 1998; Passonneau, 1993; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Walker, 1989). A notable exception is (Tetreault, 1999), which used an annotated corpus to compare the performance of two variants of centering theory. The work discussed here, like Tetreault’s, is an attempt at using corpora to compare different versions of centering theory, but considering also parameters of centering theory not studied in this earlier work. In particular, we looked at different ways of defining the notion of utterance, we studied the definition of realization, and more generally the role of semantic information. We did this by annotating a corpus with information that has been claimed by one or the other version of centering theory to play a role in the definitions of its basic notions e.g., the grammatical function an anaphoric relations (including information about bridging references) and how sentences break up into clauses and subclausal units– and then tried to find out the best way of specifying these notions automatically, by trying out different configurations of parameters, and counting the number of violations of the constraints and rules that would result by adopting a particular parameter configuration. We used eight annotators for the reliability study and the annotation. The Data The aim of our project, which is called whose home page is at to develop algorithms whose generality is to be verified by incorporating in two distinct systems: the developed at the University of Edinburgh, that generates Web pages describing museum objects on the basis of the perceived status of its user’s knowledge and of the objects she previously looked at (Oberlander et al., 1998); and the developed at the University of Brighton, that supports the creation of patient information leaflets (Scott et al., 1998). The corpus we collected includes texts from both the domains we are studying. The texts in the museum domain consist of descriptions of museum objects and brief texts about the artists that produced them; the texts in the pharmaceutical domain are leaflets providing the patients with the legally mandatory information about their medicine. The total size of the corpus is of about 6,000 NPs. For this study we used about half of each subset, for a total number of 3,000 of which 103 are third person pronouns (72 in the museum domain, 31 in the pharmaceutical domain) and 61 are third-person possessive pronouns (58 in the museum domain, 3 in the pharmaceutical domain). Annotation Previous empirical studies of centering theory typically involved a single annotator annotating her corpus according to her own subjective judgment (Passonneau, 1993; Kameyama, 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999). One of our goals was to use for our study only information that could be annotated reliably (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Carletta, 1996), as we believe this will make our results easier to replicate. The price we paid to achieve replicability is that we couldn’t test all hypotheses proposed in the literature, especially about segmentation and about ranking. We discuss some of the problems in what follows. (The latest version of the annotation manual is from the home page.) (1998) noted that identifying utterances with sentences is problematic in the case of multiclausal sentences: e.g., grammatical function ranking becomes difficult to measure, as there may be more than one subject. She proposed to use all and only tensed clauses instead of sentences as utterance units, and then classified finite clauses into (i) utterance units that constitute a ’permanent’ update of the local focus: these include coordinated clauses and adjuncts) and (ii) utterance units that result in updates that are then erased, much as in the way the information provided by subordinated discourse segments is erased when they popped. Kameyama called these units, and proposed that clauses that serve as verbal complements behave this way. Suri and McCoy (1994) did a study that led them to propose that some types of adjuncts–in particuclauses headed by be treated as ‘embedded’ rather than as ‘permanent updates’ as suggested by Kameyama; these results were subsequently confirmed by more controlled experiments Pearson et al. (2000). Neither Kameyama nor Suri and McCoy discuss parentheticals; Kameyama only briefly mentions relative clauses, but doesn’t analyze them in detail. In order to evaluate these definitions of utterance (sentences versus finite clauses), as well as the different ways of defining ‘previous utterance’, we marked up in our corpus what we called These include clauses, as well as other sentence subconstituents which may be treated as separate utterances, including parenpreposed and (the second element coordinated The instructions for marking up units were in part derived from (Marcu, 1999); for each unit, the following attributes were marked: • whether the unit is a main clause, a relative clause, appositive, a parenthetical, etc. • whether the unit contains a verb or not. • for verbed units, whether the verb is finite or not. • for verbed units, whether they have a full subject, an empty subject (expletive, in or no subject (e.g., for infinitival clauses). The agreement on identifying the boundaries of using the discussed in (Carletta, was two annotators and 500 units); the agreement on features(2 annotators and at least 200 units) was follows: Attribute utype .76 verbed .9 finite .81 subject .86 instructions for identifying markderive from those proposed in the project scheme for annotating anaphoric relations (Poesio et al., 1999). We annotated attributes of which could be used to define their ranking, including: The proper name, etc.) A few other ‘basic’ syntactic features, and that could be used to identify contexts in which the antecedent of a pronoun could be identified unambiguously; The grammatical function, • whether the object denoted is animate or inanimate • whether the object is a deictic reference or not The agreement values for these attributes are as follows: Attribute ani .81 cat .9 deix .81 gen .89 gf .85 num .84 per .9 of the features of claimed to affect ranking (Sidner, 1979; Cote, 1998) that we haven’t so far been able to annotate because of failure to reach acceptable agreement is thematic roles information in order to whether a an utterance was realized directly or indirectly in the following utterance, we marked up anaphoric relations beagain using a variant of the scheme. Theories of focusing such as (Sidner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999), as well as our own early experiments with centering, suggested that indirect realization can play quite a crucial role in the however, previous work, parin the context of the suggested that while it’s fairly easy to achieve agreement on identity relations, marking up bridging references is quite hard; this was confirmed by, e.g., Poesio and Vieira (1998). As a result we did annotate this type of relations, but to achieve a reasonable agreement, and to contain somehow the annotators’ work, we limited the types of relations annotators were supposed to mark up, and we specified priorities. Thus, besides identity we only marked up three non-identity (‘bridging’ (Clark, 1977)) relations, and only relations between objects. The relations we mark up are a subset of those proposed in the ‘extended version of the (Poesio et 1999) and include set membership ELEsubset and ‘generalized poswhich includes part-of relations as well as more traditional ownership relations. As expected, we achieved a rather good agreement on identity relations. In our most recent analysis (two annotators looking at the anaphoric relations between 200 NPs) we observed no real disagreements; 79.4% of these relations were marked up by both annotators; 12.8% by only one of them; and in 7.7% of the cases, one of the annotators marked up a closer antecedent than the other. Concerning bridges, limiting the relations did limit the disagreements among annotators (only 4.8% of the relations are actually marked differently) but only 22% of bridging references were marked in the same way by both annotators; 73.17% of relations are marked by only one or the other annotator. So reaching agreement on this information involved several discussions between annotators and more than one pass over the corpus. text in a reliable fashion is still an open problem, and in addition the relation between centering (i.e., local focus shifts) and segmentation (i.e., global focus shifts) is still not clear: some see them as independent aspects of attentional structure, whereas other researchers define centering transitions with respect to segments (see, e.g., the discussion in the introduction to (Walker et al., 1998b)). Our preliminary experiments at annotating discourse structure didn’t give good results, either. Therefore, we only used the layout structure of the texts as a rough indication of discourse structure. In the museum domain, each object description was treated as a separate segment; in the pharmaceutical domain, each subsection of a leaflet was treated as a separate segment. We then identified by hand those violations of Constraint 1 that appeared to be motivated by too broad a segmentaof the Automatic computation of centering information The annotation thus produced was used to automatically compute utterances according to the particular configuration of parameters chosen, then to compute the and the any) of each utterance on the basis of the anaphoric information and according to the notion of ranking specified. This information was the used to find violations of Constraint 1 and Rule 1. The behavior of the script that computes this information depends on the following parameters: sentences, finite clauses, or verbed clauses should be treated as utterances. utterance: adjunct clauses should be treated Kameyama-style or Suri-style. CFs should be ranked according to grammatical function or discourse status in Strube and Hahn’s sense et al., 2000) showed that it is indeed possible to achieve good agreement on discourse segmentation, but that it requires intensive training and repeated iterations; we intend to take advantage of a corpus already annotated in this way in future work. only direct realization should be counted, or also indirect realization via bridging references. 4 MAIN RESULTS The principle we used to evaluate the different configurations of the theory was that the best definition of the parameters was the one that would lead to the fewest violations of Constraint 1 and Rule 1. We discuss the results for each principle. Constraint 1: All utterances of a segment except for the 1st have precisely one CB Our first set of figures concerns Constraint 1: many utterances have a This constraint can be used to evaluate how well centering theory predicts coherence, in the following sense: assuming that all our texts are coherent, if centering were the only factor behind coherence, all utterances should verify this constraint. The first table shows the results obtained by choosing the configuration that comes closest to the one suggested by Kameyama (1998): utterance=finite, prev=kameyama, rank=gf, realization=direct. The first column lists the number of utterances that satisfy Constraint 1; the second those that do not satisfy it, but are segment-initial; the third those that do not satisfy it and are not segment-initial. CB Segment Initial NO CB Total Number Museum 132 35 245 412 Pharmacy 158 13 198 369 Total 290 48 443 791 The previous table shows that with this configuration of parameters, most utterances do not satisfy Constraint 1 in the strict sense even if we take into account text segmentation (admittedly, a very rough one). If we take sentences as utterances, instead of finite clauses, we get fewer violations, although about 25% of the total number of utterances are violations: CB Segment Initial NO CB Total Number Museum 120 22 85 227 Pharmacy 152 8 51 211 Total 272 30 136 438 Using Suri and McCoy’s definition of previous utterance, instead of Kameyama’s (i.e., treating adjuncts as embedded utterances) leads to a slight improvement over Kameyama’s proposal but still not as good as using sentences: CB Segment Initial NO CB Total Number Museum 140 35 237 412 Pharmacy 167 14 188 369 Total 307 49 425 791 What about the finite clause types not considered by Kameyama or Suri and McCoy? It turns out that we get better results if we do not treat as utterances relative clauses (which anyway always a under standard syntactic assumptions about the presence of traces referring to the modified noun phrase), parentheticals, clauses that occur in subject position; and if we treat as a single utterance matrix clauses with empty subjects and complements (as in is possible that John arrive CB Segment Initial NO CB Total Number Museum 143 35 153 331 Pharmacy 161 14 159 334 Total 304 49 312 665 But by far the most significant improvement to the percentage of utterances that satisfy Constraint 1 comes by adopting a looser definition of ’realizes’, i.e., by allowing a discourse entity to serve an utterance even if it’s only referred to indirectly in that utterance by means of a bridging reference, as originally proposed by Sidner (1979) for her discourse focus. The following sequence of utterances explains why this could lead to fewer violations of Constraint 1: These “egg vases” are of exceptional quality: (u2) basketwork bases support bodies(u3) and bundles of straw handles,(u4) while small eggs resting straw nests serve as the finial for lid.(u5) vaseis decorated with inlaid decoration: . . . In (1), u1 is followed by four utterances. Only the last of these directly refers to the set of egg vases introduced in u1, while they all contain implicit references to these objects. If we adopt this looser notion of realization, the figures improve dramatically, even with the rather restricted set of relations on which our annotators agree. Now the majority of utterances satisfy Constraint 1: CB Segment Initial NO CB Total Number Museum 225 35 71 331 Pharmacy 174 14 146 334 Total 399 49 217 665 And of course we get even better results by treating sentences as utterances: CB Segment Initial NO CB Total Number Museum 171 17 39 227 Pharmacy 168 7 36 211 Total 339 24 75 438 It is important, however, to notice that even under the best configuration, at least 17% of utterances violate the constraint. The (possibly, obvious) explanation is that although coherence is often achieved by means of links between objects, this is not the only way to make texts coherent. So, in the museum domain, we find utterances do not refer to any of the previous because they express generic statements about the class of objects of which the object under discussion is an instance, or viceversa utterances that make a generic point that will then be illustrated by a specific object. In the following example, the second utterance gives some background concerning the decoration of a particular object. (2) (u1) On the drawer above the door, gilt-bronze military trophies flank a medallion portrait of Louis XIV. (u2) In the Dutch Wars of 1672 - 1678, France fought simultaneously against the Dutch, Spanish, and Imperial armies, defeating them all. (u3) This cabinet celebrates the Treaty of Nijmegen, which concluded the war. Coherence can also be achieved by explicit relations, such as EXEMPLIFICAthe following example: (3) (u1) Jewelry is often worn to signal membership of a particular social group. (u2) The Beatles brooch shown previously is another case in point: Rule 1: if any NP is pronominalized, the CB is In the previous section we saw that allowing references to maintain the to fewer violations of Constraint 1. One should not, however, immediately conclude that it would be a good idea to replace the strict definition of ’realizes’ with a looser one, because there is, unfortunately, a side effect: adopting an indirect notion of realizes leads to more violations of Rule 1. Figures are as follows. Using utterance=s, rank=gf, realizes=direct 22 pronouns violating Rule 1 (9 museum, 13 pharmacy) (13.4%), whereas with realizes=indirect we have 38 violations (25, 13) (23%); if we choose utterance=finite, prev=suri, we have 23 violations of rule 1 with realizes=direct (13 + 10) (14%), 32 with realizes=indirect (21 + 11) (19.5%). Using functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to the led to no improvements, because of the almost perfect correlation in our domain between subjecthood and being discourse-old. One reason for these problems is illustrated by (4). (4) (u1) A great refinement among armorial signets was to reproduce not only the coat-of-arms but the correct tinctures; (u2) they were repeated in colour on the reverse side (u3) and the crystal would then be set in the gold bezel. u2 refers back to correct tinctures which however only occurs in object position in a (non-finite) complement clause in (u1), and therefore has lower than which is realized (u2) by the bridge reverse side therebecomes the higher rank in (u1), but is not pronominalized. In the pharmaceutical leaflets we found a number of violations of Rule 1 towards the end of texts, when the product is referred to. A possible explanation is that after the product has been mentioned sentence after sentence in the text, by the end of the text it is salient enough that there is no need to put it again in the local focus by it explicitly. E.g., the following example refers to the cream, not mentioned in any of the previous two utterances. (5) (u1) A child of 4 years needs about a third of the adult amount. (u2) A course of treatment for a child should not normally last more than five days (u3) unless your doctor has told you to use it for longer. 5 DISCUSSION Our main result is that there seems to be a tradeoff between Constraint 1 and Rule 1. Allowing a definition of ’realizes’ that makes the behave more like Sidner’s Discourse Focus (Sidner, 1979) leads to a very significant reduction in the of violations of Constraint We also noted, however, that interpreting ‘realizes’ in this way results in more violations of Rule 1. (No differences were found when functional centerwas used to rank instead of grammati- 2, page 3 of the intro to (Walker et al., 1998b) suggests a weaker interpretation for the Constraint: ‘there is more than one utterance’. This weaker form of the Constraint does hold for most utterances, but it’s almost vacuous, especially for grammatical function ranking, given that utterances have at most one subject. cal function.) The problem raised by these results is that whereas centering is intended as an account of both coherence and local salience, different concepts may have to be used in Constraint 1 and Rule 1, as in Sidner’s theory. E.g., we might have a ‘Center of Coherence’, analogous to Sidner’s discourse focus, and that can be realized indirectly; and a ‘Center of Salience’, similar to her actor focus, and that can only be realized directly. Constraint 1 would be about the Center of Coherence, whereas Rule 1 would be about the Center of Salience. Indeed, many versions of centering have elevated the the rank of a sec- We also saw that texts can be coherent even when Constraint 1 is violated, as coherence can be ensured by other means (e.g., by rhetorical relations). This, again, suggests possible revisions to Constraint 1, requiring every utterance either to have a center of coherence, or to be linked by a rhetorical relation to the previous utterance. Finally, we saw that we get fewer violations of Constraint 1 by adopting sentences as our notion of utterance; however, again, this results in more violations of Rule 1. If finite clauses are used as utterances, we found that certain types of finite clauses not previously discussed, including relative clauses and matrix clauses with empty subjects, are best not treated as utterances. We didn’t find significant differences between Kameyama and Suri and McCoy’s definition of ‘previous utterance’. We believe however more work is still needed to identify a completely satisfactory way of breaking up sentences in utterance units. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</abstract>

Annotation Previous empirical studies of centering theory typically involved a single annotator annotating her corpus according to her own subjective judgment (Passonneau, 1993; Kameyama, 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999). One of our goals was to use for our study only information that could be annotated reliably (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Carletta, 1996), as we believe this will make our results easier to replicate. The price we paid to achieve replicability is that we couldn’t test all hypotheses proposed in the literature, especially about segmentation and about ranking. We discuss some of the problems in what follows. (The latest version of the annotation manual is available from the GNOME project’s home page.)

The instructions for marking up units were in part derived from (Marcu, 1999); for each unit, the following attributes were marked: • utype: whether the unit is a main clause, a relative clause, appositive, a parenthetical, etc. • verbed: whether the unit contains a verb or not. • finite: for verbed units, whether the verb is finite or not. • subject: for verbed units, whether they have a full subject, an empty subject (expletive, as in there sentences), or no subject (e.g., for infinitival clauses). The agreement on identifying the boundaries of units, using the K statistic discussed in (Carletta, 1996), was K _ .9 (for two annotators and 500 units); the agreement on features(2 annotators and at least 200 units) was follows: Attribute K Value utype .76 verbed .9 finite .81 subject .86 NPs Our instructions for identifying NP markables derive from those proposed in the MATE project scheme for annotating anaphoric relations (Poesio et al., 1999).

As a result we did annotate this type of relations, but to achieve a reasonable agreement, and to contain somehow the annotators’ work, we limited the types of relations annotators were supposed to mark up, and we specified priorities. Thus, besides identity (IDENT) we only marked up three non-identity (‘bridging’ (Clark, 1977)) relations, and only relations between objects. The relations we mark up are a subset of those proposed in the ‘extended relations’ version of the MATE scheme (Poesio et al., 1999) and include set membership (ELEMENT), ELEMENT), subset (SUBSET), and ‘generalized possession’ (POSS), which includes part-of relations as well as more traditional ownership relations. As expected, we achieved a rather good agreement on identity relations.

We attempted to find the best way of defining each such notion among those that can be annotated reliably, and using a corpus of texts in two domains of practical interest. Our main result is that trying to reduce the number of utterances without a backwardlooking center (CB) results in an increased number of cases in which some discourse entity, but not the CB, gets pronominalized, and viceversa. 1 MOTIVATION Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b) is best characterized as a ‘parametric’ theory: its key definitions and claims involve notions such as ‘utterance’, ‘realization’, and ‘ranking’ which are not completely specified; their precise definition is left as a matter for empirical research, and may vary from language to language. A first goal of the work presented in this paper was to find which way of specifying these parameters, among the many proposed in the literature, would make the claims of centering theory most accurate as predictors of coherence and pronominalization for English.

For this reason, we used texts in two genres not yet studied, but of interest to developers of NLG systems: instructional texts and descriptions of museum objects to be displayed on Web pages. The paper is organized as follows. We first review the basic notions of the theory. We then discuss the methods we used: our annotation method and how the annotation was used. In Section 4 we present the results of the study. A discussion of these results follows. 2 FUNDAMENTALS OF CENTERING THEORY Centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b) is an ‘object-centered’ theory of text coherence: it attempts to characterize the texts that can be considered coherent on the basis of the way discourse entities are introduced and discussed.1 At the same time, it is also meant to be a theory of salience: i.e., it attempts to predict which entities will be most salient at any given time (which should be useful for a natural language generator, since it is these entities that are most typically pronominalized (Gundel et al., 1993)).

One of the most unusual features of centering theory is that the notions of utterance, previous utterance, ranking, and realization used in the definitions above are left unspecified, to be appropriately defined on the basis of empirical evidence, and possibly in a different way for each language. As a result, centering theory is best viewed as a cluster of theories, each of which specifies the parameters in a different ways: e.g., ranking has been claimed to depend on grammatical function (Kameyama, 1985; Brennan et al., 1987), on thematic roles (Cote, 1998), and on the discourse status of the CFs (Strube and Hahn, 1999); there are at least two definitions of what counts as ‘previous utterance’ (Kameyama, 1998; Suri and McCoy, 1994); and ‘realization’ can be interpreted either in a strict sense, i.e., by taking a CF to be realized in an utterance only if an NP in that utterance denotes that CF, or in a looser sense, by also counting a CF as ‘realized’ if it is referred to indirectly by means of a bridging reference (Clark, 1977), i.e., an anaphoric expression that refers to an object which wa</context>

Annotation Previous empirical studies of centering theory typically involved a single annotator annotating her corpus according to her own subjective judgment (Passonneau, 1993; Kameyama, 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999). One of our goals was to use for our study only information that could be annotated reliably (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Carletta, 1996), as we believe this will make our results easier to replicate. The price we paid to achieve replicability is that we couldn’t test all hypotheses proposed in the literature, especially about segmentation and about ranking.

Constraint 1: All utterances of a segment except for the 1st have precisely one CB Our first set of figures concerns Constraint 1: how many utterances have a CB. This constraint can be used to evaluate how well centering theory predicts coherence, in the following sense: assuming that all our texts are coherent, if centering were the only factor behind coherence, all utterances should verify this constraint. The first table shows the results obtained by choosing the configuration that comes closest to the one suggested by Kameyama (1998): utterance=finite, prev=kameyama, rank=gf, realization=direct. The first column lists the number of utterances that satisfy Constraint 1; the second those that do not satisfy it, but are segment-initial; the third those that do not satisfy it and are not segment-initial.

The instructions for marking up units were in part derived from (Marcu, 1999); for each unit, the following attributes were marked: • utype: whether the unit is a main clause, a relative clause, appositive, a parenthetical, etc. • verbed: whether the unit contains a verb or not. • finite: for verbed units, whether the verb is finite or not. • subject: for verbed units, whether they have a full subject, an empty subject (expletive, as in there sentences), or no subject (e.g., for infinitival clauses).

Because any attempt at directly annotating a corpus for ‘utterances’ and their CBs is bound to force the annotators to adopt some specification of the basic notions of the theory, previous studies have tended to study a particular variant of the theory (Di Eugenio, 1998; Kameyama, 1998; Passonneau, 1993; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Walker, 1989). A notable exception is (Tetreault, 1999), which used an annotated corpus to compare the performance of two variants of centering theory. The work discussed here, like Tetreault’s, is an attempt at using corpora to compare different versions of centering theory, but considering also parameters of centering theory not studied in this earlier work. In particular, we looked at different ways of defining the notion of utterance, we studied the definition of realization, and more generally the role of semantic information. We did this by annotating a corpus wi</context>

Kameyama called these EMBEDDED utterance units, and proposed that clauses that serve as verbal complements behave this way. Suri and McCoy (1994) did a study that led them to propose that some types of adjuncts–in particular, clauses headed by after and before–should be treated as ‘embedded’ rather than as ‘permanent updates’ as suggested by Kameyama; these results were subsequently confirmed by more controlled experiments Pearson et al. (2000). Neither Kameyama nor Suri and McCoy discuss parentheticals; Kameyama only briefly mentions relative clauses, but doesn’t analyze them in detail.

Theories of focusing such as (Sidner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999), as well as our own early experiments with centering, suggested that indirect realization can play quite a crucial role in maintaining the CB; however, previous work, particularly in the context of the MUC initiative, suggested that while it’s fairly easy to achieve agreement on identity relations, marking up bridging references is quite hard; this was confirmed by, e.g., Poesio and Vieira (1998). As a result we did annotate this type of relations, but to achieve a reasonable agreement, and to contain somehow the annotators’ work, we limited the types of relations annotators were supposed to mark up, and we specified priorities.

The following sequence of utterances explains why this could lead to fewer violations of Constraint 1: (1) (u1) These “egg vases” are of exceptional quality: (u2) basketwork bases support egg-shaped bodies (u3) and bundles of straw form the handles, (u4) while small eggs resting in straw nests serve as the finial for each lid.

(u2) A course of treatment for a child should not normally last more than five days (u3) unless your doctor has told you to use it for longer. 5 DISCUSSION Our main result is that there seems to be a tradeoff between Constraint 1 and Rule 1. Allowing for a definition of ’realizes’ that makes the CB behave more like Sidner’s Discourse Focus (Sidner, 1979) leads to a very significant reduction in the number of violations of Constraint 1.3 We also noted, however, that interpreting ‘realizes’ in this way results in more violations of Rule 1.

As a result, centering theory is best viewed as a cluster of theories, each of which specifies the parameters in a different ways: e.g., ranking has been claimed to depend on grammatical function (Kameyama, 1985; Brennan et al., 1987), on thematic roles (Cote, 1998), and on the discourse status of the CFs (Strube and Hahn, 1999); there are at least two definitions of what counts as ‘previous utterance’ (Kameyama, 1998; Suri and McCoy, 1994); and ‘realization’ can be interpreted either in a strict sense, i.e., by taking a CF to be realized in an utterance only if an NP in that utterance denotes that CF, or in a looser sense, by also counting a CF as ‘realized’ if it is referred to indirectly by means of a bridging reference (Clark, 1977), i.e., an anaphoric expression that refers to an object which wasn’t mentioned before but is somehow related to an object that already has, as in the vase ... the handle (see, e.g., t</context>

The total size of the corpus is of about 6,000 NPs. For this study we used about half of each subset, for a total number of about 3,000 NPs, of which 103 are third person pronouns (72 in the museum domain, 31 in the pharmaceutical domain) and 61 are third-person possessive pronouns (58 in the museum domain, 3 in the pharmaceutical domain). Annotation Previous empirical studies of centering theory typically involved a single annotator annotating her corpus according to her own subjective judgment (Passonneau, 1993; Kameyama, 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999). One of our goals was to use for our study only information that could be annotated reliably (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Carletta, 1996), as we believe this will make our results easier to replicate. The price we paid to achieve replicability is that we couldn’t test all hypotheses proposed in the literature, especially about segmentation and about ranking. We discuss some of the problems in what follows. (The latest version of the annotation manual is available from the GNOME project’s home page.)

As a result we did annotate this type of relations, but to achieve a reasonable agreement, and to contain somehow the annotators’ work, we limited the types of relations annotators were supposed to </context>

Figures are as follows. Using utterance=s, rank=gf, realizes=direct 22 pronouns violating Rule 1 (9 museum, 13 pharmacy) (13.4%), whereas with realizes=indirect we have 38 violations (25, 13) (23%); if we choose utterance=finite, prev=suri, we have 23 violations of rule 1 with realizes=direct (13 + 10) (14%), 32 with realizes=indirect (21 + 11) (19.5%). Using functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to rank the CFs led to no improvements, because of the almost perfect correlation in our domain between subjecthood and being discourse-old.

Kameyama called these EMBEDDED utterance units, and proposed that clauses that serve as verbal complements behave this way. Suri and McCoy (1994) did a study that led them to propose that some types of adjuncts–in particular, clauses headed by after and before–should be treated as ‘embedded’ rather than as ‘permanent updates’ as suggested by Kameyama; these results were subsequently confirmed by more controlled experiments Pearson et al.
