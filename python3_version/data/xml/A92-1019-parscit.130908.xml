Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999964633333334">
This paper reports on the development of
DILEMMA-2*, a lemmatizer-tagger for the
sublanguage of medical abstracts. The program
is an extension of DILEMMA-1, a lemmatizer-
tagger for general English texts.
In the first section a brief outline is given
of DILEMMA-1. Particular attention is paid to
the original concept of a default category which
is linked with a categorial graph by means of a
pointer system. In the second section we show
why DILEMMA-1 was not able to get a
suitable score when lemmatizing medical
abstracts, the main reason being the inability to
recognize sublanguage specific vocabulary. In
the next section a description is given of the
most important errors along with their
solutions; these errors are then categorized as
gaps or wrong assignments. The former could
be dealt with in either a suffix list or a gaps
filler default. The latter mainly concerned
wrongly assigned past participles and errors on
noun, verb or adjective assignment.
After implementation of the proposed
solutions, a comparison is made between the
results of DILEMMA-1 and DILEMMA-2,
showing that the results of DILEMMA-1 have
been improved substantially within a
sublanguage context, and this by using
linguistic, i.e. sublanguage, knowledge, thus
avoiding ad hoc remedies.

In this paper we describe DILEMMA-2, a lemmatizer-
tagger for medical abstracts, which is an updated version of
DILEMMA-1, a lemmatizer-tagger for general texts. After
a brief outline of DILEMMA-1 we give a description of
the types of errors we found when running the general
lemmatizer on medical abstracts. This is followed by some
examples of the solutions we proposed and implemented
into DILEMMA-2. Finally, the results of DILEMMA-1
and DILEMMA-2 are compared, showing that a
sublanguage approach can lead to workable results in the
development of real world applications.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979144">
DILEMMA-1 is an automatic lemmatizer-tagger for
general English texts, developed at the University of
Antwerp during the academic year 1985-1986 (see
[MARTIN 881A). For each word of the text it tries to find
its lemma (or dictionary entry form) and its grammatical
category, and subcategories (or specifiers) where necessary.
Being a lemmatizer, not a parser, DILEMMA-1 is as
such limited to a relatively basic level of syntactic
analysis, which however can be used as input to a more
powerful syntactic analyzer. In this way, a lemmatizer can
be considered an invaluable tool for corpus linguistics.
To carry out the task of assigning grammar
categories and possible specifiers DILEMMA-1 looks at
word forms from four different points-of-view. First of all
word forms are looked at out-of-context (dictionary look-
up, morphological procedures). In a second step the
immediate context is taken into account: word forms are
analyzed and checked by looking at the words immediately
preceding and following them. In a third step, the proto-
syntactic module, a larger context (such as verb patterns)
is taken into account. Finally, in the temporary memory,
word forms are checked by looking at the whole text.
Like most modern lemmatizers, DILEMMA-1 uses
as much linguistic knowledge as possible, by translating
any regularity on the lexico-morphological level into

<bodyText confidence="0.999617083333333">
rules, thus keeping the dictionary small. But in the case of
DILEMMA-1 the size of the dictionary is extremely small
when compared to other lemmatizer-taggers: a little over
3600 words. For a comparison between DILEMMA-1 and
CLAWS, another well-known, lemmatizer-tagger for
English, see [MARTIN 88b]. In passing it can be noted
that DILEMMA-1 uses a dictionary only half the size of
that used in CLAWS. This smallness is due to criteria
adopted on the macro- and micro-level of the dictionary.
The vertical macro-level is concerned with the words to
select as entry, whereas the horizontal micro-level deals
with the information to store next to the dictionary entry.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.8745286">
On the macro-level, the dictionary entries are selected
according to the following three principles: frequency,
closure (of classes, e.g. prepositions) and irregularity (e.g.
irregular verbs, irregular plurals). In other words, the
dictionary only contains words which are either frequent or
which belong to closed classes or which cannot be deduced
from the grammar of the English language. To construct
the list of frequent words, we used Van Dale&apos;s English-
Dutch Dictionary ([MARTIN 891), where very frequent
words are labeled F4 or F3. These frequency codes were the
result of an earlier research project ([MARTIN 83],
[MARTIN 88a]).
On the micro-level, categorial information is stored
preferentially. Each word is given a preferential default
category which can shift to other categories along a
categorial graph manipulated by the program (see Fig. 1).
This way of storing categorial information is based on the
fact that DILEMMA-1 also tries to look for regularity in
the categories words can have, and that is what makes it so
different from other lemmatizers.

<tableCaption confidence="0.997859">
Table 1: part of the DILEMMA dictionary

<bodyText confidence="0.947284631578947">
Being a morphologically poor language, English has
a large number of grammatical homonyms. DILEMMA-I
starts from the assumption (i) that English words can have
different categories, (ii) that each word has a default
category (DC), and (iii) that the necessary categorial shifts
can be systematized. The DC, which is the main category
of a word, is established on the basis offrequency, analogy
and/or meaning. Next to a DC, each word in the dictionary
(see Table 1) has a pointer (left, right or neither) indicating
the direction in which a category can shift through a
categorial graph which was established after calculating the
combination and frequency of categories. The word &amp;quot;kiss&amp;quot;,
for example, has the category &apos;verb&apos; as DC, and can shift
&apos;right&apos; to the &apos;noun&apos; category. All categorial shifts are
guided by condition-action rules in the rule component of
the DILEMMA-1-program. Note also that the categories
&apos;numeral&apos; and &apos; int e r ject ion&apos; are not integrated in
the graph. The numeral only has a predecessor, viz, noun;
the interjection has neither a predecessor nor a successor.

<bodyText confidence="0.992646571428571">
The use of categorial information and pointers
changes the dictionary into an economical and dynamic set
of lexemes. This is maybe the most striking feature of the
modular architecture of DILEMMA-1, and it explains also
why the program can run even within a PC-environment.
For a fuller account of the DILEMMA-1-program we refer
to [MARTIN 88b].

An output sample of DILEMMA-1 is shown in
Table 2, which is a sentence from the BROWN-corpus
(see [KUCERA 67]). The first column is the text, the
second is the lemmatized form, and the following columns
give the category and possible specifiers. When a word is
not recognized, or when recognition is doubtful, it is
flagged by a double asterisk.
DILEMMA-1 was tested on a number of general
language text samples and proved to be a very powerful
tool. A sample of error analysis on 6 texts taken from a
standard British English corpus (the LOB corpus
[JOHANSSON 78]) shows e.g. that for general language
texts, DILEMMA-1&apos;s success rate does not drop below
90%, nor does it exceed 97%, on the average leading to a
score of ± 93.50% (see Table 3).

Nevertheless, when DILEMMA-1 was tested on a
number of medical abstracts, its scoring reference point of
93.50% was not reached at all. &apos;Best results&apos; were more
likely to lie within the 90% area, the average being about
86% (see Table 6). The object of this research project was
how to bring back the success rate for lemmatizing
medical abstracts, without changing the philosophy behind
the DILEMMA-1-program, which is developed as a
robust, preferential, dynamic system in which items can
take different values governed by constraints. Moreover, in
a language such as English, categories are often functional
instead of lexical (which explains, in part, the small size
of the lexicon).

2 A Sublanguage Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983124890909091">
When running the DILEMMA-1 program on medical
abstracts, we found that most errors are related to the
sublanguage of medical abstracts. For example, most gaps
in the output are due to a lack of sublanguage specific
vocabulary in the DILEMMA-1 dictionary: e.g. astrocyte,
fibrillary, acidic, GFAP. Another point which supports
the idea of sublanguage influence is that the more abstracts
resemble general language texts, the more their results lie
within the general language area. In an extreme case there
was only one error in a text of 42 words (success rate =
97.62%). Very unlike the average medical abstract, this
text showed no symbols or abbreviations, and it had short,
non-complex sentence structures. For a fuller account of
lexical differences between sublanguage and general
language lexicons, see [MCNAUGHT 91].
An example showing that the sublanguage features
are not solely confined to the lexical level is the following
sentence, where &apos;counts&apos; — which can be either &apos;verb&apos;
or `noun&apos; — must shift from &apos;verb&apos; to &apos;noun&apos; when
found at the beginning of a sentence:
e.g. Counts of neocortical cells did not
reveal differences in cell numbers.
This categorial shift is a sublanguage shift, as
categorial and syntactic ambiguity does not exist here, i.e.
sentence initial verbal constructions such as imperatives
and questions do not occur in the sublanguage of medical
abstracts.
To improve the DILEMMA-1 program, we not only
tried to tackle the problems from a sublanguage approach,
but we also decided to implement all program adaptations
in a separate module which can be called up by the user
whenever he wants. Such a modular architecture makes it
easier to adapt the program to another sublanguage.
Although not new, the sublanguage approach is
being adopted more and more in the implementation of
real world applications, where computational linguists are
constantly confronted with how to organize the vast
amount of world knowledge. The domains can be very
diverse as can be seen in the examples of
[CHEVALIER 78] (automatic translation of weather
forecasts), [DEVILLE 89] (automatic man-machine
dialogue system handling requests for administrative
information) and [PALMER 90] (physics world problems
for college students involving pulley systems). Only by
strictly defining the limits of the application domain can
one write programs without having to resort to brute force
techniques.
Even if we stress the sublinguistic character of the
errors in the DILEMMA-1 output, there were of course
also a number of general errors, most of which could not
be solved within the context of the DILEMMA-1
framework which presupposes no (clause) syntactic
knowledge. In the rest of this paper we will focus our
attention on the modifications added at the sublanguage
level.

<bodyText confidence="0.89238475">
DILEMMA-2 is the result of the corrections we made to
DILEMMA-1 within the context of medical abstracts. The
type of errors encountered were either gaps or wrong
assignments (see Table 6 at the end of this section).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99633">
3.1 Gaps
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999755666666667">
As explained in section 2, most gaps were sublanguage
specific words. Putting the missing scientific terms in the
dictionary was not considered a good solution: this would
have been against the basic principle of the DILEMMA
concept, which was to keep the dictionary as small as
possible; in any case, it would have been a practically
impossible task (ESP has a database of more than 100.000
scientific terms). In as far as the missing terms showed
some regularity at the lexico-morphological and syntactic
level, they could be dealt with outside the dictionary, by
using a sublanguage specific suffix list and a sublanguage
specific gaps filler default. The former has been arrived at
by considering medical sublanguage from a broad point-of-
view, situating it within the functional domain of
scientific writing. Table 4 gives a sample of scientific
suffixes which have categorial power and which are typical
for the formation of medical terms in a broad sense of the
term.

<bodyText confidence="0.999791666666667">
As to the default for the remaining gaps, it became
apparent from the sample analysis that medical texts, like
most scientific texts, heavily nominalize. As a result, we
expect remaining gaps to be (part of) NPs. Given the
contents of the existing DILEMMA dictionary this leads
us to a choice between (predominantly) nouns and
adjectives. Therefore, only in a last module is
DILEMMA-2 allowed to fill out all remaining gaps as
nouns unless these gaps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8219625">
(a) occur in prototypical patterns for
adjectives such as (Pron is mentioned
here, because it has not been shifted to
Det):

<listItem confidence="0.912226333333333">

shifted to Adjective. These are typical
endings which can also yield adjectives
and/or verbs.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768666666667">
In these cases the gaps remain unfilled and are flagged
for further processing by a higher module, such as a clause
module or a syntactic parser.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999734">
3.2 Wrong Assignments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998954757575757">
Although wrong assignments are far less frequent than
gaps, they can be important in so far as they can give rise
to wrong results in further processing (e.g. in establishing
NPs), and in so far as they are no longer easily
recoverable. The most important of these errors are related
to either those cases where specification of simple past oi
past participle is difficult to distinguish, or to errors
concerning noun, verb or adjective assignment. Anothei
problem, we will not deal with in this paper, is the ample
use of differently structured abbreviations, such as: MH
VAHR, b.i.d., mRna. These were handled by an
abbreviations procedure.
A major problem, well known in English tagging
and so not only restricted to medical texts, is the wrong
specification of verbs which can be either simple past a
past participle. As long as the specifier is no
disambiguated, it is referred to as PAST_PAPA. In thc
following example both &apos;revealed&apos; and &apos;increased&apos; wen
assigned PAST, whereas &apos;increased&apos; should have beer
assigned PAPA:
e.g. Western blot analysis revealed
increased levels of GFAP in Mo(br/y)
forebrain and cerebellum.
In the context of another ESP project on automatic
indexing of medical abstracts, it is important to correctl
delineate NPs and therefore to recognize PAPA&apos; s
However, within the framework of a lemmatizer-tagge
this is not an easy task. Again, a sublanguage approach i
of great help here. Attributive PAPA&apos; s in ou
sublanguage occur much more often than in genera
English texts. Consequently, in some very strictly define(
contexts we could partly disambiguate the PAST_PAP1
problem, as in the following three examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.970115666666667">
(a) When a PAST_PAPA is preceded by an
ING-form and followed by a noun, select
PAPA: e.g. physicians are expressing
increased willingness.
(b) When a PAST_PAPA is preceded by a
noun and followed by a preposition or a
particle, select PAPA: e.g. cells isolated
from ...
(c) When a PAST_PAPA is found at the
beginning of a sentence, select PAPA: e.g.
Affected males suffer profound deficits in
oxidative metabolism.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.927756666666667">
Each case was implemented in a condition-actioi
rule, so that example (a), when written as a C-function
looks as follows:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.97721">
144
</page>
<equation confidence="0.882501833333333">
if ((thisspec == Cr_past)
&amp;&amp; (this101.spec2 == C_papa)
&amp;&amp; (prevspec == C_ing)
&amp;&amp; (nextcat == C_noun))
thisspec = C_papa;
this[0).spec2 = C_nullspec;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.605272368421053">
This function states that
if
the specifier of the selected
word is C_past
and it has an alternative
specifier C_papa
and the specifier of the preceding
word is C_ing
and the category of the next word
is C_noun
then
change the specifier of the
selected word into C_papa
and eliminate the alternative specifier
As stated above, our proposal of PAST_PAPA rules
was based on observations of the Elsevier corpus of
medical abstracts at our disposal. We found that the
contexts in which wrongly coded attributive PAPA&apos;s occur,
can — as a rule — be characterized as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9449516">
(a) object NPs following a verb (e.g. and
have found marked changes);
(b) NPS not (directly) following a verb (e.g.
once in individual association and once in
a combine,d,fixed preparation);
(c) complex NPs (e.g. after a co-ordinating
conjunction);
(c) subject NPs at the beginning of sentence
(e.g. Affected males suffer profound
deficits ...).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987835">
In the case of errors concerning noun, verb or
adjective assignment, we encountered similar context
problems, and again, only in very strict contexts could a
rule be applied.

In this paper we have shown that it is possible to adapt a
general lemmatizer-tagger for the specific purpose of
lemmatizing medical abstracts, and this by using
linguistic knowledge, rather than any ad hoc solutions.
A dynamic, preferential, and constraint-based system
with a very small dictionary such as DILEMMA-1 lends
itself particularly well to such an adaptation, as no
massive lexical importation is necessary, although it
looks like that at first sight. Instead, mainly
morphological and syntactic sublanguage knowledge has
been made use of, leading to a sublanguage suffix list, a
sublanguage default procedure and improved functions of

PAST PAPA specifiers. The program was modified
modularly so that adaptations to other sublanguages could
easily be carried out. In this way DILEMMA-2 is at
present used as an invaluable pre-processor for an abstracts
indexing program at Elsevier Science Publishers,
Amsterdam. It should be clear that, generally speaking,
lemmatizing-tagging performance correlates in a positive
way with indexing and information retrieval in that it
paves the way for finding NPs (as possible index terms)
and that it abstracts away from inflectional variation (thus
covering morphological variants in search words).
Although some minor corrections are still possible
(for example in the lemmatizing procedures), we believe
that DILEMMA-1 cannot reach a higher score within the
limits it is conceived for. Interestingly, improvements are
possible &apos;horizontally&apos;, thus allowing extensions for other
sublanguages; further &apos;vertical&apos; refmements should be left
to more powerful tools. On the other hand, by bringing in
more flags to signal uncertainties, DILEMMA-2 could
reach, with some small guided post-editing effort, a near-
perfect score.

<abstract confidence="0.999916709677419">This paper reports on the development of a lemmatizer-tagger for the abstracts. program is an extension of DILEMMA-1, a lemmatizerfor texts. In the first section a brief outline is given of DILEMMA-1. Particular attention is paid to original concept of a category linked with a graph means of a pointer system. In the second section we show why DILEMMA-1 was not able to get a suitable score when lemmatizing medical abstracts, the main reason being the inability to specific vocabulary. the next section a description is given of the most important errors along with their solutions; these errors are then categorized as assignments. former could dealt with in either a a default. latter mainly concerned wrongly assigned past participles and errors on noun, verb or adjective assignment. After implementation of the proposed solutions, a comparison is made between the results of DILEMMA-1 and DILEMMA-2, showing that the results of DILEMMA-1 have been improved substantially within a sublanguage context, and this by using linguistic, i.e. sublanguage, knowledge, thus avoiding ad hoc remedies.</abstract>
<note confidence="0.857498">DILEMMA-2 was developed as part of a research contract Science Publishers Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The development of DILEMMA-1 was out as part of contract research for Dale Utrecht, The Netherlands.</note>
