Recent research in anaphora resolution has emphasized the effects of discourse
structure and cohesion in determining what concepts are available as possible referents, and
how discourse cohesion can aid reference resolution. Five approaches, all within this
paradigm and yet all distinctly different, are presented, and their strengths and weaknesses
evaluated.

<bodyText confidence="0.999935045454545">
To resolve various forms of definite reference —
anaphora in particular — early natural language un-
derstanding systems (reviewed in Hirst 1981) typically
used a simple kind of history list of concepts previous-
ly mentioned in the input, with heuristics for selecting
from this list. The history list was usually just a shift
register containing the noun phrases from the last sen-
tence or two, and the heuristics would take into ac-
count (among other things) selectional restrictions and
syntactic constraints on pronominalization. SHRDLU
(Winograd 1972) exemplifies this approach. Although
able to resolve some types of reference, these systems
were not able to handle reference in general, primarily
because they did not take into account the effects of
discourse structure on reference and pronominaliza-
tion. This failure motivated work in computational
discourse understanding that attempted to exploit dis-
course structure, especially the relationship between
reference and discourse theme, to resolve definite ref-
erence.
The present paper&apos; is a review of recent work in
this area. Five principal approaches are surveyed:

<listItem confidence="0.99757205882353">
1. Concept activatedness (Kantor) — an ex-
amination of the factors affecting the
pronominalizability of a concept;
2. Task-oriented dialogues (Grosz) — using
a priori knowledge of discourse structure
to resolve references;
3. Frames as focus (Sidner) — using dis-
course cues to choose a frame from a
knowledge structure to act as focus;
4. Logical formalism (Webber) — choosing a
predicate calculus-like representation to
handle problems such as quantification in
reference resolution;
5. Discourse cohesion (Hobbs, Lockman, and
others) — building a focus and resolving
reference by discovering the cohesive ties
in a text.

Some preliminary definitions: By focus we mean
the set containing exactly those concepts available for
anaphoric or other definite reference at a point in a
text, a set which may conveniently be divided into
parts for nominal concepts, temporal concepts, verbal
concepts and so forth.2 The focus is closely related to,
but not necessarily identical to, the theme of a dis-
course — what the discourse is about — and since the
latter is also sometimes termed focus, there is some
terminological confusion. (See Section 2.6 and Chap-
ter 4 of Hirst 1981 for further discussion of the dis-
tinction between theme and focus.)
Strictly speaking, we mean by the referent of an
anaphor or reference the real-world entity that it spec-
ifies, while by antecedent we mean the textual item
through which the reference is made. In (1-1):

Robert Kantor (1977) has investigated the problem
of why some pronouns in discourse are more compre-
hensible than others, even when there is no ambiguity
or anomaly. In Kantor&apos;s terms, a hard-to-understand
pronoun is an example of inconsiderate discourse, and
speakers (or, more usually, writers) who produce such
pronouns lack secondary [linguistic] competence. In our
terms, an inconsiderate pronoun is one that is not
properly in focus.
I will first summarize Kantor&apos;s work, and then dis-
cuss what we can learn about focus from it.

2.1 Kantor&apos;s thesis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999373931034483">
Kantor&apos;s main exhibit is the following text:
(2-1) A good share of the amazing revival of
commerce must be credited to the ease
and security of communications within the
empire. The Imperial fleet kept the Medi-
terranean Sea cleared of pirates. In each
province, the Roman emperor repaired or
constructed a number of skillfully de-
signed roads. They were built for the
army but served the merchant class as
well. Over them, messengers of the Impe-
rial service, equipped with relays of hors-
es, could average fifty miles a day.
He claims that the they in the penultimate sentence is
hard to comprehend, and that most informants need to
reread the previous text to find its referent. Yet the
sentence is neither semantically anomalous nor ambi-
guous — the roads is the only plural NP available as a
referent, and it occurs immediately before the pronoun
with only a full-stop intervening. To explain this para-
dox is the task Kantor set himself.
Kantor&apos;s explanation is based on discourse topic
and the listener&apos;s expectations. In (2-1), the discourse
topic of the first three sentences is ease and security of
communication in the Roman empire. In the fourth
sentence, there is an improper shift to the roads as the
topic: improper, because it is unexpected, and there is
no discourse cue to signal it. Had the demonstrative
these roads been used, the shift would have been okay.

3 Underlining is used in this and subsequent examples to indi-
cate the anaphor(s) of interest. It does not indicate stress.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910367346939">
(Note that a definite NP such as the roads is not
enough.) Alternatively, the writer could have clarified
the text by combining the last three sentences with
semicolons, indicating that the last two main clauses
were to be construed as relating only to the preceding
one rather than to the discourse as a whole.
Kantor identifies a continuum of factors affecting
the comprehension of pronouns. At one end is unres-
tricted expectation and at the other negative
expectation. What this says in effect is that a pronoun
is easy to understand if its referent is expected, and
difficult if it is unexpected. This is not as vacuous as
it at first sounds; Kantor provides an analysis of some
subtle factors which affect expectation.
The most expected pronominalizations are those
whose referent is the discourse topic, or something
associated with it (though note the qualifications to
this below). Consider:
(2-2) The final years of Henry&apos;s reign, as re-
corded by the admiring Hall, were given
over to sport and gaiety, though there was
little of the licentiousness that character-
ized the French court. The athletic con-
tests were serious but very popular.
Masques, jousts and spectacles followed
one another in endless pageantry. He
brought to Greenwich a tremendously vi-
tal court life, a central importance in the
country&apos;s affairs, and above all, a great
naval connection.4
In the last sentence, he is quite comprehensible, de-
spite the distance back to its referent, because the
discourse topic in all the sentences is Henry&apos;s reign.
An example of the converse — an unexpected pro-
noun which is difficult despite recency — can be seen
in (2-1) above. Between these two extremes are other
cases involving references to aspects of the local topic,
changes in topic, syntactic parallelism, and, in topicless
instances, recency (though the effect of recency de-
cays very fast). I will not describe these here; the
interested reader is referred to Section 2.6.5 of
Kantor&apos;s dissertation (1977).
Kantor then defines the notion of the activatedness
of a concept. This provides a continuum of concept
givenness, which contrasts with the simple binary
given-new distinction usually accepted in linguistics
(for example, Chafe 1970). Kantor also distinguishes
activatedness from the similar &amp;quot;communicative dynam-
ism&amp;quot; of the Prague school (Firbas 1964). Activated-

ness is defined in terms of the comprehensibility phe-
nomena described above: the more activated a concept
is, the easier it is to understand an anaphoric reference
to it. Thus activatedness depends upon discourse top-
ic, context, and so forth.

2.2 The implications of Kantor&apos;s work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971898704545454">
What are the ramifications of Kantor&apos;s thesis for
focus? Clearly, the notions of activatedness and focus
are very similar, though the latter has not generally
been thought of as a continuum. It follows that the
factors Kantor finds relevant for activatedness and
comprehensibility of pronouns are also important for
those of us who would maintain focus in computer-
based natural language understanding (NLU) systems;
we will have to discover discourse topic and topic
shifts, generate pronominalization expectations, and so
forth.
In other words, if we could dynamically compute
(and maintain) the activatedness of each concept
floating around, we would have a measure for the
ordering of the focus set by preferability as referent;
the referent for any given anaphor would be the most
highly activated element which passes basic tests for
number, gender and semantic reasonableness. And to
find the activatedness of the concepts, we follow
Kantor&apos;s pointers (which he himself concedes are very
tenuous and difficult) to extract and identify the rele-
vant factors from the text.
It may be objected that by applying Kantor&apos;s in-
sights all we have done is produce a mere notational
variant of our original problem. This is partly true.
One should not gainsay the power of a good notation,
however, and what we can buy here even with mere
notational variance is the power of Kantor&apos;s investiga-
tions. And there is more. Previously, it has been
suggested that items either are in focus or they aren&apos;t,
and that at each separate anaphor we need to compute
a preference ranking of the focus elements for that
anaphor. What Kantor tells us is that such a ranking
exists independently of the actual use of anaphors in
the text, and that we can find the ranking by looking
at things like discourse topic.
Some miscellaneous comments on Kantor&apos;s work:
1. It can be seen as a generalization albeit a weak-
ening of Grosz&apos;s (1977a, 1977b, 1978) findings on
focus in task-oriented dialogues (where each sub-task
becomes the new discourse topic, opening up a new
set of possible referents), which are discussed below in
Section 3. (Kantor and Grosz were apparently un-
aware of each other&apos;s work; neither cites the other.)
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.919249666666667">
2. It provides an explanation for focus problems
that have previously baffled us. For example, in Hirst
(1977a) I contemplated the problem of the ill-
formedness of this text:
(2-3) *John left the window and drank the wine
on the table. It was brown and round.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999407666666667">
I had previously thought this to be due to a syntactic
factor — that cross-sentence pronominal reference to
an NP in a relative clause or adjectival phrase qualify-
ing an NP was not possible. However, it can also be
explained as a grossly inconsiderate pronoun which
does not refer to the topic properly — the table occurs
only as a descriptor for the wine, and not as a concept
&amp;quot;in its own right&amp;quot;. This would be a major restriction
on possible reference to sub-aspects of topics.

<listItem confidence="0.915283">
3. Like too many other researchers, Kantor makes
many claims about comprehensibility and the degree of
well-formedness of sentences which others (as he con-
cedes) may not agree with. He uses only himself (and
his friends, sometimes) as an informant, and then only
at an intuitive leve1.5 Claims as strong and subtle as
Kantor&apos;s cry out for empirical testing.6
3. Focus of attention in task-oriented dialogues
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999207285714286">
Barbara Grosz (1977a, 1977b, 1978) studied the
maintenance of the focus of attention in task-oriented
dialogues and its effect on the resolution of definite
reference, as part of SRI&apos;s speech understanding sys-
tem project (Walker 1978). By a task-oriented dia-
logue is meant one which has some single major well-
defined task as its goal. For example, Grosz collected
and studied dialogues in which an expert guides an
apprentice in the assembly of an air compressor. She
found that the structure of such dialogues parallels the
structure of the task. That is, just as the major task is
divided into several well-defined sub-tasks, and these
perhaps into sub-sub-tasks and so on, the dialogue is
likewise divided into sub-dialogues, sub-sub-dialogues,
etc,7 each corresponding to a task component, much as
a well-structured Algol program is composed of blocks
within blocks within blocks. As the dialogue progress-
es, each sub-dialogue in turn is performed in a strict
depth-first order corresponding to the order of sub-
task performance in the task goal (though note that
some sub-tasks may not be ordered with respect to

6 Kantor tells me that he hopes to test some of his assertions
by observing the eye movements of readers of considerate and
inconsiderate texts, to find out if inconsiderate texts actually make
readers physically search back for a referent.

others). As we will see, this dialogue structure can be
exploited in reference resolution.
Grosz&apos;s aim was to find ways of determining and
representing the focus of attention of a discourse —
that is, roughly speaking, its global theme and the
things associated therewith — as a means for con-
straining the knowledge an NLU system needs to bring
to bear in understanding discourse. In other words,
the focus of attention is that knowledge which is rele-
vant at a given point in a text for comprehension of
the text.8 Grosz claims that antecedents for definite
reference can be found in the focus of attention. That
is, the focus of attention is a superset of focus in our
sense, the set of referable concepts (in this case defi-
nite reference, not just anaphoric reference). More-
over, no element in the focus of attention is excluded
from being a candidate antecedent for a definite NP.
Grosz thereby implies that all items in the focus of
attention can be referred to, and that hence the two
senses of the word focus are actually identical.
</bodyText>

3.1 Representing and searching focus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996113464285714">
In Grosz&apos;s representation, which uses a partitioned
semantic net formalism (Hendrix 1975, 1978), an
explicit focus corresponds to a sub-dialogue, and in-
cludes, for each concept in it, type information about
that concept and any situation in which that concept
participates. For each item in the explicit focus, there
is an associated implicit focus, which includes subparts
of objects in explicit focus, subevents of events in
explicit focus, and participants in those subevents.
The implicit focus attempts to account for reference to
items that have a close semantic distance to items in
focus, or which have a close enough relationship to
items in focus to be able to be referred to. The im-
plicit focus is also used in detecting focus shifts
(discussed below).
Then, at any given point in a text, antecedents of
definite non-pronominal NPs can be found by search-
ing through the explicit and implicit focus for a match
for the reference. After checking the other non-
pronominal NPs in the same sentence to see if the
reference is intrasentential, the currently active explicit
focus (the focus corresponding to the present sub-
dialogue) is searched, and then if that search is not
successful, the other currently open focus spaces (that
is, those corresponding to sub-dialogues that the pres-
ent sub-dialogue is contained in) are searched in order,
back up to the top of the tree. As part of the search
the implicit focus associated with each explicit focus is
checked, as are subset relations, so that if a novel, say,
8 In her later work (Grosz 1978), Grosz emphasizes focusing as
an active process carried out by dialogue participants.
is in focus, it could be referred to as the book. If there
is still no success after this, one then checks whether
the NP refers to a single unique concept (such as the
sun), contains new information (such as the red coat,
when a coat is in focus, but not yet known to be red),
or refers to an item in implicit focus.
A similar search method could be used for pro-
nouns. However, since pronouns carry much less in-
formation than other definite NPs, more inference is
required by the reference matching process to disam-
biguate many syntactically ambiguous pronouns, and it
would be necessary to search focus exhaustively, com-
paring the reasonableness of candidate referents, rath-
er than stopping at the first plausible one. In addition,
other constraints on pronoun reference, such as local
(rather than global) theme, and default referent, would
also need to be taken into account; Grosz&apos;s mecha-
nisms do not do this. However, Grosz does show how
a partitioned network structure can be used to resolve
certain types of ellipsis by means of syntactic and
semantic pattern matching against the immediately
preceding utterance, which may itself have been ex-
panded from an elliptical expression. She leaves open
for future research most of the problems in relating
pronouns to focus.

3.2 Maintaining focus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999640038461539">
Given this approach, one is then faced with the
problem of deciding what the focus is at a given point
in the discourse. For highly constrained task-oriented
dialogues such as those Grosz considered, the question
of an initial focus does not arise; it is, by definition,
the overall task in question. The other component of
the problem, handling changes and shifts in the focus,
is attacked by Grosz in a top-down manner using the
task structure as a guide.
A shift in focus can be indicated explicitly by an
utterance, such as:
(3-1) Well, the reciprocating afterburner nozzle
speed control is assembled. Next, it must
be fitted above the preburner swivel hose
cover guard cooling fin mounting rack.
In this case, the reciprocating afterburner nozzle speed
control assembly sub-task and its corresponding sub-
dialogue and focus are closed, and new ones are
opened for the reciprocating afterburner nozzle speed
control fitting, dominated by the same open sub-
tasks/sub-dialogues/focuses in their respective trees
that dominated the old ones. If however the new sub-
task were a sub-task of the old one, then the old one
would not be closed, but the new one added to the
hierarchy below it as the new active focus space. The
newly created focus space initially contains only those

items referred to in the utterance, and those objects
associated with the current sub-task. (Being able to
bring in the associated objects at this time is, of
course, the crucial point on which the whole system
relies.) As subsequent non-shift-causing utterances
come in, their new information is added to the active
focus space.
Usually, of course, speakers are not as helpful as in
(3-1), and it is necessary to look for various clues to
shifts in focus. For Grosz, the clues are definite NPs.
If a definite NP from an utterance cannot be matched
in focus, then this is a clue that the focus has shifted,
and it is necessary to search for the new focus. If the
antecedent of a definite NP is in the current implicit
focus, this is a clue that a sub-task associated with this
item is being opened. If the task structure is being
followed, then the new focus will reflect the opening
or closing of a sub-task.
Shifting cannot be done until a whole utterance is
considered, because clues may conflict, or the meaning
of the utterance may contraindicate the posited shift.
In particular, recall that the task structure is only a
guide, and does not define the dialogue structure abso-
lutely. For example, the focus may shift to a problem
associated with the current sub-task with a question
like this:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.586675">
(3-2) Should I use the box-end ratchet wrench
to do that?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907404255319">
This does not imply a shift to the next sub-task requir-
ing a box-end ratchet wrench (assuming that the cur-
rent task doesn&apos;t require one) (cf Grosz 1977b:105).
We can see here that the problem of the circularity
of language comprehension looms dangerously: to
determine the focus one must resolve the references,
and to resolve the references, one must know the fo-
cus. In Grosz&apos;s work, the strong constraints of the
structure of task-oriented dialogues provide a toehold.
Whether generalization to the case of discourse with
other structures, or with no particular structure, is
possible is unclear, as it may not be possible to deter-
mine so nicely what the knowledge associated with any
new focus is. (See however my remarks in Section 2.2
above on the relationship between Grosz&apos;s work and
that of Kantor, and Section 6 on approaches which
attempt to exploit local discourse structure.)
In addition, Grosz&apos;s mechanisms are limited in their
ability to resolve anaphora that require inference or
are intersentential (or both). The assumption that
global focus of attention equals all and only possible
referents (except where the focus shifts), while per-
haps not unreasonable in task-oriented domains, is
probably untrue in general. For example, it is unclear
that such mechanisms could handle the effects of local
as opposed to global theme that exclude the table from
the focus for almost all speakers in (2-3). Similarly,
could the level of world knowledge and inference re-
quired to resolve the different referents of she in (3-3)
and (3-4) be integrated into the partitioned semantic
net formalism?
(3-3) When Nadia visited Sue for dinner,
she ate sukiyaki au gratin.
(3-4) When Nadia visited Sue for dinner,
she served sukiyaki au gratin.
Could entities evoked by, but not explicit in, a text of
only moderate structure be identified and instantiated
in focus? Grosz did not address these issues (nor did
she need to for her immediate goals), but they would
need to be resolved in any attempt to generalize her
approach. (Some other related problems, including
those of focus shifting, are discussed in Grosz 1978.)
Grosz&apos;s contribution was to demonstrate the role of
discourse structure in the identification of theme, rele-
vant world knowledge and the resolution of reference.
We now turn to another system which aspires to simi-
lar goals, but in a more general context.

4. Focus in the PAL system
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998790705882353">
The PAL personal assistant program (Bullwinkle
1977a) is a system designed to accept natural language
requests for scheduling activities. A typical request
(from Bullwinkle 1977b:44) is:
(4-1) I want to schedule a meeting with Ira. It
should be at 3 pm tomorrow. We can
meet in Bruce&apos;s office.
The section of PAL that deals with discourse prag-
matics and reference was developed by Candace Sid-
ner [Bullwinkle] (Bullwinkle 1977b; Sidner 1978a).
Like Grosz&apos;s system, PAL attempts to find a focus of
attention in its knowledge structures to use as a focus
for reference resolution. Sidner sees the focus as
equivalent to the discourse topic; in fact in Bullwinkle
(1977b) the word topic is used instead of focus.
There are three major differences from Grosz&apos;s
system:

<listItem confidence="0.9981476">

structures.

PAL does not use discourse structure to the same ex-
tent, instead relying on more general local cues. How-

4.2 The frame as focus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928424242424">
The representation of knowledge in PAL is based
on frames, and its implementation uses the FRL frame
representation language (actually a dialect of LISP)
developed by Roberts and Goldstein (1977a, 1977b).
In PAL, the frame corresponds to Grosz&apos;s focus
space. Following Rosenberg&apos;s (1976, 1977) work on
discourse structure and frames, the antecedent for a
definite NP is first assumed to be either the frame
itself, or one of its slots. So, for example, in (4-2):
(4-2) I want to have a meeting with RossM. It
should be at three pm. The location will
be the department lounge. Please tell
Ross(2).
it refers to the MEETING frame (not to the text a
meeting) which provides the context for the whole
discourse; the location refers to the LOCATION slot
that the MEETING frame presumably has (thus the
CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH relation (Hirst 1981) is
handled), and Ross(2) to the contents9 of the
CO-MEETER slot, previously given as Ross.
If the antecedent cannot be found in the frame, it
is assumed to be either outside the discourse or infer-
red. In (4-2), PAL would search its database to find
referents for Ross(1) and the department lounge. Per-
sonal names are resolved with a special module that
knows about the semantics of names (Bullwinkle
1977b:48). PAL carries out database searches for
references like the department lounge apparently by
searching a hierarchy of frames, looking at the frames
in the slots of the current focus, and then in the slots
of these frames, and so on (Sidner 1978a:211), though
it is not apparent why this should usefully constrain
the search in the above example.19
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.711931181818182">
9 Sidner only speaks of reference to slots (1978a:211), without
saying whether she means the slot itself or its contents; it seems
reasonable to assume, as I have done here, that she actually means
both.
10 In fact there is no need in this particular example for a
referent at all. The personal assistant need only treat the department
lounge as a piece of text, presumably meaningful to both the speak-
er and Ross, denoting the meeting location. A human might do this
when passing on a message he or she didn&apos;t understand:
(i) Ross asked me to tell you to meet him in
the arboretum, whatever the heck that is.

<bodyText confidence="0.9955948">
On the other hand, an explicit antecedent would be needed if PAL
had been asked, say, to deliver coffee to the meeting in the depart-
ment lounge. Knowing when to be satisfied with ignorance is a
difficult problem which Sidner does not consider, preferring the safe
course of always requiring an antecedent.

4.3 Focus selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998414901960784">
In PAL, the initial focus is the first NP following
the main verb of the first sentence of the discourse —
usually, the object of the sentence — or, if there is no
such NP, then the subject of that sentence. This is a
short-cut method, which seems to be sufficient for
requests to PAL, but which Sidner readily admits is
inadequate for the general case (Sidner 1978a:209). I
will briefly review some of the problems.
Charniak (1978) has shown that the frame-
selection problem (which is here identical to the initial
focus selection problem, since the focus is just the
frame representing the theme of the discourse) is in
fact extremely difficult, and is not in the most general
case amenable to solution by either strictly top-down
or bottom-up methods. Sidner&apos;s assumption that the
relevant frame is given by an explicitly mentioned NP
is also a source of trouble, even in the examples she
quotes, such as these two (Sidner 1978b:92):
(4-3) I was driving along the freeway the other
day. Suddenly the engine began to make
a funny noise.
(4-4) I went to a new restaurant with Sam. The
waitress was nasty. The food was great.
(Underlining indicates what Sidner claims is the fo-
cus.) In (4-3), Sidner posits a chain of inferences to
get from the engine to the focus, the FREEWAY frame.
This is more complex than is necessary; if the
frame/focus were DRIVING (with its LOCATION slot
containing the FREEWAY frame), then the path from
the frame to the engine is shorter and the whole ar-
rangement seems more natural. Thus we see that fo-
cus need not be based on an NP at all.
In (4-4), our problem is what to do with Sam, who
could be referenced in a subsequent sentence. It is
necessary to integrate Sam into the RESTAURANT
frame/focus, since clearly he should not be considered
external to the discourse and sought in the database.
While the RESTAURANT frame may indeed contain a
COMPANION slot for Sam to sit in, it is clear that the
first sentence could have been I went &lt;anywhere at
all&gt; with Sam, requiring that any frame referring to
something occupying a location must have a
COMPANION slot. This is clearly undesirable. But
the RESTAURANT frame is involved in (4-4); other-
wise the waitress and the food would be external to the
discourse. A natural solution is that the frame/focus
of (4-4) is actually the GOING-SOMEWHERE frame
(with Sam in its COMPANION slot), containing the
RESTAURANT frame in its PLACE slot, with both
frames together taken as the focus. Sidner does not
consider mechanisms for a multi-frame focus.

It is, of course, not always true that the
frame/focus is explicit. Charniak (1978) points out
that (4-5) is somehow sufficient to invoke the
MAGICIAN frame:
(4-5) The woman waved as the man on stage
sawed her in half.
(See also Charniak (1981) for more on frame invoca-
tion problems.)
Focus shifting in PAL is restricted: the only shifts
permitted are to and from sub-aspects of the present
focus (Sidner 1978a:209). Old topics are stacked for
possible later return. This is very similar to Grosz&apos;s
open-focus hierarchy. It is unclear whether there is a
predictive aspect to PAL&apos;s focus-shift mechanism,11
but the basic idea seems to be that any new phrase in
a sentence is picked as a potential new focus. If in a
subsequent sentence an anaphoric reference is a se-
mantically acceptable coreferent for that potential
focus, then a shift to that focus is ipso facto indicated
(Sidner 1978a:209). Presumably this check is done
after a check of focus has failed, but before any data-
base search. A potential focus has a limited life span,
and is dropped if not shifted to by the end of the sec-
ond sentence following the one in which it occurred.
An example (Sidner 1978a:209):
(4-6) I want to schedule a meeting with George,
Jim, Steve and Mike. We can meet in my
office. It&apos;s kind of small, but the meeting
won&apos;t last long anyway.
(4-7) I want to schedule a meeting with George,
Jim, Steve and Mike. We can meet in my
office. It won&apos;t take more than 20 min-
utes.
In the second sentence my office is identified as a po-
tential focus, and it, in the first reading of the third
sentence, as an acceptable coreferent to my office
confirms the shift. In the second reading, it couldn&apos;t
be my office, so no shift occurs. The acceptability
decision is based on selectional and case-like restric-
tions.
While perhaps adequate for PAL, this mechanism
is, of course, not sufficient for the general case, where
a true shift, as opposed to an expansion upon a previ-
11 On page 209 of Sidner (1978a) we are told: &amp;quot;Focus shifts
cannot be predicted; they are detectable only after they occur&amp;quot;.
Yet on the following page, Sidner says: &amp;quot;Sentences appearing in
mid-discourse are assumed to be about the focus until the corefer-
ence module predicts a focus shift . . . . Once an implicit focus
relation is established, the module can go onto [sic] predictions of
focus shift&amp;quot;. My interpretation of these remarks is that one cannot
be certain that the next sentence will shift focus, but one can note
when a shift might happen, requiring later checking to confirm or
disconfirm the shift.
ously mentioned point, may occur. This is exemplified
by many of the shifts in Grosz&apos;s task-oriented dia-
logues.
Another problem arising from this shift mechanism
is that two different focus shifts may be indicated at
the same time, but the mechanism has no way to
choose between them. For example:
(4-8) Schedule a meeting of the Experimental
Theology Research Group, and tell Ross
Andrews about it too. I&apos;d like him to
hear about the deocommunication work
that they&apos;re doing.
Each of the two underlined NPs in the first sentence
would be picked as a potential focus. Since each is
pronominally referenced in the second sentence, the
mechanism would be confused as to where to shift the
focus. (Presumably Ross Andrews would be the correct
choice here.)

The shortcomings of Sidner&apos;s work are mainly at-
tributable to two causes: her avoidance of relying on
the highly constrained discourse structures that Grosz
used, and the limited connectivity of frame systems,
compared to Grosz&apos;s semantic nets.12 With respect to
the former point, perhaps Sidner&apos;s main contribution
has been to show the difficulties and pitfalls that lie in
wait for anyone attempting to generalize Grosz&apos;s work,
even to the extent that PAL does.

5. Webber&apos;s formalism
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999683642857143">
In the preceding sections of this paper, we saw
approaches to anaphor resolution that were mainly
top-down in that they relied on a notion of theme
and/or focus of attention to guide the selection of
focus (although theme determination may have been
bottom-up). An alternative approach has been sug-
gested by Bonnie [Nash-]Webber (Nash-Webber and
Reiter 1977; Webber 1978a, 1978b), wherein a set of
rules is applied to a logical-form representation of the
text to derive the set of entities that that text makes
available for subsequent reference. Webber&apos;s formal-
ism attacks some problems caused by quantification
that have not otherwise been considered by workers in
NUL

12 In her thesis (1979) [which was not available to me when
this paper was first written], Sidner subsequently proposed the use
of an association network instead of frames, and presented more
sophisticated focus selection and shifting algorithms. I have empha-
sized her earlier work here, as it has received much wider circula-
tion.

<bodyText confidence="0.996241818181818">
I can only give the flavor of Webber&apos;s formalism
here, and I shall have to assume some familiarity with
logical forms. Readers who want more details should
see her thesis (1978a); readers who find my exposition
mystifying should not worry unduly — the fault is
probably mine — but should turn to the thesis for
illumination.
In Webber&apos;s formalism, it is assumed that an input
sentence is first converted to a parse tree, and then,
by some semantic interpretation process, to an extend-
ed restricted-quantification predicate calculus represen-
tation. It is during this second conversion that ana-
phor resolution takes place. When the final represent-
ation, which we shall simply call a logical form, is com-
plete, certain rules are applied to it to generate the set
of referable entities and descriptions that the sentence
evokes. Webber considers three types of antecedents
— those for definite pronouns, those for
one-anaphora,13 and those for verb phrase ellipsis.
Each type has its own set of rules; we will briefly look
at the first. (The others are discussed in Sections
5.4.2 and 5.4.3 of Hirst 1981.)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998989">
5.1 Definite pronouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999094">
The antecedents for definite pronouns are invoking
descriptions (IDs); these are in effect focus elements
that are explicit in the text. IDs are derived from the
logical form representation of a sentence by a set of
rules that attempt to take into account factors, such as
NP definiteness or references to sets, that affect what
antecedents are evoked by a text. There are six of
these ID-rules:14 which one applies depends on the
structural description of the logical form.
Here is one of Webber&apos;s examples (1978a:64):
(5-1) Wendy bought a crayon.
This has this representation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.440749">
(5-2) (3x:Crayon) . Bought Wendy,x
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.79408">
Now, one of the ID-rules says that any sentence S
whose representation is of this form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.628113">
(5-3) (3x:C) . Fx
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.960789269230769">
where C is an arbitrary predicate on individuals and
Fx an arbitrary open sentence in which x is free,
evokes an entity whose representation is of this form:
13 One-anaphors are those such as those, one, and some uses of it
that refer to a description rather than a specific entity. An exam-
ple:
(i) Wendy didn&apos;t give either boy a green tie-dyed
T-shirt, but she gave Sue a redone.
14 Webber regards her rules only as a preliminary step towards
a complete set that considers all relevant factors. She discusses
some of the remaining problems, such as negation, in Webber
(1978a:81-88).
(5-4) e tx: Cx &amp; Fx &amp; evoke S,X
where e is an arbitrary label assigned to the entity and
t is the definite operator. Hence, starting at the left of
(5-2), we obtain this representation for the crayon of
(5-1):
(5-5) el tx: Crayon x &amp; Bought Wendy,x &amp;
evoke (5-1),x
which may be interpreted as el is the crayon mentioned
in sentence (5-1) that Wendy bought. Similarly we will
obtain a representation of e2, Wendy, which is then
substituted for Wendy in (5-5) after some matching
process has determined the identity of the two.
In this next, more complex example (Webber
1978a:73), we see how quantification is handled:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9145295">
(5-6) Each boy gave each girl a peach.
(Vx:Boy) (Vy:Girl) (3z:Peach) . Gave x,y,z
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.943443942857143">
This matches the following structural description
(where op j stands for the quantifier (Vxj c e), where E../
is an earlier evoked discourse entity, and ! is the left
boundary of a clause):
(5-7) !Q1 . . . Qn (3y:C) . Fy
and hence evokes an ID of this form:
(5-8) 6.1 ty: maxset(X(u:C)[(3x1 E el) . .
(3xn E en) . Fu &amp; evoke S,u1) y
(For any one-place predicate P, maxset(P)y is true if
and only if y is the set of all items u such that Pu
holds.) Another rule has already given us:
(5-9) el tx: maxset(Boy) x
&amp;quot;the set of all boys&amp;quot;
e2 tx: maxset(Girl) x
&amp;quot;the set of all girls&amp;quot;
and so (5-8) is instantiated as:
(5-10) e3 tz: maxset(A(u:Peach) [(3x c el) (3y
E e2) . Gave x,y,u &amp; evoke (5-6),A) z
&amp;quot;the set of peaches, each one of
which is linked to (5-6) by virtue of
some member of el giving it to some
member of e2&amp;quot;
Although such rules could (in principle) be used to
generate all IDs (explicit focus elements) that a sen-
tence evokes, Webber does not commit herself to such
an approach, instead allowing for the possibility of
generating IDs only when they are needed, depending
on subsequent information such as speaker&apos;s perspec-
tive. She also suggests the possibility of &amp;quot;vague, tem-
porary&amp;quot; IDs for interim use (1978a:67).
There is a problem here with intrasentential ana-
phora, since it is assumed that a sentence&apos;s anaphors
are resolved before ID rules are applied to find what
may be the antecedents necessary for that resolution.
Webber proposes that known syntactic and selectional

constraints may help in this conflict, but this is not
always sufficient. For example:
(5-11) Mary bought each girl a cotton T-shirt,
but none of them were the style de rigeur
in high schools.
The IDs for both the set of girls and the set of T-shirts
are needed to resolve them, but them needs to be re-
solved before the IDs are generated. In this particular
example, the clear solution is to work a clause at a
time rather than at a sentence level. However, this is
not always an adequate solution, as (5-12) shows:
(5-12) The rebel students annoyed the teachers
greatly, and by the end of the week none
of the faculty were willing to go to their
classes.
In this ambiguous sentence, one possible antecedent
for their, the faculty, occurs in the same clause as the
anaphor. Thus neither strictly intraclausal nor strictly
interclausal methods are appropriate. Webber is aware
of this problem (1978a:48), and believes that it suffic-
es that such information as is available be used to rule
out impossible choices; the use of vague temporary
IDs then allows the anaphor to be resolved.

5.2 Conclusions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997332888888889">
It remains to discuss the strengths and weaknesses
of Webber&apos;s approach, and she herself (in contradis-
tinction to some other workers) is as quick to point
out the latter as the former. The reader is therefore
referred to her thesis (1978a) for this. However, I
will make some global comments on the important
aspects relevant here.
Webber&apos;s main contributions, as I see them, are as
follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988343578947368">
1. The anaphor resolution problem is ap-
proached from the point of view of deter-
mining what an adequate representation
would be, rather than trying to fit (to
straitjacket?) a resolution mechanism into
some pre-existing and perhaps arbitrarily
chosen representation; and the criteria of
adequacy for the representation are rigor-
ously enumerated.
2. A formalism in which it is possible to
compute focus elements as they are need-
ed, rather than having them sitting round
in advance (as in Grosz&apos;s system), per-
haps never to be used, is provided (but
compare my further remarks below).
3. Webber brings to NLU anaphora research
the formality and rigor of logic, something
that has been previously almost unseen.
4. Previously ignored problems of quantifica-

<bodyText confidence="0.70548425">
tion are dealt with.
5. The formalism itself is an important con-
tribution.
The shortcomings, as I see them, are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.936843090909091">
1. The formalism relies very much on ante-
cedents being in the text. Entities evoked
by, but not explicit in, the text cannot in
general be adequately handled (in con-
trast to Grosz&apos;s system).
2. The formalism is not related to discourse
structure. So, for example, it contains
nothing to discourage the use of the table
as the antecedent in (2-3). It remains to
be seen if discourse pragmatics can be
adequately integrated with the formalism
or otherwise accounted for in a system
using the formalism.
3. Intrasentential and intraclausal anaphora
are not adequately dealt with.
4. Webber does not relate her discussions of
representational adequacy to currently
popular knowledge representations. If
frames, for example, are truly inadequate
we would like to have some watertight
proof of this before abandoning current
NLU projects attempting to use frames.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997293">
It will be noticed that contribution 2 and shortcoming
1 are actually two sides of the same coin — it is static
pre-available knowledge that allows non-textual enti-
ties to be easily found — and clearly a synthesis will
be necessary here.

6. Discourse-cohesion approaches to anaphora
resolution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888">
Another approach to coreference resolution at-
tempts to exploit local discourse cohesion, building a
representation of the discourse with which references
can be resolved. This approach has been taken by
(inter alia) Klappholz and Lockman (1977; Lockman
1978). By using only cues to the discourse structure
at the sentence level or lower, one avoids the need to
search for referents in pre-determined dialogue models
such as those of Grosz&apos;s task-oriented dialogues, or
rigidly predefined knowledge structures such as scripts
(Schank and Abelson 1977) and frames (Minsky
1975), which Klappholz and Lockman, for example,
call overweight structures that inflexibly dominate
processing of text. Klappholz and Lockman empha-
size that the structure through which reference is re-
solved must be dynamically built up as the text is
processed; frames or scripts could assist in this build-
ing, but cannot, however, be reliably used for refer-

ence resolution, because deviations by the text from
the pre-defined structure will cause errors.
The basis of this approach is that there is a strong
interrelationship between coreference and the cohesive
ties in a discourse that make it coherent. By determin-
ing what the cohesive ties in a discourse are, one can
put each new sentence or clause, as it comes in, into
the appropriate place in a growing structure that repre-
sents the discourse. This structure can then be used as
a focus to search for coreference antecedents, since
not only do coherently connected sentences tend to
refer to the same things, but knowledge of the cohe-
sion relation can provide additional reference resolu-
tion restraints. Hobbs (1979) in particular sees the
problem of coreference resolution as being automati-
cally solved in the process of discovering the coher-
ence relations in a text. (An example of this will be
given in Section 6.2.) Conversely, it is frequently help-
ful or necessary to resolve coreference relations in
order to discover the coherence relations. This is not
a vicious circle, claims Hobbs, but a spiral staircase.
In our discussion below, we will cover four issues:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997529833333333">
1. deciding on a set of possible coherence
relations;
2. detecting them when they occur in a text;
3. using the coherence relations to build a
focus structure; and
4. searching for referents in the structure.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999934">
6.1 Coherence relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987224125">
The first thing required by this approach is a com-
plete and computable set of the coherence relations
that may obtain between sentences and/or clauses.
Various sets have been suggested by many people,
including Eisenstadt (1976), Phillips (1977), Pitkin
(1977a, 1977b), Hirst (1977b, 1978), Lockman
(1978), Hobbs (1978, 1979) and Reichman (1978).15
None of these sets fulfill all desiderata; and while Hal-
liday and Hasan (1976) provide an extensive analysis
of cohesion, it does not fit within our computational
framework of coherence relations, and those, such as
Hobbs, Lockman, Eisenstadt and Hirst, who empha-
size computability, provide sets insufficient, I believe,
to capture all the semantic subtleties of discourse co-
hesion. Nevertheless, the works cited above undoub-
tedly serve as a useful starting point for development
of this area.
15 Reichman&apos;s coherence relations operate at paragraph level
rather than sentence or clause level.
To illustrate what a very preliminary set of cohe-
sion relations could look like, I will briefly present a
set abstracted from the various sets of Eisenstadt,
Hirst, Hobbs, Lockman and Phillips (but not faithful
to any one of these).
The set contains two basic classes of coherence
relations: expansion or elaboration on an entity, con-
cept or event in the discourse, and temporal continua-
tion or time flow. Expansion includes relations like
EFFECT, CAUSE, SYLLOGISM, ELABORATION,
CONTRAST, PARALLEL and EXEMPLIFICATION. In
the following examples, &amp;quot; • &amp;quot; is used to indicate the
point where the cohesive tie illustrated is acting:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.80683">

the relations above; the boundaries between categories
are yet ill-defined, and it is to be expected that some
people&apos;s intuitions will differ from mine )

forwards or backwards over time:

Temporal flow may be treated as a single relation,
as Phillips, for example, does, or it may be subdivided,
as by Eisenstadt and Hirst, into categories like TIME
STEP, FLASHBACK, FLASHFORWARD, TIME EDIT,
and so on. Certainly, time flow in a text may be quite
contorted, as in (6-10) (from Hirst 1978); &apos;u&amp;quot; indi-
cates a point where the direction of the time flow
changes:

It is not clear, however, to what extent an analysis of
time flow is necessary for anaphor resolution. I sus-
pect that relatively little is necessary — less than is
required for other aspects of discourse understanding.
I see relations like those exemplified above as
primitives from which more complex relations could be
built. For example, the relation between the two sen-
tences of (6-3) above clearly involves FORWARD
TIME STEP as well as EFFECT. I have hypothesized
elsewhere (Hirst 1978) the possibility of constructing
a small set of discourse relations (with cardinality
about twenty or less) from which more complex rela-
tions may be built up by simple combination, and, one
hopes, in such a way that the effects of relation

What would the formal definition of a coherence
relation be like? Here is Hobbs&apos;s (1979:73) definition
of ELABORATION: Sentence S1 is an ELABORATION
of sentence So if some proposition P follows from the
assertions of both So and S1, but S1 contains a prop-
erty of one of the elements of P that is not in So. The
example in the next section will clarify this.

6.2 An example of anaphor resolution using a
coherence relation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9818111875">
It is appropriate at this stage to give an example of
the use of coherence relations in the resolution of
anaphors. I will present an outline of one of Hobbs&apos;s;
for the fine details I have omitted, see Hobbs
(1979:78-80). The text is this:
(6-11) John can open Bill&apos;s safe. He knows the
combination.
We want an NLU system to recognize the cohesion
relation operating here, namely ELABORATION, and
identify he as John and the combination as that of Bill&apos;s
safe. We assume that in the world knowledge that the
system has are various axioms and rules of inference
dealing with such matters as what combinations of
safes are and knowledge about doing things. Then,
from the first sentence of (6-11), which we represent
as (6-12):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.702765">
(6-12) can (John, open (Bill&apos;s-safe))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985659545454546">
(we omit the details of the representation of Bill&apos;s
safe), we can infer:
(6-13) know (John, cause (do (John, a),
open (Bill&apos;s-safe)))
&amp;quot;John knows that he can perform an ac-
tion a that will cause Bill&apos;s-safe to be
open&amp;quot;
From the second sentence of (6-11), namely:
(6-14) know (he, combination (comb, y))
&amp;quot;someone, he, knows the combination
comb to something, y&amp;quot;
we can infer, using knowledge about combinations:
(6-15) know (he, cause (dial (comb,y), open (y)))
&amp;quot;he knows that by causing the dialing of
comb on y, the state in which y is open
will be brought about&amp;quot;
Recognizing that (6-13) and (6-15) are nearly identi-
cal, and assuming that some coherence relation does
hold, we can identify he with John, y with Bill&apos;s-safe,
and the definition of the ELABORATION relation is
satisfied. In the process, the required referents were
found.

6.3 Lockman&apos;s contextual reference resolution
algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987942307693">
Given a set of discourse cohesion relations, how
may their use in a text be computationally recognized
and employed to build a structure that represents the
discourse and can be used as a focus for reference
resolution? Only Hobbs (1978, 1979) and Lockman
(1978; Klappholz and Lockman 1977) seem to have
considered these aspects of the problem, though Eisen-
stadt (1976) discusses some of the requirements in
world knowledge and inference that would be re-
quired. In this section we look at Lockman&apos;s work.
Lockman does not separate the three processes of
recognizing cohesion, resolving references and building
the representation of the discourse. Rather, as befits
such interrelated processes, all three are carried out at
the same time. His contextual reference resolution
algorithm (CRRA) works as follows:
The structure to be built is a tree, initially null, of
which each node is a sentence and each edge a coher-
ence relation. As each new sentence comes in, the
CRRA tries to find the right node of the tree to attach
it to, starting at the leaf that is the previous sentence
and working back up the tree in a specified search
order (discussed below) until a connection is indicated.
Lockman assumes the existence of a judgment mecha-
nism that generates and tests hypotheses as to how the
new sentence may be feasibly connected to the node
being tested. The first hypothesis whose likelihood
exceeds a certain threshold is chosen.
The hypotheses consider both the coherence and
the coreference relations that may obtain. Each mem-
ber of the set of coherence relations is hypothesized,
and for each one, all possible coreference relations
between the conceptual tokens of the new sentence
and tokens in the node under consideration (or nearby
it in the tree) are posited. (The search for tokens goes
back as far as necessary in the tree until suitable to-
kens are found for all unfulfilled definite noun phras-
es.) The hypotheses are considered in parallel; if none
are judged sufficiently likely, the next node or set of
nodes will be considered for feasible connection to the
current sentence.
The search order is as follows: First the immediate
context, the previous sentence, is tried. If no feasible
connection is found, then the immediate ancestor of
this node, and all its other descendants, are tried in
parallel. If the algorithm is still unsuccessful, the im-
mediate ancestor of the immediate ancestor, and the
descendants thereof, are tried, and so on up the tree.
If a test of several nodes in parallel yields more than
one acceptable node, the one nearest the immediate
context is chosen.
If the current sentence is not a simple sentence, it
is not broken into clauses dealt with individually, but
rather converted to a small sub-tree, reflecting the
semantic relationship between the clauses. The con-
version is based simply upon a table look-up indexed
on the structure of the parse tree of the sentence.
One of the nodes is designated by the table look-up as
the head node, and the sub-tree is attached to the
pre-existing context tree, using the procedure de-
scribed above, with the connection occurring at this
node. Similarly one (or more) of the nodes is desig-
nated as the immediate context, the starting point for
the next search. (The search will be conducted in
parallel if there is more than one immediate context
node.)
There are some possible problems with Lockman&apos;s
approach. The first lies in the fact that the structure
built grows without limit, and therefore a search in it
could, in theory, run right through an enormous tree.
Normally, of course, a feasible connection or desired
referent will be found fairly quickly, close to the im-
mediate context. However, should the judgment
mechanism fail to spot the correct one, the algorithm
may run a little wild, searching large areas of the
structure needlessly and expensively, possibly lighting
on a wrong referent or wrong node for attachment,
with no indication that an error has occurred. In other
words, Lockman&apos;s CRRA places much greater trust in
the judgment mechanism than a system like Grosz&apos;s
that constrains the referent search area — more trust
than perhaps should be put in what will necessarily be
the most tentative and unreliable part of the system.
Secondly, I am worried about the syntax-based
table look-up for sub-trees for complex sentences. On
the one hand, it would be nice if it were correct, sim-
plifying processing. On the other hand, I cannot but
feel that it is an over-simplification, and that effects of
discourse theme cannot reliably be handled in this
way. However, I have no counterexamples to give,
and suggest that this question needs more investiga-
tion.
The third possible problem, and perhaps the most
serious, concerns the order in which the search for a
feasible connection takes place. Because the first
hypothesis whose likelihood exceeds the threshold is
selected, it is possible to miss an even better hypothe-
sis further up the tree. In theory, this could be avoid-
ed by doing all tests in parallel, the winning hypothesis
being judged on both likelihood and closeness to the
immediate context. In practice, given the ever-
growing context tree as discussed above, this would
not be feasible, and some way to limit the search area
would be needed.

<bodyText confidence="0.999918333333333">
The fourth problem lies in the judgment mechanism
itself. Lockman frankly admits that the mechanism,
incorporated as a black box in his algorithm, must
have abilities far beyond those of present state-of-the-
art inference and judgment systems. The problem is
that it is unwise to predicate too much on the nature
of this unbuilt black box, as we do not know yet if its
input-output behavior could be as Lockman posits. It
may well be that to perform as required, the mecha-
nism will need access to information such as the sen-
tence following the current one (in effect, the ability
to delay a decision), or more information about the
previous context than the CRRA retains or ever deter-
mines; in fact, it may need an entirely different dis-
course structure representation from the tree being
built. In other words, while it is fine in theory to de-
sign a reference resolver around a black box, in prac-
tice it may be computationally more economical to
design the reference resolver around a knowledge of
how the black box actually works, exploiting that
mechanism, rather than straitjacketing the judgment
module into its pre-defined cabinet; thus Lockman&apos;s
work may be premature.
None of these problems are insurmountable. How-
ever it is perhaps a little unfortunate that Lockman&apos;s
work offers little of immediate use for NLU systems of
the present day.

Clearly, much work remains to be done if the
coherence/cohesion paradigm of NLU is to be viable.
Almost all aspects need refinement. However, it is an
intuitively appealing paradigm, and it will be interest-
ing to see if it can be developed into functioning NLU
systems.

Each approach examined offers a different insight
into some aspect or aspects of the use of discourse
structure to resolve anaphora. So far there has been
no attempt to integrate these insights into a single
cohesive system or model; indeed this will be an ex-
tremely difficult task. It should, however, be a most
fruitful one, and is the logical next step in computa-
tional anaphora resolution.

If the antecedent cannot be found in the frame, it is assumed to be either outside the discourse or inferred. In (4-2), PAL would search its database to find referents for Ross(1) and the department lounge. Personal names are resolved with a special module that knows about the semantics of names (Bullwinkle 1977b:48). PAL carries out database searches for references like the department lounge apparently by searching a hierarchy of frames, looking at the frames in the slots of the current focus, and then in the slots of these frames, and so on (Sidner 1978a:211), though it is not apparent why this should usefully constrain the search in the above example.19 9 Sidner only speaks of reference to slots (1978a:211), without saying whether she means the slot itself or its contents; it seems reasonable to assume, as I have done here, that she actually means both. 10 In fact there is no need in this particul</context>

Knowing when to be satisfied with ignorance is a difficult problem which Sidner does not consider, preferring the safe course of always requiring an antecedent. 4.3 Focus selection In PAL, the initial focus is the first NP following the main verb of the first sentence of the discourse — usually, the object of the sentence — or, if there is no such NP, then the subject of that sentence. This is a short-cut method, which seems to be sufficient for requests to PAL, but which Sidner readily admits is inadequate for the general case (Sidner 1978a:209). I will briefly review some of the problems. Charniak (1978) has shown that the frameselection problem (which is here identical to the initial focus selection problem, since the focus is just the frame representing the theme of the discourse) is in fact extremely difficult, and is not in the most general case amenable to solution by either strictly top-down or bottom-up methods. Sidner&apos;s assumption that the relevant frame is given by an explicitly mentioned NP is also a source of trouble, even in the examples she quotes, such as these two (Sidner 1978b:92): (4-3) I was driving along the freeway the other day.

A natural solution is that the frame/focus of (4-4) is actually the GOING-SOMEWHERE frame (with Sam in its COMPANION slot), containing the RESTAURANT frame in its PLACE slot, with both frames together taken as the focus. Sidner does not consider mechanisms for a multi-frame focus. 90 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 2, April-June 1981 Graeme Hirst Discourse-Oriented Anaphora Resolution It is, of course, not always true that the frame/focus is explicit.

In our discussion below, we will cover four issues: 1. deciding on a set of possible coherence relations; 2. detecting them when they occur in a text; 3. using the coherence relations to build a focus structure; and 4. searching for referents in the structure. 6.1 Coherence relations The first thing required by this approach is a complete and computable set of the coherence relations that may obtain between sentences and/or clauses. Various sets have been suggested by many people, including Eisenstadt (1976), Phillips (1977), Pitkin (1977a, 1977b), Hirst (1977b, 1978), Lockman (1978), Hobbs (1978, 1979) and Reichman (1978).15 None of these sets fulfill all desiderata; and while Halliday and Hasan (1976) provide an extensive analysis of cohesion, it does not fit within our computational framework of coherence relations, and those, such as Hobbs, Lockman, Eisenstadt and Hirst, who emphasize computability, provide sets insufficient, I believe, to capture all the semantic subtleties of discourse cohesion.

Only Hobbs (1978, 1979) and Lockman (1978; Klappholz and Lockman 1977) seem to have considered these aspects of the problem, though Eisenstadt (1976) discusses some of the requirements in world knowledge and inference that would be required. In this section we look at Lockman&apos;s work. Lockman does not separate the three processes of recognizing cohesion, resolving references and building the representation of the discourse. Rather, as befits such interrelated processes, all three are carried out at the same time. His contextual reference resolution algorithm (CRRA) works as follows: The structure to be built is a tree, initially null, of which each node is a sentence and each edge a coherence relation.

That is, the focus of attention is a superset of focus in our sense, the set of referable concepts (in this case definite reference, not just anaphoric reference). Moreover, no element in the focus of attention is excluded from being a candidate antecedent for a definite NP. Grosz thereby implies that all items in the focus of attention can be referred to, and that hence the two senses of the word focus are actually identical. 3.1 Representing and searching focus In Grosz&apos;s representation, which uses a partitioned semantic net formalism (Hendrix 1975, 1978), an explicit focus corresponds to a sub-dialogue, and includes, for each concept in it, type information about that concept and any situation in which that concept participates. For each item in the explicit focus, there is an associated implicit focus, which includes subparts of objects in explicit focus, subevents of events in explicit focus, and participants in those subevents. The implicit focus attempts to account for reference to items that have a close semantic distance to items in focus, or which have a close enough relationship to items in focus to be able to be referred to.

Five approaches, all within this paradigm and yet all distinctly different, are presented, and their strengths and weaknesses evaluated. 1. Introduction To resolve various forms of definite reference — anaphora in particular — early natural language understanding systems (reviewed in Hirst 1981) typically used a simple kind of history list of concepts previously mentioned in the input, with heuristics for selecting from this list. The history list was usually just a shift register containing the noun phrases from the last sentence or two, and the heuristics would take into account (among other things) selectional restrictions and syntactic constraints on pronominalization. SHRDLU (Winograd 1972) exemplifies this approach. Although able to resolve some types of reference, these systems were not able to handle reference in general, primarily because they did not take into account the e</context>

Some preliminary definitions: By focus we mean the set containing exactly those concepts available for anaphoric or other definite reference at a point in a text, a set which may conveniently be divided into parts for nominal concepts, temporal concepts, verbal concepts and so forth.2 The focus is closely related to, but not necessarily identical to, the theme of a discourse — what the discourse is about — and since the latter is also sometimes termed focus, there is some terminological confusion. (See Section 2.6 and Chapter 4 of Hirst 1981 for further discussion of the distinction between theme and focus.) Strictly speaking, we mean by the referent of an anaphor or reference the real-world entity that it specifies, while by antecedent we mean the textual item through which the reference is made.

Following Rosenberg&apos;s (1976, 1977) work on discourse structure and frames, the antecedent for a definite NP is first assumed to be either the frame itself, or one of its slots. So, for example, in (4-2): (4-2) I want to have a meeting with RossM. It should be at three pm. The location will be the department lounge. Please tell Ross(2). it refers to the MEETING frame (not to the text a meeting) which provides the context for the whole discourse; the location refers to the LOCATION slot that the MEETING frame presumably has (thus the CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH relation (Hirst 1981) is handled), and Ross(2) to the contents9 of the CO-MEETER slot, previously given as Ross. If the antecedent cannot be found in the frame, it is assumed to be either outside the discourse or inferred. In (4-2), PAL would search its database to find referents for Ross(1) and the department lounge. Personal names are resolved with a special module that knows about the semantics of names (Bullwinkle 1977b:48). PAL carries out database searches for references like the department lounge apparently by searching a hierarchy of frames, looking at the frames in the slots of the current focus, and then</context>

It is during this second conversion that anaphor resolution takes place. When the final representation, which we shall simply call a logical form, is complete, certain rules are applied to it to generate the set of referable entities and descriptions that the sentence evokes. Webber considers three types of antecedents — those for definite pronouns, those for one-anaphora,13 and those for verb phrase ellipsis. Each type has its own set of rules; we will briefly look at the first. (The others are discussed in Sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 of Hirst 1981.) 5.1 Definite pronouns The antecedents for definite pronouns are invoking descriptions (IDs); these are in effect focus elements that are explicit in the text. IDs are derived from the logical form representation of a sentence by a set of rules that attempt to take into account factors, such as NP definiteness or references to sets, that affect what antecedents are evoked by a text. There are six of these ID-rules:14 which one applies depends on the structural description of the logical form. Here is one of Webber&apos;s examples (1978a:64): (5-1) Wendy bought a crayon.

Only Hobbs (1978, 1979) and Lockman (1978; Klappholz and Lockman 1977) seem to have considered these aspects of the problem, though Eisenstadt (1976) discusses some of the requirements in world knowledge and inference that would be required. In this section we look at Lockman&apos;s work. Lockman does not separate the three processes of recognizing cohesion, resolving references and building the representation of the discourse. Rather, as befits such interrelated processes, all three are carried out at the same time. His contextual reference resolution algorithm (CRRA) works as follows: The structure to be built i</context>

By determining what the cohesive ties in a discourse are, one can put each new sentence or clause, as it comes in, into the appropriate place in a growing structure that represents the discourse. This structure can then be used as a focus to search for coreference antecedents, since not only do coherently connected sentences tend to refer to the same things, but knowledge of the cohesion relation can provide additional reference resolution restraints. Hobbs (1979) in particular sees the problem of coreference resolution as being automatically solved in the process of discovering the coherence relations in a text. (An example of this will be given in Section 6.2.) Conversely, it is frequently helpful or necessary to resolve coreference relations in order to discover the coherence relations. This is not a vicious circle, claims Hobbs, but a spiral staircase.

The example in the next section will clarify this. 6.2 An example of anaphor resolution using a coherence relation It is appropriate at this stage to give an example of the use of coherence relations in the resolution of anaphors. I will present an outline of one of Hobbs&apos;s; for the fine details I have omitted, see Hobbs (1979:78-80). The text is this: (6-11) John can open Bill&apos;s safe. He knows the combination. We want an NLU system to recognize the cohesion relation operating here, namely ELABORATION, and identify he as John and the combination as that of Bill&apos;s safe. We assume that in the world knowledge that the system has are various axioms and rules of inference dealing with such matters as what combinations of safes are and knowledge about doing things.

Generally, however, the two words can be (and are) used interchangeably without confusion. 2. Concept activatedness Robert Kantor (1977) has investigated the problem of why some pronouns in discourse are more comprehensible than others, even when there is no ambiguity or anomaly. In Kantor&apos;s terms, a hard-to-understand pronoun is an example of inconsiderate discourse, and speakers (or, more usually, writers) who produce such pronouns lack secondary [linguistic] competence. In our terms, an inconsiderate pronoun is one that is not properly in focus. I will first summarize Kantor&apos;s work, and then discuss what we can learn about focus from it. 2.1 Kantor&apos;s thesis Kantor&apos;s main exhibit is the following text: (2-1) A good share of </context>

Kantor then defines the notion of the activatedness of a concept. This provides a continuum of concept givenness, which contrasts with the simple binary given-new distinction usually accepted in linguistics (for example, Chafe 1970). Kantor also distinguishes activatedness from the similar &amp;quot;communicative dynamism&amp;quot; of the Prague school (Firbas 1964). Activated4 From: Hamilton, Olive and Hamilton, Nigel.

It will be noticed that contribution 2 and shortcoming 1 are actually two sides of the same coin — it is static pre-available knowledge that allows non-textual entities to be easily found — and clearly a synthesis will be necessary here. 6. Discourse-cohesion approaches to anaphora resolution Another approach to coreference resolution attempts to exploit local discourse cohesion, building a representation of the discourse with which references can be resolved.

Webber&apos;s formalism In the preceding sections of this paper, we saw approaches to anaphor resolution that were mainly top-down in that they relied on a notion of theme and/or focus of attention to guide the selection of focus (although theme determination may have been bottom-up). An alternative approach has been suggested by Bonnie [Nash-]Webber (Nash-Webber and Reiter 1977; Webber 1978a, 1978b), wherein a set of rules is applied to a logical-form representation of the text to derive the set of entities that that text makes available for subsequent reference. Webber&apos;s formalism attacks some problems caused by quantification that have not otherwise been considered by workers in NUL 12 In her thesis (1979) [which was not available to me when this paper was first written], Sidner subsequently proposed the use of an association network instead of frames, and presented more sophisticated focus selection and shifting algorithms.

We now turn to another system which aspires to similar goals, but in a more general context. 4. Focus in the PAL system The PAL personal assistant program (Bullwinkle 1977a) is a system designed to accept natural language requests for scheduling activities. A typical request (from Bullwinkle 1977b:44) is: (4-1) I want to schedule a meeting with Ira. It should be at 3 pm tomorrow. We can meet in Bruce&apos;s office. The section of PAL that deals with discourse pragmatics and reference was developed by Candace Sidner [Bullwinkle] (Bullwinkle 1977b; Sidner 1978a). Like Grosz&apos;s system, PAL attempts to find a focus of attention in its knowledge structures to use as a focus for reference resolution. Sidner sees the focus as equivalent to the discourse topic; in fact in Bullwinkle (1977b) the word topic is used instead of focus. There are three major differences from Grosz&apos;s system: 1.

We now turn to another system which aspires to similar goals, but in a more general context. 4. Focus in the PAL system The PAL personal assistant program (Bullwinkle 1977a) is a system designed to accept natural language requests for scheduling activities. A typical request (from Bullwinkle 1977b:44) is: (4-1) I want to schedule a meeting with Ira. It should be at 3 pm tomorrow. We can meet in Bruce&apos;s office. The section of PAL that deals with discourse pragmatics and reference was developed by Candace Sidner [Bullwinkle] (Bullwinkle 1977b; Sidner 1978a). Like Grosz&apos;s system, PAL attempts to find a focus of attention in its knowledge structures to use as a focus for reference resolution. Sidner sees the focus as equivalent to the discourse topic; in fact in Bullwinkle (1977b) the word topic is used instead of focus. There are three major differences from Grosz&apos;s system: 1. PAL does not rely heavily on discourse structures. 2. Knowledge is represented in frames. 3. Focus selection and shifting are handled at a more superficial level. I will discuss each difference in turn. 4.1 PAL&apos;s approach to discourse Because a request to PAL need not hav</context>

In our discussion below, we will cover four issues: 1. deciding on a set of possible coherence relations; 2. detecting them when they occur in a text; 3. using the coherence relations to build a focus structure; and 4. searching for referents in the structure. 6.1 Coherence relations The first thing required by this approach is a complete and computable set of the coherence relations that may obtain between sentences and/or clauses. Various sets have been suggested by many people, including Eisenstadt (1976), Phillips (1977), Pitkin (1977a, 1977b), Hirst (1977b, 1978), Lockman (1978), Hobbs (1978, 1979) and Reichman (1978).15 None of these sets fulfill all desiderata; and while Halliday and Hasan (1976) provide an extensive analysis of cohesion, it does not fit within our computational framework of coherence relations, and those, such as Hobbs, Lockman, Eisenstadt and Hirst, who emphasize computability, provide sets insufficient, I believe, to capture all the semantic subtleties of discourse cohesion. Nevertheless, the works cited above undoubtedly serve as a useful starting point for development of this area. 15 Reichman&apos;s coherence relations operate at paragraph level r</context>

Only Hobbs (1978, 1979) and Lockman (1978; Klappholz and Lockman 1977) seem to have considered these aspects of the problem, though Eisenstadt (1976) discusses some of the requirements in world knowledge and inference that would be required. In this section we look at Lockman&apos;s work. Lockman does not separate the three processes of recognizing cohesion, resolving references and building the representation of the discourse. Rather, as befits such interrelated processes, all three are carried out at the same time.

Introduction To resolve various forms of definite reference — anaphora in particular — early natural language understanding systems (reviewed in Hirst 1981) typically used a simple kind of history list of concepts previously mentioned in the input, with heuristics for selecting from this list. The history list was usually just a shift register containing the noun phrases from the last sentence or two, and the heuristics would take into account (among other things) selectional restrictions and syntactic constraints on pronominalization. SHRDLU (Winograd 1972) exemplifies this approach. Although able to resolve some types of reference, these systems were not able to handle reference in general, primarily because they did not take into account the effects of discourse structure on reference and pronominalization. This failure motivated work in computational discourse understanding that attempted to exploit discourse structure, especially the relationship between reference and discourse theme, to resolve definite reference. The present paper&apos; is a review of recent work in this area. Five principal approaches are surveyed: 1. Concept activatedness (Ka</context>
