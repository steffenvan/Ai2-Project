We present an implemented system for processing definite descriptions in arbitrary domains.
The design of the system is based on the results of a corpus analysis previously reported, which
highlighted the prevalence of discourse-new descriptions in newspaper corpora. The annotated
corpus was used to extensively evaluate the proposed techniques for matching definite descriptions
with their antecedents, discourse segmentation, recognizing discourse-new descriptions, and
suggesting anchors for bridging descriptions.

Most models of definite description processing proposed in the literature tend to
emphasise the anaphoric role of these elements.&apos; (Heim j19821 is perhaps the best for-
malization of this type of theory). This approach is challenged by the results of exper-
iments we reported previously (Poesio and Vieira 1998), in which subjects were asked
to classify the uses of definite descriptions in Wall Street Journal articles according
to schemes derived from proposals by Hawkins (1978) and Prince (1981). The results
of these experiments indicated that definite descriptions are not primarily anaphoric;
about half of the time they are used to introduce a new entity in the discourse. In
this paper, we present an implemented system for processing definite descriptions
based on the results of that earlier study. In our system, techniques for recognizing
discourse-new descriptions play a role as important as techniques for identifying the
antecedent of anaphoric ones.
A central characteristic of the work described here is that we intended from the
start to develop a system whose performance could be evaluated using the texts an-
notated in the experiments mentioned above. Assessing the performance of an NLP
system on a large number of examples is increasingly seen as a much more thorough
evaluation of its performance than trying to come up with counterexamples; it is con-
sidered essential for language engineering applications. These advantages are thought
by many to offset some of the obvious disadvantages of this way of developing NLP
theories—in particular, the fact that, given the current state of language processing
technology, many hypotheses of interest cannot be tested yet (see below). As a result,
quantitative evaluation is now commonplace in areas of language engineering such
as parsing, and quantitative evaluation techniques are being proposed for semantic

interpretation as well, for example, at the Sixth and Seventh Message Understand-
ing Conferences (MUC-6 and MUC-7) (Sundheirn 1995; Chinchor 1997), which also
included evaluations of systems on the so-called coreference task, a subtask of which
is the resolution of definite descriptions. The system we present was developed to be
evaluated in a quantitative fashion, as well, but because of the problems concerning
agreement between annotators observed in our previous study, we evaluated the sys-
tem both by measuring precision/recall against a &amp;quot;gold standard,&amp;quot; as done in MUC,
and by measuring agreement between the annotations produced by the system and
those proposed by the annotators.
The decision to develop a system that could be quantitatively evaluated on a large
number of examples resulted in an important constraint: we could not make use of
inference mechanisms such as those assumed by traditional computational theories
of definite description resolution (e.g., Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Alshawi 1990; Poesio
1993). Too many facts and axioms would have to be encoded by hand for theories
of this type to be tested even on a medium-sized corpus. Our system, therefore, is
based on a shallow-processing approach more radical even than that attempted by
the first advocate of this approach, Carter (1987), or by the systems that participated
in the MUC evaluations (Appelt et al. 1995; Gaizaukas et al. 1995; Humphreys et al.
1988), since we made no attempt to fine-tune the system to maximize performance
on a particular domain. The system relies only on structural information, on the in-
formation provided by preexisting lexical sources such as WordNet (Fellbatun 1998),
on minimal amounts of general hand-coded information, or on information that could
be acquired automatically from a corpus. As a result, the system does not really have
the resources to correctly resolve those definite descriptions whose interpretation does
require complex reasoning (we grouped these in what we call the &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot; class).
We nevertheless developed heuristic techniques for processing these types of definites
as well, the idea being that these heuristics may provide a baseline against which the
gains in performance due to the use of commonsense knowledge can be assessed more
clearly.2
The paper is organized as follows: We first summarize the results of our previous
corpus study (Poesio and Vieira 1998) (Section 2) and then discuss the model of defi-
nite description processing that we adopted as a result of that work and the general
architecture of the system (Section 3). In Section 4 we discuss the heuristics that we
developed for resolving anaphoric definite descriptions, recognizing discourse-new
descriptions, and processing bridging descriptions, and, in Section 5, how the per-
formance of these heuristics was evaluated using the annotated corpus. Finally, we
present the final configuration of the two versions of the system that we developed
(Section 6), review other systems that perform similar tasks (Section 7), and present
our conclusions and indicate future work (Section 8).

As mentioned above, the architecture of our system is motivated by the results con-
cerning definite description use in our corpus, discussed in Poesio and Vieira (1998).
In this section we briefly review the results presented in that paper.
2 in fact, it is precisely because we are interested in identifying the types of commonsense reasoning
actually used in language processing that we focused on definite descriptions rather than on other
types of anaphoric expressions (such as pronouns and ellipsis) that can be processed much more
effectively on the basis of syntactic information alone (Lappin and Leass 1994; Hardt 1997).

We used a subset of the Penn Treebank I corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz
1993) from the ACL/DCI CD-ROM, containing newspaper articles from the Wall Street
Journal. We divided the corpus into two parts: one, containing about 1,000 definite
descriptions, was used as a source during the development of the system; we will refer
to these texts as Corpus 1.4 The other part, containing about 400 definite descriptions,
was kept aside during development and used for testing; we will refer to this subset
as Corpus 2.4

2.2 Classifications of Anaphoric Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999471142857143">
The best-known studies of definite description use (Hawkins 1978; Prince 1992; Frau-
rud 1990; Lobner 1987; Clark 1977; Sidner 1979; Strand 1996) classify definite descrip-
tions on the basis of their relation with their antecedent. A fundamental distinction
made in these studies is between descriptions that denote the same discourse entity
as their antecedent (which we will call anaphoric or, following Fraurud, subsequent
mention), descriptions that denote an object that is in some way &amp;quot;associated&amp;quot; with the
antecedent-for example, it is part of it, as in a car . . the wheel (these definite expres-
sions are called &amp;quot;associative descriptions&amp;quot; by Hawkins and &amp;quot;inferrables&amp;quot; by Prince),
and descriptions that introduce a new entity into the discourse.
In the case of semantic identity between definite description and antecedent, a
further distinction can be made depending on the semantic relation between the pred-
icate used in the description and that used for the antecedent. The predicate used in
an anaphoric definite description may be a synonym of the predicate used for the an-
tecedent (a house . . . the home), a generalization /hypernym (an oak.. . the tree), and even,
sometimes, a specialization/hyponym (a tree.. . the oak). In fact, the NP introducing the
antecedent may not have a head noun at all, e.g., when a proper name is used, as in
Bill Clinton.. . the president. We will use the term direct anaphora when both description
and antecedent have the same head noun, as in a house. . the house. Direct anaphors are
the easiest definite descriptions for a shallow system to resolve; in all other cases, as
well as when the antecedent and the definite description are related in a more indirect
way, lexical knowledge, or more generally encyclopedic knowledge, is needed.
All of the classifications mentioned above also acknowledge the fact that not all
definite descriptions depend on the previous discourse for their interpretation. Some
refer to an entity in the physical environment, others to objects which are assumed to
be known on the basis of common knowledge (Prince&apos;s &amp;quot;discourse-new/hearer-old&amp;quot;
expressions, such as the pope), and still others are licensed by virtue of the semantics
of their head noun and complement (as in the fact that Milan won the Italian football
championship).

the one hand, by the desire to make the annotation uncomplicated for the subjects
employed in the empirical analysis and, on the other hand, by our intention to use the
annotation to get art estimate of how well a system using only limited lexical arid en-
cyclopedic knowledge could do.&apos; We ran two experiments, using two slightly different
classification schemes. In the first experiment we used the following three classes:&apos;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993646222222222">
• direct anaphora: subsequent-mention definite descriptions that refer to
an antecedent with the same head noun as the description;
• bridging descriptions: definite descriptions that either (i) have an
antecedent denoting the same discourse entity, but using a different head
noun (as in house ...budding), or (ii) are related by a relation other than
identity to an entity already introduced in the discourse;7
• discourse-new: first-mention definite descriptions that denote objects not
related by shared associative knowledge to entities already introduced in
the discourse.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998735428571429">
In the second experiment we treated all anaphoric definite descriptions as part of
one class (direct anaphora + bridging (i)), and all inferrables as part of a different class
(bridging (ii)), without significant changes in the agreement results.
Agreement among annotators was measured using the K statistic (Siegel and
Castellan 1988; Carletta 1996). K measures agreement among k annotators over and
above chance agreement (Siegel and Castellan 1988). The K coefficient of agreement is
defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.978886">
K— P(A) —P(E)
1— P(E)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941222222222">
where P(A) is the proportion of times the annotators agree, and P(E) the proportion of
times that we would expect them to agree by chance. The interpretation of K figures is
art open question, but in the field of content analysis, where reliability has long been
an issue (Krippendorff 1980), K &gt; 0.8 is generally taken to indicate good reliability,
whereas 0.68 &lt;K &lt; 0.8 allows tentative conclusions to be drawn. Carletta et al. (1997)
observe, however, that in other areas, such as medical research, much lower levels of
K are considered acceptable (Landis and Koch 1977).
An interesting overall result of our study was that the most reliable distinction that
our annotators could make was that between first-mention and subsequent-mention
(K = 0.76); the measure of agreement for the three-way distinction just discussed was
K = 0.73. The second interesting result concerned the distribution of definite descrip-
tions in the three classes above: we found that about half. of the definite descriptions
were discourse-new. The distribution of the definite descriptions in classes in our first
experiment according to annotators A and 13 are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respec-
tively. (Class IV includes cases of idiomatic expressions or doubts expressed by the
annotators).
The third main result was that we found very little agreement between our sub-
jects on identifying briding descriptions: in our second experiment, the agreement on

5 Previous attempts to annotate anaphoric relations had resulted in very low agreement levels; for
example, in the coreference annotation experiments for MUC-6 (Sundheim 1995), relations other than
identity were dropped due to difficulties in annotating them.
6 in this experiment, our subjects could also classify a definite description as &amp;quot;idiomatic&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;doubt&amp;quot;—see tables below,
7 In Poesio and Vieira (1998), Hawkins&apos;s term &amp;quot;associative&amp;quot; was used for this class; but in fact, the
definition we used for the class is closest to the sense of &amp;quot;bridging&amp;quot; used by Clark (1977).

bridging descriptions was K 0.24. This was due in part to the fact that many defi-
nite descriptions could be classified in more than one class (e.g., either anaphoric or
bridging, depending on which antecedent was chosen) and in part to the fact that
in the case of descriptions indirectly related to their antecedents, the discourse might
provide more than one distinct equally suitable anchor (Poesio and Vieira 1998). The
most common classification problem is distinguishing between larger situation and
bridging descriptions; see also Fraurud (1990) and Poesio and Vieira (1998).

3. A Model of Definite Description Processing Inspired by Empirical Studies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999485">
The results just discussed led us to adopt a model of definite descriptions process-
ing advanced in Fraurud (1990) and further elaborated in Poesio and Vieira (1998),
according to which interpreting definite descriptions in written discourse is not just
a matter of checking whether there is a suitable antecedent for the description, but
also involves a classification task: recognizing whether a description is, in Fraurud&apos;s
terms, first-mention or subsequent-mention—or, in our terminology, direct anaphora,
discourse-new, or bridging. The crucial aspect of Fraurucl&apos;s proposal is the idea that
interpreting definite descriptions is not just a matter of looking for an antecedent;
separate rules for recognizing first-mention definite descriptions are needed as well.
The fact that there was so much disagreement about bridging descriptions and
their anchors led us to try to keep the rules for processing them fairly separate from
those for processing other types of descriptions and to attempt to use agreement
measures to evaluate the performance of the system, in addition to more traditional
precision and recall figures.

<bodyText confidence="0.997976333333333">
The results discussed above further support Fraurud&apos;s (1990) criticism of the approach
to processing definite NPs based on the assumption that they are primarily anaphoric.
Because of the large proportion of first-mention definites found in the texts she exam-

ined, Fraurud (1990, 421) claims that:
a model where the processing of first-mention definites always in-
volves a failing search for an already established discourse referent as
a first step seems less attractive. A reverse ordering of the procedures
is, quite obviously, no solution to this problem, but a simultaneous
processing as proposed by Bosch and Geurts (1989) might be.
Fraurud proposes, contra Heim (1982), that processing a definite NP may in-
volve establishing a new discourse entity,8 This new discourse entity may then be
linked to one or more anchors in the text or to a background referent.&apos; Fraurud dis-
cusses the example of the description the king, interpreted relationally, encountered in
a text in which no king has been previously mentioned. Lexicoencyclopedic knowl-
edge would provide the information that a king is related to a period and a country;
these would constitute the anchors. The selection of the anchors would identify the
pertinent period and country, and this would make possible the identification of a
referent: say, for the anchors 1989 and Sweden, the referent identified would be Carl
Gustav XVI.°
The most interesting aspect of Fraurucl&apos;s proposal is the hypothesis that first-
mention definites are not necessarily recognized simply because no suitable antecedent
has been found; independent strategies for recognizing them may be involved. This
hypothesis is consistent with LObner&apos;s proposal (Lobner 1987) that the fundamental
property of a definite description is that it denotes a function (in a logical sense); this
function can be part of the meaning assigned to the definite description by the gram-
mar (as in the beginning of X), or can be specified by context (as in the case of anaphoric
definites). Fraurud&apos;s and Lobner&apos;s ideas can be translated into a requirement that a
system have separate methods or rules for recognizing discourse-new descriptions
(and in particular, Lobner&apos;s &amp;quot;semantically functional&amp;quot; definites) in addition to rules
for resolving anaphoric definite descriptions; these rules may run in parallel with the
rules for resolving anaphoric definites, rather than after them.
Rather than deciding a priori on the question of whether the heuristic rules (in
our case) for identifying discourse-new descriptions should be run in parallel with
resolution or after it, we treated this as an empirical question. We made the archi-
tecture of the system fairly modular, so that we could both try different heuristics
and try applying them in a different order, using the corpus for evaluation. We dis-
cuss all the heuristics that we tried in Section 4, and our evaluation of them in Sec-
tion 5.

The overall architecture of our system is shown in Figure 1. The system attempts to
classify each definite description as either direct anaphora,. discourse-new, or bridging
description. In addition to this classification, the system tries to identify the antecedents
of anaphoric descriptions and the anchors (Fraurud 1990) of bridging descriptions. The

10 Fraurud does not explain what it is that justifies the use of definite descriptions, if not familiarity. In
Poesio and Vieira (1998) we suggest that LObner&apos;s proposal (Liiihner 1987) seems to account for the

system processes parsed newswire texts from the Penn Treebank I, constructing a fairly
simple discourse model that consists of a list of discourse entities that may serve as
potential antecedents (which we call simply potential antecedents), according to the
chosen segmentation algorithm (see below). The system uses the discourse model,
syntactic information, and a small amount of lexical information to classify definite
descriptions as discourse-new or to link them to anchors in the text; WordNet is also
consulted by the version of the system that attempts to resolve bridging descriptions.
The system is implemented in Sicstus Prolog.

Input. The texts in the Penn Treebank corpus consist of parsed sentences represented
as Lisp lists. During a preprocessing phase, a representation in Prolog list format
is produced for each sentence, and the noun phrases it contains are extracted. The
output of this preprocessing phase is passed to the system proper. For example, the
sentence in (1) is represented in the Treebank as (2) and the input to the system after the
preprocessing phase is (3).&apos; Note that all nested NPs are extracted, and that embedded
NPs such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are processed before the

dealing with segmentation and to handle modification.
• for identifying discourse-new descriptions. Some of these heuristics
attempt to recognize semantically functional definite descriptions
(Hawkins 1978; LObner 1987), whereas others try to recognize definite
descriptions that are anchored via their modification (Clark and Marshall

• for identifying the anchor of a bridging description and the semantic
relation between the bridging description and its anchor. WordNet is

the basis of an extensive evaluation of the heuristics using the corpus annotated in our
previous work (Poesio and Vieira 1998). The evaluation was used both to determine
which version of each heuristic worked better, and to identify the best order in which
to try them.

4.1 Direct Anaphora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976666666667">
Our system&apos;s strategy for resolving direct anaphora is very simple: it just looks for a
potential antecedent whose head matches the head noun of the definite description.
The key issues to address in doing this are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.889632">
• how to identify the potential antecedents, and
• how to match the definite descriptions with the potential antecedents.
Performing each of these tasks may potentially involve complex syntactic analysis and
general reasoning; we will discuss our heuristic solutions to them in turn.
4.1.1 Identifying Head Nouns. In order to resolve an anaphoric description, it is
necessary to identify its head noun, which in the parsed texts of the Penn Treebank is
generally the rightmost atom in the NP. For example, the nouns politics and squabbling
are the heads of the following NPs:
(4) a.
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.549683">
[NP,Mideast ,politics] ;
b.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.889498833333333">
CNP ,the , squabbling , [PP,within, [NP,the,Organization...]]] .
Although this strategy works most of the time, it does have some problems. One
of these problems are headless definites (such as the highest in the southern region).
A second problem are definites whose head is not represented in the Treebank as
an atom at the determiner level (such as, INP,The,[NP,ENP,20001,INP,tax1i1). Corpus 1, for
example, contains 17 definite descriptions with these problems (0.2%). A third problem

is coordination: for example, our algorithm does not recognize that a noun such as
reporters below is a head noun:
ENP,reporters,and,editors,[PP,of,[NP,The,WSJ11].
4.1.2 Potential Antecedents. The second problem is to determine which NPs should
be used to resolve definite descriptions, among all those in the text. The system keeps
track of NP index, NP structure, head noun, and NP type (definite, indefinite, bare
plural, possessive&apos;) of each potential antecedent, as illustrated by (5) below.

We found that different recall/precision trade-offs can be achieved depending on the
choice of potential antecedents—i.e., depending on whether all NPs are considered
as possible antecedents, or only indefinite NPs, or various other subsets—so we ran
experiments to identify the best group of potential antecedents. Four different NP

some and bare/cardinal plurals, as in (7a);&apos;

3. indefinite NPs, definite descriptions, and possessive NPs (NPs with a
possessive pronoun or possessive mark) ((7a), (7b) and (7c));
4. all NPs ((7a), (7b), (7c)) and (7d)).

<bodyText confidence="0.983185416666667">
The results obtained by considering each subset of the total number of NPs as potential
antecedents are discussed in Section 5.2.
4.1.3 Segmentation. The set of potential antecedents of anaphoric expressions is also
restricted by the fact that antecedents tend to have a limited &amp;quot;life span&amp;quot;—i.e., they
only serve as antecedents for anaphoric expressions within pragmatically determined
segments of the whole text (see, for example, Reichman [1985], Grosz and Sidner
[1986] and Fox [1987]). In our corpus we found that about 10% of direct anaphoric
definite descriptions have more than one possible antecedent if segmentation is not
taken into account (Vieira and Poesio 1996). In (8), for example, the antecedent of
the housej mentioned in sentence 50 is not the house mentioned earlier in sentences 2
and 19, but another (nonrnobile) house implicitly introduced in sentence 49 by the
reference to the yard.

In general, it is not sufficient to look at the most recent antecedents only: this
is because segments are organized hierarchically, and the antecedents introduced in
a segment at a lower level are typically not accessible from a segment at a higher
level (Fox 1987; Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman. 1985), whereas the
antecedents introduced in a prior segment at the same level may be. Later in (8),
for example, the house; in sentence 50 becomes inaccessible again, and in sentence 65,
the text starts referring again to the house introduced in sentence 2. Automatically
recognizing the hierarchical structure of texts is an unresolved problem, as it involves
reasoning about intentions;14 better results have been achieved on the simpler task of
&amp;quot;chunking&amp;quot; the text into sequences of segments, generally by means of lexical density
measures (Hearst 1997; Richmond, Smith, and Amitay 1997).
The methods for limiting the life span of discourse entities that we considered
for our system are even simpler. One type of heuristic we looked at are window-
based techniques, i.e., considering only the antecedents within fixed-size windows of
previous sentences, although we allow some discourse entities to have a longer life
span: we call this method loose segmentation. More specifically, a discourse entity
is considered a potential antecedent for a definite description when the antecedent&apos;s
head is identical to the description&apos;s head, and
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99925475">
• the potential antecedent is within the established window, or else
• the potential antecedent is itself a subsequent mention, or else
• the definite description and the antecedent are identical NPs (including
the article).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6029564">
We also considered an even simpler recency heuristic: this involves keeping a table
indexed by the heads of potential antecedents, such that the entry for noun N contains
the index of the last occurrence of an antecedent with head N. Finally, we considered
combinations of segmentation and recency. (The results of these two heuristics are
compared in Section 5.2.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.89981225">
4.1.4 Noun Modifiers. Once the head nouns of the antecedent and of the description
have been identified, the system attempts to match them. This head-matching strategy
works correctly in simple cases like (9):
(9) Grace Energy hauled a rig here ... The rig was built around 1980.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999496833333333">
In general, however, when matching a definite description with a potential an-
tecedent the information provided by the prenon-tinal and the postnominal part of the
noun phrases also has to be taken into account. For example, a blue car cannot serve
as the antecedent for the red car, or the house on the left for the house on the right. In our
corpus, cases of antecedents that would incorrectly match by simply matching heads
without regarding premodificatiort include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.804610333333333">

<bodyText confidence="0.84363625">
Vieira and Poesio Processing Definite Descriptions
Again, taking proper account of the semantic contribution of these premodifiers would,
in general, require commonsense reasoning. For the moment, we only developed
heuristic solutions to the problem, including:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.979571444444444">
• allowing an antecedent to match with a definite description if the
premodifiers of the description are a subset of the premodifiers of the
antecedent. This heuristic deals with definites that contain less
information than the antecedent, such as an old Victorian house . . the
house, and prevents matches such as the business community . . . the
younger, more activist black political community.
• allowing a nonpremodified antecedent to match with any same head
definite. This second heuristic deals with definites that contain additional
information, such as a check . . . the lost check.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985515">
The information that two discourse entities are disjoint may come from postmod-
ification, as well, although same head antecedents with different postrnodification are
not as common as those with differences in premodification. An example from Our
Corpus is shown in (11).

like himself could run Pinkerton&apos;s better than an unfocused conglomerate or
investment banker.
The heuristic method we developed to deal with postmodification is to compare the
description and antecedent, preventing resolution in those cases where both are post-
modified and the modifications are not the same. (These results are also discussed in
Section 5.2.)

4.2 Discourse-New Descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945">
As mentioned above, a fundamental characteristic of our system is that it also includes
heuristics for recognizing discourse-new descriptions (i.e., definite descriptions that
introduce new discourse entities) on the basis of syntactic and lexical features of the
noun phrase. Our heuristics are based on the discussion in Hawkins (1978), who
identified a number of correlations between certain types of syntactic structure and
discourse-new descriptions, particularly those he called &amp;quot;unfamiliar&amp;quot; definites (i.e.,
those whose existence cannot be expected to be known on the basis of generally
shared knowledge), including:15
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.601473">
• the presence of &amp;quot;special predicates&amp;quot;:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970364125">
- the occurrence of premodifiers such as first or best when
accompanied with full relatives, e.g., the first person to sail to
America (Hawkins calls these &amp;quot;unexplanatory modifiers&amp;quot;; Lobner
15 Hawkins himself proposes a transformation-based account of unfamiliar definites, but the correlations
he identified proved to be a useful source of heuristics for identifying these uses of definite
descriptions even though the existence of counterexamples to these heuristics suggests that a
syntactic-based account cannot be entirely correct. Most of these examples can be accounted for in
terms of Lobner&apos;s theory of definiteness.

</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9584327">
- a head noun taking a complement such as the fact that there is life
on Earth (Hawkins calls this subclass &amp;quot;NP complements&amp;quot;);
• the presence of restrictive modification, as in the inequities of the current
land-ownership system.
Our system attempts to recognize these syntactic patterns. We also added heuristics
classifying as unfamiliar some definites occurring in
• appositive constructions (e.g., Glenn Cox, the president of Phillips
Petroleum Co.);
• copular constructions (e.g., the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a
career politician named David Dinkins).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999208625">
(The reason definite descriptions in appositive and copular constructions tend to be
discourse-new, in fact unfamiliar, is that the information needed for the identification
is given by the NP to which the apposition is attached and the predicative part of the
copular construction, respectively&apos;)
Finally, we found that three classes of what Hawkins called &amp;quot;larger situation&amp;quot;
definites (those whose existence can be assumed to be known on the basis of encyclo-
pedic knowledge, such as the pope) can also be recognized on the basis of heuristics
exploiting syntactic and lexical features:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997586">
• defiruites that behave like proper nouns, like the United States;
• definites that have proper nouns in their premodification, such as the
Iran-Iraq war;
• definites referring to time, such as the time or the morning.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997585">
In our corpus study we found that our subjects did much better at identifying
discourse-new descriptions all together (K = 0.68) than they did at distinguishing
unfamiliar from larger situation cases (K -= 0.63). This finding was confirmed by our
implementation: although each of the heuristics is designed, in principle, to identify
only one of the uses (larger situation or unfamiliar), they work better at identifying
together the whole class of discourse-new descriptions.

4.2.1 Special Predicates. Some cases of discourse-new definite descriptions can be

<bodyText confidence="0.981137444444444">
identified by comparing the head noun or modifiers of the definite NP with a list of
predicates that are either functional or likely to take a complement (Lbbner 1987). Our
list of predicates that, when taking NP complements, are generally used to introduce
discourse-new entities, was compiled by hand and currently includes the nouns fact,
result, conclusion, idea, belief, saying, and remark. In these cases, what licenses the use of
a definite is not anaphoricity, but the fact that the head noun can be interpreted as
16 In the systems participating in MUC, definite descriptions occurring in appositions are treated as
anaphoric on the preceding NP; our system considers the NP and the apposition as a unit that
introduces a new referent to the discourse.

semantically functional; the noun complement specifies the argument of the function.
Functionality is enough to license the use of the definite description (Lobner 1987). An
example of definite description classified as discourse-new on these grounds is given
in (12).

Mr. Dinkins has.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982646">
When encountering a definite whose head noun occurs in this list, the system
checks if a complement is present or if the definite appears in a copular construction
(e.g., the fact is that. . .).
A second list of special predicates consulted by the system includes what Hawkins
called unexplanatory modifiers: these include adjectives such as first, last, best, most,
maximum, minimum, and only and superlatives in general.&apos;. All of these adjectives are
predicate modifiers that turn a head noun into a function, therefore again—according
to Lobrter—licensing the use of a definite even when no antecedent is present (see
examples below). When applying this heuristic, the system verifies the presence of a
complement for some of the modifiers (first, last), but not for superlatives.

Finally, our system uses a list of special predicates that we found to correlate well
with larger situation uses (i.e., definite descriptions referring to objects whose existence
is generally known). This list consists mainly of terms indicating time reference, and
includes the nouns hour, time, morning, afternoon, night, day, week, month, period, quarter,
year, and their respective plurals. An example from the corpus is:
(14) Only 14,505 wells were drilled for oil and natural gas in the U.S. in the
first nine months of the year.
Other definites typically used with a larger situation interpretation are the moon,
the sky, the pope, and the weather.
It should be noted that although these constructions may indicate a discourse-
new interpretation, these expressions may also be used anaphorically; this is one of
the cases in which a decision has to be made concerning the relative priority of differ-
ent heuristics. We discuss this issue further in connection with the evaluation of the
system&apos;s performance in Section 5.18
4.2.2 Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Modification. A second set of heuristics for iden-

from our corpus analysis look for restrictive modification.&amp;quot; We developed patterns
to recognize restrictive postmodification and nonrestrictive postmodification; we also
tested the correlation between discourse novelty and premodification. We discuss each
of these heuristics in turn.
Restrictive Postmodification. Hawkins (1978) pointed out that unfamiliar defirtites often
include referent-establishing relative clauses and associative clauses, while warning
that not all relative clauses are referent-establishing. Some statistics about this corre-
lation were reported by Fraurud (1990): she found that in her corpus 75% of complex
definite NPs (i.e., modified by genitives, postposed PPs, restrictive adjectival modifiers)
were first-mention. A great number of definite descriptions with restrictive postmod-
ifiers are unfamiliar in our corpus as well (Poesio and Vieira 1998); in fact, restrictive
postmodification was found to be the single most frequent feature of first-mention de-
scriptions. Constructions of this type are good indicators of discourse novelty because
a restrictive poshnodifier may license the use of a definite description either by pro-
viding a link to the rest of the discourse (as in Prince&apos;s &amp;quot;containing inferrables&amp;quot;) or by
making the description into a functional concept. Looking for restrictive postmodifiers
might therefore be a good way of identifying discourse-new descriptions.
The distribution of restrictive postmodifiers in our corpus is shown in Table 3;
examples of each type of postmodifier are given below.
Relative clauses: these are finite clauses sometimes (but not always)
introduced by relative pronouns such as who, whom, which, where, when,
why, and that:

clauses.
(16) a. The man writing the letter is my friend.
b. The man to consult is Wilson.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99603475">
Prepositional phrases and of-clauses: Quirk et al. (1985) found that
prepositional phrases are the most common type of postmodification in
English—three or four times more frequent than either finite or nonfinite
clausal postmodification. This was confirmed by our corpus study (see
19 The term restrictive modification is used when the modifier provides information that is essential to
identify the discourse entity referred to by the NP (Quirk et al. 1985). The modification is nonrestrictive
when the head provides sufficient information to identify the discourse entity, so that the information
provided by the modification is not essential for identification.

Restrictive Prernodification. Restrictive modification is not as common in prenominal
position as in posthead position, but it is often used, and was also found to correlate
well with larger situation and unfamiliar uses of definite descriptions (Poesio and
Vieira 1998). A restrictive premodifier may be a noun (as in (21)), a proper noun, or
an adjective.&apos; Sometimes numerical figures (usually referring to dates) are used as
restrictive premodifiers, as in (22)).
(21) A native of the area, he is back now after riding the oil-field boom to the
top, then surviving the bust running an Oklahoma City convenience
store.

The heuristic we tested was to classify definite descriptions premodified by a proper
noun as larger situation.
4.2.3 Appositions. During our corpus analysis we found additional syntactic patterns
that appeared to correlate well with discourse novelty yet had not been discussed
by Hawkins, such as definite descriptions occurring in appositive constructions: they
usually refer to the NP modified by the apposition, therefore there is no need for the
system to look for an antecedent. Appositive constructions are treated in the Treebank
as NP modifiers; therefore the system recognizes an apposition by checking whether
the definite occurs in a complex noun phrase with a structure consisting of a sequence
of noun phrases (which might be separated by commas, or not) one of which is a
name or is premodified by a name, as in the examples in (23).

In fact a definite description may itself be modified by an apposition, e.g., an indefinite
NP, as shown by (24). Such cases of appositive constructions are also recognized by
the system.

Other examples of apposition recognized by the system are:

21 Our system cannot distinguish adjectives or verbs from nouns in premoclification because it works
directly off the parsed version of the Treebank, without looking at part-of-speech tags.

often involve discourse-new descriptions. We developed the following heuristic for
handling copula constructions. If a description occurs in subject position, the system
looks at the VP. If the head of the VP is the verb to be, to seem, or to become, and the
complement of the verb is not an adjectival phrase, the system classifies the description
as discourse-new. Two examples correctly handled by this heuristic are shown in (26);
the syntactic representation of these cases in the Penn Treebank I is shown in (27).

If the complement of the verb is an adjective, the subject is typically interpreted

The first appearance of these definite descriptions in the text is usually a discourse-

4.3 Bridging Descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977226555555556">
Bridging descriptions are the definite descriptions that a shallow processing system
is least equipped to handle. Linguistic and computational theories of bridging de-
scriptions identify two main subtasks involved in their resolution: finding the element
in the text to which the bridging description is related (anchor) and identifying the
relation (link) holding between the bridging description and its anchor (Clark 1977;
Sidner 1979; Heim 1982; Carter 1987; Fraurud 1990; Strand 1996). The speaker is li-
censed to use a bridging description when he or she can assume that the commonsense

knowledge required to identify the relation is shared by the listener (Hawkins 1978;
Clark and Marshall 1981; Prince 1981). This dependence on commonsense knowledge
means that, in general, a system can only resolve bridging descriptions when supplied
with an adequate knowledge base; for this reason, the typical way of implementing
a system for resolving bridging descriptions has been to restrict the domain and feed
the system with hand-coded world knowledge (see, for example, Sidner [1979] and
especially Carter [1987]). A broader view of bridging phenomena (not only bridging
descriptions) is presented in Hahn, Strube, and Markert (1996). They make use of a
knowledge base from which they extract conceptual links to feed an adaptation of the
centering model (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).
The relation between bridging descriptions and their anchors may be arbitrarily
complex (Clark 1977; Sidner 1979; Prince 1981; Strand 1996), and the same description
may relate to different anchors in a text: this makes it difficult to decide what the
intended anchor and the intended link are (Poesio and Vieira 1998). For all these
reasons, this class has been the most challenging problem we have dealt with in the
development of our system, and the results we have obtained so far can only be
considered very preliminary. Nevertheless, we feel that trying to process these definite
descriptions is the only way to discover which types of commonsense knowledge are
actually needed.

4.4 Types of Bridging Descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999718333333333">
Our work on bridging descriptions began with the development of a classification of
bridging descriptions (Vieira and Teufel 1997) according to the kind of information
needed to resolve them, rather than on the basis of the possible relations between
descriptions and their anchors as is typical in the literature. This allowed us to get
an estimate of what types of bridging descriptions we might expect our system to
resolve. The classification is as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999157117647059">
• cases based on well-defined lexical relations, such as synonymy,
hypernymy, and meronymy, that can be found in a lexical database such
as WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), as in the flat . the living room;
• bridging descriptions in which the antecedent is a proper name and the
description a common noun, whose resolution requires some way of
recognizing the type of object denoted by the proper name, as in Bach .
the composer;
• cases in which the anchor is not the head noun but a noun modifying an
antecedent, as in the company has been selling discount packages . the
discounts
• cases in which the antecedent (anchor) is not introduced by an NP but
by a VP, as in Krulane oil is currently drilling two oil wells. The activity .
• descriptions whose antecedent is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but
is implicitly available because it is a discourse topic, e.g., the industry in a
text referring to oil companies;
• cases in which the relation with the anchor is based on more general
commonsense knowledge, e.g., about cause-consequence relations.

to entities introduced by nonhead nouns in a compound nominal (Poesio, Vieira, and
Teufel 1997).
4.4.1 Bridging Descriptions and WordNet. In order to get a system that could be eval-
uated on a corpus containing texts in different domains, we used WordNet (Fellbaum
1998) as an approximation of a lexical knowledge source. We developed a WordNet
interface (Vieira and Teufel 1997) that reports a possible semantic link between two
nouns when one of the following is true:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997588">
• the nouns are in the same synset (i.e., they are synonyms of each other),
as in suit/lawsuit;
• the nouns are in a hyponymy/hypernymy relation with each other, as in
dollar/currency;
• there is a direct or indirect meronymy/holonymy (part of/has parts)
relation between them, as in door/house;
• the nouns are coordinate sisters, i.e. hyponyms of the same hypernyrn,
such as home/house, which are hyponyms of housing, lodging.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999842333333333">
Sometimes, finding a relation between two predicates involves complex searches
through WordNet&apos;s hierarchy. For example, there may be no relation between two
head nouns, but there is a relation between compound nouns in which these nouns
appear: thus, there is no semantic relation between record/album, but only a synonymy
relation between record _album/album . We found that extended searches of this type, or
searches for indirect meronymy relations, yielded extremely low recall and precision at
a very high computational cost; both types of search were dropped at the begirming of
the tests we ran to process the corpus consulting WordNet (Poesio, Vieira, and Teufel
1997). The results of our tests with WordNet are presented in Section 5.4.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99934215">
that refer back to entities introduced by proper names (such as Pinkerton Inc . . the
company) are very common in newspaper articles. Processing such descriptions requires
determining an entity type for each name in the text, that is, if we recognize Pinkerton
Inc. as an entity of type company, we can then resolve the subsequent description
the company, or even a description such as the firm by finding a synonymy relation
between company and firm using WordNet.
This so-called named entity recognition task has received considerable attention
recently (Mani and MacMillan 1996; McDonald 1996; Paik et al. 1996; Bikel et al.
1997; Palmer and Day 1997; Wacholder and Ravin 1997; Mikheev, Moens, and Grover
1999) and was one of the tasks evaluated in the Sixth and Seventh Message Under-
standing Conferences. In MUC-6, 15 different systems participated in the competition
(Sundheirri 1995). For the version of the system discussed and evaluated here, we im-
plemented a preliminary algorithm for named entity recognition that we developed
ourselves; a more recent version of the system (1shikawa 1998) uses the named en-
tity recognition software developed by HCRC for the MUC-7 competition (Mikheev,
Moens, and Grover 1999).
WordNet contains the types of a few names—typically, of famous people, coun-
tries, states, cities, and languages. Other entity types can be identified using appositive
constructions and abbreviations (such as Mr, Co., and Inc.) as cues. Our algorithm for
assigning a type to proper names is based on a mixture of the heuristics just described.

<bodyText confidence="0.938762392857143">
The system first looks for the above-mentioned cues to try to identify the name type. If
no cue is found, pairs consisting of the proper name and each of the elements from the
list country, city, state, continent, language, person are consulted in our WordNet interface
to verify the existence of a semantic relation.
The recall of this algorithm was increased by including a backtracking mechanism
that reprocesses a text, filling in the discourse representation with missing name types.
With this mechanism we can identify later the type for the name Morishita in a textual
sequence in which the first occurrence of the name does not provide surface indication
of the entity type: e.g., Morishita . . . Mr. Morishita. The second mention includes such
a clue (Mr.); by processing the text twice, we recover such missing types.
After finding the types for names, the system uses the techniques previously de-
scribed for same-head matching or WordNet lookup to match the descriptions with
the types found for previous named entities.
4.4.3 Compound Nouns. Sometimes, the anchor for a bridging description is a non-
head noun in a compound noun:
(31) stock market crash . . . the markets;
One way to process these definite descriptions would be to update the discourse
model with discourse referents not only for the NP as a whole, but also for the em-
bedded nouns. For example, after processing stock market crash, we could introduce a
discourse referent for stock market, and another discourse referent for stock market crash.23
The description the markets would be coreferring with the first of these referents (with
an identical head noun), and then we could simply use our anaphora resolution algo-
rithms. This solution, however, makes available discourse referents that are generally
inaccessible for anaphora (Postal 1969). For example, it is generally accepted that in
(32), a deer is not accessible for anaphoric reference.&apos;
(32) I saw la deeri hunter]. 1t7 was dead.
Therefore, we followed a different route. Our algorithm for identifying anchors at-
tempts to match not only heads with heads, but also:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.791997375">
1. The head of a description with the premodifiers of a previous NP:
(33) the stock market crash . . the markets;
2. The premodifiers of a description with the premodifiers of its
antecedents:
(34) his art business . . the art gallery.
3. And finally, the premodifiers of the description with the head of a
previous NP:
(35) a 15-acre plot and main home the home site.
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.71175725">
23 Note that the collection of potential antecedents containing all NPs will just have the NY head crash for
stock market crash. The system considers the whole NP structure as only one discourse referent,
according to the structure of the Penn Treebank: [NP,the,1987,stock,market,crash]
24 These proposed constraints have been challenged by Ward, Sproat, and McKoon (1991).

5. Evaluation of the Heuristics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934454545454">
In this section we discuss the tests we ran to arrive at a final configuration of the
system. The performance of the heuristics discussed in Section 4 was evaluated by
comparing the results of the system with the human annotation of the corpus pro-
duced during the experiments discussed in Poesio and Vieira (1998). Several variants
of our heuristics were tried using Corpus 1 as training data; after deciding upon an
optimal version, our algorithms were evaluated using Corpus 2 as test data. Because
our proposals concerning bridging descriptions are much less developed than those
concerning anaphoric descriptions and discourse-new descriptions, we ran separate
evaluations of two versions of the system: Version 1, which does not attempt to re-
solve bridging descriptions, and Version 2, which does; we will point out below which
version of the system is considered in each evaluation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.817265">
5.1 Evaluation Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976596391304348">
The fact that the annotators working on our corpus did not always agree either on
the classification of a definite description or on its anchor raises the question of how
to evaluate the performance of our system. We tried two different approaches: eval-
uating the performance of the system by measuring its precision and recall against a
standardized annotation based on majority voting (as done in MUC), and measuring
the extent of the system&apos;s agreement with the rest of the annotators by means of the
same metric used to measure agreement among the annotators themselves (the kappa
statistic). We used the first form of evaluation to measure both the performance of
the single heuristics and the performance of the system as a whole; the agreement
measure was only used to measure the overall performance of the system. We discuss
each of these in turn.&amp;quot;
5.1.1 Precision and Recall. Recall and precision are measures commonly used in In-
formation Retrieval to evaluate a system&apos;s performance. Recall is the percentage of
correct answers reported by the system in relation to the number of cases indicated
by the annotated corpus:
R number of correct responses
number of cases
whereas precision is the percentage of correctly reported results in relation to the total
reported:
p number of correct responses
number of responses
These two measures may be combined to form one measure of performance, the F
measure, which is computed as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.976059">
F(W + 1)RP
(WR) + P
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997799">
W represents the relative weight of recall to precision and typically has the value 1.
A single measure gives us a balance between the two results; 100% of recall may be
due to a precision of 0% and vice versa. The F measure penalizes both very low recall
and very low precision.

and recall figures for the different variants of the system were obtained by com-
paring the classification produced by each version with a standardized annotation,
extracted from the annotations produced by our human annotators by majority judge-
ment: whenever at least two of the three coders agreed on a class, that class was chosen.
Details of how the standard annotation was obtained are given in Vieira (1998).2&apos;
The system&apos;s performance as a classifier was automatically evaluated against the
standard annotation of the corpus as follows. Each NP in a text is given an index:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.751779">
(36) A house106 The house&apos; 35
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.932442333333333">
When a text is annotated or processed, the coder or system associates each index of a
definite description with a type of use; both the standard annotation and the system&apos;s
output are represented as Prolog assertions.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6986685">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97439775">
To assess the system&apos;s performance on the identification of a coreferential an-
tecedent, it is necessary to compare the links that indicate the antecedent of each de-
scription classified as anaphora. These links are also represented as Prolog assertions,
as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.32372">

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999415285714286">
The system uses these assertions to build an equivalence class of discourse entities,
called a coreference chain. When comparing an antecedent indicated by the system
for a given definite description with that in the annotated corpus, the corresponding
coreference chain is checked—that is, the system&apos;s indexes and the annotated indexes
do not need to be exactly the same as long as they belong to the same coreference
chain. In this way, both (40a) and (40b) would be evaluated as correct answers if the
corpus is annotated with the links shown in (39).

In the end, we still need to check the results manually, because our annotated coref-
erence chains are not complete: our annotators did not annotate all types of anaphoric
expressions, so it may happen that the system indicates as antecedent an element out-
side an annotated coreference chain, such as a bare noun or possessive. In (41), for
example, suppose that all references to the house are coreferential:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.658811">
(41) A house-106... The house135 ... His house140 ... The house154
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.964233538461539">
coref(154,140).
If NP 135 is indicated as the antecedent for NP 154 in the corpus annotation (so that
140 is not part of the annotated coreference chain), and the system indicates 140 as the
antecedent for 154, an error is reported by the automatic evaluation, even though all
of these NPs refer to the same entity. A second consequence of the fact that the coref-
erence chains in our standard annotation are not complete is that in the evaluation of
direct anaphora resolution, we only verify if the antecedents indicated are correct; we
do not evaluate how complete the coreferential chains produced by the system are. By
contrast, in the evaluation of the MUC coreference task, where all types of referring
expressions are considered, the resulting co-reference chains are evaluated, rather than
just the indicated antecedent (Vilain et al. 1995). Even our limited notion of corefer-
ence chain was, nevertheless, very helpful in the automatic evaluation, considerably
reducing the number of cases to be checked manually.

by measuring its agreement with the annotators using the K statistic we used in Poesio

our tests comparatively, rather than absolutely, (by comparing better and worse levels

we wanted to establish the coreferential relations among discourse NPs as precisely
as possible.

limiting the life span of discourse entities. The first segmentation heuristic discussed
there, loose segmentation, is window based, but the restriction on sentence distance
is relaxed (i.e., the resolver will consider an antecedent outside the window) when
either:
• the antecedent is itself a subsequent-mention; or
• the antecedent is identical to the definite description being resolved
(including the article).

within the current window will be indicated as a possible antecedent. Therefore, when
evaluating the system&apos;s results, we may find that all antecedents indicated for the
resolution of a description were right, or some were right and some wrong, or that all
were wrong. The recall and precision figures reported here relate to those cases were
all resolutions indicated were right according to the annotated corpus.
In Section 4.1 we also discussed a second segmentation heuristic, which we called
recency: the system does not collect all candidate NPs as potential antecedents, but
only keeps the last occurrence of an NP from all those having the same head noun,
and there are no restrictions regarding the antecedent&apos;s distance.
The results of these two methods for different window sizes are shown in Ta-
ble 5. The results in this table were obtained by considering as potential antecedents
indefinites (i.e., NPs with determiners a, an, and some; bare NPs; and cardinal plurals),
possessives, and definite descriptions, as in Vieira and Poesio (1996); we also used the
premodification heuristics proposed there. Alternatives to these heuristics were also
evaluated; the results are discussed later in this section.
The resulting F measures were almost the same for all heuristics, but there was
clearly an increase in recall with a loss of precision when enlarging the window size.&amp;quot;
The recency heuristic had the best recall, but the lowest precision, although not much
lower than the others. The best precision was achieved with a one-sentence window,
and recall was not dramatically affected, but this only happened because the window
size constraint was relaxed.
To show what happens when a strict version of the window-based segmentation
approach is used, consider Table 6. (Strict segmentation means that the system only
considers those antecedents that are inside the sentence window for resolving a de-
scription, with no exceptions.) As the table shows, this form of segmentation results
in higher precision, but has a strong negative effect on recall. The overall F values are
all worse than for the heuristics in Table 5.
Finally, we tried a combination of the recency and segmentation heuristics: just one
potential antecedent for each different head noun is available for resolution, the last
27 In our experiments small differences in recall, precision, and F measures are frequent. We generally
assume in this paper that such differences are not significant, but a more formal significance test along
the lines of that in Chinchor (1995) will eventually be necessary to verify this.

the recency and loose segmentation approaches to segmentation we obtain a better
trade-off between recall and precision than using each heuristic separately. The version
with higher F value in Table 7 (four-sentence window plus recency) was chosen as
standard and used in the tests discussed in the rest of this section.

of potential antecedents discussed in Section 4.1, using four-sentence-window loose
segmentation with recency. In an earlier version of the system (Vieira and Poesio 1996),
only those definite descriptions that were not resolved with a same-head antecedent
were considered as potential antecedents; resolved definite descriptions would be
linked to previous NPs, but would not be made available for subsequent resolution.
(The idea was that the same antecedent used in one resolution could be used to resolve
all subsequent mentions cospecifying with that definite description.) An important dif-
ference between that implementation and the current one is that in the new version,
the definites resolved by the system are also made available as potential antecedents of
subsequent definites. This is because in our previous prototype, errors in identifying
an indefinite antecedent were sometimes propagated through a coreference chain, so
that the right antecedent would be missed. The results are shown in Table 8.
If we only consider indefinites as potential antecedents, recall is extremely low
(12%); we also get the worst precision. In other words, considering only indefinites
for the resolution of definite descriptions is too restrictive; this is because our corpus
contains a large number of first-mention definite descriptions that serve as antecedents
for subsequent references (similar results were also reported in Fraurud [1990]). The
version with the highest precision (88%) is the one that only considers indefinites and
definite descriptions as antecedents, but recall is lower compared to the version that
considered other NPs. We chose, as the basis for further testing, a version that combines
near-optimal values for F and precision, i.e., the version that takes indefinites, definite
descriptions, and possessives (first row in Table 8).
5.2.3 Premodifiers. Finally, we tested our heuristics for dealing with premodifiers. We
tested the matching algorithm from Vieira and Poesio (1996) in the present version
of the system; the results are presented in Table 9. In that table, we also show the

results obtained with a modified matching algorithm including a third rule, which
allows a premodified antecedent to match with a definite whose set of premodifiers
is a superset of the set of modifiers of the antecedent (an elaboration of rule 2). We
tested each of these three heuristics alone and in combination. (The fourth line simply
repeats the results shown in Table 7.)
The main result of this evaluation is that using a modified segmentation heuristic
(including recency) reduces the overall impact of the heuristics for premodification on
the performance of the algorithm in comparison with the system discussed in Vieira
and Poesio (1996). The best precision is still achieved by the matching algorithm that
does not allow for new information in the anaphoric expression, but the best results
overall are again obtained by combining rule 1 and rule 2, although either 2 or 3 works
equally well when combined with 1. (Note that the combination of heuristics 2 and 3
is equivalent to heuristic 3 alone, since rule 3 subsumes rule 2.) Heuristic 2 and 3 alone
are counterintuitive and indeed give the poorest results; however, the impact is greater
on recall than precision, which suggests that the introduction of new information in
noun modification is not very frequent.
One of the problems with our premodifier heuristics is that although a difference in
premodification usually indicates noricoreference, as for the company&apos;s abrasive segment
and the engineering materials segment, there are a few cases in our corpus in which
coreferent descriptions have totally different premodification from their antecedents,
as in
(42) the pixie-like clarinetist . . . the soft-spoken clarinetist.
These cases would be hard even for a system using real commonsense reasoning, since
often the information in the premodifier is new; we consider these examples one of the
best arguments for including in the system a focus-tracking mechanism along the lines
of Sidner (1979). Our heuristic matching algorithm also suggests wrong antecedents
in cases like the rules in (43), when the last mention refers to a modified concept (the
new rules are different from the previous ones).

In Table 10 we present the overall results on anaphora classification and anaphora
resolution for the version of the system that does not attempt to resolve bridging
descriptions, for both training data and test data. The reason there are different figures
for anaphora resolution and classification is that the system may correctly classify a
description as anaphoric, but then find the wrong antecedent. We used this set of
heuristics when evaluating the heuristics for discourse-new and bridging descriptions
in the rest of the paper.
The column headed # represents the number of cases of descriptions classified as
anaphora in the standard annotation; + indicates the total number of anaphora (clas-
sification and resolution) correctly identified; — indicates the total number of errors.

tics used by the system, we will discuss in more detail some of the errors in the
resolution of anaphoric descriptions made by using the heuristics just discussed.
Some errors are simply caused by misspellings in the Treebank, as in the example

Limiting the type of potential antecedents to indefinites, definite descriptions,

tecedents introduced by other NPs, such as proper names, are missed—e.g., Toni John-
son in (46). The following definite description is then classified by the system as larger

coordinated noun phrases. Although it would be relatively easy to add rules for han-
dling the simplest cases (possibly at the expense of a decrease in precision), many of
these references can only be resolved by means of nontrivial operations.

5.3 Identification of Discourse-New Descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972232210526316">
The overall recall and precision results for the heuristics for identifying discourse-
new descriptions presented in Section 4.2 are shown in Table 11. In this table we do
not distinguish between the two types of discourse-new descriptions, unfamiliar and
larger-situation (Hawkins 1978). As already mentioned in Section 4.2, distinguishing
between the two types of discourse-new descriptions identified by Hawkins, Prince,
and others isn&apos;t easy even for humans (Fraurud 1990; Poesio and Vieira 1998); and
indeed, our heuristics for recognizing discourse-new descriptions work better when
evaluated together. The column headed if represents the number of cases of descrip-
tions classified as discourse-new in the standard annotation; + indicates the total num-
ber of discourse-new descriptions correctly identified; — the number of errors. These
results are for the version of the system that uses the best version of the heuristics
for dealing with anaphoric descriptions discussed above, and that doesn&apos;t attempt to
resolve bridging descriptions (Version 1).
The performance of the specific heuristics discussed in Section 4.2 is shown in
Tables 12 to 15. Table 12 shows the results of the heuristics for larger situation uses
on the training data, whereas Table 13 reports the performance on the same data of

the heuristics for unfamiliar uses. We report only precision figures because our stan-
dard annotation only gives us information about the classification of these discourse
descriptions as discourse-new, not about the reason they were classified in a certain
way (larger situation or unfamiliar). The most common feature of discourse-new de-
scriptions is postmodification; the least satisfactory results are those for proper names
in premodification. As expected, the heuristics for recognizing unfamiliar uses (many
of which are licensed by linguistic knowledge) achieve better precision than those for
larger situation uses, which depend more on commonsense knowledge.
Tables 14 and 15 summarize the results of the heuristics for discourse-new de-
scriptions on the test data (Corpus 2). Again, the best results were obtained by the
heuristics for recognizing unfamiliar uses. The biggest difference in performance was
shown by the heuristic checking the presence of the definite in a copula construction,
which performed very well on the training data, but poorly on the test data. The actual
performance of that heuristic is difficult to evaluate, however, as a very low recall was
reported for both training and test data.
In the following sections, we analyze some of the problems encountered by the
version of the system using these heuristics.
Apposition. Coordinated NPs with more than two conjuncts are a problem for this
heuristic, since in the Penn Treebank L coordinated NPs have a structure that matches
the pattern used by the system for recognizing appositions. For example, the coordi-
nated NP in the sentence C-7 consists of the U.S., japan, Britain, West Germany, Canada,

Copula. This heuristic was difficult to evaluate because there few examples, and the
precision in the two data sets is very different (see Tables 13 and 15 above). One
problem is that the descriptions in copula constructions might also be interpreted
as bridging descriptions. For instance, the description the result in (52a) below is the
result of something mentioned previously, while the copula construction specifies its
referent. Other ambiguous examples are (52b) and (52c):
(52) a. The result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have
boosted their holdings substantially.
b. The chief culprits, he says, are big companies and business groups that
buy huge amounts of land not for their corporate use, but for resale at
huge profit.
c. The key man seems to be the campaign manager, Mr. Lynch.
Restrictive premodification. One problem with this heuristic is that although proper
nouns in premodifier positions are often used with discourse-new definites (e.g.,
the Iran-Iraq war), they may also be used as additional information in associative or
anaphoric uses:

As Ms. Johnson stands outside the Hammack house after winding up her

Restrictive postmodification. If the system fails to find an antecedent or anchor and the
description is postmodified, it may wrongly be classified as discourse-new. In (54) the
filing on the details of the spinoff was classified as bridging on documents filed . . by the

Proper nouns. As we have already seen—(46), repeated below as (55)--a definite de-
scription that looks like a proper noun (the petite, 29-year-old Ms. Johnson) may in fact
be anaphoric. This is not always a problem, as the system does attempt to find an-
tecedents for these definites, as well, but if the antecedent is not found (as in the
example below) the description is incorrectly classified as discourse-new.

5.4 Bridging Descriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999807789473684">
As mentioned in Section 2, our corpus annotation experiments showed bridging de-
scriptions to be the most difficult class for humans to agree on. Even when our anno-
tators agreed that a particular expression was a bridging description, different anchors
would be available in the text for the interpretation of that bridging description. This
makes the results of the system for this class very difficult to evaluate; furthermore,
the results must be evaluated by hand.
We first tested the heuristics individually on the training data (the same data
used in a previous analysis of the performance of our system on bridging descriptions
iVieira and Teufel 19971) by adding them to Version 1 of the system one at a time. These
separate tests were manually evaluated, We then integrated all of these heuristics into
a version of the system called Version 2, using both automatic and manual evaluation_
In this section we discuss only the results of the individual heuristics; the overall
results of Version 2 are discussed in Section 6.
Bridging descriptions are much more sensitive than other types of definite de-
scriptions to the local focus (Sidner 1979); for this reason, Version 2 uses a different
search strategy for bridging descriptions than for other definite descriptions. Rather
than considering all definite descriptions in the current window simultaneously, it goes
back one sentence at a time and stops as soon as a relation with a potential anchor is
found.

five sentences.&apos; The results of this search over our training corpus, in which 204
descriptions were classified as bridging, are shown in Table 16. It is interesting to
note that the semantic relations found in this automatic search were not always those
observed in our manual analysis.
The main reason the figures are so low is that the existence of a semantic relation
in WordNet is not a sufficient condition (nor a strong indication) to establish a link
between an antecedent and a bridging description. In only about a third of the cases
was a potential antecedent for which we could find a semantic relation in WordNet an
appropriate anchor. An example is (57): although there is a semantic relation between
argument and information in WordNet, the description the argument is related to the
VP contend rather than to the NP information. Some form of focusing seems to play a
crucial role in restricting the range of antecedents (see also the discussion in Hitzeman
and Poesio 119981).
(57) A SEC proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company
executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider
trades as a stock-picking tool, individual investors and professional
money managers contend.
They make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes
proposed this past summer that, among other things, would exempt
many middle-management executives from reporting trades in their own
companies&apos; shares.
Sense ambiguity is responsible for some of the false positives. For instance, the
noun company has at least two distinct senses: &amp;quot;visitor&amp;quot; (as in I have company) and &amp;quot;busi-
ness.&amp;quot; A relation of hypernyrny was found between company and human (its &amp;quot;visitor&amp;quot;
sense), whereas in the text the noun company was used in the &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; sense. A
more important problem, however, is the incompleteness of the information encoded
in WordNet. To have an idea of how complete the information in WordNet is con-
cerning the relations that are encoded, we selected from our two corpora 70 bridging
descriptions that we had manually identified as being linked to their anchors by one of
the semantic relations encoded in WordNet—synonymy, hypernymy (hyponymy), and
meronymy (holonymy). In Table 17 we show the percentages of such relations actually
encoded in WordNet. (The fourth column in the table indicates the cases in which the
expected relation is not encoded, but the two nouns are sisters in the hierarchy.)
As we can see from the table, the recall figure was quite disappointing, especially
for synonymy relations. In some cases, the problem was simply that some of the

An example of problematic organization in WordNet,
words we looked for were not in WordNet: examples include newsweekly (news-weekly),
crocidolite, countersuit (counter-suit). Other times, the word we looked for was contained
in WordNet, but not in the same typographic format as it was presented in the text;
for example we had spinoff in a text, whereas WordNet had only an entry for spin-
off. A second source of problems was the use in the WSJ articles of domain-specific
terminology with context-dependent senses, such as slump, crash, and bust, which in
articles about the economy are all synonyms. Finally, in other cases the relations were
missing due to the structure of WordNet: for instance, in WordNet the nouns room,
wall, and floor are encoded as part of building but not of house (see Figure 2).
In summary, our tests have shown that the knowledge encoded in WordNet is
not sufficient to interpret all semantic relations between a bridging description and
its antecedent found in the kind of text we are dealing with: only 46% of the rela-

automatically acquired lexical information for this purpose is being explored: see, for
example, Poesio, Schulte im Walde, and Brew (1998). In addition, we found that just
looking for the closest semantic relative is not enough to find anchors for bridging
descriptions; this search has to be constrained by some type of focusing mechanism,

was 95%. The errors we found were sometimes due to name or sense ambiguity. In
the same text a name may refer both to a person and a company, as in Cray Comput-
ers Corp. and Seymour Cray. When looking in WordNet for a type for the name Steve
Reich we found for the name Reich the type country. These problems have also been
noted by the authors of systems participating in MUC-6 (Appelt 1995). We also found
undesirable relations such as hyperrtymy for person and company.

We had 25 definite descriptions manually identified as based on compound nouns.
For these 25 cases, our implemented heuristics achieved a recall of 36% (9/25) but,
in some cases, found valid relations other than the ones we identified. The low recall
was sometimes due to segmentation. Sometimes the spelling of the premodification
was slightly different from the one of the description, as in a 15-acre plot . . . the 15 acres.

6. Overall Evaluation of the System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988785714286">
As mentioned above, we implemented two versions of the system. Version 1 only
resolves direct anaphora and identifies discourse-new descriptions; Version 2 also deals
with bridging descriptions. Both versions of the system have at their core a decision
tree in which the heuristics discussed in the previous sections are tried in a fixed order
to classify a certain definite description and find its anchor. Determining the optimal
order of application of the heuristics in the decision tree is crucial to the performance
of the system. In both versions of the system we used a decision tree developed by
hand on the basis of extensive evaluation; we also attempted to determine the order
of application automatically, by means of decision tree learning algorithms (Quinlan
1993).
In this section we first present the hand-crafted decision tree and the results ob-
tained using this decision tree for Version 1 and Version 2; we then present the results
concerning the agreement between system and annotators, and we briefly discuss the
results obtained using the decision tree acquired automatically.

30 By comparison, the systems participating in MUC-6 had a recall for the named entity task ranging
from 82% to 96%, and precision from 89% to 97%, but used comprehensive lists of cue words or
consulted dictionaries of names. The system from Sheffield (Gaizauskas et al. 1995), for instance, used a
list of 2,600 names of organizations, 94 company designators (Co., Ltd, PLC, etc.), 160 titles (Dr., Mr.,
etc.), about 500 human names from the Oxford Advanced Learner&apos;s Dictionary, 2,268 place names
(country, province, and city names), and other trigger words for locations, government institutions and
organizations (Coif, Mountain, Agency, Ministry, Airline, etc.). In MUC-7, the best combined precision
score, 93.39%, was achieved by the system from LTG in Edinburgh (Mikheev, IVIoens, and Grover 1999),
which doesn&apos;t use such knowledge sources. We used this system in a version of our prototype that
only attempts to resolve bridging descriptions (Ishikawa 1998).

c. Try to find an antecedent for the definite description among the
antecedents that are accessible according to combined loose
segmentation and recency, by matching head nouns and dealing
with premodification and postmodification (see Section 4.1 and
Section 5.2). If the system succeeds, the description is classified
as direct anaphora and the relation of coreference between the
two NP indexes is asserted.
d. Verify if the head of the NP is a proper noun (by checking
whether it is capitalized). If so, the description is classified as
discourse-new, larger situation use.
e. Check if the definite has a restrictive postmodifier. Definites that
are not anaphoric and have restrictive postmodifiers are
classified as discourse-new, unfamiliar uses.
f. Check if there is a proper noun in premodifier position; if so, the
definite description is classified as discourse-new, larger
situation use.
g. Check if the definite occurs in a copula construction. If so, the
description is classified as discourse-new, unfamiliar use.

The heuristics for recognizing bridging descriptions are only applied when the
other heuristics fail. This is because the performance of these heuristics is very poor
and also because some of the heuristics that deal with bridging descriptions are com-
putationally expensive; the idea was to eliminate those cases less likely to be bridg-
ing before applying these heuristics. The system does not classify all occurrences of
definite descriptions: when none of the tests succeeds, the definite description is not
classified. We observed in our first tests that definite descriptions not resolved as direct
anaphora and not identified as discourse-new by our heuristics were mostly classified
in the standardized annotation as bridging descriptions or discourse-new. Examples
of discourse-new descriptions not identified by our heuristics are larger situation uses

6.2 Results for Anaphora and Discourse-New Descriptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987017">
We present below the overall results of the version of our system dealing with direct
anaphora and discourse-new descriptions only (Version 1).
Training Data. The output of the optimal configuration of Version 11 for the training data
is shown in Figure 4. A total of 20 texts were processed, containing 6,8311 NPs. Almost
half of these NPs (2,911) were considered as potential antecedents; 1,040 descriptions
were processed by the system. An antecedent was identified for 270 of them; for 212
out of the 270 definite descriptions classified as anaphoric same-head by the system,
the antecedent was a definite NF. According to the annotation of one of our coders (not
the system&apos;s output), the 312 anaphoric descriptions were grouped in 164 coreference
chains and 86 of these chains were initiated by definite descriptions.
In Figure 5, the results reported by the system are compared with the standard
annotation. The figure also shows how descriptions which were not resolved by the
system were classified in the standard annotation. Most of the descriptions not classi-
fied by the system were bridging descriptions.
The overall precision and recall results of Version 1 of the system are shown in
Table 18. Note that because a large number of definite descriptions are not classified,
the overall recall is only 59%, even though the recall for both anaphoric and discourse-
new descriptions is much higher.
Test Data. Next, the system was evaluated using the test data, Corpus 2, which had
not been used to develop the heuristics. The results are shown in Figures 6 and 7.

The recall and precision figures for the system&apos;s performance over the test data are
presented in Table 19. This corpus consisted of 14 texts, containing 2,990 NPs. Again,
ah-nost half of the NPs were considered as potential antecedents. The system processed
464 definite descriptions; of these, the system could classify 324: 115 as direct anaphora,
209 as discourse-new. Of the antecedents, 88 were defirtites themselves. The system
incorrectly resolved 77 definite descriptions: 19 anaphoric definites and 58 discourse-
new. As before, there were just a few more errors in anaphora resolution than in
anaphora classification. The overall recall for the test data was 53% (247/464); precision
was 76% (247/324).
One difference between the results on the two data sets is the distribution into
classes of those descriptions that the system fails to classify. In the first corpus, the
largest number of cases not classified are bridging descriptions. By contrast, the largest
number of cases not classified by the system in Corpus 2 are discourse-new.

Training Data. The manual evaluation of the results of Version 2 on the training data
is presented in Table 20. The table lists the number of acceptable anchors and the
number of false positives found by each heuristic. Note that the system sometimes
finds anchors that are not those identified manually, but are nevertheless acceptable.
We found fewer bridging relations than the number we observed in the corpus
analysis (204); furthermore, the number of false positives produced by such heuristics
is almost twice the number of right answers.
Test Data. Version 2 was tested over the test data using automatic evaluation—i.e., the
system was only evaluated as a classifier, and the anchors found were not analyzed.
A total of 57 bridging relations were found, but only 19 of the definite descriptions
classified as bridges by the system had been classified as bridging descriptions in the
standard annotation. Compared to Version 1 of the system, which does not resolve
bridging descriptions, Version 2 has higher recall but lower precision, as shown in
Table 21.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998585769230769">
As a second form of evaluation of the performance of the system, we measured its
agreement with the annotators on the test data using the K statistic.
Version 1 of the system finds a classification for 318 out of 464 definite descrip-
tions in Corpus 2 (the test data). If all the definite descriptions that the system cannot
classify are treated as discourse-new, the agreement between the system and the three
subjects that annotated this corpus on the two classes first-mention (= discourse-old)
and subsequent-mention (= discourse-new or bridges) is K = 0.7; this should be com-
pared with an agreement of K = 0.77 between the three annotators themselves. If,
instead of counting these definite descriptions as discourse-new, we simply do not
include them in our measure of agreement, then the agreement between the system
and the annotators is K = 0.78, as opposed to K = 0.81 between the annotators. (Notice
that the fact that the agreement between annotators goes up, as well, indicates that
the definite descriptions that the system can&apos;t handle are &amp;quot;harder&amp;quot; than the rest.)

Version 2 finds a classification for 355 out of 464 definite descriptions; however,
its agreement figures are worse. If we count the cases that the system can&apos;t classify
as discourse-new, the agreement between the system and the three annotators for the
three classes is K = 0.57; if we count them as bridges, K = 0.63; if we just discard those
cases, K = 0.63 again. (By comparison, the agreement among annotators on the three
classes was K = 0.68 overall and K = 0.70 on just the cases that the system was able
to classify.) As mentioned above, the cases that the system can&apos;t handle are mainly
discourse-new descriptions (see Figure 7).

6.5 Deriving the Order of Application of the Heuristics Automatically
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993374666666667">
6.5.1 Inducing a Decision Tree. The decision tree discussed in Section 6.1 was derived
manually, by trial and error. We also tried to derive the order of application of the
heuristics automatically. To do this, we used a modified version of the system to
assign Boolean feature values to each definite description in the training corpus (i.e.,
the system checked if the features applied to a definite description instance or not).
The following features were used:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998933181818182">
1. Special predicates (Spec-Pred): this feature has the value yes if a special
predicate occurs in the definite description (as specified in Section 4.2),
and if a complement is there when needed.
2. Direct anaphora (Dir-Ana): this feature has the value yes if the system
can find an antecedent with a same-head noun for that description
(respecting the constraints discussed in Section 4.1).
3. Apposition (Appos): yes when the description is in appositive
construction.
4. Proper noun (PropN): yes when the description has a capitalized initial.
5. Restrictive postmodification (RPostm): yes if the definite description is
modified by relative or associative clauses.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97630985">
This list of features, together with the classification assigned to each description in
the standard annotation (DDUse), was used to train an implementation of Quinlan&apos;s
learning algorithm ID3 (Quinlan 1993). We excluded the verification of restrictive pre-
modification and copula constructions, since these parameters had given the poorest
results before (see Section 6.2). An example of the samples used to train ID3 is shown
in (58).
(58) Spec-Pred Dir-Ana Appos PropN RPostm DDUse
RO no no yes no 3
no no RO RO yes 3
no no no no no 2
no no no no no 2
no no no no no 1
no yes no no no 1
The algorithm generates a decision tree on the basis of the samples given. The resulting
decision tree is presented in Figure 8.
The main difference between this algorithm and the algorithm we arrived at by
hand is that the first feature checked by the decision tree generated by 1D3 is the
presence of an antecedent with a same-head noun. The presence of special predicates,
which we adopted as the first test in our decision tree, is only the fourth test in the
tree in Figure 8.

the learned decision tree was compared with that of the algorithm we arrived at by
trial and error as follows: The first 14 texts of Corpus 1 (845 descriptions) were used
as training data to generate the decision tree. We then tested the learned algorithm
over the other 6 texts of that corpus (195 instances of definite descriptions).
Two different tests were undertaken:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990056">
• first, we gave as input to the learning algorithm all cases classified as
direct anaphora, discourse-new, or bridging, 818 in total (this test
produces the decision tree presented in the previous section);
• in a second test, the algorithm was trained only with direct anaphora
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993011692307692">
and discourse-new descriptions (639 descriptions); all cases classified as
bridging, idiom, or doubt in the standard annotation were not given as
input in the learning process. This algorithm was then only able to
classify descriptions as one of those two classes. The resulting decision
tree classifies descriptions with a same-head antecedent as anaphoric; all
the rest as discourse-new.
Here we present the results evaluated all together, considering the system as a
classifier only, i.e., without considering the tasks of anaphora resolution and of identi-
fication of discourse-new descriptions separately. The output produced by the learned
algorithm is compared to the standard annotation. Since the learned algorithm classi-
fies all cases, the number of responses is equal to the number of cases, as a consequence,
recall is the same as precision, and so is the F measure.
The tests over 6 texts with 195 definite descriptions gave the following results:
</bodyText>

The best results were achieved by the algorithm trained for two classes only.
This is not surprising, especially considering how difficult it was for our subjects to
distinguish between discourse-new and bridging descriptions.
The hand-crafted decision tree (Version 2) achieved 62% recall and 85% precision
(F = 71.70%) on those same texts: i.e., a higher precision, but a lower F measure, due
to a lower recall, since—unlike the learned algorithm—it does not classify all instances
of definite descriptions. If, however, we take the class discourse-new as a default for
all cases of definite descriptions not resolved by the system, recall, precision, and F
value go to 77%, slightly higher than the rates achieved by the decision tree produced
by ID3.
As the learned decision tree has the search for a same-head antecedent as the first
test, we modified our algorithm to work in the same way, and tested it again with the
two corpora. The results with this configuration were:

In other words, the results were about the same, although a slightly better performance

7. Other Computational Models of Definite Description Processing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962666666667">
A major difference between our proposal and almost all others (theoretical and im-
plemented) is that we concentrate on definite descriptions; most of the systems we
discuss below attempt to resolve all types of anaphoric expressions, often concentrat-
ing on pronouns. Focusing on definite descriptions allowed us to investigate what
types of lexical knowledge and commonsense inference are actually used in natural
language comprehension.
From an architectural standpoint, the main difference between our work and other
proposals in the literature is that we paid considerably more attention to the problem
of identifying discourse-new definite descriptions.&apos;
Previous work on computational methods for definite description resolution can
be divided in two camps: proposals that rely on commonsense reasoning (and are
therefore either mainly theoretical or domain dependent), and systems that can be
quantitatively evaluated, such as those competing on the coreference task in the Sixth
and Seventh Message Understanding Conference (Sundheim 1995). We discuss these
two types of work in turn.

The crucial characteristic of these proposals is that they exploit hand-coded common-
sense knowledge, and cannot therefore be tested on just any arbitrary text. Some of
them are simply tested on texts that were especially built for the purpose of testing
the system (Carter 1987; Carbonell and Brown 1988); systems like the Core Language
Engine are more robust, but they have to be applied to a domain restricted enough
that all relevant knowledge can be encoded by hand.

Vieira and Poesio Processing Definite Descriptions
Sidner&apos;s Theory of Definite Anaphora Cornprehension. In her dissertation, Sidner (1979)
proposed a complete theory of definite NP resolution, including detailed algorithms
for resolving pronouns, anaphoric definite descriptions, and bridging descriptions. She
also proposed methods for resolving larger situation uses; the one class her methods
do not handle are those definite descriptions that, following Hawkins, we have called
unfamiliar uses.
The main contribution of Sidner&apos;s dissertation is her theory of focus and its role
in resolving definite NPs; to this day, her focus-tracking algorithms are arguably the
most detailed account of the phenomenon. The main problem with Sidner&apos;s work from
our perspective is that her algorithms rely heavily on the availability of a semantic
network and causal reasoner; furthermore, some of the inference mechanisms are left
relatively underspecified (this latter problem was in part corrected in subsequent work
by Carter—see below). Lexical and commonsense knowledge play three important
roles in Sidner&apos;s system: they are used to track focus, to resolve bridging descriptions
and larger situation uses, and to evaluate interpretive hypotheses, discarding those
that seem implausible. Only recently have robust knowledge-based methods for some
of these tasks begun to appear, and their performance is still not very good, as seen
above in our discussion of using WordNet as a semantic network;33 as for checking
the plausibility of a hypothesis on the basis of causal knowledge about the world, we
now have a much better theoretical grasp of how such inferences could be made (see,
for example, Hobbs et al. [1993] and Lascarides and Asher [1993]), but we are still
quite a long way from a general inference engine.
We also found that some of Sidner&apos;s resolution rules are too restrictive. For ex-
ample, her Cospecification rule 1 prescribes that definite description and focus must
have the same head, and no new information can be introduced by the definite; but
this rule is violated fairly frequently in our corpus. This criticism is not new: In 1983,
it was already recognized that an anaphoric full noun phrase may include some new
and unshared information about a previously mentioned entity (Grosz, Joshi, and We-
instein 1983), and Carter (1987) weakened some of the restrictions proposed by Sidner
in his system.
Carter&apos;s Shallow Processing Anaphor Resolver. Carter (1987) implemented a modified ver-
sion of Sidner&apos;s algorithm and integrated it with an implemented version of Wilks&apos;
theory of commonsense reasoning. This work is interesting for two reasons: first of all,
because Carter, unlike Sidner, attempted to evaluate the performance of his system; and
because, in doing so, he addressed the commonsense reasoning problem in some detail.
Carter&apos;s system, SPAR, is based on the Shallow Processing Hypothesis: that in re-
solving anaphors, reasoning should be avoided as much as possible. This is, of course,
the same approach taken in our own work, which could be seen as pushing Carter&apos;s ap-
proach to the extreme. The difference is that when it becomes necessary, SPAR does use
Iwo commonsense knowledge sources: a semantic network based on Alshawi&apos;s theory
of memory for text interpretation (Alshawi 1987) and a causal reasoner based on Wilks&apos;
work (Wilks 1975). In both cases, the necessary information was encoded by hand.
Carter&apos;s system was tested over short stories specifically designed for the testing
of the system: about 40 written by Carter himself, and 23 written by others. These
latter contain about 80 definite descriptions. SPAR correctly resolved all anaphors in
the stories written by Carter, and 66 out of 80 of the descriptions in the 23 other stories.

(Carter himself points out that these results are &amp;quot;of limited significance because of the
simplicity of the texts processed compared to &apos;real&apos; texts&amp;quot; [p. 238].)
The Core Language Engine. The Core Language Engine (CLE) (Alshawi 1992) is a domain-
independent system developed at SRI Cambridge, which translates English sentences
into formal representations. The system was used by SRI for a variety of applications,
including spoken language translation and airline reservations. The CLE makes use of
a core lexicon (to which new entries can be added) and uses an abductive common-
sense reasoner to produce an interpretation and to verify the plausibility of choice of
referents from an ordered list; the required world knowledge has to be added by hand
for each domain, together with whatever lexical knowledge is needed.
The construction of the formal representation goes through art intermediate stage
called quasi-logical form (QLF). The QLF may contain unresolved terms correspond-
ing to anaphoric NPs including, among others, definite descriptions. The resolution
process that transforms QLFs into resolved logical form representations of sentences is
described in Alshawi (1990). Definite descriptions are represented as quantified terms.
The referential readings of definite descriptions are handled by proposing referents
from the external application context (larger situation uses) as well as the CLE context
model (anaphoric uses). Attributive readings may also be proposed during QLF reso-
lution; some of these seem to correspond to our unfamiliar uses. Thus, the CLE seems
to account for discourse-new descriptions, although they are not explicitly mentioned,
and the methods used for choosing a referential or an attributive interpretation are
not discussed. To our knowledge, no analysis of the performance of the system has
been published.

7.2 The Systems Involved in the MUC-6 Coreference Task
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998716">
The seven systems that participated in the MUC-6 competition can all be quantitatively
evaluated; they achieved recall scores ranging from 35.69% to 62.78% and precision
scores ranging from 4-4.23% to 71.88% on nominal coreference.
It is important to note that the evaluation in MUC-6 differed from ours in three
important aspects. First of all, these systems have to parse the texts, which often in-
troduces errors; furthermore, these systems often cannot get complete parses for the
sentences they are processing. Secondly, the evaluation in MUC-6 considers the coref-
erential chain as a whole, and not only one correct antecedent. The third difference is
that these systems process a wider range of referring expressions, including pronouns
and bare nouns, while our system only processes definite NPs. On the other hand, not
all definite descriptions are marked in the ML1C-6 coreference task: these systems are
only required to identify identity relations, and only if the antecedent was introduced
by a noun phrase (not if it was a clause or a conjoined NP). This leaves out discourse-
new descriptions and, especially, bridging descriptions, which, as we have seen, are
by far the most difficult cases.
Kameyarna (1997) analyzes in detail the coreference module of the SRI system
that participated in MUC-6 (Appelt et al. 1995). This system achieved one of the top
scores for the coreference task: a recall of 59% and a precision of 72%. The SRI system
uses a sort hierarchy claimed to be sparse and incomplete. For definite descriptions,
Kameyama reports the results of a test on five articles, containing 61 definite descrip-
tions in total; recall was 46% (28/61), and for proper names, 69% (22/32). The precision
figures for these two subclasses are not reported. Some of the errors in definite de-
scriptions are said to be due to nonidentity referential relations; however, there is no
mention of differences between discourse-new and bridging descriptions. Other errors
were said to be related to failure in recognizing synonyms.

7.3 Probabilistic Methods in Anaphora Resolution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969176470588">
Aone and Bennet (1995) propose an automatically trainable anaphora resolution sys-
tem. They train a decision tree using the C 4.5 algorithm by feeding feature vectors
for pairs of anaphor and antecedent. They use 66 features, including lexical, syntac-
tic, semantic, and positional features. Their overall recall and precision figures are
66.56% and 72.18%. Considering only definite NPs whose referent is an organization
(that is the only distinction available in their report), recall is 35.19% and precision
50% (measured on 54 instances). Their training and test texts were newspaper articles
about joint ventures, and they claim that because each article always talked about
more than one organization, finding the antecedents of organizational anaphora was
not straightforward.
In Burger and Connolly (1992) a Bayesian network is used to resolve anaphora
by probabilistically combining linguistic evidence. Their sources of evidence are c-
command (syntactic constraints), semantic agreement (gender, person, and number
plus a term subsumption hierarchy), discourse focus, discourse structure, recency, and
centering. Their methods are described and exemplified but not evaluated. A Bayesian
framework is also proposed by Cho and Maida (1992) for the identification of definite
descriptions&apos; referents.

8.1 Contributions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963379310345">
We have presented a domain-independent system for definite description interpreta-
tion whose development was based on an empirical study of definite description use
that included multiannotator experiments. Our system not only attempts to find an
antecedent for a definite description, it also uses methods for recognizing discourse-
new descriptions, which our previous studies revealed to be the largest class of def-
inite descriptions in our corpus. Our algorithms for segmentation, matching, and
identification of discourse-new descriptions only rely on syntax-based heuristics and
on on-line lexical sources such as WordNet; the final configuration of these heuris-
tics, as well as their order of application, was arrived at on the basis of extensive
experiments using our training corpus. Because our system only relies on &amp;quot;shal-
low&amp;quot; information, it encounters problems when commonsense reasoning is actually
needed; on the other hand, it cart be tested on any domain without extensive hand-
coding.
As far as direct anaphora is concerned, we evaluated heuristic algorithms for
segmentation and matching. Our system achieved 62% recall and 83% precision for
direct anaphora resolution on our test data. For identifying discourse-new descriptions,
we exploited the correlation between certain types of syntactic constructions and type
of use noted by Hawkins (1978) and semantically explained by Lobner (1987). Our
system achieved 69% recall and 72% precision for this class on the test data. Overall,
the version of the system that only attempts to recognize first-mention and subsequent-
mention definite descriptions achieved a recall of 53% and a precision of 76% on the
test corpus if we count the definite descriptions the system can&apos;t handle as errors; if
we count them as discourse-new, both recall and precision are 66%.
The class of bridging descriptions is the most difficult to process: this is in part
because humans themselves do not agree much on which definites count as bridges
and what their anchors are, in part because lexical knowledge and commonsense
reasoning are necessary to solve them. Our results for this class are, therefore, still
very tentative; this did not much affect the performance of the system, however, since
in the texts we tried, bridging descriptions are a relatively small class. Noncoreferent

bridging descriptions were around 8% of the definite descriptions in the corpus, and
the class of bridging descriptions including those with a coreferent antecedent with
a different head noun were about 15% of the total. We tried techniques that do not
involve heavy axiomatization of commonsense knowledge, and only used an existing
lexical source, WordNet.
In other text genres the distribution of definite descriptions into classes might
change; spoken dialogue, for example, tends to have a higher number of deictic def-
inite descriptions. However, other researchers (Fraurud 1990) found a similar distri-
bution of first-mention and subsequent-mention definites in text corpora; we believe
therefore that the heuristics we propose here, and their ordering, will still be ade-
quate. Direct anaphora and discourse-new descriptions can be processed with much
simpler methods and it seems that the distinguishing features do not usually over-
lap.

8.2 What&apos;s Needed Next?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999742777777778">
We would like to emphasize again that we are not trying to suggest that shallow
methods will be sufficient for processing definite descriptions in the long run. What
we do believe is that hypotheses about processing should be evaluated; unfortunately,
only fairly simple techniques can be tested in this way at the moment, but this work
can serve to motivate more clearly the use of more complex methods.
We highlighted throughout the paper, and particularly in Section 5, some of the
points where shallow methods break down, and better lexical sources or commonsense
knowledge are needed. By far the worse results are obtained for bridging descriptions;
in this area, the most urgent needs are better sources of lexical knowledge,&apos; and some
robust focusing mechanism. Finding better ways of segmenting the text is perhaps the
area in which the most progress has been made since we started this project; robust
methods for text segmentation are now available (Hearst 1997; Richmond, Smith, and
Amitay 1997). A proper treatment of modification seems harder; as discussed in Sec-
tion 4.1, it seems necessary to rely heavily on reasoning in some cases. In order to
improve our treatment of discourse-new descriptions it will be necessary, on the one
hand, to find ways of automatically acquiring lexical information about the function-
ality of nouns and adjectives, and on the other hand, to have sources of encyclopedic
knowledge available.

8.3.1 Simple Extensions. In this project we were more interested in clearly identify-
ing the subtasks of the definite description process that in achieving optimum per-
formance; as a consequence, there are a number of fairly simple ways in which the
final version of the system could be improved. The next step in making our system
truly testable on any type of text would be to make it work off the output of a robust
parser: we are currently testing Abney&apos;s CASS parser (Abney 1991) for this purpose.
See Ishikawa (1998), for some initial results. We are also experimenting with existing
software that performs in a more sophisticated way some of the tasks that our system
currently implements in a fairly crude fashion, including lemmatization, proper name
recognition, and named entity typing.
Another aspect of the system that deserves further examination is the construction
of coreference chains and cases of multiple resolutions. We did not get a clear picture
