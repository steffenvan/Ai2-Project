ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985625">
To account for the semi-free word order of French,
Unification Categorial Grammar is extended in two
ways. First, verbal valencies are contained in a set
rather than in a list. Second, type-raised NP&apos;s are
described as two-sided functors. The new framework
does not overgenerate i.e., it accepts all and only the
sentences which are grammatical. This follows partly
from the elimination of false lexical ambiguities — i.e.,
ambiguities introduced in order to account for all the
possible positions a word can be in within a sentence —
and partly from a system of features constraining the
possible combinations.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.874298933333334">
In the version of categorial grammar (henceforth,
CG) developed by Bar-Hillel (Bar-Hillel 1953), cate-
gories encode both constituency and linear prece-
dence. Linear precedence is encoded by (a) ordering
valencies in a list and (b) using directional slashes
indicating whether the argument is to be found to the
left or to the right of the functor.
A similar approach is adopted in Unification Cate-
gorial Grammar (UCG) (Zeevat, Klein and Calder
1987) as regards word order whereby the directional
slash is replaced by a binary Order feature with value
pre or post. Thus, S/NPVP in normal CO translates as
S/NP:pre/NP:post in UCG, wherepre indicates that the
functor must precede the argument and post that it
should follow it.
Our work on French syntax supports the claim that
the complicated pattern of French linearity phenomena
can be treated in a framework closely related to UCG
but which departs from it in two ways. First, there is no
rigid assignment of an order value (pre or post) to verb
valencies. Second, following (Gunji 1986) verbal va-
lencies are viewed as forming a set rather than a list. As

a result, the syntactic behaviour of constituents is
dissociated from surface ordering. Constraints on
word order are described by a system of features as
advocated in (Uszkoreit 1987) and (ICarttunen 1986).

<bodyText confidence="0.999885">
In UCG, the phonological, categorial, semantic and
order information associated with a word is contained
in a single grammar structure called a sign. This can be
represented as follows.

where colons separate the different fields of the sign.
We need not concern ourselves here with the Se-
mantics and the Phonology fields of the sign. More
interesting for our purpose are the Category and the
Order attributes. Following the categorial tradition,
categories can be basic or complex. Basic categories
are of the form Head/Features where Head is one of
the atomic symbols n(oun), np or s(entence) and Fea-
tures is a list of feature values. Complex categories are
of the form CISign, where C is either atomic or com-
plex and Sign is asign, so that departing from traditio-
nal CG&apos; s, a functor places constraints on the whole sign
of the argument rather than on its syntactic category
only. The part of a complex category which omits the
Head/Features information constitutes the active part
of the sign. The first accessible sign in the active part
is called the active sign, the idea being that e.g. verb
valencies are ordered in a list so that each time a
valency is consumed, the next sign in the active part be-
comes the new active sign. The Order attribute places
constraints on the combination rule that may apply to
a functor : pre on an argument sign Y indicates that the
functor X/Y must precede the argument, while post
indicates that the functor must follow the argument.

Using terms and term unification, the forward version&apos;
of functional application can then be stated as follows.

were upper letters indicate Prolog variables. In effect,
the rule requires that the active part of the functor sign
term unifies with the argument sign. The Result is a
sign identical to the functor sign, but where the com-
plex category is stripped from its active part and where
variables shared by the active part of the functor and the
rest of the functor sign may have become ground as a
result of the active part unifying with the argument.
The resulting phonology consists of the phonology of
the functor followed by the phonology of the argument.

2. LINGUISTIC OBSERVATIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995868090909091">
Word order in French is characterised by three main
facts. First, the positioning - left or right- of a particular
argument with respect to the verb is relatively free. As
L Backward application is just the symmetric of (2) where the
argument precedes the functor and pre becomes post.
illustrated in (4), the subject can appear to the left (4a)
or to the right (4b,c) of the verb, or between the
auxiliary and the verb (4d), depending on the morpho-
logical class of the NP and on the type of the sentence
(declarative, subject-auxiliary inversion, wh-question,
etc).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.935566384615385">
(4) (a) Jacques aime Marie.
(b) Aime-t-i/ Marie?
(c) Quel livre aime Jacques?
(d) A-t-i/ aime Marie?
All other arguments can also appear to the left or to
the right of the verb under similar conditions. For
example, a lexical non-nominative NP can never be to
the left of the verb, but clitics and wh-constituents can.
(5) (a) *Marie a regard6e Jacques?
(with Marie = Obj)
(b) Quelle revue a regard&amp; Jacques?
(with Quelle revue = Obj)
(c) Jacques l&apos; a regard6e
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999558">
Second, there seems to be no clear regularities go-
verning the relative ordering of a sequence of argu-
ments. That is, assuming that only adjacent consti-
tuents may combine and taking the combinations left-
to-right, the combination pattern varies as indicated
below of each example in (6). Here again, the permis-
sible distributions are influenced by factors such as the
morphological class of the constituents and the verb
mood.

(d) Se le donne-t-il ?
[IObj,Obj,S ubj]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.968690666666667">
Third, coocurrence restrictions hold between cons-
tituents. For example, clitics constrain the positioning
and the class of other arguments as illustrated in (7)2
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9993544">

Since the ordering and the positioning of verb
arguments in French are very flexible, the rigid orcle-

ring forced by the UCG active list and the fixed
positioning resulting from the Order attribute are ra-
ther inadequate. On the other hand, word order in
French is not free either. Rather it seems to be governed
by conditional ordering statements such as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.936077">
(8) IF (a) the verb has an object valency, and
(b) the object NP is a wh-constituent, and
(c) the verbal constituent is the simple inflected
verb, and
(d) the clitic has not been incorporated
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997983125">
THEN the object can be placed to the left or to the
right of the verb.
If say, (8d) is not fulfilled, the wh-NP can be placed
only to the left, witness: *Jacques a-t-il regarde quelle
revue ?, and mutatis mutandis for the other conditions.
More generally, five elements can be isolated whose
interaction determine whether or not a given argument
can occupy a given position in the sentence.

to express the above conditioning variables. The resul-

To account for the facts presented in section 2,
UCG has been modified in two ways. Firstly, the active
part of a verb category is represented as a set rather than
a list. Secondly, a feature system is introduced which
embodies the interactions of the different elements

lity indicates whether the argument is optional or
obligatory&apos;. The Category attribute differs from UCG
in that (i) there are no Features associated with the
Head and (ii) the active part of a verb is viewed as a set
rather than as a list.
The Features attribute is a list of features. In this
paper, only those relevant to order constraints are
mentioned. They are: case, verb mood, morphological
class of NP&apos;s (i.e., lexical, clitic or wh-constituent)
and last concatenation to the left (Lastleft) or to the
right (Lastright). The latter features indicate the mor-
phological status of the last concatened functor and are
updated by the combination rule (cf. (13)). For ins-
tance, the sign associated with Jean lui a donne unlivre
will have lex as values for Lastleft and Lastright
whereas /ui a donne un livre has /ui and lex respective-
ly. The F eatures attribute can be represented as in (11)

As illustrated in (12), the Order attribute has two
parts, one for when the functor combines forward, the
other for when it combines backward.
(12) The Order attribute
Cdts pre = Resfeat,
Cdts = post = Resfeat,
where Cdts and Resfeat are lists of feature values
whose order and content are independent from those of
the Features attribute. The intuition behind this is that
functors (i.e., type-raised NP&apos;s) are two-sided i.e., they
can combine to the left and to the right but under
different conditions and with different results. The
features in Cdts place constraints on the features of the
argument while the features in Resfeat are inherited by
the resulting sign. These effects are obtained by unifi-

The rule requires (i) that the functor category El
combines with the argument category 121 to yield the
result category Category&apos;. The notion of combination
relies on the idea that the active part of a verb is a set
rather than a list. More precisely, given a type-raised
NP NP1 with category C/(C/NPi) where NPi is a
valency sign, and a verb V1 with category slActSet
where ActSet is a set of valency signs, NP1 combines
with Vi to yield V2 iff NPi unifies with some NP-valen-
cy sign in the active set ActSet of the verb. V2 is
identical to V1 except that the unifying NPi valency
sign has been removed from the active set and that
some features in V1 will have been instantiated by the
rule. Forward combination further requires (ii) that the
two features in the condition list to pre unify with the
Lastleft and Vmood features of the argument (the fea-
tures conditioning post are ignored since they are rele-
vant only when the functor combines backwards), and
(iii) that the features of the resulting sign be as speci-
fied. Note in particular that the MClass of the resulting
sign is the MClass of the argument, that Lastright
which indicates the morphological class of the last sign
to have combined with the verb from the right, is trans-
mitted from the argument, and that Lastleft is assigned
as value the MClass of the functor. Features of the re-
sulting sign which are conditional on the combination
order are inherited from the Resfeat field. This perco-

lation of features by rule is crucial to our treatment of
word order. It is illustrated by (14) below where the
sign Si associated with the clitic le combines with the
sign for S2 regarde to yield a new sign S3 le regarde.

When le is used as a forward functor, the conditions
on pre require that the argument i.e., the verb bears for
the feature Lastleft the value lui or i where i stands for
initial state thus requiring that the verb has not combi-
ned with anything on the left. When it combines by BC,
the conditions on post ensure that the argument has not
combined with anything on its right and that it has
mood imperative. In this way, all sentences in (15) are
parsed appropriately.

The backward combination rule (BC) functions
like FC except for two things. First, the argument must
be to the left of the functor and second, the condition
field considered is that of post rather than of pre. There
is also a deletion rule to eliminate optional valencies.

3.2 EXPRESSING THE VARIABLES UNDER-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985912555555556">
In our grammar, there are no post and pre primitive
values associated with specific verb valencies. Instead,
features interact with combination rules to enforce the
- 252 -
constraints on word order described in (9). (9a) is
captured in the two-sided order field. (9b - verb mood)
and (9c - morphological class of preceding concatena-
ting functor) are accounted for in that in a functor, the
features conditioning order include the verb mood and
the last concatenation attribute.
(9d) is accounted for in that conditions which are
invariant for a particular class of constituent (clitic,
wh-constituent, lexical NP) are expressed in the Order
field of these constituents. For example, wh-consti-
tuents reject through their conditions topre a wh-value
for the Lastleft feature of the argument and an inv16
value in their condition to post. As a result, the follo-
wing sentences are parsed appropriately.

Conditions which vary depending on the class of
the concatenating constituent are expressed in the
Features attribute of the verb valencies. This allows us
to express constraints on the position of a given type of
NP (lex, wh or clitic) relative to the valency it consu-
mes. For instance, a lexical NP can be subject or object.
If it is subject and it is to the left of the verb, it cannot
be immediately followed by a wh-constituent. If it is
subject and it is placed to the right of the verb, it must
be immediately adjacent to it. These constraints can be
stated using unification along to the following lines.
A verb valency is of the form
(17) (np:[... X,Y ...] :Ord)
where X and Y are either the anonymous variable or a
constant. They state constraints, among others, on
possible values ofLastleftandLastright features of the
verb. Recall that a valency is a sign which is a member
of a set in the Category attribute of a verbal sign.
The active sign of a type raised NP is of the form:
(18) C/(np:[... V1, V2...]:_)
:[vb Ii
:([V1 ...] =&gt; pre =&gt; Z, [V2 ...] =&gt; post =&gt; W)
By rule, V1 and V2 in the Category attribute of (18)
must unify with X and Y, respectively, in the verb
valency (17). Being shared variables, they transmit the
information to the Conditions on concatenation by FC
(pre) and BC (post), respectively.
Furthermore, V1 and V2 in the Ord attribute of the
functor must unify, by rule, with some specified featu-
res in the verb Features attribute represented in (19).

5. COVERAGE AND DISCUSSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982452380952">
The current grammar accounts for the core local li-
nearity phenomena of French i.e., auxiliary and clitic
order, clitic placement in simple and in complex verb
phrases, elide doubling and interrogative inversions.
Unbounded dependencies are catered for without re-
sorting either to threading (UCG), functional uncer-
tainty (Karttunen) or functional composition (Combi-
natory Categorial Grammar, Steedman 1986). Instead,
the issue is dealt with at the lexical level by introducing
an embedding valency on matrix verbs. Finally, non
local order constraints such as constraints on the distri-
bution of negative particles and the requirement for a
wh-constituent to be placed to the left of the verb when
a lexical subject is placed to the right (see example
(22d)) can also be handled.
Thus, it appears that insights from phrase structure
and categorial grammar can be fruitfully put together
in a lexical framework. Following GPSG, our forma-
lism does not associate verb valencies with any intrin-
sic order. An interesting difference however is that LP
statements are not used either. This is important since
in French, clitic ordering (Bes 1988) shows that order
constraints may hold between items belonging to dif-
ferent local trees. Another difference with GPSG is that
as in UCG, no explicit statement of feature instantia-
tion principles is required: the feature flow of informa-
tion is ensured by the concatenation rules. Last but not
least, it is worth underlining that our approach (1)
keeps the number of combination rules down to 2 (plus
a unary deletion rule) and (2) eliminates unjustified
lexical ambiguity i.e., ambiguity not related to catego-
rial or semantic information on the other hand.
Though there are - or so we argue - good linguistic
reasons for representing verb valencies as a set rather
than as a list, it is only fair to stress that this rapidly
leads to computational innefficiency while parsing.
Typically, given 3 adjacent signs NP1 V NP2 there will
be two ways of combining each NP with the verb and
thus two parses. In a more complex sentence, so-called
&amp;quot;spurious ambiguities&amp;quot; - i.e., analyses which yield

INTRODUCTION In the version of categorial grammar (henceforth, CG) developed by Bar-Hillel (Bar-Hillel 1953), categories encode both constituency and linear precedence. Linear precedence is encoded by (a) ordering valencies in a list and (b) using directional slashes indicating whether the argument is to be found to the left or to the right of the functor. A similar approach is adopted in Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG) (Zeevat, Klein and Calder 1987) as regards word order whereby the directional slash is replaced by a binary Order feature with value pre or post. Thus, S/NPVP in normal CO translates as S/NP:pre/NP:post in UCG, wherepre indicates that the functor must precede the argument and po</context>

EXTENSIONS TO UCG To account for the facts presented in section 2, UCG has been modified in two ways. Firstly, the active part of a verb category is represented as a set rather than a list. Secondly, a feature system is introduced which embodies the interactions of the different elements conditioning word order as described in (9) above. 3.1 SIGN STRUCTURE AND COMBINATION RULE: FROM AN ACTIVE LIST TO AN ACTIVE SET. To accomodate our analysis, the sign structure and the combination rule had to be slightly modified. In the French Grammar (FG), a sign is as follows. IA jump rule as used in (Baschung et al. 1986), is of the form X/Y, Y/Z =&gt; X/Z. (10) French Grammar Sign Phonology : Category : Features : Semantics : Optionality : Order Semantics and Phonology areas in UCG. Optionality indicates whether the argument is optional or obligatory&apos;. The Category attribute differs from UCG in that (i) there are no Features associated with the Head and (ii) the active part of a verb is viewed as a set rather than as a list. The Features attribute is a list of features. In this paper, only those relevant to order constraints are mentioned. They are: case, verb mood, morphological class of NP&apos;s (i.e., lexical, cl</context>

Thus, it appears that insights from phrase structure and categorial grammar can be fruitfully put together in a lexical framework. Following GPSG, our formalism does not associate verb valencies with any intrinsic order. An interesting difference however is that LP statements are not used either. This is important since in French, clitic ordering (Bes 1988) shows that order constraints may hold between items belonging to different local trees. Another difference with GPSG is that as in UCG, no explicit statement of feature instantiation principles is required: the feature flow of information is ensured by the concatenation rules. Last but not least, it is worth underlining that our approach (1) keeps the number of combination rules down to 2 (plus a unary deletion rule) and (2) eliminates unjustified lexical ambiguity i.e., ambiguity not related to categorial or semantic information on the other hand.

The system runs on a Sun and has been extensively tested. 5. COVERAGE AND DISCUSSION The current grammar accounts for the core local linearity phenomena of French i.e., auxiliary and clitic order, clitic placement in simple and in complex verb phrases, elide doubling and interrogative inversions. Unbounded dependencies are catered for without resorting either to threading (UCG), functional uncertainty (Karttunen) or functional composition (Combinatory Categorial Grammar, Steedman 1986). Instead, the issue is dealt with at the lexical level by introducing an embedding valency on matrix verbs. Finally, non local order constraints such as constraints on the distribution of negative particles and the requirement for a wh-constituent to be placed to the left of the verb when a lexical subject is placed to the right (see example (22d)) can also be handled. Thus, it appears that insights from phrase structure and categorial grammar can be fruitfully put together in a lexical framework.
