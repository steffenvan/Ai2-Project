I am particularly happy to have this opportunity to welcome the participants at this meeting
on behalf of all those in Pisa who are working in the field of computational linguistics and, in
particular, on behalf of my colleagues at the Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale of the Italian
National Research Council (CNR) and of the Dipartimento di Linguistica of the University of Pisa.
I am indeed delighted that the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics
has accepted the proposal that I made in Prague to organize its first meeting in Pisa.
As a member of the Program Committee, I have already had an opportunity to read the papers
to be presented, and I thus feel quite confident in affirming that this meeting will provide further
evidence of the development and expansion of computational linguistics in Europe. Here our field
is characterized, perhaps more than elsewhere, by the presence of a number of differentiated sectors
and by extremely profitable interdisciplinary relationships with many other fields of research. In
fact, in the last ten years, computational linguistics has rapidly increased its influence not only at
the scientific but also at the application and industrial levels.
Our work here in Pisa has always been directed towards a global view of the different aspects
of computational linguistics, and our activities range from the processing of very large corpora of
texts to the study of models of linguistic processes and structures, aiming at the integration of the
different components. Our interests are clearly shown by the themes of the various international
meetings and summer schools which we have organized here in Pisa over the last fifteen years.
Our activity during this period has been made possible by the support of the University of Pisa
and CNR. I should thus like to thank Professor Biorci, vice-president of CNR, whose efforts have
been so valuable in determining the development of our Institute, for honouring us with his presence
here today.
I should now like to conclude by wishing you all every success for your work during the next two
days, and also by expressing my particular appreciation to Professor Giacomo Ferrari, one of my
oldest colleagues, who has put so much energy and enthusiasm into the organization of this meeting.

OPENING REMARKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999813147058823">
I am very glad to open this Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computa-
tional Linguistics. I will not take much of your time, but I do want to give you a few simple
expressions of appreciation. The Italian National Research Council and I personally are honoured
and pleased because this is the first meeting of the European Chapter and because it is taking place
in Italy. Choosing this location means that the European scientific community has appreciated the
research work carried out in Italy during these past years. Our scientists feel especially proud on
this occasion, and I am sure that they will derive from this meeting a powerful encouragement to
work even harder than before.
In this fascinating sector of science, I am also glad for the choice of Pisa as the place where
the conference is being held. Pisa, in fact, as many of you already know, had a pioneering role
in this country in the field of computer science and, in particular, computational linguistics. In
this pioneering action, the University of Pisa and the National Research Council have collaborated
closely, and I am honoured to mention Professor Faedo who had the vision, the will to pursue it,
and the power to realize it, first as a mathematician, then as Rector of the University of Pisa, and
finally as the President of the National Research Council.
I am also pleased to mention Professor Zampolli, who started his work when computational
linguistics was unknown in Italy and who has given the field such an extraordinary push both
through his scientific contributions and through his fantastic enthusiasm.
Another reason for appreciating this meeting is its international character. I know that the
number and quality of the submitted papers has been really remarkable, and that the people who
came just to be here and learn from others are also outstanding. Young scientists are important,
and the relatively low average age of people in the audience makes me confident about the future
of your discipline.
Finally, I want to stress that the objectives of the National Research Council do not include
the promotion of any particular research projects. Rather the Council has a special role inside
the world of the public research institutions in Italy. Its commitment is to realize a harmonious
integration of the government&apos;s objectives with those of the scientific bodies, in particular with the
research carried out in our universities. Within this general framework and this specific commit-
ment, the National Research Council is particularly interested in research projects that have the
following primary characteristics: (a) involving scientists from different institutions, (b) attracting
international attention, and (c) having high significance for human society, for the progress and
welfare of people. Now, computational linguistics, and this meeting in particular, stresses all three
of these characteristics. So I am particularly glad to thank you for your attention and to give you
my best wishes for the full success of this conference.
