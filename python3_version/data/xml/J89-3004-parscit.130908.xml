This volume contains 18 papers and the positions pre-
sented at two panel sessions. The papers are rather
heterogeneous and the editors have not classified them
in any way.
The collection shows clearly the fast proliferation of
new logic grammars and Prolog dialects, which is per-
haps a necessary stage for a relatively new domain.
Some of the modifications are small enough to be fully
described in short Prolog listings accompanying the
papers, e.g., the functional logic grammar of Michel
Boyer or the epistemic reasoning of Manny Rayner and
Sverker Janson; in other cases we have quite large
systems practically unavailable to other parties, e.g.,
the three parsers compared by Toshiyuki Okunishi and
his colleagues. Some papers take a specific linguistic
theory or formalism as a starting point, e.g., Govern-
ment-Binding theory or Sowa&apos;s Conceptual Graphs,
while others augment existing logic grammar or pro-
gramming tools. A paper on morphological analysis of
Italian is an example of the work where it is fully
justified to use Prolog, but its use is of little relevance to
the problem under consideration.
According to my understanding of logic program-
ming, three papers are most representative of the do-
main. Patrick Saint-Dizier describes Contextual Discon-
tinuous Grammars, which form the next step in the
evolution of logic grammars started by Colmerauer&apos;s
metamorphosis grammar. Secondly, Edward P. Stabler,
Jr. reconstructs in logic a fragment of a linguistic
theory, namely, Government-Binding theory, and trans-
forms it by formally provable steps into a logic program
for parsing. Last but not least, the paper by Annie Gal
and Jack Minker on informative and cooperative an-
swers in data bases shows the advantages of using the
same formalism for representing database integrity con-
straints and natural language semantics.
As for the panels, I sympathize most with Miguel
Filgueiras (&amp;quot;logic programming can only be seen as a
programming methodology and not as a formalism con-
tributing to the study of natural language understand-
ing&amp;quot;) and Stan Szpakowicz (&amp;quot;the belief in Prolog as a
perfect tool for natural language processing may some-
times mean putting the cart before the horse&amp;quot;) but they
seemed to be in a minority.
To summarize, the volume definitely proves the
usefulness of the Prolog programming language for a
wide range of natural language processing tasks. It gives
the reader a fair account of the activities in the domain,
but leaves also some doubts as to whether the domain is
more coherent than, say, natural language understand-
ing and Lisp programming.
Janusz S. Bien, received his Ph.D. in computer science from
Warsaw University in 1978. He has recently worked on a
computational description of Polish morphology. He advo-
cated the use of Prolog for natural language processing from
the moment the first implementation became available outside
Marseilles. Bien&apos;s address is: Instytut Informatyki UW, PKiN

In this book, Herskovits proposes an analysis of loca-
tive expressions in English. Her goal is to position the
study of linguistic expressions (in particular, spatial
expressions) within a broader context of language usage
and the conventions associated with communicating
goals, beliefs, etc. Thus the work should be evaluated
from the perspective of cognitive science as an interdis-
ciplinary field, and not simply as a linguistic treatise on
prepositions or a computational model of a subset of
natural language.
The underlying semantic theory that Herskovits as-
sumes differs from more traditional &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; ap-
proaches to meaning (e.g., Tarski 1943) and is most
similar to the positions argued for by Searle (1979) and
Winograd (1980), and previously by Wittgenstein
(1963). According to these authors, the view that mean-
ing derives from the literal interpretation of the words in
