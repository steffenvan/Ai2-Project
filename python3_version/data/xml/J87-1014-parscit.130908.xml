Seuren&apos;s book can be useful and interesting for two
different kinds of readers: firstly, for those specialists
who are interested simply in problems suggested by the
title itself, and secondly, for students and other people
who are novices in the field of theoretical linguistics and
want to reach its central points going a very difficult but
also very fascinating way. This second &amp;quot;usefulness&amp;quot;
seems to be not so obvious as the first one; probably it
has not even been intended by the author. However, we
should start this review by emphasizing and lauding this
feature of the book in question.
Pieter Seuren does not try to build his theory without
having laid the foundations of it. He places his ideas in a
long tradition of linguistic thought and proposes his
answers to some essential questions relating to language
and linguistics. He considers the main goal of the study
of language to be &amp;quot;an insight into the cognitive machin-
ery which enables humans to use it the way they do&amp;quot; and
describes and criticizes the current situation in the theory
of meaning and grammar with its principal fault being the
insufficiency of linguistic facts to support abstract, formal
systems. Seuren resumes the ancient controversy
between the anomalists and the analogists and places his
book in the former tradition.
These, and many other basic theoretical statements
make this book partially open but not easy! for non-spe-
cialists who wish to familiarize themselves with some
topics of modern linguistic thought.
However, the main purpose of this book is to repre-
sent Seuren&apos;s ideas concerning semantics, especially
describing the meaning of sentences from the point of
view of their role in a discourse. Seuren is of the opinion
that the meaning of a sentence cannot be described in
isolation. The central notion of the book is thus
&amp;quot;discourse domain&amp;quot;, which is defined as a finite number
of distinct addresses, superaddresses, and instructions.
An address is a store to which every new asserted
sentence in the discourse contributes new information
about the individual referred to by the discourse. A
superaddress differs from the address in that it refers not
to individuals but to sets of individuals.
In Seuren&apos;s estimation, the meaning of a sentence
consists in &amp;quot;the systematic modification, or increment,
which it brings about whenever it is added to an appro-
priate given discourse domain&amp;quot;.
These basic definitions are contained in the first chap-
ter which is entitled &amp;quot;Discourse and interpretation&amp;quot;.
They are implemented in other parts of the book, espe-
cially in chapters 4 and 5.
In chapter 2, &amp;quot;Grammar and lexicon&amp;quot;, Seuren arraigns
the idea of surface semantics and represents his version
of traditional SA-semantics, which is based on the
assumption that surface structures are not directly inter-
pretable and, therefore, a separate level of semantic anal-
ysis is needed.
Chapter 3, &amp;quot;The logic and semantics of
presupposition&amp;quot;, gives us, among other things, the idea of
presuppositional three-valued logic which is also devel-
oped in the appendix by A. Weijters.
The book in question contains many fragments which
are really exciting. It gives a large and original picture of
one of the most important topics in modern linguistics.

The two books under review here have much in commow
not only do they both deal with the question of compre-
hension of narratives in general, but they also share the
view that this can be achieved via understanding of the
goals of the participants involved. This coincidence
perhaps stems from the shared background of the two
authors, namely the Yale-based work of Schank, Abel-
son, and others, to which both authors make reference, in
some instances extensively. In case this revelation should
lead some readers to prejudge the works immediately, it
must be said that the Schankian influence is less evident
in Wilensky&apos;s book than in Dyer&apos;s.

Book Reviews Planning and Understanding and In-Depth Understanding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991244676923077">
The similarities between the two books do not go
much further. In particular, Wilensky&apos;s coverage is
narrower, and nearer cognitive science than computa-
tional linguistics. Dyer&apos;s broader coverage stems partly
from the fact that his book is much more obviously based
on his Ph.D. thesis, and this is an important weakness:
authors and publishers should be aware that there is a big
difference between a thesis and a book, and theses must
be carefully revised and edited before they are published.
Dyer&apos;s work is a long and difficult read, even though he
has interesting things to say; Wilensky&apos;s, despite its
narrowness, is a more rewarding book.
Wilensky&apos;s first two chapters are introductory. Claim-
ing psychological relevance for his approach, he presents
understanding as being inversely related to planning:
while the latter &amp;quot;starts from a goal and proceeds towards
a plan of action&amp;quot;, the former &amp;quot;starts from perceived
actions and proceeds towards hypothesised plans and
goals&amp;quot; (pp. 17-18). In Wilensky&apos;s view, then, a computa-
tional model of narrative understanding involves model-
ling the goals and plans of the actors involved in the
narrative. Although narratives to be considered typically
are restricted to &amp;quot;mundane activities&amp;quot;, Wilensky notes
that these have more complex plan structures than appar-
ently more difficult problems (p. 11). Although individ-
ual goals may be quite simple, they often interact with
each other or — in the case of &amp;quot;meta-plans&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;meta-
goals&amp;quot; — pertain directly to each other.
Chapter 3 gives an overview of the planning model:
plans are associated with and triggered by goals, but they
also have consequences that must be taken into account,
and these consequences often affect other plans. So the
understander has four components: a goal detector, a
plan proposer, a projector (which theorises about the
consequence of carrying out plans), and an executor.
Chapter 4 notes that plans sometimes need to take
account of multiple goals that may be in conflict, and so
the concept of a &amp;quot;meta-planner&amp;quot; is introduced, which
aims to achieve &amp;quot;meta-goals&amp;quot; such as resolving such
conflicts. This need for meta-planning is further devel-
oped in Chapter 5, where it is suggested that a story-un-
derstander must be able to recognise the reasons behind
actions which do not apparently relate to the fulfilling of
any explicit goals.
The next five chapters consider in detail various types
of goal-interactions and relationships. These can be
broadly classified as internal or external, the former
involving conflict or overlap, the latter competition or
concord. Chapter 7 deals with goal conflict and competi-
tion, and suggests that this can be dealt with either by
abandoning one of the goals, altering the plan to elimi-
nate the cause of conflict, or inception of a new plan to
deal with the conflict. Knowledge about goal conflict is
very important in story understanding because it leads to
expectations in the reader about the behaviour of the
characters, or the likelihood of the goal being fulfilled.
Wilensky goes into considerable details in these chapters,
with ample exemplification. One aspect which however
is not emphasised, is the extent to which stories are inter-
esting only when readers&apos; expectations are violated.
Many of Wilensky&apos;s example narratives would in fact
make rather dull stories, because nothing unusual
happens, and one wonders how his theory would cope
with that aspect of narrative understanding. In this
respect, Dyer&apos;s approach, which is more frame-like, more
explicitly attempts to account for this aspect of narra-
tives. Wilensky categorises various types of conflict and
competition, noting that they sometimes arise from the
particular plan chosen rather than the goal itself. Chap-
ter 8 continues the theme of goal conflict, discussing
various ways in which it can be overcome, and especially
the related questions of planning to maximise the goal
achievement in a conflict situation, e.g., by partially
fulfilling all goals, or picking one as being the most
important to fulfill, or finding an alternative plan that
meets the goals but without conflicts. Conflict resolution
becomes a meta-goal with associated meta-plans, and so
on. In Chapter 9, the author talks briefly about external
conflicts, where the goals of different actors are in
competition, and compares various approaches in the
literature. Chapter 10 deals with positive goal relations,
such as overlapping goals, subsumptions and goal
concords.
The final two chapters deal with some implementa-
tions of the model, and here we get the first real indi-
cation of how what we have been reading about relates
to understanding. Making reference to earlier implemen-
tations (especially PAM) and their weaknesses, he intro-
duces the special-purpose programming language PEARL
— a frame-like formalism also resembling Prolog, and
implemented in Lisp. The representations, which are
likened to an extended version of Conceptual Dependen-
cy (but which do not actually look quite so abstract or
deep), are illustrated, and in Chapter 12 a particular
implementation, FAUSTUS, is discussed. These final two
chapters are very useful in reassuring the reader that the
preceding chapters were not purely theoretical and
certainly serve the purpose such exemplification can best
hope to fulfill, namely of assuring the plausibility and
giving some of the flavour of the implementation.
Turning now to Dyer&apos;s rather longer work, the first
general point is to mention once again the excessively
broad &amp;quot;thesis-style&amp;quot; coverage. In Dyer&apos;s defense, it
should be said that he includes in his first chapter a
&amp;quot;Guide to the Reader&amp;quot;, enabling him/her to read selec-
tively. The book is broadly divided into four parts, the
first dealing with &amp;quot;Thematic Abstraction Units&amp;quot; (TAUs),
the second with the relationship between understanding
and memory, the third with some specific knowledge
structures, and the fourth principally a detailed traced
example.
In Part I then we have the TAU, which &amp;quot;serves as a
basis for story characterization by means of cross-con-
Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 1-2, January-June 1987 75
Book Reviews Planning and Understanding and In-Depth Understanding
textual remindings and the recall of adages&amp;quot; (p. 27).
These &amp;quot;adages&amp;quot; capture in a neat saying the point of the
story. They are in effect macros representing a particular
goals-events interaction. But it is unclear whether recog-
nition of the appropriate adage (e.g., &amp;quot;Too many cooks
spoil the broth&amp;quot;) triggers the setting up of a pattern of
abstract goals and events against which to match the
events of the story, or vice-versa. If the former, one
wonders how the appropriate adage is picked out in the
first place. If the latter, then the use of adages would
seem to be no more than a gimmick, or more charitably
an initially interesting but quickly tiresome, expository
device. The question of just how the more intricate
details of the stories are to be understood is more press-
ing. On the other hand, as part of a cognitive theory of
story understanding, the idea of relating stories with simi-
lar structures is probably right, though there is also the
important point that stories are only interesting insofar as
they take an unexpected turn, as Dyer correctly notes:
&amp;quot;It is the unusual and unexpected events, including the
mistakes and failures of the characters which often make
a story memorable. By their very nature, such events
cannot be predicted in a top-down manner&amp;quot; (p. 17).
As well as TAUs, the discussion of which continues for
an excessive 75 pages, Dyer introduces the notion of
AFFECTs, which are knowledge structures relating the
emotional reactions of participants. These are important
in indicating which TAU is present, and in answering
questions about the narrative.
The second part of this book concerns the control,
coordination, and interaction of various processes, viz.,
parsing for comprehension, retrieval for question answer-
ing, and memory modification in both. Dyer&apos;s claim is
that these interactions are a key element of the integrated
narrative comprehension system, one of whose features is
the ability to understand and answer questions without
parsing them fully or even completely understanding
them. The system, called BORIS, uses &amp;quot;demons&amp;quot;, a type
of production system similar to, but more general than,
Riesbeck and Schank&apos;s &amp;quot;requests&amp;quot;, which undertake a
wide variety of tasks involving various types of know-
ledge structure. The knowledge structures used by
BORIS are firmly founded in the Yale tradition, a feature
that extends in Part III to the use of &amp;quot;I-links&amp;quot; (goal-plan-
event dependencies not unlike those discussed in
Wilensky&apos;s book), MOPs (interconnectable script-like
structures which will be familiar to followers of the Yale
School), and so on.
The final part of the book, not including a number of
appendices, contains a highly detailed worked example
which will be of great interest to anyone thinking of
simulating the model, and which is of value in that it
brings together and focuses the preceding discussion, as
well as clarifying some peripheral questions, especially
concerning the basic parsing strategies used. The book
ends with a retro- and prospective view of the general
approach, highlighting some of the theoretical discoveries
that arose from the computer implementation, and look-
ing forward to future work in the field.
As mentioned above, Dyer&apos;s book is long and thor-
ough: while this is an advantage for readers who wish to
immerse themselves in the model and get an exhaustive
view of it, for the more casual reader it is a difficult book
to get a lot out of despite the author&apos;s guide to
&amp;quot;skimming&amp;quot;. In some respects it is more overtly relevant
to Computational Linguistics than Wilensky&apos;s book,
especially in being more explicit about formalisms and
fine detail, and in dealing with run-time questions:
Wilensky only really underlines the relationship between
planning and understanding in his final chapter, whereas
the Dyer book makes this more explicit throughout.
Finally, one thing that both books are able to make
quite clear even to the most optimistic reader is that the
whole question of understanding and modelling actors&apos;
motives even in relatively banal stories is extremely
complex, and worthy of all the attention it is given.

Dyer&apos;s claim is that these interactions are a key element of the integrated narrative comprehension system, one of whose features is the ability to understand and answer questions without parsing them fully or even completely understanding them. The system, called BORIS, uses &amp;quot;demons&amp;quot;, a type of production system similar to, but more general than, Riesbeck and Schank&apos;s &amp;quot;requests&amp;quot;, which undertake a wide variety of tasks involving various types of knowledge structure. The knowledge structures used by BORIS are firmly founded in the Yale tradition, a feature that extends in Part III to the use of &amp;quot;I-links&amp;quot; (goal-planevent dependencies not unlike those discussed in Wilensky&apos;s book), MOPs (interconnectable script-like structures which will be familiar to followers of the Yale School), and so on. The final part of the book, not including a number of appendices, contains a highly detailed worked example which will be of great interest to anyone thinking of simulating the model, and which is of value in that it brings together and focuses the preceding discussion, as well as clarifying some peripheral questions, especially concerning the basic parsing strategies used. The book ends with a retroand prospective view of the general approach, highlighting some of the theoretical discoveries that arose from the computer implementation, and looking forward to future work in the field. As mentioned above, Dyer&apos;s book is long and thorough: while this is an advantage for readers who wish to immerse themselves in the model and get an exhaustive view of it, for the more casual reader it is a difficult book to get a lot out of despite the author&apos;s guide to &amp;quot;skimming&amp;quot;. In some respects it is more overtly relevant to Computational Linguistics than Wilensky&apos;s book, especially in being more explicit about formalisms and fine detail, and in dealing with run-time questions: Wilensky only really underlines the relationship between planning and understanding in his final chapter, whereas the Dyer book makes this more explicit throughout. Finally, one thing that both books are able to make quite clear even to the most optimistic reader is that the whole question of understanding and modelling actors&apos; motives even in relatively banal stories is extremely complex, and worthy of all the attention it is given.</abstract>
