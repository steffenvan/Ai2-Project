Cue phrases are linguistic expressions such as now and well that function as explicit indicators of
the structure of a discourse. For example, now may signal the beginning of a subtopic or a return
to a previous topic, while well may mark subsequent material as a response to prior material, or as
an explanatory comment. However, while cue phrases may convey discourse structure, each also
has one or more alternate uses. While incidentally may be used sententially as an adverbial,
for example, the discourse use initiates a digression. Although distinguishing discourse and
sentential uses of cue phrases is critical to the interpretation and generation of discourse, the
question of how speakers and hearers accomplish this disambiguation is rarely addressed.
This paper reports results of empirical studies on discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases,
in which both text-based and prosodic features were examined for disambiguating power. Based
on these studies, it is proposed that discourse versus sentential usage may be distinguished by
intonational features, specifically, pitch accent and prosodic phrasing. A prosodic model that
characterizes these distinctions is identified. This model is associated with features identifiable
from text analysis, including orthography and part of speech, to permit the application of the
results of the prosodic analysis to the generation of appropriate intonational features for discourse
and sentential uses of cue phrases in synthetic speech.

Cue phrases, words and phrases that directly signal the structure of a discourse,
have been variously termed clue words, discourse markers, discourse connectives,
and discourse particles in the computational linguistic and conversational analysis
literature. These include items such as now, which marks the introduction of a new
subtopic or return to a previous one; well, which indicates a response to previous
material or an explanatory comment; incidentally, by the way, and that reminds me, which
indicate the beginning of a digression; and anyway and in any case, which indicate a
return from a digression. The recognition and appropriate generation of cue phrases
is of particular interest to research in discourse structure. The structural information
conveyed by these phrases is crucial to many tasks, such as anaphora resolution (Grosz
1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985), the inference of speaker intention and
the recognition of speaker plans (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Sidner 1985; Litman and
Allen 1987), and the generation of explanations and other text (Zuckerman and Pearl
1986).
Despite the crucial role that cue phrases play in theories of discourse and their
implementation, however, many questions about how cue phrases are identified and
defined remain to be examined. In particular, the question of cue phrase polysemy has
yet to receive a satisfactory solution. Each lexical item that has one or more discourse

senses also has one or more alternate, sentential senses, which make a semantic con-
tribution to the interpretation of an utterance. So, sententially, now may be used as a
temporal adverbial, incidentally may also function as an adverbial, and well may be
used with its adverbial or attributive meanings. Distinguishing between whether a
discourse or a sentential usage is meant is obviously critical to the interpretation of
discourse.
Consider the cue phrase now. Roughly, the sentential or deictic use of now makes
reference to a span of time that minimally includes the utterance time. This time span
may include little more than moment of utterance, as in Example 1, or it may be of
indeterminate length, as in Example 2.

In this paper, we address the problem of disambiguating cue phrases in both
text and speech. We present results of several studies of cue phrase usage in corpora
of recorded, transcribed speech, in which we examined text-based and prosodic fea-
tures to find which best predicted the discourse/sentential distinction. Based on these
analyses, we present an intonational model for cue phrase disambiguation in speech,
based on prosodic phrasing and pitch accent. We associate this Model with features
identifiable from text analysis, principally orthography and part of speech, that can
be automatically extracted from large corpora. On a practical level, this association
permits the application of our findings to the identification and appropriate gener-
ation of cue phrases in synthetic speech. On a more theoretical level, our findings
provide support for theories of discourse that rely upon the feasibility of cue phrase
disambiguation to support the identification of discourse structure. Our results pro-
vide empirical evidence suggesting how hearers and readers may distinguish between
discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases. More generally, our findings can be seen
as a case study demonstrating the importance of intonational information to language
understanding and generation.
In Section 2 we review previous work on cue phrases and discuss the general
problem of distinguishing between discourse and sentential uses. In Section 3 we
introduce the theory of English intonation adopted for our prosodic analysis (Pierre-
humbert 1980; Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986). In Section 4 we present our initial
empirical studies, which focus on the analysis of the cue phrases now and well in
multispeaker spontaneous speech. In Section 5 we demonstrate that these results gen-
eralize to other cue phrases, presenting results of a larger and more comprehensive
study: an examination of all cue phrases produced by a single speaker in a 75-minute
presentation. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss the theoretical and practical applications
of our findings.

<bodyText confidence="0.99961775">
The critical role that cue phrases play in understanding and generating discourse
has often been noted in the computational linguistics literature. For example, it has
been shown that cue phrases can assist in the resolution of anaphora, by indicating the
presence of a structural boundary or a relationship between parts of a discourse (Grosz
1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985). In Example 7 (RJB86), interpretation of
the anaphor it as co-indexed with the system is facilitated by the presence of the cue
phrases say and then, marking potential antecedents in &amp;quot;as an expert database for an
expert system&amp;quot; as structurally unavailable.

If the system attempts to hold rules, say as an expert database for an expert system, then
we expect it not only to hold the rules but to in fact apply them for us in appropriate
situations.
Here, say indicates the beginning of a discourse subtopic and then signals a return
from that subtopic. Since the potential but incorrect antecedents occur in the subtopic,
while the pronoun in question appears in the return to the major topic, the incorrect
potential antecedents can be ruled out on structural grounds. Without such discourse
segmentation, the incorrect potential antecedents might have been preferred, given
their surface proximity and number agreement with the pronoun in question. Note
that without cue phrases as explicit indicators of this topic structure, one would have
to infer the relationships among discourse segments by appeal to a more detailed
analysis of the semantic content of the passage. For example, in task-oriented dialogs,
plan-based knowledge could be used to assist in the recognition of discourse structure
(Grosz 1977). However, such analysis is often beyond the capabilities of current natural
language processing systems. Many domains are also not task-oriented. Additionally,
cue phrases are widely used in the identification of rhetorical relations among portions
of a text or discourse (Hobbs 1979; Mann and Thompson 1983; Reichman 1985), and
have been claimed in general to reduce the complexity of discourse processing and
to increase textual coherence in natural language processing systems (Cohen 1984;
Litman and Allen 1987; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986).
Previous attempts to characterize the set of cue phrases in the linguistic and in the
computational literature have typically been extensional, with each cue phrase or set
of phrases associated with one or more discourse or conversational functions. In the
linguistic literature, cue phrases have been the subject of a number of theoretical and
descriptive corpus-based studies that emphasize the diversity of meanings associated
with cue phrases as a class, within an overarching framework of function such as
discourse cohesiveness or conversational moves, and the diversity of meanings that
an individual item can convey (Halliday and Hassan 1976; Schiffrin 1987; Schourup
1985; Warner 1985).
In the computational literature, the functions assigned to each cue phrase, while
often more specific than those identified in the linguistics literature, are usually the-
ory or domain-dependent. Reichman (1985) and Hobbs (1979) associate groups of cue
phrases with the rhetorical relations among segments of text that they signal; in these
approaches, the cue phrase taxonomy is dependent upon the set of rhetorical rela-
tions assumed. Alternatively, Cohen (1984) adopts a taxonomy of connectives based
on Quirk (1972) to assign each class of cue phrase a function in her model of argu-
ment understanding. Grosz and Sidner (1986), in their tripartite model of discourse
structure, classify cue phrases based on the changes they signal to the attentional
and intentional states. Zukerman (1986) presents a taxonomy of cue phrases based
on three functions in the generation of tutorial explanations: knowledge organization,
knowledge acquisition, and affect maintenance. Table 14 in the Appendix compares
the characterization of items classed as cue phrases in a number of these classification
schemes.
The question of cue phrase sense ambiguity has been noted in both the compu-
tational and the linguistic literature, although only cursory attention has been paid to
how disambiguation might take place. A common assumption in the computational
literature is that hearers can use surface position within a sentence or clause to distin-
guish discourse from sentential uses. In fact, most systems that recognize or generate
cue phrases assume a canonical (usually first) position for discourse cue phrases within

the clause (Reichman 1985; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986). Schiffrin (1987) also assumes
that discourse uses of cue phrases are utterance initial.
However, discourse uses of cue phrases can in fact appear noninitially in a clause,
as illustrated by the item say in Example 8 (RJB86).

However, if we took that language and added one simple operator which we called
restriction which allowed us for example to form relational concepts like say, son and
daughter, that is a child who is always male or is always female.
Also, sentential usages can appear clause initially, as in Example 9 (RJB86).

We&apos;ve got to get to some inferential capability. Further meaning of the structures is
crucially important.
Furthermore, surface clausal position itself may be ambiguous in the absence of or-
thographic disambiguation. Consider Example 10 (HG82).

Evelyn: I see. So in other words I will have to pay the full amount of the uh of the tax
now what about Pennsylvania state tax? Can you give me any information on that?
Here, now would be assigned a sentential interpretation if associated with the preced-
ing clause, I will have to pay the full amount of the. . . tax now, but a discourse interpretation
if associated with the succeeding clause, Now what about Pennsylvania state tax? Thus,
surface position alone appears inadequate to distinguish between discourse and sen-
tential usage.
However, when we listen to examples such as Example 10, we have little difficulty
in identifying a discourse meaning for now. Similarly, the potentially troublesome case
cited in Example 6 is easily disambiguated when one listens to the recording itself.
What is missing from transcription that helps listeners to make such distinctions easily?
Halliday and Hassan (1976, p. 268) note that their class of continuatives, which
includes items such as now, of course, well, anyway, surely, and after all (i.e., items also
commonly classed as cue phrases), vary intonationally with respect to cohesive func-
tion. In particular, continuatives are often &amp;quot;reduced&amp;quot; intonationally when they function
&amp;quot;cohesively&amp;quot; to relate one part of a text to another (i.e., in their discourse use), un-
less they are &amp;quot;very definitely contrastive&amp;quot;; that is, continuatives are unaccented, with
reduced vowel forms, unless they are marked as unusually prominent intonationally.
For example, they note that, if now is reduced, it can indicate &amp;quot;the opening of a new
stage in the communication,&amp;quot; such as a new point in an argument or a new incident
in a story. On the other hand, noncohesive uses, which we would characterize as
sentential, tend to be of nonreduced, accented forms.
So, perhaps it is the intonational information present in speech, but missing gen-
erally in transcription, which aids hearers in disambiguating between discourse and
sentential uses of cue phrases. Empirical evidence from more general studies of the
intonational characteristics of word classes tends to support this possibility. Studies of
portions of the Londonâ€”Lund corpus such as Altenberg (1987) have provided intona-
tional profiles of word classes including discourse items, conjunctions and adverbials
that are roughly compatible with the notion that cue phrases tend to be deaccented,

although the notion of discourse item used in this study is quite restrictive.1 However,
while the instance of now in Example 6 is in fact reduced, as Halliday and Hassan
(1976) propose, that in Example 10, while interpreted as a discourse use, is nonethe-
less clearly intonationally prominent. Furthermore, both of the nows in Example 5 are
also prominent. So it would seem that intonational prominence alone is insufficient to
disambiguate between sentential and discourse uses.
In this paper we present a more complex model of intonational features and text-
based features that can serve to disambiguate between sentential and discourse in-
stances of cue phrases. Our model is based on several empirical studies (Hirschberg
and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990): two studies of individual cue phrases
in which we develop our model, and a more comprehensive study of cue phrases as a
class, in which we confirm and expand our model. Before describing these studies and
their results, we must first describe the intonational features examined in our analyses.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999695">
The importance of intonational information to the communication of discourse struc-
ture has been recognized in a variety of studies (Butterworth 1975; Schegloff 1979;
Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns 1980; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Pierrehumbert
and Hirschberg 1990; Silverman 1987). However, just which intonational features are
important and how they communicate discourse information is not well understood.
Prerequisite, however, to addressing these issues is the adoption of a framework of
intonational description to identify which intonational features will be examined and
how they will be characterized. For the studies discussed below, we have adopted
Pierrehumbert&apos;s (1980) theory of English intonation, which we will describe briefly
below.
In Pierrehumbert&apos;s phonological description of English, intonational contours, or
tunes, are described as sequences of low (L) and high (H) tones in the fundamental
frequency (FO) contour, the physical correlate of pitch. These tunes have as their
domain the intonational phrase, and are defined in terms of the pitch accent(s), phrase
accent(s), and boundary tone, which together comprise an intonational phrase.
One of the intonational features we examine with respect to cue phrases is the
accent status of each cue; that is, whether or not the cue phrase is accented, or made
intonationally prominent, and, if it is accented, what type of pitch accent it bears.
Pitch accents usually appear as peaks or valleys in the FO contour. They are aligned
with the stressed syllables of lexical items, making those items prominent. Note that,
while every lexical item in English has a lexically stressable syllable, which is the
rhythmically most prominent syllable in the word, not every stressable syllable is in
fact accented; so, lexical stress is distinguished from pitch accent. Lexical items that
do bear pitch accents are said to be accented, while those not so marked are said to
be deaccented. Items that are deaccented tend to be function words or items that are
given in a discourse (Prince 1981). For example, in Figure 1, now is deaccented, while
cue is accented. Contrast Figure 1 with Figure 2. For ease of comparison, we present FO
contours of synthetic speech, where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis, frequency
in Hz.2 In Figure 1, the first FO peak occurs on let&apos;s; in Figure 2, the first peak occurred
on now. The most prominent accent in a phrase is termed the nuclear stress, or nuclear

the FO excursions illustrated in Figures 1-5, accented syllables tend to be longer and
louder than deaccented syllables, so there are a number of acoustic correlates of this
perceptual phenomenon.
In Pierrehumbert&apos;s description of English, there are six types of pitch accent, all
composed of either a single low (L*) or high (H*) tone or an ordered pair of low and
high tones, such as L+H* or H*+L. In each case, the tone aligned with the stressed
syllable of the accented lexical item is indicated by a star (*); thus, if telephone is uttered
with a L*+H accent, the low tone (L*) is aligned with the stressed syllable /tell, and
the H tone falls on the remainder of the word. For simple pitch accents, of course, the

Julia Hirschberg and Diane Litman Disambiguation of Cue Phrases
In Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990), a compositional approach to intonational
meaning is proposed in which pitch accents are viewed as conveying information
status, such as newness or salience, about the denotation of the accented items and
the relationship of denoted entities, states, or attributes to speaker and hearer&apos;s mutual
beliefs about the discourse. In particular, it is claimed that speakers use H* accents
to indicate that an item represents new information, which should be added to their
mutual belief space. For example, standard declarative utterances in English commonly
involve H* accents. L* accents, on the other hand, are used to indicate that an item
is salient in the discourse but for some reason should not be part of what is added
to the mutual belief space; standard yes/no question contour in English employs L*
accents. The meanings associated with the H+L accents are explained in terms of the
accented item&apos;s ability to be inferred from the mutual belief space: H*+L items are
marked as inferable from the mutual belief space but nonetheless part of what is to
be added to that space; H+L* accents are inferable and not to be added to speaker
and hearer&apos;s mutual beliefs. L+H accents are defined in terms of the evocation of a
scale, defined as a partially ordered set following (Hirschberg 1991): L*+H accents,
often associated with the conveyance of uncertainty or of incredulity, evoke a scale
but predicate nothing of the accented item with respect to the mutual belief space;
L+H* accents, commonly associated with contrastive stress, also evoke a scale but do
add information about the accented item to speaker and hearer&apos;s mutual belief space
(Pierrehumbert and Steele 1987; Hirschberg and Ward 1992).
Another intonational feature that is considered in our study of cue phrases is
prosodic phrasing. There are two levels of such phrasing in Pierrehumbert&apos;s theory,
the intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase, a smaller sub-unit. A well-formed
intermediate phrase consists of one or more pitch accents plus a high (H) or low (L)
phrase accent. The phrase accent controls the pitch between the last pitch accent of
the current intermediate phrase and the beginning of the nextâ€”or the end of the
utterance. An intonational phrase is composed of one of more intermediate phrases,
plus a boundary tone. Boundary tones may be high (H%) or low (L%) also, and fall
exactly at the edge of the intonational phrase. So, each intonational phrase ends with
a phrase accent and a boundary tone.
A given sentence may be uttered with considerable variation in phrasing. For
example, the utterance in Figure 2 was produced as a single intonational phrase,
whereas in Figure 5 now is set off as a separate phrase.
Intuitively, prosodic phrases divide an utterance into meaningful &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot; of in-
formation (Bolinger 1989). Variation in phrasing can change the meaning hearers assign
to tokens of a given sentence. For example, the interpretation of a sentence like Bill
doesn&apos;t drink because he&apos;s unhappy is likely to change, depending upon whether it is
uttered as one phrase or two. Uttered as a single phrase, this sentence is commonly
interpreted as conveying that Bill does indeed drinkâ€”but the cause of his drinking is
not his unhappiness. Uttered as two phrases (Bill doesn&apos;t drinkâ€”because he&apos;s unhappy),
it is more likely to convey that Bill does not drinkâ€”and the reason for his abstinence
is his unhappiness. In effect, variation in phrasing appears to change the scope of
negation in the sentence. When the sentence is uttered as a single phrase the negative
is interpreted as having wide scopeâ€”over the entire phrase, and, thus, the entire sen-
tence. When Bill doesn&apos;t drink is separated from the second clause by a phrase boundary,
the scope of negation is limited to just the first clause.
The occurrence of phrase accents and boundary tones in the FO contour, together
with other phrase-final characteristics such as pause, decrease in amplitude, glottal-
ization of phrase-final syllables, and phrase-final syllable lengthening, enable us to
identify intermediate and intonational phrases in natural speech. Identification of pitch

employed here has been found to be quite reliable between transcribers.3
Meaningful intonational variation has been found in studies of phrasing, choice
of accent type and location, overall tune type, and variation in pitch range, where the
pitch range of an intonational phrase is defined by its toplineâ€”roughly, the highest
peak in the FO contour of the phraseâ€”and the speaker&apos;s baseline, the lowest point
the speaker realizes in normal speech, measured across all utterances. In the studies
described below, we examined each of these features, in addition to text-based features,
to see which best predicted cue phrase disambiguation, and to look for associations
among text-based and intonational features.

Our first study of cue phrase disambiguation investigated multispeaker usage of the
cue phrase now in a recorded, transcribed radio call-in program (Hirschberg and Lit-
man 1987). Our corpus consisted of four days of the radio call-in program &amp;quot;The Harry
Gross Show: Speaking of Your Money,&amp;quot; recorded during the week of February 1, 1982
(Pollack, Hirschberg, and Webber 1982). In this Philadelphia program, Gross offered
financial advice to callers; for the February 3 show, he was joined by an accountant
friend, Fred Levy. The four shows provided approximately ten hours of conversation
between expert(s) and callers. The corpus was transcribed by Martha Pollack and Julia
Hirschberg in 1982, in connection with another study.
We chose now for this initial study for several reasons. First, the corpus contained
numerous instances of both discourse and sentential usages of now (approximately
350 in all). Second, now often appears in conjunction with other cue phrases, e.g., well
now, ok now, right now. This allowed us to study how adjacent cue phrases interact

with one another. Third, now has a number of desirable phonetic characteristics. As
it is monosyllabic, possible variation in stress patterns do not arise to complicate the
analysis. Because it is completely voiced and introduces no segmental effects into the
FO contour, it is also easier to analyze pitch tracks reliably.
Our model was initially developed from a sample consisting of 48 occurrences of
nowâ€”all the instances from two sides of tapes of the show chosen at random. Two
instances were excluded since the phrasing was difficult to determine due to hesitation
or interruption. To test the validity of our initial hypotheses, we then replicated our
study with a second sample from the same corpus, the first 52 instances of now taken
from another four randomly chosen sides of tapes. We excluded two tokens from these
tapes because of lack of available information about phrasing or accent and five others
because we were unable to decide whether the tokens were discourse or sentential.
Our data analysis included the following steps. First, the authors determined sep-
arately, and by ear, whether individual tokens were discourse or sentential usages and
tagged the transcript of the corpus accordingly. We then digitized and pitch-tracked
the intonational phrase containing each token, plus the preceding and succeeding
intonational phrases, if produced by the same speaker.&apos; Intonational features were
determined by one of the authors from the speech and pitch tracks, separately from
the discourse/sentential judgment. Discourse and sentential uses were then compared
along several dimensions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998355583333333">
1. Each instance of now was examined to determine if it was accented and,
if so, to determine what type of accent was employed.
2. Differences in phrasing, in particular whether or not now represented an
entire intermediate or intonational phrase, were identified.
3. Now&apos;s position in its intonational and its intermediate phrase (first, not
first but preceded only by other cue phrases, last, or none of these) was
noted.
4. The type of intonational contour used over the phrase in which now
occurred was determined.
5. Whether and how now occurred adjacent to other cue phrases was noted.
6. The position of the phrase containing now with respect to speaker turn
was noted.

<bodyText confidence="0.99601275">
Of these comparisons, the first three turned out to distinguish between discourse
and sentential now quite reliably. In particular, a combination of accent type, phrasal
composition, and phrasal position reliably distinguished between the tokens in the
corpus.

Of the 100 tokens of now from the combined 48- and 52-token corpora, just over one-
third of our samples (37) were judged to be sentential, and just under two-thirds (63)
discourse. The first striking difference between the two appeared in the composition
of the intermediate phrase containing the item, as illustrated in Table 1. Of all the

sentential uses of now, only one appeared as the only item in an intermediate phrase,
while 26 (41.3%) discourse nows represented entire intermediate phrases. Of these 26,
one half constituted the only lexical item in a full intonational phrase. So, our findings
suggested that now set apart as a separate intermediate phrase is very likely to be
interpreted as conveying a discourse meaning rather than a sentential one.
Another clear distinction between discourse and sentential now emerged when
we examined the surface position of now within its intermediate phrase. As Table 2
illustrates, 62 of the 63 discourse nows (98.4%) were first-in-phrase, absolutely first or
followed only another cue phrase in their intermediate phrase; of these, 59 (95.2%)
were also absolutely first in their intonational phrase; that is, first in major prosodic
phrase and not preceded by any other cue phrases. Only five (13.5%) sentential tokens
were first-in-phrase. Also, while 22 (59.5%) sentential nows were phrase final, only
one discourse token was so positioned. So, once intermediate phrases are identified,
discourse and sentential now appear to be generally distinguishable by position within
the phrase.
Finally, discourse and sentential occurrences were distinguishable in terms of pres-
ence or absence of pitch accentâ€”and by type of pitch accent, where accented. Because
of the large number of possible accent types, and since there are competing reasons
to accent or deaccent items, such as accenting to indicate contrastive stress or deac-
centing to indicate an item is already given in the discourse, we might expect these
findings to be less clear than those for phrasing. In fact, although their interpretation
is more complicated, the results are equally striking.
Results of an analysis of the 97 occurrences from this sample for which accent
type could be precisely determined are presented in Table 3. Of those tokens not
included, two discourse tokens were judged either L* or H* with a compressed pitch
range, and one discourse token was judged either deaccented or L*. Note first that
large numbers of discourse and sentential tokens were uttered with a H* or complex
accent-16 (26.7%) discourse and 32 (86.5%) sentential tokens. The chief similarity here
lies in the use of the H* accent type, with 14 discourse uses and 14 sentential; 7 other
sentential tokens are ambiguous between H* and complex. Note also that discourse
now was much more likely overall to be deaccented-31 of the 60 discourse tokens

(51.7%) versus 5 of the 37 sentential nows (13.5%). No sentential now was uttered with
a L* accentâ€”although 13 discourse nows were.
An even sharper distinction in accent type is found if we exclude those nows that
are alone in intermediate phrase from the analysis. Recall from Table 1 that all but one
of these tokens represented a discourse use. These nows were always accented, since it
is generally the case that each intermediate phrase contains at least one pitch accent.
Of the discourse tokens representing entire intermediate phrases for which we can
distinguish accent type precisely, 14 bore H* accents. This suggests that one similarity
between discourse and sentential nowâ€”the frequent H* accentâ€”might disappear if
we limit our comparison to those tokens forming part of larger intonational phrases.
In fact, such is the case, as is shown in Table 4.
The majority, 31 (86.1%), of sentential nows forming part of larger intonational
phrases received a H* or complex pitch accent, while all 36 discourse nows forming
part of larger intonational phrases were deaccented or bore a L* accent. In fact, those
discourse nows not distinguishable from sentential by being set apart as separate in-
tonational phrases were generally so distinguishable with respect to pitch accent. Of
the three discourse tokens whose pitch accent type was not identifiable, which were
omitted from Table 3, two were set apart as separate intonational phrases and one was
judged either to bear a L* pitch accent or to be deaccented. Thus, all three could be
distinguished from sentential tokens in terms of accent type and phrasing. Further-
more, of the five deaccented sentential nows in Table 4, none was first-in-phrase, while
only one of the deaccented discourse tokens was similarly noninitial. In fact, of the
100 tokens in our initial study of now, all but two were distinguishable as discourse or
sentential in terms of a combination of position in phrase, phrasal composition, and
accent.
Thus, we were able to hypothesize from our study of now that discourse uses
were either uttered as a single intermediate phrase or in a phrase containing only
cue phrases (Discourse Type A), or uttered at the beginning of a longer intermediate
phrase, or preceded only by other cue phrases in the phrase and with a L* pitch accent,
or without a pitch accent (Discourse Type B).5 Only one of the 37 cue phrases judged

4.2 Speaker Variability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988375">
Since the preponderance of tokens in our sample from one professional speaker might
well skew our results, we compared characteristics of phrasing and accent for host and
nonhost data. The results showed no significant differences between host and caller
tokens in terms of the hypotheses proposed above. First, host (n=37) and callers (n=63)
produced discourse and sentential tokens in roughly similar proportions-40.5% sen-
tential for the host and 34.9% for his callers. Similarly, there was no distinction between
host and nonhost data in terms of choice of accent type, or accenting versus deaccent-
ing. Our findings for position within phrase also hold for both host and nonhost data.
However, in tendency to set discourse now apart as a separate intonational or interme-
diate phrase, there was an interesting distinction. While callers tended to choose from
among the two options for discourse now in almost equal numbers (48.8% of their dis-
course nows were separate phrases), the host chose this option only 27.3% of the time.
However, although host and caller data differed in the proportion of occurrences of the
two classes of discourse now that emerge from our data as a whole, the existence of the
classes themselves was confirmed. Where the host did not produce discourse nows set
apart as separate intonational or intermediate phrases, he always produced discourse

promising results for the cue phrase ok (Swora and Beckman 1991; Hockey personal communication).

4.3 Distinguishing Discourse and Sentential Usage in Transcriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992536585366">
Our conclusion from this study, that intonational features play a crucial role in the
distinction between discourse and sentential usage in speech, clearly poses problems
for text. Do readers use strategies different from hearers to make this distinction, and,
if so, what might they be? Are there perhaps orthographic correlates of the intona-
tional features that we have found to be important in speech? As a first step toward
resolving these questions, we examined the orthographic features of the transcripts
of our corpus, which, as noted in Section 3, had been prepared independently of this
study and without regard for intonational analysis.
We examined transcriptions of all tokens of now in our combined sample to deter-
mine whether prosodic phrasing was reliably associated with orthographic marking.
There were no likely orthographic clues to accent type or placement, such as capi-
talization, in the transcripts. Of all 60 instances of now that were absolutely first in
their intonational phrase, 34 (56.7%) were preceded by punctuationâ€”a comma, dash,
or end punctuationâ€”and 17 (28.3%) were first in speaker turn, and thus orthograph-
ically marked by indication of speaker name. So, in 51(85%) cases, first position in
intonational phrase coincided with orthographic indicators in the transcript. No now
that was not absolutely first in its intonational phraseâ€”for example, none that was
merely first in its intermediate phraseâ€”was so marked. Of those 23 nows coming last
in an intermediate or intonational phrase, however, only 14 (60.9%) were immediately
followed by a similar orthographic clue. Finally, of the 13 instances of now that formed
separate intonational phrases, only two (15.4%) were distinguished orthographically
by being both preceded and followed by some orthographic indicator. And none of
the nows that formed complete intermediate phrases, but not complete intonational
phrases, was so marked.
These findings suggest that, of the intonational features we found useful in dis-
ambiguating cue phrases in speech, only the feature first in intonational phrase has
any clear orthographic correlate. This correlation, however, seems potentially to be a
useful one. Of the 63 discourse nows in our corpus, recall that 59 (93.7%) were first
in their intonational phrase. Of these 59, 48 were preceded by orthographic indica-
tors in the transcription, as described above. Of sentential cues, 22 were last in their
intermediate phrase, and, of these, 13 were followed by some orthographic indicator
in the transcription. Of 34 cue phrases that were neither preceded nor followed by
orthographic markings in the transcription, the majority (21, or 61.8%) were senten-
tial uses. If we predict sentential/discourse usage based simply on the presence or
absence of preceding and succeeding orthographic markings, we would predict that
cue phrases preceded by orthographic indicators represent discourse uses, and that
phrases either followed by orthographic indicators or neither preceded nor followed
would be sentential uses, for a total of 82 correct predictions for the 100 cue phrases in
this study. Thus, 82% of nows might be orthographically distinguished. We will have
more to say on the role of orthography in disambiguating cue phrases in connection
with the study described in Section 5.

4.4 Multispeaker Study of Well

discourse and sentential (temporal adverbial) uses, it may of course also be seen as rep-
resentative of sense ambiguities between temporals and nontemporals or deictics and
nondeictics. Thus, if indeed our findings generalize, it might be to a class we had not
intended to investigate. To discover further evidence that our results did indeed apply
to the discourse/sentential use disambiguation, we conducted another multispeaker
study, this time of the discourse and sentential uses of the single cue phrase well.
Again, our corpus consisted of recordings of the Harry Gross radio call-in program. In
addition, we used tokens from several other corpora of recorded, transcribed speech,
including the corpus described in Section 5. This time we included no more than three
tokens from any speaker to minimize the potential effect of speaker idiosyncracy.
Our findings for this study of well were almost identical to results from the earlier
study of now, described above. Briefly, of the 52 instances of well we examined, all
but one token fit the model constructed from the results of the now study, depicted
in Figure 6. In particular, of the 25 sentential uses of well, none constituted a single
intermediate or intonational phrase. Only two sentential tokens were first-in-phrase,
and both of these bore H* pitch accents. However, of the 27 discourse tokens of well, 14
were indeed alone in their intonational or intermediate phrases. All of the remaining
13 occurred first-in-phrase, and, of these 12 were deaccented. In all, 51(98.1%) of the
tokens in this study fit our model; the single counter-example was one discourse token,
which bore a H* pitch accent and was part of a larger phrase.
Our study of well thus appeared to confirm our earlier results, and, in particular,
to lend support to our hypothesis that cue phrases can be distinguished intonationally.
However, although we had shown that two cue phrases appeared to pattern similarly
in this respect, we had still not demonstrated that our model could be extended to cue
phrases in general. To address this larger issue, we next conducted a single-speaker
multi-cue phrase study.

5. The Single-Speaker/Multi-Cue Phrase Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980149523809524">
In this study, we examined all cue phrases consisting of a single lexical item that were
produced by one speaker during 75 minutes, approximately 12,500 words, of recorded
speech. Results of a pilot study of this corpus are reported in Litman and Hirschberg
(1990). We limited ourselves here to the examination of single lexical items, since the
hypothesis we had previously developed applies only to such items; e.g., it would be
meaningless to ask whether a larger phrase bears a pitch accent or not. The corpus
consisted of a keynote address given from notes by Ronald Brachman at the First
International Conference on Expert Database Systems in 1986. This talk yielded 953 tokens,
based upon a set of possible cue phrases derived from Cohen (1984), Grosz and Sidner
(1986), Litman and Hirschberg (1990), Reichman (1985), Schiffrin (1987), Warner (1985),
and Zuckerman and Pearl (1986). The frequency distribution of the tokens is shown
in Table 5.
By far the most frequent cue phrase occurring in our corpus is the conjunction
and, representing 320 (33.6%) tokens. The next most frequent item is now, with only 69
occurrences. Other items occurring more than 50 times each in the corpus are but, like,
or, and so. Note that there are 444 conjunctionsâ€”and, but, and orâ€”comprising nearly
half of the cue phrases in our corpus. In addition to the items shown in Table 5, we
searched the corpus unsuccessfully for instances of the following cue phrases proposed
in the literature (cf. Table 14): accordingly, alright, alternately, alternatively, altogether,
anyway, boy, consequently, conversely, fine, furthermore, gee, hence, hey, incidentally, likewise,
listen, meanwhile, moreover, namely, nevertheless, nonetheless, nor, oh, though, yet.

However, note that the set of items included in Table 14 is not identical to the
set we have considered in this paper. In particular, we do consider the items actually,
basically, essentially, except, generally, no, right, since, and yes (cf. Table 5), although they
are not considered in the studies included in Table 14. We do not consider again, equally,
hopefully, last, only, overall, still, thus, too, unless, where, whereas, and why, although these
have been included by others in the set of possible cue phrases.
The temporal pattern of cue phrase use in the corpus exhibits some interesting
features. While tokens were distributed fairly evenly during the middle portion of
the talk, the first and last portions were less regular. The first decile of the transcript,
defined by length in words, contained 140 cue phrases (14.7%), a higher proportion
than any other decile of the corpus, while the second decile contained only 73 (7.7%).
And the last decile of the talk contained an even lower proportion of cue phrasesâ€”
only 64 (6.7%). So, it appears that, at least for this genre, cue phrases occur more
frequently in the introductory remarks, and less frequently in the conclusion.
To classify each token as discourse or sentential, the authors separately judged
each one by ear from the taped address while marking a transcription. Where we could
not make a decision, we labeled the token ambiguous; so, any token could be judged
&amp;quot;discourse,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;sentential,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ambiguous.&amp;quot; The address was transcribed independently
of our study by a member of the text processing pool at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. In
examining the transcription, we found that 39 cue phrases had been omitted by the
transcriber: one token each of actually, essentially, or, and well, three tokens each of so
and ok, nine tokens of and, and twenty tokens of now. It seemed significant that all but
five of these were subsequently termed discourse uses by both judgesâ€”that is, that
discourse uses seemed somehow omissible to the transcriber. One of the authors then
assessed each token&apos;s prosodic characteristics, as described in Section 4.
In examining our classification judgments, we were interested in areas of disagree-
ment as well as agreement. The set of tokens whose classification we both agreed upon
and found unambiguous provided a testbed for our investigation of the intonational

features marking discourse and sentential interpretation. We examined the set of to-
kens one or both of us found ambiguous to determine how intonation might in fact
have contributed to that ambiguity. Table 6 presents the distribution of our judgments,
where classifiable includes those tokens we both assigned either discourse or senten-
tial, ambiguous identifies those we both were unable to classify, partial disagreement
includes those only one of us was able to classify, and complete disagreement rep-
resents those tokens one of us classified as discourse and the other as sentential. Of
the 953 tokens in this corpus, we agreed in our judgments of 878 cue phrases (92.1%)
as discourse or sentential. Another 59 (6.2%) tokens we both judged ambiguous. We
disagreed on only 16 items (1.7%); for 11 of these, the disagreement was between
classifiable and ambiguous.
When we examined the areas of ambiguity and disagreement in our judgments, we
found that a high proportion of these involved judgments of coordinate conjunction
tokens, and, or, and but, which, as we previously noted, represent nearly half of the
tokens in this study. Table 6 shows that, comparing conjunction with nonconjunction,
we agreed on the classification of 495 (97.2%) nonconjunction tokens but only 383
(86.3%) conjunctions. We both found 48 (10.8%) conjunctions ambiguous, but only 11
(2.2%) nonconjunctions; 48 of the 59 tokens we agreed were ambiguous in the corpus
were, in fact, coordinate conjunctions. Of the 16 tokens on which we simply disagreed,
13 (81.3%) were conjunctions.
The fact that conjunctions account for a large number of the ambiguities we found
in the corpus and the disagreements we had about classification is not surprising
when we note that the discourse meanings of conjunction as described in the literature
(see Table 14) seem to be quite similar to the meanings of sentential conjunction. For
example, the discourse use of and is defined as &apos;parallelism&apos; in Cohen (1984), &apos;a marker
of addition&apos; or &apos;sequential continuity&apos; in Schriffin (1987), and &apos;conjunction&apos; in Warner
(1985). These definitions fail to provide clear guidelines for distinguishing discourse
uses from sentential, as in cases such as Example 11 (RJB86). Here, while the first and
seems intuitively sentential, the second is much more problematic.

may make the need to classify them less important from either a text generation or a
text understanding point of view.
Once we had classified the tokens in the corpus, we analyzed them for their
prosodic and syntactic features as well as their orthographic context, in the same way
we had examined tokens for the earlier two studies. In each case, we noted whether
the cue phrase was accented or not and, if accented, we noted the type of accent
employed. We also looked at whether the token constituted an entire intermediate or
intonational phraseâ€”possibly with other cue phrasesâ€”or not, and what each token&apos;s
position within its intermediate phrase and larger intonational phrase wasâ€”first-in-
phrase (again, including tokens preceded only by other cue phrases as well as tokens
that were absolutely first in intermediate phrase), last, or other. We also examined
each item&apos;s part of speech, using Church&apos;s (1988) part-of-speech tagger. Finally, we
investigated orthographic features of the transcript that might be associated with a
discourse/sentential distinction, such as immediately preceding and succeeding punc-
tuation and paragraph boundaries. In both the syntactic and orthographic analyses we
were particularly interested in discovering how successful nonprosodic features that
might be obtained automatically from a text would be in differentiating discourse from
sentential uses.
5.1 Results of the Intonational Analysis
We looked first at the set of 878 tokens whose classification as discourse or sentential
we both agreed upon. Our findings from this set confirmed the prosodic model we
found in the studies described above to distinguish discourse from sentential uses
successfully. The distribution of these judgments with respect to the prosodic model
of discourse and sentential cue phrases depicted in Figure 6 is shown in Table 7. Recall
that the prosodic model in Figure 6 includes the following intonational profiles: Dis-
course Type A, in which a cue phrase constitutes an entire intermediate phrase, or is
in a phrase containing only other cue phrases, and may have any type of pitch accent;
Discourse Type B, in which a cue phrase occurs at the beginning of a larger interme-
diate phrase, or is preceded only by other cue phrases, and bears a L* pitch accent
or is deaccented; Sentential Type A, in which the cue phrase occurs at the beginning
of a larger phrase and bears a H* or complex pitch accent; and Sentential Type B, in
which the cue phrase occurs in noninitial position in a larger phrase. Table 7 shows
that our prosodic model fits the new data reasonably well, successfully predicting 662
(75.4%) of the classified tokens. Of the 341 cue phrases we both judged discourse, 301
(88.3%) fit the prosodic discourse model; 50 of these were of Discourse Type A and 251
were of Discourse Type B. Of the 537 tokens we both judged sentential, 361 (67.2%)
fit one of the prosodic sentential models. The overall ratio of cue phrases judged dis-

course to those judged sentential was about 2:3. A X2 test shows significance at the
.001 level.&apos; While these results are highly significant, they clearly do not match the
previous findings for now and well discussed in Section 4, in which all but three tokens
fit our model.
So, for this larger study, the tokens which did not fit our prosodic model remain
to be explained. In fact, there is some regularity among these counter-examples. For
example, 8 (20%) of the items judged discourse that did not fit our discourse prosodic
model were tokens of the cue phrase say. All of these failed to fit our prosodic discourse
model by virtue of the fact that they occurred in noninitial phrasal position; such items
are illustrated in Example 8. Of the 176 items judged sentential that failed to fit our
sentential prosodic model, 138 (78.4%) were conjunctions. Of these, 11 fit the Discourse
Type A prosodic model and 127 fit the Discourse Type B model. Both judges found
such items relatively difficult to distinguish between discourse and sentential use,
as discussed above. Table 8 shows how judgments are distributed with respect to
our prosodic model when coordinate conjunctions are removed from the sample. Our
model thus predicts 422 (85.3%) of nonconjunction cue phrase distinctions, somewhat
better than the 662 (75.4%) successful predictions for all classified cue phrases, as
shown in Table 7.
Our prosodic model itself can of course be decomposed to examine the contri-
butions of individual features to discourse/sentential judgments. Table 9 shows the
distribution of judgments by all possible feature complexes for all tokens. Note that
four cells (ONFD, ONFH, ONFL, and ONFC) are empty, since all items alone in their
intermediate phrase must perforce come first in it.
This distribution reveals that there is considerable agreement when cue phrases
appear alone in their intermediate phrase (tokens coded with initial OF, corresponding
to Discourse Type A in Figure 6): such items are most frequently judged to be discourse
uses. There is also considerable agreement (163 tokens, or 92.6%) on the classification
of the tokens between the authors in such cases.
There is even greater agreement when cue phrases appear in noninitial position in
a larger intermediate phrase (NONF*â€”Sentential Type B in Figure 6); these tend to be
judged sentential. When the token is deaccented, or receives a complex or high accent
(NONFD, NONFC and NONFH), the fit with the model, as well as the agreement
figures on classification, are especially striking. A small majority of tokens in the L*
accent class (NONFL) do not fit the sentential prosodic model; note that the agreement

level producing this classification was good. However, as with the OFD subtype of
Discourse Type A, which also has the worst results for its class, we have the fewest
tokens for this prosodic type.
Tokens that fit Discourse Type B in Figure 6-first in a larger phrase and deac-
cented (NOFD) or first in a larger phrase and bearing a L* accent (NOFL)-appear
more problematic: of the former, there was more disagreement than agreement be-
tween the judge&apos;s classification and the prosodic prediction of the classification. And
of the 153 sentential items that fit this discourse prosodic model, 127 (83.0%) are con-
junctions. The level of disagreement for the judge&apos;s classifications was also highest for
Discourse Type B.
While there is more agreement that tokens corresponding to Sentential Model A
and characterized as NOFH-first in a larger phrase with a H* accent-or NOFC-first
in a larger phrase and bearing a complex pitch accent, are sentential, this agreement is
certainly less striking than in the case of tokens corresponding to Sentential Model B
and characterized here as NONF*-noninitial in a larger phrase with any type of pitch
accent. Since Discourse Type B and Sentential Type A differ from each other only in
type of pitch accent, we might conclude that the pitch accent feature is not as powerful
a discriminator as the fact that a potential cue phrase is alone in its intermediate phrase
or first-in-phrase.

sentential uses, this speaker favored the Sentential A model slightly over Sentential
B, employing the former in 204 (56.8%) of cases. However, it is also possible that a
speaker might favor prosodic strategies that are specific to particular cue phrases to
convey that they are discourse or sentential. For example, from Table 10, we see that
most discourse uses of all coordinate conjunctions fit our prosodic model Discourse
B, while all occurrences of finally and further fit Discourse A. Of cue phrases classified

5.2 Distinguishing Discourse and Sentential Usage in Transcriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943142857143">
As in our previous studies, we also examined potential nonprosodic distinctions be-
tween discourse and sentential uses. Of the orthographic and syntactic features we
examined, we found presence or absence of preceding punctuation and part of speech
to be most successful in distinguishing discourse from sentential uses. We also exam-
ined how and when cue phrases occurred adjacent to other cue phrases. Although the
data are sparseâ€”only 118 (12.4%) of our tokens occurred adjacent to other cue phrases,
they suggest that co-occurrence data may provide information useful for cue phrase
disambiguation. In particular, of the 26 discourse usages of cue phrases preceded by
other classifiable cue phrases, 20 (76.9%) were also discourse usages. Similarly, out of
29 sentential usages preceded by a classified cue, 21(72.4%) were preceded by another
sentential use. With respect to classified cue phrases that were followed by other clas-
sified cue phrases, 20 out of 28 (71.4%) discourse usages were followed by a discourse
usage, while 21 out of 27 (77.8%) sentential usages were followed by other sentential
uses.
Table 11 presents the orthography found in the transcription of the cue phrases
present in the recorded speech. The orthographic markers used by the transcriber in-
clude commas, periods, dashes, and paragraph breaks. For the 843 tokens-536 judged
sentential and 307 judged discourseâ€”whose classification both judges agreed upon,
and excluding those items that the transcriber omitted, orthography or its absence
is a useful predictor of discourse or sentential use. In particular, of the 213 tokens
preceded by punctuation (combining rows one and three from Table 11), 176 (82.6%)
are discourse usages. Note, however, that many discourse usages are not marked by
preceding orthography; the 176 marked tokens represent only 57.3% of all discourse
uses in this sample. Only 37 (6.9%) of sentential usages were also preceded by ortho-
graphic indicators. Twelve tokens that are succeeded but not preceded by orthographic
markings are discourse and 21 are sentential. All of the tokens in RJB86 that are both
preceded and succeeded by orthography are discourse usages, although, again, these
25 tokens represent only 8.1% of the discourse tokens in the sample. So, the pres-
ence of preceding orthographic indicatorsâ€”especially in conjunction with succeeding
indicatorsâ€”appears to be a reliable textual indicator that a potential cue phrase should
be interpreted as a discourse use, predicting correctly in 176 (82.6%) cases. While we
found that discourse uses are not always reliably marked by such indicators in the
RJB86 transcription, it is possible to predict the discourse/sentential distinction from
orthography alone for this corpus in 675 (80.1%) cases.
In our study of now, described in Section 4.3, we found that in 51 (85%) cases, cue

phrases that were first in intonational phrase were marked orthographically. In the
current single-speaker study, first position in intonational phrase was orthographically
marked in only 199 of 429, or 46.4% of cases. So, in this study, the association between
position in intonational phrase and orthographic marking appears much weaker.
We also found that part of speech could be useful in distinguishing discourse from
sentential usageâ€”although less useful than orthographic cuesâ€”as shown in Table 12.7
If we simply predict discourse or sentential use by the assignment most frequently
associated with a given part of speech, Church&apos;s part-of-speech algorithm predicts
discourse or sentential use in 561 (63.9%) cases for tokens where both judges agreed
on discourse/sentential assignment. For example, we assume that since the majority
of conjunctions and verbs are judged sentential, these parts of speech are predictors of
sentential status, and, since most adverbials are associated with discourse uses, these
are predictors of discourse status, and so on.
If we employ both orthographic indicators and part of speech as predictors of
the discourse/sentential distinction, we achieve only slightly better prediction than
with orthographic cues alone. That is, if we consider both an item&apos;s part-of-speech
tag and adjacent orthographic indicators, we model the RJB86 data only marginally
more accurately. Table 13 models correctly 677 (80.3%) transcribed, classified tokens
in RJB86 from orthographic and part-of-speech information. For example, given a
coordinating conjunction, our model would predict that it would be a discourse use if
preceded by orthography, and a sentential use otherwise. In fact, the only difference
from orthography alone is the way succeeding orthography can signal a discourse use
for a singular or mass noun, and a sentential use for adverbs.
While the use of orthographic and part-of-speech data represents only a fractional
improvement over orthographic information alone, it is possible that, since the latter
is not subject to transcriber idiosyncracy, such an approach may prove more reliable
than orthography alone in the general case. And, for text-to-speech applications, it

5.3 Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941043478261">
Our findings for our single-speaker multi-cue phrase study support the intonational
model of discourse/sentential characteristics of cue phrases that we proposed based
on our earlier multispeaker single-cue phrase studies of now and well (Hirschberg
and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990). In each study, discourse uses of cue
phrases fit one of two prosodic models: in one, the cue phrase was set apart as a
separate intermediate phrase, possibly with other cue phrases; in the other, the cue
phrase was first-in-phrase, possibly preceded by other cue phrases, and either was
deaccented or bore a L* pitch accent. Sentential uses also fit one of two prosodic
models: in both, they were part of a larger intermediate phrase. In one model, they
were first-in-phrase and bore a H* or complex pitch accentâ€”thus distinguishing them
from discourse uses that were first-in-phrase. In the other, they were not first-in-phrase
and bore any type pitch accent.
The association between discourse/sentential models and discourse/sentential
judgments for this study, as for our previous studies of now and well, is significant
at the .001 level. However, for the single-speaker, multi-cue phrase data in RJB86,
our prosodic models successfully classified only 662 tokens (75.4%), a considerably
smaller proportion than for the previous studies. We found one major reason for the
poorer performance of our models on the multi-cue phrase data. A large percentage
of the tokens that do not fit our prosodic models were coordinate conjunctions. When
these are removed from our sample, our prosodic models correctly classify 442 tokens
(85.3% of the data). It is also worth noting that coordinate conjunctions were among
the most difficult cue phrases to classify as discourse or sentential.

uses, we made a more general examination of the set of items that we were unable
to classify. In addition to the finding that conjunctions were difficult to classify (61
tokens, representing 81.3% of the tokens in RJB86 that we were unable to agree on
a classification for), we also found that certain prosodic configurations appeared to
make tokens more or less difficult to classify. Of the 75 unclassified tokens for RJB86, 55
(73.3%) were tokens of Discourse Model B or Sentential Model A. Recall that Discourse
Model B identifies items that are first-in-phrase and are deaccented or bear a L* pitch
accent; Sentential Model A identifies items that are also first-in-phrase but bear a H*
or complex pitch accent. Discourse Model A, items that are alone in intermediate
phrase, and Sentential Model B, items that are not first-in-phrase, appear easier to
classify. Thus, it appears that prosodic configurations that are distinguished solely
by differences in pitch accent, rather than upon differences in phrasing and position
within a phrase, may be less useful indicators of the discourse/sentential distinction.
Furthermore, we found that orthographic cues (from transcription) successfully
disambiguate between discourse and sentential usage in 675 cases (80.1% of the 843).
Part of speech was less successful in distinguishing discourse from sentential use,
disambiguating only 561 cases in the study (63.9% of 878). Using both orthography
and part of speech for predicting the discourse/sentential distinction in our corpus
was nearly equivalent to using orthography alone, predicting 677 (80.3% of 843) cases
correctly. The relationship between the orthography of transcription and the orthog-
raphy of written text will be an important determinant of whether orthography alone
can be used for prediction in text-to-speech applications; if the latter is less useful,
part-of-speech may provide additional power.

6. Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998008">
In this paper, we have examined the problem of disambiguating cue phrases in both
text and speech. We have presented results of several analyses of cue phrase usage in
corpora of recorded, transcribed speech, in which we examined a number of text-based
and prosodic features to find which best predicted a discourse/sentential distinction.
Based on these studies, we have proposed an intonational model for cue phrase dis-
ambiguation in speech, based on intonational phrasing and pitch accent, and a model
for cue phrase disambiguation in text, based on orthographic indicators and part-of-
speech information.
Work on the meanings associated with particular intonational features, such as
phrasing and pitch accent type, provides an explanation for the different prosodic
configurations associated with discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases. As we
have demonstrated above, discourse uses of cue phrases fit one of two models. In
one model, Discourse Model A, discourse uses are set apart as separate intermediate
phrases. Recall from Section 3 that intonational phrasing can serve to divide speech
into units of information, for purposes such as scope disambiguation. So, a broader
discourse scope for a cue phrase may be signalled by setting it apart from other items
that it might potentially modify if interpreted more narrowly. That is, in an utterance
such as Now let&apos;s talk about cue phrases, now may be more likely to be interpreted in its
discourse sense if it is physically set apart from the verb it might otherwise modify in
its sentential guise.
We have also seen that a discourse cue phrase may be part of a larger intermedi-
ate phrase and deaccented or given a L* pitch accentâ€”Discourse Model B. While the
absence of a pitch accent generally tends to convey that an item represents old infor-
mation or is inferrable in the discourse, deaccenting is also frequently associated with
function wordsâ€”prepositions, pronouns, and articles. Cue phrases in the deaccented

subset of Discourse Model B may, like function words, be seen as conveying structural
information, rather than contributing to the semantic content of an utterance. The al-
ternative version of Discourse Model B, in which a cue phrase that is part of a larger
phrase receives a L* pitch accent, might be understood in terms of the interpretation
proposed by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990) for the L* accent. In this account,
the L* accent is analyzed as conveying that an item is salient in the discourse, but for
some reason should not be added to speaker and hearer&apos;s mutual belief space. This
subset of Discourse Model B cue phrases may thus be analyzed as conveying salient
information about the discourse, but not adding to the semantic content of speaker
and hearer&apos;s beliefs.
The text-based and prosodic models of cue phrases we have proposed from our
studies of particular cue phrases spoken by multiple speakers, and of multiple cue
phrases spoken by a single speaker, have both practical and theoretical import. From a
practical point of view, the construction of both text-based and prosodic models permit
improvement in the generation of synthetic speech from unrestricted text. From our
text based model, we know when to convey a discourse or a sentential use of a given
cue phrase. From our prosodic model, we know how to convey such a distinction.
These distinctions have in fact been implemented in a new version of the Bell Labs
Text-to-Speech System (Sproat, Hirschberg, and Yarowsky 1992). From a theoretical
point of view, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of cue phrase disambiguation
in both text and speech and provide a model for how that disambiguation might be
accomplished. These results strengthen the claim that the discourse structures crucial to
computational models of interaction, in this case, certain lexical indicators of discourse
structure, can indeed be identified.

<abstract confidence="0.976698157894737">phrases are linguistic expressions such as now and function as explicit indicators of structure of a discourse. For example, signal the beginning of a subtopic or a return a previous topic, while mark subsequent material as a response to prior material, or as an explanatory comment. However, while cue phrases may convey discourse structure, each also one or more alternate uses. While be used sententially as an adverbial, for example, the discourse use initiates a digression. Although distinguishing discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases is critical to the interpretation and generation of discourse, the question of how speakers and hearers accomplish this disambiguation is rarely addressed. This paper reports results of empirical studies on discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases, in which both text-based and prosodic features were examined for disambiguating power. Based on these studies, it is proposed that discourse versus sentential usage may be distinguished by intonational features, specifically, pitch accent and prosodic phrasing. A prosodic model that characterizes these distinctions is identified. This model is associated with features identifiable from text analysis, including orthography and part of speech, to permit the application of the results of the prosodic analysis to the generation of appropriate intonational features for discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases in synthetic speech. phrases, and phrases that directly signal the structure of a discourse, been variously termed words, discourse markers, discourse connectives, particles the computational linguistic and conversational analysis</abstract>

On the other hand, noncohesive uses, which we would characterize as sentential, tend to be of nonreduced, accented forms. So, perhaps it is the intonational information present in speech, but missing generally in transcription, which aids hearers in disambiguating between discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases. Empirical evidence from more general studies of the intonational characteristics of word classes tends to support this possibility. Studies of portions of the Londonâ€”Lund corpus such as Altenberg (1987) have provided intonational profiles of word classes including discourse items, conjunctions and adverbials that are roughly compatible with the notion that cue phrases tend to be deaccented, 505 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 although the notion of discourse item used in this study is quite restrictive.1 However, while the instance of now in Example 6 is in fact reduced, as Halliday and Hassan (1976) propose, that in Example 10, while interpreted as a discourse use, is nonetheless clearly intonationally prominent. Furthermore, both of the nows in Example 5 are also prominent. S</context>

Our results provide empirical evidence suggesting how hearers and readers may distinguish between discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases. More generally, our findings can be seen as a case study demonstrating the importance of intonational information to language understanding and generation. In Section 2 we review previous work on cue phrases and discuss the general problem of distinguishing between discourse and sentential uses. In Section 3 we introduce the theory of English intonation adopted for our prosodic analysis (Pierrehumbert 1980; Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986). In Section 4 we present our initial empirical studies, which focus on the analysis of the cue phrases now and well in multispeaker spontaneous speech. In Section 5 we demonstrate that these results generalize to other cue phrases, presenting results of a larger and more comprehensive study: an examination of all cue phrases produced by a single speaker in a 75-minute presentation. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss the theoretical and practical applications of our findings. 2.

An intonational phrase is composed of one of more intermediate phrases, plus a boundary tone. Boundary tones may be high (H%) or low (L%) also, and fall exactly at the edge of the intonational phrase. So, each intonational phrase ends with a phrase accent and a boundary tone. A given sentence may be uttered with considerable variation in phrasing. For example, the utterance in Figure 2 was produced as a single intonational phrase, whereas in Figure 5 now is set off as a separate phrase. Intuitively, prosodic phrases divide an utterance into meaningful &amp;quot;chunks&amp;quot; of information (Bolinger 1989). Variation in phrasing can change the meaning hearers assign to tokens of a given sentence. For example, the interpretation of a sentence like Bill doesn&apos;t drink because he&apos;s unhappy is likely to change, depending upon whether it is uttered as one phrase or two. Uttered as a single phrase, this sentence is commonly interpreted as conveying that Bill does indeed drinkâ€”but the cause of his drinking is not his unhappiness. Uttered as two phrases (Bill doesn&apos;t drinkâ€”because he&apos;s unhappy), it is more likely to convey that Bill does not drinkâ€”and the reason for his abstinence is his unhappiness. In</context>

Our model is based on several empirical studies (Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990): two studies of individual cue phrases in which we develop our model, and a more comprehensive study of cue phrases as a class, in which we confirm and expand our model. Before describing these studies and their results, we must first describe the intonational features examined in our analyses. 3. Phrasing and Accent in English The importance of intonational information to the communication of discourse structure has been recognized in a variety of studies (Butterworth 1975; Schegloff 1979; Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns 1980; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990; Silverman 1987). However, just which intonational features are important and how they communicate discourse information is not well understood. Prerequisite, however, to addressing these issues is the adoption of a framework of intonational description to identify which intonational features will be examined and how they will be characterized. For the studies discussed below, we have adopted Pierrehumbert&apos;s (1980) theory of English intonation, which we will describe briefl</context>

In fact, the only difference from orthography alone is the way succeeding orthography can signal a discourse use for a singular or mass noun, and a sentential use for adverbs. While the use of orthographic and part-of-speech data represents only a fractional improvement over orthographic information alone, it is possible that, since the latter is not subject to transcriber idiosyncracy, such an approach may prove more reliable than orthography alone in the general case. And, for text-to-speech applications, it 7 The part-of-speech tagger employed in this analysis (Church 1988) uses a subset of the part-of-speech tags used in Francis and Kut&apos;era (1982).

However, such analysis is often beyond the capabilities of current natural language processing systems. Many domains are also not task-oriented. Additionally, cue phrases are widely used in the identification of rhetorical relations among portions of a text or discourse (Hobbs 1979; Mann and Thompson 1983; Reichman 1985), and have been claimed in general to reduce the complexity of discourse processing and to increase textual coherence in natural language processing systems (Cohen 1984; Litman and Allen 1987; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986). Previous attempts to characterize the set of cue phrases in the linguistic and in the computational literature have typically been extensional, with each cue phrase or set of phrases associated with one or more discourse or conversational functions. In the linguistic literature, cue phrases have been the subject of a number of theoretical and descriptive corpus-based studies that emphasize the diversity of meanings associated with cue phrases as a class, within an overarching framework of function such as discourse cohesiveness or conversatio</context>

Results of a pilot study of this corpus are reported in Litman and Hirschberg (1990). We limited ourselves here to the examination of single lexical items, since the hypothesis we had previously developed applies only to such items; e.g., it would be meaningless to ask whether a larger phrase bears a pitch accent or not. The corpus consisted of a keynote address given from notes by Ronald Brachman at the First International Conference on Expert Database Systems in 1986. This talk yielded 953 tokens, based upon a set of possible cue phrases derived from Cohen (1984), Grosz and Sidner (1986), Litman and Hirschberg (1990), Reichman (1985), Schiffrin (1987), Warner (1985), and Zuckerman and Pearl (1986). The frequency distribution of the tokens is shown in Table 5. By far the most frequent cue phrase occurring in our corpus is the conjunction and, representing 320 (33.6%) tokens. The next most frequent item is now, with only 69 occurrences. Other items occurring more than 50 times each in the corpus are but, like, or, and so. Note that there are 444 conjunctionsâ€”and, but, and orâ€”comprising nearly half of the cue phrases in our corpus. In addition to the ite</context>

The fact that conjunctions account for a large number of the ambiguities we found in the corpus and the disagreements we had about classification is not surprising when we note that the discourse meanings of conjunction as described in the literature (see Table 14) seem to be quite similar to the meanings of sentential conjunction. For example, the discourse use of and is defined as &apos;parallelism&apos; in Cohen (1984), &apos;a marker of addition&apos; or &apos;sequential continuity&apos; in Schriffin (1987), and &apos;conjunction&apos; in Warner (1985).

Alternatively, Cohen (1984) adopts a taxonomy of connectives based on Quirk (1972) to assign each class of cue phrase a function in her model of argument understanding. Grosz and Sidner (1986), in their tripartite model of discourse structure, classify cue phrases based on the changes they signal to the attentional and intentional states. Zukerman (1986) presents a taxonomy of cue phrases based on three functions in the generation of tutorial explanations: knowledge organization, knowledge acquisition, and affect maintenance. Table 14 in the Appendix compares the characterization of items classed as cue phrases in a number of these classification schemes.

Results of a pilot study of this corpus are reported in Litman and Hirschberg (1990). We limited ourselves here to the examination of single lexical items, since the hypothesis we had previously developed applies only to such items; e.g., it would be meaningless to ask whether a larger phrase bears a pitch accent or not. The corpus consisted of a keynote address given from notes by Ronald Brachman at the First International Conference on Expert Database Systems in 1986. This talk yielded 953 tokens, based upon a set of possible cue phrases derived from Cohen (1984), Grosz and Sidner (1986), Litman and Hirschberg (1990), Reichman (1985), Schiffrin (1987), Warner (1985), and Zuckerman and Pearl (1986). The frequency distribution of the tokens is shown in Table 5. By far the most frequent cue phrase occurring in our corpus is the conjunction and, representing 320 (33.6%) tokens. The next most frequent item is now, with only 69 occurrences. Other items occurring more than 50 times each in the corpus are but, like, or, and so.

Without such discourse segmentation, the incorrect potential antecedents might have been preferred, given their surface proximity and number agreement with the pronoun in question. Note that without cue phrases as explicit indicators of this topic structure, one would have to infer the relationships among discourse segments by appeal to a more detailed analysis of the semantic content of the passage. For example, in task-oriented dialogs, plan-based knowledge could be used to assist in the recognition of discourse structure (Grosz 1977). However, such analysis is often beyond the capabilities of current natural language processing systems. Many domains are also not task-oriented. Additionally, cue phrases are widely used in the identification of rhetorical relations among portions of a text or discourse (Hobbs 1979; Mann and Thompson 1983; Reichman 1985), and have been claimed in general to reduce the complexity of discourse processing and to increase textual coherence in natural language processing systems (Cohen 1984; Litman and Allen 1987; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986).

Thus, surface position alone appears inadequate to distinguish between discourse and sentential usage. However, when we listen to examples such as Example 10, we have little difficulty in identifying a discourse meaning for now. Similarly, the potentially troublesome case cited in Example 6 is easily disambiguated when one listens to the recording itself. What is missing from transcription that helps listeners to make such distinctions easily? Halliday and Hassan (1976, p. 268) note that their class of continuatives, which includes items such as now, of course, well, anyway, surely, and after all (i.e., items also commonly classed as cue phrases), vary intonationally with respect to cohesive function. In particular, continuatives are often &amp;quot;reduced&amp;quot; intonationally when they function &amp;quot;cohesively&amp;quot; to relate one part of a text to another (i.e., in their discourse use), unless they are &amp;quot;very definitely contrastive&amp;quot;; that is, continuatives are unaccented, with reduced vowel forms, unless they are marked as unusually prominent intonationally.

Empirical evidence from more general studies of the intonational characteristics of word classes tends to support this possibility. Studies of portions of the Londonâ€”Lund corpus such as Altenberg (1987) have provided intonational profiles of word classes including discourse items, conjunctions and adverbials that are roughly compatible with the notion that cue phrases tend to be deaccented, 505 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 although the notion of discourse item used in this study is quite restrictive.1 However, while the instance of now in Example 6 is in fact reduced, as Halliday and Hassan (1976) propose, that in Example 10, while interpreted as a discourse use, is nonetheless clearly intonationally prominent. Furthermore, both of the nows in Example 5 are also prominent. So it would seem that intonational prominence alone is insufficient to disambiguate between sentential and discourse uses. In this paper we present a more complex model of intonational features and textbased features that can serve to disambiguate between sentential and discourse instances of cue phrases.

Before describing these studies and their results, we must first describe the intonational features examined in our analyses. 3. Phrasing and Accent in English The importance of intonational information to the communication of discourse structure has been recognized in a variety of studies (Butterworth 1975; Schegloff 1979; Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns 1980; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Pier</context>

In the studies described below, we examined each of these features, in addition to text-based features, to see which best predicted cue phrase disambiguation, and to look for associations among text-based and intonational features. 4. Single Cue Phrase Studies Our first study of cue phrase disambiguation investigated multispeaker usage of the cue phrase now in a recorded, transcribed radio call-in program (Hirschberg and Litman 1987). Our corpus consisted of four days of the radio call-in program &amp;quot;The Harry Gross Show: Speaking of Your Money,&amp;quot; recorded during the week of February 1, 1982 (Pollack, Hirschberg, and Webber 1982). In this Philadelphia program, Gross offered financial advice to callers; for the February 3 show, he was joined by an accountant friend, Fred Levy. The four shows provided approximately ten hours of conversation between expert(s) and callers. The corpus was transcribed by Martha Pollack and Julia Hirschberg in 1982, in connection with another study. We chose now for this initial study for several re</context>

Thus, 82% of nows might be orthographically distinguished. We will have more to say on the role of orthography in disambiguating cue phrases in connection with the study described in Section 5. 4.4 Multispeaker Study of Well Based on the findings of our study of now, we proposed that listeners may use prosodic information to disambiguate discourse from sentential uses of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1987). However, although we chose to study now for its ambiguity between 515 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3 discourse and sentential (temporal adverbial) uses, it may of course also be seen as representative of sense ambiguities between temporals and nontemporals or deictics and nondeictics. Thus, if indeed our findings generalize, it might be to a class we had not intended to investigate. To discover further evidence that our results did indeed apply to the discourse/sentential use disambiguation, we conducted another multispeaker study, this time of the discourse and sentential use</context>

In each study, discourse uses of cue phrases fit one of two prosodic models: in one, the cue phrase was set apart as a separate intermediate phrase, possibly with other cue phrases; in the other, the cue phrase was first-in-phrase, possibly preceded by other cue phrases, and either was deaccented or bore a L* pitch accent. Sentential uses also fit one of two prosodic models: in both, they were part of a larger intermediate phrase.

Furthermore, both of the nows in Example 5 are also prominent. So it would seem that intonational prominence alone is insufficient to disambiguate between sentential and discourse uses. In this paper we present a more complex model of intonational features and textbased features that can serve to disambiguate between sentential and discourse instances of cue phrases. Our model is based on several empirical studies (Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990): two studies of individual cue phrases in which we develop our model, and a more comprehensive study of cue phrases as a class, in which we confirm and expand our model. Before describing these studies and their results, we must first describe the intonational features examined in our analyses. 3. Phrasing and Accent in English The importance of intonational information to the communication of discourse structure has been recognized in a variety of studies (Butterworth 1975; Schegloff 1979; Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns 1980; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990</context>

However, although we had shown that two cue phrases appeared to pattern similarly in this respect, we had still not demonstrated that our model could be extended to cue phrases in general. To address this larger issue, we next conducted a single-speaker multi-cue phrase study. 5. The Single-Speaker/Multi-Cue Phrase Study In this study, we examined all cue phrases consisting of a single lexical item that were produced by one speaker during 75 minutes, approximately 12,500 words, of recorded speech. Results of a pilot study of this corpus are reported in Litman and Hirschberg (1990). We limited ourselves here to the examination of single lexical items, since the hypothesis we had previously developed applies only to such items; e.g., it would be meaningless to ask whether a larger phrase bears a pitch accent or not. The corpus consisted of a keynote address given from notes by Ronald Brachman at the First International Conference on Expert Database Systems in 1986. This talk yielded 953 tokens, based upon a set of possible cue phrases derived from Cohen (1984), Grosz and Sidner (1986), Litman and Hirschberg (1990), Reichman (1985), Schiffrin (1987), Warner (1985), and Zu</context>

In each study, discourse uses of cue phrases fit one of two prosodic models: in one, the cue phrase was set apart as a separate intermediate phrase, possibly with other cue phrases; in the other, the cue phrase was first-in-phrase, possibly preceded by other cue phrases, and either was deaccented or bore a L* pitch accent. Sentential uses also fit one of two prosodic models: in both, they were part of a larger intermediate phrase. In one model, they were first-in-phrase and bore a H* or complex pitch accentâ€”thus distinguishing them from discourse uses that were first-in-phrase. In the other,</context>

Before describing these studies and their results, we must first describe the intonational features examined in our analyses. 3. Phrasing and Accent in English The importance of intonational information to the communication of discourse structure has been recognized in a variety of studies (Butterworth 1975; Schegloff 1979; Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns 1980; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990; Silverman 1987). However, just which intonational features are important and how they communicate discourse information is not well understood. Prerequisite, however, to addressing these issues is the adoption of a framework of intonational description to identify which intonational features will be examined and how they will be characterized. For the studies discussed below, we have adopted Pierrehumbert&apos;s (1980) theory of English intonation, which we will describe briefly below. In Pierrehumbert&apos;s phonological description of English, intonational contours, or tunes, are described as sequen</context>

L* accents occur much lower in the speaker&apos;s pitch range than H* and are phonetically realized as local FO minima. The accent on now in Figure 3 is a L*. Figure 4 shows a version of the sentence in Figures 1-3 with a L+H* accent on the first instance of now. Note that there is a peak on now (H*)â€”as there was in Figure 2â€”but now a striking valley (L) occurs just before this peak.

In particular, it is claimed that speakers use H* accents to indicate that an item represents new information, which should be added to their mutual belief space. For example, standard declarative utterances in English commonly involve H* accents. L* accents, on the other h</context>

Cue phrases in the deaccented 526 Julia Hirschberg and Diane Litman Disambiguation of Cue Phrases subset of Discourse Model B may, like function words, be seen as conveying structural information, rather than contributing to the semantic content of an utterance. The alternative version of Discourse Model B, in which a cue phrase that is part of a larger phrase receives a L* pitch accent, might be understood in terms of the interpretation proposed by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990) for the L* accent. In this account, the L* accent is analyzed as conveying that an item is salient in the discourse, but for some reason should not be added to speaker and hearer&apos;s mutual belief space. This subset of Discourse Model B cue phrases may thus be analyzed as conveying salient information about the discourse, but not adding to the semantic content of speaker and hearer&apos;s beliefs.

L+H accents are defined in terms of the evocation of a scale, defined as a partially ordered set following (Hirschberg 1991): L*+H accents, often associated with the conveyance of uncertainty or of incredulity, evoke a scale but predicate nothing of the accented item with respect to the mutual belief space; L+H* accents, commonly associated with contrastive stress, also evoke a scale but do add information about the accented item to speaker and hearer&apos;s mutual belief space (Pierrehumbert and Steele 1987; Hirschberg and Ward 1992). Another intonational feature that is considered in our study of cue phrases is prosodic phrasing. There are two levels of such phrasing in Pierrehumbert&apos;s theory, the intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase, a smaller sub-unit. A well-formed intermediate phrase consists of one or more pitch accents plus a high (H) or low (L) phrase accent. The phrase accent controls the pitch between the last pitch accent of the current intermediate phrase and the beginning of the nextâ€”or the end of the utterance.

Our results provide empirical evidence suggesting how hearers and readers may distinguish between discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases. More generally, our findings can be seen as a case study demonstrating the importance of intonational information to language understanding and generation. In Section 2 we review previous work on cue phrases and discuss the general problem of distinguishing between discourse and sentential uses. In Section 3 we introduce the theory of English intonation adopted for our prosodic analysis (Pierrehumbert 1980; Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986). In Section 4 we present our initial empirical studies, which focus on the analysis of the cue phrases now and well in multispeaker spontaneous speech. In Section 5 we demonstrate that these results generalize to other cue phrases, presenting results of a larger and more comprehensive study: an examination of all cue phrases produced by a single speaker in a 75-minute presentation.

Note that, while every lexical item in English has a lexically stressable syllable, which is the rhythmically most prominent syllable in the word, not every stressable syllable is in fact accented; so, lexical stress is distinguished from pitch accent. Lexical items that do bear pitch accents are said to be accented, while those not so marked are said to be deaccented.

Reichman (1985) and Hobbs (1979) associate groups of cue phrases with the rhetorical relations among segments of text that they signal; in these approaches, the cue phrase taxonomy is dependent upon the set of rhetorical relations assumed. Alternatively, Cohen (1984) adopts a taxonomy of connectives based on Quirk (1972) to assign each class of cue phrase a function in her model of argument understanding. Grosz and Sidner (1986), in their tripartite model of discourse structure, classify cue phrases based on the changes they signal to the attentional and intentional states.

For example, it has been shown that cue phrases can assist in the resolution of anaphora, by indicating the presence of a structural boundary or a relationship between parts of a discourse (Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985).

For example, in task-oriented dialogs, plan-based knowledge could be used to assist in the recognition of discourse structure (Grosz 1977). However, such analysis is often beyond the capabilities of current natural language processing systems. Many domains are also not task-oriented. Additionally, cue phrases are widely used in the identification of rhetorical relations among portions of a text or discourse (Hobbs 1979; Mann and Thompson 1983; Reichman 1985), and have been claimed in general to reduce the complexity of discourse processing and to increase textual coherence in natural language processing systems (Cohen 1984; Litman and Allen 1987; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986).

The question of cue phrase sense ambiguity has been noted in both the computational and the linguistic literature, although only cursory attention has been paid to how disambiguation might take place. A common assumption in the computational literature is that hearers can use surface position within a sentence or clause to distinguish discourse from sentential uses. In fact, most systems that recognize or generate cue phrases assume a canonical (usually first) position for discourse cue phrases within 504 Julia Hirschberg and Diane Litman Disambiguation of Cue Phrases the clause (Reichman 1985; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986). Schiffrin (1987) also assumes that discourse uses of cue phrases are utterance initial. However, discourse uses of cue phrases can in fact appear noninitially in a clause, as illustrated by the item say in Example 8 (RJB86). Example 8 However, if we took that language and added one simple operator which we called restriction which allowed us for example to form relational concepts like say, son and daughter, that is a child who is always male or is always female. Also, sentential usages can appear clause initially, as in Example 9 (RJB86). Example 9 We&apos;ve got to ge</context>

The corpus consisted of a keynote address given from notes by Ronald Brachman at the First International Conference on Expert Database Systems in 1986.

Our model is based on several empirical studies (Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990): two studies of individual cue phrases in which we develop our model, and a more comprehensive study of cue phrases as a class, in which we confirm and expand our model. Before describing these studies and their results, we must first describe the intonational features examined in our analyses. 3. Phrasing and Accent in English The importance of intonational information to the communication of discourse structure has been recognized in a variety of studies (Butterworth 1975; Schegloff 1979; Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns 1980; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990; Silverman 1987).
