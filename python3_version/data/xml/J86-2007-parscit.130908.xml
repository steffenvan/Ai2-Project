value to be a set of functions rather than just one. This is
a rather transparent trick to avoid saying that &amp;quot;adjunct&amp;quot;
occurs several times as an argument and the set of
ordered pairs is not, in fact, a function. Either we have
to do with something we might call a &amp;quot;near-function&amp;quot;, or
we have to reformulate the well-formedness rules.
Both of the books being reviewed are mainly devoted
to proving that this framework does not fall apart when
presented with certain standard problems. Horn&apos;s book
is less rigorous and closer to conventional linguistic theo-
ry. The main difference in the two theories seems to be
that Horn admits function predicates (that is, values of
the argument &amp;quot;predicate&amp;quot;) that are themselves functions
rather than atomic logical predicates. This is interesting
from the mental representation point of view and
deserves more discussion from that point of view than it
gets in either book.
Bresnan has collected a number of very competent
co-workers, most notably Ronald M. Kaplan, and Mental
Representation is a collection of different contributions
with a rather thin thread of continuity. Bresnan is the
author or co-author of six of the thirteen chapters. The
material is not restricted to English, and there are chap-
ters on French, Russian, Icelandic, and Malayalam. All
of the work is intended to prove applicability of the theo-
ry, rather than present the results of complete implemen-
tations.
Part III of Mental Representation is entitled &amp;quot;Cognitive
Processing of Grammatical Representations&amp;quot;; it contains
three chapters. &amp;quot;A Theory of the Acquisition of Lexical
Interpretive Grammars&amp;quot; by Steven Pinker discusses
acquisition by children. This reviewer admits to no long-
er being able to understand articles in this increasingly
specialized sub-field of linguistics. &amp;quot;A Competence-
Based Theory of Syntactic Closure&amp;quot; by Marilyn Ford,
Bresnan, and Kaplan is, to a computationally-oriented
linguist, the high point of the book. It contains a theory,
supported by experimental evidence, of how real people
analyze real utterances; and it ends up with a perfectly
feasible plan for computerization (in terms of Kaplan&apos;s
(1981) General Syntactic Processor) of lexical-functional
grammars. &amp;quot;Sentence Planning Units: Implications for
the Speaker&apos;s Representation of Meaningful Relaticths
Underlying Sentences&amp;quot; by Ford discusses production of
utterances and presents some valuable experimental data.
It is not possible, of course, in a review to do anything
like justice to the wealth of detail in either of these
books. For example, Horn systematically compares his
English analysis with a parallel analysis of Polish. In fact,
all of the authors wrestle with the problem of free word
order and seem to achieve victories. In a chapter on
&amp;quot;Control and Complementation&amp;quot;, Bresnan tackles word
order and even worse problems with some success. The
language-specific chapters contain much of value that
cannot be discussed here; and so on.
Lexical-functional grammar appears to be flourishing,
but it has not swept away all the other schools of
thought. Still other alternatives can be visualized. For
example, we might question the asymmetry between
phonology and semantics, and change the model to place
them on a common basis. We might use phrase structure
and lexicon to generate something called &amp;quot;deep
structure&amp;quot; and two sets of descriptions, one on each side,
to be solved.
Horn tries to formulate the construction of functional
structures with something very like transformations rath-
er than the arrow formalism. It is true, in an empty way,
that every mapping of this kind is a transformation. But
the process of solving the description wreaks havoc with
conventional simplicity metrics. It is not, of course, fash-
ionable any longer to mention simplicity metrics, but a
glance at the argumentation procedures of any theoretical
linguist will disclose that they are alive and well, if never
acknowledged. Theoretical linguists choose, continually,
between models on the basis of what mathematicians call
elegance. This is unobjectionable because it is simply
another version of Occam&apos;s Razor; but mathematicians
live in a world where anything, notationally speaking,
goes. Linguists have been, generally speaking, captive to
their notational devices. It may well be that the most
valuable contribution of lexical-functional grammar is to
introduce the implicit function theorem into linguistics.
