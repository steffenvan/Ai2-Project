In spite of the recent shift of interest of the computational linguistics community to
statistical approaches to NLP, the role of commonsense reasoning in semantic and
pragmatic processing remains strong. Traditionally, it has been the commonsense rea-
soning community, and, in particular, the nonmonotonic reasoning community, that
have considered linguistic applications of reasoning; however, these researchers do not
go all the way to demonstrate how their formalisms can be implemented as algorithms
that would enhance the quality of a particular NLP system.
Regrettably, most commercial search systems do not rely on commonsense rea-
soning, and as a result it is difficult to access a relevant piece of information if the
user is not familiar with domain-specific terms. Furthermore, it is not yet possible to
find information on the World Wide Web that is related to a query only by common
sense. Erik Mueller’s book Commonsense Reasoning is a substantial step towards making
commonsense reasoning formalisms usable for semantic processing, and it can be used
as a good manual on how to enable an ontology to reason about events. Such logical
AI notions as fluent, inertia, pre-condition and effect, nonmonotonicity, circumscription, and
others are well explained and illustrated, so that the respective use cases for linguistic
information processing become transparent.
The main question that the book addresses is how to automate commonsense
reasoning. The focus of the book is event calculus, which is important, in particular,
for answering questions about sequences of actions, augmenting semantic rules and
domain ontologies by the event-handling components in question answering, annota-
tion, information extraction, and machine translation systems. The use of the described
technique can be straightforward for declarative ontologies, especially those that are
logic programming–based. However, substantial design effort would be required to
implement these techniques in conventional object-oriented programming languages.
Hence this book is a good aid to prepare developers of ontologies and semantic rules
for the problems that they will certainly experience.
One of the main problems in presenting the formalisms of logical AI is that they
first impress the audience as solving rather trivial cases. It is only when a knowledge
engineer starts to implement basic reasoning features and runs into problems building
intuitively clear links between facts that he or she starts to appreciate the contribution of
commonsense logicians. Being defined by a limited number of first-order logic axioms,
event calculus enables a semantic system to reason about a wide range of real-world
problems. The book demonstrates that the symbolic approach can deliver elegant design
with provable properties. At the same time, logical AI would benefit from contributions
from linguists who, having read this book, would find graceful interpretations of com-
monsense formalisms.
Computational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 1
One of the important lessons learned by AI research is that some forms of
intellectual activity that we take for granted are extremely difficult to implement as
software. The current state-of-the-art AI system can hardly reach the complexity of
commonsense reasoning of an 18-month-old child. I believe that Mueller’s systematic
and thorough introduction to the world of the HoldsAt predicate will advance the
“mental age” of any CL systems that readers of the book design.
