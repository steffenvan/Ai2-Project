1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987357142857">
The study presented in this paper has been
designed to explore the current state of genre
evolution on the web through web users&apos;
perception. The web can be interpreted, among
other things, as a genre repertoire in evolution
because there are still many genre labels which
have not been consolidated and many web pages
that cannot be sorted into a recognized and
acknowledged genre. The interpretation of the
web as a genre repertoire in evolution has been
developed within a research project on automatic
identification of genre in web pages (Santini,
2006b). This interpretation is an attempt to
explain the high level of hybridism and
individualization of many web pages, which
result in classification intractability. The study
reported in this paper shows that humans have
the same problems as classification algorithms
when it comes to less standardized and
conventionalized web pages.
As it has often been pointed out (for example,
cf. Kwasnik and Crowston, 2005), it is hard to
pin down the concept of genre from a single
perspective or to find an agreed definition of
what genre is. This lack is also experienced in
the more restricted world of non-literary or non-
fictional genres, such as professional or
instrumental genres, where the variation due to
personal style is less pronounced than in literary
genres. In particular, scholars working with
practical genres focus upon a specific
environment. For instance Swales (1990)
develops his notion of genre in academic and
research settings, Bathia (1993) and Trosborg
(2000) in professional settings, Yates and
Orlikowsky (1992) within organizational
communication. Despite the lack of an agreed
theoretical notion, genre is a well-established
term (cf. Karlgren, 2004), intuitively understood
in its vagueness. Classifying documents by genre
is a common operation that humans perform with
more or less effort.

objects created to meet and streamline
communicative needs. These cultural objects
represent the role that a certain type of
documents plays in an environment. Each genre
shows a set of standardized or conventional
characteristics that makes it recognizable among
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999941272727273">
others, and this kind of identity raises specific
expectations in the recipients, despite the
fuzziness of genre labels (cf. Santini, 2005).
Being cultural objects, showing common
conventions and raising similar expectations are
unifying traits. Together with these, there is a
number of separating traits, such as hybridism,
individualization, and evolution. In fact, genres
are not mutually exclusive and different genres
can be merged in a single document, generating
hybrid forms. Genres are based on conventions,
but allow a certain freedom of variation and
consequently can be individualized.
Being artifacts, sharing conventions and
expectations, showing hybridism and
individualization, and undergoing evolution are
important traits characterizing all sorts of genres.
More precisely, genres can be defined as cultural
artifacts, i.e. objects linked to a culture, a society
or a community, bearing standardized features
(conventions) but leaving space for creativity
(individualization). On the one hand,
standardized and recurrent features induce
predictable expectations in the receivers. On the
other hand, the freedom allowed by creativity
allow genres to change, evolve, and be created to
meet new needs (genre evolution), especially
under the impulse of a new communication
medium. While the change is still ongoing, i.e.
before a modified genre is redefined, or a new
genre is identified with a new name, documents
show mixed forms and functions (genre
hybridism).
This view of genre is flexible enough to
encompass not only paper genres (both literary
and practical genres), but also digital genres and,
more specifically, web genres, such as the
personal home page. The personal home page
has no evident antecedent in the paper world (cf.
Dillon and Gushrowski, 2000). It sprang up on
the web as a new cultural object servicing the
community of web users. When browsing a
personal home page, web users expect a blend of
standardized information (self-narration,
personal interests, contact details, and often
pictures related to one&apos;s life) and personal touch.
Another important thing to notice is that
before genre conventions become fully
standardized, genres do not have an official
name. A genre name becomes acknowledged
when the genre itself has a role and a
communicative function in a community or
society (Gorlach, 2004: 9). Before this
acknowledgement, a genre shows hybrid or
individualized forms, and undefined functions.
For example, before 1998 web logs (or blogs)
were already present on the Web, but they were
not identified as a genre. They were just &amp;quot;web
pages&amp;quot;, with similar characteristics and
functions. In 1999, suddenly a community sprang
up using this new genre (Blood, 2000). Only at
this point, the genre label &amp;quot;web log&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot;
started spreading and being recognized.
Genre hybridism and individualization are
evident on the web, and play an important role in
the change and the creation of new genres. In
fact, web pages — which can be considered as a
new kind of document, much more unpredictable
and customized than paper documents (Santini,
2006a) — are often hybrid because of intra-genre
and inter-genre variations. They are also highly
individualized because of the creative freedom
provided by HTML or XML tags (the building
blocks of web pages) or programming languages
such as Javascript. On the web, new genres are
constantly added (blogs, clogs, eshops, wikis,
etc.) and traditional genres are adapted or
updated in order to include more or different
functionalities (online front pages, ezines, net
ads, etc.). Genres such as emails, newsletters,
search pages, eshops, etc. were a futuristic
prophecy only 10 or 15 years ago, while today
they belong to the normal life of a web user.
Presumably, other genres will soon be added to
meet new communicative needs brought about
by new technologies.
As any other evolutions, also genre evolution
proceeds along the axis of time. It is a diachronic
process. There must be a `before&apos; and an `after&apos;.
What often hallmarks a `before&apos; and an `after&apos; is
the introduction of a new communication
medium within a culture, a society, a community.
The added value of studying genres on the web
(a new medium) is represented by the possibility
of following the development of genres and
genres repertoires live, i.e. while it is taking
place, and not a posteriori. That is, on the web
we can capture synchronically a diachronic
process. From a synchronic point of view, the
genre repertoire is a continuum, where there are
three forces interacting: what we bring from the
past (reproduced genres), what is new or adapted
to the new environment (novel genres and
adapted genres), what is going to emerge and is
not fully formed yet (emerging genres).
This view of genre evolution complements
previous studies on the same subject (cf.
Crowston and Williams, 1997; Shepherd and
Watters, 1998; Kwasnik and Crowston, 2005).
The main contribution of the synchronic
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995179">
33
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962272727273">
continuum is that an additional force has been
acknowledged to take part in the evolution
process, i.e. emerging genres. Emerging genres
are those that are not fully standardized, that are
still in formation and for which a genre label has
not been created or have a label which is still
opaque to the majority of users. Currently many
web pages are in this phase of evolution,
showing a high level of hybridism or
individualization. We suggest that the subjects&apos;
perception of these web pages can be interpreted
in term of genre evolution.
The study reported in this paper provides a
snapshot of the current state of the genre
repertoire of web pages seen through the
perception of web users. Although this view is
partial (23 labels to be assigned to 25 web
pages), it offers an interesting section of the
genre repertoire on the web. This study can be
also seen as a confirmatory study, because it
confirms that a number of recent web genres,
unprecedented in the paper world (such as home
page, FAQs, blog) can be recognized by the
subjects; others have not fully emerged and
many web users are not familiar with their new
genre labels; finally some web pages show a high
level of ambiguity and web users largerly
disagree on assigning labels to them.
The article is organized as follows: Section 2
presents a short overview of previous work;
Section 3 describes the web study and presents
preliminary results; in Section 4 some
conclusions are drawn.

Previous Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981702702703">
No studies have been carried out so far on users&apos;
perception of a genre repertoire in transition.
Crowston and Williams (1997) were the first
who reported on the genre repertoire on the web.
They identified 48 reproduced and emergent
genres in a sample of about 1,000 web pages.
A few user studies were carried out with the
more pragmatic approach of exploring the
usefulness of genre to improve web searches and
defining a genre palette appropriate for this
purpose. The most comprehensive study related
to genre effectiveness for web searching is
recent. Rosso (2005) carried out a series of four
linked experiments, all based on human subjects.
Quite surprisingly, the conclusion drawn by the
author was that genre-annotated search results
produced no significant improvement in
participants&apos; ability to make more consistent or
faster assessment on the relevance of search
results (Rosso, 2005: 133-179). In fact, only 17
of 32 participants reported noticing the genre
label (Rosso, 2005: 176). Most probably, as
pointed out by the author, this outcome was
influenced by the difficulty and complexity of
the task, together with the limitations of the
setting (Rosso, 2005: 170-172).
Rosso&apos;s attempt to assess the relevance of
search results including genre labels was almost
unique. All other studies with web users, in
contrast, did not provide any assessment of how
well genres improved a web search. These
studies are more like surveys on users&apos;
preferences in terms of useful non-topical
categories that can help restrict web searches.
Along this line, Meyer zu Eissen and Stein
(2004) built a genre palette for the web using two
criteria: usability and feasibility. Their user study
was based on a questionnaire where they asked
about search engine use, usefulness of genre
classification, and usefulness of genre classes.
Interestingly, the authors note that one of the
inherent problems of genre classification is that
&amp;quot;even humans are not able to consistently specify
the genre of a given page&amp;quot; because web pages
have different functions, i.e. they might be
hybrid forms, as in the case of product
information sites that are combined with a
shopping interface.
Roussinov et al. (2001) carried out a
exploratory study of web users in order to
identify what genres they most/least frequently
come in contact with, and what genres most/least
address their information needs. In their study,
carried out in 2000, 116 different genres were
identified, but not all web pages could be
classified.
Karlgren (2000: 99 ff.), a pioneer in building a
genre palette, tried to collect genres that were
both consistent with what users expect as well as
conveniently computable. He sent around a
questionnaire where the core question was:
&amp;quot;What genres do you feel you find on the
WWW?&amp;quot;. He ended up with a palette of 11
genres. One frequent comment by the
respondents was that the genres in the palette
were not mutually exclusive, in other words they
showed some level of hybridism.
Very informative in many respects, these
studies have in common the practical aim of
improving web searches. This might explain why
they overlook difficult issues such as the
hybridism or the individualization of many web
pages, which are nonetheless perceived by the
subjects. The authors must necessarily focus on

unambiguous exemplars, showing clear-cut
conventions and expectations.
The present study, on the other hand, explores
the perception of genres when users are faced not
only with prototypical genre exemplars but also
with hybrid or individualized web pages, and
interpret the subjects&apos; perception in term of genre
evolution.

The expectation was that easy web genres would

be the most controversial in users&apos; perception.
The term &amp;quot;genre&amp;quot; was never mentioned in the
whole study in order not to influence or confuse
the participants. The goal of the study was not
declared either because the idea was to ask for a
genre classification of web pages implicitly and
study the reactions. Participants were simply told
to assign &amp;quot;labels&amp;quot; to web page &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;.

The task of participants was straightforward.

through the whole study and provided valid recognition pattern was mostly confirmed in the
responses for the experiment. top range, but slightly reshuffled in the middle
and bottom ranges. Figure 1 shows the charted
percentages.
Fisher&apos;s Exact Test. The percentages at the
bottom row in Table 2 can be interpreted in
terms of conditional distribution on the most
voted label (response variable) per web page
type (explanatory variable). In other words, they
refer to the sample distribution of most voted
labels, conditional to the web page type. In terms
of association, this means that the distribution of
the response variable (the label) changes with the
value of the explanatory variable (the web page
type) if the two variables are related. Table 2
suggests the existence of an association or
correlation between the label and the web page
to which this label was assigned. But as Table 2
refers to the sample rather than the population, it
provides evidence but not the final answer to
whether labels and web page types are associated
in the way suggested by the percentages. In order
to see if it is plausible that labels and web page
types are associated in the population, Fisher&apos;s
exact test can be calculated. The value returned
for this test by 5P55 is 9292.275, which is large
enough to reject the hypothesis that labels and
web page are independent2. This statistically
significant association shows that the web pages
chosen by the author to represent some web
genres mostly map the subjects&apos; perception of
these web pages. It also shows that many genre
labels are acknowledged by the users and are
consistently associated to web pages.

<figureCaption confidence="0.898829578947368">
Adjusted Residuals: A test statistic, such as
Fisher&apos;s exact test, and statistical significance
summarize the strength of evidence against the
null hypothesis of independence, but does not
indicate how many and which cells deviate
greatly from this hypothesis. Residuals, i.e. the
differences between expected and observed cell
frequencies can help in this task. In particular,
adjusted residuals can indicate if the cell counts
are significantly different from what
independence predicts. A large adjusted residual
provides evidence against independence of a cell.
As Table 3 mostly maps Table 2, a significant
association between genre labels and web page
types on the cells containing the most voted
labels is then confirmed.
3.4 Results
Currently, there is no standard test largely agreed
upon that can be used for experiments where
subjects can make choices from a large number
of categories (23 labels) for a large number of
objects (25 web pages). In the following
paragraphs some views and interpretations of the
data are presented, namely raw counts and
percentages, Fisher&apos;s exact test, and adjusted
residuals.
Raw Counts and Percentages. A view on the
data is offered in Table 2, which shows the
number of subjects assigning a particular label to
a particular web page and the percentage of the
most voted label. For example, the label eshop
(8th row) was assigned to WP11 (first column) by
119 subjects (highlighted cell), which
corresponds to 88.15% (bottom row). Four
subjects thought that WP1 was a corporate home
pages (around 2.9%), seven selected net ad
(around 5%), one subject chose front page
(around 0.7%), one hotlist, one did not know, two

<bodyText confidence="0.970334103448276">
added a new label for it (around 1. 4%).
Three ranges of agreement can be identified
out of this table. The top range includes web
pages with a percentage of agreement above
80%; the middle range groups web pages with an
agreement between 79% and 50%; finally the
bottom range contains web pages with an
agreement between 49 % and 20%. Table 1 lists
the web pages by percentage of agreement.
From these ranges a first conclusion can be
drawn. According to the ranges shown in Table
1, participants show the highest agreement on
what we selected as &amp;quot;easy web genres&amp;quot;, except in
three cases: front pages, net ad and splash screen,
which seem among the least agreed upon (see
bottom range). The middle range includes most
of the ambiguous web genres together with
ezine, which was deemed to be difficult by the
author. The bottom range includes the rest of the
ambiguous genres, together with other difficult
web pages and three web pages from the top
range, webpage_type_04 (front page),
webpage_type_24 (splash screen) and
webpage_type_25 (net ad).
We have now a first picture of users&apos;
perception of some web pages in relation to some
web genre labels. The hypothesized genre

3.5 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986847222222">
The original impression that there were different
degree of perception of genres of web pages was
confirmed by these preliminary results. Also the
rough distinction into three levels of genre
awareness (easy, ambiguous and difficult) was
confirmed. Three ranges of perception came out
clearly from percentages, but the distribution of
the web pages into these three ranges is slightly
different from what was expected.
The general view of the results (Fisher&apos;s test)
reveals that there is a significant association
between the 25 web pages and the 23 labels. The
analysis of adjusted residuals support this
interpretation.
The agreement among subjects on the label to
assign to a particular web pages can be divided
into three levels.
At the first level, which can be interpreted as
the highest perception of web genres, there are
web pages labelled as personal home page
(webpage_type_02), eshop (webpage_type_01),
corporate home page (webpage_type_11), FAQs
(webpage_type_12), and search pages
(webpage_type_05). We can define these labels
as stable web genres.
At a middle level of perception, there are web
genres still emerging. Most of the labels are
fairly novel (ezine, clog, blog, about, how to),
sometimes not entirely transparent, and some of
them are specialized (academic home page,
organizational home page, online tutorial).
Probably the textual conventions of these genres
are not entirely standardized yet and can cause
oscillation in users&apos; perception. This level offers
the most interesting view on a genre repertoire
which is moving and evolving and it is not
consolidated yet.
The bottom range shows a blurred level of
perception for different reasons. For some genres
such as email and newsletter, the presentation in
form of screenshots was not ideal. Subjects could
not navigate through the web page and they
could not resolve the level of granularity. For
instance, for webpage_type_03 (the web page
selected by the author to represent an email), 66
subjects chose email, but 3 4 subjects preferred to
add a new label for it and 20 thought it was an
about page. Surprisingly, labels such as splash
screen and front page for webpage_type_04 and
webpage_type_24 were not favoured by the
respondents who preferred to add their own
labels in many cases. For webpage_type_06,
subjects preferred the label search page instead
of sitemap. Another interesting case is net ad
(webpage_type_25), which was often assessed as
eshop, probably because the concept of
advertising and selling are closely related. The
most opaque label seems to be hotlist
(webpage_type_15) because most subject
preferred to add their own label. Three of the
four web pages that were classified by the author
as &amp;quot;I don&apos;t know&amp;quot; belong to this level of
perception. While webpage_type_21 fell into the
middle range because most of the subjects
perceive it as a search page, the genre perception
or interpretation of webpage_type_17,
webpage_type_18, and webpage_type_23 is not
so straightforward. For instance,
webpage_type_17 was assessed as online form
(57 subjects), search page (26 subjects), an eshop
(26 subjects) and probably it is has all these
functions at the same.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965606060606">
The study shows a composite picture of the
perception of the genre repertoire on the Web.
This picture focuses on recent genres only,
overlooking those more based on paper genres
because, in our opinion, this hot area can reveal
more about the dynamics behind genre evolution.
Preliminary findings coming out from this
study confirm the initial hypothesis and show
that users&apos; perception can be divided into three
ranges. These three ranges can be interpreted in
terms of genre evolution: high perception for the
most stable and acknowledge genres; medium
perception for emerging genres, not fully
acknowledged by the majority or still unstable,
and finally low perception for the highly
ambiguous genres (for different reasons). Some
of the new web genres can be unambiguously
perceived (for example, personal home page,
eshop, corporate home page, FAQs and search
page).
Web users can also handle a certain degree of
granularity, for example by distinguishing a
personal home page from a corporate home page,
but the boundary between academic home pages
and organizational home pages is still too fuzzy
for them.
The approach to the web as a genre repertoire
in evolution and these preliminary findings can
turn out to be useful when building web genre
palettes or when designing new genre
identification experiments.
Future work includes the computation of
agreement coefficients. K statistic is largely used

Rosso (2005: 109 ff.), but their full interpretation

More precisely, it explores the perception of genres when users are faced not only with prototypical genre exemplars but also with hybrid or individualized web pages, and interpret the subjects&apos; perception in term of genre evolution Although this exploration is partial (23 labels to be assigned to 25 web pages), it offers an interesting section of the genre repertoire on the web. This study can be also seen as a confirmatory study, because it confirms that a number of recent web genres, unprecedented in the paper world (such as home page, FAQs, and blog) can be recognized by the subjects; others have not fully emerged and many web users are not familiar with their new genre labels; finally some web pages show a high level of ambiguity and web users largely disagree on assigning labels to them.</abstract>

That is, on the web we can capture synchronically a diachronic process. From a synchronic point of view, the genre repertoire is a continuum, where there are three forces interacting: what we bring from the past (reproduced genres), what is new or adapted to the new environment (novel genres and adapted genres), what is going to emerge and is not fully formed yet (emerging genres). This view of genre evolution complements previous studies on the same subject (cf. Crowston and Williams, 1997; Shepherd and Watters, 1998; Kwasnik and Crowston, 2005). The main contribution of the synchronic 33 continuum is that an additional force has been acknowledged to take part in the evolution process, i.e. emerging genres. Emerging genres are those that are not fully standardized, that are still in formation and for which a genre label has not been created or have a label which is still opaque to the majority of users. Currently many web pages are in this phase of evolution, showing a high level of hybridism or individualization. We suggest that the subjects&apos; perception of these web pages can </context>

Previous Work No studies have been carried out so far on users&apos; perception of a genre repertoire in transition. Crowston and Williams (1997) were the first who reported on the genre repertoire on the web. They identified 48 reproduced and emergent genres in a sample of about 1,000 web pages. A few user studies were carried out with the more pragmatic approach of exploring the usefulness of genre to improve web searches and defining a genre palette appropriate for this purpose.

While the change is still ongoing, i.e. before a modified genre is redefined, or a new genre is identified with a new name, documents show mixed forms and functions (genre hybridism). This view of genre is flexible enough to encompass not only paper genres (both literary and practical genres), but also digital genres and, more specifically, web genres, such as the personal home page. The personal home page has no evident antecedent in the paper world (cf. Dillon and Gushrowski, 2000). It sprang up on the web as a new cultural object servicing the community of web users. When browsing a personal home page, web users expect a blend of standardized information (self-narration, personal interests, contact details, and often pictures related to one&apos;s life) and personal touch. Another important thing to notice is that before genre conventions become fully standardized, genres do not have an official name. A genre name becomes acknowledged when the genre itself has a role and a communicative function in a community or society (Gorlach, 2004: 9). Before this acknowledgement, a ge</context>

The web can be interpreted, among other things, as a genre repertoire in evolution because there are still many genre labels which have not been consolidated and many web pages that cannot be sorted into a recognized and acknowledged genre. The interpretation of the web as a genre repertoire in evolution has been developed within a research project on automatic identification of genre in web pages (Santini, 2006b). This interpretation is an attempt to explain the high level of hybridism and individualization of many web pages, which result in classification intractability. The study reported in this paper shows that humans have the same problems as classification algorithms when it comes to less standardized and conventionalized web pages. As it has often been pointed out (for example, cf. Kwasnik and Crowston, 2005), it is hard to pin down the concept of genre from a single perspective or to find an agreed definition of what genre is.

They were just &amp;quot;web pages&amp;quot;, with similar characteristics and functions. In 1999, suddenly a community sprang up using this new genre (Blood, 2000). Only at this point, the genre label &amp;quot;web log&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; started spreading and being recognized. Genre hybridism and individualization are evident on the web, and play an important role in the change and the creation of new genres. In fact, web pages — which can be considered as a new kind of document, much more unpredictable and customized than paper documents (Santini, 2006a) — are often hybrid because of intra-genre and inter-genre variations. They are also highly individualized because of the creative freedom provided by HTML or XML tags (the building blocks of web pages) or programming languages such as Javascript. On the web, new genres are constantly added (blogs, clogs, eshops, wikis, etc.) and traditional genres are adapted or updated in order to include more or different functionalities (online front pages, ezines, net ads, etc.). Genres such as emails, newsletters, search pages, eshops, etc. were a futuristic prophecy only 10 or 15 years ago, while toda</context>

That is, on the web we can capture synchronically a diachronic process. From a synchronic point of view, the genre repertoire is a continuum, where there are three forces interacting: what we bring from the past (reproduced genres), what is new or adapted to the new environment (novel genres and adapted genres), what is going to emerge and is not fully formed yet (emerging genres). This view of genre evolution complements previous studies on the same subject (cf. Crowston and Williams, 1997; Shepherd and Watters, 1998; Kwasnik and Crowston, 2005). The main contribution of the synchronic 33 continuum is that an additional force has been acknowledged to take part in the evolution process, i.e. emerging genres. Emerging genres are those that are not fully standardized, that are still in formation and for which a genre label has not been created or have a label which is still opaque to the majority of users. Currently many web pages are in this phase of evolution, showing a high level of hybridism or individualization. We suggest that the subjects&apos; perception of these web pages can be interpreted in term of ge</context>

As it has often been pointed out (for example, cf. Kwasnik and Crowston, 2005), it is hard to pin down the concept of genre from a single perspective or to find an agreed definition of what genre is. This lack is also experienced in the more restricted world of non-literary or nonfictional genres, such as professional or instrumental genres, where the variation due to personal style is less pronounced than in literary genres. In particular, scholars working with practical genres focus upon a specific environment. For instance Swales (1990) develops his notion of genre in academic and research settings, Bathia (1993) and Trosborg (2000) in professional settings, Yates and Orlikowsky (1992) within organizational communication. Despite the lack of an agreed theoretical notion, genre is a well-established term (cf. Karlgren, 2004), intuitively understood in its vagueness. Classifying documents by genre is a common operation that humans perform with more or less effort. Genres can be seen as &amp;quot;artifacts&amp;quot;, i.e. cultural objects created to meet and streamline communicative needs. These cultural objects represent the role that a certain</context>
