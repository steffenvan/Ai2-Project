<bodyText confidence="0.9993681">
Blogs and forums are widely adopted by on-
line communities to debate about various is-
sues. However, a user that wants to cut in on
a debate may experience some difficulties in
extracting the current accepted positions, and
can be discouraged from interacting through
these applications. In our paper, we combine
textual entailment with argumentation theory
to automatically extract the arguments from
debates and to evaluate their acceptability.

<bodyText confidence="0.999959473684211">
Online debate platforms, like Debatepedia1, Twit-
ter2 and many others, are becoming more and more
popular on the Web. In such applications, users are
asked to provide their own opinions about selected
issues. However, it may happen that the debates
become rather complicated, with several arguments
supporting and contradicting each others. Thus, it
is difficult for potential participants to understand
the way the debate is going on, i.e., which are the
current accepted arguments in a debate. In this pa-
per, we propose to support participants of online de-
bates with a framework combining Textual Entail-
ment (TE) (Dagan et al., 2009) and abstract argu-
mentation theory (Dung, 1995). In particular, TE
is adopted to extract the abstract arguments from
natural language debates and to provide the rela-
tions among these arguments; argumentation theory
is then used to compute the set of accepted argu-
ments among those obtained from the TE module,

i.e., the arguments shared by the majority of the par-
ticipants without being attacked by other accepted
arguments. The originality of the proposed frame-
work lies in the combination of two existing ap-
proaches with the goal of supporting participants in
their interactions with online debates, by automat-
ically detecting the arguments in natural language
text, and identifying the accepted ones. We evaluate
the feasibility of our combined approach on a set of
arguments extracted from a sample of Debatepedia.

TE was proposed as an applied framework to cap-
ture major semantic inference needs across applica-
tions in NLP, e.g. (Romano et al., 2006; Barzilay
and McKeown, 2005; Nielsen et al., 2009). It is de-
fined as a relation between two textual fragments,
i.e., the text (T) and the hypothesis (H). Entailment
holds if the meaning of H can be inferred from the
meaning of T, as interpreted by a typical language
user. Consider the pairs in Example 1 and 2.

A system aimed at recognizing TE should detect an
entailment relation between T1 and H (Example 1),
and a contradiction between T2 and H (Example 2).
As introduced before, our paper proposes an
approach to support the participants in forums or
debates to detect the accepted arguments among
those expressed by the other participants on a
certain topic. As a first step, we need to (i) automat-
ically recognize a participant’s opinion on a certain
topic as an argument, as well as to (ii) detect its
relationship with the other arguments. We therefore
cast the described problem as a TE problem, where
the T-H pair is a pair of arguments expressed by
two different participants on a certain topic. For in-
stance, given the argument “The use of cell-phones
while driving is a public hazard” (that we consider
as H as a starting point), participants can support it
expressing arguments from which H can be inferred
(Example 1), or can contradict such argument with
opinions against it (Example 2). Since in debates
arguments come one after the other, we extract
and compare them both with respect to the main
issue, and with the other participants’ arguments
(when the new argument entails or contradicts one
of the arguments previously expressed by another
participant). For instance, given the same debate as
before, a new argument T3 may be expressed by a
third participant with the goal of contradicting T2
(that becomes the new H (H1) in the pair), as shown
in Example 3.

while in their car over a cell phone and apologizing in
front of their boss at the office. So, they should have the
restraint to drive at the speed limit, arriving late, and
being willing to apologize then; an apologetic cell phone
call in a car to a boss shouldn’t be the cause of one being
able to then relax, slow-down, and drive the speed-limit.

TE provides us with the techniques to detect both
the arguments in a debate, and the kind of relation
underlying each couple of arguments. The TE sys-
tem returns indeed a judgment (entailment or con-
tradiction) on the arguments’ pairs, that are used as
input to build the argumentation framework, as de-
scribed in the next Section.

3 Second step: argumentation theory
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999689083333333">
Starting from a set of arguments and the attacks (i.e.,
conflicts) among them, a (Dung, 1995)-style argu-
mentation framework allows to detect which are the
accepted arguments. Such arguments are consid-
ered as believable by an external evaluator who has
a full knowledge of the argumentation framework,
and they are determined through the acceptability
semantics (Dung, 1995). Roughly, an argument is
accepted, if all the arguments attacking it are re-
jected, and it is rejected if it has at least an argument
attacking it which is accepted. An argument which
is not attacked at all is accepted.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.998316">
Definition 1. An abstract argumentation framework (AF)
is a pair (A, —*) where A is a set of arguments and —*C
A x A is a binary relation called attack.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901566666667">
Aim of the argumentation-based reasoning step is
to provide the participant with a complete view on
the arguments proposed in the debate, and to show
which are the accepted ones. In our framework, we
first map contradiction with the attack relation in ab-
stract argumentation; second, the entailment relation
is viewed as a support relation among abstract argu-
ments. The support relation (Cayrol and Lagasquie-
Schiex, 2011) may be represented as: (1) a relation
among the arguments which does not affect their ac-
ceptability, or (2) a relation among the arguments
which leads to the introduction of additional attacks.
Consider a support relation among two argu-
ments, namely Ai and Aj. If we choose (1), an at-
tack towards Ai or Aj does not affect the acceptabil-
ity of Aj or Ai, respectively. If we choose (2), we
introduce additional attacks, and we have the follow-
ing two options: [Type 1] Ai supports Aj then Ak
attacks Aj, and [Type 2] Ai supports Aj then Ak at-
tacks Ai. The attacks of type 1 are due to inference:
Ai entails Aj means that Ai is more specific of Aj,
thus an attack towards Aj is an attack also towards
Ai. The attacks of type 2, instead, are more rare,
but they may happen in debates: an attack towards
the more specific argument Ai is an attack towards
the more general argument Aj. In Section 4, we will
consider only the introduction of attacks of type 1.
For Examples 1, 2, and 3, the TE phase returns
the following couples: T1 entails H, T2 attacks H,
T3 attacks H1 (i.e. T2). The argumentation module
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.998450666666667">
maps each element to its corresponding argument: H
= A1, T1 = A2, T2 = A3, and T3 = A4 . The resulting
AF (Figure 1) shows that the accepted arguments
are {A1, A2, A41, meaning that the issue “The use of
cell-phones while driving is a public hazard” (A1) is
considered as accepted. Figure 2 visualizes the com-
plete framework of the debate “Use of cell phones
while driving” on Debatepedia. Accepted arguments
are double bordered.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999592">
We experiment the combination of TE and argumen-
tation theory to support the interaction of online de-
bates participants on Debatepedia, an encyclopedia
of pro and con arguments on critical issues.
Data set. To create the data set of arguments pairs
to evaluate our task3, we randomly selected a set of
topics (reported in column Topics, Table 1) of De-
batepedia debates, and for each topic we coupled all
the pros and cons arguments both with the main ar-
gument (the issue of the debate, as in Example 1

and 2) and/or with other arguments to which the
most recent argument refers, e.g., Example 3. Using
Debatepedia as case study provides us with already
annotated arguments (pro ==&gt;. entailment4, and cons
==&gt;. contradiction), and casts our task as a yes/no en-
tailment task. As shown in Table 1, we collected 200
T-H pairs, 100 used to train the TE system, and 100
to test it (each data set is composed by 55 entailment
and 45 contradiction pairs).5 Test set pairs concern
completely new topics, never seen by the system.
TE system. To detect which kind of relation un-
derlies each couple of arguments, we used the
EDITS system (Edit Distance Textual Entailment
Suite), an open-source software package for recog-
nizing TE6 (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010). EDITS
implements a distance-based framework which as-
sumes that the probability of an entailment relation
between a given T-H pair is inversely proportional
to the distance between T and H. Within this frame-
work, the system implements different approaches
to distance computation, providing both edit dis-
tance algorithms and similarity algorithms.
Evaluation. To evaluate our combined approach,
we carry out a two-step evaluation: we assess (i) the
performances of the TE system to correctly assign
the entailment/contradiction relations to the pairs
of arguments in the Debatepedia data set; (ii) how
much such performances impact on the goals of the
argumentation module, i.e. how much a wrong as-
signment of a relation between two arguments leads
to an incorrect evaluation of the accepted arguments.
For the first evaluation, we run the EDITS sys-
tem off-the-shelf on the Debatepedia data set, ap-
plying one of its basic configurations (i.e. the dis-
tance entailment engine combines cosine similarity
as the core distance algorithm; distance calculated
on lemmas; stopword list included). EDITS accu-
racy on the training set is 0.69, on the test set 0.67
(a baseline applying a Word Overlap algorithm on
tokenized text is also considered, and obtains an ac-
curacy of 0.61 on the training set and 0.62 on the test
set). Even using a basic configuration of EDITS, and
a small data set (100 pairs for training) performances

with performances of TE systems on RTE data sets.
As a second step of the evaluation, we consider
the impact of EDITS performances on arguments ac-
ceptability, i.e., how much a wrong assignment of a
relation to a pair of arguments affects the computa-
tion of the set of accepted arguments. We identify
the accepted arguments both in the correct AF of
each Debatepedia debate of the data set (the gold-
standard, where relations are correctly assigned),
and on the AF generated basing on the relations
assigned by EDITS. Our combined approach ob-
tained the following performances: precision 0.74,
recall 0.76, accuracy 0.75, meaning that the TE sys-
tem mistakes in relation assignment propagate in the
AF, but results are still satisfying and foster further
research in this direction.

Several research lines are considered to improve the
proposed framework: first, the use of NLP to de-
tect the arguments from text will make argumenta-
tion theory applicable to reason in real scenarios. We
plan to use the TE module to reason on the introduc-
tion of the support relation in abstract argumentation
theory. We plan to extend our model by consider-
ing also other kinds of relationships among the ar-
guments. Moreover, given the promising results we
obtained, we plan to extend the experimentation set-
ting both increasing the size of the Debatepedia data
set, and to improve the TE system performances to
apply our combined approach in other real applica-
tions (considering for instance the presence of un-
related arguments, e.g. texts that do not entail nor
contradict).

Thus, it is difficult for potential participants to understand the way the debate is going on, i.e., which are the current accepted arguments in a debate. In this paper, we propose to support participants of online debates with a framework combining Textual Entailment (TE) (Dagan et al., 2009) and abstract argumentation theory (Dung, 1995). In particular, TE is adopted to extract the abstract arguments from natural language debates and to provide the relations among these arguments; argumentation theory is then used to compute the set of accepted arguments among those obtained from the TE module, 1http://debatepedia.idebate.org 2http://twitter.com/ i.e., the arguments shared by the majority of the participants without being attacked by other accepted arguments.

T2 —* H1: Regulation could negate the safety benefits of having a phone in the car. When you’re stuck in [...] TE provides us with the techniques to detect both the arguments in a debate, and the kind of relation underlying each couple of arguments. The TE system returns indeed a judgment (entailment or contradiction) on the arguments’ pairs, that are used as input to build the argumentation framework, as described in the next Section. 3 Second step: argumentation theory Starting from a set of arguments and the attacks (i.e., conflicts) among them, a (Dung, 1995)-style argumentation framework allows to detect which are the accepted arguments. Such arguments are considered as believable by an external evaluator who has a full knowledge of the argumentation framework, and they are determined through the acceptability semantics (Dung, 1995). Roughly, an argument is accepted, if all the arguments attacking it are rejected, and it is rejected if it has at least an argument attacking it which is accepted. An argument which is not attacked at all is accepted. Definition 1. An abstract argumentation framework (AF) is a pair (A, —*) where A is a set of argumen</context>

As shown in Table 1, we collected 200 T-H pairs, 100 used to train the TE system, and 100 to test it (each data set is composed by 55 entailment and 45 contradiction pairs).5 Test set pairs concern completely new topics, never seen by the system. TE system. To detect which kind of relation underlies each couple of arguments, we used the EDITS system (Edit Distance Textual Entailment Suite), an open-source software package for recognizing TE6 (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010). EDITS implements a distance-based framework which assumes that the probability of an entailment relation between a given T-H pair is inversely proportional to the distance between T and H. Within this framework, the system implements different approaches to distance computation, providing both edit distance algorithms and similarity algorithms. Evaluation. To evaluate our combined approach, we carry out a two-step evaluation: we assess (i) the performances of the TE system to correctly assign the entailment/contradiction relations to the pairs of arguments in the Debatepedia data set; (ii) h</context>

The originality of the proposed framework lies in the combination of two existing approaches with the goal of supporting participants in their interactions with online debates, by automatically detecting the arguments in natural language text, and identifying the accepted ones. We evaluate the feasibility of our combined approach on a set of arguments extracted from a sample of Debatepedia. 2 First step: textual entailment TE was proposed as an applied framework to capture major semantic inference needs across applications in NLP, e.g. (Romano et al., 2006; Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Nielsen et al., 2009). It is defined as a relation between two textual fragments, i.e., the text (T) and the hypothesis (H). Entailment holds if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T, as interpreted by a typical language user. Consider the pairs in Example 1 and 2. Example 1. T1: Research shows that drivers speaking on a mobile phone have much slower reactions in braking tests than non-users, and are worse even than if they have been drinking. H:The use of cell-phones while driving is a public hazard. Example 2 (Continued). T2: Regulation could negate the safety benefits of having a phone in the c</context>
