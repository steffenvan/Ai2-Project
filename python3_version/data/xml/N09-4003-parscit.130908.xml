Dynamic Programming (DP) is an important class of algorithms widely used in many ar-
eas of speech and language processing. It provides efficient solutions to seemingly intractable
inference over exponentially-large spaces by sharing overlapping subproblems. Well-known
examples of DP in our field include Viterbi and Forward-Backward Algorithms for finite-
state models, CKY and Earley Algorithms for context-free parsing, and A* Algorithm for
both. These algorithms are widely used to solve problems ranging from sequence labeling
to word alignment to machine translation decoding.
With this overwhelming popularity, this tutorial aims to provide a better understanding

of DP from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In the theory part, we try to unify
various DP algorithms under a generic algebraic framework, where the above mentioned
examples are merely special cases, and we can easily analyze their correctness and complex-
ities. However, exact DP algorithms are often infeasible in practice due to time and space
constraints. So in the practice part, we will survey several widely used tricks to reduce the
size of the search space, including beam search, histogram pruning, coarse-to-fine search,
and cube pruning. We will discuss these methods within the context of state-of-the-art
large-scale NLP systems.

Liang Huang is a Research Scientist at Google Research (Mountain View). He recently
obtained his PhD in 2008 from the University of Pennsylvania under Aravind Joshi and
Kevin Knight (USC/ISI). His research interests include algorithms in parsing and transla-
tion, generic dynamic programming, and syntax-based machine translation. His work on
“forest-based algorithms” received an Outstanding Paper Award at ACL 2008, as well as
Best Paper Nominations at ACL 2007 and EMNLP 2008. He also loves teaching and was a
recipient of the University Teaching Prize at Penn.
