In this paper, we put forward some ideas on
the representation of time in a machine
translation system. In such a system, we
usually have the following four representations:
- source text
- source representation
- target representation
- target text
In an interlingual system, there is no
difference between source and target
representation; in a transfer-based system,
the step between the two is usually called
transfer, and this step is meant to be as
simple as possible.
The research described was originally done in
the framework of the EUROTRA MT project,
which is transfer-based. However, it can
be used in other MT systems as well; in
fact, it is very well suited for interlingual
systems.
The problem with time meaning is that it is
expressed in natural languages in a way that
is non-universal and, moreover, not very
perspicuous prima facie. As a consequence, it
is difficult to find rules for the
translation of the tense form of the verb.
In this paper, we propose a conceptual
calculus in which the meanings of
language specific temporal expressions
can be represented in an interlingual way,
so that the translation of the latter can
be achieved via the corresponding conceptual
representations.
The exposition will consist of three parts.
First, we define a time axis model, i.e. a
model in which temporal concepts can be
understood.
Second, we establish two types of general
constraints:
(0 Constraints on possible time meaning
representations, resulting in a restricted
class of meaninos for time and related
phenomena in terms of this model.
(ii) Constraints on the relations between
syntactic/morphological forms and time
meanings, resulting in a non-arbitrary •
relation between form and meaning.
Third, we show how the calculus can be
used for the interlingual analysis of
the tense forms of verbs.
1. The time axis model.
The model is a temporal structure
(time,&lt; &gt;, where
time is a set of elements called time-points:
&lt; is a binary relation that linearly orders
time (and can be interpreted as &apos;precedes&amp;quot;):
An interval (I) is a subset of time that does
not contain &apos;gaps&apos;, i.e.: V tl,t2 e I
V t3 e time (t1&lt;t3(t2 t3 e I ).
We now turn to the time meanings and their
representations.
First, we want to separate the expression
that represents time meaning from the rest of
the sentence. The instruments we use are
based on Dowty (1979):
A two-place operator AT that takes an
interval and a formula to yield another
formula, with the following interpretation:
CAT(I,0)=1 at whatever time t iff W(0)=I at
the interval I.
Temporal predicates that take an interval to
yield a formula, e.g.,
W(yesterday(I))=1 iff the interval I is a
subset of yesterday.

(iii) The 5-interval consists of one point only:
Temporal relations that take two intervals it is a singleton. The R- and E-intervals are
to yield a formula, e.g., non-empty subsets of time.
W(before(I,J))=1 iff
V t,t E time (t E I lc t&apos; E J ---&gt; t&lt;t&apos;)

where the I, are intervals, the Rel., are
binary relations between intervals like
&apos;before , the Predk are predicates like
&apos;yesterday&apos;, and p is a basic proposition,
from which all time-relevant parts have
been removed.
The category of expression (1) is t/t; it can
be applied to a basic proposition in a
functional way.
The interpretation of (1) is the set of
propositions that are true at some given
interval I.. This is similar to Kripke&apos;s
definition of the notion of &apos;possible world&apos;:
&apos;A possible world is given by the descriptive
conditions we associate with it....&apos; (1972,
p. 44). Analogously, a time interval
can be identified with the collection of
propositions that are true at it.
2. A theory of time meanings.
In many discussions of time meaning, a
distinction is made between an internal and
an external temporal system. The external
system represents the temporal relation
between the state of affairs as described by
the basic proposition and the time at which
the utterance takes place. This system always
refers to the speaker or writer, and
consequently it is a deictic system. The
internal system is about such things as
whether the state of affairs expressed in the
basic proposition is described as going on,
having just started, having been completed,
etc. This type of information is often called
aspectual.
In this paper, we adopt the following three
basic principles for the representation of
time meanings:
(I)
Each time meaning representation contains
exactly three time intervals:
- the time of speech or narration (S)
- the time of event (E), i.e. the interval
at which the basic proposition is said
to be true
- one time of reference (R)
(II)
The deictic part of time meaning is represented
by a binary relation between S and R and
optionally by one predicate over R.
(III)
Aspect is represented by a binary relation
between R and E, and optionally by one
predicate over E.
Principles (I), (II), and (III) together
imply that the general form of a time meaning
representation can be somewhat simplified. It
will now be:
(2)
A p 3 S,R,E c time (Reli(R,S) &amp; PredI(R) &amp;
Re12(E,R) &amp; Pred2(E) &amp; AT(E,p))
Apart from the constraints on possible
time meaning representations there are some
constraints on the relation between the
time meanings and the language specific
morphosyntactic forms for expressing those
meanings:
(IV)
The predicates over R are those time
adverbials that can be used as answers to
when-questions, such as
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.3510635">
(3) yesterday, now, next week, on Tuesday
(V)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9620109">
The predicates over E are (a.o.) the
duration time adverbials, such as
(4) for an hour, five weeks, since
Christmas, until June
(VI)
The relations between R and 5 and between
E and R are determined by the interaction
of the verbal tense forms and the time
adverbials in ways to be specified and
exemplified in section three.
We will now present the deictic and the
aspectual components of the temporal system
in some detail.
2.1. The deictic system.
As possible relations between S and R we
will take
(0 before (R,S), defined as in I.
(ii) after (R,S), defined analogously
(iii) contain (R.S), defined as follows :
V t e time (t a 5 ---&gt; t E R)
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989839">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.982721081081081">
The specifiers of the reference time are the
when-adverbials. A classification of the
latter that appears to be relevant for the
assignment of deictic values in particular
cases is the following one :
in fact, an iterative interpretation, and for
such interpretations we need a more complex
representation format. This will not be
developed in this paper, but see Van Eynde
(forthcoming).
deictic absolute
before after contain on Tuesday
yesterday next now
week
The deictic when-adverbials define the position
of the reference time with respect to the time
of speech, and cannot be combined with all
possible tenses. An after-adverbial is, for
instance, not compatible with the simple past:
(5) * he came next week
The absolute when-adverbials determine the
position of the reference time independently
from the speech time. Depending on which tense
they are combined with they can either specify
a reference time that precedes the speech time,
as in
(6) she came on Tuesday
or a reference time. that follows the speech
time, as in
(7) she comes/is coming/will come on Tuesday
Since there is only one reference time in the
representation (= principle (I)) and since
the when-adverbials always specify the reference
time (= principle (IV)), it is predicted that a
proposition can contain at most one when-adverbial.
At first sight this prediction seems to hold:
cf. the ungrammaticality of
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.817951">
(8) a. * He left yesterday one week ago
b. * In 1990 he will have arrived in 1998
c. * In 1955 he had died in 1944
There are, however, some problem cases, such as
(9) He left on Tuesday at 9 o&apos;clock
(10) Last year he used to arrive at 9 o&apos;clock
(9) contains two when-adverbials, but notice
that they can be used together as an answer to
one when-question, and this indicates that
&apos;on Tuesday at 9 o&apos;clock&apos; is just a complex
specification of one and the same interval.
(10) is a more serious case. Here the two
adverbials cannot be considered to specify the
same interval: &apos;last year&apos; denotes the time
of his habit to arrive at 9 o&apos;clock and
&apos;at 9 o&apos;clock&apos; denotes the time of each of his
arrivals of last year. What we have in (10) is,

<bodyText confidence="0.983711644444445">
2.2. The aspectual part.
There is much discussion in the literature
about what aspect is. A description that is
not very precise, but has the merit of being
independent of linguistic form, is the one
given by Comrie (1976, p. 3):
&apos;As the general definition of aspect, we may
take the formulation that &amp;quot;aspects are
different ways of viewing the internal
temporal constituency of a situation&amp;quot;..
In an article on the general theory of
aspect Friedrich distinguishes three
possible aspects :
(i) punctual, completive, perfective, etc;
(ii) durative, continuative, etc;
(iii) stative, perfect, etc.
(cf. Friedrich 1974, p. 36)
The same three aspects turn up in the work
of Comrie, Johnson, Hopper, and others.
We will call them respectively perfective,
imperfective, and retrospective.
The intuitions about the three are basically
the following:
(i) perfective
This aspect presents a situation &apos;as a
single unanalyzable whole&apos; (Comrie, o.c.,
p. 3).
(ii) imperfective:
This aspect &apos;looks at the situation from the
inside&apos; (Comrie, op. cit, p.4), and focusses
on beginning, continuation, or ending of it.
(iii) retrospective:
This aspect &apos;expresses a relation between two
time-points, on the one hand the time of the
state resulting from a prior situation, and
on the other the time of that prior
situation.&apos; (ibid., p. 52).
In order to make these notions more precise,
and -at the same time- to integrate them into
our representation format, we will adopt the
following proposal by Johnson:
&apos;What I am proposing concerning the semantics
of the aspect forms is that they specify the
relation between reference time and event time
in an utterance.&apos; (Johnson 1981, p. 153)
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997182">
37
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.971841509615385">
As applied to the different aspects this
gives the following results :
(i) perfective:
In th.s case we take the relation between E and
R to be one of containment (during (E,R)),where
the latter is defined as follows:
during (x,y) iff U t E time (t E X ---&gt; t e y)
The fact that E is contained in R is meant to
be the formal counterpart of the intuition that
E is seen as a single unanalyzable whole from
the point of view defined by R.
(ii) imperfective:
This is subdivided into three classes:
(ii.i) durative: contain (E,R), defined as in 2.1.
(focus on the continuation)
(ii.ii) inchoative: since (E,R), definition:
since(x,y) iff x n y 0
&amp; 3 t&apos; E time V t e time (t e x &amp; t&apos; ---&gt; t&apos;(t)
&amp; 3 t e time 01 t&apos; e time (t e x &amp; t&apos; e y t&gt;t&apos;)
(focus on the beginning of E)
(ii.iii) terminative: Until (E,R), definition:
until(x,y) iff x n y 0
&amp; 3 t e time 11 t&apos; e time (t e x &amp; t&apos; E y ---) t&lt;t&apos;)
&amp; 3 t&apos; E time V t e time (t e x &amp; t&apos; e y t.)t)
(focus on the ending of E)
(iii) retrospective:
The relation is simply before (E,R).
Some authors also distinguish a socalled
&apos;prospective aspect (cf. Comrie 1976). It
seems to be less common than the other ones,
and there is some disagreement on the issue
of what its language specific counterparts
are (&apos;to be going to&apos; ?), but conceptually
it can be defined fairly easily, namely as
the complement of the retrospective aspect:
(iv) prospective: after (E,R)
The interval E can be specified by
adverbials. One class of E-specifiers is the
class of duration adverbials. The reasons
for treating these adverbials as
E-specifiers are the following ones :
1. they always denote the interval at which
the basic proposition is said to take place;
in that respect they are different from the
when-adverbials, since the latter can also
denote a time that does not coincide with the
event time (cf. the non-perfective aspects).
2. they cannot be combined with all possible
propositions; they are, for instance, not
compatible with momentaneous events:
(11) they reached the summit for a while
The ungrammaticality of (11) can be explained
if we take the duration adverbials to specify
the event time, since the latter cannot be
both a moment (as required by the proposition)
and an interval of some duration (as required
by the adverbial).
3. they never have a deictic function: they
are not used for specifying the relation
between some interval and the.moment of speech.
As in the case of the when-adverbials it is
possible to have two duration adverbials in the
same clause:
(12) he has been studying two hours a day
since his childhood now
Notice, however, that (12) has an iterative
interpretation, and since the treatment of
such interpretations requires a more
elaborated representation scheme anyway,
we can stick to the principle that a clause
contains at most one E-specifier. In this case
the E-specifier is &apos;since his childhood&apos;:
&apos;two hours&apos; is another type of specifier (cf.
Van Eynde, forthcoming).
2.3. The calculus as a whole.
In the preceding sections it has been stipulated
that there are three possible relations between
S and R, and six possible relations between R
and E. At first sight that seems to be rather
arbitrary, but a careful analysis of the concepts
involved shows that they, in fact, exhaust the
range of logical possibilities :
For any two intervals x and y S time,
either x n y = 0
and then either before(x,y)
or after(x,y)
These are the six aspectual values. The reason
why the deictic system has only three possible
values is that the speech time - unlike the
reference and the event time - is always a
singleton, and if one of the intervals involved
is a singleton, then the relations &apos;since&apos; and
&apos;until&apos; and either &apos;during&apos; or &apos;contain&apos; cannot
hold by definition. It appears, thus, that both
the deictic and the aspectual distinctions are
not only mutually exclusive but also exhaustive
within their respective domains.
Together they form the core of the temporal
calculus. This core has to be extended in
various ways if one wants to take into
account the phenomenon of iterativity, the
sequence of tenses in complex sentences, and
the relevance of the event type of the basic
proposition (cf. Vendler&apos;s distinction of

or x n y 0
and then either x 6 y, i.e. during(x,y)
or ft(x S y)
and then either x 2 y,
i.e. contain(x,y;

and then either since(x,,,fl
or until

states, activities, accomplishments,
achievements). Part of this has already been
incorporated in the formalism, but in stead
of presenting those extensions we think it
more useful to round off this paper with a
demonstration of how the calculus can be used
for the interlingual analysis of verbal
tense forms.
3. The interlinoual analysis of tenses.
For the interlingual analysis of the verbal
tense forms we adopt the following principle:
(VII)
The interlingual representations of verbal
tense forms are pairs consisting of one
deictic and one aspectual value.
As the number of possible combinations of
deictic and aspectual values is 18 (3x6), it
follows that each tense form can have at
most 18 different interlingual representations.
In order to determine which values a given
tense can actually have one has to examine
its compatibility with the different types of
time adverbials.
As for the deictic subpart, it is not so
difficult to invent a criterion:
(i)
If tense X is compatible with a deictic
Y-adverbial, where Y E (after, before,
contain), then the tense X can have the
value Y.
For the aspectual subpart the criteria are
a bit more complicated:
tii)
If tense X can be used in a sentence with a
when-adverbial in which the event is said to
take place before or after the interval
denoted by that when-adverbial. then the
aspectual value of X can be either &apos;before&apos;
or &apos;after&apos;, i.e. X can be used to express
either retrospectivity or prospectivity.
(iii)
If tense X can be used in a sentence which
contains both a when-adverbial and a duration
adverbial that denotes an interval that is
larger than the interval denoted by the
when-adverbial, then tense X can be used to
express the durative aspect.
Similar criteria have to be stated for the
other aspects (inchoative, terminative, and
perfective). As far as we can see now the
perfective aspect might well be considered
to be the default value: from a conceptual
point of view the least marked situation
is the one in which the event time is contained
in or identical with the reference time
(E c R or E = R).
As an illustration of how these criteria can
be used in practice we give an interlingual
analysis of the Dutch &apos;Voltooid Tegenwoordige
Tijd (VTT)&apos;. This tense is expressed by the
combination of an auxiliary (shebben. or
&apos;zijn&apos;) and the perfect participle of a
lexical verb.
The VTT can be combined with all kinds of
when-adverbial 5:
(13) nu heb ik het gevonden
now-have-I-it-found
(14) morgen heb ik het gevonden
tomorrow-have-I-it-found
(15) gisteren heb ik het gevonden
yesterday-have-I-it-found
In (13) and (14) the time of event precedes
the time denoted by resp. &amp;quot;nu&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;morgen&amp;quot;;
hence, the aspectual value of the VTT in
these sentences is the retrospective one.
In fact, (13) and (14) belong to a paradigm
of retrospective tenses. The other members
of the paradigm are the &amp;quot;Voltooid Verleden
Tijd&amp;quot; and the °Voltooid Toekomende Tijd&amp;quot;,
as in
(16) gisteren had ik het al gevonden
yesterday-had-I-it-already-found
(17) morgen zal ik het gevonden hebben
tomorrow-shall-I-it-found-have
(14) and (17) even have the same meaning and,
hence, the same interlingual representation,
namely the combination after - before.
(13) has the value contain - before, and
(16) the value before - before.
In (15) the situation is different: here, the
time of finding does not precede the interval
denoted by &amp;quot;yesterday&amp;quot; (as in (16)), but is
rather contained in it. The aspectual value of
the VTT in (16) is hence the perfective one,
and the interlingual representation in that case
is before - during.
It can further be shown that the VTT cannot be
used to express a durative aspect. Compare
(18) gisteren ben ik de hele dag ziek geweest
yesterday-am-I-the-whole-day-ill-been
(19) * gisteren ben ik drie dagen ziek geweest
yesterday-am-I-three-days-ill-been
In (18) the event time denoted by the duration
adverbial &amp;quot;de hele dag&amp;quot; is a subset of the
interval denoted by &amp;quot;gisteren&amp;quot; (= perfective
aspect); in (19), on the other hand, the
event time (three days) is said to be longer
than the reference time (one day). Since this
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997898">
39
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.98735838">
combination leads to ungrammaticality (in
Dutch), it follows that the VTT cannot express
durativity.
If these analyses are correct, it follows that
the Dutch VII can have three distinct inter-
lingual representations: contain - before,
after - before, and before - during.
The general idea now is that this information
is contained in the lexicon, and that for the
assignment of temporal representations to
particular sentences one first looks in the
lexicon to see which interlingual representations
the tense used in that particular sentence can
have, and then singles out that subset of
representations which is compatible with the
time adverbials used in the sentence.
If that subset contains exactly one member the
sentence may be said to be unambiguous with
respect to the temporal calculus; if the subset
contains more members, the sentence is said to
be temporally ambiguous; and if the subset is
empty, the sentence is simply not well-formed.
As a conclusion to this section we give the
representations of some of the discussed
sentences
(13) 3 S,R,E S time (contain(R,S) &amp; nu(R) &amp;
before(E,R) &amp; AT (E, ik het vinden))
(15) 3 S,R,E S time (before(R,S) &amp; gisteren(R) &amp;
during(E,R) &amp; AT(E, ik het vinden))
(18) 3 S,R,E S time (before(R,S) &amp; gisteren(R) &amp;
during(E,R) &amp; de hele dag(E)
&amp; AT(E, ik ziek zijn))
4. Prospects.
In this paper we have concentrated on the
definition of a conceptual calculus for the
representation of time meanings in natural
language. We have also given principles
(IV,V,V1,VII) and criteria (i,ii,iii) for
relating the concepts of the calculus to
language specific morphosyntactic categories.
Given these tools, it should be possible to
analyse the tenses of the different languages
in such a way that the results of the analysis
are comparable and, indeed, identical iff they
express the same concept.
It goes without saying that the actual analysis
of all possible tenses cannot be carried out
in a paper of this size, but we have the
feeling that we have at least cleared the
ground for such an enterprise.

<abstract confidence="0.998711565765767">In this paper, we put forward some ideas on the representation of time in a machine translation system. In such a system, we usually have the following four representations: source text source representation target representation target text In an interlingual system, there is no difference between source and target representation; in a transfer-based system, the step between the two is usually called transfer, and this step is meant to be as simple as possible. The research described was originally done in the framework of the EUROTRA MT project, which is transfer-based. However, it can be used in other MT systems as well; in fact, it is very well suited for interlingual systems. The problem with time meaning is that it is expressed in natural languages in a way that is non-universal and, moreover, not very perspicuous prima facie. As a consequence, it to find rules for the translation of the tense form of the verb. In this paper, we propose a conceptual calculus in which the meanings of language specific temporal expressions can be represented in an interlingual way, so that the translation of the latter can be achieved via the corresponding conceptual representations. The exposition will consist of three parts. First, we define a time axis model, i.e. a temporal concepts can be understood. Second, we establish two types of general constraints: on possible time meaning representations, resulting in a restricted class of meaninos for time and related phenomena in terms of this model. (ii) Constraints on the relations between syntactic/morphological forms and time meanings, resulting in a non-arbitrary • relation between form and meaning. Third, we show how the calculus can be used for the interlingual analysis of the tense forms of verbs. 1. The time axis model. The model is a temporal structure (time,&lt; &gt;, where is a set of elements called &lt; is a binary relation that linearly orders time (and can be interpreted as &apos;precedes&amp;quot;): interval(I) is a subset of time that does not contain &apos;gaps&apos;, i.e.: V tl,t2 e I t3 (t1&lt;t3(t2 t3 e I ). We now turn to the time meanings and their representations. First, we want to separate the expression that represents time meaning from the rest of the sentence. The instruments we use are based on Dowty (1979): A two-place operator AT that takes an interval and a formula to yield another formula, with the following interpretation: at whatever time t iff the interval I. Temporal predicates that take an interval to yield a formula, e.g., W(yesterday(I))=1 iff the interval I is a subset of yesterday. 35 (iii) The 5-interval consists of one point only: Temporal relations that take two intervals it is a singleton. The Rand E-intervals are to yield a formula, e.g., non-empty subsets of time. W(before(I,J))=1 iff t,t (t I lc t&apos; E ---&gt; t&lt;t&apos;) (iv) A-abstraction to separate the temporal expression from the basic proposition, so that the representation of the temporal expresssion takes the following forms (1) p 3 time &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; AT p) ) where the I, are intervals, the Rel., are binary relations between intervals like &apos;before , the Predk are predicates like &apos;yesterday&apos;, and p is a basic proposition, from which all time-relevant parts have been removed. The category of expression (1) is t/t; it can be applied to a basic proposition in a functional way. The interpretation of (1) is the set of propositions that are true at some given interval I.. This is similar to Kripke&apos;s definition of the notion of &apos;possible world&apos;: &apos;A possible world is given by the descriptive conditions we associate with it....&apos; (1972, p. 44). Analogously, a time interval can be identified with the collection of propositions that are true at it. 2. A theory of time meanings. In many discussions of time meaning, a is made between an internaland externaltemporal system. The external system represents the temporal relation between the state of affairs as described by the basic proposition and the time at which the utterance takes place. This system always refers to the speaker or writer, and it is a deicticsystem. The internal system is about such things as whether the state of affairs expressed in the basic proposition is described as going on, having just started, having been completed, etc. This type of information is often called aspectual. In this paper, we adopt the following three basic principles for the representation of time meanings: (I) Each time meaning representation contains exactly three time intervals: the time of speech or narration (S) the time of event (E), i.e. the interval at which the basic proposition is said to be true one time of reference (II) The deictic part of time meaning is represented by a binary relation between S and R and optionally by one predicate over R. (III) Aspect is represented by a binary relation between R and E, and optionally by one predicate over E. Principles (I), (II), and (III) together imply that the general form of a time meaning representation can be somewhat simplified. It will now be: (2) p 3 S,R,E c time (Reli(R,S) &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; AT(E,p)) Apart from the constraints on possible time meaning representations there are some constraints on the relation between the time meanings and the language specific morphosyntactic forms for expressing those meanings: (IV) The predicates over R are those time that can as answers to when-questions, such as (3) yesterday, now, next week, on Tuesday (V) The predicates over E are (a.o.) the duration time adverbials, such as (4) for an hour, five weeks, since Christmas, until June (VI) The relations between R and 5 and between E and R are determined by the interaction of the verbal tense forms and the time adverbials in ways to be specified and exemplified in section three. We will now present the deictic and the aspectual components of the temporal system in some detail. 2.1. The deictic system. As possible relations between S and R we will take (0 before (R,S), defined as in I. (ii) after (R,S), defined analogously (iii) contain (R.S), defined as follows : t (t a 5 ---&gt; E R) 36 The specifiers of the reference time are the when-adverbials. A classification of the latter that appears to be relevant for the assignment of deictic values in particular cases is the following one : in fact, an iterative interpretation, and for such interpretations we need a more complex representation format. This will not be developed in this paper, but see Van Eynde (forthcoming). deictic absolute before after contain on Tuesday yesterday next now week The deictic when-adverbials define the position of the reference time with respect to the time of speech, and cannot be combined with all possible tenses. An after-adverbial is, for instance, not compatible with the simple past: (5) * he came next week The absolute when-adverbials determine the position of the reference time independently from the speech time. Depending on which tense they are combined with they can either specify a reference time that precedes the speech time, as in (6) she came on Tuesday a reference that follows the speech time, as in (7) she comes/is coming/will come on Tuesday Since there is only one reference time in the representation (= principle (I)) and since the when-adverbials always specify the reference time (= principle (IV)), it is predicted that a proposition can contain at most one when-adverbial. At first sight this prediction seems to hold: cf. the ungrammaticality of (8) a. * He left yesterday one week ago * 1990 he will have arrived in 1998 c. * In 1955 he had died in 1944 There are, however, some problem cases, such as (9) He left on Tuesday at 9 o&apos;clock (10) Last year he used to arrive at 9 o&apos;clock (9) contains two when-adverbials, but notice that they can be used together as an answer to one when-question, and this indicates that &apos;on Tuesday at 9 o&apos;clock&apos; is just a complex specification of one and the same interval. (10) is a more serious case. Here the two adverbials cannot be considered to specify the same interval: &apos;last year&apos; denotes the time of his habit to arrive at 9 o&apos;clock and &apos;at 9 o&apos;clock&apos; denotes the time of each of his arrivals of last year. What we have in (10) is, 2.2. The aspectual part. There is much discussion in the literature about what aspect is. A description that is not very precise, but has the merit of being independent of linguistic form, is the one given by Comrie (1976, p. 3): &apos;As the general definition of aspect, we may take the formulation that &amp;quot;aspects are different ways of viewing the internal temporal constituency of a situation&amp;quot;.. In an article on the general theory of aspect Friedrich distinguishes three possible aspects : (i) punctual, completive, perfective, etc; (ii) durative, continuative, etc; (iii) stative, perfect, etc. (cf. Friedrich 1974, p. 36) The same three aspects turn up in the work of Comrie, Johnson, Hopper, and others. We will call them respectively perfective, imperfective, and retrospective. The intuitions about the three are basically the following: (i) perfective This aspect presents a situation &apos;as a single unanalyzable whole&apos; (Comrie, o.c., p. 3). (ii) imperfective: This aspect &apos;looks at the situation from the inside&apos; (Comrie, op. cit, p.4), and focusses on beginning, continuation, or ending of it. (iii) retrospective: This aspect &apos;expresses a relation between two time-points, on the one hand the time of the state resulting from a prior situation, and on the other the time of that prior situation.&apos; (ibid., p. 52). In order to make these notions more precise, and -at the same timeto integrate them into our representation format, we will adopt the following proposal by Johnson: &apos;What I am proposing concerning the semantics of the aspect forms is that they specify the relation between reference time and event time in an utterance.&apos; (Johnson 1981, p. 153) 37 As applied to the different aspects this gives the following results : (i) perfective: In th.s case we take the relation between E and R to be one of containment (during (E,R)),where the latter is defined as follows: (x,y) iff U t (t X ---&gt; e y) The fact that E is contained in R is meant to be the formal counterpart of the intuition that E is seen as a single unanalyzable whole from the point of view defined by R. (ii) imperfective: This is subdivided into three classes: (ii.i) durative: contain (E,R), defined as in 2.1. (focus on the continuation) (ii.ii) inchoative: since (E,R), definition: iff x 0 3 t&apos; V t e time (t e x &amp; t&apos; 3 t e time 01 t&apos; e time (t e x &amp; t&apos; e y the beginning of E) Until (E,R), definition: iff x 0 3 t e time t&apos; e time (t e x &amp; t&apos; ---) t&lt;t&apos;) 3 t&apos; V t e time (t e x &amp; t&apos; e y (focus on the ending of E) (iii) retrospective: The relation is simply before (E,R). Some authors also distinguish a socalled &apos;prospective aspect (cf. Comrie 1976). It seems to be less common than the other ones, and there is some disagreement on the issue of what its language specific counterparts are (&apos;to be going to&apos; ?), but conceptually it can be defined fairly easily, namely as the complement of the retrospective aspect: (iv) prospective: after (E,R) The interval E can be specified by adverbials. One class of E-specifiers is the class of duration adverbials. The reasons for treating these adverbials as E-specifiers are the following ones : 1. they always denote the interval at which the basic proposition is said to take place; in that respect they are different from the when-adverbials, since the latter can also denote a time that does not coincide with the event time (cf. the non-perfective aspects). 2. they cannot be combined with all possible propositions; they are, for instance, not compatible with momentaneous events: reached the summit for a while The ungrammaticality of (11) can be explained if we take the duration adverbials to specify the event time, since the latter cannot be both a moment (as required by the proposition) and an interval of some duration (as required by the adverbial). 3. they never have a deictic function: they are not used for specifying the relation between some interval and the.moment of speech. As in the case of the when-adverbials it is possible to have two duration adverbials in the same clause: (12) he has been studying two hours a day since his childhood now Notice, however, that (12) has an iterative interpretation, and since the treatment of such interpretations requires a more elaborated representation scheme anyway, we can stick to the principle that a clause contains at most one E-specifier. In this case the E-specifier is &apos;since his childhood&apos;: &apos;two hours&apos; is another type of specifier (cf. Van Eynde, forthcoming). 2.3. The calculus as a whole. In the preceding sections it has been stipulated that there are three possible relations between S and R, and six possible relations between R and E. At first sight that seems to be rather arbitrary, but a careful analysis of the concepts involved shows that they, in fact, exhaust the range of logical possibilities : For any two intervals x and y S time, x = 0 and then either before(x,y) or after(x,y) These are the six aspectual values. The reason why the deictic system has only three possible values is that the speech time unlike the reference and the event time is always a singleton, and if one of the intervals involved is a singleton, then the relations &apos;since&apos; and and either &apos;during&apos; or &apos;contain&apos; definition. It appears, thus, that the deictic and the aspectual distinctions are not only mutually exclusive but also exhaustive within their respective domains. Together they form the core of the temporal calculus. This core has to be extended in various ways if one wants to take into account the phenomenon of iterativity, the sequence of tenses in complex sentences, and the relevance of the event type of the basic proposition (cf. Vendler&apos;s distinction of x 0 and then either x 6 y, i.e. during(x,y) ft(x then either x i.e. contain(x,y; or •-(x y) then or until 38 states, activities, accomplishments, achievements). Part of this has already been incorporated in the formalism, but in stead of presenting those extensions we think it more useful to round off this paper with a demonstration of how the calculus can be used for the interlingual analysis of verbal tense forms. 3. The interlinoual analysis of tenses. For the interlingual analysis of the verbal tense forms we adopt the following principle: (VII) The interlingual representations of verbal tense forms are pairs consisting of one deictic and one aspectual value. As the number of possible combinations of and aspectual values is 18 it follows that each tense form can have at most 18 different interlingual representations. In order to determine which values a given tense can actually have one has to examine its compatibility with the different types of time adverbials. As for the deictic subpart, it is not so difficult to invent a criterion: (i) If tense X is compatible with a deictic where Y before, contain), then the tense X can have the For the aspectual subpart the criteria are a bit more complicated: tii) If tense X can be used in a sentence with a when-adverbial in which the event is said to take place before or after the interval denoted by that when-adverbial. then the aspectual value of X can be either &apos;before&apos; or &apos;after&apos;, i.e. X can be used to express either retrospectivity or prospectivity. (iii) If tense X can be used in a sentence which contains both a when-adverbial and a duration adverbial that denotes an interval that is larger than the interval denoted by the when-adverbial, then tense X can be used to express the durative aspect. Similar criteria have to be stated for the other aspects (inchoative, terminative, and perfective). As far as we can see now the perfective aspect might well be considered to be the default value: from a conceptual point of view the least marked situation the which the event time is contained in or identical with the reference time (E c R or E = R). As an illustration of how these criteria can be used in practice we give an interlingual analysis of the Dutch &apos;Voltooid Tegenwoordige Tijd (VTT)&apos;. This tense is expressed by the of an auxiliary or &apos;zijn&apos;) and the perfect participle of a lexical verb. The VTT can be combined with all kinds of when-adverbial 5: (13) nu heb ik het gevonden now-have-I-it-found (14) morgen heb ik het gevonden tomorrow-have-I-it-found (15) gisteren heb ik het gevonden yesterday-have-I-it-found In (13) and (14) the time of event precedes the time denoted by resp. &amp;quot;nu&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;morgen&amp;quot;; the aspectual value of VTT in these sentences is the retrospective one. fact, and (14) to a paradigm of retrospective tenses. The other members of the paradigm are the &amp;quot;Voltooid Verleden and the °Voltooid Toekomende as in (16) gisteren had ik het al gevonden yesterday-had-I-it-already-found (17) morgen zal ik het gevonden hebben tomorrow-shall-I-it-found-have and have the same meaning and, hence, the same interlingual representation, the combination before. has the value before,and the value before. (15) the situation is different: here, time of finding does not precede the interval denoted by &amp;quot;yesterday&amp;quot; (as in (16)), but is rather contained in it. The aspectual value of the VTT in (16) is hence the perfective one, and the interlingual representation in that case during. It can further be shown that the VTT cannot be used to express a durative aspect. Compare (18) gisteren ben ik de hele dag ziek geweest (19) * gisteren ben ik drie dagen ziek geweest yesterday-am-I-three-days-ill-been In (18) the event time denoted by the duration adverbial &amp;quot;de hele dag&amp;quot; is a subset of the interval denoted by &amp;quot;gisteren&amp;quot; (= perfective aspect); in (19), on the other hand, the event time (three days) is said to be longer than the reference time (one day). Since this 39 combination leads to ungrammaticality (in Dutch), it follows that the VTT cannot express durativity. If these analyses are correct, it follows that the Dutch VII can have three distinct interrepresentations: before, before,and during. The general idea now is that this information is contained in the lexicon, and that for the assignment of temporal representations to particular sentences one first looks in the lexicon to see which interlingual representations the tense used in that particular sentence can have, and then singles out that subset of representations which is compatible with the time adverbials used in the sentence. If that subset contains exactly one member the sentence may be said to be unambiguous with respect to the temporal calculus; if the subset contains more members, the sentence is said to be temporally ambiguous; and if the subset is empty, the sentence is simply not well-formed. As a conclusion to this section we give the representations of some of the discussed sentences (13) 3 S,R,E S time (contain(R,S) &amp; nu(R) &amp; before(E,R) &amp; AT (E, ik het vinden)) (15) 3 S,R,E S time (before(R,S) &amp; gisteren(R) &amp; during(E,R) &amp; AT(E, ik het vinden)) (18) 3 S,R,E S time (before(R,S) &amp; gisteren(R) &amp; during(E,R) &amp; de hele dag(E) &amp; AT(E, ik ziek zijn)) 4. Prospects. In this paper we have concentrated on the definition of a conceptual calculus for the representation of time meanings in natural language. We have also given principles (IV,V,V1,VII) and criteria (i,ii,iii) for relating the concepts of the calculus to language specific morphosyntactic categories. Given these tools, it should be possible to analyse the tenses of the different languages in such a way that the results of the analysis are comparable and, indeed, identical iff they express the same concept. It goes without saying that the actual analysis of all possible tenses cannot be carried out in a paper of this size, but we have the feeling that we have at least cleared the ground for such an enterprise.
