<bodyText confidence="0.999752">
Metalanguage is an essential linguistic
mechanism which allows us to communicate
explicit information about language itself.
However, it has been underexamined in
research in language technologies, to the
detriment of the performance of systems that
could exploit it. This paper describes the
creation of the first tagged and delineated
corpus of English metalanguage, accompanied
by an explicit definition and a rubric for
identifying the phenomenon in text. This
resource will provide a basis for further studies
of metalanguage and enable its utilization in
language technologies.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997955428571428">
In order to understand the language that we speak,
we sometimes must refer to the language itself.
Language users do this through an understanding
of the use-mention distinction, as exhibited by the
mechanism of metalanguage: that is, language that
describes language. The use-mention distinction is
illustrated simply in Sentences (1) and (2) below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9935575">
(1) I watch football on weekends.
(2) Football may refer to one of several sports.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999302142857143">
A reader understands that football in Sentence (1)
refers to a sporting activity, while the same word in
Sentence (2) refers to the term football itself.
Evidence suggests that human communication
frequently employs metalanguage (Anderson et al.
2002), and the phenomenon is essential for many
activities, including the introduction of new

Recognizing a wide variety of metalinguistic
constructions is a skill that humans take for granted
in fellow interlocutors (Perlis, Purang &amp; Andersen
1998), and it is a core language skill that children
demonstrate at an early age (Clark &amp; Schaefer
1989). Regardless of context, topic, or mode of
communication (spoken or written), we are able to
refer directly to language, and we expect others to
recognize and understand when we do so.
The study of the syntax and semantics of
metalanguage is well developed for formal
languages. However, the study of the phenomenon
in natural language is relatively nascent, and its
incorporation into language technologies is almost
non-existent. Parsing the distinction is difficult, as
shown in Figure 1 below: go does not function as a
verb in Sentence (6), but it is tagged as such.
Delineating an instance of metalanguage with
quotation marks is a common convention, but this
often fails to ameliorate the parsing problem.
Quotation marks, italic text, and bold text—three
common conventions used to highlight
metalanguage—are inconsistently applied and are
already “overloaded” with several distinct uses.
Moreover, applications of natural language
processing generally lack the ability to recognize
and interpret metalanguage (Anderson et al. 2002).

Systems using sentiment analysis are affected, as
sentiment-suggestive terms appearing in
metalanguage (especially in quotation, a form of
the phenomenon (Maier 2007)) are not necessarily
reflective of the writer or speaker. Applications of
natural language understanding cannot process
metalanguage without detecting it, especially when
upstream components (such as parsers) mangle its
structure. Interactive systems that could leverage
users’ expectations of metalanguage competency
currently fail to do so. Figure 2 below shows a
fragment of conversation with the Let’s Go! (Raux
et al. 2005) spoken dialog system, designed to help
users plan trips on Pittsburgh’s bus system.

The exchange shown in Figure 2 is
representative of the reactions of nearly all dialog
systems: in spite of the domain generality of
metalanguage and the user’s expectation of its
availability, the system does not recognize it and
instead “talks past” the user. In effect, language
technologies that ignore metalanguage are
discarding the most direct source of linguistic
information that text or utterances can provide.
This paper describes the first substantial study to
characterize and gather instances of English
metalanguage. Section 2 presents a definition and a
rubric for metalanguage in the form of mentioned
language. Section 3 describes the procedure used
to create the corpus and some notable properties of
its contents, and Section 4 discusses insights
gained into the phenomenon. The remaining
sections discuss the context of these results and
future directions for this research.

2 Metalanguage and the Use-Mention
Distinction1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998005882353">
Although the reader is likely to be familiar with the
terms use-mention distinction and metalanguage,
the topic merits further explanation to precisely
establish the phenomenon being studied.
Intuitively, the vast majority of utterances are
produced for use rather than mention, as the roles
of language-mention are auxiliary (albeit
indispensible) to language use. This paper will
adopt the term mentioned language to describe the
literal, delineable phenomenon illustrated in
examples thus far. Other forms of metalanguage
occur through deictic references to linguistic
entities that do not appear in the relevant statement.
(For example, consider “That word was
misspelled” where the referred-to word resides
outside of the sentence.) For technical tractability,
this study focuses on mentioned language.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.964779">
2.1 Definition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993442357142857">
Although the use-mention distinction has enjoyed a
long history of theoretical discussion, attempts to
explicitly define one or both of the distinction’s
disjuncts are difficult (or impossible) to find.
Below is the definition of mentioned language
adopted by this study, followed by clarifications.
Definition: For T a token or a set of tokens in a
sentence, if T is produced to draw attention to a
property of the token T or the type of T, then T is
an instance of mentioned language.
Here, a token is the specific, situated (i.e., as
appearing in the sentence) instantiation of a
linguistic entity: a letter, symbol, sound, word,
phrase, or another related entity. A property might

introduced by Wilson (2011a). For brevity, their full
justifications and the argument for equivalence between the

be a token’s spelling, pronunciation, meaning (for
a variety of interpretations of meaning), structure,
connotation, original source (in cases of quotation),
or another aspect for which language is shown or
demonstrated. The type of T is relevant in most
instances of mentioned language, but the token
itself is relevant in others, as in the sentence below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.954504">
(9) “The” appears between quote marks here.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.950369181818182">
Constructions like (9) are unusual and are of
limited practical value, but the definition
accommodates them for completeness.
The adoption of this definition was motivated by
a desire to study mentioned language with precise,
repeatable results. However, it was too abstract to
consistently apply to large quantities of candidate
phrases in sentences, a necessity for corpus
creation. A brief attempt to train annotators using
the definition was unsuccessful, and instead a
rubric was created for this purpose.

2.2 Annotation Rubric
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999782666666667">
A human reader with some knowledge of the use-
mention distinction can often intuit the presence of
mentioned language in a sentence. However, to
operationalize the concept and move toward corpus
construction, it was necessary to create a rubric for
labeling it. The rubric is based on substitution, and
it may be applied, with caveats described below, to
determine whether a linguistic entity is mentioned
by the sentence in which it occurs.
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.643249666666667">
Rubric: Suppose X is a linguistic entity in a
sentence S. Construct sentence S&apos; as follows:
replace X in S with a phrase X&apos; of the form &amp;quot;that
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.889654785714286">
[item]&amp;quot;, where [item] is the appropriate term for X
in the context of S (e.g., &amp;quot;letter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;symbol&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;phrase&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot;, etc.). X is an
instance of mentioned language if, when assuming
that X&apos; refers to X, the meaning of S&apos; is equivalent
to the meaning of S.
To further operationalize the rubric, Figure 3
shows it rewritten in pseudocode form. To verify
the rubric, the reader can follow a positive example
and a negative example in Figure 4.
To maintain coherency, minor adjustments in
sentence wording will be necessary for some
candidate phrases. For instance, Sentence (10)
below must be rewritten as (11):

(10) The word cat is spelled with three letters.
(11) Cat is spelled with three letters.

3 The Mentioned Language Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998955">
“Laboratory examples” of mentioned language
(such as the examples thus far in this paper) only
begin to illustrate the variation in the phenomenon.
To conduct an empirical examination of mentioned
language and to study the feasibility of automatic
identification, it was necessary to gather a large,
diverse set of samples. This section describes the
process of building a series of three progressively
more sophisticated corpora of mentioned language.
The first two were previously constructed by
Wilson (2010; 2011b) and will be described only
briefly. The third was built with insights from the
first two, and it will be described in greater detail.
This third corpus is the first to delineate mentioned
language: that is, it identifies precise subsequences
of words in a sentence that are subject to the
phenomenon. Doing so will enable analysis of the
syntax and semantics of English metalanguage.

3.1 Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99440225">
The article set of English Wikipedia2 was chosen as
a source for text, from which instances were mined
using a combination of automated and manual
efforts. Four factors led to its selection:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.835844037037037">
1) Wikipedia is collaboratively written. Since any
registered user can contribute to articles,
Wikipedia reflects the language habits of a large
sample of English writers (Adler et al. 2008).
2) Stylistic cues that sometimes delimit mentioned
language are present in article text.
Contributors tend to use quote marks, italic text,
or bold text to delimit mentioned language3, thus
following conventions respected across many
domains of writing (Strunk &amp; White 1979;
Chicago Editorial Staff 2010; American
Psychological Association. 2001). Discussion

or follow the conventions out of habit.
boards and other sources of informal language
were considered, but the lack of consistent (or
any) stylistic cues would have made candidate
phrase collection untenably time-consuming.
3) Articles are written to introduce a wide variety
of concepts to the reader. Articles are written
informatively and they generally assume the
reader is unfamiliar with their topics, leading to
frequent instances of mentioned language.
4) Wikipedia is freely available. Various language
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999549571428571">
learning materials were also considered, but
legal and technical obstacles made them
unsuitable for creating a freely available corpus.
To construct each of the three corpora, a general
procedure was followed. First, a set of current
article revisions was downloaded from Wikipedia.
Then, the main bodies of article text (excluding
discussion pages, image captions, and other
peripheral text) were scanned for sentences that
contained instances of highlighted text (i.e., text
inside of the previously mentioned stylistic cues).
Since stylistic cues are also used for other language
tasks, candidate instances were heuristically
filtered and then annotated by human readers.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998815">
3.2 Previous Efforts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981025">
In previous work, a pilot corpus was constructed to
verify the fertility of Wikipedia as a source for
mentioned language. From 1,000 articles, 1,339
sentences that contained stylistic cues were
examined by a human reader, and 171 were found
to contain at least one instance of mentioned
language. Although this effort verified Wikipedia’s
viability for the project, it also revealed that the
hand-labeling procedure was time-consuming, and
prior heuristic filtering would be necessary.
Next, the “Combined Cues” corpus was
constructed to test the combination of stylistic
filtering and a new lexical filter for selecting
candidate instances. A set of 23 “mention-
significant” words was gathered informally from
the pilot corpus, consisting of nouns and verbs:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.5134076">
Nouns: letter, meaning, name, phrase,
pronunciation, sentence, sound, symbol, term, title,
word
Verbs: ask, call, hear, mean, name, pronounce,
refer, say, tell, title, translate, write
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.97916225">
Instances of highlighted text were only
promoted to the hand annotation stage if they
contained at least one of these words within the
three-word phrase directly preceding the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994603">

<bodyText confidence="0.999897692307692">
highlighted text. From 3,831 articles, a set of 898
sentences were found to contain 1,164 candidate
instances that passed the combination of stylistic
and lexical filters. Hand annotation of those
candidates yielded 1,082 instances of mentioned
language. Although the goal of the filters was only
to ease hand annotation, it could be stated that the
filters had almost 93% precision in detecting the
phenomenon. It did not seem plausible that the set
of mention-significant words was complete enough
to justify that high percentage, and concerns were
raised that the lexical filter was rejecting many
instances of mentioned language.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997425">
3.3 The “Enhanced Cues” Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932742851851852">
The construction of the present corpus (referred to
as the “Enhanced Cues” Corpus) was similar to
previous efforts but used a much-enlarged set of
mention-significant nouns and verbs gathered from
the Wordlet (Fellbaum 1998) lexical ontology.
For each of the 23 original mention-significant
words, a human reader started with its containing
synset and followed hypernym links until a synset
was reached that did not refer to a linguistic entity.
Then, backtracking one synset, all lemmas of all
descendants of the most general linguistically-
relevant synset were gathered. Figure 5 illustrates
this procedure with an example.
Figure 5: Gathering mention-significant words
from WordNet using the seed noun “term”. Here,
“Language unit”, “word”, “syllable”, “anagram”,
and all their descendants are gathered.
Using the combination of stylistic and lexical
cues, 2,393 candidate instances were collected, and
the researcher used the rubric and definition from
Section 2 to identify 629 instances of mentioned
language 4 . The researcher also identified four
categories of mentioned language based on the
nature of the substitution phrase X’ specified by
the rubric. These categories will be discussed in
the following subsection. Figure 6 summarizes this
procedure and the numeric outcomes.

As stated previously, categories for mentioned
language were identified based on intuitive
relationships among the substitution phrases
created for the rubric (e.g., “that word”, “that title”,
“that symbol”). The categories are:
1) Words as Words (WW): Within the context of
the sentence, the candidate phrase is used to
refer to the word or phrase itself and not what it
usually refers to.

Table 1 presents the frequencies of each category
in the Enhanced Cues corpus, and Table 2 provides
examples for each from the corpus. WW was by
far the most common label to appear, which is
perhaps an artifact of the use of Wikipedia as the
text source. Although Wikipedia articles contain
many names, NN was not as common, and
informal observations suggested that names and
titles are not as frequently introduced via
metalanguage. Instead, their referents are
introduced directly by the first appearance of the
referring text. Spelling and pronunciation were
particularly sparse; again, a different source might
have yielded more examples for this category. The
OM category was occupied mostly by instances of
speech or language production by an agent, as

In the interest of revealing both lexical and

the ten most common words (as POS-tagged) in

not intended to function as a classifier, figures for

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801705882353">
To provide some indication of the reliability and
consistency of the Enhanced Cues Corpus, three
additional expert annotators were recruited to label
a subset of the candidate instances. These
additional annotators received guidelines for
annotation that included the five categories, and
they worked separately (from each other and from
the primary annotator) to label 100 instances
selected randomly with quotas for each category.
Calculations first were performed to determine
the level of agreement on the mere presence of
mentioned language, by mapping labels WW, NN,
SP, and OM to true and XX to false. All four
annotators agreed upon a true label for 46
instances and a false label for 30 instances, with an
average pairwise Kappa (computed via NTLK) of
0.74. Kappa between the primary annotator and a

labeled by additional annotators and the values of
the Kappa statistic for binary relabelings.
The low value for remapped OM was expected,
since the category was small and intentionally not
well-defined. The relatively low value for WW
was not expected, though it seems possible that the
redaction of specific stylistic cues made annotators
less certain when to apply this category. Overall,
these numbers suggest that, although annotators
tend to agree whether a candidate instance is
mentioned language or not, there is less of a
consensus on how to qualify positive instances.

<bodyText confidence="0.999866153846154">
The Enhanced Cues corpus confirms some of the
hypothesized properties of metalanguage and
yields some unexpected insights. Stylistic cues
appear to be strongly associated with mentioned
language; although the examination of candidate
phrases was limited to “highlighted” text, informal
perusal of the remainder of article text confirmed
this association. Further evidence can be seen in
examples from other texts, shown below with their
original stylistic cues intact:
 Like so many words, the meaning of “addiction”
has varied wildly over time, but the trajectory
might surprise you.5

However, the connection between mentioned
language and stylistic cues is only valuable when
stylistic cues are available. Still, even in their
absence there appears to be an association between
mentioned language and a core set of nouns and
verbs. Recurring patterns were observed in how
mention-significant words related to mentioned
language. Two were particularly common:

One notable exception was a study by Anderson
et al. (2004), who created a corpus of
metalanguage from a subset of the British National
Corpus, finding that approximately 11% of spoken
utterances contained some form (whether explicit
or implicit) of metalanguage. However, limitations
in the Anderson corpus’ structure (particularly lack
of word- or phrase-level annotations) and content
(the authors admit it is noisy) served as compelling
reasons to start afresh and create a richer resource.

6 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977466666667">
As explained in the introduction, the long-term
goal of this research program is to apply an
understanding of metalanguage to enhance
language technologies. However, the more
immediate goal for creating this corpus was to
enable (and to begin) progress in research on
metalanguage. Between these long-term and
immediate goals lies an intermediate step: methods
must be developed to detect and delineate
metalanguage automatically.
Using the Enhanced Cues Corpus, a two-stage
approach to automatic identification of mentioned
language is being developed. The first stage is
detection, the determination of whether a sentence
contains an instance of mentioned language.
Preliminary results indicate that approximately
70% of instances can be detected using simple
machine learning methods (e.g., bag of words input
to a decision tree). The remaining instances will
require more advanced methods to detect, such as
word sense disambiguation to validate occurrences
of mention-significant words. The second stage is
delineation, the determination of the subsequence
of words in a sentence that functions as mentioned
language. Early efforts have focused on the
associations discussed in Section 5 between
mentioned language and mention-significant words.
The total number of such associations appears to
be small, making their collection a tractable
activity.

Parsing the distinction is difficult, as shown in Figure 1 below: go does not function as a verb in Sentence (6), but it is tagged as such. Delineating an instance of metalanguage with quotation marks is a common convention, but this often fails to ameliorate the parsing problem. Quotation marks, italic text, and bold text—three common conventions used to highlight metalanguage—are inconsistently applied and are already “overloaded” with several distinct uses. Moreover, applications of natural language processing generally lack the ability to recognize and interpret metalanguage (Anderson et al. 2002).

It did not seem plausible that the set of mention-significant words was complete enough to justify that high percentage, and concerns were raised that the lexical filter was rejecting many instances of mentioned language. 3.3 The “Enhanced Cues” Corpus The construction of the present corpus (referred to as the “Enhanced Cues” Corpus) was similar to previous efforts but used a much-enlarged set of mention-significant nouns and verbs gathered from the Wordlet (Fellbaum 1998) lexical ontology. For each of the 23 original mention-significant words, a human reader started with its containing synset and followed hypernym links until a synset was reached that did not refer to a linguistic entity. Then, backtracking one synset, all lemmas of all descendants of the most general linguisticallyrelevant synset were gathered. Figure 5 illustrates this procedure with an example.

For this discussion, quotation marks 640 and other stylistic cues are considered informal cues which aid a reader in detecting mentioned language. Style conventions may call for them, and in some cases they might be strictly necessary, but a competent language user possesses sufficient skill to properly discard or retain them as each instance requires (Saka 1998). 3 The Mentioned Language Corpus “Laboratory examples” of mentioned language (such as the examples thus far in this paper) only begin to illustrate the variation in the phenomenon.
