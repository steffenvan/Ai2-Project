&amp;quot;MIT Cog Net is an important new venture that brings together many
different resources for the cognitive and brain sciences. By bringing
information directly to researchers and students and allowing rapid
dissemination of important new research directions, CogNet by-
passes the slow and expensive efforts in the commercial publishing
world. A new model for how scientific publishing will look in the
twenty-first century is already being tested today in CogNet:&apos;

While respecting its historical link with the field of MT, Machine
Translation is changing and broadening its scope of interest to
encompass all branches of Computational Linguistics and Lan-
guage Engineering, wherever they incorporate a MULTILINGUAL
aspect. We therefore welcome submissions to the journal on
THEORETICAL, DESCRIPTIVE OR COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS
of any of the following topics:
+ machine translation and machine-aided translation + human
translation theory and practise + multilingual text composition and
generation + multilingual information retrieval + multilingual natural
language interfaces + multilingual dialogue systems + multilingual
message understanding systems + corpus-based and statistical
language modelling + connectionist approaches to translation
+ compilation and use of bi- and multilingual corpora + discourse
phenomena and their treatment in (human or machine) translation
1- knowledge engineering + contrastive linguistics + morphology,
syntax, semantics, pragmatics + computer-aided language
instruction and learning + software localization and
internationalization + speech processing, especially for speech
translation + phonetics, phonology + computational implications of
non-Roman character sets + multilingual word-processing
+ the multilingual information society (sociological and legal as well
as linguistic aspects) + minority languages + history of machine
translation. We would also welcome your suggestions about other
features you would like to see in this journal, for example, special
issues, squibs, topical comment.

Please immediately notify the ACL Office of address and email changes. Journal copies returned due to bad
addresses will not be remailed until a $5.00 postage/handling fee is remitted. E-mail (if available) is used to
distribute meeting, membership, and other announcements.
MEMBERSHIP in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues
are paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at
most ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Payments for membership dues,
fund donations, back issues, and proceedings may be made in Europe or the USA. Important Note: Renewals must
be received no later than 1 April 2001 to avoid late payment fee (for postage/handling) assessment. Membership
categories include Regular Members (for 1, 3 or 5 years) and the following: Couples with the same mailing address
may be Joint Members (for 1, 3, or 5 years); they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible
for all other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may
become Student Members with copy of current student ID. Students who are not Student Members because of their
income can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Also available are Retired and Unemployed
memberships. If no indication is provided of multi-year membership preference, one-year membership will be
presumed for Regular and Joint. Late payment fee does not apply to new memberships.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98054903125">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers (Short or Long), Letters to
the Editor, Squibs and Discussions):
Papers report significant new research results in computational linguistics. Each paper is re-
viewed by at least two experts in the field. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing
means that it has not been copyrighted, has not been published in or submitted for publication
to another refereed archival publication, and has not appeared in any conference or workshop
proceedings. The submitted manuscript must be available for peer review without restriction.
If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in any other publication, the details of
such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version
of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer
Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer.
This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must
be written in English. Guidelines for electronic submission and style files are available from
http://www.aclweb.org/cl/. Submissions should be specified by the submitter as a submission
to one of two categories, Short Papers or Long Papers, and must include word counts. Papers
in these two categories will be reviewed by slightly different procedures:
Short Papers, of no more than 15 journal pages (about 4000 words), will receive expedited review
by two reviewers. Such a paper might, for example, contain a description of a single experiment,
algorithm, or other technical result. Authors whose papers are accepted are expected to submit
final versions within 8 weeks of notification.
Long Papers, exceeding 15 journal pages, will receive standard review. Such a longer paper
might, for example, describe the results of a large research project or dissertation. These sub-
missions should normally not exceed 30 journal pages (about 8000 words).
All submissions, regardless of length, will be held to the same standards of technical and pre-
sentation quality.
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con-
tributions for inclusion.
For hard copy submissions, five copies of papers or three copies of letters should be sent to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing
Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed;
others are likely to be added.

<abstract confidence="0.890476363636364">Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers (Short or Long), Letters to the Editor, Squibs and Discussions): Papers report significant new research results in computational linguistics. Each paper is reviewed by at least two experts in the field. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that it has not been copyrighted, has not been published in or submitted for publication to another refereed archival publication, and has not appeared in any conference or workshop proceedings. The submitted manuscript must be available for peer review without restriction. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in any other publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire,&amp;quot; by the employer.</abstract>
<note confidence="0.933263">This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper</note>
<abstract confidence="0.967810235294118">should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must be written in English. Guidelines for electronic submission and style files are available from http://www.aclweb.org/cl/. Submissions should be specified by the submitter as a submission to one of two categories, Short Papers or Long Papers, and must include word counts. Papers in these two categories will be reviewed by slightly different procedures: Short Papers, of no more than 15 journal pages (about 4000 words), will receive expedited review by two reviewers. Such a paper might, for example, contain a description of a single experiment, algorithm, or other technical result. Authors whose papers are accepted are expected to submit final versions within 8 weeks of notification. Long Papers, exceeding 15 journal pages, will receive standard review. Such a longer paper might, for example, describe the results of a large research project or dissertation. These submissions should normally not exceed 30 journal pages (about 8000 words). All submissions, regardless of length, will be held to the same standards of technical and presentation quality. Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these contributions for inclusion.</abstract>

A European chapter was established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing Linguistics, ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; are likely to added.</abstract>
