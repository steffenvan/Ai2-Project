inferences are generated, how many inferences are
generated, and what knowledge sources contribute to the
generation of inferences.
In their book Structures and Procedures of Implicit
Knowledge, Graesser and Clark, two psychologists,
attempt to answer these questions by presenting a model
of comprehension that primarily focuses on knowledge-
based inferences (viz, products of what the comprehen-
der knows about the world).
The likelihood of a particular inference depends on the
content of the inference, together with (a) the text&apos;s
context, (b) world knowledge structures and inference
engines that are available, (c) the goals of the compre-
hender, and (d) the pragmatic context of the communi-
cation act. Admittedly, this is too much to handle at
once, and the authors do not wait until the last section of
the book to clearly state the goals and limitations of their
work. There is no discussion of syntactic parsing, no
formal theory of meaning, and no pragmatic model. This
is not a book about linguistics but rather about conceptu-
al modeling and, specifically, about the generation and
usage of knowledge-based inferences during text compre-
hension. The authors are quick to point out that formal
work in linguistics, logic, and philosophy, as well as Al
research, ignore &amp;quot;important characteristics .of human
cognition&amp;quot;. Implicitly, researchers in those fields are
invited to momentarily leave their idealistic vacuums or
their Lisp code in order to refresh their knowledge about
text comprehension and psychological plausibility.
Though the book does not present an exhaustive
survey of the available research on inferences and text
comprehension, its concise discussion in the first chapter
of inference taxonomies and engines and its rich bibli-
ography make it an excellent reference.
Text comprehension is extremely complex, and the
authors can only offer a very partial yet quite interesting
solution: they propose procedures to model comprehen-
sion, recall, summarization, and question answering.
These procedures work on generic knowledge structures
(represented by conceptual graphs) that they traverse
and match in order to generate the inferences that make
the text coherent, as well as other inferences that capture
the comprehender&apos;s expectations. From a computational
point of view, since there is no implementation of the
model, the discussion may sometimes appear superficial.
Also, Graesser and Clark too often claim without any
further explanation that their model includes previous
work. As is usually the case for this domain of research,
since the stories analyzed must minimize the role of the
components left out of the model, the reader is
confronted with truly artificial and insipid texts.
Finally, be forewarned! The authors present a gener-
ous amount of statistics obtained from numerous exper-
iments; a great deal of time is spent analyzing the data
and defending the methodology. The reader may often
want to skip to the end of chapters, where good summa-
ries of the results and conclusions are provided.

John Sowa has written an excellent book. It is beautifully
written, and presents a clean, precise look at knowledge
representation and its applications. The book combines a
sweeping historical perspective from the ancients to
current research, with a formal definition of knowledge
representation structures.
The first two chapters provide the motivation and set
the tone for the rest of the book. They are a delight to
read. Chapter 1, &amp;quot;Philosophical Basis&amp;quot;, shows why
psychologists, linguists, philosophers, and computer
scientists are all interested in the problem of knowledge
representation, and how their perspectives on the prob-
lem overlap and differ. One finishes the chapter with an
understanding of the historical development in each of
the areas, and the interdisciplinary nature of the field.
Throughout, Sowa stresses the importance of formal
models, as opposed to ad hoc solutions. Chapter 2,
&amp;quot;Psychological Evidence&amp;quot;, surveys numerous psycholog-
ical experiments that illustrate the nature of human
language behavior. Modeling this behavior is the essential
problem of Al research. The chapter contains several
wonderful anecdotes â€” for example, the eidetic-memoried
Shereshevskii who lost his job as a newspaper reporter
because he could not abstract from detail.
At Chapter 3, &amp;quot;Conceptual Graphs&amp;quot;, we enter the
technical part of the book. This chapter is a fine intro-
duction to semantic net representation, which he calls
conceptual graphs. Conceptual graphs are a canonical
form of many AI knowledge representation schemes. In
the form he follows throughout the book, Sowa first
presents a general, understandable discussion of what is
to be represented and why, and follows with formal defi-
nitions. He covers all the fundamentals: concepts, gener-
alization and specialization, types and tokens,
aggregation and individualization. By the end of the
chapter we have a good intuitive understanding of the
representation, and a sound formal basis.
Chapter 4, &amp;quot;Reasoning and Computation&amp;quot;, proceeds
naturally from Chapter 3. We see larger organizations of
memory structures, and how they are used in reasoning
processes. He shows how logic can be represented in
graphs and how deduction can be performed on them.

Chapter 5 is on &amp;quot;Language&amp;quot;. Again, we have an excel-
lent, broad summary: child language abilities, strata of
language, case grammar, and generation. There is a nice
presentation of syntactic analysis. However, I would like
to see a deeper discussion of ATNs; here he just mentions
the phrase. The sections on context, and integrating
syntax and semantics are particularly well done.
Chapter 6, &amp;quot;Knowledge Engineering&amp;quot;, is a bit of a
grab bag. On expert systems, he mercifully avoids the
current hype by taking a &amp;quot;Just the facts, Ma&apos;am&amp;quot; atti-
tude. The other sections on natural language systems,
database semantics and inference, knowledge acquisition,
and learning are all informative, succinct descriptions of
basic problems and the current state of the art.
Chapter 7, &amp;quot;Limits of Conceptualization&amp;quot;, ends the
book with a description of the wonderful aspects of
human behavior that computers can&apos;t do at all. It is great
fun to read.
The potential audience for this book is extensive.
Because the chapters are organized with introductory
material at the beginning of each section and formal
descriptions later, readers may skip sections without
losing the thread of the book. A newcomer to AI can
read the first parts of each section, serious students can
read it all.
As a textbook, Conceptual Structures has both positive
and negative aspects. On the positive side, it gives an
historical perspective of many fields, presents a general,
formal definition of knowledge representation and its
uses, and contains good exercises. An additional bonus is
the conceptual catalog given in Appendix B. This is
exactly what students always ask for: a collection of
structures that can be used by programs. On the negative
side, specific Al systems are nowhere discussed in detail.
It would be necessary for the instructor to provide
supplementary material and original sources.
I agree with Clancy (1985) that &amp;quot;Every Al and Cogni-
tive Science researcher should study the conceptual graph
notation and understand its foundation in logic, database,
and knowledge representation research.&amp;quot;
