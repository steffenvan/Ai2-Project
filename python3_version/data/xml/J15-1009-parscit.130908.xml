The Web is the main source of data in modern computational linguistics. Other volumes
in the same series, for example, Introductions to Opinion Mining (Liu 2012) and Semi-
supervised Machine Learning (Søgaard 2013), start their problem statements by referring
to data from the Web. This volume starts its own introduction by praising Web corpora
for their size, ease of construction, and availability as a source of new text types.
A random check of papers from the most recent ACL meeting also shows that the
majority of them use Web data in one way or another. Our field definitely needs a
comprehensive overview and a DIY manual for the task of constructing a corpus from
the Web. This book is, to the best of my knowledge, the first attempt at providing such
an overview.
The book consists of an introduction and four chapters outlining the four main steps
of Web corpus construction. They include: “Data Collection” (Chapter 2), “Basic Corpus
Cleaning” (Chapter 3), “Linguistic Processing” (Chapter 4), and “Corpus Evaluation”
(Chapter 5).
Chapter 2 provides a very useful outline of the main properties of the Web and
the crawling strategies. The chapter starts with an overview of a large-scale study of
Web connectivity from Baeza-Yates, Castillo, and Efthimiadis (2007), listing various
parameters of connectivity for a range of Top-Level Domains. However, there is little
discussion of the implications for the corpus development task; for example, does the
difference of the in-degree parameter of the Web pages from Chile and the UK have
any implications for the Web corpora crawled from those domains? The chapter then
proceeds to another important topic, which concerns the parameters of crawling; for
example, the crawl bias and the number of seeds, and their influence on the final corpus.
Section 2.4.1 illustrates the problems with the crawl bias by an example of deWac, a
large commonly used corpus of German (Baroni et al. 2009). The second most frequent
proper name bigram in this corpus is found to be Falun Gong. However, more analysis
into the nature of the bias should have been beneficial. It is less likely to be related to the
PageRank bias, the main bias discussed in Section 2.4.2. Other most frequent bigrams
from deWac are not presented in the book, but it is interesting to note that the fourth
place in it is occupied by Hartz IV, and the tenth place by Digital Eyes. This suggests that
the bias comes from frequency spikes (i.e, a large number of instances collected from a
small number of Web sites). Another shortcoming of this chapter is that nothing is said
specifically about obtaining data from such resources as Twitter or Facebook, which
need access via APIs rather than direct crawling.

Chapter 3 introduces methods for basic cleaning of the corpus content, such as
processing of text formats (primarily HTML tags), language identification, boilerplate
removal, and deduplication. Such low-level tasks are not considered to be glamorous
from the view of computational linguistics, but they are extremely important for making
Web-derived corpora usable (Baroni et al. 2008). The introduction offered in this chapter
is reasonably complete, with good explanations of the sources of problems as well as
with suggestions for the tools to be used in each task. An important bit which is missing
in this chapter concerns the suggestions for choosing a particular cleaning pipeline.
Although the choice indeed depends on the purposes of corpus collection, an indication
of which pipeline suits which purpose is desirable.
Chapter 4 is devoted to basic steps for linguistic processing of Web corpora, such as
tokenization, POS tagging, and lemmatization, as well as orthographic normalization.
Even though the processing pipeline is roughly the same for all NLP tasks, it becomes
harder for Web corpora because they exhibit greater diversity in comparison with more
homogeneous text collections (e.g., WSJ texts). Web texts are also considerably noisier,
in the sense of containing nonstandard linguistic expressions, which are likely to be
a challenge to the tools trained on more standard texts. The chapter presents some
interesting case studies—in particular, the sources of POS tagging errors and non-
standard orthography.
Chapter 5 describes ways for evaluating and comparing corpora. It gives exam-
ples of checking for word and sentence length and for sentence-level duplication. It
also introduces methods for comparing frequency lists. Like other chapters it includes
many interesting observations, such as the methods for extrinsic evaluation of corpora.
However, the chapter does not address many issues important for corpus evaluation
and comparison. Given that the previous chapters introduced a number of pipelines
and corpora, this chapter would have been an ideal place to illustrate all the aspects of
the pipelines by evaluating them in a consistent way. There are occasional references to
this goal, such as the frequency lists of French nouns in Section 5.3.1, but this particular
comparison is fairly impressionistic, and it concludes with a declaration of basic similar-
ity of the underlying corpora. Does this mean that the crawling, cleaning, and linguistic
processing pipelines do not matter? In any case, not even an impressionistic comparison
of the pipelines is performed for other evaluation methods. Some illustrations are also
not informative (e.g., Table 5.1.1 shows two frequency lists with the identical ranks for
their words, which leads to the trivial rank correlation value of 1). The chapter contains
a single paragraph devoted to composition of Web corpora. Given the size of such
corpora, their evaluation crucially depends on understanding what has been crawled.
The task has been approached by a number of models, such as supervised and semi-
supervised classification, clustering, topic modeling, and so forth, which should have
been included in the discussion. The discussion does contain a relevant reference to
Mehler, Sharoff, and Santini (2010), which surveys approaches to the genres of the Web,
but other aspects of corpus composition need to be addressed, too.
Overall, it is very useful to have a book that introduces all the aspects of Web
corpus construction in a single volume with coherent presentation. The volume un-
der review does cover the entire range of topics relevant to Web corpus construction
and illustrates them via numerous examples. I would recommend it to students just
starting their corpus development experiments. As for the drawbacks of the volume,
there is a need to improve the structure of argumentation for the next edition. Bits of
information are sometimes introduced in an incomplete way and re-introduced again
in subsequent sections. For examples, two tools for crawling are discussed towards
the end of Section 2.3.3, while more tools are mentioned as the discussion of crawling

strategies progresses. Chapter 1 starts with a fairly random list of non-Web corpora,
whereas an overview of the book structure is confined to a short paragraph. Often,
frustratingly little information is provided besides an annotated bibliography, rather
than a presentation of the relevant methods and issues. In some cases this is accom-
panied with a statement that “covering this topic is beyond the scope of this volume,”
even if the nature of the problem and the solutions could have been easily explained in
a one-page summary. Another minor concern is an (understandable) emphasis on the
tools and corpora developed by the authors, primarily on their German corpus.
I have to admit ambivalence in my final verdict: The book is a useful introduction
to an important topic, but it definitely warrants a new edition, which eliminates the
shortcomings of the current one.
