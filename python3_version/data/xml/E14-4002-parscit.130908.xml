In this paper, we propose to build temporal
ontologies from WordNet. The underlying
idea is that each synset is augmented with
its temporal connotation. For that purpose,
temporal classifiers are iteratively learned
from an initial set of time-sensitive synsets
and different propagation strategies to give
rise to different TempoWordNets.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999938692307692">
Temporality has recently received increased at-
tention in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and Information Retrieval (IR). Initial works have
been proposed in NLP and are exhaustively sum-
marized in (Mani et al., 2005). More recently,
the introduction of the TempEval task (Verhagen
et al., 2009) in the Semantic Evaluation workshop
series has clearly established the importance of
time to deal with different NLP tasks. The ulti-
mate aim of research in this area is the automatic
identification of temporal expressions (timexes),
events and temporal relations within a text in the
TimeML format (Pustejovsky et al., 2005).
In IR, the time dimension has also received par-
ticular attention for the past few years. Accord-
ing to (Metzger, 2007), time is one of the key five
aspects that determine a document credibility be-
sides relevance, accuracy, objectivity and cover-
age. So, the value of information or its quality is
intrinsically time-dependent. As a consequence, a
new reasearch field called Temporal Information
Retrieval (T-IR) has emerged (Alonso et al., 2011)
and deals with all classical IR tasks such as crawl-
ing (Kulkarni et al., 2011), indexing (Anand et al.,
2012) or ranking (Kanhabua et al., 2011) from the
time viewpoint.
However, both NLP and IR evidence the lack
of temporal lexical resources. For example, auto-
matic temporal ordering of events in text is usu-
ally performed via various linguistic mechanisms
including the use of time expressions such as “be-
fore”,“after” or “during” that explicitly assert a
temporal relation. In particular, (Derczynski and
Gaizauskas, 2012) investigate the role of tempo-
ral signals in temporal relation extraction over the
TimeBank annotated corpus. However, the list of
such expressions is limited. From the IR view-
point, most methodologies rely on the presence of
explicit timexes and hardly bridge the gap when
no explicit mention of time is available. One re-
cent exception is proposed in (Jatowt et al., 2013)
where text time-tagging is seen as a classification
task, but no use of specific temporal clues is intro-
duced or proposed.
Inspired by SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebas-
tiani, 2006), we propose to introduce the tempo-
ral connotation of each synset in WordNet (Miller,
1995) by iteratively learning temporal classifiers
from an initial set of time-sensitive synsets and a
given propagation strategy. As such, each synset
is automatically time-tagged with four dimensions
i.e. atemporal, past, present and future, thus giv-
ing rise to different TempoWordNets depending
on the propagation strategy.
TempoWordNets are evaluated both manually
and automatically. First, results show that man-
ual annotation of time-tagged synsets is a hard
task for humans. Second, automatic evaluation
based on sentence temporal classification shows
that the introduction of time-augmented lexical
knowledge bases (TempoWordNets) allows 3.9%
improvements of Fi-measure against the vector
space model representation and 4.2% against the
semantic vector space model obtained with the ex-
isting WordNet time subtree.

2007). TempEval was initially divided into three
challenges: (A) identifying temporal relations be-
tween events and time expressions, (B) identifying
temporal relations between events and the docu-
ment creation time and (C) identifying the tem-
poral relations between contiguous pairs of matrix
verbs. In TempEval-2 (Pustejovsky and Verhagen,
2009), the best performing systems were based
on conditional random fields mixed with parsing
methodologies (UzZaman and Allen, 2010). More
recently, in TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al., 2013),
new systems have been performing at high level
of performance for all three tasks such as the
rule-based multilingual temporal tagger Heidel-
time (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2013). In IR, the work
of (Baeza-Yates, 2005) defines the foundations of
T-IR. Since, research have been tackling several
topics such as query understanding (Metzler et al.,
2009), temporal snippets generation (Alonso et al.,
2007), temporal ranking (Kanhabua et al., 2011),
temporal clustering (Alonso et al., 2009), future
retrieval (Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013) or tempo-
ral image retrieval (Dias et al., 2012).
As expressed in (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2013),
time taggers usually contain pattern files with
words and phrases, which are typically used to
express temporal expressions in a given language
(e.g. names of months). In fact, most temporal
NLP tasks rely on a time-sensitive vocabulary. On
the contrary, T-IR systems usually do not use in-
formation about time in language although they
could benefit from it when facing the recurrent
problem of missing explicit timexes.
WordNet is a good place to start to find time-
sensitive concepts. Indeed, one can list a set
of 21 temporal synsets by iteratively following
the hyponym relation from the concept of time
(synset # 00028270) represented by the follow-
ing gloss: the continuum of experience in which
events pass from the future through the present to
the past. However, likewise the tennis problem ev-
idenced in (Fellbaum, 1998), most temporal words
are not under the concept of time. For example,
concepts such as “prediction”, “remember”, “an-
cient” or “fresh” clearly have a time dimension al-
though they are not listed under the time subtree
of WordNet. Based on the intial ideas of (Moens
and Steedman, 1987) on temporal ontologies and
inspired by SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani,
2006), we propose to enrich all WordNet synsets
with their temporal connotation.

3 TempoWordNet as SentiWordNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964517241379">
In (Dias et al., 2014), we first proposed to build
TempoWordNet based on the idea of (Esuli and
Sebastiani, 2006) for SentiWordNet. Each synset
is automatically time-tagged with four dimensions
i.e. atemporal, past, present and future by per-
forming a two-step process.
A first temporal classifier is built based on a set
of manually selected seed synsets and their corre-
sponding glosses tagged as past, present and fu-
ture. This process is then iterated based on the
repetitive lexico-semantic expansion) of the initial
seeds lists until cross-validation accuracy drops.
This first step results in a three-class temporal
classifier and an expanded list of temporal synset
candidates.
A second temporal classifier is then learned to
time-tag synsets as atemporal or temporal. This
process is obtained by taking the final list of ex-
panded seed synsets from the previous learning
problem and randomly choosing a balanced num-
ber atemporal synsets. A 10-fold cross-validation
is then used to learn the model.
TempoWordNet is finally obtained by (1) classi-
fying all WordNet synsets as atemporal or tempo-
ral with the second classifier and (2) the resulting
temporal synsets are tagged as past, present and
future by the first classifier. This step is detailed in
(Dias et al., 2014) and all materials can be found
at http://tempowordnet.greyc.fr.

4 Diversified Expansion Strategies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955662888888889">
The initial strategy proposed in the previous sec-
tion evidences a clear lack. As the expansion pro-
cess is semantically driven, the temporal conno-
tation is highly depend on the initial seeds lists
and as a consequence may not spread over a wide
range of concepts in WordNet. As such, we pro-
pose two different strategies of expansion: (1) the
probabilistic expansion and (2) the hybrid (proba-
bilistic combined with semantic) expansion.
Probabilistic Expansion: We first learn a tem-
poral vs. atemporal classifier based on the ini-
tial hand-crafted set of seeds proposed in (Dias
et al., 2014). In particular, the seeds defined as
past, present and future are markers of temporal-
ity, while the list of atemporal synsets is the ob-
vious counterpart. Based on this list of tempo-
&apos;Only exisiting lexico-semantic links in WordNet are used
to propagate the temporal connotation.

ral and atemporal synsets, a 10-fold cross vali-
dation process is performed to learn the temporal
vs. atemporal model, which is used to time-tag
the whole WordNet. The synsets (or glosses) with
highest temporal and atemporal values in Word-
Net are then used for the expansion process of the
seeds lists. The process is iteratively performed
and stops when accuracy drops.
After building the temporal vs. atemporal clas-
sifier, WordNet is divided into two subsets: tem-
poral synsets and atemporal ones. In order to
fine tune the temporal part of WordNet, we learn
a three-class classifier (i.e. past, present and fu-
ture) based on the initial past, present and future
seeds lists and the probabilistic expansion exclu-
sively2 within the temporal part of WordNet. So, a
10-fold cross validation process is iteratively per-
formed until accuracy drops.
The results of the probabilistic expansion are
presented in Table 1 and Table 2, when the expan-
sion is based on the maximum probability value3.

Note that in our experiment, Support Vector
Machines (SVM) with a linear kernel4 over the
vector space model representation of the synsets
(i.e. each synset is represented by its gloss en-
coded as a vector of unigrams weighted by their
frequency) have been used to classify all the
synsets of WordNet. The results show that in both
cases the expansion process stops at iteration 2.

2Only temporal synsets are classified as past, present or
future and used for the expansion process. Note that unbal-
anced sets can be formed.

produced by the classifier are used to expand the initial seeds
lists.

rameters.

<bodyText confidence="0.995229147058823">
Hybrid Expansion: Choosing synsets from
WordNet with highest probability assigned by a
classifier learned on the glosses of initial seeds
lists can lead to the well-known semantic shift
problem. So, the idea of the hybrid expansion
is to control the expansion process so that the
most probable time-sensitive synsets are also cho-
sen based on their semantic distance with the ex-
panded seed synsets at the previous iteration. The
process is straightforward when compared to the
probabilistic expansion.
First, a two-class (temporal vs. atemporal) text
classifier is trained based on the glosses of each
synsets contained in the initial seed lists to clas-
sify all the synsets of WordNet. Thereafter, Word-
Net synsets with highest probability are selected as
candidates for expansion. From these candidates,
only the ones that present the maximum seman-
tic similarity to the previous seeds lists are cho-
sen for expansion. Note that the semantic simi-
larity is calculated between the candidate synset
and all synsets in the previous expanded seeds
lists. Once candidates for expansion have been
chosen, a 10-fold cross validation process is itera-
tively performed until accuracy becomes steady.
Second, a three-class (past, present and fu-
ture) classifier is learned over the temporal part of
WordNet with the hybrid expansion process in the
same exact manner as explained for the previous
probabilistic expansion. Results for the expansion
process are presented in the Table 3 and Table 4
for the same experimental setups as for the prob-
abilistic expansion and using the (Leacock et al.,
1998) semantic similarity measures.

Evaluation: In order to intrinsically evaluate
the time-tagged WordNets (TempoWordNets), we
first performed an inter-annotation process over
samples of 50 automatically time-tagged Word-
Net synsets. In particular, three different anno-
tators were presented with temporal synsets and
their respective glosses, and had to decide upon
their correct classification (temporal vs. atempo-
ral). The results of the multirater agreement eval-
uation are presented in Table 6. In particular, we
processed the free-marginal multirater kappa val-
ues (Randolph, 2005) and the fixed-marginal mul-
tirater kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) as no
bias is present in the data. Overall figures assess
moderate agreement for the three TempoWord-
Nets: TWnL for the lexico-semantic expansion,
TWnP for the probabilistic expansion and TWnH
for the hybrid expansion.

These results evidence the difficulty of the task
for humans as they do not agree on a great deal of
decisions. This is particularly due to the fact that
the temporal dimension of synsets is judged upon
their glosses and not directly on their inherent con-
cept. For example, “dinosaur” can be classified as
temporal or atemporal as its gloss any of numer-
ous extinct terrestrial reptiles of the Mesozoic era
allows both interpretations.
So, we performed a new experiment based on
those examples where human annotator agreement
was 100%. From this dataset, we performed an
inter-annotator agreement process with four an-
notators (three human annotators plus the classi-
fier). The underlying idea is to understand to what
extent the built TempoWordNets comply with the
“easy” cases. Results are illustrated in Table 7 and
clearly show the enhanced intrinsic quality of the
hybrid expansion strategy with an almost adequate
agreement for the free-marginal n.

5 Sentence Temporal Classification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989884615385">
In order to evaluate TempoWordNets, we pro-
posed to test their capability to enhance the exter-
nal task of sentence temporal classification. For
that purpose, we used the corpus developed by
(Dias et al., 2014), which contains 1455 sen-
tences distributed as follows: 724 for past, 385
for present and 346 for future. Different sentence
representations have been used. First, we pro-
posed to represent each sentence with the classi-
cal vector space model using the tf.idf weighting
scheme for unigrams without stop-words removal
(Uni.+SW). Then, we proposed a semantic vector
space representation where each sentence is aug-
mented with the synonyms of any temporal word
contained in it. In particular, we proposed that
the words were matched directly from the Word-
Net time subtree (Uni.+SW+Wn) or from Tem-
poWordNet (Uni.+SW+TWnL, Uni.+SW+TWnP
and Uni.+SW+TWnH) and weighted with tf.idf.
The results of our experiments are reported in Ta-
ble 5. The results evidence that the WordNet time
subtree does not embody enough time-related in-
formation and the process of automatically time-
tagging WordNet can improve the task of sentence
temporal classification, especially with the proba-
bilistic or the hybrid expansion.

<bodyText confidence="0.993967888888889">
In this paper, we proposed the first steps towards
the automatic construction of temporal ontologies.
In particular, we presented and evaluated different
propagation strategies to time tag WordNet giving
rise to different TempoWordNets. First results are
promising and we deeply believe that such a re-
source can be important for time related applica-
tions both in NLP and IR. All resources can be

The underlying idea is that each synset is augmented with its temporal connotation. For that purpose, temporal classifiers are iteratively learned from an initial set of time-sensitive synsets and different propagation strategies to give rise to different TempoWordNets. 1 Introduction Temporality has recently received increased attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR). Initial works have been proposed in NLP and are exhaustively summarized in (Mani et al., 2005). More recently, the introduction of the TempEval task (Verhagen et al., 2009) in the Semantic Evaluation workshop series has clearly established the importance of time to deal with different NLP tasks. The ultimate aim of research in this area is the automatic identification of temporal expressions (timexes), events and temporal relations within a text in the TimeML format (Pustejovsky et al., 2005). In IR, the time dimension has also received particular attention for the past few years.

More recently, the introduction of the TempEval task (Verhagen et al., 2009) in the Semantic Evaluation workshop series has clearly established the importance of time to deal with different NLP tasks. The ultimate aim of research in this area is the automatic identification of temporal expressions (timexes), events and temporal relations within a text in the TimeML format (Pustejovsky et al., 2005). In IR, the time dimension has also received particular attention for the past few years. According to (Metzger, 2007), time is one of the key five aspects that determine a document credibility besides relevance, accuracy, objectivity and coverage. So, the value of information or its quality is intrinsically time-dependent. As a consequence, a new reasearch field called Temporal Information Retrieval (T-IR) has emerged (Alonso et al., 2011) and deals with all classical IR tasks such as crawling (Kulkarni et al., 2011), indexing (Anand et al., 2012) or ranking (Kanhabua et al., 2011) from the time viewpoint. However, both NLP and IR evidence the lack of temporal lexical resources. For example, automatic tempor</context>

More recently, in TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al., 2013), new systems have been performing at high level of performance for all three tasks such as the rule-based multilingual temporal tagger Heideltime (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2013). In IR, the work of (Baeza-Yates, 2005) defines the foundations of T-IR. Since, research have been tackling several topics such as query understanding (Metzler et al., 2009), temporal snippets generation (Alonso et al., 2007), temporal ranking (Kanhabua et al., 2011), temporal clustering (Alonso et al., 2009), future retrieval (Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013) or temporal image retrieval (Dias et al., 2012). As expressed in (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2013), time taggers usually contain pattern files with words and phrases, which are typically used to express temporal expressions in a given language (e.g. names of months).

However, the list of such expressions is limited. From the IR viewpoint, most methodologies rely on the presence of explicit timexes and hardly bridge the gap when no explicit mention of time is available. One recent exception is proposed in (Jatowt et al., 2013) where text time-tagging is seen as a classification task, but no use of specific temporal clues is introduced or proposed. Inspired by SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), we propose to introduce the temporal connotation of each synset in WordNet (Miller, 1995) by iteratively learning temporal classifiers from an initial set of time-sensitive synsets and a given propagation strategy. As such, each synset is automatically time-tagged with four dimensions i.e. atemporal, past, present and future, thus giving rise to different TempoWordNets depending on the propagation strategy. TempoWordNets are evaluated both manually and automatically. First, results show that manual annotation of time-tagged synsets is a hard task for humans. Second, automatic evaluation based on sentence temporal classification shows that the introduction of time-augmented lexical</context>

However, likewise the tennis problem evidenced in (Fellbaum, 1998), most temporal words are not under the concept of time. For example, concepts such as “prediction”, “remember”, “ancient” or “fresh” clearly have a time dimension although they are not listed under the time subtree of WordNet. Based on the intial ideas of (Moens and Steedman, 1987) on temporal ontologies and inspired by SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), we propose to enrich all WordNet synsets with their temporal connotation. 3 TempoWordNet as SentiWordNet In (Dias et al., 2014), we first proposed to build TempoWordNet based on the idea of (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) for SentiWordNet.
