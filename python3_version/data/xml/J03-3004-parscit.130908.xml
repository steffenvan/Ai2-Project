We have developed an example-based machine translation (EBMT) system that uses the World
Wide Web for two different purposes: First, we populate the system’s memory with translations
gathered from rule-based MT systems located on the Web. The source strings input to these
systems were extracted automaticallyfrom an extremely small subset of the rule types in the Penn-
II Treebank. In subsequent stages, the (source, target) translation pairs obtained are automatically
transformed into a series of resources that render the translation process more successful. Despite
the fact that the output from on-line MT systems is often faulty, we demonstrate in a number
of experiments that when used to seed the memories of an EBMT system, they can in fact prove
useful in generating translations of high quality in a robust fashion. In addition, we demonstrate
the relative gain of EBMT in comparison to on-line systems. Second, despite the perception that
the documents available on the Web are of questionable quality, we demonstrate in contrast that
such resources are extremely useful in automatically postediting translation candidates proposed
by our system.

In quite a short space of time, translation memory (TM) systems have become a very
useful tool in the translator’s armory. TM systems store a set of (source, target) trans-
lation pairs in their databases. If a new input string cannot be found exactly in the
translation database, a search is conducted for close (or “fuzzy”) matches of the input
string, and these are retrieved together with their translations for the translator to
manipulate into the final, output translation. From this description, it should be clear
that TM systems do not translate: Indeed, some researchers consider them to be little
more than a search-and-replace engine, albeit a rather sophisticated one (Macklovitch
and Russell 2000).
We can illustrate this with respect to the TM entries in (1), taken from the Canadian
Hansards:
(1) a. While most were critical, some contributions were thoughtful and
constructive ==:� La plupart ont formule´ des critiques, mais certains ont
fait des observations r ´efl´echies et constructives.
b. Others were plain meanspirited and some contained errors of fact =�

Despite the fact that this new input in (2) is extremely close to the source strings
in the TM entries in (1), no TM system containing just these translation pairs in its
database would be able to translate (2); the best they could do would be to identify
one or both of the two source sentences in the TM in (1) as fuzzy matches and display
these, together with their French translations. The translator would then manipulate
the target strings in the TM into the final translation (3):

At all stages in the translation process, therefore, the translators themselves are the
integral figures: They are free to accept or reject any suggested matches, they construct
the translations, and they may or may not use any translations proposed by the TM
system to formulate the translations in the target document. Finally, they are free to
insert the translations produced into the TM itself as they see fit: that is, either (3) or
(4) could be inserted into the TM with the source string (2), or some other translation,
if that were preferred.
A prerequisite for TM (and example-based machine translation [EBMT]) applica-
tions is a parallel corpus aligned at sentential level. Such a corpus may be presented
to translators en bloc, or translators may help construct it themselves. Here too the
translator maintains a large degree of autonomy: Using a tool such as Trados WinAlign,
for example, he or she may manually overwrite some of the aligner’s decisions by
linking (source, target) sentence pairs using the graphical interface provided.
Nevertheless, TM systems are currently falling far short of their potential, given
the limitation that the smallest accessible translation units are (source, target) strings
aligned only at sentential level. Consider the fuzzy matching operation, for instance:
Translators are able to set a fuzzy match threshold below which no translation pairs
are proposed by the TM system. If this threshold is set too low, then potentially useful
translation pairs will be presented along with a lot of noise, thereby risking that this
useful translation information will be obscured (high recall, low precision); if it is set
too low, then good matches will be presented, but potentially useful matches will
not be (low recall, high precision). We noted above that faced with the new input in
(2), a TM system might be able to present the translator with the fuzzy matches in
(1). However, if a translator were to set the level of fuzzy matching at 80% (a not
unreasonable level), then neither of the translation pairs in (1) would be deemed to
be a suitably good fuzzy match, as only 7/9 (77%) of the words in (1a) match those
in (2) exactly, and only 3/9 (33%) of the words in (1b) match those in (2) exactly.
Indeed, setting an appropriate fuzzy match level is such a difficult problem that some
translators switch off this option and use the TM only to find exact matches.
If subsentential alignment could be integrated into the TM databases, more useful
fragments could be put at the disposal of the translator. If we could fragment the

sententially aligned TM examples in (1) so that subsentential chunks were displayed
to the user, then the chance of finding exact matches or good fuzzy matches would
increase considerably. This is currently beyond the scope of TM systems.
In contrast, EBMT systems have overcome this constraint by storing subsentential
translational correspondences in addition to the sententially aligned pairs from which
they are derived. As a consequence, where a TM system can only propose a number
of close-scoring matches in its database for the translator to adapt into the final trans-
lation, an EBMT system can produce translations itself by automatically combining
chunks from different translation examples stored in its memories.
In Section 2, we describe how we automatically obtain a hierarchy of lexical re-
sources that are used sequentially by our EBMT system, wEBMT, to translate new
input. The primary resource gathered is a “phrasal lexicon,” constructed by extracting
over 200,000 phrases from the Penn Treebank and having them translated into French
by three Web-based machine translation (MT) systems.
Each set of translations is stored separately, and for each set the “marker hypoth-
esis” (Green 1979) is used to segment the phrasal lexicon into a “marker lexicon.” The
marker hypothesis is a universal psycholinguistic constraint which states that natural
languages are ”marked” for complex syntactic structure at surface form by a closed
set of specific lexemes and morphemes. That is, a basic phrase-level segmentation of
an input sentence can be achieved by exploiting a closed list of known marker words
to signal the start and end of each segment.
Consider the following example, selected at random from the Wall Street Journal
section of the Penn-II Treebank:
(5) The Dearborn, Mich., energy company stopped paying a dividend in the
third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its Midland nuclear plant.
Here we see that three noun phrases start with determiners and one with a possessive
pronoun. The sets of determiners and possessive pronouns are both very small. Fur-
thermore, there are four prepositional phrases, and the set of prepositions is similarly
small. A further assumption that could be made is that all words that end with -ed are
verbs, such as stopped in (5). The marker hypothesis is arguably universal in presum-
ing that concepts and structures like these have similar morphological or structural
marking in all languages.
The marker hypothesis has been used for a number of different language-related
tasks, including

With respect to translation, a potential problem in using the marker hypothesis is that
some languages do not have marker words such as articles, for instance. Green’s (1979)
work showed that artificial languages, both with and without specific marker words,
may be learned more accurately and quickly if such psycholinguistic cues exist. The

research of Mori and Moeser (1983) showed a similar effect due to case marking on
pseudowords in such artificial languages, and Morgan, Meier, and Newport (1989)
demonstrated that languages that do not permit pronouns as substitutes for phrases
also provide evidence in favor of the marker hypothesis. Juola’s (1994, 1998) work
on grammar optimization and induction shows that context-free grammars can be
converted to ”marker-normal form.” However, marker-normal form grammars cannot
capture the sorts of regularities demonstrated for languages that do not have a one-
to-one mapping between a terminal symbol and a word. Nevertheless, Juola (1998,
page 23) observes that “a slightly more general mapping, where two adjacent termi-
nal symbols can be merged into a single lexical item (for example, a word and its
case-marking), can capture this sort of result quite handily.” Work using the marker
hypothesis for MT adapts this monolingual mapping for pairs of languages: It is rea-
sonably straightforward to map an English determiner-noun sequence onto a Japanese
noun–case marker segment, once one has identified the sets of marker tags in the lan-
guages to be translated.
Following construction of the marker lexicon, the (source, target) chunks are gen-
eralized further using a methodology based on Block (2000) to permit a limited form
of insertion in the translation process. As a byproduct of the chosen methodology,
we also derive a standard ”word-level” translation lexicon. These various resources
render the set of original translation pairs far more useful in deriving translations of
previously unseen input.
In Section 3, we describe in detail the segmentation process, together with the
procedure whereby target chunks are combined to produce candidate translations. In
Section 4, we report initially on two experiments in which we test different versions
of our EBMT system against test sets of NPs and sentences. We then conduct a set of
further experiments which show that using the resources developed from more than
one on-line MT system may improve both translation coverage and quality. Further-
more, seeding the system databases with more fragments improves translation quality.
In addition, we calculate the net gain of our EBMT system by comparing translation
quality against that of the three on-line MT systems. Finally, we comment on the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the three on-line MT systems used.
Like most EBMT systems, our approach suffers from the problem of “boundary
friction”: where chunks from different translation examples are recombined, the quality
of the resulting translations may be compromised. Assume that the aligned examples
in (6) are located in the system database:
</bodyText>

Let us now confront the EBMT system with the new input string in (7):

However, a number of mistranslations could also ensue, including those in (10):

to ==&gt; au (from (6a))
the ==&gt; le (from (6b))

It is clear, therefore, that unless the process by which the original (source, target)
sentence pairs are fragmented is well defined and strictly controlled, chunks may
be combined from different contexts that result in agreement errors such as those in
(10).1 Depending on the input string, our wEBMT system may generate thousands
of candidate translations, including many mistranslations like those in (10). A major
advantage of MT systems based on probabilities is that output translations can be
ranked (and pruned, if required): One would hope that such systems would rank
good translations such as that in (9) more highly than poor ones such as those in (10).
We demonstrate that in almost all experiments, our EBMT system consistently ranks
the “best” translation in the top 10 output translations, and always in the top 1% of
the translations generated.
In order to minimize errors of boundary friction, in Section 5 we develop a novel,
post hoc procedure via the World Wide Web to validate and, if necessary, correct
translations prior to their being output to the user.2 Finally we conclude and point to
areas of future research.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.582821533333333">
1 Note also that with respect to the translations given in (3) and (4), the translator interacting with the
TM has used his or her translation knowledge to avoid a problem of boundary friction: Given the TM
entries in (1), the translation of plain meanspirited would appear to be mesquins. This is correct in this
context, as it co-occurs with a masculine plural noun propos. In translating (2), however, observations is a
feminine plural noun, so the adjective mesquines is inserted to maintain agreement throughout the NP.
If the translation pair (plain meanspirited, mesquines) were not found in the system’s memories, then
only the mistranslation observations mesquins could be produced by an EBMT system.
2 One of the areas of boundary friction that we use our post hoc validation procedure to correct is that of
subject-verb agreement. Note that with examples such as (18), this is not usually (such) a problem for
marker-based approaches to MT as we face here, as verbs are contained within (part of) the same
chunk as their subject NPs. However, given that we translate phrases rather than sentences, it is a
considerable problem for our approach, yet one that we overcome satisfactorily. In further work, if we
were to store the translations of the VPs with their dummy subject NPs in a sentential lexicon and
derive all marker lexicons from this database, the problem of subject-verb agreement would be largely
overcome.

2. Deriving Translation Resources from Web-Based MT Systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99909095">
All EBMT systems, from the initial proposal by Nagao (1984) to the recent collection
of Carl and Way (2003), are premised on the availability of subsentential alignments
derived from the input bitext. There is a wealth of literature on trying to establish sub-
sentential translations from a bilingual corpus.3 Kay and R¨oscheisen (1993) attempt to
extract a bilingual dictionary using a hybrid method of sentence and word alignment
on the assumption that the (source, target) words have a similar distribution. Fung
and McKeown (1997) attempt to translate technical terms using word relation matrices,
although the resource from which such relations are derived is a pair of nonparallel
corpora. Somers (1998) replicates the work of Fung and McKeown with different lan-
guage pairs using the simpler metric of Levenshtein distance. Boutsis and Piperidis
(1998) use a tagged parallel corpus to extract translationally equivalent English-Greek
clauses on the basis of word occurrence and co-occurrence probabilities. The respec-
tive lengths of the putative alignments in terms of characters is also an important
factor. Ahrenberg, Andersson, and Merkel (2002) observe that for less widely spoken
languages, the relative lack of linguistic tools and resources has forced developers of
word alignment tools for such languages to use shallow processing and basic statis-
tical approaches to word linking. Accordingly, they generate lexical correspondences
by means of co-occurrence measures and string similarity metrics.
More specifically, the notion of the phrasal lexicon (used first by Becker 1975) has
been used successfully in a number of areas:

<listItem confidence="0.999962">
• Learnability (Zernik and Dyer 1987)

• Localization (Sch¨aler 1996)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999558764705882">
More recently, Simard and Langlais (2001) have proposed the exploitation of TMs at
a subsentential level, while Carl, Way, and Sch¨aler (2002) and Sch¨aler, Way, and Carl
(2003, pages 108–109) describe how phrasal lexicons might come to occupy a central
place in a future hybrid integrated translation environment. This, they suggest, may
result in a paradigm shift from TM to EBMT via the phrasal lexicon: Translators are
on the whole wary of MT technology, but once subsentential alignment is enabled,
translators will become aware of the benefits to be gained from (source, target) phrasal
segments, and from there they suggest that “it is a reasonably short step to enabling
an automated solution via the recombination element of EBMT systems such as those
described in [Carl and Way 2003].”
In this section, we describe how the memory of our EBMT system is seeded with
a set of translations obtained from Web-based MT systems. From this initial resource,
we subsequently derive a number of different databases that together allow many
new input sentences to be translated that it would not be possible to translate in
other systems. First, the phrasal lexicon is segmented using the marker hypothesis to
produce a marker lexicon. This is then generalized, following a methodology based on
Block (2000), to generate the “generalized marker lexicon.” Finally, as a result of the

2.1 The Phrasal Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9962154">
Our phrasal lexicon was built by selecting a set of 218,697 English noun phrases and
verb phrases from the Penn Treebank. We identified all rule types occurring 1,000
or more times and eliminated those that were not relevant (e.g., rules dealing only
with numbers). Where rules contained just a single nonterminal on their right-hand
side, only those rules whose left-hand side was VP were retained in order to ensure
that we could handle intransitive verbs. In total, 59 rule types out of a total of over
29,000 (i.e., just 0.002% of the rules in Penn-II) were used in creating the various lexical
resources. For each of these 59 rule types, the tokens corresponding to the rule right-
hand sides were extracted. These extracted English phrases were then translated using
three on-line MT systems:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999922666666667">
• SDL International’s Enterprise Translation Server4 (system A)
• Reverso by Softissimo5 (system B)
• Logomedia6 (system C)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863">
Translating the NPs via these MT systems was reasonably straightforward. We
report in Section 4 on the quality of the French NPs produced, and in Section 5 we
discuss experiments designed to discover whether our EBMT system could improve
on any mistranslations obtained. Translating the VPs involved a little more thought:
In the main, on-line MT systems such as these work far better when they translate
sentences. In order to obtain finite verb forms rather than the default infinitival forms,
we provided dummy subjects. Initially these were third-person plural pronouns, which
caused similar verb forms to be created. This obviously biases the EBMT system more
in favor of third-person plural sentences. Nevertheless, using the WWW-based post hoc
evaluation methodology proposed in Section 5, we were still able to obtain reasonable
translations for non-third-person-plural sentences too. In a subsequent experiment,
we seed the databases of wEBMT with third-person singular verb forms by providing
third-person singular pronouns as the dummy subjects, and in a final experiment
we combine all third-person fragments (both singular and plural) into the system’s
memories and compare results on the same test set.
The on-line MT systems were selected purely because they enable batch translation
of large quantities of text. In our experience, the most efficient way to translate large
amounts of data via on-line MT systems is to send each document as an HTML page
with the phrases to be translated encoded as an ordered list. We automatically tagged
the English phrases with HTML codes and input them into each translation system
using the Unix wget function, which takes a URL as input and writes the corresponding
HTML document to a file. If the URL takes the form of a query, then the document
retrieved is the result of the query, namely, the translated Web page. Once this is
obtained, it is a simple process to retrieve the French translations and associate them
with their English source equivalents.

2.2 The Marker Lexicons
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977615666666667">
Given that the marker hypothesis is arguably universal, it is clear that benefits may
accrue by using it to facilitate subsentential alignment of (source, target) chunks. Juola
(1994, 1997) conducts some small experiments using his METLA system to show the
viability of this approach for English −&gt; French and English −&gt; Urdu. For the English
−&gt; French language pair, Juola gives results of 61% correct translation when the
system is tested on the training corpus, and 36% accuracy when it is evaluated with
test data. For English −&gt; Urdu, Juola (1997, page 213) notes that “the system learned
the original training corpus ... perfectly and could reproduce it without errors”; that
is, it scored 100% accuracy when tested against the training corpus. On novel test
sentences, he gives results of 72% correct translation. In their Gaijin system, Veale and
Way (1997) give a result of 63% accurate translations obtained for English −&gt; German
on a test set of 791 sentences from CorelDRAW manuals.
As in METLA and Gaijin, we exploit lists of known marker words for each language
to indicate the start and end of segments. For English, our source language, we use
the sets of marker words in (13):
&lt;DET&gt; {the, a, an, those, these, ... }
&lt;PREP&gt; {in, on, out, with, from, to, under, ... }
&lt;QUANT&gt; {all, some, few, many, ... }
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.626870333333333">
&lt;CONJ&gt; {and, or, ... }
&lt;POSS&gt; {my, your, our,... }
&lt;PRON&gt; {I, you, he, she, it,... }
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.963196">
A similar set (14) was produced for French, the target language in our wEBMT system:
&lt;DET&gt; {le, la, l’, les, ce, ces, ceux, cet, ... }
&lt;PREP&gt; {dans, sur, avec, de, `a, sous, ... }
&lt;QUANT&gt; {tous, tout, toutes, certain, quelques, beaucoup, ... }
&lt;CONJ&gt; {et, ou, ... }
&lt;POSS&gt; {mon, ma, mes, ton, ta, tes, notre, nos, ... }
&lt;PRON&gt; {je, j’, tu, il, elle, ... }
In a preprocessing stage, the aligned (source, target) pairs in the phrasal lexicon are
traversed word by word, and whenever any such marker word is encountered, a new
chunk is begun, with the first word labeled with its marker category (&lt;DET&gt;, &lt;PREP&gt;,
etc.). The example in (15) illustrates the results of running the marker hypothesis over
the source phrase all uses of asbestos:

In addition, we impose a further constraint that each chunk must also contain at least
one non–marker word, so that the phrase out in the cold will be viewed as one segment
(labeled with &lt;PREP&gt;), rather than split into still smaller chunks.
For each (English, FrenchX) pair, where X is one of the sets of translations derived
from the three separate MT on-line systems (see above), we derive separate marker
lexicons for each of the 218,697 source phrases and target translations. This gives

course). Given that English and French have essentially the same word order, these

Sometimes the number of marker chunks in the two languages differs, with respect to
both the marker categories and the number of chunks obtained. Consider the example
in (17):
(17) The man looks at the woman =⇒ L’homme regarde la femme.
Once the marker hypothesis is applied to (17), it would be marked up as in (18):
(18) &lt;DET&gt; The man looks &lt;PREP&gt; at &lt;DET&gt; the woman =⇒
&lt;DET&gt; L’ homme regarde &lt;DET&gt; la femme.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999356571428571">
That is, the English verb subcategorizes for a PP complement which in this case con-
tains two marker words, whereas the French verb regarder is a straightforward tran-
sitive verb. It may appear, therefore, that there are three chunks in the English string
and only two on the French side, but this is not the case: The restriction that each
segment must contain at least one non–marker word ensures that we have just two
marker chunks for the English string in (18). However, it remains the case that the
chunks are tagged differently; we obtain the marker chunks in (19):

<listItem confidence="0.775991166666667">
(19) English:
&lt;DET&gt; The man looks
&lt;PREP&gt; at &lt;DET&gt; the woman
French:
&lt;DET&gt; L’ homme regarde
&lt;DET&gt; la femme
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999354333333333">
Our alignment method would therefore align the first English chunk with the first
French chunk, as their marker categories match. Note, of course, that this contains a
translation error: regarde translates not as looks but rather as looks at. Errors such as this
will adversely affect translation quality, but as we report in Section 4, good-quality
translations are obtainable on the whole. The second pair in (19), however, cannot
be mapped straightforwardly onto one another, as the marker categories differ. Nev-
ertheless, our algorithm would align “&lt;DET&gt; the woman” with “&lt;DET&gt; la femme,” as
their marker categories match. This ensures that as many potentially useful translation
fragments are generated as possible.
This naive alignment procedure works well between (broadly) similar languages
such as English and French, but there are cases even between quite closely related
languages in which the procedure breaks down. In order to increase translation quality

still further, the mapping function needs to be improved to account for examples such
as (20):
(20) The man likes the woman ==:&gt; La femme plait a` l’homme.
The like ==:&gt; plaire case is an argument-switching (or relation-changing) example, in
that the subject in English becomes the indirect object in French, and the English object
translates as the French subject. If we were to apply the marker hypothesis to (20), we
would derive (21):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.951013833333333">
(21) &lt;DET&gt; The man likes &lt;DET&gt; the woman ==:&gt;
&lt;DET&gt; La femme plait &lt;PREP&gt; a` &lt;DET&gt; l’ homme.
That is, without recourse to a lexicon or information about the relative distribution of
words and their translations, we would derive the marker chunks in (22):
(22) a. &lt;DET&gt; The man likes ==:&gt; &lt;DET&gt; La femme plait
b. &lt;DET&gt; the woman ==:&gt; &lt;DET&gt; l’ homme
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986865">
Of course, both alignments are wrong. However, our alignment method correctly aligns
(source, target) segments in approximately 80% of cases. We calculate this as an ap-
proximation by testing all translations of marker chunks to see whether these French
chunks appear anywhere on the Web: If so, we assume that the translations obtained
by the online MT systems are correct. For 39,895 such translations, 75.2% of those
produced by system A appear on the Web, with 81.7% of those generated by system
B and 81.5% of those produced by system C also appearing on the Web. Note that
this gives us only an approximation of the correctness of our alignments, as we are
testing whether the French translations are “good French” rather than whether the
alignments in which they appear are actually correct.
Correcting misalignments such as those in (22) is a topic for further research.
Adding a bilingual lexicon (our word-level lexicon, for example) and incorporating the
constraints contained therein into the marker-based alignment process would prevent
chunks such as those in (22) from being generated, and we conjecture that translation
quality would improve accordingly.
Given marker chunks such as those in (16), we are able to extract automatically a
further bilingual dictionary, the word-level lexicon. We take advantage of the assump-
tion that where a chunk contains just one non–marker word in both source and target,
these words are translations of each other. Where a marker-headed pair contains just
two words, as in (16), for instance, we can extract the word-level translations in (23):

Juola (1994, 1997) assumes that words ending in -ed are verbs. However, given
that verbs are not a closed class, in our approach we do not mark chunks beginning
with a verb with any marker category. Instead, we take advantage of the fact that the
initial phrasal chunks correspond to rule right-hand sides. That is, for a rule in the
Penn Treebank VP −&gt; VBG, NP, PP, we are certain (if the annotators have done their
job correctly) that the first word in each of the strings corresponding to this right-hand
side is a VBG, that is, a present participle. Given this information, in such cases we tag
such words with the &lt;LEX&gt; tag. Taking expanding the board to 14 members −&gt; augmente
le conseil a` 14 membres as an example, we extract the chunks in (24):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.784645375">

&lt;DET&gt; the : le

<bodyText confidence="0.999829142857143">
We ignore here the trivially true lexical chunk “&lt;QUANT&gt; 14 : 14.”
In a final processing stage, we generalize over the marker lexicon following a
process found in Block (2000). In Block’s approach, word alignments are assigned
probabilities by means of a statistical word alignment tool. In a subsequent stage,
chunk pairs are extracted, which are then generalized to produce a set of translation
templates for each (source, target) segment.
Block distinguishes chunks from “patterns,” as we do: His chunks are similar to
our marker chunks, and his patterns are similar to our generalized marker chunks.
Once chunks are derived from (source, target) alignments, patterns are computed from
the derived chunks by means of the following algorithm: “for each pair of chunk pairs
((CS1,CT1),(CS2, CT2)), if CS1 is a substring in CS2 and CT1 is a substring in CT2, then
(PS, PT) is a pattern pair where PS equals CS2 with CS1 replaced by a variable V and
PT equals CT2 with CT1 replaced by V” (Block 2000, pages 414–415). Block then gives
an example that shows how patterns are derived. Assume the chunk pairs in (25):

( [das V], [which V] )

Of course, many other researchers also try to extract generalized templates. Kaji,
Kida, and Morimoto (1992) identify translationally equivalent phrasal segments and
replace such equivalents with variables to generate a set of translation patterns. Watan-
abe (1993) combines lexical and dependency mappings to form his generalizations.
Other similar approaches include those of Cicekli and G¨uvenir (1996), McTait and
Trujillo (1999), Carl (1999), and Brown (2000), inter alia.
In our system, in some cases the smallest chunk obtainable via the marker-based
segmentation process may be something like (27):
(27) &lt;DET&gt; the good man: le bon homme
In such cases, if our system were confronted with a good man, it would not be able
to translate such a phrase, assuming this to be missing from the marker lexicon. Ac-
cordingly, we convert examples such as (27) into their generalized equivalents, as in
(28):
(28) &lt;DET&gt; good man: bon homme
That is, where Block (2000) substitutes variables for various words in his templates,
we replace certain lexical items with their marker tag. Given that examples such as
’‘&lt;DET&gt; a : un” are likely to exist in the word-level lexicon, they may be inserted at
the point indicated by the marker tag to form the correct translation un bon homme. We
thus cluster on marker words to improve the coverage of our system (see Section 5
for results that show exactly how clustering on marker words helps); others (notably
Brown [2000, 2003]) use clustering techniques to determine equivalence classes of
individual words that can occur in the same context, and in so doing derive translation
templates from individual translation examples.

our test set is translated via these different knowledge sources:

<bodyText confidence="0.96258775">
Given the fragments shown in (29), a translation can now be derived. First, the
word pair “&lt;DET&gt; a : une” is inserted into the generalized template “&lt;DET&gt; major
concern: inqui´etude majeure” to begin the translation process; the next chunk, “for
the parent company : pour la soci´et´e m`ere,” is retrieved from the marker lexicon; the
missing word pair “&lt;LEX&gt; is : est” is retrieved from the word-level lexicon; and finally,
the marker chunk “what advertisers are paying per page : quels annonceurs paient
per page” is appended to produce the translation in (30):
(30) Une inqui´etude majeure pour la soci´et´e m`ere est quels annonceurs
paient per page.
Of course, this “translation” is not without problems: There is a poor (in this instance)
translation of what as quels, and a nontranslation of per. There is little our system can
do about errors such as these made by the on-line MT systems. Nevertheless, (29)
illustrates how the various knowledge sources play a part in determining the final
translation in our system.
Note that none of these aligned resources would be possible in a TM system. The
problem of segmentation is not an inconsiderable one in all EBMT systems, but we
(and others) have found that using the marker hypothesis can greatly facilitate such a
process. We shall show in subsequent sections that because such knowledge sources
are derived automatically from the original translations obtained via Web-based MT
systems, the translations obtained in our EBMT process are largely of high quality, are
ranked highly in the set of output translation candidates, and may be generated in
almost all cases—all this despite the fact that the original translations obtained via the
Web contain many errors, and that the source phrases to be translated were selected
from a mere fraction of the rule types in the Penn-II Treebank.

translate NPs for two reasons: (1) to assure ourselves that we are in fact translating
nominal chunks correctly, and (2) to see whether our methodology can actually correct
any NPs mistranslated by the three on-line MT systems. In this section, we describe
the processes involved in retrieving appropriate chunks and forming translations for
NPs only (these being fewer in number than for sentences, of course).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99996">
3.1 Segmentation of the Input
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9971245">
In many cases, a 100% match for a given NP cannot be found in the phrasal lexicon.
In order to try and process the NP in a compositional manner, it is segmented into
smaller chunks, and the system then attempts to locate these chunks individually and
to retrieve their relevant translation(s) from the various lexicons described above. We
use an n-gram-based segmentation method. Initially, we located all possible bigrams,
trigrams and so on within the input string and then searched for these within the
relevant knowledge sources.
However, many of these n-grams cannot be found by our system, given that new
chunks are placed in the marker lexicon when a marker word is found in a sentence.
Taking the NP the total at risk a year as an example, chunks such as the total at risk a
or at risk a cannot be located, as new chunks would be formed at each marker word
(assuming the adjacent word is a non–marker word), so the best that could be expected
here might be to find the chunks in (31):
(31) &lt;DET&gt; the total, &lt;PREP&gt; at risk, &lt;DET&gt; a year
The respective translations of these chunks would then be recombined to form the
target string. In a recent addition to our work, we have eliminated certain n-grams
(such as those that end in a marker word, for instance) from the search process, as
these would never be found given our chosen method of segmentation.

We use translations retrieved from the three different on-line MT systems specified

chunks produced by each system. These knowledge sources can be combined in several
different ways. We have produced translations using

3.3 Calculation of Weights
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999234666666667">
Each time a source language (SL) chunk is submitted for translation, the appropriate
target language (TL) chunks are retrieved and returned with a weight attached. We
use a maximum of six knowledge sources:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8692563">
• Stage 1: Three sets of translations (A, B, and C) are retrieved using each
of the three on-line MT systems.
• Stage 2: Three sets of translations (A&apos;, B&apos;, and C&apos;) acquired by breaking
down the translations retrieved in Stage 1 using the marker hypothesis
to form the marker lexicon, the generalized marker lexicon, and the
word-level lexicon.
Within each knowledge source, each translation is weighted according to the formula
in (32):
(32) weight = number of occurrences of the proposed translation
total number of translations produced for SL phrase
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999742619047619">
For the SL phrase the house, assuming that la maison is found eight times and le
domicile is found twice, then P(la maison  |the house) = 8/10 and P(le domicile  |the
house) = 2/10. Note that since each SL phrase will only have one proposed translation
within each of the knowledge sources acquired at Stage 1, these translations will
always have a weight of 1.
If we wish to consider only those translations produced using a single MT system
(e.g., A and A&apos;), we add the weights of translations found in both knowledge sources
and divide the weights of all proposed translations by two. For the SL phrase the
house, assuming P(la maison  |the house) = 5/10 in knowledge source A and P(la
maison  |the house) = 8/10 in A&apos;, then P(la maison  |the house) = 13/20 over both
knowledge sources. Similarly, if we wish to consider translations produced by all three
MT systems, then we add the weights of common translations and divide the weights
of all proposed translations by six.
When translated phrases have been retrieved for each chunk of the input string,
they must then be combined to produce an output string. In order to calculate a
ranking for each TL sentence produced, we multiply the weights of each chunk used
in its construction. Note that this ensures that greater importance is attributed to longer
chunks, as is usual in most EBMT systems (cf. Sato and Nagao 1990; Veale and Way
1997; Carl 1999).7
As an example, consider the translation into French of the house collapsed. Assume
the conditional probabilities in (33):

7 Note that approaches that prefer the greatest context to be taken into account are not limited to EBMT.
Research in the area of data-oriented parsing (cf. Bod, Scha, and Sima’an, 2003) also shows that unless
the corpus is inherently biased, derivations constructed using the smallest number of subtrees have a
higher probability than those built with a larger number of smaller subtrees.

highly regarded than those constructed by inserting words from the word-level lexicon
into generalized marker chunks. That is, we want to allocate a larger portion of the
probability space to the phrasal and marker lexicons than to the generalized or word-
level lexicons. We have yet to import such a constraint into our model, but we plan
to do so in the near future using the weighted majority algorithm (Littlestone and

This scale is used to measure the impact on translation quality, both for sentences
and NPs, of using multiple knowledge sources. Although we are primarily interested
in the translation of sentences, we use the NP test set to see whether we are in fact
translating nominal chunks correctly, and also to investigate whether our methodology
can actually correct any NPs mistranslated by the three on-line MT systems. We discuss
this further in Section 5.
We also measure the ability of our system to rank the “best” translation (as deter-
mined by our human experts) highly in the set of output translations. Statistical MT
systems such as wEBMT may derive many different translations for a particular input,
each of which is output with a confidence weighting. We are keen to ensure that if
our system is able to produce high-quality translations, these are ranked as highly
as possible: We do not consider it feasible for a human to have to sift through many
hundreds or thousands of translations in order to determine the “correct” one.
In a further experiment, we translate the test set of sentences via the three on-
line MT systems and test to see whether our system wEBMT can improve on these
translations. In so doing we calculate the “net gain” of performing example-based MT
compared to using on-line MT systems.
Finally, we offer some thoughts on the relative merits of the three on-line MT
systems used in our research. Although this was not the primary focus of our research,
it turned out that we were able, as a direct consequence of our methodology, to evaluate
the on-line MT systems chosen.

4.1 Experiments Using Single Knowledge Sources

Here we report on experiments in which the two test sets are tackled by our system
when its memory is seeded with translations obtained by the individual on-line MT
systems specified in Section 2.1. A parameter that is altered in the experiment on
the sentential test set is the nature of the dummy subjects used to gather the initial
translation fragments: third-person singular, third-person plural, and both third-person
singular and third-person plural.
4.1.1 Sentences. The test set comprised 200 sentences, with an average sentence length
of 8.5 words (minimum 3 words, maximum 18). The input strings were segmented by
applying the n-gram segmentation approach outlined in Section 3.

<bodyText confidence="0.999788666666667">
As far as coverage is concerned, our system wEBMT translated 184 (92%) of the sen-
tences using chunks derived from Systems A and C, and using chunks from system B,
our system managed to translate 180 sentences (90%). The same 16 sentences were not
translated by any of the systems owing to their failure to locate one or more words in
the sentence within the word-level lexicon. Recall that despite the fact that all words
in the test set were seen by the system in the training phase, only those content (i.e.,
non-marker) words that occur in bigram marker chunks are inserted into the word-
level lexicon (cf. (23)). In cases such as these, in which one or more words cannot be
translated by our system, partial translations such as those in (40) are output:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8541744">
(40) A little girl misplaced a full page =⇒ Une petite fille misplaced une
pleine page.
That is, although misplaced was present in the system’s database, it was not present in
the correct context. That is, it appeared in the phrasal lexicon, as shown in (41):
(41) were misplaced =⇒ ont ´ete´ ´egar ´es
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825259259259">
The form required in (40) is a simple past-tense verb, but misplaced appears in (41) only
as a passive participle. The word were in (41) is not a marker word, so this fragment
cannot be broken down any further by our segmentation method.8 In such cases we
output the partial translation with source equivalents for any untranslated words, as
shown in (40).
Ninety-six (48%) of the sentences were translated by combining fragments con-
tained in the original phrasal lexicon or the marker lexicon, 56 (28%) of the translations
were obtained by locating single content (i.e., non-marker) words in the word-level
lexicon and inserting these into the translation at the appropriate position, and 32
(16%) were produced by inserting marker words into generalized templates.
Table 1 shows the results obtained from our human evaluators’ ratings of the
translations produced by our system when it was populated with fragments derived
from one of the individual on-line MT systems. Evaluators rated more than one-third
of translations as intelligible and without syntactic errors (score 3), with over 85% of
translations deemed intelligible (scores 2 and 3) for all systems. Unintelligble transla-
tions (score 1) ranged from 14% for chunks derived from SDL to just 4.4% for trans-
lations formed from knowledge sources created from Logomedia. These initial results
provide some evidence in favor of the hypothesis that Logomedia might be the best
system. Although such evaluation is not a primary focus of our work at the outset,
our methodology provides as a spin-off an evaluation of the three MT systems. We
discuss this further in Section 4.5.
When the system cannot produce a translation for a particular input, the main
reason is an absent word in the word-level lexicon. Adding more lexical entries would
improve translation coverage and would also affect translation quality (possibly ad-
versely, in some cases). We plan to measure the impact of a larger lexicon in future
work. Low-quality translations are almost invariably caused by inappropriate verb
forms in the word-level dictionary: For the experiments carried out in which all verbs

were third-person plural, any NP with a third-person singular subject in the test set
would be accompanied by a third-person plural verb in the translation. A similar effect
is seen where the databases of wEBMT were seeded with third-person singular verbs,
of course. However, we should expect an improvement in translation quality when
both sets of verb forms are included in the memories of the system (see Experiment
2).
Table 2 shows where the “best” translation, as defined by a human expert, was
ranked among the of translations output by our system. In over 65% of cases, the
system itself had ranked the “best” translation first, and the “best” translation was
never located outside the top five ranked translations. This is remarkable given that
over 2,000 translations are output for certain source sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.996777214285714">
The results for the previous experiment were obtained when the databases were seeded
with third-person plural dummy subjects. We ran two variations on this experiment:
(1) we tested the system by seeding its memories with third-person singular dummy
subjects, and (2) We tested the system by seeding its memories with both third-person
singular and third-person plural dummy subjects.
Figure 1 shows that translation quality improves when the system databases are
seeded with more translation pairs. We can see that the system does slightly better
when it uses third-person plural chunks compared to when it uses their singular coun-
terparts. When third-person singular dummy subjects are inserted in order to derive
the initial translation fragments inserted into our system’s memories, the number of
translations rated 3 for quality deteriorates by about 5% for systems B and C and by
about 3% for system A. Given a larger number of third-person plural NP subjects in
our test set, this was to be expected.

produced from chunks derived from system A are rated 3 in 66.1% of cases, and this
rises to 67.9% for system B and 68% for system C. Regarding intelligibility (scores 2
and 3 for quality), system A scores 85.8%, system B scores 91.1%, and system C scores
95.6%. We consider these to be very reasonable results.
Table 3 summarizes the relative ranking of the “best” translation when more trans-
lation pairs are used to seed the system’s memories. Now that both third-person sin-
gular and third-person plural dummy subjects are provided, we see that the number
of “best” translations ranked first deteriorates, by about 6% for systems A and C and
by 4.5% for system B. In Table 2, we saw that the “best” translation was in no case
ranked lower than fifth, but now that many more translations are output per test set
sentence, we sometimes have to search as low as 20th in order to find the “best”
translation.

it is highly probable that they do not exist en bloc in the phrasal lexicon and therefore
need to be analyzed using smaller fragments in the system’s databases.
We give results for coverage and translation quality in Table 4. These results are
for NPs translated via chunks derived from the three individual on-line MT systems.
As with the sentence test set, fragments derived from systems A and C achieve the
broadest coverage, producing translations for 474 out of the 500 NPs; those obtained
from system B enable 463 of the 500 NPs to be translated.
As for quality, wEBMT clearly performs best when using translation fragments
derived from system C: 47.3% of these translations were awarded a quality score of 3,
more than 10% better than for chunks derived from system B. For system C, a total of
452 (96%) of the generated translations were deemed intelligible (scores 2 and 3), that
is, 31 (6.6%) more translations than with system B.
On average, about 54% of translations are formed by combining chunks from
the phrasal lexicon with those from the marker lexicon, about 9% are produced by
inserting marker words into the generalized templates, and about 37% are generated
by inserting single non–marker words from the word-level lexicon at the appropriate
locations in phrasal chunks. The major reason that translations fail to be produced in
6% of cases is the absence of a relevant generalized template. For example, the unseen
input her negative TV ads is generalized to (42):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.56349775">
(42) &lt;POSS&gt; negative TV ads
However, the nearest relevant generalized template found in the system’s memory is
(43):
(43) &lt;DET&gt; negative TV ads
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999521">
That is, the template in (43) allows the insertion of any determiner, but no other
marker word. Deriving translation fragments from more examples would lead to an
improvement in coverage. Alternatively, for marker words that appear in the same
relative position, such as determiners and possessive pronouns, we could “back off”
to a more general marker tag to allow mutual substitution of such words in a subse-
quent operation to enable translation of examples like these. This remains an area of
investigation in future work.
The results in Table 4 further substantiate our findings on the sentence test set,
namely, that system C may be the best of the three on-line MT systems used to populate
the memories of our EBMT system. We comment further on this in Section 4.5. In
addition, these figures provide strong evidence that our system can indeed translate
most noun phrases with which it is confronted and with more than reasonable quality.

If the three on-line MT systems translate the phrases extracted from the Penn-II Tree-
bank in different ways, then combining systems to obtain results for AB, AC, BC,
and ABC always involves an increase in the number of translations produced, both
for sentences and noun phrases. That is, if an input string receives a translation via
chunks derived from the individual on-line systems, when chunks are combined from
different systems, more translations will be output for that input string.
As an example, the number of translations produced by each system for the NP
a plan for reducing debt over 20 years is shown in Table 6. Whereas the greatest num-
ber of translations for this NP produced from chunks from any individual on-line
system is 14, when translation fragments from all three systems are merged (ABC),
224 translations are produced. Combining systems in this way means that all possible
combinations of chunks from the systems are produced: That is, the number of trans-
lations generated via AB is much larger than those derived from either A or B, as now
chunks from A and B may be combined to produce new translations that could not
be generated from the individual knowledge sources. As a further example, consider
the translation of the NP the total at risk a year. When fragments from systems A and
B are combined, the “best” translation is comprised of the chunk combination AAB,
that is, the three-chunk combination in (44), with the first two chunks obtained from
system A, and the last from system B:

A or B, the only possibilities are AAA or BBB, respectively.
However, the number of translations produced by the system is less significant
than their quality. The ranking process outlined in Section 3 classifies the translations
produced with regard to their position as the “best” translation. In the sections below,
we also discuss the issue of quality and show that it improves when more translation
fragments are taken into account. Furthermore, we show below that despite generating
more translations per input string, wEBMT still ranks the “best” translation in the top
1% of all output translation candidates.

Systems. We saw in Experiment 1 that 16 strings in the test set were left untranslated
by systems A, B, and C individually. When knowledge sources are combined, these 16
strings remain untranslated. However, as Figure 2 shows, the translation quality im-
proves significantly. The best individual system performance was 36.5% scoring 3. This
rises to a best performance of 48.9% among pairs of systems combined and improves
still further to 50% when chunks from all three knowledge sources are combined.
Table 7 provides results regarding the relative location of the “best” translation for
sentences. For all system combinations, the “best” translation is to be found among
the top 10 ranked translations in all permutations of combinations of chunks, with
at least 54% ranked first. Despite a corresponding rise in the number of translations
produced per input sentence when all three knowledge sources are combined (ABC),
in over 97% of cases, the “best” translation continues to be found in the top five output
candidates.

ments in translation quality are achieved when the memory of wEBMT is seeded with
both third-person singular and third-person plural fragments. For the pairwise com-
binations, 78.7% of the translations derived from AB are rated 3 for quality, compared
to 80.4% of those derived from AC and BC. The results for ABC improve again, to
81.5%. Regarding intelligibility (scores 2 and 3 for quality), we can see from Figure 2
that near perfect results are obtained: AB scores 95.6%, and all other combinations
score 96.7%.
Table 8 shows the ranking of the “best” translation when multiple knowledge
sources are employed and both third-person singular and third-person plural dummy
subjects are used to populate the system’s memories. The number of instances in which
the “best” translation is ranked first by wEBMT deteriorates: by 24% for AB, by 15% for
AC, by 20% for BC, and by 27% for ABC. For all system combinations, Table 7 shows
that the “best” translation was ranked no lower than 10th; for the system combinations
in Table 8, sometimes the “correct” translation is ranked as low as 36th. As expected,
the worst ranking results are for system combination ABC, in which all system chunks
are combined for both third-person singular and third-person plural dummy subjects.
However, even here the “best” translation is ranked in the top five in over 63% of
cases, and 72.6% of the time it is located among the top 10 ranked translations. For
this system configuration, the lowest we have to look to find the “best” translation
is 36th. For that particular sentence (i.e., the one for which the “best” translation is
ranked 36), over 4,000 possible translations are generated, so even here the “best”
translation remains in the top 1% of translation candidates.

As we did with sentences, we seeded our EBMT system with fragments derived from
the three different on-line MT systems and confronted it with the NP test set. Table 9
clearly shows that as more knowledge sources are added, translation quality improves
considerably. The worst-performing individual system scores 3 for quality in just over
a third of cases, but when all system chunks are combined, this rises to 77.8%. Note
also that, unlike with sentences, we see an increase in coverage when more knowledge
sources are used, from a low of 92.6% for system B to a high of 96% when all chunks
are combined. Many more improvements are seen when our post hoc validation and
correction methodology, described in Section 5, is used, but the merging of fragments
derived from different on-line systems also leads to an improvement in translation
quality. Consider the examples in (45):
(45) Input: an old story in common
System B: une vieille histoire dans commun
System Combination BC: une vieille histoire en commun
That is, the optional PP in common was mistranslated by system B as dans commun, but
when knowledge from system C is added to that of system B, the improved translation
en commun is generated.
We saw in Section 4.1.2 that when translating the NP test set, the “best” transla-
tion, as adjudged by our human evaluators, was to be found no lower than tenth of
all translations output by our system. When knowledge sources are combined, it is

important to measure whether the “best” translation is still highly ranked. The results
of such an assessment are summarized in Table 10. When the “best” translation is
ranked first by the system, we see that the optimal combination of knowledge sources
is the pair BC, with 66.4%. This is an interesting result given that in Table 5, only 57.7%
of the NPs translated by system B were ranked first, with 60% of those produced by
system C ranked in first place. That is, we see a 6.4% improvement (31 NPs) when
fragments from systems B and C are combined. All other combinations cause the num-
ber of “best” translations ranked first to deteriorate, as may be expected. When the
“best” translation is ranked either first or second by the system, the best combination
of fragments is that from system ABC, with 79.5% (376 NPs).
Importantly, for all combinations, the “best” translation remains among the top 10
ranked translations. This is encouraging, as any translator using our system needs only
to examine a small subset of the translations produced to find the “best” one. Indeed,
given the various results shown, we are confident that we could prune the number of
translations generated for presentation to the translator for selection of the “best” one:
For the most part, this is the top ten translations for both NPs and sentences, but in
the worst case, we need present no more than the top 1% of the candidate translations.

4.3 Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989">
The results presented in this section show that seeding the wEBMT system’s databases
with more fragments improves both coverage and translation quality. We do this addi-
tional seeding in two ways: (1) by combining fragments derived from different on-line
MT systems, and (2) by obtaining translations using both third-person singular and
third-person plural dummy subjects. The best combination of these parameters is to
use chunks derived from Logomedia with third-person plural dummy subjects pro-
vided. Nevertheless, despite the fact that Logomedia appears to be the best on-line MT
system, adding chunks from the other two on-line MT systems improves coverage
and translation quality. In sum, therefore, the best results are obtained when chunks
from all three on-line systems (combination ABC) are used and the wEBMT system’s
databases are seeded with translations from these systems for both third-person sin-
gular and third-person plural versions of sentences.
The disadvantage of using more knowledge sources, of course, is that many more
candidate translations are generated, which sometimes causes the “best” translation
to appear lower in the ranked order of output translations. Nevertheless, the “best”
translation is almost always to be found in the top 10 translations produced by wEBMT
and always in the top 1% of the candidate translations.

4.4 Relative Gain of EBMT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995116692307692">
In order to try to calculate the relative gain of EBMT, we translated all 200 strings in the
sentence test set via the three on-line MT systems used elsewhere in our experiments.
Of course, the main advantage of using such Web-based systems is that they are
extremely robust: no matter what they are confronted with, they will always produce
some translation. With respect to coverage, therefore, the on-line systems currently
win out over wEBMT: the size of the lexicons available to the on-line systems means
that they will generate translations with all source words translated more often than
our system will. Nevertheless, the fact that our system outputs partial translations in
situations in which it encounters a word that it cannot translate demonstrates a certain
level of robustness in our system.
Where quality is concerned, however, wEBMT can improve on the translations
produced by the three on-line MT systems. We provided our human evaluators with
the source sentences from the test set, together with the translation generated by our

wEBMT system using combinations of chunks derived from all three on-line systems
(ABC), and the translation obtained directly from the on-line systems themselves. The
pairs of translations (wEBMT and on-line MT system) were presented in a random
order. The evaluators were simply asked to state, for all three on-line MT systems,
which of the pair of translations they preferred: that from the on-line MT system or
that from wEBMT.
Translations produced by wEBMT using chunks derived from all three systems
were preferred to those from system A in 30/184 cases (16.3%) (we ignored the 16
cases for which our system could produce only partial translations); for system B,
our system’s translations were preferred in 8/180 cases (4.4%); and for system C,
our system was judged as producing better translations in 6/184 cases (3.3%). Some
examples in which our system offered improvements over the translations provided
by the on-line MT systems are shown in (46):

Regarding the first two translation pairs in (46), wEBMT has provided a finite verb
where the on-line MT systems have none. In addition, the translation of the subject
NPs is much improved. As for the final translation pair in (46), whereas Logomedia
managed to retrieve the correct translation of provide, this was not the main verb in
the English input string. wEBMT, on the other hand, does translate hire correctly as a
verb rather than a noun.
We consider three ways in which the net gain of EBMT may be calculated. First,
we assume it is equal to the number of translations produced by wEBMT that are
preferred by the human evaluator, minus those derived by the on-line MT systems
that are preferred, divided by the total number of translations. In fact, where both
wEBMT and the on-line systems produce a translation, those derived via wEBMT are
always preferred. Those translations produced by the on-line systems that are preferred
are those in which wEBMT was unable to generate a complete translation. This is quite
a harsh measure: As can be seen from the translations in (46), although the words in
the translations produced by the on-line systems are all French (but recall (29)–(30),
in which this was not the case), the translations themselves are poor. In some cases,
despite the fact that the translations derived via wEBMT may contain an untranslated
English word, the accompanying partial translations may in fact be deemed superior
to the “complete” translations derived via the on-line systems.
Nevertheless, assuming that the on-line systems win out in these situations, the
net gain compared to system A is 14/200 (7%), whereas for systems B and C, we see
in effect a net loss: −12/200 (−6%) for system B, and −10/200 (−5%) for system C. If
we can obtain complete translations in those cases in which we currently encounter

an untranslatable word, we are confident that we can convert these net losses into
net gains. With respect to system A, we can assume that our net gain would increase
further.
However, we provide two other interpretations of the net gain of EBMT, calculated
using the formula in (47):
(47) Net Gain = Coverage Percentage + K(Translation Quality)
The term Translation Quality in (47) refers to the number of translations preferred by
the human evaluator, excluding cases in which one system failed to produce a trans-
lation, which is already factored into the equation under the term Coverage Percentage.
Where K=1, we view coverage and translation quality as equally important. If we
consider quality to be more important, we can increase K. We provide results for K=1
and K=2 in (48):
(48) Where K=1:
Net GainMT = 100
Net GainEBMT = 92 + 30 = 122 (compared to system A)
Net GainEBMT = 92 + 8 = 100 (compared to system B)
Net GainEBMT = 92 + 6 = 98 (compared to system C)
Where K=2:
Net GainMT = 100
Net GainEBMT = 92 + 60 = 152 (compared to system A)
Net GainEBMT = 92 + 16 = 108 (compared to system B)
Net GainEBMT = 92 + 12 = 104 (compared to system C)
That is, where K=1, wEBMT outperforms SDL by a factor of 22, whereas there is no gain
with respect to Reverso, and a slight loss compared to Logomedia. However, wEBMT
outperforms all three on-line systems when translation quality is viewed as twice as
important as coverage. This is a reasonable view, we feel, and our system shows a net
gain against all three on-line systems in this context. Although the coverage obtained
with the on-line systems is better, the improved translation quality obtained with
wEBMT ensures a net gain.
We expect to obtain more insightful results regarding the relative gain of EBMT
over on-line MT systems when automatic evaluation metrics (such as IBM’s Bleu, or
dynamic programming, or sentence- and word-error rates) have been obtained. This
is a priority in future work.

4.5 Evaluating Individual On-line MT Systems

The previous sections detail the results obtained when translation fragments derived
from the three individual on-line MT systems are used, together with various combi-
nations of knowledge sources. We provided results both for coverage and translation
quality. As we noted above, we were able, as a consequence of our chosen methodol-
ogy, to evaluate the on-line MT systems used.
Where sentences are concerned, we saw that coverage was approximately the same
for each individual system, and that combinations of multiple knowledge sources did

not improve coverage. For NPs, however, coverage improved when more fragments
were considered: Whereas 474 NPs could be translated by both systems A (SDL) and C
(Logomedia), this number rose to 480 when all three knowledge sources were combined.
With respect to translation quality, whereas Logomedia and Reverso could hardly
be distinguished when it came to numbers of translations of sentences adjudged as
intelligible and syntactically correct, if we consider those translations considered un-
intelligible by our human evaluators, about twice as many translations produced by
chunks derived from Reverso were unintelligible compared to those produced by Lo-
gomedia. This would indicate that Logomedia may be better.
When fragments from combinations of systems are considered, we note that for
sentences, no improvement in coverage results, but quite significant improvements in
quality are seen. System C slightly outperformed system B in the individual face-off,
and we see that combinations that utilize chunks from system C outperform those
that do not: AC and BC both score 3 for quality in 80.4% of cases, compared to AB’s
78.7%, and ABC improves still further, to 81.5%. When the databases of wEBMT are
seeded with more chunks (using both singular and plural dummy subjects), system C
continues to outperform the other two systems.
When NPs are considered, system C considerably outperforms the other two sys-
tems, obtaining a score of 3 for quality in 10.2% more cases than its nearest challenger,
system B. When chunks from different systems are combined, again we see that com-
binations with chunks derived from system C outperform those that omit them: BC
and AC improve over AB by 10% and 18%, respectively, and ABC shows a further
increase.
Finally, in Section 4.4, we discussed the relative gain of using wEBMT over the
three on-line MT systems. Further evidence that Logomedia may be the best of the three
systems is provided by the fact that the relative gain compared to Logomedia was much
lower than with the other two systems.
It is worth considering why some combinations seem to work better than others.
For NPs, in cases where system A fails to produce the “best” translation, this is often
due to incorrect word order. For example, in the NP cellular mobile lines for the workmen,
system A produces the translation cellulaire mobile lignes pour les ouvriers.9 It is also the
case that when system A fails to retrieve a translation for a particular chunk, it simply
proposes the English for that chunk as its translation. This is useful to some extent,
in that a default translation is produced (cf. the similar approach that we have taken
with respect to (40), for instance). However, in all of these cases this utility is lessened
considerably given that either system B or system C produces a better translation.
System B has the added advantage that it sometimes provides an alternative translation
in brackets. If no translation is available, the English is output. System C often produces
a correct translation of a verb where the other systems are lacking. It is probably
because of this aspect of translation that system C’s translations are preferred over
those of the other two systems.

sion). We have shown that when a translation cannot be produced by combining
phrasal chunks, translations can be formed by the insertion of single marker words
into generalized templates. This can be compared to the idea of “hooks” (Somers,
McLean, and Jones 1994), where some context in which fragments have occurred is
maintained in the translation templates. The hooks indicate which words and POS
tags can occur in the immediate left and right context of a fragment, together with a
weight that reflects how often this context is found in a corpus. The “best” translation,
therefore, is simply that which is output by the system with the highest score.
Consider the translation of the NP the personal computers. There are three possible
ways in which this may be segmented using the marker hypothesis, namely, the chunks
in (49):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999548">

<bodyText confidence="0.996047107142857">
In our system, the only chunk retrieved is the generalized chunk in (49). The system
stores a list of marker words and their translations in the word-level lexicon. A weight
derived via the method in (32) is attached to each translation. The system searches
for marker words within the string and retrieves their translations.10 In this case, the
marker word in the string is the and its translation can be one of le, la, l’, or les,
depending on the context. The system simply attaches the translation with the highest
weight to the existing chunk ordinateurs personnels to produce the mistranslation in
(50):
(50) *la ordinateurs personnels
The problem of boundary friction is clearly visible here: We have inserted a feminine
singular determiner into a chunk that was generalized from a masculine plural NP.
However, rather than output this wrong translation directly, we use a post hoc val-
idation and (if required) correction process based on Grefenstette (1999). Grefenstette
shows that the Web can be used as a filter on translation quality simply by searching
for competing translation candidates and selecting the one that is found most often.
Rather than search for competing candidates, we select the “best” translation and have
its morphological variants searched for on-line. In the example above, namely, the per-
sonal computers, we search for les ordinateurs personnels versus the wrong alternatives
le/la/l’ordinateurs personnels. Interestingly, using Lycos, and setting the search language
to French, the correct form les ordinateurs personnels is uniquely preferred over the other
alternatives, as it is found 2,454 times, whereas the others are not found at all. In this
case, this translation overrides the highest-ranked translation (50) and is output as the
final translation. In fact, in checking the translations obtained for NPs using system
combination ABC, we noted that 251 NPs out of the test set of 500 could be improved.
Of these 251, 207 (82.5%) were improved post hoc via the Web, with no improvement
for the remaining 43 cases. We consider this to be quite a significant result.
In addition to determiner-noun agreement, we use this methodology to check for
agreement between the head noun in the subject NP with the head verb in the main

clause VP. We extracted a list of all verbs in the Penn-II Treebank and obtained trans-
lations for all verb forms using the three on-line MT systems by inserting appropriate
third-person dummy subjects. We use the list of translated verbs to attempt to find the
main verb and identify the head noun as the rightmost non–marker word or the right-
most word before any other marker word in a nominal chunk. Having extracted the
noun and the verb from the mistranslation in this way, we then search for this bigram
on the Web and correct the verb if its morphological variant (third-person singular or
third-person plural form) is found more often than in the translation obtained by our
system.
To exemplify this procedure with a sentence from the test set, his empire is beyond
the reach of the president, system A produces the translations in (51):
(51) a. *son empire sont au del`a de la port´ee du pr´esident (ranked first, with
probability 0.614)
b. son empire est au del`a de la port´ee du pr´esident (ranked fifth, with
probability 0.028)
This shows that a correct translation such as (51b) may be ranked lower than an incor-
rect variant (51a) with considerably less probability. The higher ranking is accounted
for because the pair (is beyond the reach of the president, sont au del`a de la port´ee du pr´esident)
is contained in the phrasal lexicon, whereas the pair (is beyond the reach of the president,
est au del`a de la port´ee du pr´esident) does not appear.
Prior to outputting translations such as (51a), we search for the relevant n-grams
via the Web. For this example, using AltaVista, we obtained the results in Table 11.
With the counts for all other bigrams for the two translation candidates in (51) being
exactly the same, in order to evaluate which of these proposed target strings is the
“better” translation, one can simply add the occurrences found on the Web for all four
different bigrams and report their relative probabilities. This gives us the probabilities
in (52):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9148095">
(52) a. #empire sont + #sont au = 91,550/311,179 = 0.294

That is, the string empire est au is about 2.4 times more likely than the string empire
sont au. However, the count for the second bigram in each example in (52) can of
course be discounted, as the juxtaposition of sont or est with au bears no relevance to
the correctness or otherwise of the translations in (51). The amended probabilities are,
therefore, those in (53):

Having given examples of how post hoc validation works within both NPs and
sentences, we summarize in Table 12 the results obtained when we tested the 58 sen-
tences whose translations contained subject-verb agreement errors owing to boundary
friction. Improvements were seen for translations derived from each of the on-line MT
systems: from a minimum of 58.6% (34 translations) for system A to a maximum of
76% (44 translations) for system C. For each system, no improvement was found for
two translations, and for 10 translations, our methodology could not tell definitively
whether the word to be corrected was a noun or a verb, so no change was made.
Finally, in a small number of cases (between 2 and 12 translations), the target string
was not found on the Web, so again, no change was made.
In order to be as accurate and relevant as possible, statistical language (and trans-
lation) models should be derived from corpora that are as large as possible, represen-
tative, and of high quality. Although the Web is large, this post hoc validation process
shows that despite the inherent noise contained on the Web because of the heteroge-
neous nature of the documents contained therein, it remains a resource that is of great
use in evaluating translation candidates.

We have presented an EBMT system based on the marker hypothesis that uses post
hoc validation and correction via the Web.11 Over 218,000 NPs and VPs were extracted
automatically from the Penn-II Treebank using just 59 of its 29,000 rule types. These
phrases were then translated automatically by three on-line MT systems. These trans-
lations gave rise to a number of automatically constructed linguistic resources: (1) the
original (source,target) phrasal translation pairs, (2) the marker lexicon, (3) the gen-

with input from multiple translation systems, with a postvalidation process via the Web (amounting to
an n-gram target language model), in effect forms a multiengine MT system as described by Frederking
and Nirenburg (1994), Frederking et al. (1994), and Hogan and Frederking (1998).

eralized lexicon, and (4) the word-level lexicon. When the system is confronted with
new input, these knowledge sources are searched in turn for matching chunks, and
the target language chunks are combined to create translation candidates.
We presented a number of experiments that showed how the system fared when
confronted with NPs and sentences. For the test set of 500 NPs, we obtained trans-
lations in 96% of cases, with 77.8% of the 500 NPs being translated correctly. For
sentences, we obtained translations in 92% of cases, with a completely correct transla-
tion obtained 81.5% of the time. Translation quality improved both when chunks from
different on-line systems were used and when the system’s memories were seeded
with both third-person singular and third-person plural forms. For both NPs and sen-
tences, we obtained intelligible translations in over 96% of cases. In most cases, the
“best” translation was ranked in the top 10 translations output by the system and was
always ranked in the top 1% of translation candidates. This facilitates the task of any
translator interacting with our system who needs to search for the “best” translation
among the alternatives provided.
We calculated the net gain of using wEBMT compared to the three on-line MT
systems. In some cases, an improvement of 50% was seen when EBMT was used.
As a consequence of the methodology chosen, we were able to perform a detailed
evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the three Web-based systems used in
our research, with Logomedia clearly outranking the other systems used. Neverthe-
less, adding chunks from the other two on-line MT systems improves both coverage
and translation quality. In sum, therefore, the best results are obtained when chunks
from all three on-line systems are used, and the system’s databases are seeded with
translations from these systems for both third-person singular and third-person plural
versions of sentences.
In addition, prior to the system’s outputting the best-ranked translation candidate,
morphological variants of certain components in the translation are searched for via
the Web in order to confirm it as the final output translation or to propose a corrected
alternative. Currently we validate our translations only with regard to subject head
noun–head verb agreement and determiner-noun agreement, but we plan to extend
this validation to cover more cases of boundary friction. We demonstrated that con-
siderable improvements can be made to the translations derived by the system by
submitting them to the Web for validation and correction.
A number of issues for further work present themselves. The decision to take only
those Penn-II rules occurring 1,000 or more times was completely arbitrary, and it
might be useful to include some strings corresponding to the less frequently occurring
structures in our database. Similarly, it would be a good idea to extend our word-level
lexicon by including more entries using rules in which the right-hand side contains a
single non-terminal.
Furthermore, the quality of the output was not taken into consideration when
selecting the on-line MT systems from which all our system resources are derived, so
that any results obtained may be further improved by selecting a “better” MT system
that permits batch processing.
We could expect a significant improvement in the results obtained if we were to im-
port the original sentences and their translations into a sentential database. Although
we insert dummy subject pronouns to derive appropriate finite verb forms, we do not
maintain these translation pairs as a resource for subsequent consultation and retrieval.
Although the chance of finding an exact match at sentential level is very low, it will
increase as more sentence pairs are added to the database, especially if we restrict the
domain of applicability of (a version of) our system to a particular sublanguage area.
However, the major improvement that can be expected is in the segmentation process:

Given that verbs are not a closed class, any verb will be contained within (part of) a
chunk pertaining to its subject NP. That is, although subject-verb agreement poses a
considerable problem to our system given the choice of original input material, this
particular instance of boundary friction will disappear if we segment our translation
pairs at the sentential rather than at the phrasal level.
In addition, we want to evaluate our system further with respect to larger data sets.
Manual evaluation is costly, both in terms of time and effort required. Accordingly,
in future work we plan to use automatic evaluation methodologies such as sentence
error rate or word error rate. These are very harsh metrics: Consider the example in
(54), extracted from the Canadian Hansards:
(54) Again this was voted down by the Liberal majority =⇒
Malheureusement, encore une fois, la majorite´ lib ´erale l’a rejet ´e.
Automatic evaluation measures presuppose the existence of an “oracle” (i.e., “cor-
rect”) translation produced by a human, such as here. Translations derived by the
MT system to be evaluated are then compared against the human translation. In the
example in (54), the human has inserted malheureusement although there is no sign of
unfortunately in the English source. If the perfect translation Encore une fois, la majorit´e
lib´erale l’a rejet´e were produced by an MT system, therefore, it would be penalized, as
the human translation is always considered to be the “correct” translation. We have
obtained a number of translation memories from two major computer companies, as
well as a large amount of monolingual data from the same domain, with which we
plan to test our system using automatic evaluation metrics in future work. This will
also enable us to test our EBMT methodology against other language pairs, which
may present the segmentation method employed with new challenges to overcome.
Finally, we plan to prioritize the lexical resources produced so that more weight-
ing would be given to translations derived from the phrasal and marker lexicons as
opposed to those derived via word insertion from the word level lexicon and the
generalized templates.
In sum, we have demonstrated that using a “linguistics-lite” approach based on
the marker hypothesis, with a large number of phrases extracted automatically from
a very small number of the rules in the Penn Treebank, many new reusable linguistic
resources can be derived automatically that can be utilized in an EBMT system capable
of translating new input with quite reasonable rates of success. We have demonstrated
that a net gain may be achieved by using EBMT over on-line MT systems. We have
also shown that the Web can be used to validate and correct candidate translations
prior to their being output.

<abstract confidence="0.978229923076923">We have developed an example-based machine translation (EBMT) system that uses the World Wide Web for two different purposes: First, we populate the system’s memory with translations gathered from rule-based MT systems located on the Web. The source strings input to these systems were extracted automaticallyfrom an extremely small subset of the rule types in the Penn- Treebank. In subsequent stages, the pairs obtained are automatically transformed into a series of resources that render the translation process more successful. Despite the fact that the output from on-line MT systems is often faulty, we demonstrate in a number of experiments that when used to seed the memories of an EBMT system, they can in fact prove useful in generating translations of high quality in a robust fashion. In addition, we demonstrate the relative gain of EBMT in comparison to on-line systems. Second, despite the perception that the documents available on the Web are of questionable quality, we demonstrate in contrast that such resources are extremely useful in automatically postediting translation candidates proposed by our system.</abstract>

The respective lengths of the putative alignments in terms of characters is also an important factor. Ahrenberg, Andersson, and Merkel (2002) observe that for less widely spoken languages, the relative lack of linguistic tools and resources has forced developers of word alignment tools for such languages to use shallow processing and basic statistical approaches to word linking. Accordingly, they generate lexical correspondences by means of co-occurrence measures and string similarity metrics. More specifically, the notion of the phrasal lexicon (used first by Becker 1975) has been used successfully in a number of areas: • Learnability (Zernik and Dyer 1987) • Text generation (Hovy 1988; Milosavljevic, Tulloch, and Dale 1996) • Speech generation (Rayner and Carter 1997) • Localization (Sch¨aler 1996) More recently, Simard and Langlais (2001) have proposed the exploitation of TMs at a subsentential level, while Carl, Way, and Sch¨aler (2002) and Sch¨aler, Way, and Carl (2003, pages 108–109) describe how phrasal lexicons might come to occupy a central place in a future hybrid integrated translation environment.

Following construction of the marker lexicon, the (source, target) chunks are generalized further using a methodology based on Block (2000) to permit a limited form of insertion in the translation process. As a byproduct of the chosen methodology, we also derive a standard ”word-level” translation lexicon. These various resources render the set of original translation pairs far more useful in deriving translations of previously unseen input. In Section 3, we describe in detail the segmentation process, together with the procedure whereby target chunks are combined to produce candidate translations. In Section 4, we report initially on two experiments in which we test different versions of our EBMT system against test sets of NPs </context>

From this initial resource, we subsequently derive a number of different databases that together allow many new input sentences to be translated that it would not be possible to translate in other systems. First, the phrasal lexicon is segmented using the marker hypothesis to produce a marker lexicon. This is then generalized, following a methodology based on Block (2000), to generate the “generalized marker lexicon.” Finally, as a result of the 3 We refer the interested reader to the excellent and comprehensive bibliography on parallel text processing available at http://www.up.univ-mrs.fr/˜veronis/biblios/ptp.htm. 426 Way and Gough wEBMT methodology chosen, we automatically derive a fourth resource, namely, a “word-level lexicon.” 2.1 The Phrasal Lexicon Our phrasal lexicon was built by selecting a set of 218,697 English noun phrases and verb phrases from the Penn Treebank. We identified all rule types occurring 1,000 or more times and eliminated those that </context>
<context position="32136" citStr="Block (2000)" startWordPosition="5212" endWordPosition="5213">t is, a present participle. Given this information, in such cases we tag such words with the &lt;LEX&gt; tag. Taking expanding the board to 14 members −&gt; augmente le conseil a` 14 membres as an example, we extract the chunks in (24): &lt;DET&gt; the board : le conseil &lt;DET&gt; the : le &lt;PREP&gt; to &lt;QUANT&gt; 14 members : a` 14 membres &lt;QUANT&gt; 14 members : 14 membres &lt;LEX&gt; expanding : augmente &lt;LEX&gt; board : conseil &lt;PREP&gt; to : a` &lt;LEX&gt; members : membres We ignore here the trivially true lexical chunk “&lt;QUANT&gt; 14 : 14.” In a final processing stage, we generalize over the marker lexicon following a process found in Block (2000). In Block’s approach, word alignments are assigned probabilities by means of a statistical word alignment tool. In a subsequent stage, chunk pairs are extracted, which are then generalized to produce a set of translation templates for each (source, target) segment. Block distinguishes chunks from “patterns,” as we do: His chunks are similar to our marker chunks, and his patterns are similar to our generalized marker chunks. Once chunks are derived from (source, target) alignments, patterns are computed from the derived chunks by means of the following algorithm: “for each pair of chunk pairs </context>

In our system, in some cases the smallest chunk obtainable via the marker-based segmentation process may be something like (27): (27) &lt;DET&gt; the good man: le bon homme In such cases, if our system were confronted with a good man, it would not be able to translate such a phrase, assuming this to be missing from the marker lexicon. Accordingly, we convert examples such as (27) into their generalized equivalents, as in (28): (28) &lt;DET&gt; good man: bon homme That is, where Block (2000) substitutes variables for various words in his templates, we replace certain lexical items with their marker tag. Given that examples such as ’‘&lt;DET&gt; a : un” are likely to exist in the word-level lexicon, they may be inserted at the point indicated by the marker tag to form the correct translation un bon homme.

Accordingly, we convert examples such as (27) into their generalized equivalents, as in (28): (28) &lt;DET&gt; good man: bon homme That is, where Block (2000) substitutes variables for various words in his templates, we replace certain lexical</context>

When translated phrases have been retrieved for each chunk of the input string, they must then be combined to produce an output string. In order to calculate a ranking for each TL sentence produced, we multiply the weights of each chunk used in its construction. Note that this ensures that greater importance is attributed to longer chunks, as is usual in most EBMT systems (cf. Sato and Nagao 1990; Veale and Way 1997; Carl 1999).7 As an example, consider the translation into French of the house collapsed. Assume the conditional probabilities in (33): 7 Note that approaches that prefer the greatest context to be taken into account are not limited to EBMT. Research in the area of data-oriented parsing (cf. Bod, Scha, and Sima’an, 2003) also shows that unless the corpus is inherently biased, derivations constructed using the smallest number of subtrees have a higher probability than those built with a larger number of smaller subtrees. 435 Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 3 (33) a.

There is a wealth of literature on trying to establish subsentential translations from a bilingual corpus.3 Kay and R¨oscheisen (1993) attempt to extract a bilingual dictionary using a hybrid method of sentence and word alignment on the assumption that the (source, target) words have a similar distribution. Fung and McKeown (1997) attempt to translate technical terms using word relation matrices, although the resource from which such relations are derived is a pair of nonparallel corpora. Somers (1998) replicates the work of Fung and McKeown with different language pairs using the simpler metric of Levenshtein distance. Boutsis and Piperidis (1998) use a tagged parallel corpus to extract translationally equivalent English-Greek clauses on the basis of word occurrence and co-occurrence probabilities. The respective lengths of the putative alignments in terms of characters is also an important factor. Ahrenberg, Andersso</context>

In Section 2, we describe how we automatically obtain a hierarchy of lexical resources that are used sequentially by our EBMT system, wEBMT, to translate new input. The primary resource gathered is a “phrasal lexicon,” constructed by extracting over 200,000 phrases from the Penn Treebank and having them translated into French by three Web-based machine translation (MT) systems. Each set of translations is stored separately, and for each set the “marker hypothesis” (Green 1979) is used to segment the phrasal lexicon into a “marker lexicon.” The marker hypothesis is a universal psycholinguistic constraint which states that natural languages are ”marked” for complex syntactic structure at surface form by a closed set of specific lexemes and morphemes. That is, a basic phrase-level segmentation of an input sentence can be achieved by exploiting a closed list of known marker words to signal the start and end of each segment. Consider the following example, selected at random from the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn-II Treebank: (5) The Dearborn, Mich., energy co</context>

The sets of determiners and possessive pronouns are both very small. Furthermore, there are four prepositional phrases, and the set of prepositions is similarly small. A further assumption that could be made is that all words that end with -ed are verbs, such as stopped in (5). The marker hypothesis is arguably universal in presuming that concepts and structures like these have similar morphological or structural marking in all languages. The marker hypothesis has been used for a number of different language-related tasks, including • language learning (Green 1979; Mori and Moeser 1983; Morgan, Meier, and Newport 1989) • monolingual grammar induction (Juola 1998) • grammar optimization (Juola 1994) • insights into universal grammar (Juola 1998) • machine translation (Juola 1994, 1997; Veale and Way 1997; Gough, Way, and Hearne 2002) With respect to translation, a potential problem in using the marker hypothesis is that some languages do not have marker words such as articles, for instance.

The system simply attaches the translation with the highest weight to the existing chunk ordinateurs personnels to produce the mistranslation in (50): (50) *la ordinateurs personnels The problem of boundary friction is clearly visible here: We have inserted a feminine singular determiner into a chunk that was generalized from a masculine plural NP. However, rather than output this wrong translation directly, we use a post hoc validation and (if required) correction process based on Grefenstette (1999). Grefenstette shows that the Web can be used as a filter on translation quality simply by searching for competing translation candidates and selecting the one that is found most often. Rather than search for competing candidates, we select the “best” translation and have its morphological variants searched for on-line. In the example above, namely, the personal computers, we search for les ordinateurs personnels versus the wrong alternatives le/la/l’ordinateurs personnels.

Accordingly, they generate lexical correspondences by means of co-occurrence measures and string similarity metrics. More specifically, the notion of the phrasal lexicon (used first by Becker 1975) has been used successfully in a number of areas: • Learnability (Zernik and Dyer 1987) • Text generation (Hovy 1988; Milosavljevic, Tulloch, and Dale 1996) • Speech generation (Rayner and Carter 1997) • Localization (Sch¨aler 1996) More recently, Simard and Langlais (2001) have proposed the exploitation of TMs at a subsentential level, while Carl, Way, and Sch¨aler (2002) and Sch¨aler, Way, and Carl (2003, pages 108–109) describe how phrasal lexicons might come to occupy a central place in a future hybrid integrated translation environment.

Juola’s (1994, 1998) work on grammar optimization and induction shows that context-free grammars can be converted to ”marker-normal form.” However, marker-normal form grammars cannot capture the sorts of regularities demonstrated for languages that do not have a oneto-one mapping between a terminal symbol and a word. Nevertheless, Juola (1998, page 23) observes that “a slightly more general mapping, where two adjacent terminal symbols can be merged into a single lexical item (for example, a word and its case-marking), can capture this sort of result quite handily.” Work using the marker hypothesis for MT adapts this monolingual mapping for pairs of languages: It is reasonably straightforward to map an English determiner-noun sequence onto a Japanese noun–case marker segment, once one has identified the sets of marker tags in the languages to be translated.

We would like to incorporate into our model a procedure whereby translation chunks extracted from the phrasal and marker lexicons are more highly regarded than those constructed by inserting words from the word-level lexicon into generalized marker chunks. That is, we want to allocate a larger portion of the probability space to the phrasal and marker lexicons than to the generalized or wordlevel lexicons. We have yet to import such a constraint into our model, but we plan to do so in the near future using the weighted majority algorithm (Littlestone and Warmuth 1992). 4. Experiments and System Evaluation We report here on a number of experiments using test sets of 200 sentences and 500 noun phrases. Some typical examples from the two test sets are given in (39): (39) Noun phrases: • the heavy use of management fees last year • an increase through issues of new shares and convertible bonds • a space-based defense shield for official acts by the congressman Sentences: • The bright red one interferes with the genes that are responsible for collecting pollen. • A more recent novel permitted the new basket product. • The area with the museums and the charities</context>

TM systems store a set of (source, target) translation pairs in their databases. If a new input string cannot be found exactly in the translation database, a search is conducted for close (or “fuzzy”) matches of the input string, and these are retrieved together with their translations for the translator to manipulate into the final, output translation. From this description, it should be clear that TM systems do not translate: Indeed, some researchers consider them to be little more than a search-and-replace engine, albeit a rather sophisticated one (Macklovitch and Russell 2000). We can illustrate this with respect to the TM entries in (1), taken from the Canadian Hansards: (1) a.

Furthermore, there are four prepositional phrases, and the set of prepositions is similarly small. A further assumption that could be made is that all words that end with -ed are verbs, such as stopped in (5). The marker hypothesis is arguably universal in presuming that concepts and structures like these have similar morphological or structural marking in all languages. The marker hypothesis has been used for a number of different language-related tasks, including • language learning (Green 1979; Mori and Moeser 1983; Morgan, Meier, and Newport 1989) • monolingual grammar induction (Juola 1998) • grammar optimization (Juola 1994) • insights into universal grammar (Juola 1998) • machine translation (Juola 1994, 1997; Veale and Way 1997; Gough, Way, and Hearne 2002) With respect to translation, a potential problem in using the marker hypothesis is that some languages do not have marker words such as articles, for instance.

Bod, Scha, and Sima’an, 2003) also shows that unless the corpus is inherently biased, derivations constructed using the smallest number of subtrees have a higher probability than those built with a larger number of smaller subtrees. 435 Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 3 (33) a.

( [V ist was Sie], [V is what you] ) ... ( [das ist was V wollten], [which is what V wanted] ) ... Of course, many other researchers also try to extract generalized templates. Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto (1992) identify translationally equivalent phrasal segments and replace such equivalents with variables to generate a set of translation patterns. Watanabe (1993) combines lexical and dependency mappings to form his generalizations. Other similar approaches include those of Cicekli and G¨uvenir (1996), McTait and Trujillo (1999), Carl (1999), and Brown (2000), inter alia. In our system, in some cases the smallest chunk obtainable via the marker-based segmentation process may be something like (27): (27) &lt;DET&gt; the good man: le bon homme In such cases, if our system were confronted with a good man, it would not be able to translate such a phrase, assuming this to be missing from the marker lexicon. Accordingly, we convert examples such as (27) into their</context>

Ahrenberg, Andersson, and Merkel (2002) observe that for less widely spoken languages, the relative lack of linguistic tools and resources has forced developers of word alignment tools for such languages to use shallow processing and basic statistical approaches to word linking. Accordingly, they generate lexical correspondences by means of co-occurrence measures and string similarity metrics. More specifically, the notion of the phrasal lexicon (used first by Becker 1975) has been used successfully in a number of areas: • Learnability (Zernik and Dyer 1987) • Text generation (Hovy 1988; Milosavljevic, Tulloch, and Dale 1996) • Speech generation (Rayner and Carter 1997) • Localization (Sch¨aler 1996) More recently, Simard and Langlais (2001) have proposed the exploitation of TMs at a subsentential level, while Carl, Way, and Sch¨aler (2002) and Sch¨aler, Way, and Carl (2003, pages 108–109) describe how phrasal lexicons might come to occupy a central place in a future hybrid integrated translation environment. This, they suggest, may result in a paradigm shift from TM to EBMT via the phrasal lexicon: Translators are on the whole wary of MT technol</context>
