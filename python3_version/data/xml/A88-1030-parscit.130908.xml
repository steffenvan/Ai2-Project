The paper presents and compares two different
methods of parsing, a regular expression method
and a stochastic method, with respect to their
success in identifying basic clauses in
unrestricted English text. These methods of
parsing were developed in order to be applied to
the task of improving the detection of large
prosodic units in the Bell Labs text-to-speech
system, and were so applied experimentally.
The paper also discusses the notion of basic
clause that was defined as the parsing target.
The result of a comparison of the error rates of
the two parsing methods in the recognition of
basic clauses showed that there was a 13% error
rate for the regular expression method and a
6.5% error rate for the stochastic method.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999922166666667">
The present paper describes the procedure that
was followed in an extended experiment to
reliably find basic surface clauses in unrestricted
English text, using various combinations of
finitary and stochastic methods. The purpose was
to make some improvements in the detection and
treatment of large prosodic units above the level
of fgroups in the Bell Labs text-to-speech
system. This system currently relies exclusively
on punctuation (commas and periods) for the
detection of such units, i.e. tonal minor and
major phrases. Commas are correlated with
tonal minor phrases, and sentence final periods
with tonal major phrases. The notion of fgroup
(one or more function words followed by one or
more content words), and its implementation in
the Bell Labs text-to-speech system is described
in Liberman &amp; Buchsbaum (1985).
Correct automatic detection of major syntactic
boundaries, in particular clause boundaries, is a
prerequisite for automatic insertion of final
lengthening, boundary tones and pauses at such
boundaries within sentences (cf. Allen, Hunnicutt
&amp; Klatt 1987,and Altenberg 1987). These
prosodic phenomena make significant
contribution to the naturalness and intelligibility
of synthetic speech. Unfortunately, the task of
parsing unrestricted text correctly, in order to
find the relevant sentence internal syntactic
boundaries has turned out to be very difficult.
This paper is a report of an attempt to provide a
better foundation for parsing text by the use of
simple fmitary and stochastic computational
methods. These simple methods have not
figured prominently in the theory and practice of
natural langauge parsing, with some exceptions
(Langendoen 1975, Church 1982, Ejerhed &amp;
Church 1983). For an experimental, and more
complicated method to derive all prosodic units
in the text-to-speech system, i.e. not just tonal
minor and major phrases but every type of
prosodic unit, from the syntactic structure and
length of constituents, see Wright, Bachenko &amp;
Fitzpatrick (1986).
The first purpose of the experiment was to test
the performance of a finite state parser, when the
parser was given the rather difficult and
substantive tasks of finding basic, non-recursive
clauses in continuous text, in which each word
had been tagged with a part of speech label.
Parts of the tagged Brown corpus were used,
representing the genres of both informative and
imaginative prose. The clause grammar,
consisting of a regular expression for clauses of
different kinds, was constructed by the author
and it was first applied to text that was
guaranteed to have correct parts of speech
assigned to the words, so that problems in
constructing the grammar could be isolated from
problems in assigning correct parts of speech.
The finite state parser that used the clause
grammar consisted of a program that matched
regular expressions for clauses against the
longest substrings of tagged words that fit them,
and it was constructed and implemented by K.
Church.
The second purpose was to see whether basic
clauses could also be recognized by stochastic
programs, after these had been trained on
suitable training material. The training material
was prepared by hand-correcting the output of
the program that processed the regular

expressions for clauses. A stochastic program for
assigning unique part of speech tags to words in
unrestricted text had been created by K. Church,
and trained on the tagged Brown corpus (see
Church 1987). The resultant program is 95-99%
correct in its performance, depending on the
criteria of correctness used, and it can be used as
a lexical front end to any kind of parser, i.e. not
necessarily stochastic or finite state parsers.
However, the question presented itself whether
the stochastic procedure that was so successful in
recognizing parts of speech could also be applied
to more advanced tasks such as recognizing noun
phrases and clauses. The present paper
concentrates on the parsing of basic clauses. The
parsing of noun phrases by the same two
methods is compared in Ejethed (1987), and the
stochastic parsing of noun phrases is described in
detail in Church (1987).
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section
2 defines the target of a basic clause, and reports
on the outcome of the search for such units by
the two methods. Section 3 discusses the
correlations between clause units as defined by
this paper, and the prosodic units of tonal minor
and major phrases in the Bell Labs text-to-
speech system.

2. Finding Clauses
2.1 Why Clauses?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915076923077">
Syntactic surface clauses are interesting units of
language processing for a variety of reasons. In
the surface clause, criteria of form and meaning
converge to guarantee both that it can be
recognized solely by surface syntactic properties
and that it constitutes a meaningful unit (ideally
a proposition) in a semantic representation.
Clauses have been investigated in
psycholinguistic research. Jarvella (1971) found
effects of both sentence boundaries and clause
boundaries in recall of spoken complex sentences
and took them, along with previous results of
Jarvella &amp; Pisoni (1970), to support a clause-by-
clause view of within-sentence processing.
Later research on reading comprehension has
found effects on gaze duration not only of word
length and word frequency, but also of syntactic
local ambiguity (garden paths) and of ends of
sentences (Just &amp; Carpenter 1984). However,
the study of clause units as distinct from
sentence units has not been carried out
systematically in psycholinguistic experiments so
far, and a lot of basic facts remain to be found
out about the role of clause units of different
kinds in the processes whereby spoken and
written language is comprehended.

2.2 The Definition of A Basic Clause
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997288372093">
Finding basic noun phrases is important as a
stepping stone to finding clauses, on the
assumption that an important subset of them
have an initial sequence consisting of a noun
phrase followed by a tensed verb as a defining
characteristic. The result of scoring the
respective success of the two methods of parsing
basic noun phrases in sample text portions,
reported in Ejerhed (1987), was the following.
The regular expression output had 6 errors in
185 noun phrases, i.e. a 3.3% error rate. The
stochastic output had 3 errors in 218 noun
phrases, i.e. a 1.4% error rate. Both results must
be considered good in the absolute sense of an
automatic analysis of unrestricted text, but the
stochastic method has a clear advantage over the
regular expression method. Basic noun phrases
can be found, which is of important for clause
recognition.
The definition of basic clause that was used in
this study has the following characteristics: a) it
concentrates on certain defining characteristics
present at the beginnings of clauses; b) it follows
from a particular hypothesis about syntactic
working memory: that it is limited to processing
one clause at the time; and c) it assumes that the
recognition of any beginning of a clause
automatically leads to the syntactic closure of the
previous clause.
It should be clear from the above, that the
theoretical reasons for pursuing a recursion-free
definition of a basic clause have to do with a
theory of linguistic performance, rather than with
a theory of linguistic competence, in which
memory limitations play no part. It is a
hypothesis of the author&apos;s current clause-by-
clause processing theory, that a unit
corresponding to the basic clause is a stable and
easily reco.ni7able surface unit, and that it is
also an important partial result and building
block in the construction of a richer linguistic
representation that encompasses syntax as well
as semantics and discourse structure.

23 A Regular Expression for Basic Clauses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996913666666667">
Several versions of a regular expression for basic
clauses were written by the author and preceded
the one presented in Appendix 1, which was,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.996139379310345">
applied to 60 files of Brown corpus tagged text
of 2000 words each, newspaper texts A01-A20,
scientific texts J01-120 and fiction texts K01-
K20.
The first half of the definition of *clause*
introduces a few auxiliary definitions: comp for a
set of complementizers, punct for a set of
punctuation marks, and tense for a set of verb
forms that are either certainly tensed (&amp;quot;BED&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;BEDZ&amp;quot; &amp;quot;BEM&amp;quot; &amp;quot;BER&amp;quot; &amp;quot;BEZ&amp;quot; &amp;quot;DOD&amp;quot; &amp;quot;DOZ&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;HV)&amp;quot; &amp;quot;HVZ&amp;quot; &amp;quot;MD&amp;quot; &amp;quot;VBD&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;or
possibly tensed (&amp;quot;BE&amp;quot; &amp;quot;DO&amp;quot; &amp;quot;HV&amp;quot; &amp;quot;VB&amp;quot;). The
definition of clause also uses the previously
defined *brown-np-regex*. The second and
larger part of the definition of *clause* consists
of a union of six concatenations.
The first defines complete main clauses as
consisting of a sequence of an optional
coordinating conjunction CC followed by an
obligatory basic noun phrase followed by
optional non-clausal complements and an
optional adverb followed by an obligatory tensed
verb followed by anything expcept the
punctuations or complementizers indicated in the
list after (not ..., followed by optional
punctuation.
The second defines clauses introduced by an
obligatory CC followed by an optional adverb
followed by an obligatory element which is
either a tensed or participial verb form, followed
by the same clause ending as in the first
definition.
The third concatenation defines a subordinate
clause as starting with an optional coordinating
conjunction followed by an obligatory
complementizer followed by the same clause
ending as in the first and second definitions.
The remaining three definitions are of clause
fragments rather than full clauses. Consider the
following sentence: The man [who liked ice
cream,] ate too much.
In it, the relative clause makes a basic clause
unit that breaks up the main clause into two
clause fragments. The third concatenation
defines noun phrase fragments that begin with a
basic noun phrase followed optionally by one or
more prepositional phrases, or sequences of CC
np or $ np, followed by the same clause ending
as in the other definitions. In the example above,
[the man] would be a noun phrase fragment.
The fifth concatenation defines verb phrase
fragments, e.g. [ate too much].
The sixth concatenation defines clause fragments
that are adjuncts, i.e. adverbial phrases,
prepositional phrases and adjective phrases. The
typical case in which such a fragment is
recognized is when it precedes another clause:
[On a clear day,] [you can see forever].

The regular expression in Appendix 1 was
automatically expanded into a deterministic fsa

rule compilation will not be described hem. An
excerpt from the result of applying it to the 60

is presented in Appendix 2, where the location
and nature of hand-corrections have been high-

followed by a tensed verb. Although the second
concatenation in the clause regex aimes at
capturing such clauses, it is not always
successful in doing so because there is no way,
given the current implementation of negation in
the regular expression program, to state that a
clause should end before a concatenation of
items, i.e. before (* CC tense). Only single
items can be negated at present. Example: [The
Purchasing Departments are well operated] [and
follow generally accepted practices].

4) There should be a clause boundary before a
preposition (IN) followed by a wh-word, i.e.
before (* IN (+ WDT WPO WP$ WRB WQL)).
For the same reason given under 3), there is no
way currently to state that a clause should end
before such a sequence. Example: [The City
Executive Committee deserves praise for the
manner] [in which the election was conducted].

Several interesting observation were made in the
course of doing these hand-corrections. For one,
there were errors in the Brown corpus
assignment of tags, in particular several errors
confusing VBD and VBN, and there were errors
where the sequence TO VB was tagged IN NN.
More seriously, it turned out that the words as
and like, which have the property of functioning
either like prepostions IN or subordinating
conjunctions CS were always tagged CS, thus
leading to incorrect recognition of clauses in
many cases. Another problem for recognizing
clauses on the basis of identifying tensed verbs
was that the tag VB is applied to forms that are
either infinitival or present tensed (or
subjunctive), depending on context. It would
have been better if such forms had been
considered lexically ambiguous and given
distinct tags. However, by and large the tagged
Brown corpus is a very good and useful product,
both in the choice of tags, and in the consistency
with which they have been applied. Doing the
hand-correction also forced the realization that
the clause recognition program, like the noun
phrase recognition program, dependes crucially
on accurate assignment of parts of speech to all
words, on order to work well. For this task,
Church&apos;s stochastic parts program is admirably
suited, since it gives correct assignments in a
very large number of cases, and it holds the
potential of further improvement in its
performance with further training.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.869614">
2.5 Stochastic Recognition of Clauses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995833333334">
As stated before, the regex *clause* was applied
to sixty texts in the Brown corpus, and the
output was hand-corrected. The hand-corrected
files, containing an estimated total of at least
20,000 basic clauses, including clause fragments,
were then used as training material for a
stochastic recognition program. The training
consisted of observing the location of clause
opens and clause closes, and a special training
specifically in locating tensed verbs. After
training, the stochastic parts program and
thereafter the stochastic clause recognizer was
applied by K. Church to a large amount of
Associated Press newswire text from May 26,
1987 (526 blocks, 2381353(8) bytes). An
excerpt of the result is presented in Appendix 3.
The result, again, is strikingly good.
A comparison of the nature and amount of errors
in reco•ni7ing basic clauses in a sample of
uncorrected regex output, and a sample of output
from the stochastic clause program, can be made
on the basis of Tables 1 and 2 at the end.
It appears that the stochastic program is more
successful than the current regular expression
method. However, certain improvements in the
regex program could change that. What is
needed is the facility to process generalized
regular expressions, which admit the operations
of complement and intersection, in addition to
the operations of concatenation, union and
Kleene star that characterize regular expressions.
In any case there are some interesting differences
in the kinds of errors made by the current regex
program and the stochastic one for recognizing
clauses. The regex program systematically errs
by underrecognizing, never by overrecognizing,
and in the selected portions that were scored, it
only puts a few clause boundaries in the wrong
place. It misses lots of clause boundaries, but
the ones it gets are mostly correct.
The stochastic program, on the other hand, is
able to get many clause boundaries correctly that
elude the regular expression matcher, e.g.
clauses not introduced by complementizers. The
stochastic program errs both by overrecognizing
and underrecogniimg clauses, and sometimes it
also places the clause open or clause close in the
wrong place. Some cases of incorrect clause
recognition are due to incorrect assignments of
parts of speech to words. However, the total
number of errors with the stochastic method (21)
is smaller than the total number of errors with
the regex method (40), for approximately the
same number of clauses to be recugnized, 304
versus 308. This is a very surprising outcome
indeed, and if taken literally, without any further
weighting of the different types of errors, it
means that the error rate for the stochastic
method for recognizing clauses is 6.5%, as
compared with 13% for the regex method.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998293">
Finding bask, lause units in arbitrary text is
necessary in order to locate tonal minor phrases,
which, in addition to a phrase accent, also have a
boundary tone, and, particularly at slow rates of
speech, a pause at the end of the phrase. The
current experiment in text analysis has been
concerned primarily with informative rather than
imaginative prose, and envisages applications of
the text-to-speech system to the reading of
informative prose like newspaper text.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994127">

<bodyText confidence="0.999980461538462">
In the current Bell Labs text-to-speech system,
tonal minor phrase boundaries are identified on
the basis of commas, and tonal major phrase
boundaries are identified on the basis of periods.
Finding more tonal minor phrase boundaries by
using syntactic structure, in addition to
punctuation, is the problem we are trying to
address with the methods described in this paper.
In order to know where tonal minor phrase
boundaries actually occur in the reading of
informative texts, which typically have very long
sentences (an average of 21 words compared
with 14 words in general fiction based on Brown
corpus data), it would be necessary to make
recordings of several persons reading both
authentic and prepared texts in a rhetorically
explicit way, to borrow a phrase from Beckman
&amp; Pierrehumbert (1986), and then make extensive
speech analyses of them, particularly of
fundamental frequency movements and pauses.
In the absence of such data for American
English, the following kinds of boundaries
between clauses and clause fragments were
hypothesized to constitute intonation breaks with
the status of tonal minor phrase boundaries. They
are marked with # in the examples below.

c) After other noun phrases with clausal

For testing purposes, short passages of seven
consecutive sentences each from the Brown files,
and four sentences each from the AP newswire
stories were synthesized by the author, using the
Bell Labs text-to-speech system. Those
boundaries between clauses and clause fragments
that are identified above were implemented in
the same way that commas are, i.e. with a phrase
accent belonging to the tonal minor phrase, final
lengthening, a boundary tone, and a short pause
of 200 ms. The results have not yet been
subjected to perceptual tests.
There are some studies of the relation between
clause units and intonation units that provide
relevant data for future work. Garding (1967)
studied prosodic features in spontaneous and
read Swedish speech. She found that in the
spontaneous speech, pauses were equally divided
between syntactic pauses and hesitation pauses, a
syntactic pause being defined as one that
coincides with a syntactic boundary. In the read
speech, all pauses were syntactic pauses: &amp;quot;They
appear between main clause and subordinate
clause, before adverbial modifiers and between
the different parts of an enumeration. The pause
length is shortest in enumerations and before
relative clauses (4-10 cs) and longest before
adverbial modifiers and between complete
sentences.&amp;quot; (p. 48).
In a study of the intonational properties of
relative clauses in British English, Taglicht
(1977) compared the speech of a news broadcast
with impromptu speech, and found that both
genres separated nonrestrictive relative clauses
prosodically. The news broadcast also separated
a large proportion (71%) of the restrictive
relative clauses prosodically.
A recent and very extensive study of the
grammtical properties of intonation units, or tone
units (TU) is Altenberg (1987). He studied a
monologue of 48 minutes duration from the
London-Lund Corpus of spoken English, and his
results concerning the correlation of clause
boundaries and tone unit boundaries are
presented in Table 3 at the end.

<abstract confidence="0.998403764705882">The paper presents and compares two different methods of parsing, a regular expression method and a stochastic method, with respect to their success in identifying basic clauses in unrestricted English text. These methods of parsing were developed in order to be applied to the task of improving the detection of large prosodic units in the Bell Labs text-to-speech system, and were so applied experimentally. The paper also discusses the notion of basic clause that was defined as the parsing target. The result of a comparison of the error rates of the two parsing methods in the recognition of basic clauses showed that there was a 13% error rate for the regular expression method and a 6.5% error rate for the stochastic method.</abstract>
