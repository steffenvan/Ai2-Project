This paper reports on corpus-based research
into the relationship between intonational vari-
ation and discourse structure. We examine the
effects of speaking style (read versus sponta-
neous) and of discourse segmentation method
(text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the na-
ture of this relationship. We also compare
the acoustic-prosodic features of initial, me-
dial, and final utterances in a discourse seg-

This paper presents empirical support for the as-
sumption long held by computational linguists, that
intonation can provide valuable cues for discourse
processing. The relationship between intonational
variation and discourse structure has been explored
in a new corpus of direction-giving monologues. We
examine the effects of speaking style (read versus
spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method
(text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of
this relationship. We also compare the acoustic-
prosodic features of initial, medial, and final utter-
ances in a discourse segment. A better understand-
ing of the role of intonation in conveying discourse
structure will enable improvements in the natural-
ness of intonational variation in text-to-speech sys-
tems as well as in algorithms for recognizing dis-
course structure in speech-understanding systems.

It has long been assumed in computational lin-
guistics that discourse structure plays an impor-
tant role in Natural Language Understanding tasks
such as identifying speaker intentions and resolving
anaphoric reference. Previous research has found

that discourse structural information can be inferred
from orthographic cues in text, such as paragraph-
ing and punctuation; from linguistic cues in text
or speech, such as CUE PHRASES1 (Cohen, 1984;
Reichman, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Passon-
neau and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman,
to appear) and other lexical cues (Hinkelman and
Allen, 1989); from variation in referring expres-
sions (Linde, 1979; Levy, 1984; Grosz and Sidner,
1986; Webber, 1988; Song and Cohen, 1991; Passon-
neau and Litman, 1993), tense, and aspect (Schu-
bert and Hwang, 1990; Song and Cohen, 1991);
from knowledge of the domain, especially for task-
oriented discourses (Grosz, 1978); and from speaker
intentions (Carberry, 1990; Litman and Hirschberg,
1990; Lochbaum, 1994). Recent methods for auto-
matic recognition of discourse structure from text
have incorporated thesaurus-based and other in-
formation retrieval techniques to identify changes
in topic (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Yarowsky, 1991;
Iwanska et al., 1991; Hearst, 1994; Reynar, 1994).
Parallel investigations on prosodic/acoustic cues
to discourse structure have investigated the contri-
butions of features such as pitch range, pausal du-
ration, amplitude, speaking rate, and intonational
contour to signaling topic change. Variation in pitch
range has often been seen as conveying &apos;topic struc-
ture&apos; in discourse. Brown et al. (1980) found that
subjects typically started new topics relatively high
in their pitch range and finished topics by com-
pressing their range. Silverman (1987) found that
manipulation of pitch range alone, or in conjunc-
tion with pausal duration between utterances, facil-
itated the disambiguation of ambiguous topic struc-
tures. Avesani and Vayra (1988) also found variation
in pitch range in professional recordings which ap-
peared to correlate with topic structure, and Ayers
(1992) found that pitch range correlates with hierar-
chical topic structure more closely in read than spon-
taneous conversational speech. Duration of pause
between utterances or phrases has also been identi-
&apos;Also called DISCOURSE MARKERS or DISCOURSE PAR-
TICLES, these are items such as now, first, and by the way,
which explicitly mark discourse structure.

fled as an indicator of topic structure, with longer
pauses marking major topic shifts (Lehiste, 1979;
Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy, 1980; Avesani and
Vayra, 1988; Passonneau and Litman, 1993); Wood-
bury (1987), however, found no such correlation in
his data. Amplitude was also found to increase at
the start of a new topic and decrease at the end
(Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy, 1980). Swerts and
colleagues (1992) found that melody and duration
can pre-signal the end of a discourse unit, in ad-
dition to marking the discourse-unit-final utterance
itself. And speaking rate has been found to cor-
relate with structural variation; in several studies
(Lehiste, 1980; Brubaker, 1972; Butterworth, 1975)
segment-initial utterances exhibited slower rates,
and segment-final, faster rates. Swerts and Osten-
dorf (1995), however, report negative rate results.
In general, these studies have lacked an
independently-motivated notion of discourse struc-
ture. With few exceptions, they rely on intuitive
analyses of topic structure; operational definitions
of discourse-level properties (e.g., interpreting para-
graph breaks as discourse segment boundaries); or
&apos;theory-neutral&apos; discourse segmentations, where sub-
jects are given instructions to simply mark changes
in topic. Recent studies have focused on the ques-
tion of whether discourse structure itself can be em-
pirically determined in a reliable manner, a pre-
requisite to investigating linguistic cues to its exis-
tence. An intention-based theory of discourse was
used in (Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Grosz and
Hirschberg, 1992) to identify intonational correlates
of discourse structure in news stories read by a
professional speaker. Discourse structural elements
were determined by experts in the Grosz and Sidner
(1986) theory of discourse structure, based on either
text alone or text and speech. This study revealed
strong correlations of aspects of pitch range, ampli-
tude, and timing with features of global and local
structure for both segmentation methods. Passon-
neau and Litman (to appear) analyzed correlations
of pause, as well as cue phrases and referential re-
lations, with discourse structure; their segmenters
were asked to identify speakers&apos; communicative &amp;quot;ac-
tions&amp;quot;. The present study addresses issues of speak-
ing style and segmentation method while exploring
in more detail than previous studies the prosodic pa-
rameters that characterize initial, medial, and final
utterances in a discourse segment.

The current investigation of discourse and intonation
is based on analysis of a corpus of spontaneous and
read speech, the Boston Directions Corpus.&apos; This
&apos;The Boston Directions Corpus was designed and col-
lected in collaboration with Barbara Grosz.
corpus comprises elicited monologues produced by
multiple non-professional speakers, who were given
written instructions to perform a series of nine in-
creasingly complex direction-giving tasks. Speakers
first explained simple routes such as getting from one
station to another on the subway, and progressed
gradually to the most complex task of planning a
round-trip journey from Harvard Square to several
Boston tourist sights. Thus, the tasks were de-
signed to require increasing levels of planning com-
plexity. The speakers were provided with various
maps, and could write notes to themselves as well as
trace routes on the maps. For the duration of the
experiment, the speakers were in face-to-face con-
tact with a silent partner (a confederate) who traced
on her map the routes described by the speakers.
The speech was subsequently orthographically tran-
scribed, with false starts and other speech errors re-
paired or omitted; subjects returned several weeks
after their first recording to read aloud from tran-
scriptions of their own directions.

3.2 Acoustic-Prosodic Analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.99998265">
For this paper, the spontaneous and read recordings
for one male speaker were acoustically analyzed; fun-
damental frequency and energy were calculated us-
ing Entropic speech analysis software. The prosodic
transcription, a more abstract representation of the
intonational prominences, phrasing, and melodic
contours, was obtained by hand-labeling. We em-
ployed the ToBI standard for prosodic transcription
(Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg, 1994), which
is based upon Pierrehumbert&apos;s theory of Ameri-
can English intonation (Pierrehumbert, 1980). The
ToBI transcription provided us with a breakdown
of the speech sample into minor or INTERMEDIATE
PHRASES (Pierrehumbert, 1980; Beckman and Pier-
rehumbert, 1986). This level of prosodic phrase
served as our primary unit of analysis for measur-
ing both speech and discourse properties. The por-
tion of the corpus we report on consists of 494 and
552 intermediate phrases for read and spontaneous
speech, respectively.

3.3 Discourse Segmentation

<bodyText confidence="0.999894928571429">
In our research, the Grosz and Sidner (1986) the-
ory of discourse structure, hereafter G&amp;S, provides
a foundation for segmenting discourses into con-
stituent parts. According to this model, at least
three components of discourse structure must be dis-
tinguished. The utterances composing the discourse
divide into segments that may be embedded rela-
tive to one another. These segments and the em-
bedding relationships between them form the LIN-
GUISTIC STRUCTURE. The embedding relationships
reflect changes in the ATTENTIONAL STATE, the dy-
namic record of the entities and attributes that are
salient during a particular part of the discourse.
Changes in linguistic structure, and hence atten-

STRUCTURE; this structure comprises the intentions
or DISCOURSE SEGMENT PURPOSES (DSPs) under-
lying the discourse and relations between DSPs.
Two methods of discourse segmentation were em-
ployed by subjects who had expertise in the G&amp;S
theory. Following Hirschberg and Grosz (1992),
three subjects labeled from text alone (group T) and
three labeled from text and speech (group S). Other
than this difference in input modality, all subjects
received identical written instructions. The text for
each task was presented with line breaks correspond-
ing to intermediate phrase boundaries (i.e., ToBI
BREAK INDICES of level 3 or higher (Pitrelli, Beck-
man, and Hirschberg, 1994)). In the instructions,
subjects were essentially asked to analyze the lin-
guistic and intentional structures by segmenting the
discourse, identifying the DSPs, and specifying the
hierarchical relationships among segments.

Note that group T and group S segmentations
differ significantly, in contrast to earlier findings of
Hirschberg and Grosz (1992) on a corpus of read-
aloud news stories and in support of informal find-
ings of Swerts (1995). Table 1 shows that group
S produced significantly more consensus boundaries

employed.

are pooled, group S agreed upon significantly more
SBEG boundaries (p&lt;.05, x=4.7, df=1) as well as
SF boundaries (p&lt;.05, x=4.4, df=1) than did group
T. Further, it is not the case that text-alone seg-
menters simply chose to place fewer boundaries in
the discourse; if this were so, then we would expect
a high percentage of SCONT consensus labels where
no SBEGs or SFs were identified. Instead, we find
that the number of consensus SCONTs was signifi-
cantly higher for text-and-speech labelings than for
text-alone (p&lt;.001, x=49.1, df=1). It appears that
the speech signal can help disambiguate among al-
ternate segmentations of the same text. Finally, the
data in Table 1 show that spontaneous speech can be
segmented as reliably as its read counterpart, con-
trary to Ayer&apos;s results (1992).

4.1.2 Inter-labeler Reliability
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937">
Comparisons of inter-labeler reliability, that is,
the reproducibility of a coding scheme given multiple
labelers, provide another perspective on the segmen-
tation data. How best to measure inter-labeler re-
liability for discourse segmentation tasks, especially
for hierarchical segmentation, is an open research
question (Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Car-
letta, 1995; Flammia and Zue, 1995; Rotondo, 1984;
Swerts, 1995). For comparative purposes, we ex-
plored several measures proposed in the literature,
namely, COCHRAN&apos;S Q and the KAPPA (K) COEF-
FICIENT (Siegel and Castellan, 1988). Cochran&apos;s Q,
originally proposed in (Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992)
to measure the likelihood that similarity among la-
belings was due to chance, was not useful in the cur-
rent study; all tests of similarity using this metric
(pairwise, or comparing all labelers) gave probabil-
ity near zero. We concluded that this statistic did
not serve, for example, to capture the differences
observed between labelings from text alone versus
labelings from text and speech.
Recent discourse annotation studies (Isard and
Carletta, 1995; Flammia and Zue, 1995) have mea-
sured reliability using the K coefficient, which factors
out chance agreement taking the expected distribu-
tion of categories into account. This coefficient is
defined as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994510666666667">
PO PE
K =
1 E
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967909090909">
where Po represents the observed agreement and
PE represents the expected agreement. Typically,
values of .7 or higher for this measure provide ev-
idence of good reliability, while values of .8 or
greater indicate high reliability. Isard and Car-
letta (1995) report pairwise K scores ranging from
.43 to .68 in a study of naive and expert classifi-
cations of types of &apos;moves&apos; in the Map Task dia-
logues. For theory-neutral discourse segmentations
of information-seeking dialogues, Flammia (Flam-
mia and Zue, 1995) reports an average pairwise K

<bodyText confidence="0.990733052631579">
of .45 for five labelers and of .68 for the three most
similar labelers.
An important issue in applying the 1£ coefficient
is how one calculates the expected agreement us-
ing prior distributions of categories. We first calcu-
lated the prior probabilities for our data based sim-
ply on the distribution of SBEG versus non-SBEG
labels for all labelers on one of the nine direction-
giving tasks in this study, with separate calculations
for the read and spontaneous versions. This task,
which represented about 8% of the data for both
speaking styles, was chosen because it was midway
in planning complexity and in length among all the
tasks. Using these distributions, we calculated tz co-
efficients for each pair of labelers in each condition
for the remaining eight tasks in our corpus. The
observed percentage of SBEG labels, prior distribu-
tion for SBEG, average of the pairwise n scores, and
standard deviations for those scores are presented in

The average K scores for group T segmenters indi-
cate weak inter-labeler reliability. In contrast, aver-
age i scores for group S are .8 or better, indicating
a high degree of inter-labeler reliability. Thus, ap-
plication of this somewhat stricter reliability metric
confirms that the availability of speech critically in-
fluences how listeners perceive discourse structure.
The calculation of reliability for SBEG versus non-
SBEG labeling in effect tests the similarity of lin-
earized segmentations and does not speak to the is-
sue of how similar the labelings are in terms of hier-
archical structure. Flammia has proposed a method
for generalizing the use of the K coefficient for hi-
erarchical segmentation that gives an upper-bound
estimate on inter-labeler agreement.5 We applied
this metric to our segmentation data, calculating
weighted averages for pairwise n scores averaged for
each task. Results for each condition, together with
the lowest and highest average n scores over the
tasks, are presented in Table 3.

4.2 Intonational Features of Segments
4.2.1 Phrase Classes and Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998062">
For purposes of intonational analysis, we take
advantage of the high degree of agreement among
our discourse labelers and include in each seg-
ment boundary class (SBEG, SF, and SCONT) only
the phrases whose classification all subjects agreed
upon. We term these the CONSENSUS-LABELED
PHRASES, and compare their features to those of all
phrases not in the relevant class (i.e., non-consensus-
labeled phrases and consensus-labeled phrases of the
other types). Note that there were one-third fewer
consensus-labeled phrases for text-alone labelings
than for text-and-speech (see Table 1). We exam-
ined the following acoustic and prosodic features of
SBEG, SCONT, and SF consensus-labeled phrases:
f0 maximum and f0 average;6 rms (energy) max-
imum and rms average; speaking rate (measured
in syllables per second); and duration of preced-
ing and subsequent silent pauses. As for the seg-
mentation analyses, we compared intonational cor-
relates of segment boundary types not only for group
S versus group T, but also for spontaneous versus
read speech. While correlates have been identified
in read speech, they have been observed in sponta-
neous speech only rarely and descriptively.
&apos;We calculated 10 maximum in two ways: as simple f0
peak within the intermediate phrase and also as f0 max-
imum measured at the rms maximum of the sonorant
portion of the nuclear-accented syllable in the interme-
diate phrase (HIGH FO in the ToBI framework (Pitre
Beckman, and Hirschberg, 1994)). The latter measure
proved more robust, so we report results based on this
metric. The same applies to measurement of rms maxi-
mum. Average f0 and rms were calculated over the entire
intermediate phrase.

We found strong correlations for consensus SBEG,
SCONT, and SF phrases for all conditions. Results
for group T are given in Table 4, and for group S, in
Table 5.7
Consensus SBEG phrases in all conditions pos-
sess significantly higher maximum and average fO,
higher maximum and average rms, shorter subse-
quent pause, and longer preceding pause. For con-
sensus SCONT phrases, we found some differences
between read and spontaneous speech for both la-
beling methods. Features for group T included sig-
nificantly lower f0 maximum and average and lower
rms maximum and average for read speech, but only
lower f0 maximum for the spontaneous condition.
Group S features for SCONT were identical to group
T except for the absence of a correlation for maxi-
mum rms. While SCONT phrases for both speak-
ing styles exhibited significantly shorter preceding
and subsequent pauses than other phrases, only the
spontaneous condition showed a significantly slower
rate. For consensus SF phrases, we again found simi-

reported are significant at the .005 level or better, except

While it may appear somewhat surprising that
results for both labeling methods match so closely,
in fact, correlations for text-and-speech labels pre-
sented in Table 5 were almost invariably statistically
stronger than those for text-alone labels presented
in Table 4. These more robust results for text-and-
speech labelings occur even though the data set of
consensus labels is considerably larger than the data
set of consensus text-alone labelings.

With a view toward automatically segmenting a

SCONT and SF phrases exhibit similar prominence

whether such classification can be done con-line.&apos;
To address both of these issues, we made pairwise

labeled categories. Second, while SCONT and SF
appear to share prominence features in Table 5, Ta-
ble 6 reveals differences between SCONT and SF in
amount of f0 and db change. Thus, in addition to
lending themselves to on-line processing, local mea-
sures may also capture valuable prominence cues to
distinguish between segment-medial and segment-
final phrases.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992274375">
Although this paper reports results from only a sin-
gle speaker, the findings are promising. We have
demonstrated that a theory-based method for dis-
course analysis can provide reliable segmentations of
spontaneous as well as read speech. In addition, the
availability of speech in the text-and-speech labeling
method led to significantly higher reliability scores.
The stronger correlations found for intonational fea-
tures of the text-and-speech labelings suggest not
only that discourse labelers make use of prosody in
their analyses, but also that obtaining such data can
lead to more robust modeling of the relationship be-
tween intonation and discourse structure.
The following preliminary results can be con-
sidered for incorporation in such a model. First,
segment-initial utterances differ from medial and fi-

ings; results for text-alone were quite similar. Note that
&apos;increase&apos; means that there is a significantly greater in-
crease in 10, rms, or rate from prior to current phrase for
category 1 than for category 2 of the comparison, and
&apos;decrease&apos; means that there is a significantly greater de-
crease. T-tests again were one-tailed unless marked by

marked by &amp;quot;, which were at .01 or better.

nal utterances in both prominence and rhythmic
properties. Segment-medial and segment-final ut-
terances are distinguished more clearly by rhythmic
features, primarily pause. Finally, all correlations
found for global parameters can also be computed
based on relative change in acoustic-prosodic param-
eters in a window of two phrases.
Ongoing research is addressing the development
of automatic classification algorithms for discourse
boundary type; the role of prosody in conveying hier-
archical relationships among discourse segments; in-
dividual speaker differences; and discourse segmen-
tation methods that can be used by naive subjects.

Finally, the data in Table 1 show that spontaneous speech can be segmented as reliably as its read counterpart, contrary to Ayer&apos;s results (1992). 4.1.2 Inter-labeler Reliability Comparisons of inter-labeler reliability, that is, the reproducibility of a coding scheme given multiple labelers, provide another perspective on the segmentation data. How best to measure inter-labeler reliability for discourse segmentation tasks, especially for hierarchical segmentation, is an open research question (Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Carletta, 1995; Flammia and Zue, 1995; Rotondo, 1984; Swerts, 1995). For comparative purposes, we explored several measures proposed in the literature, namely, COCHRAN&apos;S Q and the KAPPA (K) COEFFICIENT (Siegel and Castellan, 1988). Cochran&apos;s Q, originally proposed in (Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) to measure the likelihood that similarity among labelings was due to chance, was not useful in the current study; all tests of similarity using this metric (pairwise, or comparing all labelers) gave probability near zero. We concluded that this statistic did not serve, for example, to capture the differences observed between labelings fro</context>

This coefficient is defined as PO PE K = 1 E where Po represents the observed agreement and PE represents the expected agreement. Typically, values of .7 or higher for this measure provide evidence of good reliability, while values of .8 or greater indicate high reliability. Isard and Carletta (1995) report pairwise K scores ranging from .43 to .68 in a study of naive and expert classifications of types of &apos;moves&apos; in the Map Task dialogues. For theory-neutral discourse segmentations of information-seeking dialogues, Flammia (Flammia and Zue, 1995) reports an average pairwise K 288 of .45 for five labelers and of .68 for the three most similar labelers. An important issue in applying the 1£ coefficient is how one calculates the expected agreement using prior distributions of categories. We first calculated the prior probabilities for our data based simply on the distribution of SBEG versus non-SBEG labels for all labelers on one of the nine directiongiving tasks in this study, with separate calculations for the read and spontaneous versions. This task, which represented about 8% of the data for both speaking styles, was chosen because i</context>

The ToBI transcription provided us with a breakdown of the speech sample into minor or INTERMEDIATE PHRASES (Pierrehumbert, 1980; Beckman and Pierrehumbert, 1986). This level of prosodic phrase served as our primary unit of analysis for measuring both speech and discourse properties. The portion of the corpus we report on consists of 494 and 552 intermediate phrases for read and spontaneous speech, respectively. 3.3 Discourse Segmentation In our research, the Grosz and Sidner (1986) theory of discourse structure, hereafter G&amp;S, provides a foundation for segmenting discourses into constituent parts. According to this model, at least three components of discourse structure must be distinguished. The utterances composing the discourse divide into segments that may be embedded relative to one another. These segments and the embedding relationships between them form the LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE. The embedding relationships reflect changes in the ATTENTIONAL STATE, the dynamic record of the entities and attributes that are salient during a particular part of the discourse. Changes</context>

Two methods of discourse segmentation were employed by subjects who had expertise in the G&amp;S theory. Following Hirschberg and Grosz (1992), three subjects labeled from text alone (group T) and three labeled from text and speech (group S). Other than this difference in input modality, all subjects received identical written instructions. The text for each task was presented with line breaks corresponding to intermediate phrase boundaries (i.e., ToBI BREAK INDICES of level 3 or higher (Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg, 1994)). In the instructions, subjects were essentially asked to analyze the linguistic and intentional structures by segmenting the discourse, identifying the DSPs, and specifying the hierarchical relationships among segments. 4 Results 4.1 Discourse Segmentation 4.1.1 Raw Agreement Labels on which all labelers in the group agreed are termed the CONSENSUS LABELS.3 The consensus labels for segment-initial (SBEG), segment-final (SF), and segment-medial (SCONT, defined as neither SBEG nor SF) phrase labels are given in Table 1.4 Table 1: Percentage of Consensus Labels by Segment Boundary Type SBEG SF</context>

Amplitude was also found to increase at the start of a new topic and decrease at the end (Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy, 1980). Swerts and colleagues (1992) found that melody and duration can pre-signal the end of a discourse unit, in addition to marking the discourse-unit-final utterance itself. And speaking rate has been found to correlate with structural variation; in several studies (Lehiste, 1980; Brubaker, 1972; Butterworth, 1975) segment-initial utterances exhibited slower rates, and segment-final, faster rates. Swerts and Ostendorf (1995), however, report negative rate results. In general, these studies have lacked an independently-motivated notion of discourse structure. With few exceptions, they rely on intuitive analyses of topic structure; operational definitions of discourse-level properties (e.g., interpreting paragraph breaks as discourse segment boundaries); or &apos;theory-neutral&apos; discourse segmentations, where subjects are given instructions to simply mark changes in topic.
