This small, well-written book tackles one of the great challenges facing automatic
speech recognition systems: handling &amp;quot;variation in pronunciation, associated with the
recognition of ordinary speech&amp;quot; (p. vii). The authors present the results of their work
on variation in American English and, more importantly, describe a methodology for
future work in that field.
In an effort to &amp;quot;combine desirable properties from each approach&amp;quot; (p. vii and p. 2),
the authors create an interesting blend of linguistic, computer science, and statistical
techniques overlaid with good empirical scientific method. The result is a dictionary
of phonological baseforms and computer models designed to demonstrate
that it is possible to model differences in pronunciation using a good
set of contextual descriptors without relying on hand-created rule or-
dering schemes. (p. 2)

Most of the chapters are introduced by a citation designed to orient the reader to the
topics in the chapter and at or near the start of each chapter, the authors state its
purpose(s). Most chapters conclude with chapter summaries.
Chapters 1 and 2 set the stage for the detailed description of the authors&apos; work pre-
sented in Chapters 3 through 5. Chapter 1 includes literature reviews for rule ordering,
contextual variation, and approaches to the selection of units to represent variation.
Chapter 2 describes traditional linguistic methodology and examines problems related
to reliance on hand-ordering of rules. The human informants of linguistic research are
replaced with an on-line lexical database, TIMIT, which is described in terms of its
usefulness for research on phonetic variation.
Chapters 3 through 5 describe the authors&apos; computational models in detail, ac-
companied by numerous examples. Chapter 3 focuses on rule creation, ordering, and
interaction; Chapter 4 describes vocabulary coverage and their handling of confus-
able words. (Detailed data are presented in appendices found at the end of the book.)
Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 1
Chapter 5 describes how they integrate statistical information and computational tools,
such as decision trees, with the other components of their system.
In contrast to much of the current work being done in automatic speech recog-
nition, the unit of representation in the authors&apos; system is the phoneme rather than
the triphone. Their dictionary &amp;quot;baseform&amp;quot; representations are &amp;quot;coarse&amp;quot; phonetic rep-
resentations that are converted to pronunciation variants through the application of
unordered rules. The contextual descriptors required to model phonetic variation are
divided into two classes: sound structure and composition (e.g., location of the pho-
netic element in the linguistic structure); and lexical category (e.g., function/content
word). Variants are derived from baseforms using recursive application of a single set
of unordered rules implemented as a finite-state grammar. Those rules contain contex-
tual, derivational, process control, and probabilistic information. The derived forms
are organized into a probabilistic pronunciation network.
In Chapter 6 the authors highlight the major achievements of the work described
in this book:

The self-described accomplishments listed above are not off the mark. The authors do
an excellent job of demonstrating how intelligent combination of linguistic, computa-
tional, and statistical tools can advance speech processing technology. The descriptive
elements (e.g., phones, contextual descriptors) come largely from linguistics, and the
procedural components are primarily computational (e.g., decision trees, finite-state
grammars) and statistical.
Their handling of rule ordering represents one of the most interesting examples of
this melding of approaches. The authors begin their work by using empirical testing
to assess the results of all possible orderings of the rules extracted from the TIMIT
data. Finding that
rule environments and memory-efficient algorithms count for more
than rule ordering schemes, (p. 39)
the authors elect to encode obligatory rule information directly into their dictionary
baseforms and optional rules into a finite-state machine. Rules are applied using a
recursive process called &amp;quot;machine iteration,&amp;quot; which entails feeding the output of the
finite-state machine back into itself until no new forms are produced. Machine itera-
tion is constrained by augmenting the rules with additional contextual information,
restrictions on the number of times some rules can apply, and probabilities. Finally,
experiments were designed to test the resulting system.
The writing is clear, well-organized, and pedagogically motivated. The reader is
shown the reasoning underlying the authors&apos; theoretical and implementation deci-
sions. System descriptions are accompanied by a large number of examples.
The authors accurately claim that their audience includes &amp;quot;speech engineers, lin-
guists, and anyone who wishes to understand symbolic systems and communication&amp;quot;
(p. vii). Technical linguistic terminology is clearly defined for nonlinguists, and com-
putational tools, such as on-line lexical databases and decision trees, are described

in detail. Their explanation of linguistic methodology and the descriptions of their
own methodology foster better cross-disciplinary understanding. As a result, this book
would be useful as a supplementary text for graduate-level courses in phonetics, com-
putational linguistics, and speech processing.
Some of the findings described in the book refer to isolated word recognition, and
it is not clear that they can automatically be applied to continuous speech despite
the authors&apos; stated concern with &amp;quot;fluent speech.&amp;quot; Even so, this work is an interesting
addition to the literature of computational linguistics.
