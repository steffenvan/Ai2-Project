This volume contains papers describing the CoNLL-2015 Shared Task and the participating systems.
This year, we continue the tradition of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning
(CoNLL) of having a high profile shared task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on
Shallow Discourse Parsing, which involves identifying individual discourse relations that are present
in a natural language text. A discourse relation can be expressed explicitly or implicitly, and takes two
arguments realized as sentences, clauses, or in some rare cases, phrases. Shallow Discourse Parsing is
a fundamental NLP task and can potentially benefit a range of natural language applications such as
Information Extraction, Text Summarization, Question Answering, Machine Translation, and Sentiment
Analysis.
A total of sixteen teams from three continents participated in this task, and fourteen of them submitted
system description papers. Many different approaches were adopted by the participants, and we hope
that these approaches help to advance the state of the art in Shallow Discourse Parsing. The training,
development, and test sets were adapted from the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB). In addition, we
also annotated a blind test set following the PDTB guidelines solely for the shared task. The results on
the blind test set were used to rank the participating systems. The evaluation scorer, also developed for
this shared task, adopts an F1 based metric that takes into account the accuracy of identifying the senses
and arguments of discourse relations as well as explicit discourse connectives. We hope that the data
sets and the scorer, which are freely available upon the completion of the shared task, will be a useful
resource for researchers interested in discourse parsing.
For the first time in the history of the CoNLL shared tasks, participating teams, instead of running their
systems on the test set and submitting the output, were asked to deploy their systems on a remote virtual
machine and use a web-based evaluation platform to run their systems on the test set. This meant they
were unable to actually see the data set, thus preserving its integrity and ensuring its replicability. We
hope that the successful implementation of this new evaluation protocol in the shared task will encourage
its adoption in future NLP evaluation campaigns.
