Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999940892857143">
These proceedings contain the papers and invited talks presented at the Workshop on Negation and
Speculation in Natural Language Processing (NeSp-NLP 2010) that was held on the 10th of July, 2010
in Uppsala, Sweden. The program consisted of five invited talks, seven presentations of long papers
and two of short papers.
When we thought of organising this workshop, we aimed at bringing together researchers working on
negation and speculation from any area related to computational language learning and processing.
Specific goals were to describe the lexical aspects of negation and speculation, to define how the
semantics of these phenomena can be modelled for computational purposes, to explore techniques
aimed at learning the factuality of an statement, and to analyse how the treatment of these phenomena
affects the efficiency of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
Negation and speculation are two linguistic phenomena involved in deep understanding of text. They are
resources used to express the factuality of statements, which indicates to which extent a statement is or
is not a fact. Negation turns an affirmative statement into negative (it rains/it does not rain). Speculation
is used to express levels of certainty (it might rain/apparently, it will rain/ it is likely to rain/it is not clear
whether it will rain/we suspect that it will rain). We knew that negation and speculation (or modality)
have been extensively studied from a theoretical perspective. Furthermore, we also believed that there
was enough interest on these topics among the NLP community and that there was enough research
going on, so as to organise a topical workshop, the first of its kind as far as we know.
We cannot be exhaustive here about all the NLP related work on these topics that has been published
before the workshop. We apologise for mentioning only some references as examples of research that
is being carried out, which motivated our decision of organising a workshop. As recent references, the
BioScope corpus has been annotated with negation and speculation cues and their scope (Vincze et al.
2009); events in the FactBank corpus (Saur´ı and Pustejovsky 2009) have been annotated with factuality
information; the CoNLL Shared Task 2010 (Farkas et al. 2010) focused on Learning to detect hedges
and their scope in natural language text. The biomedical text mining community has produced tools
to process negation, like Context (Harkema et al. 2009), and negation has also received attention from
researchers working on sentiment analysis (Wilson et al. 2009 and work cited in Wiegand et al. 2010).
We proposed the following topics in the call for papers of the workshop:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997349823529412">
• Lexical aspects of negation and speculation
• Linguistic resources with information about negation and speculation: corpora, dictionaries,
lexical databases
• Descriptive analysis of negation and speculation cues
• Negation and speculation across domains and genres
• Negation and speculation in biomedical texts and biomedical text mining
• Handling negation and speculation in NLP: dialogue systems, sentiment analysis, text mining,
textual entailment, information extraction, machine translation, paraphrasing
v
• Learning the scope of negation and speculation cues
• Interaction of negation and speculation for evaluating the factuality of an statement
• Corpora annotation: guidelines, bootstrapping techniques, quality assessment
• Modelling factuality for computational purposes
• Algorithms to learn negation and speculation
• Structured prediction of negation and speculation
• Joint learning of negation and speculation
• Inference of factual knowledge
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998637037037">
Although we did not receive submissions addressing all the proposed topics, the fact that we received
submissions addressing some of them makes us consider that the main goal of the workshop was
achieved, and that there is a growing interest in processing negation and speculation within several
NLP subareas. From the nine accepted papers, six report research on biomedical texts, four of which
are related to either manual or automatic annotation of corpora, one to automatically identifying
negated biomedical events, and one to evaluating whether identifying negation and speculation helps
in classifying medical reports. Two papers deal with negation in sentiment analysis, one focuses on
automatically learning the scope and another surveys the role of negation in sentiment analysis. One
paper reports research on the relation between positive and negative pairs in textual entailment.
Four of the five invited presentations are from the biomedical domain. Maria Liakata presents an
annotation scheme for annotating full papers with zones of conceptualisation levels to identify the core
components that constitute a scientic investigation. Veronika Vincze presents the difculties encountered
during annotation process of the BioScope corpus. Martin Krallinger elaborates on the importance of
negations and experimental qualifiers to extract information from biomedical literature, and Raheel
Nawaz, Paul Thompson, and Sophia Ananiadou discuss the evaluation of a meta-knowledge annotation
scheme for bio-events. Finally, Ed Hovy, invites us to consider Distributional Semantics as a model for
richer and more semantics-oriented statistics-based NLP. He presents a specic model of Distributional
Semantics, and explores the possibilities for accommodating the phenomena of negation and modality.
We would like to thank the authors of the papers for their interesting contributions, the members of
the program committee for their insightful reviews, and the presenters of invited talks for accepting the
invitation to give a talk at the workshop and share their work. We are grateful to Walter Daelemans for
encouraging us to organise the workshop. The workshop would not have been possible without their
help. We appreciate very much the knowledge, time, and effort that they invested in the workshop. We
are also thankful to the University of Antwerp and Saarland University for their institutional support and
to the SIGs that endorsed the workshop. We sincerely hope that in the future the NLP community will
benefit from the findings made by researchers working on negation, speculation and other phenomena
involved in determining the factuality of an event.
