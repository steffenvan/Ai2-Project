Rigorous interpretation of pronouns is possible
when syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of a dis-
course can be reasonably controlled. Interaction
with a database provides such an environment. In
the framework of the User Specialty Languiges
system and Discourse Representation Theory, we
formulate strict and preferential rules for pronomi-
nalization and outline a procedure to find proper
assignments of referents to pronouns.

One of the main obstacles of the automated process-
ing of natural language sentences (and a forteriori
texts) is the proper treatment of anaphoric re-
lations. Even though there is a plethora of re-
search attempting to specify (both on the
theoretical level as well as in connection with im-
plementations) &amp;quot;strategies&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;pronoun
resolution&amp;quot;, it is fair to say
a) that no uniform and comprehensive treatment of
anaphora has yet been attained
b) that surprisingly little effort has been spent in
applying the results of research in linguistics
and formal semantics in actual implemented sys-
tems.
A quick glance at Hirst (1981) will confirm that
there is a large gap between the kinds of theore-
tical issues and puzzling cases that have been con-
sidered on the one hand in the setting of
computational linguistics and on the other in recent
semantically oriented approaches to the formal
analysis of natural languages.
One of the main aims of this paper is to bridge
this gap by combining recent efforts forthcoming in
formal semantics (based on Montague grammar and
Discourse Representation Theory) with existing
and relatively comprehensive grammars of German
and English constructed in connection with the Us-
er Specialty Languages (USL) system, a natural
language database query system briefly described
below.
We have drawn extensively -- as far as
insights, examples, puzzles and adequacy condi-
tions are concerned -- on the various &amp;quot;variable
binding&amp;quot; approaches to pronouns (e.g. work in the
Montague tradition, the illuminating discussion by
Evans (1980) and Webber (1978), as well as recent
transformational accounts). Our approach has
however been most deeply influenced by those who
have (like Smaby (1979), (1981) and Kamp (1981))
advocated dispensing with pronoun indexing on the
one hand and by those (like Chastain (1973),
Evans (1980), and Kamp (1981)) who have empha-
sized the &amp;quot;referential&amp;quot; function of certain uses of
indefinite noun phrases.
2 Background
Contrary to what is assumed in most theories of
pronominalization (namely that the most propitious
way of dealing with pronouns is to consider them as
a kind of indexed variable), we agree with Kamp
(1981) and Smaby (1979) in treating pronouns as
bona fide lexical elements at the level of syntactic
representation.
Treatments of anaphora have taken place within
two quite distinct settings, so it seems. On the
one hand, linguists have primarily been concerned
with the specification of mainly syntactic criteria in
determining the proper &amp;quot;binding&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;disjointness&amp;quot; criteria (cf. below), whereas compu-
tational linguists have in general paid more
attention to anaphoric relations in texts, where se-
mantic and pragmatic features play a much greater
role. In trying to relate the two approaches one
should be aware that in the absence of any serious
theory of text understanding, any attempt to deal
with anaphora in unrestricted domains (even if
they are simple enough as for instance children&apos;s
stories), will encounter so many diverse problems
which, even when they influence anaphoric re-
lations, are completely beyond the scope of a
systematic treatment at the present moment. We
have thought it to be important therefore to impose
some constraints right from the start on the type of
discourse with respect to which our treatment of
anaphora is to be validated (or falsified). Of
course, what we are going to say should in princi-
ple be extendible to more complex types of
discourse in the future.
The context of the present inquiry is the query-
ing of relational databases (as opposed to say gen-
eral discourse analysis). The type of discourse we
are interested in are thus dialogues in the setting
of a relational database (which may be said to rep-
resent both the context of queries and answers as
well as the &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;). It should be clear that a
wide variety of anaphoric expressions is available
in this kind of interaction; on the other hand, the
relevant knowledge we assume in resolving pronom-
inal relations must come from the information

<bodyText confidence="0.999946625">
specified in the database (in the relations, in the
various dependencies and integrity constraints)
and in the rules governing the language.
We are making the following assumptions for da-
tabase querying. A query dialogue is a sequence
of pairs &lt;query,answer&gt;. For the sake of simplici-
ty we assume that the possible answers are of the
form

- yes/no answer

ders Spain?&amp;quot;)

2.1 The User Specialty Languages system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999739590909091">
The USL system (Lehmann (1978), Ott and Zoep-
pritz (1979), Lehmann (1980)) provides an inter-
face to a relational data base management system
for data entry, query, and manipulation via re-
stricted natural language. The USL System trans-
lates input queries expressed in a natural language
(currently German (Zoeppritz (1983), English, and
Spanish (Sopena (1982))) into expressions in the
SQL query language, and evaluates those ex-
pressions through the use of System R (Astrahan
&amp;al (1976)). The prototype built has been vali-
dated with real applications and thus shown its
usability. The system consists of (1) a language
processing component (ULG), (2) grammars for
German, English, and Spanish, (3) a set of 75 in-
terpretation routines, (4) a code generator for
SQL, and (5) the data base management system
System R. USL runs under VM/CMS in a virtual
machine of 7 MBytes, working set size is 1.8
MBytes. ULG, interpretation routines, and code
generator comprise approximately 40,000 lines of
PL/I code.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.601701">
Syntactic analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998194711538461">
The syntax component of USL uses the User
Language Generator (ULG) which originates from
the Paris Scientific Center of IBM France and has
been described by Bertrand &amp;al (1976). ULG con-
sists of a parser, a semantic executer, the grammar
META, and META interpretation routines. META is
used to process the grammar of a language. ULG
accepts general phrase structure grammars written
in a modified Backus-Naur-Form. With any rule it
allows the specification of arbitrary, routines to
control its application or to perform arbitrary ac-
tions, and it allows sophisticated checking and
setting of syntactic features. Grammars for Ger-
man, English, and Spanish have been described in
a form accepted by ULG. The grammars provide
rules for those fragments of the languages relevant
for communicating with a database. The USL
grammars have been constructed in such a way that
constituents correspond as closely as possible to
semantic relationships in the sentence, and that
parsing is made as efficient as possible. Where a
true representation of the semantic relationships in
the parse tree could not be achieved, the burden
was put on the interpretation routines to remedy
the situation.
Interpretation
The approach to interpretation in the USL sys-
tem builds on the ideas of model theoretic
semantics. This implies that the meaning of struc-
ture words and syntactic constructions is inter-
preted systematically and independent of the
contents of a given database. Furthermore, since
a relational database can be regarded as a (partial)
model in the sense of model theory, the interpreta-
tion of natural language concepts in terms of
relations is quite natural. (A more detaiied dis-
cussion can be found in Lehmann (1978).)
In the USL system, extensions of concepts are
represented as virtual relations of a relational da-
tabase which are defined on physically stored re-
lations (base relations). The set of virtual
relations represents the conceptual knowledge
about the data and is directly linked to natural
language words and phrases. This approach has
the advantage that extensions of concepts can rela-
tively easily be related to objects of conventional
databases.
For illustration of the connection between virtu-
al relations and words, consider the following ex-
ample. Suppose that for a geographical application
someone has arranged the data in the form of the
relation
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.722662" genericHeader="method">
CO (COUNTRY,CAPITAL,AREA,POPULATION)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997484">
Now virtual relations such as the following which
correspond to concepts can be formed by simply
projecting out the appropriate columns of CO:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.511073" genericHeader="method">
CAPITAL (NOM_CAPITAL,OF_COUNTRY)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998922">
Standard role names (OF, NOM, ...) establish the
connection between syntactic constructions and co-
lumns of virtual relations and enable answering
questions such as

(1) What is Austria&apos;s capital?
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992143583333333">
in a straightforward and simple way. Standard
role names are surface oriented because this makes
it possible for a user not trained in linguistics to
define his own words and relations. (For a com-
plete list of standard role names see e.g. Zoeppritz
(1983).)
We are currently working on the integration of
the concepts underlying the USL system with Dis-
course Representation Theory which is described in
the next section. We have already implemented a
procedure which generates Discourse Represen-
tation Structures from USL&apos;s semantic trees and

2.2 Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999644956521739">
In this section we give a brief description of
Kamp&apos;s Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) in
as much as it relates to our concerns with pronomi-
nalization. For a more detailed discussion of this
theory and its general ramifications for natural
language processing, cf. the papers by Kamp
(1981) and Guenthner (1983a, 1983b).
According to DRT, each natural language sen-
tence (or discourse) is associated with a so-called
Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) on the
basis of a set of DRS formation rules. These rules
are sensitive to both the syntactic structure of the
sentences in question as well as to the DRS context
in which in the sentence occurs. In the formu-
lation of Kamp (1981) the latter is really of
importance only in connection with the proper anal-
ysis of pronouns. We feel on the other hand that
the DRS environment of a sentence to be processed
should determine much more than just the anaphor-
ic assignments. We shall discuss this issue - in
particular as it relates to problems of ambiguity
and vagueness - in more depth in a forthcoming
paper.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9393265">
A DRS K for a discourse has the general form
K = &lt;U, Con&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906">
where U is a set of &amp;quot;discourse referents&amp;quot; for K and
Con a set of &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot; on these individuals.
Conditions can be either atomic or complex. An
atomic condition has the form
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.584114666666667">
P(t1,...,tn)
or
tl=c
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.964243428571429">
where ti is a discourse referent and c a proper
name and P an n-place predicate.
The only complex condition we shall discuss
here is the one representing universally quantified
noun phrases or conditional sentences. Both are
treated in much the same way. Let us call these
implicational&amp;quot; conditions:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.641366">
K1 IMP K2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.990300885714286">
where K1 and K2 are also DRSs. With a discourse
D is thus associated a Discourse Representation
structure which represents D in a quantifier-free
&amp;quot;clausal&amp;quot; form, and which captures the proposi-
tional import of the discourse by - among other
things, establishing the correct pronominal con-
nections.
What is important for the treatment of anaphora
in the present context is the following:
a) Given a discourse with a principal DRS Ko and a
set of non-principal DRSs (or conditions) Ki among
its conditions all discourse referents of Ko are ad-
missible referents for pronouns in sentences or
(phrases) giving rise to the various embedded
Ki&apos;s. In particular, all occurrences of proper
names in a discourse will always be associated with
discourse referents of the principal DRS Ko. (This
is on the (admittedly unrealistic) assumption that
proper names refer uniquely.)
b) Given an implicational DRS of the form 1&lt;1 IMP
K2 occurring in a DRS K, a relation of relative ac-
cessibility between DRSs is defined as follows:
K1 is accessible from K2 and all K&apos; accessible
from K1 are also accessible from K2.
In particular, the principal DRS Ko is accessible
from its subordinate DRSs (for a precise definition
cf. Kamp (1981)). The import of this definition
for anaphora is simply that if a pronoun is being
resolved (i.e. interpreted) in the context of a DRS
K&apos; from which a set K of DRSs is accessible, then
the union of all the sets of discourse referents as-
sociated with every Ki in K is the set of admissible
candidates for the interpretation of the pronoun.
The following illustrations will make this clear:
K(Every country imports a product it needs)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9032355">
u2
import(ul,u2)
product(u2)
need(ul,u2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.954094">
This sentence (as well as its interrogative version)
allows only one interpretation of the pronoun it ac-
cording to DRT. It does not introduce any dis-
course referent available for pronominalization in
later sentences (or queries). But in a DRS like
the following, DRT does not - as it stands - ac-
count for pronoun resolution:
K(John tickled Bill. He squirmed)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.98729575">
ul u2
ul = John
u2 = Bill
tickled(ul,u2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.882561875">
At this point, the pronoun he has to be
interpreted. There are two admissible candidates,
ul and u2, but DRT does not choose between them.
So the DRS could be continued with either
squirm(u1)
or
squirm(u2)
Similarly, in the following DRS
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.609788">
ul
country(u1) IMP
</figure>
<page confidence="0.797466">
146
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.513938">
K(If Spain is a member of every organization,
it has a member)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.931118333333333">
u3
member( u3 , it)
member(u 1 ,u2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999798894736842">
the pronoun it could only refer to Spain (on con-
figurational grounds), and would have to be as-
signed that object if no other criteria are assumed.
Obviously, as far as this sentence and the intended
database is concerned, we should want to rule out
such an assignment. (This can be done via rule Si
discussed below.)
In general, then, given a sentence (or dis-
course) represented in a DRS there will be more
candidates for admissible pronoun assignments as
one should like to have available when a particular
pronoun is to be interpreted. The rules described
in Section 3 are meant to capture some of the regu-
larities that arise in typical database querying
interactions.
c) Finally, given a DRS for a discourse D we can
say that a pronoun is properly referential iff it is
represented by (i.e. eliminated in favor of) a dis-
course referent ui occurring in the domain of the
principal DRS representing D. (In the context of
the constructions illustrated so far, this will be
true in particular of proper names as well as of in-
definite noun phrases not in the scope of of a
universal noun phrase or a conditional.) .
The main problem then for the treatment of anapho-
ra is to determine which possible discourse refer-
ents should be chosen when we come to the
interpretation of a particular pronoun occurrence
pi in the formation of the extension of the DRS in
which we are working.
We would like to suggest the following strategy
as a starting point. Consider a query dialogue Q
with an already established DRS K and the utter-
ance of a query S, where S contains occurrences of
personal pronouns. Suppose further that A(S) is
the sole syntactic analysis available for S. Then
we regard the construction of the extension of the
DRS obtained on the basis of S and K as the value
of a partial function f defined on K and A(S).
More generally still, as Kamp himself suggests, we
can regard the &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; (or information content)
of a sentence to be that partial function from DRSs
to DRSs.
In a given dialogue both the queries and the an-
swers will have the side effect of introducing new
individuals and &amp;quot;preference&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;salience&amp;quot; or-
derings on these individuals, and we want to allow
for pronominal reference to these much in the same
way that in a text preceding sentences may have
determined a set of possible antecedents for pro-
nouns in the curren;ly processed sentence. The
DRS built up in the process of a querying session
will constitute the &amp;quot;mutual knowledge&amp;quot; available to
the user in specifying his further queries as well
as in his uses of pronouns. It is on the individuals
introduced in the DRSs that the rules to be dis-
cussed below are intended to operate.

3 Interplay of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in
pronominalization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882833333333">
The process of pronominalization is governed by
rules involving morphological, syntactic, semantic,
and pragmatic criteria. These rules are discussed
and illustrated with examples drawn from the con-
text of querying a geographical database. Then a
procedure is outlined which uses these rules and
applies them in the following order:
First morphological criteria are checked, if they
fail no further tests are required.
Then syntactic (or configurational) criteria are
tested. Again, if they fail, no further tests are
necessary.
Next semantic criteria are applied, and if they
do not fail,
the pragmatic criteria have to be tested. If
more than one candidate remains, the use of the
pronoun was pragmatically inappropriate and
must be noted as such.

Disjoint reference
The rule of &amp;quot;disjoint reference&amp;quot; according to
Reinhart (1983) goes back to Chomsky and has
been refined by Lasnik (1976) and Reinhart (1983).
It is able to handle a variety of well-known cases,
such as

<listItem confidence="0.9742616">

(In the starred example, the use of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is inappro-
priate, if it is to be coreferential with &amp;quot;Spain&amp;quot;.)
Rather than using c-command to formulate this
criterion, which is elegant but too strict in some
cases (as noted by Reinhart herself and Bolinger
(1979), we have chosen an admittedly less elegant,
but hopefully reliable, approach to disjoint refer-
ence, in that we specify the concrete syntactic
configurations where disjoint reference holds. We
do not rely here on the syntactic framework of USL
grammar, but use more or less traditionally known
terminology for expressing our rules. We need the
terms &amp;quot;clause&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;phrase&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;matrix&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;embedding&amp;quot;,
and &amp;quot;level&amp;quot;. These can be made explicit, when a
suitable syntactic framework is chosen.
Now we can formulate our disjoint reference rule
and some of its less obvious consequences.
Cl. The referent of a personal pronoun can never
be within the same clause at the same phrase level.
(Note that this rule does not hold for possessive
pronouns.)
Cl has a number of consequences which we now
list:
Cla. The (implicit) subject of an infinitve clause
can never be referent of a personal pronoun in that
clause

3.1.3 Semantic criteria
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98517928125">
Widely used is the criterion of semantic compatibili-
ty. It is usually implemented via &amp;quot;semantic fea-
tures&amp;quot;. In the USL framework we can derive this
information from relation schemata. We state the
criterion as follows:
Si. If s is a sentence containing a pronoun p and
c a full noun phrase in the context of p. If p is
substituted by c in s to yield s&apos; and s&apos; is not se-
mantically anomalous, i.e. does not imply a contra-
diction, then c is semantically compatible with s
and is hence a semantically possible candidate for
the reference of p.
(20) What is the capital of Austria? - Vienna. What
does it export?
If it is assumed that only countries but not capitals
export goods, then the only semantically possible
referent for &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is Austria.
S2. Non-referentially introduced nouns cannot be
antecedents of pronouns.
(21) Which countries does Italy have trade with?
How large is it?
Since &amp;quot;trade&amp;quot; is used non-referentially, it cannot
be antecedent of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;. Unfortunately, in many cas-
es where this criterion could apply, there is an
ambiguity between referential and non-referential
use.
Apart from the type of semantic compatibility
covered by rule Si, more complex semantic proper-
ties are used to determine the referent of a pro-
noun. The &amp;quot;task structures&amp;quot; described by Grosz
(1977) illustrate this fact. We hence formulate the
rule

For an illustration of its effect, consider the follow-
ing query:
(22) What country is its neighbor?
The irreflexivity of the neighbor-relation entails
that &amp;quot;its&amp;quot; cannot be bound by &amp;quot;what country&amp;quot; in
this case, but has to refer to something mentioned
in the previous context.
Given a subject domain, one can analyze the
properties of the relations and the relationships be-
tween them and so build a basis for deciding pro-
noun reference on semantic grounds. In the
framework of the USL system, information on the
properties of relations is available in terms of
&amp;quot;functional dependencies&amp;quot; given in the database
schema or as integrity constraints.

3.2 Pragmatic criteria
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982295">
The generation of discourse is controlled by two
factors: communicative intentions and mutual
knowledge. In the context of database interaction,
we can assume that the communicative intentions of
a user are simply to obtain factual answers to fac-
tual questions. His intentions are expressed either
by single queries or by sequences of queries, de-
pending on how complex these intentions are or
how closely they correspond to the information in
the database. As will be shown below, in many
cases the system will not have a chance to deter-
mine whether a given query is a &amp;quot;one-shot query&amp;quot;,
or whether it is part of a sequence of queries with
a common &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;. For the resolution of pronouns,
this means that the system should rather ask the
user back than make wild guesses on what might be
the most &amp;quot;plausible&amp;quot; referent. This is of course
not possible when running text is analyzed in a
&amp;quot;batch mode&amp;quot;, and no user is there to be asked for
clarification.
Mutual knowledge (see e.g. Clark and Marshall
(1981) for a discussion) determines the rules for
introducing and referencing individuals in the dis-
course. In the context of database interaction we
assume the mutual knowledge to consist initially of:
- the set of proper names in the database,
- the predicates whose extensions are in the data-
base,
- the &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; relationships between and
properties of these predicates.
It will be part of the design of a database to estab-
lish what these &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; relationships and
properties are,&apos; e.g. whether it is generally known
to the user community, whether &amp;quot;capital&amp;quot; expresses
a one-one relation. Each question-answer pair oc-
curring in the discourse is added to the stock of
mutual knowledge.
It is a pragmatic principle of pronominalization
that only mutual knowledge may be used to deter-
mine the referent of a pronoun on semantic
grounds, and hence it may be legal to use the same
sentence containing a pronoun where earlier in the

3.2.1 A first attempt using preference rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99429152">
What the topic of a discourse is, which of the enti-
ties mentioned in it are in focus, is reflected in the
syntactic structure of sentences. This has been
observed for a long time. It has also often been
observed that discourse topic and focus have an ef-
fect on pronominalization where morphological, con-
figurational, and semantic rules fail to determine a
single candidate for reference. However, it has
not been possible yet to formulate precise rules ex-
plaining this phenomenon. We have the impression
that such rules cannot be absolutely strict rules,
but are of a preferential nature. We have devel-
oped a set of such rules and tested them against a
corpus of text containing some 600 pronoun occur-
rences, and have found them to work remarkably
well. Similar tests (with a similar set of rules)
have been conducted by Hofmann (1976).
In the sequel we formulate and discuss our list
of rules. Their ordering corresponds to the order
in which they have to be applied.
P1 (principle of proximity). Noun phrases within
the sentence containing the pronoun are preferred
over noun phrases in previous or succeeding sen-
tences.
Consider the sequence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.807416666666667">
(23) What country joined the EC after 1980? -
Greece.
(24) What country consumes the wine it produces?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823761904762">
One could argue that &amp;quot;Greece&amp;quot; is just as probably
the intended referent of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in this case as the
bound interpretation and that hence the use of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;
should be rejected as inappropriate. However,
there is no way to avoid the &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;, if the bound var-
iable interpretation is intended, and one can use
this as a ground to rule out the interpretation whe-
re &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; refers to &amp;quot;Greece&amp;quot;.
Pla. Noun phrases in sentences before the sen-
tence containing the pronoun are preferred over
noun phrases in more distant sentences.
This criterion is very important to limit the search
for possible discourse referents.
P2. Pronouns are preferred over full noun
phrases.
This rule is found in many systems dealing with
anaphora. One can motivate it by saying that
pronominalization establishes an entity as a theme
which is then maintained until the chain of pro-
nouns is broken by a sentence not containing a sui-
table pronoun. For an example consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991911666666667">
(25) What is the area of Austria?
(26) What is its capital?
(27) What is its population?
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.998314">
149
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.942682">
P3. Noun phrases in a matrix clause or phrase are
preferred over noun phrases in embedded clauses
or phrases.
P3a. Noun phrases in a matrix clause are pre-
ferred over noun phrases in embedded clauses.
Example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.677316">
(28) What country imports a product that Spain
produces? - Denmark.
(29) What does it export?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.902640166666667">
Here &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; has to refer to the individual satisfying
&amp;quot;what country&amp;quot;, not to &amp;quot;Spain&amp;quot; which occurs in an
embedded clause.
P3b. Head nouns are preferred over noun comple-
ments.
Example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.614778">
(30) What is the capital of Austria? - Vienna.
(31) What is its population?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999542285714286">
&amp;quot;Vienna&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;Austria&amp;quot; becomes the referent of
&amp;quot;its&amp;quot;, and the argument is analogous to that for
P3a.
P4. Subject noun phrases are preferred over
non-subject noun phrases.
In declarative contexts, this rule works quite well.
It corresponds essentially to the focus rule of Sid-
ner (1981). In a question-answering situation it is
hardly applicable, since especially in wh-questions
subject position and word order, which both play a
role, tend to interfere. We therefore tend to not
use this rule, but rather to let the system ask back
in cases where it would apply. For illustration
consider the following examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.913704">
(32) Does Spain border Portugal? What is its popu-
lation?
(33) Is Spain bordered by Portugal? What is its
population?
(34) Which country borders Portugal? What is its
population?
(35) Which country does Portugal border? What is
its population?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9765952">
135. Accusative object noun phrases are preferred
over other non-subject noun phrases.
Pti. Noun phrases preceding the pronoun are pre-
ferred over noun phrases succeeding the pronoun
(or: anaphora is preferred over kataphora).

3.3 Outline of a pronoun resolution procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9665698125">
We now outline a procedure for &amp;quot;resolving&amp;quot; pro-
nouns in the framework of the USL system and
DRT.
Let M = &lt;U, Con&gt; be the DRS representing the
mutual knowledge, in particular the past discourse.
Let K(s) be the DRS representing the current sen-
tence s and let p be a pronoun occurring in s for
which an appropriate discourse referent has to be
found. Let Ua(p) be the set of discourse referents
accessible to p according to the accessibility re-
lation given in sec. 2.2
Let further c be a function that applies to U
a(P)
all the morphological, syntactic, and semantic cri-
teria given above and yields a set Uc(p) as result.
Now three cases have to be distinguished:

1. Uis empty. In this case the use of p was
inappropriate.
2. Card(Uc(p)) is 1. In this case a referent for p

Let p be a function that applies to Uc(p) if the
cardinality of Uc(p) is greater than 1 all the pref-
erence rules given above in the order indicated
there yielding the result U . Card(U ) can never
be 0, hence two cases are possible, either the car-
dinality is 1, then a referent has been uniquely
determined and the pronoun p can be eliminated in
K, or the cardinality is greater than 1, and then
the use of p was inappropriate.
It can be inferred from the formulation of the
pronominalization rules given above, what morpho-
logical and syntactic information has to be stored
with the discourse referents in the DRSs, and what
semantic information has to be accessible from the
schema of the database to enable the application of
the functions c and p. Hence, we will not spell out
these details here.

4 Open questions and conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999612761904762">
Many well-known and puzzling cases have not been
addressed here, among them plural anaphora,
so-called pronouns of laziness, one pronominaliza-
tion, to name just a few.
We have not said anything about phenomena
such as discourse topic, focus, or coherence and
their influence on anaphora. Their effects are cap-
tured in our preference rules to some degree, but
no one can precisely say how. Inspite of claims to
the contrary, we believe that much work is still re-
quired, before these notions can be used
effectively in natural language processing.
By limiting ourselves to the relatively
well-defined communicative situation of database in-
teraction, we have been able to state precisely,
what rules are applicable in the fragment of lan-
guage we are dealing with. We are currently work-
ing on the analysis of running texts, but again in a
well-delineated domain, and we hope to be able to
extend our theory on the basis of the experience
gained.

We are convinced that serious progress in the

<abstract confidence="0.998350851994854">of pronouns is possible when syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of a discourse can be reasonably controlled. Interaction with a database provides such an environment. In the framework of the User Specialty Languiges system and Discourse Representation Theory, we formulate strict and preferential rules for pronominalization and outline a procedure to find proper assignments of referents to pronouns. 1 Overview: Relation to previous work of the main obstacles of the processing of natural language sentences (and a forteriori texts) is the proper treatment of anaphoric relations. Even though there is a plethora of reattempting to (both on the level as well as in connection with implementations) &amp;quot;strategies&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;pronoun resolution&amp;quot;, it is fair to say a) that no uniform and comprehensive treatment of anaphora has yet been attained b) that surprisingly little effort has been spent in applying the results of research in linguistics and formal semantics in actual implemented systems. A quick glance at Hirst (1981) will confirm that there is a large gap between the kinds of theoretical issues and puzzling cases that have been considered on the one hand in the setting of computational linguistics and on the other in recent semantically oriented approaches to the formal analysis of natural languages. One of the main aims of this paper is to bridge this gap by combining recent efforts forthcoming in formal semantics (based on Montague grammar and Discourse Representation Theory) with existing and relatively comprehensive grammars of German and English constructed in connection with the User Specialty Languages (USL) system, a natural language database query system briefly described below. We have drawn extensively -as far as insights, examples, puzzles and adequacy conditions are concerned -on the various &amp;quot;variable binding&amp;quot; approaches to pronouns (e.g. work in the Montague tradition, the illuminating discussion by Evans (1980) and Webber (1978), as well as recent transformational accounts). Our approach has however been most deeply influenced by those who have (like Smaby (1979), (1981) and Kamp (1981)) advocated dispensing with pronoun indexing on the one hand and by those (like Chastain (1973), Evans (1980), and Kamp (1981)) who have emphasized the &amp;quot;referential&amp;quot; function of certain uses of indefinite noun phrases. 2 Background Contrary to what is assumed in most theories of pronominalization (namely that the most propitious way of dealing with pronouns is to consider them as a kind of indexed variable), we agree with Kamp (1981) and Smaby (1979) in treating pronouns as bona fide lexical elements at the level of syntactic representation. Treatments of anaphora have taken place within two quite distinct settings, so it seems. On the one hand, linguists have primarily been concerned with the specification of mainly syntactic criteria in determining the proper &amp;quot;binding&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;disjointness&amp;quot; criteria (cf. below), whereas computational linguists have in general paid more attention to anaphoric relations in texts, where semantic and pragmatic features play a much greater role. In trying to relate the two approaches one should be aware that in the absence of any serious theory of text understanding, any attempt to deal with anaphora in unrestricted domains (even if they are simple enough as for instance children&apos;s stories), will encounter so many diverse problems which, even when they influence anaphoric relations, are completely beyond the scope of a systematic treatment at the present moment. We have thought it to be important therefore to impose some constraints right from the start on the type of discourse with respect to which our treatment of anaphora is to be validated (or falsified). Of course, what we are going to say should in principle be extendible to more complex types of discourse in the future. The context of the present inquiry is the querying of relational databases (as opposed to say general discourse analysis). The type of discourse we are interested in are thus dialogues in the setting of a relational database (which may be said to represent both the context of queries and answers as well as the &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;). It should be clear that a wide variety of anaphoric expressions is available in this kind of interaction; on the other hand, the relevant knowledge we assume in resolving pronominal relations must come from the information 144 specified in the database (in the relations, in the various dependencies and integrity constraints) and in the rules governing the language. We are making the following assumptions for database querying. A query dialogue is a sequence of pairs &lt;query,answer&gt;. For the sake of simplicity we assume that the possible answers are of the form yes/no answer singleton answer Spain, to a query like &amp;quot;Who borders Portugal?&amp;quot;) set answer Portugal l to a query like &amp;quot;Who borders Spain?&amp;quot;) multiple answer (1&lt;France,Spain&gt;, to a query like &amp;quot;Who borders who?) and refusal (when a pronoun cannot receive a proper interpretation) 2.1 The User Specialty Languages system The USL system (Lehmann (1978), Ott and Zoeppritz (1979), Lehmann (1980)) provides an interface to a relational data base management system for data entry, query, and manipulation via restricted natural language. The USL System translates input queries expressed in a natural language (currently German (Zoeppritz (1983), English, and Spanish (Sopena (1982))) into expressions in the SQL query language, and evaluates those expressions through the use of System R (Astrahan &amp;al (1976)). The prototype built has been validated with real applications and thus shown its usability. The system consists of (1) a language processing component (ULG), (2) grammars for German, English, and Spanish, (3) a set of 75 interpretation routines, (4) a code generator for SQL, and (5) the data base management system System R. USL runs under VM/CMS in a virtual machine of 7 MBytes, working set size is 1.8 MBytes. ULG, interpretation routines, and code generator comprise approximately 40,000 lines of PL/I code. Syntactic analysis The syntax component of USL uses the User Language Generator (ULG) which originates from the Paris Scientific Center of IBM France and has been described by Bertrand &amp;al (1976). ULG consists of a parser, a semantic executer, the grammar META, and META interpretation routines. META is used to process the grammar of a language. ULG accepts general phrase structure grammars written in a modified Backus-Naur-Form. With any rule it allows the specification of arbitrary, routines to control its application or to perform arbitrary actions, and it allows sophisticated checking and setting of syntactic features. Grammars for German, English, and Spanish have been described in a form accepted by ULG. The grammars provide rules for those fragments of the languages relevant for communicating with a database. The USL grammars have been constructed in such a way that constituents correspond as closely as possible to semantic relationships in the sentence, and that parsing is made as efficient as possible. Where a true representation of the semantic relationships in the parse tree could not be achieved, the burden was put on the interpretation routines to remedy the situation. Interpretation The approach to interpretation in the USL system builds on the ideas of model theoretic semantics. This implies that the meaning of structure words and syntactic constructions is interpreted systematically and independent of the contents of a given database. Furthermore, since a relational database can be regarded as a (partial) model in the sense of model theory, the interpretation of natural language concepts in terms of relations is quite natural. (A more detaiied discussion can be found in Lehmann (1978).) In the USL system, extensions of concepts are represented as virtual relations of a relational database which are defined on physically stored relations (base relations). The set of virtual relations represents the conceptual knowledge about the data and is directly linked to natural language words and phrases. This approach has the advantage that extensions of concepts can relatively easily be related to objects of conventional databases. For illustration of the connection between virtual relations and words, consider the following example. Suppose that for a geographical application someone has arranged the data in the form of the relation CO (COUNTRY,CAPITAL,AREA,POPULATION) Now virtual relations such as the following which correspond to concepts can be formed by simply projecting out the appropriate columns of CO: CAPITAL (NOM_CAPITAL,OF_COUNTRY) Standard role names (OF, NOM, ...) establish the connection between syntactic constructions and columns of virtual relations and enable answering questions such as (1) What is Austria&apos;s capital? in a straightforward and simple way. Standard role names are surface oriented because this makes it possible for a user not trained in linguistics to define his own words and relations. (For a complete list of standard role names see e.g. Zoeppritz (1983).) We are currently working on the integration of the concepts underlying the USL system with Discourse Representation Theory which is described in the next section. We have already implemented a procedure which generates Discourse Representation Structures from USL&apos;s semantic trees and 145 which covers the entire fragment of language described in Kamp (1981). 2.2 Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) this section give a brief description of Kamp&apos;s Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) in as much as it relates to our concerns with pronominalization. For a more detailed discussion of this theory and its general ramifications for natural language processing, cf. the papers by Kamp (1981) and Guenthner (1983a, 1983b). According to DRT, each natural language sentence (or discourse) is associated with a so-called Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) on the basis of a set of DRS formation rules. These rules are sensitive to both the syntactic structure of the sentences in question as well as to the DRS context in which in the sentence occurs. In the formulation of Kamp (1981) the latter is really of importance only in connection with the proper analysis of pronouns. We feel on the other hand that the DRS environment of a sentence to be processed should determine much more than just the anaphoric assignments. We shall discuss this issue in particular as it relates to problems of ambiguity and vagueness in more depth in a forthcoming paper. A DRS K for a discourse has the general form = Con&gt; where U is a set of &amp;quot;discourse referents&amp;quot; for K and Con a set of &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot; on these individuals. can be either complex. An atomic condition has the form P(t1,...,tn) or tl=c where ti is a discourse referent and c a proper name and P an n-place predicate. The only complex condition we shall discuss here is the one representing universally quantified noun phrases or conditional sentences. Both are treated in much the same way. Let us call these implicational&amp;quot; conditions: K1 IMP K2 where K1 and K2 are also DRSs. With a discourse D is thus associated a Discourse Representation structure which represents D in a quantifier-free &amp;quot;clausal&amp;quot; form, and which captures the propositional import of the discourse by among other things, establishing the correct pronominal connections. What is important for the treatment of anaphora in the present context is the following: a) Given a discourse with a principal DRS Ko and a set of non-principal DRSs (or conditions) Ki among its conditions all discourse referents of Ko are admissible referents for pronouns in sentences or (phrases) giving rise to the various embedded Ki&apos;s. In particular, all occurrences of proper names in a discourse will always be associated with discourse referents of the principal DRS Ko. (This is on the (admittedly unrealistic) assumption that proper names refer uniquely.) b) Given an implicational DRS of the form 1&lt;1 IMP K2 occurring in a DRS K, a relation of relative accessibility between DRSs is defined as follows: K1 is accessible from K2 and all K&apos; accessible from K1 are also accessible from K2. In particular, the principal DRS Ko is accessible from its subordinate DRSs (for a precise definition cf. Kamp (1981)). The import of this definition for anaphora is simply that if a pronoun is being resolved (i.e. interpreted) in the context of a DRS which a set K of DRSs is accessible, then the union of all the sets of discourse referents associated with every Ki in K is the set of admissible candidates for the interpretation of the pronoun. The following illustrations will make this clear: K(Every country imports a product it needs) u2 import(ul,u2) product(u2) need(ul,u2) This sentence (as well as its interrogative version) only one interpretation of the pronoun according to DRT. It does not introduce any discourse referent available for pronominalization in later sentences (or queries). But in a DRS like the following, DRT does not as it stands account for pronoun resolution: K(John tickled Bill. He squirmed) ul u2 ul = John u2 = Bill tickled(ul,u2) this point, the pronoun to be interpreted. There are two admissible candidates, ul and u2, but DRT does not choose between them. So the DRS could be continued with either squirm(u1) or squirm(u2) Similarly, in the following DRS ul country(u1) IMP 146 K(If Spain is a member of every organization, it has a member) u3 member( u3 , it) member(u 1 ,u2) pronoun only refer to Spain (on configurational grounds), and would have to be assigned that object if no other criteria are assumed. Obviously, as far as this sentence and the intended database is concerned, we should want to rule out such an assignment. (This can be done via rule Si discussed below.) In general, then, given a sentence (or discourse) represented in a DRS there will be more candidates for admissible pronoun assignments as one should like to have available when a particular pronoun is to be interpreted. The rules described in Section 3 are meant to capture some of the regularities that arise in typical database querying interactions. c) Finally, given a DRS for a discourse D we can say that a pronoun is properly referential iff it is represented by (i.e. eliminated in favor of) a discourse referent ui occurring in the domain of the principal DRS representing D. (In the context of the constructions illustrated so far, this will be true in particular of proper names as well as of indefinite noun phrases not in the scope of of a universal noun phrase or a conditional.) . The main problem then for the treatment of anaphora is to determine which possible discourse referents should be chosen when we come to the interpretation of a particular pronoun occurrence pi in the formation of the extension of the DRS in which we are working. We would like to suggest the following strategy as a starting point. Consider a query dialogue Q with an already established DRS K and the utterance of a query S, where S contains occurrences of personal pronouns. Suppose further that A(S) is the sole syntactic analysis available for S. Then we regard the construction of the extension of the DRS obtained on the basis of S and K as the value of a partial function f defined on K and A(S). More generally still, as Kamp himself suggests, we can regard the &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; (or information content) of a sentence to be that partial function from DRSs to DRSs. In a given dialogue both the queries and the answers will have the side effect of introducing new individuals and &amp;quot;preference&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;salience&amp;quot; orderings on these individuals, and we want to allow for pronominal reference to these much in the same way that in a text preceding sentences may have determined a set of possible antecedents for pronouns in the curren;ly processed sentence. The DRS built up in the process of a querying session will constitute the &amp;quot;mutual knowledge&amp;quot; available to the user in specifying his further queries as well as in his uses of pronouns. It is on the individuals introduced in the DRSs that the rules to be discussed below are intended to operate. 3 Interplay of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in pronominalization of pronominalization is governed by rules involving morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic criteria. These rules are discussed and illustrated with examples drawn from the context of querying a geographical database. Then a procedure is outlined which uses these rules and applies them in the following order: First morphological criteria are checked, if they fail no further tests are required. Then syntactic (or configurational) criteria are tested. Again, if they fail, no further tests are necessary. Next semantic criteria are applied, and if they do not fail, the pragmatic criteria have to be tested. If more than one candidate remains, the use of the pronoun was pragmatically inappropriate and must be noted as such. 3.1 Strict factors determining the admissibility of anaphora 3.1.1 Morphological criteria Morphological criteria concern the agreement of gender and number. Complications come in, when coordinated noun phrases occur, e.g. (2) John and Bill went to Pisa. They delivered a paper. (3) *John and Bill went to Pisa. He delivered a paper. (4) John and Sue went to Pisa. He delivered a paper. (5) *John or Bill went to Pisa. They delivered a paper. (6) *John or Bill went to Pisa. He delivered a paper. Neither John nor Bill went to They went to Rome. *Either John Bill did not go to Pisa. He to Rome. The starred examples contain inappropriate uses of pronouns. With and-coordination, reference to the complete NP is possible with a plural pronoun. When the members of the coordination are distinct in gender and/or number, reference to them is possible with the corresponding pronouns. Clearly, the same observations hold for interrogative sentences. 3.1.2 Configurational criteria Syntactic criteria operate only within the boundaries of a sentence, outside they are useless. The configurational criteria stemming from DRT however work independent of sentence boundaries. ul = Spain u2 organization(u2) IMP IMP 147 Disjoint reference The rule of &amp;quot;disjoint reference&amp;quot; according to Reinhart (1983) goes back to Chomsky and has been refined by Lasnik (1976) and Reinhart (1983). It is able to handle a variety of well-known cases, such as (9) When did it join the UN? (10) Which countries that import it, produce petrol? (11) *Does it entertain diplomatic relations with Spain&apos;s neighbor? (In the starred example, the use of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is inappropriate, if it is to be coreferential with &amp;quot;Spain&amp;quot;.) Rather than using c-command to formulate this criterion, which is elegant but too strict in some cases (as noted by Reinhart herself and Bolinger (1979), we have chosen an admittedly less elegant, but hopefully reliable, approach to disjoint reference, in that we specify the concrete syntactic configurations where disjoint reference holds. We do not rely here on the syntactic framework of USL grammar, but use more or less traditionally known terminology for expressing our rules. We need the terms &amp;quot;clause&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;phrase&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;matrix&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;embedding&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;level&amp;quot;. These can be made explicit, when a suitable syntactic framework is chosen. Now we can formulate our disjoint reference rule and some of its less obvious consequences. Cl. The referent of a personal pronoun can never be within the same clause at the same phrase level. (Note that this rule does not hold for possessive pronouns.) a number of consequences which we now list: Cla. The (implicit) subject of an infinitve clause can never be referent of a personal pronoun in that clause (12) Does the EC want to dissolve it? Cib. Nouns common to coordinate clauses cannot be referred to from within these coordinate clauses (13) Which country borders it and Spain? Clc. Noun complements of nouns in the same clause can never be referred to. (14) Does it border Spain&apos;s neighbors? The following rules have to do with phrases and clauses modifying a noun. They too can be regarded as consequences of Cl. C2. Head noun of a phrase or clause can never be referent of a personal pronoun in that phrase or clause C2a. Head noun of participial phrase (15) a country exporting petrol to it C2b. Head noun of that-clause (16) the truth is that it follows from A. C2c. Head noun of relative clause (17) the country it exports petrol to The following two rules deal with kataphoric pronominalization (sometimes called backward pronominalization). into a more deeply embedded clause is impossible (18) Did it export a product that Spain produces? into a succeeding coordinate clause is impossible (19) Who did not belong to it but left the UN? accessibility DRSs those discourse referents in the accessibility relation defined in sec. 2.2 are available as referents to a pronoun. 3.1.3 Semantic criteria used the criterion of semantic compatibili- It is usually implemented via &amp;quot;semantic tures&amp;quot;. In the USL framework we can derive this information from relation schemata. We state the criterion as follows: s is a sentence containing a pronoun p and c a full noun phrase in the context of p. If p is substituted by c in s to yield s&apos; and s&apos; is not semantically anomalous, i.e. does not imply a contradiction, then c is semantically compatible with s and is hence a semantically possible candidate for the reference of p. (20) What is the capital of Austria? - Vienna. What does it export? If it is assumed that only countries but not capitals export goods, then the only semantically possible referent for &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; is Austria. introduced nouns cannot be antecedents of pronouns. (21) Which countries does Italy have trade with? How large is it? Since &amp;quot;trade&amp;quot; is used non-referentially, it cannot be antecedent of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;. Unfortunately, in many cases where this criterion could apply, there is an ambiguity between referential and non-referential use. Apart from the type of semantic compatibility by rule complex semantic properties are used to determine the referent of a pronoun. The &amp;quot;task structures&amp;quot; described by Grosz (1977) illustrate this fact. We hence formulate the rule 148 The properties of and relationships between discourse it was illegal, because the mutual knowpredicates determine pronominalizability. ledge has increased in the meantime. For an illustration of its effect, consider the following query: (22) What country is its neighbor? The irreflexivity of the neighbor-relation entails that &amp;quot;its&amp;quot; cannot be bound by &amp;quot;what country&amp;quot; in this case, but has to refer to something mentioned in the previous context. Given a subject domain, one can analyze the properties of the relations and the relationships between them and so build a basis for deciding pronoun reference on semantic grounds. In the framework of the USL system, information on the properties of relations is available in terms of &amp;quot;functional dependencies&amp;quot; given in the database schema or as integrity constraints. 3.2 Pragmatic criteria The generation of discourse is controlled by two factors: communicative intentions and mutual knowledge. In the context of database interaction, we can assume that the communicative intentions of user simply to obtain factual answers to factual questions. His intentions are expressed either by single queries or by sequences of queries, depending on how complex these intentions are or how closely they correspond to the information in database. As will below, in many cases the system will not have a chance to deterwhether a given query is &amp;quot;one-shot query&amp;quot;, or whether it is part of a sequence of queries with a common &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;. For the resolution of pronouns, this means that the system should rather ask the user back than make wild guesses on what might be the most &amp;quot;plausible&amp;quot; referent. This is of course possible when running text is in a &amp;quot;batch mode&amp;quot;, and no user is there to be asked for clarification. Mutual knowledge (see e.g. Clark and Marshall for a discussion) determines the rules introducing and referencing individuals in the discourse. In the context of database interaction we the mutual knowledge to consist initially the set of proper names in the database, the predicates whose extensions are in the database, the &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; relationships between and properties of these predicates. It will be part of the design of a database to establish what these &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; relationships and properties are,&apos; e.g. whether it is generally known to the user community, whether &amp;quot;capital&amp;quot; expresses a one-one relation. Each question-answer pair occurring in the discourse is added to the stock of mutual knowledge. It is a pragmatic principle of pronominalization that only mutual knowledge may be used to determine the referent of a pronoun on semantic grounds, and hence it may be legal to use the same sentence containing a pronoun where earlier in the A first attempt using rules What the topic of a discourse is, which of the entities mentioned in it are in focus, is reflected in the syntactic structure of sentences. This has been observed for a long time. It has also often been observed that discourse topic and focus have an effect on pronominalization where morphological, configurational, and semantic rules fail to determine a single candidate for reference. However, it has not been possible yet to formulate precise rules explaining this phenomenon. We have the impression that such rules cannot be absolutely strict rules, but are of a preferential nature. We have developed a set of such rules and tested them against a corpus of text containing some 600 pronoun occurrences, and have found them to work remarkably well. Similar tests (with a similar set of rules) have been conducted by Hofmann (1976). In the sequel we formulate and discuss our list of rules. Their ordering corresponds to the order in which they have to be applied. (principle of proximity). Noun within the sentence containing the pronoun are preferred over noun phrases in previous or succeeding sentences. Consider the sequence (23) What country joined the EC after 1980? - Greece. (24) What country consumes the wine it produces? One could argue that &amp;quot;Greece&amp;quot; is just as probably the intended referent of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in this case as the bound interpretation and that hence the use of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; be rejected as there is no way to avoid the &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;, if the bound variable interpretation is intended, and one can use as a ground to rule out the interpretation wherefers to &amp;quot;Greece&amp;quot;. Pla. Noun phrases in sentences before the sentence containing the pronoun are preferred over noun phrases in more distant sentences. criterion is very important to the for possible discourse referents. are preferred over full noun phrases. This rule is found in many systems dealing with anaphora. One can motivate it by saying that pronominalization establishes an entity as a theme which is then maintained until the chain of pronouns is broken by a sentence not containing a suitable pronoun. For an example consider: (25) What is the area of Austria? (26) What is its capital? (27) What is its population? 149 phrases in a matrix clause or phrase are preferred over noun phrases in embedded clauses or phrases. phrases in a matrix clause are preferred over noun phrases in embedded clauses. Example: (28) What country imports a product that Spain produces? - Denmark. (29) What does it export? Here &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; has to refer to the individual satisfying &amp;quot;what country&amp;quot;, not to &amp;quot;Spain&amp;quot; which occurs in an embedded clause. nouns are preferred over noun complements. Example: (30) What is the capital of Austria? - Vienna. (31) What is its population? &amp;quot;Vienna&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;Austria&amp;quot; becomes the referent of &amp;quot;its&amp;quot;, and the argument is analogous to that for P3a. noun phrases are preferred over non-subject noun phrases. In declarative contexts, this rule works quite well. It corresponds essentially to the focus rule of Sidner (1981). In a question-answering situation it is hardly applicable, since especially in wh-questions subject position and word order, which both play a role, tend to interfere. We therefore tend to not use this rule, but rather to let the system ask back in cases where it would apply. For illustration consider the following examples: (32) Does Spain border Portugal? What is its population? (33) Is Spain bordered by Portugal? What is its population? (34) Which country borders Portugal? What is its population? (35) Which country does Portugal border? What is its population? object noun phrases are preferred over other non-subject noun phrases. Pti. Noun phrases preceding the pronoun are preferred over noun phrases succeeding the pronoun (or: anaphora is preferred over kataphora). 3.3 Outline of a pronoun resolution procedure We now outline a procedure for &amp;quot;resolving&amp;quot; pronouns in the framework of the USL system and DRT. Let M = &lt;U, Con&gt; be the DRS representing the mutual knowledge, in particular the past discourse. Let K(s) be the DRS representing the current sentence s and let p be a pronoun occurring in s for which an appropriate discourse referent has to be Let the set of discourse referents accessible to p according to the accessibility relation given in sec. 2.2 Let further c be a function that applies to U a(P) all the morphological, syntactic, and semantic crigiven above and yields a set result. Now three cases have to be distinguished: 1. Uis empty. In this case the use of p was inappropriate. 2. is 1. In this case a referent for p has been uniquely determined, p is replaced by it in the DRS, and the procedure is finished. 3. is greater than 1. In this case the preference rules are applied. p a function that applies to the of greater than 1 all the preference rules given above in the order indicated there yielding the result U . Card(U ) can never be 0, hence two cases are possible, either the cardinality is 1, then a referent has been uniquely determined and the pronoun p can be eliminated in K, or the cardinality is greater than 1, and then the use of p was inappropriate. It can be inferred from the formulation of the pronominalization rules given above, what morphological and syntactic information has to be stored with the discourse referents in the DRSs, and what semantic information has to be accessible from the schema of the database to enable the application of functions c and Hence, we will not spell out these details here. 4 Open questions and conclusions Many well-known and puzzling cases have not been addressed here, among them plural anaphora, so-called pronouns of laziness, one pronominalization, to name just a few. have not anything about phenomena as topic, focus, or coherence their influence on anaphora. Their effects are captured in our preference rules to some degree, but no one can precisely say how. Inspite of claims to the contrary, we believe that much work is still rebefore these notions can effectively in natural language processing. By limiting ourselves to the relatively well-defined communicative situation of database interaction, we have been able to state precisely, what rules are applicable in the fragment of language we are dealing with. We are currently working on the analysis of running texts, but again in a well-delineated domain, and we hope to be able to extend our theory on the basis of the experience gained. 150 We are convinced that serious progress in the of anaphora and of discourse phegeneral is only possible through a careful control of the environment, and on a solid syntactic and semantic foundation.</abstract>

We have drawn extensively -- as far as insights, examples, puzzles and adequacy conditions are concerned -- on the various &amp;quot;variable binding&amp;quot; approaches to pronouns (e.g. work in the Montague tradition, the illuminating discussion by Evans (1980) and Webber (1978), as well as recent transformational accounts). Our approach has however been most deeply influenced by those who have (like Smaby (1979), (1981) and Kamp (1981)) advocated dispensing with pronoun indexing on the one hand and by those (like Chastain (1973), Evans (1980), and Kamp (1981)) who have emphasized the &amp;quot;referential&amp;quot; function of certain uses of indefinite noun phrases. 2 Background Contrary to what is assumed in most theories of pronominalization (namely that the most propitious way of dealing with pronouns is to consider them as a kind of indexed variable), we agree with Kamp (1981) and Smaby (1979) in treating pronouns as bona fide lexical elements at the level of syntactic representation. Treatments of anaphora have taken place within two quite distinct settings, so it seems. On the one hand, linguists have primarily been concerned w</context>

Unfortunately, in many cases where this criterion could apply, there is an ambiguity between referential and non-referential use. Apart from the type of semantic compatibility covered by rule Si, more complex semantic properties are used to determine the referent of a pronoun.

Even though there is a plethora of research attempting to specify (both on the theoretical level as well as in connection with implementations) &amp;quot;strategies&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;pronoun resolution&amp;quot;, it is fair to say a) that no uniform and comprehensive treatment of anaphora has yet been attained b) that surprisingly little effort has been spent in applying the results of research in linguistics and formal semantics in actual implemented systems. A quick glance at Hirst (1981) will confirm that there is a large gap between the kinds of theoretical issues and puzzling cases that have been considered on the one hand in the setting of computational linguistics and on the other in recent semantically oriented approaches to the formal analysis of natural languages. One of the main aims of this paper is to bridge this gap by combining recent efforts forthcoming in formal semantics (based on Montague grammar and Discourse Representation Theory) with existing and relatively comprehensive grammars of German and English constructed in connection with the User Specialty Langu</context>

However, it has not been possible yet to formulate precise rules explaining this phenomenon. We have the impression that such rules cannot be absolutely strict rules, but are of a preferential nature. We have developed a set of such rules and tested them against a corpus of text containing some 600 pronoun occurrences, and have found them to work remarkably well. Similar tests (with a similar set of rules) have been conducted by Hofmann (1976). In the sequel we formulate and discuss our list of rules. Their ordering corresponds to the order in which they have to be applied. P1 (principle of proximity). Noun phrases within the sentence containing the pronoun are preferred over noun phrases in previous or succeeding sentences. Consider the sequence (23) What country joined the EC after 1980? - Greece. (24) What country consumes the wine it produces? One could argue that &amp;quot;Greece&amp;quot; is just as probably the intended referent of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; in this case as the bound interpretation and that hence the use of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; should be rejected as inappropriate</context>

In particular, all occurrences of proper names in a discourse will always be associated with discourse referents of the principal DRS Ko. (This is on the (admittedly unrealistic) assumption that proper names refer uniquely.) b) Given an implicational DRS of the form 1&lt;1 IMP K2 occurring in a DRS K, a relation of relative accessibility between DRSs is defined as follows: K1 is accessible from K2 and all K&apos; accessible from K1 are also accessible from K2. In particular, the principal DRS Ko is accessible from its subordinate DRSs (for a precise definition cf. Kamp (1981)). The import of this definition for anaphora is simply that if a pronoun is being resolved (i.e. interpreted) in the context of a DRS K&apos; from which a set K of DRSs is accessible, then the union of all the sets of discourse referents associated with every Ki in K is the set of admissible candidates for the interpretation of the pronoun. The following illustrations will make this clear: K(Every country imports a product it needs) u2 import(ul,u2) product(u2) need(ul,u2) This sentence (as well as its interrogative version) allows only one interpretation of the pronoun it according to DRT.

Interpretation The approach to interpretation in the USL system builds on the ideas of model theoretic semantics. This implies that the meaning of structure words and syntactic constructions is interpreted systematically and independent of the contents of a given database. Furthermore, since a relational database can be regarded as a (partial) model in the sense of model theory, the interpretation of natural language concepts in terms of relations is quite natural. (A more detaiied discussion can be found in Lehmann (1978).) In the USL system, extensions of concepts are represented as virtual relations of a relational database which are defined on physically stored relations (base relations). The set of virtual relations represents the conceptual knowledge about the data and is directly linked to natural language words and phrases. This approach has the advantage that extensions of concepts can relatively easily be related to objects of conventional databases. For illustration of the connection between virtual relations and words, consider the following example. Suppose that for a geographical application someo</context>

Here &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; has to refer to the individual satisfying &amp;quot;what country&amp;quot;, not to &amp;quot;Spain&amp;quot; which occurs in an embedded clause. P3b. Head nouns are preferred over noun complements. Example: (30) What is the capital of Austria? - Vienna. (31) What is its population? &amp;quot;Vienna&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;Austria&amp;quot; becomes the referent of &amp;quot;its&amp;quot;, and the argument is analogous to that for P3a. P4. Subject noun phrases are preferred over non-subject noun phrases. In declarative contexts, this rule works quite well. It corresponds essentially to the focus rule of Sidner (1981). In a question-answering situation it is hardly applicable, since especially in wh-questions subject position and word order, which both play a role, tend to interfere. We therefore tend to not use this rule, but rather to let the system ask back in cases where it would apply. For illustration consider the following examples: (32) Does Spain border Portugal? What is its population? (33) Is Spain bordered by Portugal? What is its population? (34) Which country borders Portugal? What is its population? (35) Which country does Portugal border? What is its population? 135. Accusative object noun </context>

The USL System translates input queries expressed in a natural language (currently German (Zoeppritz (1983), English, and Spanish (Sopena (1982))) into expressions in the SQL query language, and evaluates those expressions through the use of System R (Astrahan &amp;al (1976)). The prototype built has been validated with real applications and thus shown its usability. The system consists of (1) a language processing component (ULG), (2) grammars for German, English, and Spanish, (3) a set of 75 interpretation routines, (4) a code generator for SQL, and (5) the data base management system System R. USL runs under VM/CMS in a virtual machine of 7 MBytes, working set size is 1.8 MBytes. ULG, interpretation</context>

Standard role names are surface oriented because this makes it possible for a user not trained in linguistics to define his own words and relations. (For a complete list of standard role names see e.g. Zoeppritz (1983).) We are currently working on the integration of the concepts underlying the USL system with Discourse Representation Theory which is described in the next section. We have already implemented a procedure which generates Discourse Representation Structures from USL&apos;s semantic trees and 145 which covers the entire fragment of language described in Kamp (1981). 2.2 Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) In this section we give a brief description of Kamp&apos;s Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) in as much as it relates to our concerns with pronominalization.
