Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999855">
Research in comparable corpora has been motivated by two main reasons in the language engineering
and the linguistics communities. In language engineering, it is chiefly motivated by the need to use
comparable corpora as training data for statistical NLP applications such as statistical machine translation
or cross-language information retrieval. In linguistics, on the other hand, comparable corpora are of
interest themselves in providing intra-linguistic discoveries and comparisons. It is generally accepted in
both communities that comparable corpora are documents in one to many languages, that are comparable
in content and form in various degrees and dimensions. It was pointed out that parallel corpora are at one
end of the spectrum of comparability whereas quasi-comparable corpora are at the other end. We believe
that the linguistic definitions and observations in comparable corpora can improve methods to mine such
corpora for applications to statistical NLP. As such, it is of great interest to bring together builders and
users of such corpora.
Parallel corpora are a key resource as training data for statistical machine translation, and for building or
extending bilingual lexicons and terminologies. However, beyond a few language pairs such as English-
French or English-Chinese and a few contexts such as parliamentary debates or legal texts, they remain
a scarce resource, despite the creation of automated methods to collect parallel corpora from the Web.
Interest in non-parallel forms of comparable corpora in language engineering primarily ensued from the
scarcity of parallel corpora. This has motivated research into the use of comparable corpora: pairs of
monolingual corpora selected according to the same set of criteria, but in different languages or language
varieties. Non-parallel yet comparable corpora overcome the two limitations of parallel corpora, since
sources for original, monolingual texts are much more abundant than translated texts. However, because
of their nature, mining translations in comparable corpora is much more challenging than in parallel
corpora. What constitutes a good comparable corpus, for a given task or per se, also requires specific
attention: while the definition of a parallel corpus is fairly straightforward, building a non-parallel corpus
requires control over the selection of source texts in both languages.
With the advent of online data, the potential for building and exploring comparable corpora is growing
exponentially. Comparable documents in languages that are very different from each other pose special
challenges as very often, the non-parallel-ness in sentences can result from cultural and political
differences.
Following the success of the first workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora at LREC 2008 in
Marrakech, this second workshop again brings together language engineers as well as linguists interested
in the constitution and use of comparable corpora, ranging from parallel to non-parallel corpora. In the
larger context of the joint ACL-IJCNLP conference, this time the workshop specifically aimed to solicit
contributions from researchers in different geographical regions, in order to highlight in particular the
issues with comparable corpora across languages that are very different from each other, such as across
Asian and European languages. Research in minority languages is also of particular interest. We are very
glad to include papers on languages as varied as Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Japanese, Uyghur and
even sign language.
We would like to thank all people who in one way or another helped in making this workshop a success.
Our particular thanks go to Ken Church for accepting to give the invited presentation, to the participants
of the panel discussion, to the members of the program committee, to the ACL-IJCNLP workshop co-
chairs Jimmy Lin and Yuji Matsumoto, and to the members of the local organizing committee. Last but
not least we would like to thank our authors and the participants of the workshop.
