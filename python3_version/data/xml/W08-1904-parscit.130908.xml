<bodyText confidence="0.999905941176471">
ProPOSEL is a prosody and PoS English lexicon,
purpose-built to integrate and leverage domain
knowledge from several well-established lexical
resources for machine learning and NLP applica-
tions. The lexicon of 104049 separate entries is
in accessible text file format, is human and ma-
chine-readable, and is intended for open source
distribution with the Natural Language ToolKit.
It is therefore supported by Python software tools
which transform ProPOSEL into a Python dic-
tionary or associative array of linguistic concepts
mapped to compound lookup keys. Users can
also conduct searches on a subset of the lexicon
and access entries by word class, phonetic tran-
scription, syllable count and lexical stress pat-
tern. ProPOSEL caters for a range of different
cognitive aspects of the lexicon©.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99624">
ProPOSEL (Brierley and Atwell, 2008) is a pros-
ody and part-of-speech (PoS) English lexicon
which merges information from respected elec-
tronic dictionaries and databases, and which is
purpose-built for linkage with corpora; for popu-
lating tokenized corpus text with a priori linguis-
tic knowledge; for machine learning tasks which
involve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text;
and for open source distribution with NLTK - the
Python-based Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et
al, 2007a).

A pronunciation lexicon like ProPOSEL is an
integral part of the front-end natural language
processing (NLP) module in a generic text-to-
speech (TTS) synthesis system and constitutes a
natural way of giving such a system phonetic,
prosodic and morpho-syntactic insights into input
text. For English, three such resources, originally
developed for automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and listing words and their phonetic tran-
scriptions, are widely used: CELEX-2 (Baayen et
al, 1996); PRONLEX (Kingsbury et al, 1997);
and CMU, the Carnegie-Mellon Pronouncing
Dictionary (Carnegie-Mellon University, 1998).
The latter is used in Edinburgh’s state of the art
Festival speech synthesis system (Black et al,
1999) and is included as one of the datasets in
NLTK.
The starting point for ProPOSEL is CUVPlus1
(Pedler, 2002), a computer-usable and human-
readable dictionary of inflected forms which
uniquely identifies word class for each entry via
C5 PoS tags, the syntactic annotation scheme
used in the BNC or British National Corpus
(Burnard, 2000). CUVPlus is an updated version
of CUV2 (Mitton, 1992), an electronic dictionary
in accessible text file format which in turn de-
rives from the traditional paper-based Oxford
Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current Eng-
lish (Hornby, 1974).
Recently, lexica for thirteen world lan-
guages, including US-English, have been
created via the European-funded LC-STAR
project (Hartinkainen et al, 2003) to address the
shortage of language resources in the form of
wide coverage lexica with detailed morpho-
syntactic information that meet the needs of
ASR, TTS and speech-to-speech translation
(SST) applications. The incorporation of C5 PoS-
tags in CUVPlus provides this kind of detail and

distinguishes this lexicon from other paper-based
and electronic English dictionaries, including
CELEX-2, PRONLEX and CMU; it also facili-
tates linkage with machine-readable corpora like
the BNC.
However, CUVPlus entries compact PoS vari-
ants for a given word form into a single field as
in the following example where burning is classi-
fied as an adjective, a present participle and a
noun in Table 1:

An early operation during ProPOSEL build was
therefore to introduce one-to-one mappings of
word form to word class, as defined by C5, to
facilitate their use as compound lookup keys
when the lexicon is transformed into a Python
dictionary or associative array (§4).

(2002) and Mitton (1992). A full account of Pro-
POSEL build is planned for a subsequent paper,
where phonology fields in source lexica (CU-
VPlus, CELEX-2 and CMU) and new phonology
fields in the prosody and PoS English lexicon
will be discussed in detail. The rationale for
fields displaying syllable count, lexical stress
pattern and CFP status is summarised here in
section 3.
Four major PoS tagging schemes have been
included in ProPOSEL to facilitate linkage with
several widely used speech corpora: C5 (field 2)
with the BNC as mentioned; Penn Treebank
(field 9) with Treebank-3 (Marcus et al, 1999);
LOB (Johansson et al, 1986) (field 11) with
MARSEC (Roach et al, 1993); and C7 (field 12)
with the 2 million-word BNC Sampler Corpus.
The lookup mechanism described in section 4
where a match is sought between (token, tag)
tuples in incoming corpus text and ProPOSEL’s
compound dictionary keys, also in the form of
(token, tag) tuples, is possible for all four syntac-
tic annotation schemes represented in the lexi-
con.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997656642857143">
One field of particular significance for Pro-
POSEL’s target application of prosodic phrase
break prediction (§3) is field (8) for lexical stress
patterns, symbolic representations of the rhyth-
mic structure of word forms via a string of num-
bers. Thus the pattern for the word form
,objec’tivity - with secondary stress on the first
syllable and primary stress on the third syllable -
is 20100. For some homographs, this lexical
stress pattern can fluctuate depending on part-of-
speech category and meaning. The wordform
present is a case in point, as demonstrated by
fields 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 10 for all its entries in
ProPOSEL shown in Table 3:

<bodyText confidence="0.999811125">
Two well established phonetic transcription
schemes are also represented in ProPOSEL: the
original SAM-PA transcriptions in field 4 and
DISC stressed and syllabified transcriptions in
fields 13 and 14 which, unlike SAM-PA and the
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), use a sin-
gle character to represent dipthongs: /p8R/ for
pair, for example.

Phonology fields in ProPOSEL constitute a range
of access routes for users. As an illustration, a
search for like candidates to the verb obliterate
might focus on structure and sound: verbs of 4
syllables (fields 2 and 7), with vowel reduction
on the first syllable (fields 8 or 14), and primary
stress on the second syllable (again, a choice of
fields as users may wish to use the SAM-PA
phonetic transcriptions). This filter retrieves
sixty-seven candidates - most but not all of them
end in /eIt/ - and includes one oddity among
the examples in Table 4. Further examples of live
filtered searches are presented in section 5.

4 ProPOSEL: domain knowledge for
machine learning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960890909091">
As previously stated, the rationale for ProPOSEL
was to integrate information from different dic-
tionaries and databases into one lexicon, custom-
ised for language engineering tasks which in-
volve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text.
One such task is automated phrase break predic-
tion: the classification of junctures (whitespaces)
between words in the input text as either breaks
(the minority class) or non-breaks. Typically, the
machine learner is trained on PoS-tagged and
boundary-annotated text - the speech corpus or
gold standard - and then tested on an unseen ref-
erence dataset, minus the boundary tags, from the
same corpus. Finally, it is evaluated by counting
how many of the original boundary locations
have been recaptured or predicted by the model.
Phrase break classifiers have been trained on
additional text-based features besides PoS tags.
The CFP status of a token - is it a content word
(e.g. nouns or adjectives) or function word (e.g.
prepositions or articles) or punctuation mark? -
has proved to be a very effective attribute in both
deterministic and probabilistic models (Liberman
and Church, 1992; Busser et al, 2001) and there-
fore, a default content-word/function-word tag is
assigned to each entry in ProPOSEL in field (10).
It is anticipated that further research will suggest
modifications to this default status when the CFP
attribute interacts with other text-based features.
Syllable counts - field (7) in ProPOSEL - have
already been used successfully in phrase break
models for English (Atterer and Klein, 2002).
However, they assume uniformity in terms of
duration of syllables whereas we know that in
connected speech, an indefinite number of un-
stressed syllables are packed into the gap be-
tween one stress pulse (Mortimer, 1985) and an-
other, English being a stress-timed language. A
lexical stress pattern, where syllables are
weighted 0, 1 or 2, has therefore been included in
fields (8) and (14) for entries in ProPOSEL be-
cause of its potential as a classificatory feature in
the machine learning task of phrase break predic-
tion.
The thematic programme for PASCAL 3 in
2008 focuses on approaches to supplementing
raw training data (e.g. the speech corpus) with a
priori knowledge (e.g. the lexicon) to improve
performance in machine learning. The prosody-
syntax interface is notoriously complex. Planned
research into the phrase break prediction task
will attempt to incorporate a dictionary-derived
feature such as lexical stress (field 8 in Pro-
POSEL) into a data-driven model to explore this
interface more fully.

5 Implementing ProPOSEL as a Python
dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988275">
The Python programming language has a dic-
tionary mapping object with entries in the form
of (key, value) pairs. Each key must be unique
and immutable (e.g. a string or tuple), while the
values can be any type (e.g. a list). This data
structure can be exploited by transforming Pro-
POSEL into a live Python dictionary, where the
recommended access strategy is via compound
keys (word form and C5 PoS tag) which
uniquely identify each lexical entry. Thus, using
a sample of 4 entries to represent ProPOSEL and
version 0.8 of NLTK, we can use the code in
Listing 1 (§next page) to convert this mini lexi-
con into the new formalism. The Python diction-
ary method returns an as yet unsorted dictionary,

Listing 1: Code snippet using Python list comprehensions and built-ins to transform the prosody-PoS
English Lexicon into an associative array
For linkage with corpora and for annotating
a corpus with the prior knowledge of phonol-
ogy contained in ProPOSEL, a match is sought
between incoming corpus text in the familiar
(token, tag) format and the dictionary keys
(§Table 5). Thus intersection enables corpus
text to accumulate additional values which
have the potential to become features for ma-
chine learning tasks. This lookup mechanism
is relatively straightforward for corpora tagged
with C5, the basic tagset used in the BNC. For
corpora tagged with alternative schemes (i.e.
Penn, LOB, and C7), incoming tokens and
tags can either be matched against word forms
and PoS tokens in the corresponding tagset
field in the lexicon, or C5 tags can be ap-
pended to each item in the input text such that
lookup can proceed in the normal way.

6 Filtered searches and having fun
with ProPOSEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.930805447368421">
ProPOSEL will be supported by a tutorial, of-
fering a range of Python software compatible
with NLTK, to enable users to prepare the text
file for NLP; to implement ProPOSEL as a
Python dictionary; to cross-reference linguistic
data in the lexicon and corpus text; and to cus-
tomise searches via multiple criteria.
The previous section demonstrated how
fine-grained grammatical distinctions in the
PoS tag field(s) in ProPOSEL are integral to
linkage with corpora. It also demonstrated how
an electronic dictionary in the form of a simple
text file can be reconceived and reconstituted
as a computational data structure known as an
associative memory or array. When Pro-
POSEL is thus transformed, filtered searches
can be performed on the text itself.
Brierley and Atwell (ibid.) present auto-
matic corpus annotations achieved via inter-
section of two parallel iterables: ProPOSEL’s
keys and a LOB-tagged corpus extract (this is
a short extract of 153 tokens just for demon-
stration) which also carries equivalent C5 tags
generated from the lexicon. A successful
match between C5 tags in both lists results in a
corpus sequence object where word tokens and
syntactic annotations have now been comple-
mented with prosodic information from se-
lected fields in ProPOSEL, as in Table 6:
[[&amp;quot;aren&apos;t&amp;quot;, &apos;BER+XNOT&apos;, &apos;VBB+XX0&apos;,
[&apos;1&apos;, &apos;1&apos;, &apos;CF&apos;, &amp;quot;&apos;#nt:1&amp;quot;]]
Table 6: Entry index of length 3, with word
token mapped to LOB and C5 tags plus sylla-
ble count, lexical stress pattern, CFP status and
syllable-stress mapping
The corpus sequence object can now be
queried. Suppose, for instance, we wanted to
find all bi-syllabic prepositions and particles in

this extract. By specifying part-of-speech and
syllable count, we unearth just one candidate
matching our search criteria, as shown in Ta-
ble 7:
[&apos;between&apos;, &apos;IN&apos;, &apos;PRP&apos;, [&apos;2&apos;, &apos;01&apos;,
&apos;F&apos;, &amp;quot;bI:0 &apos;twin:1&amp;quot;]]
Table 7: There is one candidate in the 153
word extract which meets the condition: PoS
equals preposition or particle and syllable
count is 2
It is not always necessary to transform Pro-
POSEL into a Python dictionary, however.
Users can also read in the lexicon textfile, ap-
ply Python’s splitlines() method to process the
text as a list of lines, and then apply the split()
method, with the pipe field separator as argu-
ment, to tokenize each field. Listing 2 presents
this much more succinctly:
corpus and then seek a match in the SAM-PA
field4. We might also look for minimal pairs,
replacing the phoneme /s/ with the phoneme
/z/ as in /&apos;.Op@z/. Retaining the apostrophe
as diacritic for primary stress before the wild-
card here imitates the lexical stress pattern for
corpus and is part of the rhyme. It transpires
there is only one candidate which rhymes with
corpus in the lexicon and two half rhymes.
Listing4 gives us porpoise /&apos;pOp@s/ and then
paupers /&apos;pOp@z/ and torpors /&apos;tOp@z/.

ProPOSEL and associated access tools are
presented to the CogALex workshop audience
to illustrate our approach to enhancing the
structure, indexing and entry points of elec-
tronic dictionaries. As the Call for Papers
notes, “Access strategies vary with the task
(text understanding vs. text production) and
the knowledge available at the moment of con-
sultation (word, concept, sound). Unlike read-
ers who look for meanings, writers start from
them, searching for the corresponding words.
While paper dictionaries are static, permitting
only limited strategies for accessing informa-
tion, their electronic counterparts promise dy-
namic, proactive search via multiple criteria
(meaning, sound, related word) and via diverse
access routes. ... The goal of this workshop is
to perform the groundwork for the next gen-
eration of electronic dictionaries, that is, to
study the possibility of integrating the differ-
ent resources ...” ProPOSEL integrates a range
of different resources, and enables a variety of
access strategies, with consultation based on
various combinations of partial syntactic and
prosodic knowledge of the target words. It ad-
dresses the main themes of the workshop:

Human users of electronic dictionaries can
start from partial concepts or patterns when
they are generating a message or looking for a
(target) word. Other papers in the workshop
focus on semantic cues, such as conceptual
primitives, semantically related words, some
type of partial definition, something like syn-
sets etc; but speakers/writers may also be
searching for a word which matches syntactic,

7.2 Access, navigation and search strategies

The Call for Papers notes that “we would
like to be able to access entries by word form
but also by meaning and sounds (syllables)
...Even if input is given in an incomplete, im-
precise or degraded form.” Meaning is clearly
the main focus of many lexicography re-
searchers, but access by sound, rhythm, pros-
ody, and also syntactic similarity may also
prove useful complementary strategies for
some users.

<bodyText confidence="0.998071882352941">
Another key issue for discussion in the Call
for Papers is robust yet flexible organization of
lexical resources: “Indexing must robustly al-
low for multiple ways of navigation and ac-
cess... ”. By building on and integrating with
Python and the NLTK Natural Language Tool
Kit, ProPOSEL can be accessed by other NLP
tools or via the standard Python interface for
direct browsing and search. ProPOSEL is also
a potential exemplar for lexical entry stan-
dardization. Many lexicographers focus on
standardization of semantics or definitions, but
standardization of syntactic, phonetic and pro-
sodic information is also an issue. Our prag-
matic approach is to integrate lexical entries
from a range of resources into a standardized
Python dictionary format.

7.4 NLP Applications

We initially developed ProPOSEL in the con-
text of research in linking lexical, syntactic
and prosodic markup in English corpus text,
and specifically as a resource for prosodic
phrase break prediction (Brierley and Atwell,
2007a,b,c). The software developed within the
NLTK architecture has been able to utilize
existing NLTK tools for PoS-tagging, phrase-
chunking and partial parsing; in turn, other
researchers in these fields may want to use the
syntactic information in ProPOSEL in their
future NLP applications, particularly in re-
search which attempts to compare or map be-
tween alternative tagsets or labeling systems,
eg (Nancarrow and Atwell 2007), Atwell and
Roberts 2006), (Atwell et al 2000), (Teufel
1995).

8 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999500151515152">
The English lexicon presented in this paper, - a
revised version to that reported in (Brierley
and Atwell, 2008), - is an assembly of domain
knowledge of phonology and syntax from sev-
eral widely used lexical resources. Linkage
with corpora is facilitated by the inclusion of
four variant PoS tagging schemes in the lexi-
con and by re-thinking and reconstituting the
lexicon as a Python dictionary or associative
array. A successful match between (token, tag)
pairings in input text and new linguistic anno-
tations mapped to ProPOSEL’s compound
keys will in turn embed a priori knowledge
from the lexicon in data-driven models derived
from a corpus and enhance performance in
machine learning. The lexicon is also human-
oriented (de Schryver, 2003). ProPOSEL’s
software tools are compatible with NLTK and
enable users to define and search a subset of
the lexicon and access entries by word class,
phonetic transcription, syllable count and
rhythmic structure. ProPOSEL was initially
developed as a language engineering resource
for use in our own research, but in the process
of development we have also addressed sev-
eral more general issues relating to cognitive
aspects of the lexicon: the partial patterns in
the mind of a dictionary user; the need for ac-
cess and search by sound, rhythm, prosody,
and also syntactic similarity; robust and stan-
dardised organization of lexical entries from
different sources; and ease of integration into
NLP applications.

The lexicon of 104049 separate entries is in accessible text file format, is human and machine-readable, and is intended for open source distribution with the Natural Language ToolKit. It is therefore supported by Python software tools which transform ProPOSEL into a Python dictionary or associative array of linguistic concepts mapped to compound lookup keys.

It is anticipated that further research will suggest modifications to this default status when the CFP attribute interacts with other text-based features. Syllable counts - field (7) in ProPOSEL - have already been used successfully in phrase break models for English (Atterer and Klein, 2002). However, they assume uniformity in terms of duration of syllables whereas we know that in connected speech, an indefinite number of unstressed syllables are packed into the gap between one stress pulse (Mortimer, 1985) and another, English being a stress-timed language. A lexical stress pattern, where syllables are weighted 0, 1 or 2, has therefore been included in fields (8) and (14) for entries in ProPOSEL because of its potential as a classificatory feature in the machine learning task of phrase break prediction.

Many lexicographers focus on standardization of semantics or definitions, but standardization of syntactic, phonetic and prosodic information is also an issue. Our pragmatic approach is to integrate lexical entries from a range of resources into a standardized Python dictionary format. 7.4 NLP Applications We initially developed ProPOSEL in the context of research in linking lexical, syntactic and prosodic markup in English corpus text, and specifically as a resource for prosodic phrase break prediction (Brierley and Atwell, 2007a,b,c).

ProPOSEL caters for a range of different cognitive aspects of the lexicon©. 1 Introduction ProPOSEL (Brierley and Atwell, 2008) is a prosody and part-of-speech (PoS) English lexicon which merges information from respected electronic dictionaries and databases, and which is purpose-built for linkage with corpora; for populating tokenized corpus text with a priori linguistic knowledge; for machine learning tasks which involve the prosodic-syntactic chunking of text; and for open source distribution with NLTK - the Python-based Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et al, 2007a). © © 2008.

Linkage with corpora is facilitated by the inclusion of four variant PoS tagging schemes in the lexicon and by re-thinking and reconstituting the lexicon as a Python dictionary or associative array. A successful match between (token, tag) pairings in input text and new linguistic annotations mapped to ProPOSEL’s compound keys will in turn embed a priori knowledge from the lexicon in data-driven models derived from a corpus and enhance performance in machine learning.

Finally, it is evaluated by counting how many of the original boundary locations have been recaptured or predicted by the model. Phrase break classifiers have been trained on additional text-based features besides PoS tags. The CFP status of a token - is it a content word (e.g. nouns or adjectives) or function word (e.g. prepositions or articles) or punctuation mark? - has proved to be a very effective attribute in both deterministic and probabilistic models (Liberman and Church, 1992; Busser et al, 2001) and therefore, a default content-word/function-word tag is assigned to each entry in ProPOSEL in field (10). It is anticipated that further research will suggest modifications to this default status when the CFP attribute interacts with other text-based features. Syllable counts - field (7) in ProPOSEL - have already been used successfully in phrase break models for English (Atterer and Klein, 2002). However, they assume uniformity in terms of duration of syllables whereas we know that in connected speech, an indefinite number of unstressed syllables are packed into the g</context>

Syllable counts - field (7) in ProPOSEL - have already been used successfully in phrase break models for English (Atterer and Klein, 2002). However, they assume uniformity in terms of duration of syllables whereas we know that in connected speech, an indefinite number of unstressed syllables are packed into the gap between one stress pulse (Mortimer, 1985) and another, English being a stress-timed language. A lexical stress pattern, where syllables are weighted 0, 1 or 2, has therefore been included in fields (8) and (14) for entries in ProPOSEL because of its potential as a classificatory feature in the machine learning task of phrase break prediction. The thematic programme for PASCAL 3 in 2008 focuses on approaches to supplementing raw training data (e.g. the speech corpus) with a priori knowledge (e.g. the lexicon) to improve performance in machine learning. The prosodysyntax interface is notoriously complex. Planned research into the phras</context>

For English, three such resources, originally developed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and listing words and their phonetic transcriptions, are widely used: CELEX-2 (Baayen et al, 1996); PRONLEX (Kingsbury et al, 1997); and CMU, the Carnegie-Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary (Carnegie-Mellon University, 1998). The latter is used in Edinburgh’s state of the art Festival speech synthesis system (Black et al, 1999) and is included as one of the datasets in NLTK. The starting point for ProPOSEL is CUVPlus1 (Pedler, 2002), a computer-usable and humanreadable dictionary of inflected forms which uniquely identifies word class for each entry via C5 PoS tags, the syntactic annotation scheme used in the BNC or British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000). CUVPlus is an updated version of CUV2 (Mitton, 1992), an electronic dictionary in accessible text file format which in turn derives from the traditional paper-based Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current English (Hornby, 1974). Recently, lexica for thirteen world languages, including US-English, have been created via the European-funded LC-STAR project (Hartin</context>

The rationale for fields displaying syllable count, lexical stress pattern and CFP status is summarised here in section 3. Four major PoS tagging schemes have been included in ProPOSEL to facilitate linkage with several widely used speech corpora: C5 (field 2) with the BNC as mentioned; Penn Treebank (field 9) with Treebank-3 (Marcus et al, 1999); LOB (Johansson et al, 1986) (field 11) with MARSEC (Roach et al, 1993); and C7 (field 12) with the 2 million-word BNC Sampler Corpus. The lookup mechanism described in section 4 where a match is sought between (token, tag) tuples in incoming corpus text and ProPOSEL’s compound dictionary keys, also in the form of (token, tag) tuples, is possible for all four syntactic annotation schemes represented in the lexicon. 3 Accessing the lexicon through sound, syllables and rhythmic structure One field of particular significance for ProPOSEL’s target application of prosodic phrase break prediction (§3) is field (8) for lexical stress patterns, symbolic representations o</context>

A successful match between (token, tag) pairings in input text and new linguistic annotations mapped to ProPOSEL’s compound keys will in turn embed a priori knowledge from the lexicon in data-driven models derived from a corpus and enhance performance in machine learning. The lexicon is also humanoriented (de Schryver, 2003). ProPOSEL’s software tools are compatible with NLTK and enable users to define and search a subset of the lexicon and access entries by word class, phonetic transcription, syllable count and rhythmic structure. ProPOSEL was initially developed as a language engineering resource for use in our own research, but in the process of development we have also addressed several more general issues relating to cognitive aspects of the lexicon: the partial patterns in the mind of a dictionary user; the need for access and search by sound, rhythm, prosody, and also syntactic similarity; robust and stand</context>
