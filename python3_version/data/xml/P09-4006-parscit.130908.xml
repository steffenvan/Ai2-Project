<bodyText confidence="0.99975125">
In this paper, we introduce a multilingual ac-
cess and retrieval system with enhanced query
translation and multilingual document retrieval,
by mining bilingual terminologies and aligned
document directly from the set of comparable
corpora which are to be searched upon by us-
ers. By extracting bilingual terminologies and
aligning bilingual documents with similar con-
tent prior to the search process provide more
accurate translated terms for the in-domain
data and support multilingual retrieval even
without the use of translation tool during re-
trieval time. This system includes a user-
friendly graphical user interface designed to
provide navigation and retrieval of information
in browse mode and search mode respectively.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952842105263">
Query translation is an important step in the
cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).
Currently, most of the CLIR system relies on
various kinds of dictionaries, for example Word-
Nets (Luca and Nurnberger, 2006; Ranieri et al.,
2004), in query translation. Although dictionaries
can provide effective translation on common
words or even phrases, they are always limited in
the coverage. Hence, there is a need to expand
the existing collections of bilingual terminologies
through various means.
Recently, there has been more and more re-
search work focus on bilingual terminology ex-
traction from comparable corpora. Some promis-
ing results have been reported making use of sta-
tistics, linguistics (Sadat et al., 2003), translitera-
tion (Udupa et al., 2008), date information (Tao
and Zhai, 2005) and document alignment ap-
proach (Talvensaari et al., 2007).
In this paper, we introduce our Multilingual
Access and Retrieval System – MARS which
addresses the query translation issue by using in-
domain bilingual terminologies extracted directly
from the comparable corpora which are to be
accessed by users. And at the same time, bilin-
gual documents are paired up prior to the search
process based on their content similarities to
overcome the limitation of traditional keyword
matching based on the translated terms. These
would provide better retrieval experiences as not
only more accurate in-domain translated term
will be used to retrieve the documents but also
provide a new perspective of multilingual infor-
mation retrieval to process the time-consuming
multilingual document matching at the backend.
The following sections of this paper will de-
scribe the system architecture and the proposed
functionalities of the MARS system.

<bodyText confidence="0.999974777777778">
The MARS system is designed to enhance query
translation and document retrieval through min-
ing the underlying multilingual structures of
comparable corpora via a pivot language. There
are three reasons for using a pivot language.
Firstly, it is appropriate to use a universal lan-
guage among potential users of different native
languages. Secondly, it reduces the backend data
processing cost by just considering the pair-wise
relationship between the pivot language and any
other languages. Lastly, the dictionary resources
between the pivot language and all the other lan-
guages are more likely to be available than oth-
erwise.
There are two main parts in this system,
namely data processing and user interface. The
data processing is an offline process to mine the
underlying multilingual structure of the compa-

3 Data Processing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999705902439024">
For demo purpose, three different language
newspapers from the year 1995 to 2006 pub-
lished by Singapore Press Holding (SPH),
namely Strait Times1 (English), ZaoBao2 (Chi-
nese) and Berita Harian3 (Malay), are used as
comparable corpora. In these particular corpora,
English is chosen as the pivot language and noun
terms are chosen as the basic semantic unit as
they represent a huge amount of significant in-
formation. Our strategy is to organize and ma-
nipulate the corpora in three levels of abstraction
– clusters, documents and terms. And our key
task over here is to find the underlying associa-
tions of documents or terminologies in each level
across different languages.
First, monolingual documents are grouped into
clusters by k-means algorithm using simple word
vectors. Then, monolingual noun terms are ex-
tracted from each cluster using linguistic patterns
and filtered by occurrence statistics globally
(within cluster) and locally (within document), so
that they are good representatives for cluster as a
whole as well as individual documents (Vu et al.,
2008). The extracted terms are then used in
document clustering in a new cycle and the
whole process is repeated until the result con-
verges.
Next, cluster alignment is carried out between
the pivot language (English) and the other lan-
guages (Chinese, Malay). Clusters can be con-
ceptualized as the collection of documents with
the same themes (e.g. finance, politics or sports)
and their alignments as the correspondents in the
other languages. Since there may be overlaps
among themes, e.g. finance and economy, each
cluster is allowed to align to more than one clus-
ter with varying degree of alignment score.
After that, document alignment is carried out
between aligned cluster pairs (Vu et al., 2009).
Note that the corpora are comparable, thus the
aligned document pairs are inherently compara-

ble, i.e. they are similar in contents but not iden-
tical as translation pairs. Also as important to
note that, document alignment harvested over
here is independent of user query. In other
words, document alignment is not simply deter-
mined by mere occurrence of certain keyword
and its absence does not hinder documents to be
aligned. Hence mining of document alignment
beforehand improves document retrieval after-
ward.
Finally, term alignment is likewise generated
between aligned document pairs. The aligned
terms are expected to be in-domain translation
pairs since they are both derived from documents
of similar contents, and thus they have similar
contexts. By making use of the results provided
by each other, document alignment and term
alignment can be improved over iterations.
All the mentioned processes are done offline
and the results are stored in a relational database
which will handle online queries generated in the
user interface later on.

4 User Interface
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997225">
As mentioned, there are two modes provided in
the user interface to facilitate navigation and re-
trieval of information, namely browse mode and
search mode. Both modes can be switched sim-
ply by clicking on the respective tabs in the user
interface. In the following, the functionalities of
the browse mode and the search mode will be
explained in details.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987256">
4.1 Browse Mode
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955157894737">
Browse mode provides a means to navigate
through the complex structures underneath an
overwhelming data with an easily-understood,
user-friendly graphical interface. In the figure 1,
the graph in the browse mode gives an overall
picture of the distribution of documents in vari-
ous clusters and among the different language
collections. The outer circles represent the lan-
guage repositories and the inner circles represent
the clusters. The sizes of the clusters are depend-
ing on the number of contained documents and
the color represents the dominant theme. The
labels of the highlighted clusters, characterized
by a set of five distinguished words, are shown in
the tooltips next to them. By clicking on a clus-
ter, the links depicting the cluster alignments will
show up. The links to the clusters in the other
languages are all propagated through the pivot
language.

The right hand side of the browse panel pro-
vides the detail information about the selected
cluster using three sub-panels, i.e. top, middle
and bottom. The top panel displays a list of ex-
tracted terms from the selected cluster. User may
narrow down the list of interested terms by using
the search-text column on top. By clicking on a
term in the list, its translations in other lan-
guages, if any, will be displayed in the middle
sub-panel and the document containing the term
will be listed in the bottom sub-panel. The
“Search” buttons next to the term translations
provide a short-cut to jump to the search mode
with the corresponding term translation being cut
and pasted over. Last but not least, user may
simply click on any document listed in the bot-
tom sub-panel to read the content of the docu-
ment and its aligned documents in a pop-up win-
dow.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995949">
4.2 Search Mode
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980791666667">
Search mode provides a means for comprehen-
sive information retrieval. Refer to the figure 2,
user may enter query in any of the selected lan-
guages to search for documents in all languages.
The main difference is that query translation is
done via bilingual terms extracted via the term
alignment technology discussed earlier. For each
retrieved document, documents with similar con-
tent in the other languages are also provided to
supplement the searched results. This enables
documents which are potentially relevant to the
users be retrieved as some of these retrieved
documents may not contain the translated terms
at all.
On top of the query translation, other informa-
tion such as related terms and similar terms to
the query are shown at the tab panel on the right.
Related terms are terms that correlate statistically
with the query term and they are arranged by
cluster, separated by dotted line in the list. Simi-
lar terms are longer terms that contains the query
term in itself. Both the related terms and the
similar terms provide user additional hints and
guides to improve further queries.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948583333333">
The MARS system is developed to enable user to
better navigate and search information from mul-
tilingual comparable corpora in a user-friendly
graphical user interface. Query translation and
document retrieval is enhanced by utilizing the
in-domain bilingual terminologies and document
alignment acquired from the comparable corpora
itself, without limited by dictionaries and key-
word matching.
Currently, the system only support simple
query. Future work will improve on this to allow
more general query.

Since there may be overlaps among themes, e.g. finance and economy, each cluster is allowed to align to more than one cluster with varying degree of alignment sc</context>

Since there may be overlaps among themes, e.g. finance and economy, each cluster is allowed to align to more than one cluster with varying degree of alignment score. After that, document alignment is carried out between aligned cluster pairs (Vu et al., 2009).
