This paper focuses on generating referring expres-
sions capable of serving multiple communicative
goals. The components of a referring expression are
divided into a referring part and a non-referring part.
Two rules for the content determination and con-
struction of the non-referring part are given, which
are realised in an embedding algorithm. The signi-
ficant aspect of our approach is that it intends to gen-
erate the non-referring part given the restrictions im-
posed by the referring part, whose realisation is, on
the other hand, affected by the non-referring part.

1 Components of a Referring Expression
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99974650909091">
The referring expression is a very important and
complex construction in languages. It can serve
multiple communicative goals including referring to
an object, providing new information about it, and
expressing the speaker&apos;s emotional attitude towards
it (Appelt, 1985). Although a formal model of re-
ferring built within the framework of a general the-
ory of speech acts and rationality is given in (Appelt
and Kronfeld, 1987), and this can be used to explain
how referring acts achieve multiple goals, there is a
gap between the general model and the planning of
the linguistic content of a referring expression.
We divide the constituents in a referring ex-
pression 1 into two parts based on their com-
municative goals and the rules for their content
determination and realisation. They are a re-
ferring part, which intends to refer to an ob-
ject and a non-referring part, which intends to
provide additional new information about the ob-
ject. For example, in &amp;quot;the actual writing style of
Xuanzong, who was a well-known calligrapher&amp;quot;,
the bold faced items belong to the referring part, and
the underlined ones to the non-referring part.
The division is a pragmatic one and the two parts
are closely related to each other. On the one hand,
the referring part puts both syntactic and semantic

referring to physical objects are considered here.
constraints on the presenting of the non-referring
part. The syntactic constraint concerns mainly the
available syntactic slots around the head. The se-
mantic constraint will be introduced in section 3.
On the other hand, the possibility of adding a non-
referring part can make some realisations of a ref-
erent preferred over others. When generating re-
ferring expressions, multiple factors should be con-
sidered, which include Centering Theory (Grosz et
al., 1995) and stylistic preferences such as avoid-
ing too many repetitions. If we are to satisfy all
constraints to some extent, we may need to con-
sider more than one possible realisation of a refer-
ent, choosing among those that do not significantly
affect the coherence of the text. Then one of the
realisations that is most suitable for adding new in-
formation can be selected.
A great amount of work has been done on gener-
ating various types of referring expressions, which
addresses the referring part, while little has ad-
dressed the generation issues with respect to the
other part, except that in (Scott and de Souza, 1990),
the relation between embedding and rhetorical rela-
tions is discussed and several heuristics for combin-
ing sentences using embedding are given. But this
is far from enough for generating an appropriate re-
ferring expression.

2 System Architecture

<bodyText confidence="0.999693142857143">
We design an algorithm to generate referring ex-
pressions consisting of both parts. The referring part
is generated by the referring process (Dale, 1992),
while the non-referring part is generated by a sub-
type of the aggregation process called embedding,
which selects suitable facts and realises them as
components within the structure of a referring ex-
pression. The algorithm fits into the text planner of
ILEX (Oberlander etal., 1998).
ILEX is an adaptive hypertext system generating
museum object descriptions. In ILEX, pieces of do-
main knowledge that may be worth expressing in a
text are represented as nodes and links in a graph
called the Content Potential. Two kinds of nodes

useful for referring expression generation are entity
nodes and fact nodes2. A fact is represented as Pre-
dicate(Argl,Arg2). A revised version of Text Struc-
ture (TS) (Meteer, 1992) is used as an intermediate
level of representation between the text planner and
the sentence realiser, which provides syntactic con-
straints to the text planner while abstracting away
from linguistic details. The Text Structure uses a
unified representation for structures both above and
below sentence level, so that abstract sentence plan-
ning can be done in text planning.
The text generation process follows roughly four
steps: 1) The text planner selects a set of facts to be
expressed and the best rhetorical relations between
them3. 2) The text planner builds the TS for each
fact in the set. For each entity in a chosen fact,
the referring process produces a list of possible real-
isations that will unambiguously refer (the referring
part). Based on the constraints imposed by the re-
ferring part, the embedding process finds from the
set all the unexpressed facts whose Argls are that
entity&apos;&apos;, and makes embedding decisions including
what to embed, what syntactic form the embedded
parts should take and which realisation for the entity
is preferred, according to the principles in the next
section. This step iterates until the TS for all facts is
built. 3) The aggregation process goes through the
TS for parataxis possibilities. 4) The appropriately
simplified TS is sent to the surface realiser, where
the natural language text is generated.
We distinguish between two types of parataxis:
semantic and textual. Semantic parataxis concerns
facts that have two identical semantic constituents
or a rhetorical relation between them, while tex-
tual parataxis deals with any adjacent facts from text
planning, with no rhetorical connection between. In
step 3), both types of parataxis are performed.

3 Generating the Non-Referring Part
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914">
A referring expression is primarily for referring to
an entity. So the addition of a non-referring part
should not interfere with this primary function. We
summarise two principles that the non-referring part
must obey, which have been realised in our embed-
ding algorithm in a simple way.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.995832857142857">
2Each entity node corresponds to a domain object; each fact
node represents a relation between two entities and can be ex-
pressed as a single sentence in language.
3Details of the text planning algorithm can be found in
(Oberlander etal., 1998).
4The chosen fact actually forms the nucleus of Elaboration,
and the facts collected by embedding form the satellites.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99694656">
1. The non-referring part should not confuse
the reader about the referent indicated by the
referring part. That is, if the referring part can
uniquely identify the referent, the reader should not
be confused over which object the referring expres-
sion is about because of the addition of the non-
referring part. For example, in the description of a
currently focal object which is a necklace, we might
say &amp;quot;The necklace is made from gold&amp;quot;. Suppose
we also want to inform the readers that the necklace
has floral motifs. We should use &amp;quot;The necklace,
which has floral motifs, is made from gold&amp;quot; rather
than &amp;quot;The necklace with floral motifs is made from
gold&amp;quot; because the latter may make the readers think
that the sentence is about a necklace which is not
the focal object.
Based on both the properties of English and
our analysis of real museum descriptions, we find
that additional information is provided by evaluat-
ive adjectives, non-restrictive clauses, and almost
all grammatical constituents in an indefinite and a
demonstrative noun phrase. These characteristics
are captured by embedding rules. For example, the
definition of one rule that embeds a prepositional
phrase is:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.915382888888889">
(def-embed-rule
:name with-phrase ;the name of this rule
:priority 4
:type prep-phrase ;the type of embedding
:constraints
((:type pred Generalized-Possession)
(:type refer (:or demonstrative indefinite)))
:RT ((:rel-parent Adjunct)
(:textual-sem With-Prep-phrase)))
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999826052631579">
In the definition, priority is the order in which the
rule should be tried, where those rules producing
simpler syntactic forms always have higher prior-
ity (Scott and de Souza, 1990); constraints is the
restrictions that must be satisfied by the predicate
and arguments of the embedded fact and the real-
isation of the referring part. In the above example,
the required semantic category of the predicate is
specified, which is used to select suitable facts for
embedding; RT is the resource tree for building the
TS for the embedded component.
Assume we have two facts Fl =style(J1,Organic)
and F2=hasqual(J1,Floral-motif). Without using
embedding, we might generate &amp;quot;The necklace is in
the Organic style. It has floral motifs&amp;quot;. Suppose
Fl and F2 are selected by the text planner and the
embedding process respectively, and the referring
form of the entity J1 can be demonstrative, defin-
ite or pronoun. Applying the above embedding rule,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99111">

<bodyText confidence="0.965745833333333">
we would realise F2 as a post-modifier of the Arg 1
of F1, and choose demonstrative, as &amp;quot;This necklace
with floral motifs is in the Organic style&amp;quot;.
2. The non-referring part should not reduce
the readability of the text. There are several re-
strictions concerning readability:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.891775">
1) Complexity of a referring expression: the gen-
erated expressions should not be too complex to

<bodyText confidence="0.972528914893617">
read. We use a fixed number of syntactic slots to
restrict the maximum amount of information that
can be expressed. But the actual complexity is de-
cided by user models. At present we only distin-
guish between adults and children. According to
observations in psycholinguistic research, embed-
ded clauses in subjects are a major obstacle to com-
prehensibility (Coleman, 1962). So for children, the
system generates fewer non-restrictive clauses than
for adults and none at all in subjects.
2) Compatibility with other aggregation possibil-
ities: only semantic paratactic and hypotactic rela-
tions between facts are considered here. Complex
embedded components like non-restrictive clauses
may interrupt the semantic connection between a
set of sentences. For example, if we do not
consider such connections while making embed-
ding decisions, we would generate a sentence like:
&amp;quot;This jewel is made of gold, sapphire, a kind of
precious stone and enamel, which is often used to
produce a shiny surface&amp;quot;. It is not good compared
with: &amp;quot;This jewel is made of gold, sapphire and
enamel. Sapphire is a kind of precious stone, and
enamel is often used to produce a shiny surface&amp;quot;.
Adjectives would not have such negative effect
in most cases, especially when the paratactic parts
have syntactically symmetrical modifications, like
&amp;quot;The bracelet has a slightly flared band and a swell-
ing midsection.&amp;quot; Prepositional phrases fall between
adjectives and relative clauses in their effect.
Also when one fact is to be embedded, it is
necessary to check if there are facts semantic-
ally related to it, which should be embedded to-
gether. For instance, it is bad to say &amp;quot;The necklace,
which is made from gold, is in the Organic style. It
is also made from enamel&amp;quot;.
So before embedding a fact, our embedding al-
gorithm considers the possibilities of other types
of aggregation, and only embeds if the embedded
properties can be realised as a syntactic form other
than a non-restrictive clause in possible paratactic
nuclei, and all of the semantically related facts can
be embedded at the same time. This means that em-
bedding has a lower priority than parataxis and hy-
potaxis, which reflects the relationship between the
weakest rhetorical relation, Elaboration, and other
types of rhetorical relations.

4 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878">
This paper discusses our ongoing work on how
to embed new information into a referring expres-
sion. While the restrictions concerning the second
principle are currently implemented in a procedural
way, it is possible to formalise them as constraints
within the embedding rules.
An interesting problem is the relation between
embedding and entity-based coherence, which ex-
ists between spans of text in virtue of shared entities
(Oberlander et al., 1998). When a fact is embedded
into another one, the entity inside it may become un-
available for an entity-based move, and the smooth
transfer from this fact to its elaborating facts is cut
off. The effect of embedding on local and global co-
herence is to be exploited more in future work, and
a comprehensive evaluation is indispensable.

They are a referring part, which intends to refer to an object and a non-referring part, which intends to provide additional new information about the object. For example, in &amp;quot;the actual writing style of Xuanzong, who was a well-known calligrap</context>

There are several restrictions concerning readability: 1) Complexity of a referring expression: the generated expressions should not be too complex to read. We use a fixed number of syntactic slots to restrict the maximum amount of information that can be expressed. But the actual complexity is decided by user models. At present we only distinguish between adults and children. According to observations in psycholinguistic research, embedded clauses in subjects are a major obstacle to comprehensibility (Coleman, 1962). So for children, the system generates fewer non-restrictive clauses than for adults and none at all in subjects. 2) Compatibility with other aggregation possibilities: only semantic paratactic and hypotactic relations between facts are considered here. Complex embedded components like non-restrictive clauses may interrupt the semantic connection between a set of sentences. For example, if we do not consider such connections while making embedding decisions, we would generate a sentence like: &amp;quot;This jewel is made of gold, sapphire, a kind of precious stone and enamel, which is often used to pr</context>

But this is far from enough for generating an appropriate referring expression. 2 System Architecture We design an algorithm to generate referring expressions consisting of both parts. The referring part is generated by the referring process (Dale, 1992), while the non-referring part is generated by a subtype of the aggregation process called embedding, which selects suitable facts and realises them as components within the structure of a referring expression. The algorithm fits into the text planner of ILEX (Oberlander etal., 1998). ILEX is an adaptive hypertext system generating museum object descriptions. In ILEX, pieces of domain knowledge that may be worth expressing in a text are represented as nodes and links in a graph called the Content Potential. Two kinds of nodes 1478 useful for referring expression generation are entity nodes and</context>

In ILEX, pieces of domain knowledge that may be worth expressing in a text are represented as nodes and links in a graph called the Content Potential. Two kinds of nodes 1478 useful for referring expression generation are entity nodes and fact nodes2. A fact is represented as Predicate(Argl,Arg2). A revised version of Text Structure (TS) (Meteer, 1992) is used as an intermediate level of representation between the text planner and the sentence realiser, which provides syntactic constraints to the text planner while abstracting away from linguistic details. The Text Structure uses a unified representation for structures both above and below sentence level, so that abstract sentence planning can be done in text planning. The text generation process follows roughly four steps: 1) The text planner selects a set of facts to be expressed and the best rhetorical relations between them3. 2) The text planner builds the TS for each fact in the set.
