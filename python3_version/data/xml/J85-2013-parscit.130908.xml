CLEARINGHOUSE ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
SYSTEMS AND INTELLIGENT USER INTEFACES
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.997091611111111">
Batelle is currently conducting an industry-sponsored
analysis of intelligent user interfaces, in particular natural
language systems. The sponsors of this project are inter-
ested in assessing the state of the art of IUI/NLP and in
identifying ongoing research for possible funding.
An important part of this survey is the establishment
of a Clearinghouse hosted on a PC in dBase II format.
The Clearinghouse will allow researchers and companies
alike to access information about ongoing projects.
If you are currently working on a NLP or 0.11 project,
please let us know and we will send you our question-
naire. In return, we will make the result of the survey
available to you. As a further benefit, your project will
be included in upcoming publications (ACL, ACM, etc.)
related to the Clearinghouse.
We hope you will be able to cooperate and help us to
establish this needed network of people/projects in the
area of IUI/NLP.
