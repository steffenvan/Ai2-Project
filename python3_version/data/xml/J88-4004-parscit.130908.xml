The focus of the work is on providing a principled
account of lexical relations and classes, defining semantic
primitives in terms of the textual behaviour of words and
hence viewing them as embedded in their natural lan-
guage and not as elements of another, independent lan-
guage. (p. 1)

The book Synonymy and Semantic Classification by
Karen Sparck Jones was published in 1986 as the first
volume of Edinburgh Information Technology Series on
computer science and artificial intelligence. The book is
interesting both in its content and in some circum-
stances of its publication. The main part of the book
comprises Sparck Jones&apos;s Ph.D. thesis, approved at the
University of Cambridge as long ago as 1964. No
changes in the text of the thesis have been made for this
publication. All that has been added is a new chapter
entitled &amp;quot;Twenty years later: A review&amp;quot;, in which
Sparck Jones acts as her own reviewer and considers
her own work from the viewpoint of the results
achieved in linguistics during the past 20 years.
The book consists of seven chapters and two appen-
dices. It reflects the complex paths along which lin-
guists have to proceed when searching for the semantic
structure of a vocabulary, for semantic primitives, and
for the establishment of the parts they play in the
automatic process of natural language text understand-
ing.
To realize the idea of machine translation of natural
language texts, it is necessary, among other things, to
have a dictionary that makes it evident what meanings
each word-sign possesses, and to have a procedure for
recognizing the meaning in which the word-sign is used
in the context. For designing this kind of procedure, the
author considers it important that a discourse is con-
nected by one idea that recurs several times in the
discourse. It should be discovered what kind of infor-
mation is required to detect this idea. The author asks
the question as to whether the existing thesauri can
fulfill these requirements, and arrives at the conclusion
that they cannot. She suggests a different approach:
group all the elements of a vocabulary on the basis of
the interrelations the words have with each other and
define the meanings of words with the aid of these
interrelations.
The relations between words that a linguist stores in
the dictionary are supposed to be semantic relations
(i.e., relations between words), not factual relations
(i.e., extra-linguistic references of words). After study-
ing several types of relations (e.g., hyponymy, contrast,
likeness, implication), the author arrives at the conclu-
sion that synonymy as the exemplar of likeness of
meaning is a semantic relation because it is dependent
on the way in which the mechanism of using signs is
functioning. It is therefore possible, on the basis of
synonymy, to define the idea of the semantic structure
of a vocabulary. The author gives analyses of several
existing definitions of synonymy; however, she does
not find them quite suitable for designing machine
translation dictionaries and suggests a definition of her
own, which is linked with the terms sentence, length of
the sentence, ploy (a primitive notion, representing
roughly the meaning, application, and form of a sen-
tence), row (a set of elements that can replace one
another with respect to a position n in a sentence s„
without changing its ploy), word-sign, word-use, and
word: &amp;quot;Two or more word-uses&apos; are synonymous, and
therefore form a row, if their word-signs are mutually
replaceable at some position in some sentence, without
any change in the ploy of the sentence&amp;quot; (p. 71). To each
word-use it is possible to assign one and only one row
consisting of all the word-signs mutually replaceable in
a context, hence synonymous. Let us take, for example,
word-signs A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and let us consider
word uses represented by the word-sign A. We may
find, for instance, that A has three word uses charac-
terized by three rows:

This notation means that the first word-use of word-sign
A can be replaced by the word-signs B and C in a certain
context; the second word-use can be replaced by the
word-sign D, and in the third word-use, it can be
replaced by the word-signs E, F, and G. If the word-sign
A acquires a new word-use, a new row is included in its
set of rows. Thus, if we operate with the concept of row
we can define precisely a total synonymy of two word-
uses, a likeness of two word-uses, a similarity of two
rows and a connectivity of two word-signs.

Book Reviews Reasoning and Discourse Processes
This definition of synonymy provides us with a tool
to relate the words in the vocabulary of a language to
one another, and, hence, a tool with the aid of which we
can define all the word-uses of each word-sign simply
and in a form allowing comparisons of definitions. It can
be objected that if this approach is applied to special
vocabulary (technical and scientific terminology) in
which synonymy is rare, the definitions of word-uses
will often remain empty. The author analyzes various
potential classifications of sets of synonyms (sets of
rows) enabled by the synonymy definition, as well as
the possibilities of their groupings. She finds a few ways
of row grouping resulting in conceptual groupings sim-
ilar to those found in thesauri. She made a computer
experiment whose aim was to find out whether the
suggested procedure of grouping is practicable for the
natural language vocabulary. She selected 21 word-
signs and, on the basis of information about them
contained in the Oxford English Dictionary, assigned
500 rows to them (given in her Appendix 2). With aid of
the computer, she tried to establish groupings similar to
those in thesauri. The results have been satisfactory in
part only. After modifying classification criteria, the
author intended to carry out a new experiment involving
about 2,000 rows. The results of that experiment were
not mentioned in the chapter &amp;quot;Twenty years later&amp;quot;.
Sparck Jones is looking for an answer to the question
as to why we expect to find synonyms in natural
languages. She arrives at the conclusion that synonymy
is not a mere redundance and that it exists because, in
the extra-linguistic world, we encounter situations that
are unique, but, at the same time, similar to each other
in certain aspects. Synonymy reflects this fact; other-
wise language would be an inadequate representation of
the extra-linguistic world. She gives four models of the
way linguistic symbols are set up and she claims that her
Model 4 is the one that represents natural language:
Model 4:
a. A word-use may have more than one sign;
b. Two or more word-uses may have the same sign, where
these word-uses are similar. (p. 135)
It remains unclear why also homonymy, which is in-
cluded in her Model 2 and which does constitute a
language relation, is not dealt with in Model 4, and why
the word homonymy is never used in the book.
The book exemplifies an excellent way the efforts
made to solve practical problems in computational
linguistics bring new and promising knowledge in a field
of linguistic theory. The rendering of the subject has a
solid, logical structure; it is clear and systematic. The
text is not burdened with the artificial linguistic termi-
nology that flooded the linguistic publications of the
sixties. It can be regretted that the book was not
published at the time of its origin. Even for the present
time, however, it yields a number of suggestions for
linguistic research.

Reasoning and Discourse Processes is a collection of
papers in the Cognitive Science series of Academic
Press. The authors are largely from psychology and
linguistics departments in the U.K. and Europe.
The book begins with a brief preface, which clearly sets
out the theme of the book: exploring the relation
between verbal reasoning and discourse, with an aim of
contributing to an adequate theory of natural language
processing. The very first chapter of the book, written
by the editors, serves to describe how the different
authors address the theme mentioned in the preface.
This chapter is an excellent summary of the upcoming
chapters, providing the reader with an index into those
parts of the book of most interest to his/her own
research.
The editors divide the papers into two main topics:
forms of representation and the role of inference for
reasoning within discourse. The first six chapters dis-
cuss representation: &amp;quot;whether rules of inference for-
malized in a logical calculus adequately characterize the
deductive component of the verbal reasoning capac-
ity&amp;quot;. The remaining chapters are primarily concerned
with characterizations of coherence; these consider-
ations may introduce a deductive component into dis-
course.
The book thus addresses issues of concern to com-
putational linguists. Constructing models for the proc-
essing of natural language requires considerations both
of the form of the representation and the inferencing
