In the rush to carry on the work
of the information age, it is wise for
computer professionals to regularly
look back at the beginnings of the
computer revolution.
While viewing the history of com-
puters may seem a luxury in the face
of an ever-changing environment, it
is surprising how rich this history is
in terms of wheels already invented
and common problems already solved.
It is also ironic that many computer
professionals—who have dedicated
themselves to processing information
at a rapid speed to save time for end
users—avoid sitting back and pon-
dering the historic value of their work.
The American Federation of In-
formation Processing Societies, Inc.,
has a publication that can provide a
valuable window to yesterday.

Computing&apos;s &amp;quot;roots&amp;quot;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999594419354839">
The Annals of the History of
Computing is a documentation of the
&amp;quot;roots&amp;quot; of this relatively new profes-
sion.
This unique publication appears
four times a year, with contributors
exploring the evolution of the com-
puter and the people who have as-
sisted in its development and accept-
ance within business and society.
There are numerous advantages to
being a regular reader of the Annals
of the History of Computing.
For example, time spent perusing
the Annals provides a valuable insight
into the information mangement
profession and its future directions.
In addition, reading about the prim-
itive technologies designed by the
pioneers in the field can be an amus-
ing experience in light of what is
known today.
However, and more important, if
computer professionals cast away the
advantage of hindsight and put them-
selves into those early environments
of discovery, these professionals then
build an affinity with their predeces-
sors—and they develop more creative
approaches to the problems of proc-
essing information.

Contemporary solutions

<bodyText confidence="0.999752028571429">
In short, what numerous readers
of the Annals of the History of Com-
puting are finding out is that there
are solutions to contemporary prob-
lems to be found in the historic review
of the field and its early leaders.
&amp;quot;Just as we look to the historian of
government for a better understand-
ing of government, and to the his-
torian of art for a better understanding
of art, so we are entitled to look to
the historian of technology for a better
understanding of technology.&amp;quot; That
view belongs to management con-
sultant Peter Drucker, in an article
which appears in the October 1982
Annals.
For those people who see history
as the happenings of men and women
thousands of years ago, the history of
computers may seem to be rushing
things a bit.
Since the field emerged only about
35 years ago, any attempt at creating
a historic perspective might appear.
premature. Yet, the historic analysis
of the profession&apos;s work, as published
in the Annals, among other maga-
zines and books, is one vehicle which
will aid in the maturing of the profes-
sion as well as its visibility with the
public.
It is time to reflect on the potent
history of the computer and its ability
to process information.

Guidelines for Submissions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.897963">
Manuscripts submitted to COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS should be typed on letter-size
paper (8.5 by 11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and
references. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately
150-250 words. Manuscripts must be submitted in English.
</bodyText>
<note confidence="0.576863">
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories:
</note>
<figureCaption confidence="0.942423173913043">
PAPER: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in
computational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular
topic. The length of a paper depends on its content, but we suggest that manuscripts be
limited to forty double-spaced pages. That is the equivalent of twelve journal pages.
Each paper is fully refereed, being read by at least two members of the editorial board and
usually by an additional expert in the particular subject area.
The submission of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies the
manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to
another refereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a
non-refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the
Editor at the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for
publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the
authors or, in the case of a &amp;quot;work for hire&amp;quot;, by the employer. This written transfer is
necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law.
TECHNICAL CORRESPONDENCE: This category includes short articles reporting
preliminary results of some project in progress, or the results of other studies of interest
to the readership. Technical correspondences should not generally exceed eight double-
spaced pages. Each technical correspondence is reviewed by at least two members of the
editorial board before acceptance.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: This includes statements of opinion on issues relevant to the
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these
contributions for inclusion.
Five copies of papers, technical correspondences, and letters should be sent to the Editor:
