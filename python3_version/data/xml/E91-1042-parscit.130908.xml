Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9994156">
In the field of knowledge based systems for natural lan-
guage processing, one of the most challenging aims is
to use parts of an existing knowledge base for differ-
ent domains and/or different tasks. We support the
point that this problem can only be solved by using ad-
equate metainformation about the content and struc-
turing principles of the representational systems con-
cerned. One of the prerequisites in this respect is the
transparency of modelling decisions.
After a short introduction to our scenario, we will
propose general dimensions for characterizing knowl-
edge in knowledge based systems. These dimensions
will be differentiated according to linguistic levels of
investigation in order to deduce structuring principle,
for the modelling process. The resulting criteria will be
evaluated in a detailed erample taken from our proto-
typical implementation.
We hope to contribute some promising steps towards
a methodology of knowledge engineering with natural
language and common sense orientation.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997327470588235">
In the following, we want to sketch first results of
knowledge engineering research which was under-
taken for the LILOG project (Linguistic and logic
methods). LILOG develops concepts for natural
language systems for text understanding. Major
results are available in a prototype system LEU/2&apos;
(LILOG Experimentier- Umgebung)2.
In order to reduce the complexity of the system,
it has to be decomposed into modules.
&apos;Leu/2 is being developped at IBM Germany in coopera-
tion with some university partners, and is fully implemented
in Prolog under AIX. The knowledge base for the domain un-
der investigation consists of about 600 concept definitions,
among these some 100 belonging to the upper structure.
The number of attributes for each of these concepts aver-
ages around 20. At this time the number of axioms for our
domain is approximately 300.

Our approach embodies modules oriented to-
wards levels of linguistic investigation like morphol-
ogy, syntax and semantics. In addition the modules
differentiate between analysis and the generation
processes. In the ideal case, all processes and mod-
ules will be supported by commonsense knowledge.
A crucial problem in this context is the construc-
tion of an adequate background knowledge base.
The: need for a methodology is obvious. First steps
have been made in expert system research, where
both domain anditask are for the most part clearly
specifiable. This does not hold for systems with
natural language - and conunon sense orientation.
In what follows, we will outline the knowledge en-
gineering approach in LILOG along three dimen-
sions.
Task:
Domain and texts were selected in order to cover
a wide variety of linguistic phenomena to be han-
dled by the linguistic parts of the system (i.e. pars-
ing:and generating components). In order to prove
the,appropriate understanding of the texts, the ar-
chitecture was designed no. as a question/answer
system. Hence, we get the additional task to gen-
erate language.

For LEU/ 2, the domain was restricted to
travel guide information about the city center of
Diisseldorf. As a first step, a set of written data was
obtained by travel guides, supplemented by travel
agencies and a local inspection of Düsseldorf city
center.
The set of different entities was to meet the fol-
loWing condition&apos;s: it should be large enough for a
relevant size of the knowledge base, interconnected
enough to allow for interesting inferences but at the
same time small enough for being handled within
a prototypical implementation.
We decided to work with a couple of short texts
(frequently found in travel guides), which describe
- 239 -
particular sightseeing items, and a one page narra-
tive text about a group of people on a prototypical
sightseeing tour. In the next step, the chosen texts
were classified according to linguistic criteria and
analyzed for their propositional contents.
Granularity:
In order to obtain a first hint at the variety
of text understanding tasks whic.h LEU/2 was in-
tended to deal with, native speakers were asked to
formulate questions and to provide acceptable an-
swers concerning the contents of the texts.
The selection of items and the way these native
speakers talked about them, served as guideline to
determine an appropriate granularity of the knowl-
edge base.
The overall performance of the system is deter-
mined by the interaction of its components. Due
to the modular approach, the relevant subtasks of
the knowledge base had to be separated from those
of the lexical, syntactic, semantic analysis compo-
nents and the generation module. As a result of
this preliminary investigation, three dimensions
of knowledge turned out to be crucial to the mod-
elling process.

2 Dimensions of Knowledge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999742142857143">
We will discuss knowledge from two different per-
spectives. On the one hand we have those condi-
tions which lead to qualitative requirements con-
cerning the contents of the knowledge base. The
other perspective concerns aspects induced by for-
mal devices, i.e. the knowledge representation for-
malism used.

2.1 Qualitative Dimensions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992927117647059">
If you consider knowledge representation as a spe-
cial case of model theory, you will get a hint of how
to proceed. As to the breadth of the model, the first
dimension at issue, this meant:
The job of the representing world is to reflect
sonic aspects of the represented world in some
fashion.[Palmer, 1978]
As regarding granularity, the second dimension,
a model reflects only a subset of the characteristics
of the entities it represents. This, in turn, deter-
mines the depth of the model.
A third dimension is given:by the complexity of
the task the model is intended to cover.
All three dimensions are shown in picture 1.
Some of the consequences for the model in
LILOG following from this view of knowledge rep-
resentation are described below.

ing systems, there is some controversy on the design
and use of formal constructs. Topics in this de-
bate are the function of axioms compared to recent
expert system technology, the function of struc-
tured concept hierarchies [Monarch and Nirenburg,
1987], the quality and number of additional at-
tributes (roles in KL-ONE like systems) or syn-
tactic validation Criteria [Horacek, 1989]. Our ap-
proach aims at finding useful selectional criteria for
different expressive means of the formalism Lumoo
in order to bridge the actual gap between problem
driven and technology driven 3 research.
We can make .use of two kinds of formal con-
structs:
• A frame-description language similar to KL-
ONE (cf. e.g. [Brachman and Schmolze,
1985]), which serves to represent the terminol-
ogy of the domain by means of
— sort expressions for classes of entities, or-
ganized hierarchically as sets and subsets
(i.e. the logical subsumption relation),
and
7 two place predicates and functions (i.e.
features and roles), attached to specific
sorts and constituting functional and re-
lational connections between sorts, and
• axioms of first order predicate logic, express-
ing inferential dependencies between domain
terms in form of the axiomatic semantics for
those terms.
So the formalism used here4 is comparable to e.g.
KRYPTON (s.e.g. [Brachman et al., 1985D.
In the following, we will discuss the qualitative
dimensions of knowledge in more detail. We will fo-
cus the qualitative criteria by differentiating them
according to our scenario.
See [Lehnert, 1988j for that distinction.

3 Criteria for Structuring the

3.1 Demands Resulting from the
Task
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996401833333333">
As mentioned above, the task of our system is to
simulate text understanding. This requires a trans-
fer of insights from linguistic research into knowl-
edge engineering. In the ideal case, structures of
the model will be strongly influenced by natural
language analyses.
Linguistic knowledge is relevant in various re-
spects:
• Word orientation, for. example, implies
close interrelationships with research on lexical
knowledge: affiliated generic terms, discrimi-
nating features, idiosyncratic aspects of use,
etc. However, you may run into difficulties by
relating syntactic categories (like word classes)
with conceptual structures. So thematic roles
cannot be directly transformed into ontological
roles as a part of the background knowledge.
In the sentence
The bus took the participants of the
conference to the city center.&apos;
the &apos;bus&apos; is an agent of an event from the syn-
tactic point of view and at the same time con-
ceptualized as instrument (and not agent) of
an event in an ontological sense.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.69098">
• Sentence oriented linguistic investigation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.978464305555555">
implies the reconstruction of knowledge on
the sentence level, as opposed to the mean-
ing of single words or of textual structures.
As an illustration might serve temporal in-
formation about the progress of actions or
situations. Theoretical woik in this field
was initiated e.g. by Z. Vendler IVendler,
1967] with his analysis of verbs and times.
His differentiation of states, activities, accom-
plishments and achievements has been estab-
lished as a well known classification of verbs.
One important criterion for this distinction is
the goal-orientedness of the concerned verbs:
states and activities are by definition not
goal-oriented, whereas accomplishments and
achievements are goal-oriented in a temporally
extended or punctual way, respectively.
The aspect of goal-orientedness turned out to
be central in our domain, e.g. as to directional
verbs of movement. The sentence
The tourists took the bus to the Rhine
and went for a boat trip.&amp;quot;
II The German version of the sentence is part of the text
corpus of LEU/2: &amp;quot;Der Bus brochte die Teilueluner der Kon-
fetes*. in die Innensiadi&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;Die Touristen nalunen den Bus bis stun Rhein unci
machien einen Bootsausflug.&amp;quot;
allows to infer by default that the tourists
reached their goal (the Rhine), because the lo-
cation of the following event (the boat trip) is
the same as the arrival point of the bus ride.
By introducing goal-orientedness as a part of
the definition of events, it will hence be possi-
ble to give an affirmative answer to the ques-
tion
Were the tourists at the Rhine?&apos;

course oriented information. Text under-
standing phenomena like anaphora resolution
can only be accounted by accessing back-
ground knowledge concerning interconceptual
relation.
The tourists went for a boat trip. They
took the seats on the sundeck.°
In order to capture the meaning of these sen-
tences, three steps have to be inferred: A boat
trip is usually undertaken with a boat; a boat
often has a sundeck; and a sundeck mostly of-
fers seats.

3.2 Demands Resulting from the
Domain
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998667380952381">
In the LEU/2 context, we have to deal with the
comprehensive task of text understanding and
a relatively narrow domain. Consequently, the
general problem of conceptualization is lim-
ited by a restricted number of entities relevant
to our field. Modelling these entities includes
both the selection of concepts which appear
in the domain, and the plausible combination
and summing of recurrent concepts. The plau-
sibility of modelling decisions in this sense can
be judged from an engineering point of view in
terms of optimizing search space (system per-
formance) and from a philosophical point of
view in terms of the principle of economy of
the ontology:
The concepts RBSTAURATION, CONSTRUCTION
and RBNOVATION may serve as an illustration
taken from Our domain. As they share similar
aspects and inferences, we decided to intro-
duce the suPersort MODIFICATION (see section
4).

3.3 Granularity: Depth of Mod-
elling and Inferencing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95991030952381">
In the third qualitative dimension of knowl-
edge we have to face the problem of delimi-
tating the depth of the model in order to re-
duce complexity. As it is not possible to give

- 241 -
an exhaustive system of categories&amp;quot;, it Seems
legitimate to determine primitive concepts de-
pendent on the chosen task and domain. In
addition, selectional criteria for clusters Of in-
ferences have to be determined. (See example
in section 4). As a possibility of measuring
the depth of a model, Hayes ([Hayes, 1979])
proposed a ratio of axioms per concept.
Aside from measuring the expression of dimen-
sions of knowledge by menus of quantitative
data, it is important to consider qualitative de-
pendencies between the depth and task Of the
model on the one hand and between the depth
and domain on the other.
Depth in relation to the task
Within the task of text understanding; some
requirements of representation are e.g.: goal
orientation, culmination, causal connections,
intention, etc. [Trabasso and Sperry, 1985].
In all these cases the chosen granularity has
strong impact upon the resolution of interre-
lations in the texts.&apos;&amp;quot;
Depth in relation to the domain
This connection can be illustrated by the fol-
lowing example: A typical event of our domain
is RBSTAURATION. In our scenario, touristic
aspects like the architect (agent), the time and
the object concerned (e.g., the facade) will be
of crucial importance. Given a different sce-
nario like the protection of historical .monu-
ments, we would have to face an interest in
considerably more details, requiring the choice
of a deeper granularity.

In this section, we first want to give a brief sur-
vey of the ontology. After that, we will take
up the sorts and regularities mentioned so far
and present a structured exemplary model for-
malized in LuLoG .
Sort expressions are used to represent the cate-
gories of our domain model. The upper struc-
ture of the resulting ontology portrays some
generalized schemes of organization of relative
domain-independence. When descending the
model towards the lower structure, the cate-
gories are defined much closer to the word level
and therefore domain-specific in the sense of
explicit text knowledge.

This differentiation between upper and lower structure
of the model is introduced by (Mann et al., 1985).
texts, i.e. short texts describing single sight-
seeing items and narrative texts dealing with
sequences of events. This lends us to the re-
quirement of both an object-oriented and an
event-oriented part of the conceptual hierar-
chy.
Consequently, one of our basic design decisions
is due to 1 Hobbs (cf. [Hobbs et al., 1987])
and results in a reification of predicates. So in
our model all events, states etc. have concept
status on their own.
This technique enables us to model the case
frames for verbs in an analogical manner to the
lexical entries of the analyzing component as
well as to incorporate the structures for events
etc. within the categories alike the definitions
for objects.121 It makes sense to think about
objects as well as about events in terms of their
spatial and temporal environment, although
these knowledge specifications will obviously
be quite different.
An example taken from the event cluster may
serve as an illustration of several consequences
of the criteria mentioned above. As to the
breadth of .the model, the relevance of the
event part or the ontology appears intuitively
plausible with respect to our domain, namely
a scenario of cities, with modifying events. We
have to deal with sights of the city like facades
of important,buildings, and the events of mod-
ification related to them show a considerable
resemblance &apos;of important features of meaning
— although the verbs are no real synonyms in
the linguistic sense.
Figure 2 shows a screen dump with the rele-
vant part of the concept hierarchy. The pic-
ture illustrates the effect of bundling that the
introduction:: of adequate superconcepts has,
and which allows for structured inferencing in
terms of system efficiency. In this part of our
concept hierarchy the boarderline between Up-
per Structure and Lower Structure is clearly
identifiable. When descending the hierarchy,
the sort KONSTRUKTIVSIT fans out into sev-
eral domain-dependent subsorts.
The figure is followed by the respective sort
expressions written in the LuLoG list struc-
ture(the sort KONSTRUKTIVSIT in the figure
corresponds to CONSTRUCTION in the English
list of sort expressions), expanded by roles and
features which do not appear in the graphic
representation. It should be noted here that
a third kind of information is omitted even in
the list notation. More general roles and fea-
tures (like e.g. agent, time and so on) are in-
herited by superconcepts and not visible in nei-
ther presentation. (The short line in the upper
left corner of some concept boxes indicate the
existence of&apos; additional hidden superconcepts.)
&amp;quot;A similiar technique you can find e.g. in [Mann et al.,
19851.

The definition of the relevant event concepts in
LL/LoG is followed by an axiom which trans-
fers information about the time of a construc-

concerned object. This kind of structured
modelling allows to dispense with writing sim-
ilar axioms for a number of resembling events.
In order to demonstrate task orientation, it
would be necessary to consider a broader part
of the ontology, because aspects like intention,
causality or culmination have been modelled
separately. In addition, one would have to take
a closer look at the ensemble of connected com-
ponents in the system. The limitation of the
depth of the model can be seen from the fact
that the event concepts discussed do not have
more differentiated subconcepts and, of course,
from the fact that not all possible roles and
features have been integrated into the model.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99898692">
One of the most discussed topics in the field of
text understanding is the separation between
semantic knowledge on the one hand and com-
mon sense knowledge or world knowledge on
the other. During the conception and imple-
mentation of the modules in our prototype,
this discussion was reflected by a considerable
flexibility in the division of functions between
semantic analysis and inferential processes.
During the integration, descriptive parts of lin-
guistic theories had to be completed with pro-
cedural or functional aspects. Typical Misfits
appeared each time it was clear what should
be ezpressed within certain modules (like mor-
phology or syntax), but it was unclear how to
proceed from one module to the next. In the
ideal case, this allowed for conclusions on in-
compatibilities between the levels of linguistic
analysis corresponding to the respective mod-
ules.
One of these phenomena is the identification of
adjectival passive constructions versus regular
verb:

According to Vendler&apos;s classification; open

sentence and, combined with to be in the sec-
ond case, as a state. The integration: of the
modules showed that none of the system com-
ponents was able to deliver this differentiation
- in this case, the reason was the incompati-
bility between unsorted unification grammars
and the necessity to overwrite default values.
In the field of Knowledge Engineering, the
question how to make contents of one knowl-
edge base available to a second one (normally
with quite another kind of task setting) has
been receiving growing attention. One of the
most interesting parts of this problem Consists
in the interrelationship between common sense
- and domain specific knowledge. We hope to
contribute some important steps towards han-
dling this problem by making explicit a num-
ber of common sense oriented modelling deci-
sions within the LILOG context. It is Obvious,
though, that both background knowledge for
natural language processing and the adequate
implementation of metainformation for knowl-
edge base contents will be an ongoing affair for
the next years.

<abstract confidence="0.9997723">In the field of knowledge based systems for natural language processing, one of the most challenging aims is to use parts of an existing knowledge base for different domains and/or different tasks. We support the point that this problem can only be solved by using adequate metainformation about the content and structuring principles of the representational systems concerned. One of the prerequisites in this respect is the transparency of modelling decisions.</abstract>
