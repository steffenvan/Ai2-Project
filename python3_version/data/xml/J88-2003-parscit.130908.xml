A semantics of temporal categories in language and a theory of their use in defining the temporal
relations between events both require a more complex structure on the domain underlying the meaning
representations than is commonly assumed. This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as
causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. A central notion in the ontology
is that of an elementary event-complex called a &amp;quot;nucleus.&amp;quot; A nucleus can be thought of as an association
of a goal event, or &amp;quot;culmination,&amp;quot; with a &amp;quot;preparatory process&amp;quot; by which it is accomplished, and a
&amp;quot;consequent state,&amp;quot; which ensues. Natural-language categories like aspects, futurates, adverbials, and
when-clauses are argued to change the temporal/aspectual category of propositions under the control of
such a nucleic knowledge representation structure. The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role
in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and
Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category. We claim that any manageable formalism for natural-
language temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal
database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999799">
It is often assumed that the semantics of temporal
expressions is directly related to the linear time concept
familiar from high-school physics—that is, to a model
based on the number line. However, there are good
reasons for suspecting that such a conception is not the
one that our linguistic categories are most directly
related to. When-clauses provide an example of the
mismatch between linguistic temporal categories and a
semantics based on such an assumption. Consider the
following examples, suggested by Ritchie 1979:

<bodyText confidence="0.999854">
To map the temporal relations expressed in these ex-
amples onto linear time, and to try to express the
semantics of when in terms of points or intervals
(possibly associated with events), would appear to
imply either that when is multiply ambiguous, allowing
these points or intervals to be temporally related in at
least three different ways, or that the relation expressed

between main and when-clauses is one of approximate
coincidence. However, neither of these tactics explains
the peculiarity of utterances like the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.611087">
2. #When my car broke down, the sun set.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99943725">
The unusual character of this statement seems to arise
because the when-clause predicates something more
than mere temporal coincidence, that is, some contin-
gent relation such as a causal link or an enablement
relation between the two events. Our knowledge of the
world does not easily support such a link for (2), at least
if we don&apos;t indulge in the fiction that the natural
universe is conspiring against the speaker. Nor is the
relation predicated between the two events by when the
one that we normally think of as scientifically causal,
for when seems to predicate an intransitive relation.
Consider:

b. When Sue cried, her mother got upset.
c. When John left, Sue&apos;s mother got upset.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999512571428571">
From (3a) and (b) it would be unwarranted to conclude
the state of affairs that is described in (c). And this
causal aspect of the sentence&apos;s meaning must stem from
the sense-meaning of when, because parallel utterances
using while, just after, at approximately the same time
as, and the like, which predicate purely temporal coin-
cidence, are perfectly felicitous.
We shall claim that the different temporal relations
conveyed in examples (1) and (2) do not arise from any
sense-ambiguity of when, or from any &amp;quot;fuzziness&amp;quot; in
the relation that it expresses between the times referred
to in the clauses it conjoins, but from the fact that the
meaning of when is not primarily temporal at all. Nor is
it simply causal, as Example 3 shows. We will argue
instead that when has a single sense-meaning, reflecting
its role of establishing a temporal focus, which we
follow Isard and Longuet-Higgins (1973) in relating to
Reichenbach&apos;s reference time (cf. introduction to this
collection). The apparent diversity of meanings arises
from the nature of this referent and the organisation of
events and states of affairs in episodic memory under a
relation we shall call contingency, a term related, but not
identical to a notion like causality, rather than mere
temporal sequentiality. This contingent, nontemporal
relation on the representation of events in episodic
memory also determines the ontology of propositions
associated with linguistic expressions denoting events
and states. It is to these that we turn first.

2 TEMPORAL AND ASPECTUAL CATEGORIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99936952631579">
Propositions conveyed by English sentences uttered in
context can, following Vendler, be classified into tem-
poral or aspectual types, partly on the basis of the
tenses, aspects, and adverbials with which they can
co-occur (cf. Dowty 1979, and the introduction to the
present collection). The term aspectual type refers to the
relation that a speaker predicates of the particular
happening that their utterance describes, relative to
other happenings in the domain of the discourse. What
the speaker says about those relations is of course quite
distinct from what those relations objectively are. In
particular, the speaker&apos;s predications about events will
typically be coloured by the fact that those events are
involved in sequences that are planned, predicted,
intended, or otherwise governed by agencies of one
kind or another. For want of some established term to
cover this very general class of dependencies between
events, we will use the term contingency. Thus an
utterance of
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.817658">
4. Harry reached the top
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999772083333333">
is usually typical of what we will call a culmination—
informally, an event which the speaker views as punc-
tual or instantaneous, and as accompanied by a transi-
tion to a new state of the world.&apos; This new state we will
refer to as the consequent state of the event. It does not
necessarily include all events that are objectively and in
fact consequences. It rather includes only those conse-
quences that the speaker views as contingently related
to other events that are under discussion, say by
causing them or by permitting them to occur. For
reasons that are discussed in Section 3.2 below, expres-
sions like these readily combine with the perfect, as in
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.487014">
5. Harry has reached the top.

<bodyText confidence="0.9991245">
The point may perhaps best be made by noting that
there is another class of punctual expressions that is not
normally associated with a consequent state. For exam-
ple,
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.802189" genericHeader="introduction">
6. John hiccupped
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97857245">
is not usually viewed as leading to any relevant change
in the state of the world. It typifies what we call a point
expression. A point is an event (not necessarily an
instantaneous one) that is viewed as an indivisible
whole and whose consequences are not at issue in the
discourse—which of course does not mean that de facto
consequences do not exist. Such expressions are evi-
dently not the same as culminations, for they are rather
odd in combination with the perfect, as in
7. # Harry has hiccupped.
The reasons for this will also be discussed below.
Sentences like
8. Harry climbed
typify a third aspectual category, which we will call for
obvious reasons a process. Most utterances of such
sentences describe an event as extended in time but not
characterised by any particular conclusion or culmina-
tion. As was pointed out by Vendler, expressions like
these can be combined with afor-adverbial but not with
an in-adverbial:

9. Harry climbed for several hours.
#Harry climbed in several hours.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.873922761904762">
In contrast,
10. Harry climbed to the top
typically describes a state of affairs that also extends in
time but that does have a particular culmination asso-
ciated with it at which a change of state takes place. We
classify most utterances of such sentences as a fourth
aspectual type, called a culminated process. Culminated
processes, in contrast to ordinary processes, combine
readily with an in-adverbial but not with afor-adverbial.
11. Harry climbed all the way to the top in less than 45
minutes.
#Harry climbed all the way to the top for less than
45 minutes.
All of the above categories describe what common
sense suggests we call events—that is, happenings with
defined beginnings and ends. We distinguish these
&amp;quot;hard-edged&amp;quot; categories from a class of indefinitely
extending states of affairs, which, equally commonsen-
sically, we call states. Example 12 typically describes
one kind of state:
12. Harry is at the top.
Part of the appeal of Vendler&apos;s account, and such
descendants as the present proposal, is that it suggests
that part of the meaning of any utterance of a sentence
is one of a small number of temporal/aspectual profiles
distinguished on a small number of dimensions. In
present terms, the event-types can be distinguished on
just two dimensions, one concerned with the contrast
between punctuality and temporal extension, the other
with the association with a consequent state. This
subcategorisation can be summarized as in Figure 1.

We have included in Figure 1 examples of verbs which
typically yield propositions of the relevant types, and
we shall assume that such verbs (or, strictly speaking,
the associated uninstantiated propositions) are lexically
specified as bearing that type. However, it cannot be
stressed too often that these aspectual profiles are
properties of sentences used in a context: sense-mean-
ings of sentences or verbs in isolation are usually
compatible with several (or even all possible) Vendle-
rian profiles, as Dowty and Verkuyl have pointed out—
hence the frequent use of words like &amp;quot;typically&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;readily&amp;quot; above. The details of this taxonomy and the
criteria according to which utterances can be catego-
rised are less important than the observation that each
primitive entity of a given type, such as the culmination
event of Harry&apos;s reaching the top, carries intimations of
other associated events and states, such as the process
by which the culmination was achieved and the conse-
quent state that followed. What linguistic devices like
tenses, aspects, and temporal/aspectual adverbials ap-
pear to do is to transform entities of one type into these
other contingently related entities, or to turn them into
composites with those related entities.
For example, we shall argue below that the progres-
sive auxiliary demands that its argument be a process,
which it predicates as ongoing. If it is combined with an
event type that isn&apos;t a process, say with a punctual
event as in Harry was hiccupping, then it will cause that
original event to be reinterpreted as a process, in this
case the process of iteration or repetition of the basic
event. Similarly, we shall argue that a perfect auxiliary
demands a culmination, predicating of the time referred
to that the associated consequent state holds. The
notion of &amp;quot;time referred to&amp;quot; is related to Reichenbach&apos;s
reference time in Section 4.1 below. If the perfect is
combined with an event description for which world
knowledge provides no obvious culmination, then the
ensemble will tend to be anomalous. So, for example,
Harry has reached the top is fine, but The clock has
ticked, and Harry has hummed, to the extent that they
are acceptable at all, seem to demand rather special
scenarios in which the tick of the clock and the mere act
of humming have a momentousness that they usually
lack.
The phenomenon of change in the aspectual type of a
proposition under the influence of modifiers like tenses,
temporal adverbials, and aspectual auxiliaries is of
central importance to the present account. We shall talk
of such modifiers as functions which &amp;quot;coerce&amp;quot; their
inputs to the appropriate type, by a loose analogy with
type-coercion in programming languages (cf. Ait-Kaci
1984). Thus the effect on meaning of the combination of
the progressive with an expression denoting an atomic
punctual event as in Sandra was hiccupping occurs in
two stages: first the point proposition is coerced into a
process of iteration of that point. Only then can this
process be defined as ongoing, and hence as a progres-
sive state. These two stages might be represented as in
the following diagram:

The temporal/aspectual ontology that underlies the phe-
nomenon of aspectual type coercion can be defined in
terms of the transition network shown in Figure 2, in
which each transition is associated with a change in the
content and where, in addition, the felicity of any
particular transition for a given proposition is condi-
tional on support from knowledge and context.
of discrete steps of climbing, resting, having lunch, or
whatever. The consequent state may also be compound;
most importantly, it includes the further events, if any,
that are in the same sequence of contingently related
events as the culmination. Similarly, the culmination
itself may be a complex event. For example, we shall
see below that the entire culminated process of climbing
Mt. Everest can be treated as a culmination in its own
right. In this case, the associated preparatory process
and consequent state will be different ones to those
internal to the culminated process itself.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999514">
Rather than attempting to explain this diagram from first
principles, we present below a number of examples of
each transition. However, it is worth noting first that
many of the permissible transitions between aspectual
categories illustrated in Figure 2 appear to be related to
a single elementary contingency-based event structure
which we call a nucleus. A nucleus is defined as a
structure comprising a culmination, an associated pre-
paratory process, and a consequent state.2 It can be
represented pictorially as in Figure 3:

<bodyText confidence="0.955093785714286">
Any or all of these elements may be compound: for
example, the preparation leading to the culmination of
reaching the top of Mt. Everest may consist of a number
According to the present theory, progressive auxiliaries
are functions that require their input to denote a proc-
ess. Their result is a type of state that we shall call a
progressive state, which describes the process as ongo-
ing at the reference time. Thus the following sentence,
among other meanings that we shall get to in a moment,
can simply predicate of a present reference time that the
process in question began at some earlier time and has
not yet stopped:
14. The president is speaking.
If the input to a progressive is atomic then by definition
it cannot be described as ongoing. However, as was
noted in the introduction, it may be coerced into a
process by being iterated, as in
15. Harry is hiccupping.
There is another route through the network in Figure 2,
where the point is coerced into a culmination, i.e., as
constituting an atomic event that does have conse-
quences associated with it. In this case, the interpreta-
tion for (15) parallels the one given for Harry was
reaching the top, below. However, this particular ex-
ample is deliberately chosen in order to make that
interpretation unlikely.
If a progressive combines with a culminated process,
as in:
16. Roger was running a mile
—then the latter must also first be coerced to become a
process. The most obvious way to do this is to strip off
the culmination and leave the preparatory process be-
hind. It is this process that is stated to be ongoing at the
past reference time. Another possible coercion is to
treat the entire culminated process as a point, and to
iterate it. This interpretation appears to be the one that
is forced by continuing (16) as in:
17. Roger was running a mile last week. This week he is
up to three.
When a culmination expression like reach the top is
used with a progressive, it must be coerced to become
a process in a slightly more complicated way. The most

obvious path through the network in Figure 2 from the
culmination node to the process node involves first
adding a preparatory process to the culmination to make
it a culminated process, then stripping off the culmina-
tion point as before. Thus sentences like the following
describe this preparatory process as ongoing at the past
reference time:
18. Harry was reaching the top.
Again, an iterated reading is possible in principle, but
pragmatically unlikely here.
As a result of the coercions implicit in the last two
examples, it is no longer asserted that the culminations
in question ever in fact occurred, but only that the
associated preparatory processes did. Thus there is no
contradiction in continuations that explicitly deny the
culmination, like:
19. a. Harry was running a mile, but he gave up after
two laps.
b. Harry was reaching the top when he slipped and
fell to the bottom.
The fact that, according to the present theory, progres-
sives coerce their input to be a process so that any
associated culmination is stripped away and no longer
contributes to truth conditions provides a resolution of
the imperfective paradox (Dowty 1979), without appeal-
ing to theory-external constructs like inertia worlds.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999042">
3.2 THE PERFECT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989010117647059">
A perfect, as in
20. Harry has reached the top
is a function that requires its input category to be a
culmination. Its result is the corresponding consequent
state. The most obvious of these consequences for (20)
is that Harry still be at the top, although as usual there
are other possibilities. Informal evidence that this in-
deed is the function of the perfect can be obtained by
noticing that perfects are infelicitous if the salient
consequences are not in force. Thus, when I&apos;m on my
way to get a cloth to clean up the coffee I accidentally
spilled, I can say
21. I have spilled my coffee.
After cleaning up the mess, however, all the obvious
consequences associated with this event seem to be
over. In that context, it would be infelicitous to utter
(21).
If the input to a perfect is not a culmination, then the
perfect will do its best to coerce it to be one, subject to
the limitations imposed by contextual knowledge. If the
hearer cannot identify any relevant consequences, as
seems likely for the following example, then coercion
may simply fail, in which case a perfect will be infelic-
itous, as was noted earlier:
22. #The star has twinkled.
To be able to use a culminated process expression like
climbing Mount Everest with a perfect auxiliary, it first
has to be coerced into a culmination. Requiring such a
transition might seem unnecessary since a culminated
process already implies the existence of a culmination
with consequences to which the perfect could refer. But
consider Figure 4 as a possible rendering of the nucleus
associated with climbing Mt. Everest:
climbing the mountain being at the top

Figure 4.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.980901052631579">
If a perfect could be used to single out the consequences
of a nucleus associated with a culminated process
expression, then having climbed Mt. Everest could be
used to refer to the state of having reached the/ summit
or being at the top. However, this does not seem to be
the case. A reporter who has managed to establish radio
contact with a mountaineer who has just reached the top
of Mt. Everest is unlikely to ask
23. Have you climbed Mt. Everest yet?
The question rather seems to concern consequences of
the culminated process as a whole. We capture this fact
by making the perfect coerce the culminated process to
become a culmination. The transition network allows
this to happen if the entire event of climbing Mt.
Everest is treated as a single unit by making it a point,
so that it can become a culmination in its own right. The
perfect then delivers a rather different kind of conse-
quent state.
A process like work in the garden can be coerced by
a perfect auxiliary in essentially the same way: the
process of working, possibly associated with a culmina-
tion point, is treated as a single unit. This pointlike
entity can then be used as the starting point for the
construction of a new nucleus, by treating it as a
culmination in its own right, provided that there are
associated consequences. As a result, a question like 24
can only be used felicitously if John&apos;s working in the
garden was (for example) part of a prearranged plan, or
a particular task John had to finish before something
else could happen:
24. #Has John worked in the garden?
This account also explains the infelicity of a sentence
like (25):
25. #They have married yesterday.
The sentence could only refer to the consequences of
getting married yesterday as opposed to getting married

some other time. But most of what we think of as
consequences of events are independent of the specific
time at which the event occurred. (In this respect they
are different from the preparatory processes, which are
argued below to be implicated in certain futurates.) If a
certain situation is a consequence of an event taking
place at a particular time, then a perfect auxiliary may
be used to describe that event. Thus a superstitious
person believing that disastrous consequences are likely
to result from actions performed on an unpropitious
date can say:
26. They have married on Friday the 13th!
But even on Saturday the 14th, such a person still
cannot use (25), for it would not provide the essential
information about the date, thus flouting Grice&apos;s maxim
of quantity.
The account given here also explains the well-known
contrast between the infelicitous (27a) and its felicitous
counterpart, (b):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9608935">
27. a. #Einstein has visited Princeton.
b. Princeton has been visited by Einstein.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981752173913">
Whatever causal sequence of events and their conse-
quences associated with the individual (Einstein) we
take to be the one we are currently talking about, (a)
cannot be used felicitously to refer to a part of that
sequence since all such causal sequences seem to be to
do with his enduring consciousness and are therefore by
definition over. However, (b) can be uttered felicitously
to refer to that same event because the relevant causal
sequence must be one whose event and consequences
apply to the institution of Princeton University (whose
corporate consciousness endures) and many such con-
sequences are still in train.
The hypothesis we advance that the perfect has only
one temporal meaning has a precedent in the work of
Inoue 1979. Moens 1987 has extended the present
analysis to show that the distinctions McCawley 1971,
1981 and Comrie 1976 draw between different kinds of
perfects (such as &amp;quot;perfect of current relevance,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hot
news,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;result,&amp;quot; etc.) are nothing but different conse-
quent states, depending on the nature of the verbal
expression and the particular core event it expresses,
and the specific kind of episodes in which our general
knowledge tells us such core events typically occur.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993804">
3.3 ADVERBIALS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.921825066666667">
For-adverbials can only be used felicitously with proc-
ess expressions:
28. John worked in the garden for five hours.
The resulting combination is a culminated-process
expression. Evidence for this can be found in the ease
with which an expression like (28) can be combined with
a perfect, unlike its process counterpart:
29. #John has worked in the garden.
John has worked in the garden for five hours.
An expression like playing the sonata can readily occur
with afor-adverbial, suggesting that its basic category—
by which we mean the type assigned in the lexicon and
inherited by the proposition in the absence of any
coercion—is that of a process. As a result, (30) carries
no implication that Sue finished playing the sonata:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.58609675">
30. Sue played the sonata for a few minutes.
Another route through the network is possible in order
to account for examples like (30): Sue&apos;s playing the
sonata, like any other event, can be viewed as an
unstructured point. A transition to turn it into a process
then results in an iteration of occurrences at which Sue
plays the sonata. This route through the network seems
to be ruled out for (30) because it finds no support in our
knowledge about sonatas and about how long they
typically last. It does result, however, in a likely inter-
pretation for a sentence like
31. Sue played the sonata for about eight hours.

A similar transition path is needed to make sense of
examples like the following, in which a culmination is
coerced to become a point, and then in turn coerced to

The aspectual network would wrongly predict the ex-
istence of afor-adverbial paradox, parallel to the imper-
fective paradox, if for-adverbials were permitted to
freely coerce culminated processes (and hence culmina-
tions) to be (not necessarily completed) processes. The
theory might seem to wrongly predict that (a) below

<bodyText confidence="0.999935142857143">
However, it is hard to find a context in which (a) means
anything at all. The reason for this lies in the way
English syntax and morphology control coercion in the
aspectual transition network. The transition from cul-
mination to consequent state, for example, demands the
presence of a perfect. Similarly, the arc from process to
progressive state may be traversed only if a progressive
auxiliary is present in the sentence. For other transi-
tions, such as the one resulting in an iterated process or
an habitual state, English has no explicit markers and
they can be made freely.
The transition from culminated process to process is
not one that can be made freely in English, but seems to
require the presence of a progressive -ing-form. As a
result, turning the culmination in (33a) into a process by
first adding a preparatory process and then stripping off
the culmination point is not allowed. It is allowed in (b),
but only because the example contains the required
progressive -ing-form. The only other transition path in
the aspectual network that can account for the combi-
nation of a culmination with a for-adverbial is the one

that turns the culmination into a point, and then iterates
it to be a process. This interpretation is not felicitous for
(33a), either, given our knowledge about what consti-
tutes winning a race. However, as with (32), it is
acceptable for
34. Nikki Lauda won the Monaco Grand Prix for sev-
eral years.
Sometimes, a for-adverbial in combination with a cul-
mination seems to describe a time period following the
culmination rather than an iterated process:
35. John left the room for a few minutes.
This adverbial is of a different kind, however, express-
ing intention rather than duration. It is merely by
accident that English uses the same device to convey
these different meanings. In French or German, for
example, the two constructions are clearly distinct, as
shown in the following translations of (35) and (32):

<bodyText confidence="0.976655933333334">
Not all aspectual/temporal adverbials expressing a time
span have the same functional type. In-adverbials, for
example, coerce their input to be a culminated process
expression, as do related phrases like &amp;quot;it took me two
days to . . . .&amp;quot; This means that combination with a
culmination expression requires a transition to the cul-
minated process node. According to the aspectual net-
work in Figure 2 this transition is felicitous if the
context allows a preparatory process to be associated
with the culmination, as in (38):
38. Laura reached the top in two hours.
The in-adverbial then defines the length of this prepa-
ratory period.
Since the arcs describe how one must be able to view
the world for transitions to be made felicitously, it is
obvious that there are expressions that will resist cer-
tain changes. For example, it will be hard to find a
context in which an in-adverbial can be combined with
a culmination expression like Harry accidentally spilled
his coffee, since it is hard to imagine a context in which
a preparatory process can be associated with an invol-
untary act. Indeed, sentences like the following only
seem to be made tolerable to the extent that it is
possible to conjure up contexts in which the event only
appears to be accidental:
39. In fifteen minutes, Harry accidentally spilled his
coffee.
A similar problem arises in connection with the follow-
ing example:
40. John ran in a few minutes.
The process expression John ran has to be changed into
a culminated-process expression before combination
with the in-adverbial is possible. One way in which the
network in Figure 2 will permit the change from a
process to a culminated process is if the context allows
a culmination point to be associated with the process
itself. General world knowledge makes this rather hard
for a sentence like John ran, except in the case where
John habitually runs a particular distance, such as a
measured mile. If the in-adverbial had conveyed a
specific duration, such as in four minutes, then the
analysis would make sense, as Dowty has pointed out.
However, the unspecific in a few minutes continues to
resist this interpretation.
However, another route is also possible for (40): the
process of John running can be made into an atomic
point, and thence into a culmination in its own right.
This culmination can then acquire a preparatory process
of its own—which we can think of as preparing to run—
to become the culminated process which the adverbial
requires. This time, there is no conflict with the content
of the adverbial, so this reading is the most accessible of
the two.
Since the transition network includes loops, it will
allow us to define indefinitely complex temporal/aspect-
ual categories, like the one evoked by the following
sentence:
41. It took me two days to play the &amp;quot;Minute Waltz&amp;quot;
in less than sixty seconds for more than an hour.
The process expression play the Minute Waltz is co-
erced by the in-adverbial into a culminated process,
including a culmination of finishing playing the Minute
Waltz. Combination with the for-adverbial requires this
expression to be turned into a process—the only possi-
ble route through the network being that through the
point node and iterating. The resulting culminated-
process expression describes the iterated process of
playing the Minute Waltz in less than sixty seconds as
lasting for more than an hour. The expression it took
me . . . , finally, is like an in-adverbial in that it is
looking for a culminated-process expression to combine
with. It would find one in the expression to play the
Minute Waltz in less than sixty seconds for more than
an hour, but combination is hampered by the fact that
there is a conflict in the length of time the adverbials
describe. In the case of (41), the whole culminated
process is instead viewed as a culmination in its own
right (via the path through the point node). Knowledge
concerning such musical feats then supplies an appro-
priate preparatory process that we can think of as
practicing. The phrase it took me two days then defines
the temporal extent of this preparatory process needed
to reach the point at which repeatedly playing that piece
of music so fast for such a considerable length of time
became a newly acquired skill. We assume that the
ordering of these successive coercions, like others

induced by the perfect and the progressive, are (not
necessarily unambiguously) under the control of syntax.

4.1 TENSE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996834206521739">
The aspects and temporal/aspectual adverbials consid-
ered above all act to modify or change the aspectual
class of the core proposition, subject to the limits
imposed by the network in Figure 2, and by contextual
knowledge. However, tenses and certain other varieties
of adverbial adjuncts have a rather different character.
Tense is widely regarded as an anaphoric category,
requiring a previously established temporal referent.
The referent for a present tense is usually the time of
speech, but the referent for a past tense must be
explicitly established. This is done by using a second
type of &amp;quot;temporal&amp;quot; adjunct, such as once upon a time,
at five o&apos;clock last Saturday, while I was cleaning my
teeth, or when I woke up this morning.
Most accounts of the anaphoric nature of tense have
invoked Reichenbach&apos;s (1947) trinity of underlying
times and his concept of the positional use of the
reference time. Under these accounts, temporal ad-
juncts establish a referent to which the reference time of
a main clause and subsequent same-tensed clauses may
attach or refer, in much the same way that various
species of full noun phrases establish referents for
pronouns and definite anaphors (see foreword).
Reichenbach&apos;s account is somewhat inexplicit as far
as extended, noninstantaneous events go. In particular,
he makes it look as though the reference time is always
an instant. However, we believe that the following
account is the obvious generalisation of his and proba-
bly what he intended anyway.
In Reichenbach&apos;s system a simple past tense of an
atomic event is such that reference time (R) and event
time (E) are identical, while progressives and perfects
are such that R and E are not identical.3 The only
coherent generalisation of his scheme to durative events
is to maintain this pattern and assume that R and E are
coextensive for an utterance like:
42. Harry ran a mile.
It follows that R may be an extended period (cf.
Steedman 1982). R may also be an extended period for
a state such as a progressive, although in this case the
corresponding event time is still quite separate, of
course.
What is the nature of this referent, and how is it
established? The anaphoric quality of tense has often
been specifically compared to pronominal anaphora (cf.
McCawley 1971; Partee 1973; Isard 1974). However, in
one respect, the past tense does not behave like a
pronoun: use of a pronoun such as &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; does not
change the referent to which a subsequent use of the
same pronoun may refer, whereas using a past tense
may. In the following example, the temporal reference
point for the successive conjoined main clauses seems
to move on from the time originally established by the
adjunct:
43. At exactly five o&apos;clock, Harry walked in, sat down,
and took off his boots.
Nor is this just a matter of pragmatic inference; other
orders of the clauses are not allowed:
44. #At exactly five o&apos;clock, Harry took off his boots,
sat down and walked in.
This fact has caused theorists such as Dowty 1986,
Hinrichs 1984, and Partee 1984 to stipulate that the
reference time autonomously advances during a narra-
tive. However, such a stipulation (besides creating
problems for the theory vis-à-vis those narratives where
reference time seems not to advance) seems to be
unnecessary, since the amount by which the reference
time advances still has to be determined by context. The
concept of a nucleus that was invoked above to explain
the varieties of aspectual categories offers us exactly
what we need to explain both the fact that the reference
time advances and by how much. We simply need to
assume that a main-clause event such as Harry walked
in is interpreted as an entire nucleus, complete with
consequent state, for by definition the consequent state
comprises whatever other events were contingent upon
Harry walking in, including whatever he did next.
Provided that the context (or the hearer&apos;s assumptions
about the world) supports the idea that a subsequent
main clause identifies this next contingent event, then it
will provide the temporal referent for that main clause.
If the context does not support this interpretation, then
the temporal referent will be unchanged, as in:
45. At five o&apos;clock, my car started and the rain stopped.
In its ability to refer to temporal entities that have not
been explicitly mentioned, but whose existence has
merely been implied by the presence of an entity that
has been mentioned, tense appears more like a definite
NP (e.g., the music in the following example) than like
a pronoun, as Webber 1987 points out.
46. I went to a party last night. The music was wonder-
ful.

4.2 WHEN-CLAUSES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986">
The definite nature of tense together with the notion of
the nucleus as the knowledge structure that tensed
expressions conjure up explain the apparent ambiguity
of when-clauses with which this paper began. A when-
clause behaves rather like one of those phrases that are
used to explicitly change topic, such as and your father
in the following example (cf. Isard 1975):

</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922111111111">
A when-clause does not require a previously established
temporal focus, but rather brings into focus a novel
temporal referent whose unique identifiability in the
hearer&apos;s memory is presupposed. Again, the focused
temporal referent is associated with an entire nucleus,
and again an event main clause can refer to any part of
this structure conditional on support from general or
discourse specific knowledge. For example, consider
again Example 1 with which we began (repeated here):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.80226">
48. When they built the 39th Street bridge . . .
a. . . . a local architect drew up the plans.
b. . . . they used the best materials.
c. . . . they solved most of their traffic problems.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.943021208333333">
Once the core event of the when-clause has been
identified in memory, the hearer has two alternative
routes to construct a complete nucleus:
a) to decompose the core event into a nucleus and to
make a transition to one of the components, such as
the preparatory activity of building or to the conse-
quent state of having built the bridge; or
b) to treat the entire event as a single culmination and
compose it into a nucleus with whatever preparation
and consequences the context provides for the activ-
ity of building a bridge, and to make the transition to
either one of those.
Either way, once the nucleus is established, the refer-
ence time of the main clause has to be situated some-
where within it—the exact location being determined by
knowledge of the entities involved and the episode in
question. So in Example 48a, the entire culminated
process of building the bridge tends to become a culmi-
nation (via a path in Figure 2 that passes through the
point node), which is associated in a nucleus with
preparations for, and consequences of, the entire busi-
ness, as in Figure 5:

<bodyText confidence="0.999644">
The drawing up of the plans is then, for reasons to do
with knowledge of the world, situated in the preparatory
phase.
In Example b, in contrast, people tend to see the
building of the bridge as decomposed into a quite
different preparatory process of building, a quite differ-
ent culmination of completing the bridge and some
consequences that we take to be also subtly distinct
from those in the previous case as was argued in Section
3.2. The resulting nucleus is given in Figure 6. The use
of the best materials is then, as in (a), situated in the
preparatory process—but it is a different one this time.

<bodyText confidence="0.979330974576271">
Thus a main clause event can potentially be situated
anywhere along this nucleus, subject to support from
knowledge about the precise events involved. But Ex-
ample 2, repeated here, is still strange, because it is so
hard to think of any relation that is supported in this
way:
49. #When my car broke down, the sun set.
The when-clause defines a nucleus, consisting of what-
ever process we can think of as leading up to the car&apos;s
breakdown, the breakdown itself, and its possible or
actual consequences. It is not clear where along this
nucleus the culmination of the sun set could be situated:
it is not easy to imagine that it is a functional part of the
preparatory process typically associated with a break-
down, and it is similarly hard to imagine that it can be a
part of the consequent state, so under most imaginable
circumstances, the utterance remains bizarre.
The constraints when places on possible interpreta-
tions of the relation between subordinate and main
clause are therefore quite strong. First, general and
specific knowledge about the event described in the
when-clause has to support the association of a com-
plete nucleus with it. Secondly, world knowledge also
has to support the contingency relation between the
events in subordinate and main clauses. As a result,
many constructed examples sound strange or are. con-
sidered to be infelicitous, because too much context has
to be imported to make sense of them.
In all of the cases discussed so far, the main clause
has been an event of some variety. With stative main
clauses, as in the following examples, the interpretation
strategy is somewhat different. Statives show no sign of
being related under what we are calling contingency,
presumably because contingency is by definition a
relation over events. In particular, they do not enter in
a causal or contingent relation with a when-clause the
way corresponding sentences with events as main
Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 23
Marc Moens and Mark Steedman Temporal Ontology and Temporal Reference
clauses do. They therefore merely predicate that the
state in question holds at the time of the culmination:
50. When they built that bridge
. . . I was still a young lad.
. . . my grandfather had been dead for
several years.
. . . my aunt was having an affair with the
milkman.
. . . my father used to play squash.
However, a stative main clause can be turned into an
event expression; in that case, a contingency relation is
predicated to exist between the two events. Thus the
following example seems to involve an inceptive event,
which begins the state of knowing:
51. When Pete came in, I knew that something was
wrong.
Such changes of type are similar to others discussed
above but are not treated in the present paper.
5 REFERRING TO FUTURE EVENTS
Bennett and Partee 1972, speaking of the difference
between the present perfect and the simple past, remark
that one might expect a similar distinction among future
tenses. One could conceive of a construction parallel to
the perfect, whose event time would be in the future and
whose reference time would be the time of speech,
conveying a notion of current relevance; and there
could be a construction parallel to the simple past, with
both reference and event times in the future. Bennett
and Partee suggest that English is not as one would
expect and follow Reichenbach in saying that these two
functions are conflated in a single device, the modal
future using will. Although it is true that the modal
future shares features of both perfect and simple past, it
is nevertheless also the case that there are two classes
of futurate expressions, with properties parallel to each
of the two past expressions.
The candidate for the role parallel to the perfect is the
so-called futurate progressive (Smith 1983):
52. Robert was working on the speech project until he
got a job offer from Sussex.
As Dowty 1979, 1986 argues, examples like (52) can be
both a past imperfective progressive (answering a ques-
tion about Robert&apos;s past activities) and a past futurate
progressive (answering a question about Robert&apos;s plans
at some past time and meaning something like Robert
was going to work on the speech project, but he didn&apos;t).
However, the difference between the two interpreta-
tions seems to be a matter of pragmatic world knowl-
edge rather than sense-semantics, corresponding to the
two different ways of constructing a nucleus (cf. Section
4). The imperfective progressive decomposes the core
event into a nucleus and makes a transition to the
preparatory process, indicating that it is in progress at
the time of reference. The futurate progressive, through
the use of an adverbial signaling an event time posterior
to the reference, forces the whole event to be treated as
a single unit, which is then composed into a new
nucleus. The progressive then indicates that the prepa-
ration leading up to the event as a whole was in progress
at the time of reference (as usual, without asserting that
that event or even its onset was ever reached). The
futurate progressive thus resembles the perfect in say-
ing something about a (past or present) reference time
that is entirely separate from the event time.
The candidate for the role parallel to the simple past
among the futurates is to be found in the simple, or
non-modal future, sometimes (confusingly) called the
tenseless future:
53. He leaves on Tuesday.
While the futurate progressive shares with the perfect
the property of needing no nonpresent adverbial, the
nonmodal future cannot be used in this way. For
example, in response to a question about the current
state of affairs as specific as Why are you being so rude
to your boss these days? or as general as What&apos;s new?,
one may respond with an unanchored progressive (54a),
much as with a perfect (54b). But one may not reply
with an unanchored nonmodal future (54c), although an
anchored one (54d) is quite all right.

<listItem confidence="0.8369125">

b. I have handed in my notice.
c. *I leave.
d. I leave next month.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981743833333333">
In its requirement for an established non-present refer-
ence time, the nonmodal future resembles the past
tense. The resemblance (which was noted in Leech
1971) is supported by the following further observa-
tions. A when question concerning the past progressive
is ambiguous, reflecting the separation of reference time
and event time. By contrast, the nonmodal future does
not really seem to occur in the past at all, except of
course in reported or indirect speech; it just becomes
indistinguishable from the simple past. It follows that
(55) can be answered with (a) or (b). But (56) can only be
answered with (a), not with (b).

These similarities suggest the symmetry depicted infor-
mally in Figure 7 between the perfect, the simple past,
the futurate progressive, and the nonmodal future. The
hatching again informally indicates the extent of the
consequent state and the preparatory process associ-
ated with the perfect and the futurate progressive,

respectively. That is not to imply that the two are the
same sort of entity: they are both states, but of a
different kind. The perfect is a consequent state; the
futurate progressive is a state derived from a prepara-
tory process. This difference is indicated by the pres-
ence of a defined upper bound on the latter. The
Reichenbach diagram in Figure 7 for the nonmodal
future is of course the one that is ascribed (traditionally
and by Bennett and Partee) to the modal future, a
construction to which we will return in a moment.
Before doing so there are some problems remaining to
be disposed of.
If the futurate progressive is the true counterpart of
the perfect,why is it not subject to the same restriction
against nonpresent adverbials?
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.660912">
57. a. John is leaving (tomorrow).
b. John has left (*yesterday).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974470588235">
The answer lies in the differences between preparatory
processes and consequent states, rather than in the
aspects themselves. In both cases the adverbial must
associate with the core event of leaving rather than the
present reference time. Thus (a) concerns the prepara-
tions for leaving tomorrow (as opposed to some other
time), while (b) concerns the consequences of leaving
yesterday (as opposed to some other time). As was
pointed out in Section 3.2, most of what we think of as
consequences of events are independent of absolute
time. This makes it hard to think of consequences
associated with John&apos;s leaving yesterday as opposed to
those associated with John&apos;s leaving generally. Prepa-
ratory processes do not share this property: the prepa-
ratory process associated with John&apos;s leaving tomorrow
is conceivably very different from that associated with
John&apos;s leaving next week.

One other difference between the futurate categories
and the past categories should be mentioned. If the
nonmodal future is the correlate of the simple past, it
should be possible to have nonmodal futures of per-
fects, just as with pasts of perfects. But Vetter 1973 has
pointed out that the following is odd:
58. The Dodgers have finished for the season next
Sunday.
Nevertheless, such futurates do appear in the context of
futurate temporal adjuncts, as in the following example:
59. Once the Dodgers play the Red Sox next Sunday,
they have finished for the season.
The other English futurate expressions also fit into the
scheme of Figure 7. The &amp;quot;be going to&amp;quot; construction
typified by
60. I am going to buy a guitar.
clearly belongs with the progressives, being distin-
guished from them by the nature of the processes that it
implicates (see Leech 1971; Palmer 1974; Wekker 1976,
and references therein). The &amp;quot;be to&amp;quot; construction typ-
ified by
61. I am to be Queen of the May
also seems to belong with the progressives, although its
modal character has been remarked by Leech and
Palmer.
Finally, where does the modal future fit into this
scheme? A full analysis of the modals would go beyond
the scope of this paper, so the following remarks will be
sketchy. The modal future clearly has a reference time
not coincident with speech time, like the nonmodal
future but unlike the futurate progressive. Neverthe-
less, Bennett and Partee are quite right that the modal
future says something about the present as well as the
past. The source of its relevance to the time of speech
must therefore have to do with the relation between
modals and the time of speech. We make the following
tentative suggestion about this relation.
Palmer 1974 pointed out a systematic ambiguity
within the epistemic modals as between a futurate and a
strictly present meaning, and Steedman 1977 related
this to the similar ambiguity of a present-tensed sen-
tence. What needs to be added seems to be the idea that
these (suspiciously untensed looking) modals define
properties of the time of speech (as is implied by the
speech-act theoretic analysis of Boyd and Thorne 1969)
and do not of themselves have anything to do with
reference time and event time, unlike the true tensed
and aspectual auxiliaries. More specifically, will says of
the time of speech that it leads the speaker to infer a

6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985208877551021">
We have argued in this paper that a principled and
unified semantics of natural-language categories like
tense, aspect, and aspectual/temporal adverbials re-
quires an ontology based on contingency rather than
temporality. The notion of nucleus plays a crucial role in
this ontology. The process of temporal reference in-
volves reference to the appropriate part of a nucleus,
where appropriateness is a function of the inherent
meaning of the core expression, of the coercive nature
of co-occurring linguistic expressions, and of particular
and general knowledge about the area of discourse.
The identification of the correct ontology is also a
vital preliminary to the construction and management of
temporal databases. Effective exchange of information
between people and machines is easier if the data-
structures that are used to organise the information in
the machine correspond in a natural way to the concep-
tual structures people use to organise the same infor-
mation. In fact, the penalties for a bad fit between
data-structures and human concepts are usually crip-
pling for any attempt to provide natural language inter-
faces for database systems. Information extracted from
natural-language text can only be stored to the extent
that it fits the preconceived formats, usually resulting in
loss of information. Conversely, such data-structures
cannot easily be queried using natural language if there
is a bad fit between the conceptual structure implicit in
the query and the conceptual structure of the database.
The contingency-based ontology that we are advo-
cating here has a number of implications for the con-
struction and management of such temporal databases.
Rather than a homogeneous database of dated points or
intervals, we should partition it into distinct sequences
of causally or otherwise contingently related sequences
of events, which we might call episodes, each leading to
the satisfaction of a particular goal or intention. This
partition will quite incidentally define a partial temporal
ordering on the events, but the primary purpose of such
sequences is more related to the notion of a plan of
action or an explanation of an event&apos;s occurrence than
to anything to do with time itself. It follows that only
events that are contingently related necessarily have
well-defined temporal relations in memory.
A first attempt to investigate this kind of system was
reported in Steedman 1982, using a program that veri-
fied queries against a database structured according to
some of the principles outlined above; a more recent
extension of this work was reported in Moens 1987.
Events are stored as primitives in the database, possibly
but not necessarily associated with a time point. Ex-
tended events are represented in terms of a pair of
punctual events, identifying their starting point as well
as the point at which they end (in the case of processes)
or culminate (in the case of culminated processes).
Apart from the obvious accessibility relations of
temporal precedence and simultaneity, events can also
enter into the relation of contingency introduced above.
It is significant that the relation used in the implemen-
tation is identical to the notion of causality used by
Lansky 1986 in an entirely different problem area. She
developed a knowledge representation scheme for use
in planners in which events are reified and modeled with
an explicit representation of their temporal as well as
causal relations. In this scheme, a mechanism is pro-
vided for structuring events into so-called &amp;quot;locations of
activity&amp;quot;, the boundaries of which are boundaries of
&amp;quot;causal&amp;quot; access. As a result, two events with no causal
relation between them cannot belong to the same loca-
tion of activity—as in the episodes introduced above.
Because we follow Lansky in making the contin-
gency relation intransitive, we avoid certain notorious
problems in the treatment of when-clauses and perfects,
which arise because the search for possible conse-
quences of an event has to be restricted to the first event
on the chain of contingencies. Thus, when (3) is as-
serted, repeated here as (63a) and (b), it would be wrong
to infer (c):
63. a. When John left, Sue cried.
b. When Sue cried, her mother got upset.
c. When John left, Sue&apos;s mother got upset.
The reason is exactly the same as the reason that it
would be wrong to infer that Sue&apos;s mother got upset
because John left, and has nothing to do with the purely
temporal relations of these events. It should also be
noted that the notion of contingency used here (in line
with Lansky&apos;s proposals) is weaker than the notion of
causality used in other representation schemes (for
example, that of McDermott 1982 or Allen 1984): if
Event A stands in a contingent relation to Event B, then
an occurrence of A will not automatically lead to an
occuirence of B: John laying the foundations of the
house is a prerequisite for or enables him to build the
walls and roof, but does not cause it in the more
traditional sense of the word and does not automatically
or inevitably lead to him building the walls.
The transitions in the network are implemented as
inference procedures in the database. Answering a

7 CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978230769231">
Many of the apparent anomalies and ambiguities that
plague current semantic accounts of temporal expres-
sions in natural language stem from the assumption that
a linear model of time is the one that our linguistic
categories are most directly related to. A more princi-
pled semantics is possible on the assumption that the
temporal categories of tense, aspect, aspectual adver-
bials, and of propositions themselves refer to a mental
representation of events that is structured on other than
purely temporal principles, and to which the notion of a
nucleus, or contingently related sequence of prepara-
tory process, goal event, and consequent state, is
central.

NOTES
I. Readers familiar with Vendler&apos;s work will realise that we have
changed his terminology. We have done so both for notational
convenience and to avoid the considerable confusion that has
arisen concerning the precise meaning of the old terms. The new
nomenclature is also intended to reflect the fact, also noted by
Dowty (1979), that Vendler&apos;s &amp;quot;accomplishments,&amp;quot; which we will
refer to as &amp;quot;culminated processes,&amp;quot; are composite events, consist-
ing of a process which is associated with a particular culmination
point.
2. A similar tripartite event structure is proposed in Passonneau
(1987, cf. this volume).
3. In attributing this view to Reichenbach, we are assuming that there
is an oversight or a misprint in his diagram for the past progressive,
p. 290: the diagram seems to suggest that R and E are coextensive,
whereas what is intended is that the punctual reference time is
included in an extended event time, as in his diagram for the
present progressive. We also ignore here one of his analyses of the
modal future, which we regard as incorrect (cf. Section 5).
4. It is E.n implication of such an analysis that there should be no truly
past version of epistemically modal propositions. Where past
tenses of the epistemic modals do occur, they must, like the past
nonntodal future, always be either counterfactual or indirect or
repotted speech. This seems to be the case. Mary McCarthy
(1974), speaking of David Halberstam&apos;s use in The Best and the
Brig! test of &amp;quot;what she could only describe as the Future Past,&amp;quot; as
in
i. At a dinner party after the Bay of Pigs Bundy would tell
friends . . .
and
ii. The power and prestige that the McNamara years would
bring. . .

called it &amp;quot;that awful tense, seeming to endow the author with
prophetic powers,&amp;quot; signifying &amp;quot;a future already plangent when it
has not yet happened.&amp;quot; The source of that awful power (which also
accrues to the past tenses of the nonmodal future and, as McCarthy
also remarks, the modal-like &amp;quot;be to&amp;quot; construction), is of course the
shifting of the speech or consciousness time into the past, rather
than the reference time.

A semantics of temporal categories in language and a theory of their use in defining the temporal relations between events both require a more complex structure on the domain underlying the meaning representations than is commonly assumed. This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. A central notion in the ontology is that of an elementary event-complex called a &amp;quot;nucleus.&amp;quot; A nucleus can be thought of as an association of a goal event, or &amp;quot;culmination,&amp;quot; with a &amp;quot;preparatory process&amp;quot; by which it is accomplished, and a &amp;quot;consequent state,&amp;quot; which ensues. Natural-language categories like aspects, futurates, adverbials, and when-clauses are argued to change the temporal/aspectual category of propositions under the control of such a nucleic knowledge representation structure. The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category. We claim that any manageable formalism for naturallanguage temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.</abstract>

The phenomenon of change in the aspectual type of a proposition under the influence of modifiers like tenses, temporal adverbials, and aspectual auxiliaries is of central importance to the present account. We shall talk of such modifiers as functions which &amp;quot;coerce&amp;quot; their inputs to the appropriate type, by a loose analogy with type-coercion in programming languages (cf. Ait-Kaci 1984). Thus the effect on meaning of the combination of the progressive with an expression denoting an atomic punctual event as in Sandra was hiccupping occurs in two stages: first the point proposition is coerced into a process of iteration of that point. Only then can this process be defined as ongoing, and hence as a progressive state. These two stages might be represented as in the following diagram: Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 17 Marc Moens and Mark Steedman Temporal Ontology and Temporal Reference 13.

This contingent, nontemporal relation on the representation of events in episodic memory also determines the ontology of propositions associated with linguistic expressions denoting events and states. It is to these that we turn first. 2 TEMPORAL AND ASPECTUAL CATEGORIES Propositions conveyed by English sentences uttered in context can, following Vendler, be classified into temporal or aspectual types, partly on the basis of the tenses, aspects, and adverbials with which they can co-occur (cf. Dowty 1979, and the introduction to the present collection). The term aspectual type refers to the relation that a speaker predicates of the particular happening that their utterance describes, relative to other happenings in the domain of the discourse. What the speaker says about those relations is of course quite distinct from what those relations objectively are. In particular, the speaker&apos;s predications about events will typically be coloured by the fact that those events are involved in sequences that are planned, predicted, intended, or otherwise governed by agencies of one kind or another.

Thus there is no contradiction in continuations that explicitly deny the culmination, like: 19. a. Harry was running a mile, but he gave up after two laps. b. Harry was reaching the top when he slipped and fell to the bottom. The fact that, according to the present theory, progressives coerce their input to be a process so that any associated culmination is stripped away and no longer contributes to truth conditions provides a resolution of the imperfective paradox (Dowty 1979), without appealing to theory-external constructs like inertia worlds. 3.2 THE PERFECT A perfect, as in 20. Harry has reached the top is a function that requires its input category to be a culmination. Its result is the corresponding consequent state. The most obvious of these consequences for (20) is that Harry still be at the top, although as usual there are other possibilities. Informal evidence that this indeed is the function of the perfect can be obtained by noticing that perfects are infelicitous if the salient consequences are not in force.

Although it is true that the modal future shares features of both perfect and simple past, it is nevertheless also the case that there are two classes of futurate expressions, with properties parallel to each of the two past expressions. The candidate for the role parallel to the perfect is the so-called futurate progressive (Smith 1983): 52. Robert was working on the speech project until he got a job offer from Sussex. As Dowty 1979, 1986 argues, examples like (52) can be both a past imperfective progressive (answering a question about Robert&apos;s past activities) and a past futurate progressive (answering a question about Robert&apos;s plans at some past time and meaning something like Robert was going to work on the speech project, but he didn&apos;t). However, the difference between the two interpretations seems to be a matter of pragmatic world knowledge rather than sense-semantics, corresponding to the two different ways of constructing a nucleus (cf. Section 4). The imperfective progressive decomposes the core event into a nucl</context>

However, such a stipulation (besides creating problems for the theory vis-à-vis those narratives where reference time seems not to advance) seems to be unnecessary, since the amount by which the reference time advances still has to be determined by context. The concept of a nucleus that was invoked above to explain the varieties of aspectual categories offers us exactly what we need to explain both the fact that the reference time advances and by how much.

We will argue instead that when has a single sense-meaning, reflecting its role of establishing a temporal focus, which we follow Isard and Longuet-Higgins (1973) in relating to Reichenbach&apos;s reference time (cf. introduction to this collection). The apparent diversity of meanings arises from the nature of this referent and the organisation of events and states of affairs in episodic memory under a relation we shall call contingency, a term related, but not identical to a notion like causality, rather than mere temporal sequentiality.

It is significant that the relation used in the implementation is identical to the notion of causality used by Lansky 1986 in an entirely different problem area. She developed a knowledge representation scheme for use in planners in which events are reified and modeled with an explicit representation of their temporal as well as causal relations. In this scheme, a mechanism is provided for structuring events into so-called &amp;quot;locations of activity&amp;quot;, the boundaries of which are boundaries of &amp;quot;causal&amp;quot; access.

But one may not reply with an unanchored nonmodal future (54c), although an anchored one (54d) is quite all right. 54. a. I am leaving. b. I have handed in my notice. c. *I leave. d. I leave next month. In its requirement for an established non-present reference time, the nonmodal future resembles the past tense. The resemblance (which was noted in Leech 1971) is supported by the following further observations. A when question concerning the past progressive is ambiguous, reflecting the separation of reference time and event time. By contrast, the nonmodal future does not really seem to occur in the past at all, except of course in reported or indirect speech; it just becomes indistinguishable from the simple past. It follows that (55) can be answered with (a) or (b). But (56) can only be answered with (a), not with (b). 55. When were you leaving? a. Last week (ambiguous). b. Next week. 56.

This fact has caused theorists such as Dowty 1986, Hinrichs 1984, and Partee 1984 to stipulate that the reference time autonomously advances during a narrative. However, such a stipulation (besides creating problems for the theory vis-à-vis those narratives where reference time seems not to advance) seems to be unnecessary, since the amount by which the reference time advances still has to be determined by context. The concept of a nucleus that was invoked above to explain the varieties of aspectual categories offers us exactly what we need to explain both the fact that the reference time advances and by how much.

However, there are good reasons for suspecting that such a conception is not the one that our linguistic categories are most directly related to. When-clauses provide an example of the mismatch between linguistic temporal categories and a semantics based on such an assumption. Consider the following examples, suggested by Ritchie 1979: 1. When they built the 39th Street bridge . . . a. . . . a local architect drew up the plans. b. . . . they used the best materials. c. . . . they solved most of their traffic problems. To map the temporal relations expressed in these examples onto linear time, and to try to express the semantics of when in terms of points or intervals (possibly associated with events), would appear to imply either that when is multiply ambiguous, allowing these points or intervals to be temporally related in at least three different ways, or that the relation expressed Copyright 1988 by the Association for </context>

Bennett and Partee suggest that English is not as one would expect and follow Reichenbach in saying that these two functions are conflated in a single device, the modal future using will. Although it is true that the modal future shares features of both perfect and simple past, it is nevertheless also the case that there are two classes of futurate expressions, with properties parallel to each of the two past expressions. The candidate for the role parallel to the perfect is the so-called futurate progressive (Smith 1983): 52. Robert was working on the speech project until he got a job offer from Sussex. As Dowty 1979, 1986 argues, examples like (52) can be both a past imperfective progressive (answering a question about Robert&apos;s past activities) and a past futurate progressive (answering a question about Robert&apos;s plans at some past time and meaning something like Robert was going to work on the speech project, but he didn&apos;t). However, the difference between the two interpretations seems to be a matter of pragmatic world knowledge rather than sense-semantics, corresponding to the two different ways of construc</context>

However, we believe that the following account is the obvious generalisation of his and probably what he intended anyway. In Reichenbach&apos;s system a simple past tense of an atomic event is such that reference time (R) and event time (E) are identical, while progressives and perfects are such that R and E are not identical.3 The only coherent generalisation of his scheme to durative events is to maintain this pattern and assume that R and E are coextensive for an utterance like: 42. Harry ran a mile. It follows that R may be an extended period (cf. Steedman 1982). R may also be an extended period for a state such as a progressive, although in this case the corresponding event time is still quite separate, of course. What is the nature of this referent, and how is it established? The anaphoric quality of tense has often been specifically compared to pronominal anaphora (cf.

However, in one respect, the past tense does not behave like a pronoun: use of a pronoun such as &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; does not change the referent to which a subsequent use of the same pronoun may refer, whereas using a past tense may.

This partition will quite incidentally define a partial temporal ordering on the events, but the primary purpose of such sequences is more related to the notion of a plan of action or an explanation of an event&apos;s occurrence than to anything to do with time itself. It follows that only events that are contingently related necessarily have well-defined temporal relations in memory. A first attempt to investigate this kind of system was reported in Steedman 1982, using a program that verified queries against a database structured according to some of the principles outlined above; a more recent extension of this work was reported in Moens 1987. Events are stored as primitives in the database, possibly but not necessarily associated with a time point. Extended events are represented in terms of a pair of punctual events, identifying their starting point as well as the point at which they end (in the case of processes) or culminate (in the case of culminated processes).

Preparatory processes do not share this property: the preparatory process associated with John&apos;s leaving tomorrow is conceivably very different from that associated with John&apos;s leaving next week. PAST E,R (simple past) John left. FUTURATE E,R (futurate progressive) (nonmodal future) John is leaving (tomorrow). John leaves tomorrow. Figure 7. One other difference between the futurate categories and the past categories should be mentioned. If the nonmodal future is the correlate of the simple past, it should be possible to have nonmodal futures of perfects, just as with pasts of perfects. But Vetter 1973 has pointed out that the following is odd: 58. The Dodgers have finished for the season next Sunday. Nevertheless, such futurates do appear in the context of futurate temporal adjuncts, as in the following example: 59. Once the Dodgers play the Red Sox next Sunday, they have finished for the season.

In its ability to refer to temporal entities that have not been explicitly mentioned, but whose existence has merely been implied by the presence of an entity that has been mentioned, tense appears more like a definite NP (e.g., the music in the following example) than like a pronoun, as Webber 1987 points out. 46.
