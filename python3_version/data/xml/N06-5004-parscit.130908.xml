Ever increasing computing power and connectivity bandwidth together with falling storage costs is re-
sulting in overwhelming amounts of multimedia data being produced, exchanged, and stored. One key
application area in this realm is the search and retrieval of spoken audio documents. As storage becomes
cheaper, the availability and usefulness of large collections of spoken documents is limited strictly by the
lack of adequate technology to exploit them. Manually transcribing speech is expensive and sometimes
outright impossible due to privacy concerns. This leads us to exploring an automatic approach to searching
and navigating spoken document collections. This tutorial will present an overview of speech transcription,
indexing, and search technologies for spoken documents, with an emphasis on a corpus containing recorded
academic lectures. The tutorial will point out general problems in this area and suggest possible solutions.
Included in the tutorial will be a discussion of scenarios and previous projects in the area of spoken doc-
ument retrieval, issues of automatic transcription of long audio files, and techniques for the indexing and
retrieval of spoken audio files.

3. Audio Retrieval
– Overview of text retrieval algorithms:
* TF-IDF/vector space methods
* Probabilistic methods
* Large scale web search (Google)
* Inverted indexing; query processing/language.
– Speech recognition lattices:
* Word/phone/OOV-models for generation
* Lattice accuracy vs. 1-best accuracy
– Query processing (OOV problem)/language:
* ”Soft”-indexing with pruning to control size
* Combine sub-word and word-level indexing/recognition results
– Relevance scoring:
* Proximity
* Incorporating multiple data streams: speech, text, title, author, abstract, etc.
* Tuning precision/recall at query run-time
– Evaluation:
* Basic Metrics: Precision/Recall
* Ordered list metrics: Kendall-Tau, Spearman
* TREC measures and package (Mean Average Precision, R-precision)
* Issues with evaluating speech data
– User interface:
* Issues in consuming speech (as opposed to text, images)
* Pro’s/con’s for displaying transcription
* Navigation in long documents with errorful transcriptions
* Segmentation: topic boundaries, keywords, summaries

This tutorial is designed for people interested in learning about the technologies used to transcribe, process,
search, and retreive spoken audio materials. Detailed prior knowledge of speech recognition and/or search
technologies is not required.
Ciprian Chelba is a Research Scientist with Google. Previously he worked as a Researcher in the Speech
Technology Group at Microsoft Research. His core research interests are in statistical modeling of natural
language and speech. Recent projects include speech content indexing for search in spoken documents,
discriminative language modeling for large vocabulary speech recognition, as well as speech and text clas-
sification.
Timothy J. Hazen is a Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
where he works in the areas of automatic speech recognition, automatic person identification, multi-modal
speech processing, and conversational speech systems. For the last two years he has been a key contributor
to the MIT Spoken Lecture Processing Project.
