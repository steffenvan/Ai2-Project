1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99920778">
This paper presents a new semantic representation
intended to allow more detailed assessment of stu-
dent responses to questions from an intelligent tu-
toring system (ITS). Assessment within current
ITSs generally provides little more than an indica-
tion that the student’s response expressed the target
knowledge or it did not. Furthermore, virtually all
ITSs are developed in a very domain-specific way,
with each new question requiring the handcrafting
of new semantic extraction frames, parsers, logic
representations, or knowledge-based ontologies
(c.f., Jordan et al., 2004). This is also true of re-
search in the area of scoring constructed response
questions (e.g., Leacock, 2004).
The goal of the representation described here is
to facilitate domain-independent assessment of
student responses to questions in the context of a
known reference answer and to perform this as-
sessment at a level of detail that will enable more
effective ITS dialog. We have two key criteria for
this representation: 1) it must be at a level that fa-
cilitates detailed assessment of the learner’s under-
standing, indicating exactly where and in what
manner the answer did not meet expectations and
2) the representation and assessment should be
learnable by an automated system – they should
not require the handcrafting of domain-specific
representations of any kind.
Rather than have a single expressed versus un-
expressed assessment of the reference answer as a
whole, we instead break the reference answer
down into what we consider to be approximately
its lowest level compositional facets. This roughly
translates to the set of triples composed of labeled
(typed) dependencies in a dependency parse of the
reference answer. Breaking the reference answer
down into fine-grained facets permits a more fo-
cused assessment of the student’s response, but a
simple yes or no entailment at the facet level still
lacks semantic expressiveness with regard to the
relation between the student’s answer and the facet
in question, (e.g., did the student contradict the
facet or completely fail to address it?) Therefore, it
is also necessary to break the annotation labels into
finer levels in order to specify more clearly the
relationship between the student’s answer and the
reference answer facet. The emphasis of this paper
is on this fine-grained facet-based representation –
considerations in defining it, the process of extract-
ing it, and the benefit of using it.

We acquired grade 3-6 responses to 287 questions
from the Assessing Science Knowledge (ASK)
project (Lawrence Hall of Science, 2006). The re-
sponses, which range in length from moderately
short verb phrases to several sentences, cover all
16 diverse Full Option Science System teaching
and learning modules spanning life science, physi-
cal science, earth and space science, scientific rea-
soning, and technology. We generated a corpus by
transcribing a random sample (approx. 15400) of
the students’ handwritten responses.

2.1 Knowledge Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999686428571429">
The ASK assessments included a reference answer
for each constructed response question. These ref-
erence answers were manually decomposed into
fine-grained facets, roughly extracted from the re-
lations in a syntactic dependency parse and a shal-
low semantic parse. The decomposition is based
closely on these well-established frameworks,
since the representations have been shown to be
learnable by automatic systems (c.f., Gildea and
Jurafsky, 2002; Nivre et al., 2006).
Figure 1 illustrates the process of deriving the
constituent facets that comprise the representation
of the final reference answer. We begin by deter-
mining the dependency parse following the style of
MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006). This dependency
parse was then modified in several ways. The ra-
tionale for the modifications, which we elaborate
below, is to increase the semantic content of facets.
These more expressive facets are used later to gen-
erate features for the assessment classification task.
These types of modifications to the parser output
address known limitations of current statistical
parser outputs, and are reminiscent of the modifi-
cations advocated by Briscoe and Carroll for more
effective parser evaluation, (Briscoe, et. al, 2002).
Example 1 illustrates the reference answer facets
derived from the final dependencies in Figure 1,
along with their glosses.

Various linguistic theories take a different
stance on what term should be the governor in a
number of phrase types, particularly noun phrases.
In this regard, the manual parses here varied from
the style of MaltParser by raising lexical items to
governor status when they contextually carried
more significant semantics. In our example, the
verb stick is made the governor of would, whose
modifiers are reattached to stick. Similarly, the
noun phrases the pattern of pigments and the bunch
of leaves typically result in identical dependency
parses. However, the word pattern is considered
the governor of pigments; whereas, conversely the
word leaves is treated as the governor of bunch
because it carries more semantics. Then, terms that
were not crucial to the student answer, frequently
auxiliary verbs, were removed (e.g., the modal
would and determiners in our example).
Next, we incorporate prepositions into the de-
pendency type labels following (Lin and Pantel,
2001). This results in the two dependencies
vmod(stick, to) and pmod(to, nail), each of which
carries little semantic value over its key lexical
item, stick and nail, being combined into the sin-
gle, more expressive dependency vmod_to(stick,
nail), ultimately vmod is replaced with destination,
as described below. Likewise, the dependencies
connected by because are consolidated and be-
cause is integrated into the new dependency type.
Next, copulas and a few similar verbs are also
incorporated into the dependency types. The verb’s
predicate is reattached to its subject, which be-
comes the governor, and the dependency is labeled
with the verb’s root. In our example, the two se-
mantically impoverished dependencies sub(is,
ring) and prd(is, iron) are combined to form the
more meaningful dependency be(ring, iron). Then
terms of negation are similarly incorporated into
the dependency types.
Finally, wherever a shallow semantic parse
would identify a predicate argument structure, we
used the thematic role labels in VerbNet (Kipper et
al., 2000) between the predicate and the argu-
ment’s headword, rather than the MaltParser de-
pendency tags. This also involved adding new
structural dependencies that a typical dependency
parser would not generate. For example, in the sen-
tence As it freezes the water will expand and crack
the glass, typically the dependency between crack
and its subject water is not generated since it
would lead to a non-projective tree, but it does play
the role of Agent in a semantic parse. In a small
number of instances, these labels were also at-

<bodyText confidence="0.999985869565218">
tached to noun modifiers, most notably the Loca-
tion label. For example, given the reference answer
fragment The water on the floor had a much larger
surface area, one of the facets extracted was Loca-
tion_on(water, floor).
We refer to facets that express relations between
higher-level propositions as inter-propositional
facets. An example of such a facet is (1e) above,
connecting the proposition the brass ring did not
stick to the nail to the proposition the ring is not
iron. In addition to specifying the headwords of
inter-propositional facets (stick and is, in 1e), we
also note up to two key facets from each of the
propositions that the relation is connecting (b, c,
and d in example 1). Reference answer facets that
are assumed to be understood by the learner a pri-
ori, (e.g., because they are part of the question), are
also annotated to indicate this.
There were a total of 2878 reference answer fac-
ets, resulting in a mean of 10 facets per answer
(median 8). Facets that were assumed to be under-
stood a priori by students accounted for 33% of all
facets and inter-propositional facets accounted for
11%. The results of automated annotation of stu-
dent answers (section 3) focus on the facets that
are not assumed to be understood a priori (67% of
all facets); of these, 12% are inter-propositional.
A total of 36 different facet relation types were
utilized. The majority, 21, are VerbNet thematic
roles. Direction, Manner, and Purpose are Prop-
Bank adjunctive argument labels (Palmer et al.,
2005). Quantifier, Means, Cause-to-Know and
copulas were added to the preceding roles. Finally,
anything that did not fit into the above categories
retained its dependency parse type: VMod (Verb
Modifier), NMod (Noun Modifier), AMod (Adjec-
tive or Adverb Modifier), and Root (Root was used
when a single word in the answer, typically yes,
no, agree, disagree, A-D, etc., stood alone without
a significant relation to the remainder of the refer-
ence answer; this occurred only 21 times, account-
ing for fewer than 1% of the reference answer
facets). The seven highest frequency relations are
NMod, Theme, Cause, Be, Patient, AMod, and
Location, which together account for 70% of the
reference answer facet relations

For each student answer, we annotated each
reference answer facet to indicate whether and how
the student addressed that facet. We settled on the
five annotation categories in Table 1. These labels
and the annotation process are detailed in (Nielsen
et al., 2008b).

Understood: Reference answer facets directly ex-
pressed or whose understanding is inferred
Contradiction: Reference answer facets contradicted

Diff-Arg: Reference answer facets whose core relation
is expressed, but it has a different modifier or argument

3 Automated Classification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994787878788">
As partial validation of this knowledge representa-
tion, we present results of an automatic assessment
of our student answers. We start with the hand
generated reference answer facets. We generate
automatic parses for the reference answers and the
student answers and automatically modify these
parses to match our desired representation. Then
for each reference answer facet, we extract features
indicative of the student’s understanding of that
facet. Finally, we train a machine learning classi-
fier on training data and use it to classify unseen
test examples, assigning a Table 1 label for each
reference answer facet.
We used a variety of linguistic features that as-
sess the facets’ similarity via lexical entailment
probabilities following (Glickman et al., 2005),
part of speech tags and lexical stem matches. They
include information extracted from modified de-
pendency parses such as relevant relation types and
path edit distances. Revised dependency parses are
used to align the terms and facet-level information
for feature extraction. Remaining details can be
found in (Nielsen et al., 2008a) and are not central
to the semantic representation focus of this paper.
Current classification accuracy, assigning a Table
1 label to each reference answer facet to indicate
the student’s expressed understanding, is 79%
within domain (assessing unseen answers to ques-
tions associated with the training data) and 69%
out of domain (assessing answers to questions re-
garding entirely different science subjects). These
results are 26% and 15% over the majority class
baselines, respectively, and 21% and 6% over lexi-

4 Discussion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981037037037">
Analyzing the results of reference facet extraction,
there are many interesting open linguistic issues in
this area. This includes the need for a more
sophisticated treatment of adjectives, conjunctions,
plurals and quantifiers, all of which are known to
be beyond the abilities of state of the art parsers.
Analyzing the dependency parses of 51 of the
student answers, about 24% had errors that could
easily lead to problems in assessment. Over half of
these errors resulted from inopportune sentence
segmentation due to run-on student sentences con-
joined by and (e.g., the parse of a shorter string
makes a higher pitch and a longer string makes a
lower pitch, errantly conjoined a higher pitch and
a longer string as the subject of makes a lower
pitch, leaving a shorter string makes without an
object). We are working on approaches to mitigate
this problem.
In the long term, when the ITS generates its own
questions and reference answers, the system will
have to construct its own reference answer facets.
The automatic construction of reference answer
facets must deal with all of the issues described in
this paper and is a significant area of future
research. Other key areas of future research
involve integrating the representation described
here into an ITS and evaluating its impact.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999919375">
We presented a novel fine-grained semantic repre-
sentation and evaluated it in the context of auto-
mated tutoring. A significant contribution of this
representation is that it will facilitate more precise
tutor feedback, targeted to the specific facet of the
reference answer and pertaining to the specific
level of understanding expressed by the student.
This representation could also be useful in areas
such as question answering or document summari-
zation, where a series of entailed facets could be
composed to form a full answer or summary.
The representation’s validity is partially demon-
strated in the ability of annotators to reliably anno-
tate inferences at this facet level, achieving
substantial agreement (86%, Kappa=0.72) and by
promising results in automatic assessment of stu-
dent answers at this facet level (up to 26% over
baseline), particularly given that, in addition to the
manual reference answer facet representation, an
automatically extracted approximation of the rep-
resentation was a key factor in the features utilized
by the classifier.
The domain independent approach described
here enables systems that can easily scale up to
new content and learning environments, avoiding
the need for lesson planners or technologists to
create extensive new rules or classifiers for each
new question the system must handle. This is an
obligatory first step to the long-term goal of creat-
ing ITSs that can truly engage children in natural
unrestricted dialog, such as is required to perform
high quality student directed Socratic tutoring.
