Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999596631578948">
Lexical classes, when tailored to the appli-
cation and domain in question, can provide
an effective means to deal with a num-
ber of natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. While manual construction of such
classes is difficult, recent research shows
that it is possible to automatically induce
verb classes from cross-domain corpora
with promising accuracy. We report a
novel experiment where similar technol-
ogy is applied to the important, challeng-
ing domain of biomedicine. We show that
the resulting classification, acquired from
a corpus of biomedical journal articles,
is highly accurate and strongly domain-
specific. It can be used to aid BIO-NLP
directly or as useful material for investi-
gating the syntax and semantics of verbs
in biomedical texts.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999696277777778">
Lexical classes which capture the close relation
between the syntax and semantics of verbs have
attracted considerable interest in NLP (Jackendoff,
1990; Levin, 1993; Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al.,
2000). Such classes are useful for their ability to
capture generalizations about a range of linguis-
tic properties. For example, verbs which share the
meaning of ‘manner of motion’ (such as travel,
run, walk), behave similarly also in terms of
subcategorization (I traveled/ran/walked, I trav-
eled/ran/walked to London, I traveled/ran/walked
five miles). Although the correspondence between
the syntax and semantics of words is not perfect
and the classes do not provide means for full se-
mantic inferencing, their predictive power is nev-
ertheless considerable.
NLP systems can benefit from lexical classes
in many ways. Such classes define the mapping
from surface realization of arguments to predicate-
argument structure, and are therefore an impor-
tant component of any system which needs the
latter. As the classes can capture higher level
abstractions they can be used as a means to ab-
stract away from individual words when required.
They are also helpful in many operational contexts
where lexical information must be acquired from
small application-specific corpora. Their predic-
tive power can help compensate for lack of data
fully exemplifying the behavior of relevant words.
Lexical verb classes have been used to sup-
port various (multilingual) tasks, such as compu-
tational lexicography, language generation, ma-
chine translation, word sense disambiguation, se-
mantic role labeling, and subcategorization acqui-
sition (Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al., 2000; Korho-
nen, 2002). However, large-scale exploitation of
the classes in real-world or domain-sensitive tasks
has not been possible because the existing classi-
fications, e.g. (Levin, 1993), are incomprehensive
and unsuitable for specific domains.
While manual classification of large numbers of
words has proved difficult and time-consuming,
recent research shows that it is possible to auto-
matically induce lexical classes from corpus data
with promising accuracy (Merlo and Stevenson,
2001; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Ko-
rhonen et al., 2003). A number of ML methods
have been applied to classify words using features
pertaining to mainly syntactic structure (e.g. sta-
tistical distributions of subcategorization frames
(SCFs) or general patterns of syntactic behaviour,
e.g. transitivity, passivisability) which have been
extracted from corpora using e.g. part-of-speech
tagging or robust statistical parsing techniques.

This research has been encouraging but it has
so far concentrated on general language. Domain-
specific lexical classification remains unexplored,
although it is arguably important: existing clas-
sifications are unsuitable for domain-specific ap-
plications and these often challenging applications
might benefit from improved performance by uti-
lizing lexical classes the most.
In this paper, we extend an existing approach
to lexical classification (Korhonen et al., 2003)
and apply it (without any domain specific tun-
ing) to the domain of biomedicine. We focus on
biomedicine for several reasons: (i) NLP is criti-
cally needed to assist the processing, mining and
extraction of knowledge from the rapidly growing
literature in this area, (ii) the domain lexical re-
sources (e.g. UMLS metathesaurus and lexicon1)
do not provide sufficient information about verbs
and (iii) being linguistically challenging, the do-
main provides a good test case for examining the
potential of automatic classification.
We report an experiment where a classifica-
tion is induced for 192 relatively frequent verbs
from a corpus of 2230 biomedical journal articles.
The results, evaluated with domain experts, show
that the approach is capable of acquiring classes
with accuracy higher than that reported in previous
work on general language. We discuss reasons for
this and show that the resulting classes differ sub-
stantially from those in extant lexical resources.
They constitute the first syntactic-semantic verb
classification for the biomedical domain and could
be readily applied to support BIO-NLP.
We discuss the domain-specific issues related to
our task in section 2. The approach to automatic
classification is presented in section 3. Details of
the experimental evaluation are supplied in sec-
tion 4. Section 5 provides discussion and section
6 concludes with directions for future work.

2 The Biomedical Domain and Our Task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970092125">
Recent years have seen a massive growth in the
scientific literature in the domain of biomedicine.
For example, the MEDLINE database2 which cur-
rently contains around 16M references to journal
articles, expands with 0.5M new references each
year. Because future research in the biomedical
sciences depends on making use of all this existing
knowledge, there is a strong need for the develop-

ment of NLP tools which can be used to automat-
ically locate, organize and manage facts related to
published experimental results.
In recent years, major progress has been made
on information retrieval and on the extraction of
specific relations e.g. between proteins and cell
types from biomedical texts (Hirschman et al.,
2002). Other tasks, such as the extraction of fac-
tual information, remain a bigger challenge. This
is partly due to the challenging nature of biomedi-
cal texts. They are complex both in terms of syn-
tax and semantics, containing complex nominals,
modal subordination, anaphoric links, etc.
Researchers have recently began to use deeper
NLP techniques (e.g. statistical parsing) in the do-
main because they are not challenged by the com-
plex structures to the same extent than shallow
techniques (e.g. regular expression patterns) are
(Lease and Charniak, 2005). However, deeper
techniques require richer domain-specific lexical
information for optimal performance than is pro-
vided by existing lexicons (e.g. UMLS). This is
particularly important for verbs, which are central
to the structure and meaning of sentences.
Where the lexical information is absent, lexical
classes can compensate for it or aid in obtaining
it in the ways described in section 1. Consider
e.g. the INDICATE and ACTIVATE verb classes in
Figure 1. They capture the fact that their members
are similar in terms of syntax and semantics: they
have similar SCFs and selectional preferences, and
they can be used to make similar statements which
describe similar events. Such information can be
used to build a richer lexicon capable of support-
ing key tasks such as parsing, predicate-argument
identification, event extraction and the identifica-
tion of biomedical (e.g. interaction) relations.
While an abundance of work has been con-
ducted on semantic classification of biomedical
terms and nouns, less work has been done on the
(manual or automatic) semantic classification of
verbs in the biomedical domain (Friedman et al.,
2002; Hatzivassiloglou and Weng, 2002; Spasic et
al., 2005). No previous work exists in this domain
on the type of lexical (i.e. syntactic-semantic) verb
classification this paper focuses on.
To get an initial idea about the differences be-
tween our target classification and a general lan-
guage classification, we examined the extent to
which individual verbs and their frequencies dif-
fer in biomedical and general language texts. We

cles (see section 4.1 for details) and compared the
distribution of verbs in this corpus with that in the
British National Corpus (BNC) (Leech, 1992). We
calculated the Spearman rank correlation between
the 1165 verbs which occurred in both corpora.
The result was only a weak correlation: 0.37 f
0.03. When the scope was restricted to the 100
most frequent verbs in the biomedical data, the
correlation was 0.12 f 0.10 which is only 1.2Q
away from zero. The dissimilarity between the
distributions is further indicated by the Kullback-
Leibler distance of 0.97. Table 1 illustrates some
of these big differences by showing the list of 15

3 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998325">
We extended the system of Korhonen et al. (2003)
with additional clustering techniques (introduced
in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.4) and used it to ob-
tain the classification for the biomedical domain.
The system (i) extracts features from corpus data
and (ii) clusters them using five different methods.
These steps are described in the following two sec-
tions, respectively.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997565">
3.1 Feature Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942823529412">
We employ as features distributions of SCFs spe-
cific to given verbs. We extract them from cor-
pus data using the comprehensive subcategoriza-
tion acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll
(1997) (Korhonen, 2002). The system incorpo-
rates RASP, a domain-independent robust statis-
tical parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002), which
tags, lemmatizes and parses data yielding com-
plete though shallow parses and a SCF classifier
which incorporates an extensive inventory of 163
verbal SCFs3. The SCFs abstract over specific
lexically-governed particles and prepositions and
specific predicate selectional preferences. In our
work, we parameterized two high frequency SCFs
for prepositions (PP and NP + PP SCFs). No filter-
ing of potentially noisy SCFs was done to provide
clustering with as much information as possible.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996081">
3.2 Classification

<bodyText confidence="0.99976">
The SCF frequency distributions constitute the in-
put data to automatic classification. We experi-
ment with five clustering methods: the simple hard
nearest neighbours method and four probabilis-
tic methods – two variants of Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis and two information theoretic
methods (the Information Bottleneck and the In-
formation Distortion).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.802551">
3.2.1 Nearest Neighbours
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992444444445">
The first method collects the nearest neighbours
(NN) of each verb. It (i) calculates the Jensen-
Shannon divergence (JS) between the SCF distri-
butions of each pair of verbs, (ii) connects each
verb with the most similar other verb, and finally
(iii) finds all the connected components. The NN
method is very simple. It outputs only one clus-
tering configuration and therefore does not allow
examining different cluster granularities.

3.2.2 Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999685">
The Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
(PLSA, Hoffman (2001)) assumes a generative
model for the data, defined by selecting (i) a verb
verbi, (ii) a semantic class classk from the dis-
tribution p(Classes  |verbi), and (iii) a SCF scfj
from the distribution p(SCFs  |classk). PLSA uses
Expectation Maximization (EM) to find the dis-
tribution p(SCFs  |Clusters, Verbs) which max-
imises the likelihood of the observed counts. It
does this by minimising the cost function

For Q = 1 minimising F is equivalent to the stan-
dard EM procedure while for Q &lt; 1 the distri-
bution p� tends to be more evenly spread. We use
Q = 1 (PLSA/EM) and Q = 0.75 (PLSAO=0.75).
We currently “harden” the output and assign each
verb to the most probable cluster only4.

3.2.3 Information Bottleneck
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999745">
The Information Bottleneck (Tishby et al.,
1999) (IB) is an information-theoretic method
which controls the balance between: (i) the
loss of information by representing verbs as
clusters (I(Clusters;Verbs)), which has to be
minimal, and (ii) the relevance of the output
clusters for representing the SCF distribution
(I(Clusters; SCFs)) which has to be maximal.
The balance between these two quantities ensures
optimal compression of data through clusters. The
trade-off between the two constraints is realized
through minimising the cost function:

<equation confidence="0.9994045">
GIB = I(Clusters;Verbs)
− ,N(Clusters; SCFs) ,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935181818182">
where Q is a parameter that balances the con-
straints. IB takes three inputs: (i) SCF-verb dis-
tributions, (ii) the desired number of clusters K,
and (iii) the initial value of Q. It then looks for
the minimal Q that decreases LIB compared to its
value with the initial Q, using the given K. IB de-
livers as output the probabilities p(K|V ). It gives
an indication for the most informative number of
output configurations: the ones for which the rele-
vance information increases more sharply between
K − 1 and K clusters than between K and K + 1.

3.2.4 Information Distortion

<bodyText confidence="0.99953575">
The Information Distortion method (Dimitrov
and Miller, 2001) (ID) is otherwise similar to IB
but LID differs from LIB by an additional term that
adds a bias towards clusters of similar size:

4.3 Gold Standard

<bodyText confidence="0.9999422">
Because no target lexical classification was avail-

domain experts and 2 linguists) were used to cre-
ate the gold standard. They were asked to examine
whether the test verbs similar in terms of their syn-
tactic properties (i.e. verbs with similar SCF distri-
butions) are similar also in terms of semantics (i.e.
they share a common meaning). Where this was
the case, a verb class was identified and named.
The domain experts examined the 116 verbs
whose analysis required domain knowledge
(e.g. activate, solubilize, harvest), while the lin-
guists analysed the remaining 76 general or scien-
tific text verbs (e.g. demonstrate, hypothesize, ap-
pear). The linguists used Levin (1993) classes as
gold standard classes whenever possible and cre-
ated novel ones when needed. The domain ex-
perts used two purely semantic classifications of
biomedical verbs (Friedman et al., 2002; Spasic et

pairwise similarities, NN shows mostly better per-
formance than IB and ID on the pairwise measure
APP but the global measures are better for IB and
ID. The differences are smaller in MPUR (yet sig-
nificant: 2Q between NN and IB and 3Q between
NN and ID) but more notable in ACC (which is
e.g. 8 − 12% better for IB than for NN). Also
the F results suggest that the two information the-
oretic methods are better overall than the simple
NN method.
IB and ID also have the advantage (over NN) that
they can be used to produce a hierarchical verb
classification. Table 4 shows the results for IB and
ID for the informative values of K. The bold font
indicates the results when the match between the
values of K and the number of classes at the par-
ticular level of the gold standard is the closest.
IB is clearly better than ID at all levels of gold
standard. It yields its best results at the medium
level (34 classes) with K = 33: F = 77 and APP
= 69 (the results for ID are F = 72 and APP =
65). At the most fine-grained level (50 classes),
IB is equally good according to F with K = 33,
but APP is 8% lower. Although ID is occasion-
ally better than IB according to APP and MPUR
(see e.g. the results for 16 classes with K = 53)
this never happens in the case where the corre-
spondence between the number of gold standard
classes and the values of K is the closest. In other
words, the informative values of K prove really
informative for IB. The lower performance of ID
seems to be due to its tendency to create evenly
sized clusters.
All the methods perform significantly better
than our random baseline. The significance of the
results with respect to two swaps was at the 2Q
level, corresponding to a 97% confidence that the
results are above random.

4.6 Qualitative Evaluation

We performed further, qualitative analysis of clus-
ters produced by the best performing method IB.
Consider the following clusters:
A: inject, transfect, microinfect, contransfect (6)
B: harvest, select, collect (7.1)
centrifuge, process, recover (7.2)
C: wash, rinse (4.1.1)
immunoblot (4.1.3)
overlap (5)
D: activate (1.1.1)
When looking at coarse-grained outputs, in-
terestingly, K as low as 8 learned the broad
distinction between biomedical and general lan-
guage verbs (the two verb types appeared only
rarely in the same clusters) and produced large se-
mantically meaningful groups of classes (e.g. the
coarse-grained classes EXPERIMENTAL PROCE-
DURES, TRANSFECT and COLLECT were mapped
together). K = 12 was sufficient to iden-
tify several classes with very particular syntax
One of them was TRANSFECT (see A above)
whose members were distinguished easily be-
cause of their typical SCFs (e.g. inject /trans-
fect/microinfect/contransfect X with/into Y).
On the other hand, even K = 53 could not iden-
tify classes with very similar (yet un-identical)
syntax. These included many semantically similar
sub-classes (e.g. the two sub-classes of COLLECT

PP SCFs). However, also a few semantically dif-
ferent verbs clustered wrongly because of this rea-
son, such as the ones exemplified in C. In C, im-
munoblot (from the LABEL class) is still somewhat
related to wash and rinse (the WASH class) because
they all belong to the larger EXPERIMENTAL PRO-
CEDURES class, but overlap (from the PROCESS
class) shows up in the cluster merely because of
syntactic idiosyncracy.
While parser errors caused by the challeng-
ing biomedical texts were visible in some SCFs
(e.g. looking at a sample of SCFs, some adjunct
instances were listed in the argument slots of the
frames), the cases where this resulted in incorrect
classification were not numerous11.
One representative singleton resulting from
these errors is exemplified in D. Activate ap-
pears in relatively complicated sentence struc-
tures, which gives rise to incorrect SCFs. For ex-
ample, MECs cultured on 2D planar substrates

<bodyText confidence="0.999764303571429">
Due to differences in the task and experimental
setup, direct comparison of our results with pre-
viously published ones is impossible. The clos-
est possible comparison point is (Korhonen et al.,
2003) which reported 50-59% mPUR and 15-19%
APP on using IB to assign 110 polysemous (gen-
eral language) verbs into 34 classes. Our results
are substantially better, although we made no ef-
fort to restrict our scope to monosemous verbs12
and although we focussed on a linguistically chal-
lenging domain.
It seems that our better result is largely due
to the higher uniformity of verb senses in the
biomedical domain. We could not investigate this
effect systematically because no manually sense
11This is partly because the mistakes of the parser are
somewhat consistent (similar for similar verbs) and partly be-
cause the SCFs gather data from hundreds of corpus instances,
many of which are analysed correctly.
12Most of our test verbs are polysemous according to
WordNet (WN) (Miller, 1990), but this is not a fully reliable
indication because WN is not specific to this domain.
annotated data (or a comprehensive list of verb
senses) exists for the domain. However, exami-
nation of a number of corpus instances suggests
that the use of verbs is fairly conventionalized in
our data13. Where verbs show less sense varia-
tion, they show less SCF variation, which aids the
discovery of verb classes. Korhonen et al. (2003)
observed the opposite with general language data.
We examined, class by class, to what extent our
domain-specific gold standard differs from the re-
lated general (Levin, 1993) and domain classifica-
tions (Spasic et al., 2005; Friedman et al., 2002)
(recall that the latter were purely semantic clas-
sifications as no lexical ones were available for
biomedicine):
33 (of the 50) classes in the gold standard are
biomedical. Only 6 of these correspond (fully or
mostly) to the semantic classes in the domain clas-
sifications. 17 are unrelated to any of the classes in
Levin (1993) while 16 bear vague resemblance to
them (e.g. our TRANSPORT verbs are also listed
under Levin’s SEND verbs) but are too different
(semantically and syntactically) to be combined.
17 (of the 50) classes are general (scientific)
classes. 4 of these are absent in Levin (e.g. QUAN-
TITATE). 13 are included in Levin, but 8 of them
have a more restricted sense (and fewer members)
than the corresponding Levin class. Only the re-
maining 5 classes are identical (in terms of mem-
bers and their properties) to Levin classes.
These results highlight the importance of build-
ing or tuning lexical resources specific to different
domains, and demonstrate the usefulness of auto-
matic lexical acquisition for this work.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9265018">
This paper has shown that current domain-
independent NLP and ML technology can be used
to automatically induce a relatively high accu-
racy verb classification from a linguistically chal-
lenging corpus of biomedical texts. The lexical
classification resulting from our work is strongly
domain-specific (it differs substantially from pre-
vious ones) and it can be readily used to aid BIO-
NLP. It can provide useful material for investigat-
ing the syntax and semantics of verbs in biomed-
ical data or for supplementing existing domain
lexical resources with additional information (e.g.
13The different sub-domains of the biomedical domain
may, of course, be even more conventionalized (Friedman et
al., 2002).

semantic classifications with additional member
verbs). Lexical resources enriched with verb class
information can, in turn, better benefit practical
tasks such as parsing, predicate-argument identifi-
cation, event extraction, identification of biomedi-
cal relation patterns, among others.
In the future, we plan to improve the accu-
racy of automatic classification by seeding it with
domain-specific information (e.g. using named en-
tity recognition and anaphoric linking techniques
similar to those of Vlachos et al. (2006)). We also
plan to conduct a bigger experiment with a larger
number of verbs and demonstrate the usefulness of
the bigger classification for practical BIO-NLP ap-
plication tasks. In addition, we plan to apply sim-
ilar technology to other interesting domains (e.g.
tourism, law, astronomy). This will not only en-
able us to experiment with cross-domain lexical
class variation but also help to determine whether
automatic acquisition techniques benefit, in gen-
eral, from domain-specific tuning.

It then looks for the minimal Q that decreases LIB compared to its value with the initial Q, using the given K. IB delivers as output the probabilities p(K|V ). It gives an indication for the most informative number of output configurations: the ones for which the relevance information increases more sharply between K − 1 and K clusters than between K and K + 1. 3.2.4 Information Distortion The Information Distortion method (Dimitrov and Miller, 2001) (ID) is otherwise similar to IB but LID differs from LIB by an additional term that adds a bias towards clusters of similar size: GID = −H(Clusters |Verbs) − ,N(Clusters; SCFs) = GIB − H(Clusters) .

Such classes are useful for their ability to capture generalizations about a range of linguistic properties. For example, verbs which share the meaning of ‘manner of motion’ (such as travel, run, walk), behave similarly also in terms of subcategorization (I traveled/ran/walked, I traveled/ran/walked to London, I traveled/ran/walked five miles). Although the correspondence between the syntax and semantics of words is not perfect and the classes do not provide means for full semantic inferencing, their predictive power is nevertheless considerable. NLP systems can benef</context>

They are also helpful in many operational contexts where lexical information must be acquired from small application-specific corpora. Their predictive power can help compensate for lack of data fully exemplifying the behavior of relevant words. Lexical verb classes have been used to support various (multilingual) tasks, such as computational lexicography, language generation, machine translation, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, and subcategorization acquisition (Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al., 2000; Korhonen, 2002). However, large-scale exploitation of the classes in real-world or domain-sensitive tasks has not been possible because the existing classifications, e.g. (Levin, 1993), are incomprehensive and unsuitable for specific domains. While manual classification of large numbers of words has proved difficult and time-consuming, recent research shows that it is possible to automatically induce lexical classes from corpus data with promising accuracy (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003).

Where this was the case, a verb class was identified and named. The domain experts examined the 116 verbs whose analysis required domain knowledge (e.g. activate, solubilize, harvest), while the linguists analysed the remaining 76 general or scientific text verbs (e.g. demonstrate, hypothesize, appear). The linguists used Levin (1993) classes as gold standard classes whenever possible and created novel ones when needed.

However, examination of a number of corpus instances suggests that the use of verbs is fairly conventionalized in our data13. Where verbs show less sense variation, they show less SCF variation, which aids the discovery of verb classes. Korhonen et al. (2003) observed the opposite with general language data. We examined, class by class, to what extent our domain-specific gold standard differs from the related general (Levin, 1993) and domain classifications (Spasic et al., 2005; Friedman et al., 2002) (recall that the latter were purely semantic classifications as no lexical ones were available for biomedicine): 33 (of the 50) classes in the gold standard are biomedical. Only 6 of these correspond (fully or mostly) to the semantic classes in the domain classifications. 17 are unrelated to any of the classes in Levin (1993) while 16 bear vague resemblance to them (e.g. our TRANSPORT verbs are also listed under Levin’s SEND verbs) but are too different (semantically and syntactically) to be combined. 17 (of the 50) classes are general (scientific) classes. 4 of these are absent in Levin (e.g</context>

In recent years, major progress has been made on information retrieval and on the extraction of specific relations e.g. between proteins and cell types from biomedical texts (Hirschman et al., 2002). Other tasks, such as the extraction of factual information, remain a bigger challenge. This is partly due to the challenging nature of biomedical texts. They are complex both in terms of syntax and semantics, containing complex nominals, modal subordination, anaphoric links, etc. Researchers have recently began to use deeper NLP techniques (e.g. statistical parsing) in the domain because they are not challenged by the complex structures to the same extent than shallow techniques (e.g. regular expression patterns) are (Lease and Charniak, 2005).

It (i) calculates the JensenShannon divergence (JS) between the SCF distributions of each pair of verbs, (ii) connects each verb with the most similar other verb, and finally (iii) finds all the connected components. The NN method is very simple. It outputs only one clustering configuration and therefore does not allow examining different cluster granularities. 3.2.2 Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis The Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA, Hoffman (2001)) assumes a generative model for the data, defined by selecting (i) a verb verbi, (ii) a semantic class classk from the distribution p(Classes |verbi), and (iii) a SCF scfj from the distribution p(SCFs |classk). PLSA uses Expectation Maximization (EM) to find the distribution p(SCFs |Clusters, Verbs) which maximises the likelihood of the observed counts.

Such classes are useful for their ability to capture generalizations about a range of linguistic properties.

However, deeper techniques require richer domain-specific lexical information for optimal performance than is provided by existing lexicons (e.g. UMLS). This is particularly important for verbs, which are central to the structure and meaning of sentences.

Where this was the case, a verb class was identified and named. The domain experts examined the 116 verbs whose analysis required domain knowledge (e.g. activate, solubilize, harvest), while the linguists analysed the remaining 76 general or scientific text verbs (e.g. demonstrate, hypothesize, appear).

We report a novel experiment where similar technology is applied to the important, challenging domain of biomedicine. We show that the resulting classification, acquired from a corpus of biomedical journal articles, is highly accurate and strongly domainspecific. It can be used to aid BIO-NLP directly or as useful material for investigating the syntax and semantics of verbs in biomedical texts. 1 Introduction Lexical classes which capture the close relation between the syntax and semantics of verbs have attracted considerable interest in NLP (Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993; Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al., 2000). Such classes are useful for their ability to capture generalizations about a range of linguistic properties. For example, verbs which share the meaning of ‘manner of motion’ (such as travel, run, walk), behave similarly also in terms of subcategorization (I traveled/ran/walked, I traveled/ran/walked to London, I traveled/ran/walked five miles). Although the correspondence between the syntax and semantics of words is not perfect and the classes do not provide means for full semantic inferencing, their predictive power is nevertheless considerable. NLP systems can benefit from lexical classes </context>

They are also helpful in many operational contexts where lexical information must be acquired from small application-specific corpora. Their predictive power can help compensate for lack of data fully exemplifying the behavior of relevant words. Lexical verb classes have been used to support various (multilingual) tasks, such as computational lexicography, language generation, machine translation, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, and subcategorization acquisition (Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al., 2000; Korhonen, 2002). However, large-scale exploitation of the classes in real-world or domain-sensitive tasks has not been possible because the existing classifications, e.g. (Levin, 1993), are incomprehensive and unsuitable for specific domains.

Such information can be used to build a richer lexicon capable of supporting key tasks such as parsing, predicate-argument identification, event extraction and the identification of biomedical (e.g. interaction) relations. While an abundance of work has been conducted on semantic classification of biomedical terms and nouns, less work has been done on the (manual or automatic) semantic classification of verbs in the biomedical domain (Friedman et al., 2002; Hatzivassiloglou and Weng, 2002; Spasic et al., 2005). No previous work exists in this domain on the type of lexical (i.e. syntactic-semantic) verb classification this paper focuses on. To get an initial idea about the differences between our target classification and a general language classification, we examined the extent to which individual verbs and their frequencies differ in biomedical and general language texts.

Where this was the case, a verb class was identified and named. The domain experts examined the 116 verbs whose analysis required domain knowledge (e.g. activate, solubilize, harvest), while the linguists analysed the remaining 76 general or scientific text verbs (e.g. demonstrate, hypothesize, appear). The linguists used Levin (1993) classes as gold standard classes whenever possible and created novel ones when needed. The domain experts used two purely semantic classifications of biomedical verbs (Friedman et al., 2002; Spasic et al., 2005)7 as a starting point where this was pos5230 verbs were employed initially but 38 were dropped later so that each (coarse-grained) class would have the minimum of 2 members in the gold standard. 6This number is high because no filtering of potentially noisy SCFs was done. 7See http://www.cbr-masterclass.org. 348 1 Have an effect on activity (BIO/29) 8 Physical Relation Between Molecules (BIO/20) 1.1 Activate/ Inactivate 1.1.1 Change activity: activate, inhibit 1.1.2 Suppress: suppress, repress 1.1.3 Stimulate: stimulate 1.1.4 Inactivate: delay, diminish 1.2 Affect 1.2.1 Modulate: stabilize, mo</context>

The balance between these two quantities ensures optimal compression of data through clusters. The trade-off between the two constraints is realized through minimising the cost function: GIB = I(Clusters;Verbs) − ,N(Clusters; SCFs) , where Q is a parameter that balances the constraints</context>

Lexical resources enriched with verb class information can, in turn, better benefit practical tasks such as parsing, predicate-argument identification, event extraction, identification of biomedical relation patterns, among others. In the future, we plan to improve the accuracy of automatic classification by seeding it with domain-specific information (e.g. using named entity recognition and anaphoric linking techniques similar to those of Vlachos et al. (2006)). We also plan to conduct a bigger experiment with a larger number of verbs and demonstrate the usefulness of the bigger classification for practical BIO-NLP application tasks. In addition, we plan to apply similar technology to other interesting domains (e.g. tourism, law, astronomy). This will not only enable us to experiment with cross-domain lexical class variation but also help to determine whether automatic acquisition techniques benefit, in general, from domain-specific tuning.
