The lexicons for Knowledge-Based Machine
Translation systems require knowledge in-
tensive morphological, syntactic and se-
mantic information. This information is of-
ten used in different ways and usually for-
matted for a specific NLP system. This
tends to make both the acquisition and
maintenance of lexical databases cumber-
some, inefficient and error-prone. In order
to solve these problems, we have developed
a program called COOL which automates
the acquisition and maintenance processes
and allows us to standardize and central-
ize the databases. This system is currently
being used in the ESTRATO machine trans-
lation project at the Center for Machine
Translation.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99991405">
In this paper, we describe a fully-implemented rule-
based system for the semi-automatic acquisition
and maintenance of lexical and semantic knowledge
in a knowledge-based machine translation system.
This rule-based system is called COOL: creator of
ontologies and Lexicons. COOL can create and up-
date various lexical and semantic knowledge sources
for different NLP modules.
COOL is a working system that was developed for
ESTRATO (EScue/a de TRAductores de TOledo), a
joint project of the Center for Machine Translation
at CMU and Union Electrica Fenosa, an electric util-
ity company in Madrid, Spain. ESTRATO is a system
for translating Spanish to English in a restricted do-
main with controlled input. ESTRATO consists of sev-
eral modules from the KANT MT system [Mitamura
et al., 1991] as well as morphological analysis and
phrasal recognition modules and the TWS authoring
environment[Nirenburg et al., 19921.
As shown in figure 1, every ESTRATO run-time
module uses a different lexical or semantic knowledge
source, which differs in content as well as format.
The knowledge contained in these modules overlaps.
We needed to coordinate and maintain these know-
ledge sources in a robust and efficient way. Further-
more, the lexical information needed by the trans-
lator is initially acquired by people (&amp;quot;editors&amp;quot;) who
are neither linguists nor domain experts. This lex-
ical information is kept in lexical feature files.1 We
needed a way to convert these lexical feature files into
forms which could be used by the run-time modules
of ESTRATO.
Our solution is to maintain a centralized lexical
and semantic frame database, and to use COOL to
help us acquire this database by converting the iniz
tial feature files created by the human editors. The
lexical and semantic knowledge sources needed by
the run-time translator are then automatically gener-
ated and maintained by COOL. Two subsystems per-
form these tasks: ACQUISITION-COOL (A-COOL) and

the central lexical and template semantic databases
from the initial lexical feature files, which the linguist
and domain expert can then modify. M-COOL goes
beyond simple acquisition of lexical information. It
automatically generates efficient run-time versions of

repository of lexical and semantic databases initially

created by A-COOL and maintained by experts. The
relationship between A-COOL, M-COOL and the three
different types of information is depicted in figure 2.
COOL maintains consistency in the knowledge
sources and makes it easy to add lexical databases
for new modules. By keeping a single source for all
lexical information for a given language, COOL allows
us to robustly maintain knowledge and eliminate re-
dundancy, by using the power of a frame-based rule
language.
First we describe the acquisition and maintenance
problems in more detail, and then describe the A-
COOL and M-COOL tools which we developed to solve
these problems. We also look at related efforts, and
mention some ideas for future work.

2 The Knowledge Acquisition and
Maintenance Problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999786410714286">
At the Center for Machine Translation, we use Lex-
ical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Kaplan Bresnan,
19821 as a basis for our syntactic grammars as well
as our linking rules [Levin, 1987] for mapping syn-
tactic functions to and from semantic roles. The lat-
ter we refer to as &amp;quot;mapping rules&amp;quot;. These mapping
rules are used in conjunction with a domain model
to build or generate from the interlingua text rep-
resentations (ILT). The use of ILT is characteristic
of the CMT approach to Knowledge-Based Machine
Translation [Goodman, 1991; Mitamura et al., 1991;
Frederking et al., 1992].
Given the emphasis placed on the lexicon in LFG
in both syntax and semantics and the extensive do-
main knowledge required for our translation system,
we place a great deal of importance on the lexicon
and finding easy methods to acquire, maintain, view,
store and reuse the lexical information. COOL is a
tool we are developing and using on the ESTRATO
project for accomplishing these tasks.
The knowledge acquisition and maintenance tasks
can be rather cumbersome. Acquiring 1000&apos;s of new
semantic concepts and placing them into the top-
level semantic hierarchy by hand is tedious and error-
prone. This also applies to adding English and Span-
ish words. Once the run-time knowledge sources for
the various NLP modules have been acquired, main-
taining consistency among the lexical and semantic
files (phrasal-noun list, glossary, morpho-syntactic
lexicons, word-to-concept mappings and the seman-
tic concepts) is difficult. The NLP modules require
different lexical and semantic knowledge with vary-
ing formats. All modules share some information
which must be kept consistent, such as the part
of speech and the word-sense. The concept name
must be the same for the run-time semantic know-
ledge source, the Spanish run-time lexical knowledge
source, and the English run-time lexical knowledge
source. Both acquiring the knowledge and maintain-
ing consistency in the knowledge are prone to human
error.
One of the requirements of ESTRATO is that a non-
linguist lexicographer be able to acquire and main-
tain lexical information as much as possible. A-COOL
allows the semi-automatic creation of NLP lexical
knowledge from lexicographic information supplied
by a non-linguist.
At present, linguists must do some of the lexi-
cal acquistion work such as providing semantic class
information and some specialized syntactic infor-
mation for closed-class items, adjectives and verbs.
When there is not always a one-to-one lexical map-
ping from a Spanish and English word to the same
concept [Talmy, 1972; Talmy, 1985], the lexical en-
tries can only be produced semi-automatically. Lin-
guists must also provide collocational information in

3 Automated Knowledge Acquisition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970241379311">
A-COOL automates the acquisition of lexical and se-
mantic knowledge in ESTRATO. For each entry in
a Spanish lexical feature file, A-COOL creates: a
new semantic concept frame for the central seman-
tic database, a Spanish lexical frame for the Spanish
central lexical database and a skeletal entry for the
English lexical feature file. Once the entry from the
English lexical feature file has been filled out by the
editor, A-COOL will also create a lexical frame for
the English central lexical database. The word-to-
concept mappings for the Spanish and English words
are automatically created by A-COOL in order to en-
sure consistency. A-COOL accomplishes all of this by
means of easily modified if-then rules.
When A-COOL creates a new concept, it automat-
ically makes a link to a more general semantic class.
The top-level hierarchy we are currently using was
created at Carnegie Mellon University [Carlson and
Nirenburg, 1990]. The insertion of semantic concepts
into a hierarchy is not dependent on the specific top-
level. The rules specify the linking of the new con-
cepts in the semantic hierarchy based on features
(such as ACTION for verbs and ANIMACY for nouns) in
the lexical feature files. These rules can be modified
easily for adding concepts to a different top-level.
What follows is a description of the A-COOL pro-
cess using the entry for the Spanish verb &amp;quot;funcionar&amp;quot;
(&amp;quot;to work&amp;quot;). The verb feature ACTION in the lexical
acquisition phase is designed such that the user is

prompted for a response to a question about the type
of action the verb represents (if any at all). With
this information, A-COOL can produce the prelimi-
nary value of IS-A for a semantic frame when it cre-
ates the semantic frame from the verb entry.
The &amp;quot;if&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;LHS&amp;quot; (left-hand-side) part of the
A-COOL rules specifies properties of lexical features
which must be true for the rule to apply. If the rule
does apply, the &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;RHS&amp;quot; (right-hand-side)
specifies which slots of the central database frame to
create.
For example, figure 3 shows entries for the Spanish
verb &amp;quot;funcionar&amp;quot; and its corresponding English verb
&amp;quot;work&amp;quot; from the lexical feature files.
In order to convert these entries into central
database frames, the following rules apply. rulel
inserts the default information that the value of the
CLASS feature for &amp;quot;funcionar&amp;quot; is AGENT, because the

reflexive value is unknown (see figure 4). It also in-
serts the word into the lexical hierarchy under +w-
SPANISH-INTRANS-VERB and copies the TRANS infor-
mation to the new frame.
Similarly, rule2 (see figure 5) helps to convert
&amp;quot;work&amp;quot; by guessing at the value of the TRANS slot
and setting the CLASS to AGENT-THEME.
Finally, rule3 (see figure 6) helps to generate the
template semantic frame corresponding to the mean-
ing of &amp;quot;funcionar&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; by placing the frame
under PHYSICAL-EVENT in the semantic IS-A hierar-
chy.
A-COOL works by using the following algorithm:

databases). Thus, the lexical information is not
spread out over several files and can be modified eas-
ily. Each language&apos;s lexicon can also be organized
hierarchically.
Using a set of if-then rules, M-COOL automatically
produces the necessary run-time lexical and seman-
tic knowledge sources for the various NLP modules.
These rules specify which features are needed for the
different modules. The rules also create some lexical
knowledge that can be extracted from the lexical and
semantic hierarchies. This information need not be
specified in the lexical entries.2
Since the various run-time lexical and semantic
knowledge sources now come from common central
databases, consistency is maintained and human er-
ror is minimized. Both the semantic knowledge and
the lexical knowledge are stored in a standard frame-
based format. This allows the linguist and domain-
expert to view or modify the knowledge with a frame-
based editor.
The rest of this section describes the M-COOL pro-
gram, the lexical and semantic frames used by 1%4-

trate how M-COOL works.

adds a small number of lexical or semantic items,
the incremental version of M-COOL will only update
the run-time knowledge sources which are affected
by the changes, instead of re-generating all of the
run-time knowledge sources. This saves considerable
time over the non-incremental method.
M-COOL works by first determining which run-time
knowledge sources need to be updated. For each such
knowledge source, it then applies all rules which are
relevant to that knowledge source. Each rule is as-
sociated with a specific knowledge source.
To extend M-COOL to generate the run-time know-
ledge source for a new NLP module, two steps are
taken:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.906865333333333">
1. Define the properties of the new knowledge
source in the file-type table.
2. Write a new set of rules for generating the en-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.940857833333333">
tries which comprise the new knowledge source.
These rules specify the lexical features to be
used for the entry as well as the format of the
entry.
The file-type table simply tells M-COOL whether
the given knowledge source is lexical or semantic,
and whether it is for generation or analysis. It
also supplies miscellaneous information such as the
name of the file where the run-time entries are kept
and whether it can be compiled using the LISP
compile command. For example, our Spanish-
lexical-analysis file-type is defined with this entry:

<bodyText confidence="0.999907777777778">
The rule language used by M-COOL is called
FRULEKIT [Shell and Carbonell, 1986]. FRULEKIT is
an efficient CommonLisp pattern matcher with sev-
eral extensions over ops-5. The most relevant exten-
sion is that it allows rules to flexibly match against
and modify frames in a hierarchy. Having such a
frame-based rule language makes it easy for us to
write rules to update the ESTRATO runtime know-
ledge sources.

Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919538461538">
Let us briefly discuss the lexical and semantic
database files which are the input to M-COOL. The
lexical frames are the repository of all lexical know-
ledge for the ESTRATO system. These frames contain
structural, grammatical and some semantic encod-
ing information for words or phrases. They can be
easily extended to include other lexical information
(e.g., definitions or synonyms) for display to a hu-
man translator. For the purposes of ESTRATO, each
lexical entry contains a part of speech (cAT), a lex-
ical mapping rule (HEAD or SEM-MAP), a root form
(Rour) and a link (Is-A) to its location in the lex-
ical hierarchy. Nouns (CAT N) contain agreement

(GENDER and NUMBER) count/mass (couNT) and
a trinary distinction of ANIMACY (human, animal,
non-living). Morphological information for Span-
ish is represented in the feature STEM-CHANGE and
for both Spanish and English in the features ALLO-
FLAG and IRREGULARS. Verbs and adjectives contain
features for subcategorization (TRANS, COMP-TYPE)
and features for syntactic-semantic argument link-
ing (CLASS, MAPPINGS). CLASS here refers to the
type of linking rules a verb or adjective [Levin and
Rappaport, 19871 will use for its syntactic arguments
(suBJ, OBJ, OBJ2, XCOMP, and COMP [Kaplan Bres-
nan, 1982]). Semantic knowledge about the world
is stored in a domain model organized in an is-a
hierarchy using frames that correspond to the var-
ious events (PHYSICAL-EVENT *ASSEMBLE-MONTAR)
and objects (PHYSICAL-OBJECT *TRANSFORMER-
TRANSFORMADOR), relations (AGENT, THEME)3 be-
tween these objects and events and properties
(COLOR, SHAPE) in the specific domain[Carlson and
Nirenburg, 19901. The name of each lexical frame
represents a single word sense [Meyer et al., 1992].
Examples of lexical frames are shown in figure 7.
Each frame specifies a link to a parent in the lexi-
cal hierarchy or the domain model hierarchy (IS-A).
This allows lexical entries to be arranged into classes
which require similar &amp;quot;mapping rules&amp;quot; [Mitamura,
1989].
Each semantic knowledge database frame in the
domain model also specifies the roles which a given
concept may have as well as specific restrictions on
the fillers of those roles. An example of a semantic
frame was shown in figure 7. The information in the
databases is used in different forms and combinations
depending on the NLP component&apos;s needs.

tive English lexical entry for the concept *WORK-
FUNCIONAR.

Now we will illustrate how M-COOL rules auto-
matically generate various types of run-time know-
ledge from the frames shown in figure 7. Figure 9
shows a rule for generating lexical mapping informa-
tion. This rule applies to the lexical frame -FW-SP-
FUNCIONAR-V-2 in order to generate the run-time
lexical analysis mapping data depicted in figure 10.
Next we have a rule for generating the run-time
Ontology database, which we call &amp;quot;framettes&amp;quot; (fig-
ure 11). This rule applies to the semantic frame
*WORK-FUNCIONAR (shown in figure 7) to generate
the framette as shown in figure 12.
The two previous rules were fairly simple, but N4-
COOL can perform much more complex computa-
tions. For example, in order to generate efficient run-
time knowledge which allows the translator to map
from interlingua into English feature-structures, N4-
COOL must find, for each semantic frame, every En-
glish lexical frame which corresponds to it. It then
combines this correspondence information into a sin-
gle LISP function which will efficiently perform the
mapping at run-time. One of the M-COOL rules re-
sponsible for constructing this knowledge is shown
in figure 13. In this example, it applies to the se-
mantic frame *WORK-FUNCIONAR. It finds two lex-

Most of the effort in developing software tools for
NLP has focused on user interfaces and acquisition
of lexical databases from text corpora, but there are
very few rule-based systems for knowledge mainte-
nance. [Pin-Ngern et al., 1989] go beyond corpus
analysis by augmenting the lexical databases with
knowledge supplied by human editors. The Word
Manager [Domenig, 19881 is a system for both acqui-
sition and maintenance of morphological knowledge,
but its main strength is its user-interface. LUKE
[Knight, 19911 is an interactive system which uses
several heuristics exploiting the relationship between
linguistic and world knowledge to partially automate
the acquisition process.
More effort has gone into the acquisition and main-
tenance of knowledge for expert-systems.4 The fo-
cus of such efforts is to acquire smaller amounts of
problem-solving knowledge, which is more complex
than the semantic and lexical knowledge used in ES-
TRATO .

We intend to extend COOL in three directions: by
supporting the acquisition and maintenance of lexi-

adding rules for completely automating the acquis-

improving the functionality of the underlying system
itself. Because it is easy to extend M-COOL to gen-
erate run-time knowledge sources for new modules,
we plan to add, for example: English-analysis lexical
tables, Spanish-generation lexical tables, and lexical
tables for an external machine-translation system.
We also have plans for integrating the various
acquisition and maintenance tools we use in the
ESTRATO system (which include A-cc:HaL and m-
cool.) into a single incremental lexical acquisition
and maintenance program with a user-friendly in-
terface for both experts and non-experts. The in-
terface will prompt the non-expert for information
about a word without the user needing to know lin-
guistics. For example, determining the countablilty
of a noun can be done by prompting the user with
examples of the word being used in a countable con-
text and non-countable context. This will allow
non-experts to add most of the lexical and seman-
tic knowledge. Currently the process of adding or
modifying database entries and running A-COOL and
M-COOL requires the user to understand both the in-
ternal representation of the lexical items and how
to run the various programs. An interactive know-
ledge editor which hides all of the details from the
user will make the user&apos;s work much more productive
and simple.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969082793103448">
Our idea of developing a program to help automate
the task of lexical and semantic knowledge acquisi-
tion and maintenance has been very fruitful for us.
We have realized the following benefits:
• A-COOL and M-COOL make knowledge acquisi-
tion and maintenance easier, faster and more
robust. By automatically generating template
lexical and semantic database entries from the
lexical feature files, A-COOL accelerates the ac-
quisition process and eliminates many sources of
human error. Similarly, M-COOL eliminates the
need to manually update a large number of run-
time knowledge sources each time a new lexical
entry is added. By using a powerful and efficient
frame-matching rule-based system to automat-
ically generate the correct run-time knowledge
sources, knowledge-maintenance is faster.
• NI-ormL allows us to integrate generation and
analysis lexical knowledge. Because M-COOL
can generate both analysis and generation lex-
ical knowledge sources from the same central
database, this makes it very easy to create Span-
ish generation and English analysis knowledge
sources. This solves the problem of having to
maintain separate versions of knowledge for the
analysis and generation of the same language.
• It is easy to extend M-COOL to new modules.
Although we didn&apos;t anticipate it, we were able
to use M-COOL to generate and maintain a wide

variety of additional knowledge sources (for ex-
ample, a custom glossary and a phrasal-lexicon
file). m-cooL&apos;s design makes this easy.
Given the complexity and size of our machine-
translation system, COOL has become an indispensi-
ble part of our knowledge acquisition environment.

This information is often used in different ways and usually formatted for a specific NLP system. This tends to make both the acquisition and maintenance of lexical databases cumbersome, inefficient and error-prone. In order to solve these problems, we have developed program called automates the acquisition and maintenance processes and allows us to standardize and centralize the databases.
