1 INTRODUCTION

The phenomena of tense and aspect have long been of
interest to linguists and philosophers. Linguists have
tried to describe their interesting morphological, syn-
tactic, and semantic properties in the various languages
of the world, while philosophers have tried to charac-
terize formally their truth conditions. (For some recent
collections of papers, the reader is referred to Tedeschi
and Zaenen 1981; Hopper 1982; Dahl 1985; and LoCas-
io and Vet 1985.) Recently, computational linguists
have joined in the act, their interest being sparked by a
desire to characterize—at the level of processing—how
we understand and describe complex events in a chang-
ing world. Here, two kinds of questions converge—one
concerning the problem of encoding event descriptions,
the other to do with manipulating references to events.
In approaching the first question, researchers of all
linguistic stripes (computational linguists, philosophers
of language, psycholinguists, and linguists of the &amp;quot;un-
marked case&amp;quot;) have begun to turn their attention from
how languages convey information about individuals (or
sets of individuals) and their properties to how they
convey information about events and situations chang-
ing over time. In approaching the second question,
computational linguists have become interested in de-
veloping systems that can converse with users about
events and situations (e.g., for planning) or can process
accounts of events and situations (e.g., for summarizing
and/or integrating messages). Last year, following the
appearance of a number of papers on this topic at the
1987 Conference of the Association for Computational
Linguistics at Stanford, it was suggested that a special
issue of Computational Linguistics should be devoted
to the topic of tense and aspect, in order to examine
what appeared to be an emerging consensus on these
questions within the computational-linguistics commu-
nity. This issue is the result of that suggestion, and
many of the papers collected below constitute exten-
sions of the papers presented at the Stanford meeting.
The papers demonstrate both practical and theoreti-
cal advances in our understanding of tense and aspect.
With respect to those approaches that have been imple-
mented (cf. Hinrichs, Passonneau), the papers demon-
strate how far we have come in developing general
methods for extracting and representing event-related
information from text and embedding those methods in
question-answering and text-processing systems. With
respect to theoretical issues involved in how we under-
stand and describe events in a changing world (a subject
of all the papers included here), the papers demonstrate
the significance of ideas of processing, knowledge rep-
resentation, and common-sense reasoning drawn from
artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. It is
these ideas that are computation&apos;s unique contribution
to our understanding of tense and aspect, augmenting
existing contributions from linguistics and philosophy.

2 REICHENBACH&apos;S TYPOLOGY OF TENSE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998285">
Many of the papers collected here build upon Hans
Reichenbach&apos;s 1947 account of the underlying structure
of the English tense system. Reichenbach started from
the observation that the collection of English tenses1
could not be explained either (a) simply in terms of the
absolute time of an event or (b) in terms of the relative
time of that event to the (purported) time of utterance of
the tensed clause. Rather, he proposed that the inter-
pretation of tense requires three separate sense-
semantic entities: point of speech (S), point of the event
(E), and point of reference (R).2 The interpretations of S
and E are self-evident. R is the time &amp;quot;talked about&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;focused upon&amp;quot; (or, equivalently, the &amp;quot;temporal per-
spective&amp;quot; from which the described event is viewed). It
may be the same as S, as in present perfect (Example
la) or simple present tense (Example lb).

others. While all the authors in this volume have taken.

Bonnie Webber Foreword
Reichenbach&apos;s account as their starting point, they
differ in what they attempt to flesh out, pin down, or
correct, and in the details of how they do so. Neverthe-
less, there is a remarkable degree of agreement across
these accounts. If together they do not yet provide a
complete solution to the problem of how we understand
and describe events, they may still comprise a new
stage from which further progress may be made.

3 OVERVIEW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990548780488">
There are five papers included in this issue: by Erhard
Hinrichs (now at the University of Illinois), by Marc
Moens and Mark Steedman (University of Edinburgh),
by Sasha Nakhimovsky (Colgate University), by Becky
Passoneau (UNISYS) and by myself (University of
Pennsylvania). All the papers have gone through exten-
sive revision in response to internal exchange among the
authors, in addition to the usual process of external review.
Hinrichs describes a meaning-representation lan-
guage (MRL) for temporal expressions based on higher-
order Intensional Logic, that is being used in the
JANUS system, a natural-language understanding and
generation system under joint development at BBN
Laboratories and ISI. He shows how this MRL, which
employs temporal indices based on Reichenbach&apos;s
points of speech, event, and reference, avoids problems
that classical tense logics have with even basic temporal
adverbials like &amp;quot;yesterday&amp;quot;, with negation, with quan-
tification, and with multiple-clause sentences describing
multiple events. He also shows how this MRL permits
accurate description of discourse entities evoked by
tensed clauses, for use in resolving anaphoric noun
phrases (NPs) and other context-sensitive expressions.
Moens and Steedman propose and argue for a tripar-
tite ontology of events based more on notions of causa-
tion and consequence than on purely temporal primi-
tives. Their proposal allows a simple solution to what
has been called &amp;quot;the imperfective paradox&amp;quot;, to the
semantics of &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; clauses, and to the changing
sense of an event description as various temporal ad-
verbials are added to it. They also propose Reichen-
bachian-style analyses for the various &amp;quot;future tenses&amp;quot;
in English—those constructions used to describe events
that are expected, possible, or intended subsequent to
speech time. In that, they fill in a gap in Reichenbach&apos;s
own analysis, which considers only the simple future
tense and is equivocal even on that.
Nakhimovsky describes how our common-sense
knowledge of events manifests itself in language and
how this knowledge is used in understanding narratives.
Nakhimovsky discusses three types of common-sense
knowledge involved in how we describe events and
how, in turn, we understand event descriptions: knowl-
edge of the internal structuring of events, knowledge of
their duration and the durations of their various sub-
parts, and knowledge of how events can be viewed.
(The first and third types of knowledge link with discus-
sions in Moens and Steedman and in Passonneau.) At a
practical level, Nakhimovsky shows how such knowl-
edge could be stored in the lexicon.
Passonneau describes temporal processing in PUN-
DIT, a natural-language text understanding system de-
veloped by researchers at UNISYS. Its purview is
clauses that describe actual events such as are fre-
quently found in status reports. In particular, it ad-
dresses the problem of processing the distinctive con-
tributions of those linguistic elements used in describing
events of different types. For each clause describing an
actual event, Passonneau characterizes the temporal
structure of that event and its temporal location vis-à-
vis speech time or, when relevant, the event described
in an adjoining temporal adverbial. Like Moens and
Steedman, Passonneau employs a tripartite structure
for events in characterizing temporal structure. This
paper makes beautifully clear many of the factors
involved in correctly characterizing the internal tempo-
ral structure of events.
Finally, I focus on the discourse-related properties of
tensed clauses and show that they are very similar to
those of anaphoric definite NPs. Specifically, they
depend on our knowledge of plausible relations between
events (as anaphoric definite NPs depend on our knowl-
edge of plausible relations between entities), and they
respond in somewhat similar fashion to a listener&apos;s
perceptions of discourse structure. In demonstrating the
former dependency, I employ a tripartite event struc-
ture drawn from the work of Moens and Steedman and
from Passonneau. This paper contributes to a long-
standing discussion in linguistics as to whether tense
should be classified as an anaphor, as well as identifying
additional knowledge and mechanisms needed for proc-
essing reports and other narrative texts.

NOTES
1. Reichenbach regarded simple past, present, and future, and past,
present, and future perfect as tenses. While others have considered
the perfect and the future as belonging to the systems of aspect and
modality, rather than tense, Reichenbach&apos;s usage remains a con-
venient shorthand.
2. Reichenbach points out in a footnote that Jespersen, more than 20
years before, proposed a related three-point semantics for past
peifect and future perfect but did not extend a similar analysis to
the other English tenses.
