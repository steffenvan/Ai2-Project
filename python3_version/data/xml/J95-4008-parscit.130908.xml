This book describes the theoretical underpinnings and results of Rosetta, a machine
translation (MT) project that started at Philips Research Laboratory in the early 1980&apos;s;
the book focuses on research carried out between 1985 and 1992. While the project was
a collective enterprise among a large number of people (as the pen name indicates),
the principal authors were Lisette Appelo, Theo Janssen, Franciska de Jong, and Jan
Landsbergen. The book provides a coherent distillation of dozens of publications; in
particular, the work described therein has served as the basis of at least two doctoral
dissertations (Janssen 1986; Appelo 1993), as well as numerous technical reports, con-
ference papers, and journal articles. In addition to providing a novel framework for
examining issues in MT, the book covers several topics that are tied together within
a compositional, interlingual approach based on Montague grammar. Thus, it serves
as a valuable resource for researchers in MT and computational linguistics; with some
work, it could also serve as a course textbook.1
The main thesis of the book is that MT can be a good carrier for linguistic and
computational research; thus, the emphasis is on modeling linguistic knowledge in-
volved in the translation of natural languages (English, Dutch, and Spanish). The two
main principles threaded throughout the book are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9988515">
• Principle of Compositionality: Two expressions are each other&apos;s translation
if they are built up from parts which are each other&apos;s translation, by
means of translation-equivalent rules.
• Principle of Isomorphism: Two sentences are considered translations of each
other if they have the same semantic derivation trees (hence
corresponding syntactic derivation trees).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991688">
Within this framework there is a close relation between syntax and semantics: the
meaning of an expression is a function of the meaning of its parts, which, in turn are
defined by syntax. The translation relation corresponds to the &amp;quot;tuning&amp;quot; of grammars

that would allow the student to incrementally build a mini-translation system between two languages
using the principles of the Rosetta approach. An additional instructional tool would be the provision of
software for use in the development of such a system.

across language pairs, i.e., every lexical item and rule in the source language (SL) has
a corresponding lexical item and rule in the target language (TL). The challenge of
this book is to demonstrate that, by adhering as closely as possible to the principles of
compositionality and isomorphism, it is possible to master a wide range of linguistic
problems and to produce meaning-preserving translations.

1. Outline of the book
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919358974359">
The book is lengthy and dense with details of the approach; however, the material
is clearly presented with well-explained examples in all three languages.&apos; In addition
to the introduction (chapter 1) and conclusion (chapter 21), there are five parts to the
book, each of which will be described, in turn.
Part I (chapters 2-5): The Method. This part of the book spells out the two main
principles given above and describes the nature of the translation relation between
two languages. The notion of M(ontague)-grammars is introduced: these are grammars
consisting of powerful compositional rules (M-rules) that operate on constituent trees
(S-trees) capable of representing various kinds of ambiguities. The translation process
is described as a system of M-grammars with three basic components (morphology,
syntax, and semantics), each of which is reversible. Chapters 4 and 5 lay the foundation
for the rest of the book. The main point is that syntactic operations within the M-
grammar framework are meaning preserving; thus, the interlingua, which is simply a
semantic derivation tree (D-tree), has an isomorphic correspondence with the meaning-
preserving operations in the syntactic derivation tree. Related to this point, the authors
state that the interlingual / transfer debate is misplaced, and that it should be replaced
by the issue of semantics-based (i.e., meaning-preserving mappings) versus form-based
(i.e., structure-preserving mappings); they argue that all operations must necessarily
preserve meaning regardless of the overall translation design.
Part II (chapters 6-9): Elaboration of the Method. In this part, the translation compo-
nents are described in more detail. Rosetta includes a reversible morphology compo-
nent, a set of dictionaries and associated partial acquisition techniques, and a syntac-
tic component consisting of S-rules and M-rules (i.e., mappings from lexical trees to
S-trees and from S-trees to D-trees, respectively). Chapter 9 introduces the notion of
modular and controlled M-grammars, a key component of the solutions proposed for han-
dling complex phenomena in subsequent chapters. Up to this point, it is assumed that
the M-grammar rules apply freely and that no distinction is made between meaning-
preserving rules (i.e., rules that preserve semantic content of main predicates such
as &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;) and nonmeaningful rules (i.e., transformational rules that are semantically
content-free such as &amp;quot;do-insertion&amp;quot; in yes/no questions). This chapter describes the
negative consequences of these two assumptions and then presents an extension to
the framework that allows certain difficulties to be avoided. The extended framework
divides M-grammars into subgrammars, each corresponding to a different phrasal unit
(e.g., NP) and each associated with a pre-specified control expression that defines an
ordering of rule application.
Part III (chapters 10-11): Linguistic Aspects. This part of the book elaborates on the
description given in chapter 9. The main point is that controlled M-grammars make
it possible to find a proper balance between purely syntactic requirements and the
requirements of a compositional grammar. Chapter 10 demonstrates that the combi-

nation of meaning-preserving rules and syntactic transformations makes the relation
between form and meaning indirect. Chapter 11 shows that the use of transformational
rules (based on Chomsky 1957,1965) makes it possible to incorporate and extend anal-
yses of complex phenomena in a systematic and direct way.
Part IV (chapters 12-16): Solution to Translation Problems. This part, which arrives
a bit late on the scene, presents what could be considered the main contribution of
the Rosetta project. A wide range of translation problems, and their corresponding
solutions, are discussed in great detail. Chapters 12 and 13 present an approach to
the divergence problem that is contrasted with that of a number of MT researchers, in
particular, work on categorial, promotional, and demotional divergences (Dorr 1993),
structural mismatches (Estival, Ballim, Russell, and Warwick 1990), category changes
and head switching (Lindop and Tsujii 1991; Kaplan and Wedekind 1993), embedding
differences (Sadler and Thompson 1991; Kaplan, Netter, Wedekind, and Zaenen 1989),
and complex lexical mismatches (Thurmair 1990). Chapters 14-16 present an approach
to handling three additional classes of translation phenomena: temporal expressions,
idioms and complex predicates, and scope and negation. These are given a much more
comprehensive treatment than that of any other published work I have encountered in
the MT field. A number of issues raised in part IV of the book deserve more detailed
discussion; see section 2 below.
Part V (chapters 17-20): Formal Aspects and Implementation. The first two chapters
in this part, while justifiably necessary, are a bit tedious to read. Two different per-
spectives on the definition of M-grammar components and their relation to the Rosetta
modules are presented: a mathematical formalization and an attribute grammar view.
These chapters are somewhat incongruent with the rest of the book when one consid-
ers the broader goals established at the outset—they serve only to demonstrate that: (a)
properties such as strict isomorphism between M-grammars cannot be proved; and (b)
the surface grammar of the syntactic component can be viewed as an attribute gram-
mar, thus providing a framework for a cubic parsing algorithm. Chapter 19 presents
a more interesting perspective than that of the first two chapters; it describes an alge-
braic view, not of the Rosetta system itself, but of its main ingredient, the compositional
translation method. A formal description of the method&apos;s essential characteristics is
provided; this is used to investigate the power of the method and also to compare the
approach with that of other researchers. An interesting point that falls out of chapter
19 is that, because the transfer between the SL and TL is an isomorphism, the in-
terlingua could be viewed as a nonessential aspect of the system; this point will be
addressed further in section 2.
Some weaknesses are revealed in chapter 20 (Part V) and also in chapter 21 (the
Conclusion). A brief description of software-engineering aspects and results is pro-
vided, yet there are almost no details about the implementation, i.e., how the different
modules of Rosetta are integrated, which programming language is used, what the
extent of user interaction is, etc.&apos; The authors simply state that such design decisions
are &amp;quot;a matter of taste rather than of principle&amp;quot; (page 417). There is also no information
about execution times for the numerous complex phenomena presented in the first 19
chapters. The omission of these details makes it difficult to evaluate the system, es-
pecially since so many of Rosetta&apos;s characteristics (e.g., the isomorphism requirement)
depart radically from those of fully running and well-tested systems (e.g., the LOGOS
system (Gdaniec 1994)). Although the developers describe an experiment where the
approach is evaluated using a back-translation technique, it is not clear that this tech-

nique can be used as a valid test of the system and, in any case, the reported results
are not encouraging; these points are discussed further below.

2. Issues
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998145">
We now direct our attention toward three issues:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999608666666667">
• Status of interlinguality and adherence to the isomorphism principle.
• Handling of certain divergences within the compositional framework.
• Metrics used for evaluation of the system.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979603361111111">
As mentioned above, one could view the interlingua (i.e., the semantic derivation
tree) as a nonessential aspect of the system. In order to conform to the Principle
of Isomorphism, the Rosetta designers are forced to impose the restriction that the
semantic derivation tree contains no information corresponding to non-meaningful
rules of syntax. However, the nodes of the semantic derivation tree are not assigned
universal status; rather, these stand only as placeholders for meaning-preserving rules
in the syntax module. Thus, the same effect could be achieved by a simple transfer
mapping between analogous meaning-preserving rules in the SL and TL.
Indeed, this point has been brought up previously (Hutchins and Somers 1992,
p. 294), where the primary criticism is that the SL and TL grammars are so tightly
attuned that the approach might even be considered direct MT. Given that the trans-
lation operations in Rosetta induce complex transformations (e.g., for handling head-
swapping divergences), I do not fully agree with Hutchins and Somers&apos;s assessment;
however, I see no advantage to assuming an interlingual representation (at least one
that does not have universal status), especially given that the same set of phenomena
has been handled previously in simpler transfer designs.
Rosetta&apos;s separation of meaning-preserving and non-meaningful rules is reminis-
cent of the notion of relaxed compositionality in transfer systems such as Eurotra and
its descendant, MiMo (Arnold, Krauwer, des Tombe, and Sadler 1988; Arnold and
Sadler 1990), where &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; rules are used for compositional phenomena and &amp;quot;ex-
ceptional&amp;quot; rules are used for noncompositional phenomena. (Not surprisingly, both
groups address the same phenomena, e.g., head-swapping translations.) In fact, the
authors suggest (pages 59-60) that the input-output behaviors of both designs are en-
tirely equivalent. The only motivation for using an interlingua is that it is preferable
to have an explicit stage where the meaning of the input expression is accessible for
interactive disambiguation. This may be so, but because there is no discussion of an
interactive disambiguation component, the full benefit of this design is not entirely
obvious.
Regarding the second issue, that of handling divergences, it is clear that the Rosetta
researchers have undertaken a thorough investigation in this area. However, some of
their solutions rely heavily on the Principle of Compositionality, which, as we will see,
has its limitations.
Consider the case of categorial divergence in which two phrasal heads are swapped:
English: Mary happened to come
Dutch: Mary kwam toevallig
&apos;Mary came by chance&apos;
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999759023809524">
Invariably, interlingua designers (myself included) are forced to select a canonical form
that parallels one language or the other in the case of head-swapping phenomena.4
In the example above, the representation that is chosen corresponds logically to the
canonical form &apos;by-chance (Mary, come)&apos;. Thus, the English syntactic structure parallels
the canonical form: the verb construct corresponding to &apos;by-chance&apos; (happen to) takes as
its argument the clause corresponding to &apos; (Mary , come)&apos; (came). The Dutch syntax, on
the other hand, is not in synch with the canonical form since the verb corresponding
to &apos; (come ,Mary)&apos; (kwam) takes as its argument the adverbial construct corresponding
to &apos;by-chance&apos; (toevallig or &apos;by chance&apos;).
In order to handle such cases compositionally, the subgrammar approach (see
description in part II above) must be further revised so that, within the application
of a subgrammar (e.g., ADVP), a &amp;quot;switch rule&amp;quot; is invoked and normal processing is
interrupted; control is then passed to a different subgrammar (e.g., VP) and a new
category (derived from an argument of the canonical head) takes over the role of
syntactic head. Given that the book omits many implementational details, it is not clear
how a &amp;quot;switch rule&amp;quot; is triggered. One assumption that is consistent with the framework
described in chapter 9 is that interrupts are specified as part of the control expression
associated with each subgrammar. This leaves open the question of how grammar-
driven interrupts interact with idiosyncratic requirements of individual lexical items.
In the case above, the nonhead constituent toevallig could be viewed as a &amp;quot;deviant&amp;quot;
in that it takes on nonhead status in the syntax but head status in the canonical
form. It would make a great deal of sense to encode such information in the lexicon
(i.e., associate a lexical marker with the word itself as in Dorr (1993)). With such an
encoding, it would not be the case that every Dutch adverbial (e.g., gisteren &apos;yesterday&apos;)
triggers a grammar interrupt; only certain adverbials would act as triggers, namely
those associated with a lexical marker (e.g., toevallig).
A more troubling aspect of the &amp;quot;switch-rule&amp;quot; approach is that it is difficult, or
perhaps impossible, to accommodate head-swapping cases where the &amp;quot;deviant&amp;quot; serves
as a head in the syntax but a nonhead in the canonical form. Consider the following
example:
English: Mary usually goes to school
Spanish: Mary suele ir a la escuela
&apos;Mary is accustomed to go to school&apos;
In this example, the canonical form could, arguably, be &apos;go (Mary, school , usually )&apos;.5
In this case, the English syntax parallels the canonical form. By contrast, the Spanish
syntax includes the &amp;quot;deviant&amp;quot; verb suele, which is a head in the syntax but a nonhead
in the canonical form; this is the inverse of the previous example. The head-swapping
cases on pages 249-250 of the book do not include such a case, perhaps because this
would force an interrupt to occur too late after the syntactic structure corresponding
to the logical head has already been built within a VP subgrammar. It seems that
the choice of canonical form is rigid in that a potential &amp;quot;deviant&amp;quot; (such as suele in
the current example and toevallig in the previous example) must always be associated
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.853260833333333">
4 My preference would be to argue for the choice of interlingua on linguistic grounds (e.g., tests that
predict lexical-semantic behavior such as those in Levin (1993), especially in a project like Rosetta,
where the developers claim to be modeling linguistic knowledge. However, choosing an interlingua is
undeniably a slippery endeavor (see, for example, Dorr and Voss (1993)) and so I am more than willing
to leave this issue aside for the purposes of this review.
5 See Dorr (1993) for linguistic justification of this representation.

with the head in the canonical representation.&apos; Thus, even though it might not be
linguistically justified, the canonical representation for the Spanish sentence would
be &apos;be- ac cust omed (Mary ,go ( scho o ) )&apos;. By contrast, the English sentence would map
into the canonical form given above, which means that the two would never be transla-
tion equivalents. Instead the system would force the following, more literal, translation
pairs (in both directions):
English: Mary usually goes to school
Spanish: Mary usualmente va a la escuela
English: Mary is accustomed to going to school
Spanish: Mary suele ir a la escuela
The above difficulties are symptomatic of a more far-reaching problem—lexical-
semantic information is ignored in the compositional derivation of the interlingua.
Taking a grammar-driven approach forces the Rosetta developers to regard cases of
lexical-semantic mismatch as purely grammatical. For example, in chapter 12, the au-
thors view conflation as a simple one-to-many correspondence (e.g., the relation be-
tween the English word love and the equivalent multi-word phrase amar a in Span-
ish). This is not at all the conventional view as presented by Talmy (1983, 1985), where
conflation is considered to be a much more complex notion, i.e., a meaningful word
in one language (e.g., the English verb float) is composed of semantic units that corre-
spond to more than one meaningful word in the other language (e.g., mudaba flotando
or &apos;move floating&apos;). This version of conflation is not adequately addressed in the book,
most likely because the compositional framework does not extend to the lexical level.
In fact, it is not clear whether such an extension would be possible in the context of
the isomorphism restriction, which impedes the mapping of a single meaningful con-
stituent in one language to more than one meaningful constituent in another language.
The only way to finesse this would be to render one constituent &amp;quot;meaningless.&amp;quot; But
then which one would we pick? Suppose, for example, that we pick mudaba to be the
meaningless constituent in the phrase mudaba flotando—then how would we prevent
the verb mudar from being ignored in contexts where it stands alone, as in John se muclo
a las afueras de Boston (or &apos;John moved outside of Boston&apos;)? The possibility of extending
the notion of compositionality into the lexicon is an issue that should be discussed in
a book on a compositional MT system, especially given the wealth of literature in this
area (see, for example, Levin (1993; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995)).
Finally, we turn to the issue of the metrics used for evaluation of the Rosetta
system. The authors report on an experiment in which 1246 Dutch sentences are first
translated into English and then back into Dutch; the Dutch input and output are
then compared, with a result of 57% correctness. The reliability of the back-translation
technique is questionable, at best. Given that the development of evaluation metrics
for MT has been an area of serious debate for at least three decades, it is surprising
that the Rosetta researchers so readily accept this as a true test of the system.&apos;
The reason I am skeptical about this technique is that it provides very little insight
into the quality of the translation system. If the Dutch input and output are the same,
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.985755166666667">
6 On page 249, the authors mention that the label &amp;quot;categorial divergence&amp;quot; covers both the promotional
and demotional cases in Dorr (1993); no explanation is given for this move, but I would suspect it is
because of this rigidity.
7 See, for example, the 1993 special issue of Machine Translation on evaluation of MT systems; in
particular, the article by Arnold, Sadler, and Humphreys (1993) provides a thorough overview of
evaluation techniques, none of which includes back-translation.

we know nothing about the quality of the intervening English sentence. We simply
know that the system has faithfully maintained the isomorphism requirement. If the
Dutch input and output are different, we still know nothing about the quality of the
intervening English sentence because the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; translation of that sentence is not
necessarily the Dutch original. There might even be cases where the back-translated
sentence is an improvement on the original input. To illustrate this point consider the
following case where an English sentence is back-translated via Spanish:
English: Mary is accustomed to going to school
Spanish: Mary suele ir a la escuela
English: Mary usually goes to school
Here the English input does not match the final English output, yet the translation is
clearly valid at each step.
Because of the isomorphism restriction in Rosetta, it is doubtful that the low rate
of 57% can be attributed to cases that parallel the example given here. In fact, it
is surprising that Rosetta does so poorly despite the isomorphism requirement. One
would expect results to be spuriously high given that there are surely cases where the
Dutch input and output match each other, yet the intervening English sentence—albeit
structurally isomorphic to the Dutch—is not an appropriate translation. Other than a
brief mention of certain phenomena that were not yet handled (e.g., coordination), the
authors do not speculate as to why the result rate is so low or, even worse, whether
this rate is accidentally high due to the isomorphism requirement.

3. Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999850333333333">
The book is of great interest to the computational linguistics and machine translation
communities and could, perhaps, serve as a textbook for instructors in these areas.
Its weaknesses are that it omits discussion of the role of the lexicon in the handling
of certain divergence types and that it fails to provide a thorough evaluation of the
techniques that are proposed. Even so, the authors have written clearly about some
of the hardest phenomena in MT and have remained consistent in their handling
of these phenomena under strict assumptions of compositionality and isomorphism;
their treatment is more in-depth and broad-scope than any other MT book I have
encountered.

<abstract confidence="0.979149358974359">This book describes the theoretical underpinnings and results of Rosetta, a machine translation (MT) project that started at Philips Research Laboratory in the early 1980&apos;s; the book focuses on research carried out between 1985 and 1992. While the project was a collective enterprise among a large number of people (as the pen name indicates), the principal authors were Lisette Appelo, Theo Janssen, Franciska de Jong, and Jan Landsbergen. The book provides a coherent distillation of dozens of publications; in particular, the work described therein has served as the basis of at least two doctoral dissertations (Janssen 1986; Appelo 1993), as well as numerous technical reports, conference papers, and journal articles. In addition to providing a novel framework for examining issues in MT, the book covers several topics that are tied together within a compositional, interlingual approach based on Montague grammar. Thus, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers in MT and computational linguistics; with some it could also serve as a course The main thesis of the book is that MT can be a good carrier for linguistic and computational research; thus, the emphasis is on modeling linguistic knowledge involved in the translation of natural languages (English, Dutch, and Spanish). The two main principles threaded throughout the book are: Principle of Compositionality: expressions are each other&apos;s translation if they are built up from parts which are each other&apos;s translation, by means of translation-equivalent rules. Principle of Isomorphism: sentences are considered translations of each other if they have the same semantic derivation trees (hence corresponding syntactic derivation trees). Within this framework there is a close relation between syntax and semantics: the meaning of an expression is a function of the meaning of its parts, which, in turn are defined by syntax. The translation relation corresponds to the &amp;quot;tuning&amp;quot; of grammars 1 For example, it might be possible to include some programming problems at the end of each chapter that would allow the student to incrementally build a mini-translation system between two languages using the principles of the Rosetta approach. An additional instructional tool would be the provision of software for use in the development of such a system. 582 Book Reviews across language pairs, i.e., every lexical item and rule in the source language (SL) has a corresponding lexical item and rule in the target language (TL). The challenge of this book is to demonstrate that, by adhering as closely as possible to the principles of compositionality and isomorphism, it is possible to master a wide range of linguistic problems and to produce meaning-preserving translations. 1.

Rosetta&apos;s separation of meaning-preserving and non-meaningful rules is reminiscent of the notion of relaxed compositionality in transfer systems such as Eurotra and its descendant, MiMo (Arnold, Krauwer, des Tombe, and Sadler 1988; Arnold and Sadler 1990), where &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; rules are used for compositional phenomena and &amp;quot;exceptional&amp;quot; rules are used for noncompositional phenomena. (Not surprisingly, both groups address the same phenomena, e.g., head-swapping translations.) In fact, the authors suggest (pages 59-60) that the input-output behaviors of both designs are entirely equivalent. The only motivation for using an interlingua is that it is preferable to have an explicit stage where the meaning of the input expression is accessible for interactive disambiguation.

This leaves open the question of how grammardriven interrupts interact with idiosyncratic requirements of individual lexical items. In the case above, the nonhead constituent toevallig could be viewed as a &amp;quot;deviant&amp;quot; in that it takes on nonhead status in the syntax but head status in the canonical form. It would make a great deal of sense to encode such information in the lexicon (i.e., associate a lexical marker with the word itself as in Dorr (1993)). With such an encoding, it would not be the case that every Dutch adverbial (e.g., gisteren &apos;yesterday&apos;) triggers a grammar interrupt; only certain adverbials would act as triggers, namely those associated with a lexical marker (e.g., toevallig). A more troubling aspect of the &amp;quot;switch-rule&amp;quot; approach is that it is difficult, or perhaps impossible, to accommodate head-swapping cases where the &amp;quot;deviant&amp;quot; serves as a head in the syntax but a nonhead in the canonical form.

However, choosing an interlingua is undeniably a slippery endeavor (see, for example, Dorr and Voss (1993)) and so I am more than willing to leave this issue aside for the purposes of this review. 5 See Dorr (1993) for linguistic justification of this representation. 586 Book Reviews with the head in the canonical representation.&apos; Thus, even though it might not be linguistically justified, the canonical representation for the Spanish sentence would be &apos;be- ac cust omed (Mary ,go ( scho o ) )&apos;.

Given that the development of evaluation metrics for MT has been an area of serious debate for at least three decades, it is surprising that the Rosetta researchers so readily accept this as a true test of the system.&apos; The reason I am skeptical about this technique is that it provides very little insight into the quality of the translation system. If the Dutch input and output are the same, 6 On page 249, the authors mention that the label &amp;quot;categorial divergence&amp;quot; covers both the promotional and demotional cases in Dorr (1993); no explanation is given for this move, but I would suspect it is because of this rigidity. 7 See, for example, the 1993 special issue of Machine Translation on evaluation of MT systems; in particular, the article by Arnold, Sadler, and Humphreys (1993) provides a thorough overview of evaluation techniques, none of which includes back-translation. 587 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 we know nothing about the quality of the intervening English sentence.

However, choosing an interlingua is undeniably a slippery endeavor (see, for example, Dorr and Voss (1993)) and so I am more than willing to leave this issue aside for the purposes of this review. 5 See Dorr (1993) for linguistic justification of this representation. 586 Book Reviews with the head in the canonical representation.&apos; Thus, even though it might not be linguistically justified, the canonical representation for the Spanish sentence would be &apos;be- ac cust omed (Mary ,go ( scho o ) )</context>
<context position="20097" citStr="Levin (1993" startWordPosition="3131" endWordPosition="3132"> this would be to render one constituent &amp;quot;meaningless.&amp;quot; But then which one would we pick? Suppose, for example, that we pick mudaba to be the meaningless constituent in the phrase mudaba flotando—then how would we prevent the verb mudar from being ignored in contexts where it stands alone, as in John se muclo a las afueras de Boston (or &apos;John moved outside of Boston&apos;)? The possibility of extending the notion of compositionality into the lexicon is an issue that should be discussed in a book on a compositional MT system, especially given the wealth of literature in this area (see, for example, Levin (1993; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995)). Finally, we turn to the issue of the metrics used for evaluation of the Rosetta system. The authors report on an experiment in which 1246 Dutch sentences are first translated into English and then back into Dutch; the Dutch input and output are then compared, with a result of 57% correctness. The reliability of the back-translation technique is questionable, at best. Given that the development of evaluation metrics for MT has been an area of serious debate for at least three decades, it is surprising that the Rosetta researchers so readily accept this as a t</context>

This part, which arrives a bit late on the scene, presents what could be considered the main contribution of the Rosetta project. A wide range of translation problems, and their corresponding solutions, are discussed in great detail. Chapters 12 and 13 present an approach to the divergence problem that is contrasted with that of a number of MT researchers, in particular, work on categorial, promotional, and demotional divergences (Dorr 1993), structural mismatches (Estival, Ballim, Russell, and Warwick 1990), category changes and head switching (Lindop and Tsujii 1991; Kaplan and Wedekind 1993), embedding differences (Sadler and Thompson 1991; Kaplan, Netter, Wedekind, and Zaenen 1989), and complex lexical mismatches (Thurmair 1990). Chapters 14-16 present an approach to handling three additional classes of translation phenomena: temporal expressions, idioms and complex predicates, and scope and negation. These are given a much more comprehensive treatment than that of any other published work I have encountered in the MT field.

Taking a grammar-driven approach forces the Rosetta developers to regard cases of lexical-semantic mismatch as purely grammatical. For example, in chapter 12, the authors view conflation as a simple one-to-many correspondence (e.g., the relation between the English word love and the equivalent multi-word phrase amar a in Spanish). This is not at all the conventional view as presented by Talmy (1983, 1985), where conflation is considered to be a much more complex notion, i.e., a meaningful word in one language (e.g., the English verb float) is composed of semantic units that correspond to more than one meaningful word in the other language (e.g., mudaba flotando or &apos;move floating&apos;). This version of conflation is not adequately addressed in the book, most likely because the compositional framework does not extend to the lexical level. In fact, it is not clear whether such an extension would be possible in the context of the isomorphism restriction, which impedes the mapping of a single me</context>
