ARBITER is a Prolog program that extracts
assertions about macromolecular binding
relationships from biomedical text. We de-
scribe the domain knowledge and the under-
specified linguistic analyses that support the
identification of these predications. After
discussing a formal evaluation of
ARBITER, we report on its application to
491,000 MEDLINE® abstracts, during
which almost 25,000 binding relationships
suitable for entry into a database of macro-
molecular function were extracted.

Far more scientific information exists in the lit-
erature than in any structured database. Con-
venient access to this information could signifi-
cantly benefit research activities in various
fields. The emerging technology of information
extraction (Appelt and Israel 1997, Hearst 1999)
provides a means of gaining access to this in-
formation. In this paper we report on a project to
extract biomolecular data from biomedical text.
We concentrate on molecular binding affinity,
which provides a strong indication of macro-
molecular function and is a core phenomenon in
molecular biology. Our ultimate goal is to auto-
matically construct a database of binding rela-
tionships asserted in MEDLINE citations.
The National Library of Medicine&apos;s
MEDLINE textual database is an online reposi-
tory of more than 10 million citations from the
biomedical literature. All citations contain the
title of the corresponding article along with other
bibliographic information. In addition, a large
number of citations contain author-supplied ab-
stracts. Initial studies indicate that there are ap-
proximately 500,000 MEDLINE citations rele-
vant to molecular binding affinity.
Our decision to apply information extraction
technology to binding relationships was guided
not only by the biological importance of this
phenomenon but also by the relatively straight-
forward syntactic cuing of binding predications
in text The inflectional forms of a single verb,
bind, indicate this relationship in the vast major-
ity of cases, and our initial work is limited to
these instances. For example, our goal in this
project is to extract the binding predications in
(2) from the text in (1).

Considerable interest in information extrac-
tion has concentrated on identifying named enti-
ties in text pertaining to current events (for ex-
ample, Wacholder et al. 1997, Voorhees and
Harman 1998, and MUC-7); however, several
recent efforts have been directed at biomolecular
data (Blaschke et al. 1999, Craven and Kumlien
1999, and Rindflesch et al. 2000, for example).
The overall goal is to transform the information

encoded in text into a more readily accessible
format, typically a template with slots named for
the participants in the scenario of interest. The
template for molecular binding can be thought of
as a simple predication with predicate &amp;quot;bind&amp;quot;
and two arguments which participate (sym-
metrically) in the relationship: BINDS(&lt;X&gt;,
&lt;Y&gt;).
Various strategies, both linguistic and statis-
tical, have been used in information extraction
efforts. We introduce a Prolog program called
ARBITER (Assess and Retrieve Binding Termi-
nology) that takes advantage of an existing do-
main knowledge source and relies on syntactic
cues provided by a partial parser in order to
identify and extract binding relations from text.
We discuss the syntactic processing used and
then report on a formal evaluation of ARBITER
against a test collection of 116 MEDLINE cita-
tions in which the binding relations were marked
by hand. Finally, we provide a brief overview of
the results of applying ARBITER to the 500,000
MEDLINE citations discussing molecular bind-
ing affinity.

1 Extracting Binding Relationships
from Text
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969151515151">
Our strategy for extracting binding relationships
from text divides the task into two phases: Dur-
ing the first phase we identify all potential
binding arguments, and then in the second phase
we extract just those binding terms which are as-
serted in the text as participating in a particular
binding predication. In support of this proces-
sing, we rely on the linguistic and domain
knowledge contained in the National Library of
Medicine&apos;s Unified Medical Language System®
(UMLS®) as well an existing tool, the
SPECIALIST minimal commitment parser (Ar-
onson et al. 1994).
The UMLS (Humphreys et al. 1998) consists
of several knowledge sources applicable in the
biomedical domain: the Metathesaurus, Seman-
tic Network, and SPECIALIST Lexicon
(McCray et al. 1994). The Metathesaurus was
constructed from more than forty controlled vo-
cabularies and contains more than 620,000 bio-
medical concepts. The characteristic of the
Metathesaurus most relevant for this project is
that each concept is associated with a semantic
type that categorizes the concept into subareas of
biology or medicine. Examples pertinent to
binding terminology include the semantic types
&apos;Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein&apos; and &apos;Nucleo-
tide Sequence&apos;. The SPECIALIST Lexicon
(with associated lexical access tools) supplies
syntactic information for a large compilation of
biomedical and general English terms.
The SPECIALIST minimal commitment
parser relies on the SPECIALIST Lexicon as
well as the Xerox stochastic tagger (Cutting et
al. 1992). The output produced is in the tradition
of partial parsing (Hindle 1983, McDonald
1992, Weischedel et al. 1993) and concentrates
on the simple noun phrase, what Weischedel et
al. (1993) call the &amp;quot;core noun phrase,&amp;quot; that is a
noun phrase with no modification to the right of
the head. Several approaches provide similar
output based on statistics (Church 1988, Zhai
1997, for example), a finite-state machine (Ait-
Mokhtar and Chanod 1997), or a hybrid ap-
proach combining statistics and linguistic rules
(Voutilainen and Padro 1997).
The SPECIALIST parser is based on the no-
tion of barrier words (Tersmette et al. 1988),
which indicate boundaries between phrases. Af-
ter lexical look-up and resolution of category la-
bel ambiguity by the Xerox tagger, complemen-
tizers, conjunctions, modals, prepositions, and
verbs are marked as boundaries. Subsequently,
boundaries are considered to open a new phrase
(and close the preceding phrase). Any phrase
containing a noun is considered to be a (simple)
noun phrase, and in such a phrase, the right-most
noun is labeled as the head, and all other items
(other than determiners) are labeled as modifi-
ers. An example of the output from the
SPECIALIST parser is given below in (4). The
partial parse produced serves as the basis for the
first phase of extraction of binding relationships,
namely the identification of those simple noun
phrases acting as potential binding arguments
(referred to as &amp;quot;binding terms&amp;quot;).

1.1 Identifying binding terminology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999483">
In order to identify binding terminology in text
we rely on the approach discussed in (Rindflesch
et al. 1999). Text with locally-defined acronyms
expanded is submitted to the Xerox tagger and
the SPECIALIST parser. Subsequent processing
concentrates on the heads of simple noun

phrases and proceeds in a series of cascaded
steps that depend on existing domain knowledge
as well as several small, special-purpose re-
sources in order to determine whether each noun
phrase encountered is to be considered a binding
term.
As the first step in the process, an existing
program, MetaMap, (Aronson et al. 1994) at-
tempts to map each simple noun phrase to a con-
cept in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The semantic
type for concepts corresponding to successfully
mapped noun phrases is then checked against a
small subset of UMLS semantic types referring
to bindable entities, such as &apos;Amino Acid, Pep-
tide, or Protein&apos;, &apos;Nucleotide Sequence&apos;, &apos;Car-
bohydrate&apos;, &apos;Cell&apos;, and &apos;Virus&apos;. For concepts
with a semantic type in this set, the correspond-
ing noun phrase is considered to be a binding
term.
The heads of noun phrases that do not map to
a concept in the Metathesaurus are tested against
a small set of general &amp;quot;binding words,&amp;quot; which
often indicate that the noun phrase in which they
appear is a binding term. The set of binding
words includes such nouns as cleft, groove,
membrane, ligand, motif, receptor, domain, ele-
ment, and molecule.
The head of a noun phrase that did not sub-
mit to the preceding steps is examined to see
whether it adheres to the morphologic shape of a
normal English word. In this context such a
word is often an acronym not defined locally
and indicates the presence of a binding term
(Fukuda et al. 1998). A normal English word has
at least one vowel and no digits, and a text token
that contains at least one letter and is not a nor-
mal English word functions as a binding word in
this context.
The final step in identifying binding terms is
to join contiguous simple noun phrases qualify-
ing as binding terms into a single macro-noun
phrase. Rindflesch et al. (1999) use the term
&amp;quot;macro-noun phrase&amp;quot; to refer to structures that
include reduced relative clauses (commonly in-
troduced by prepositions or participles) as well
as appositives. Two binding terms joined by a
form of be are also treated as though they
formed a macro-noun phrase, as in Je142 is an
IgG which binds ...
The results of identifying binding terms (and
thus potential binding arguments) are given in
(4) for the sentence in (3). In (4) evidence sup-
porting identification as a binding term is given
in braces. Note that in the underspecified syn-
tactic analysis, prepositional phrases are treated
as (simple) noun phrases that have a preposition
as their first member.

1.2 Identifying binding terms as

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999855">
Before addressing the strategy for determining
the arguments of binding predications, we dis-
cuss the general treatment of macro-noun
phrases during the second part of the processing.
Although ARBITER attempts to recover com-
plete macro-noun phrases during the first phase,
only the most specific (and biologically useful)
part of a macro-noun phrase is recovered during
the extraction of binding predications. Terms re-
ferring to specific molecules are more useful
than those referring to general classes of bind-
able entities, such as receptor, ligand, protein,
or molecule. The syntactic head of a macro-noun
phrase (the first simple noun phrase in the list) is
not always the most specific or most useful term
in the construction.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.983734">

<bodyText confidence="0.995571720930233">
The Specificity Rule for determining the
most specific part of the list of simple binding
terms constituting a macro-noun phrase chooses
the first simple term in the list which has either
of the following two characteristics: a) The head
was identified by the Morphology Shape Rule.
b) The noun phrase maps to a UMLS concept
having one of the following semantic types:
&apos;Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein&apos;, &apos;Nucleic
Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide&apos;, &apos;Nucleotide
Sequence&apos;, &apos;Immunologic Factor&apos;, or &apos;Gene or
Genome&apos;. For example, in (5), the second simple
term, TNF-alpha promoter, maps to the Meta-
thesaurus with semantic type &apos;Nucleotide Se-
quence&apos; and is thus considered to be the most
specific term in this complex-noun phrase.
(5) binding_term(
[transcriptionally active kappaB motifs],
[in the TNF-alpha promoter],
[in normal cells])
In identifying binding terms as arguments of
a complete binding predication, as indicated
above, we examine only those binding relations
cued by some form of the verb bind (bind, binds,
bound, and binding). The list of minimal syntac-
tic phrases constituting the partial parse of the
input sentence is examined from left to right; for
each occurrence of a form of binds, the two
binding terms serving as arguments are then
sought. (During the tagging process, we force
bind, binds, and bound to be labeled as &amp;quot;verb,&amp;quot;
and binding as &amp;quot;noun.&amp;quot;)
A partial analysis of negation and coor-
dination is undertaken by ARBITER, but ana-
phora resolution and a syntactic treatment of re-
lativization are not attempted. With the added
constraint that a binding argument must have
been identified as a binding term based on the
domain knowledge resources used, the partial
syntactic analysis available to ARBITER sup-
ports the accurate identification of a large num-
ber of binding predications asserted in the re-
search literature.

1.2.1 Arguments of binding
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945490384615385">
It is convenient to categorize binding pred-
ications into two classes depending on which
form of bind cues the predication: a) binding and
b) bind, binds, and bound. In our test collection
(discussed below), about half of the binding re-
lationships asserted in the text are cued by the
gerundive or participial form binding. In this
syntactic predication, the resources available
from the underspecified syntactic parse serve
quite well as the basis for correctly identifying
the arguments of the binding relationship.
The most common argument configuration
associated with binding is for both arguments to
occur to the right, cued by prepositions, most
commonly of and to; however, other frequent
patterns are of-by and to-by. Another method of
argument cuing for binding is for the subject of
the predication to function syntactically as a
modifier of the head binding in the same simple
noun phrase. The object in this instance is then
cued by either of or to (to the right). A few other
patterns are seen and some occurrences of bind-
ing do not cue a complete predication; either the
subject is missing or neither argument is expli-
citly mentioned. However, the examples in (6)
fairly represent the interpretation of binding.

Thr-340 and Ser-343, play important but

<bodyText confidence="0.999709454545454">
The arguments of forms of bind other than
binding invariably occur on either side of the
cuing verb form. The default strategy for iden-
tifying both arguments in these instances is to
choose the closest binding term on either side of
the verb. In the cases we have investigated, this
strategy works often enough to be useful for the
surface object. However, due to predicate coor-
dination as well as relativization, such a strategy
often fails to identify correctly the surface sub-
ject of bind (binds or bound) when more than

one binding term precedes the verb. We there-
fore use the strategy summarized in (7) for re-
covering the surface subject in such instances.
(7) When more than one binding term precedes a
form of bind other than binding, choose the
most specific of these binding terms as the
surface subject of the predication.
&amp;quot;Most specific&amp;quot; is determined (recursively) for a
series of binding terms in the same way that the
most specific part of a complex binding term is
determined.
The input text (8) provides an example of a
binding predication cued by binds in which the
arguments appear (immediately) on either side
of the cuing verb. The two macro-noun phrases
serving as potential arguments are underlined.

TGTCTC has a head that submits to the Mor-
phology Shape Rule and hence is considered to
be more specific than auxin response elements.

to select the surface subject of the binding pred-

Both Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein and a

and have been identified as binding terms by the
first phase of processing. However, Phos-
phatidylinositol transfer protein maps to the cor-
responding Metathesaurus concept with seman-
tic type &apos;Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein, thus
causing it to be more specific than a single lipid-
binding site. The second predication listed in
(10) was correctly extracted due to coordination
processing.
ARBIThR pursues limited coordination
identification in the spirit of Agarwal and Bog-
gess (1992) and Rindflesch (1995). Only bind-
ing terms are considered as candidates for coor-
dination. For each conjunction encountered, the
phrase immediately to the right is examined; if it
is a binding term, all contiguous binding terms
occurring immediately to the left of the conjunct
are considered to be coordinate with the right
conjunct. Coordination inside the simple noun
phrase is not considered, and therefore structures
such as The TCR alpha beta or -gamma delta
chains are not recognized. Nonetheless, as in-
dicated in (11), this limited approach to noun
phrase coordination is often effective.

Although the particular underspecified syn-

binding predications in the biomedical research
literature is limited in several important ways, it

2 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998246181818182">
In order to determine ARBITER&apos;s effectiveness,
the program was formally evaluated against a
gold standard of MEDLINE citations in which
the binding predications asserted were marked
by hand. A search of MEDLINE limited to one
month (June 1997) and based on the text words
((bind, binds, binding, or bound) and (protein or
proteins)) retrieved 116 citations with 1,141 sen-
tences; of these, 346 contained some form of the
verb bind. 260 binding predications were identi-
fied in the binding sentences. (The binding sen-
tences also contained 2,025 simple noun
phrases, 1,179 of which were marked as being
binding terms.)
In processing this test collection, ARBITER
extracted 181 binding predications, 132 of which
were correct. Since ARBITER missed 128
marked binding predications (false negatives)
and incorrectly identified 49 such relationships,
recall and precision as measures of effectiveness
are 51% and 73%, respectively.
In comparing ARBITER&apos;s output against that
marked in the gold standard, fairly stringent
matching criteria were used. A binding predica-
tion extracted from a particular sentence by
ARBITER had to appear in that same sentence
in the gold standard (not just the same citation)
in order to be counted as correct. Further, in the
gold standard, only the most specific component
of a macro-noun phrase was marked as being the
correct argument for a particular binding predi-
cation. If ARBITER retrieved any other part of a
macro-noun phrase in identifying the arguments
of that predication, it was assessed as an error.
A large number of ARBITER errors are due
to two phenomena: difficulties in correctly iden-
tifying binding terms during the first phase of
processing and syntactic complexity confound-
ing argument identification during the second
phase. An example of the first error type is seen
in (12), where the failure to identify ran as a
binding term caused ARBITER to miss the cor-
rect binding predication asserted in this sentence
(indicated by &amp;quot;-FN-&gt;&amp;quot;).

This error then led to the false positive error
(&amp;quot;-FP-&gt;&amp;quot;) when the program wrongly interpreted
the next noun phrase in the sentence (signal-
mediated nuclear protein export) as the second
argument in this predication.
The interaction of coordination and negation
in (13) caused ARBITER to partially misinter-
pret the binding predications in this sentence.

As an initial application of ARBITER we ran the
program on 491,356 MEDLINE citations, which
were retrieved using the same search strategy re-
sponsible for the gold standard. During this run,
331,777 sentences in 192,997 citations produced
419,782 total binding assertions. Extrapolating
from the gold standard evaluation, we assume
that this is about half of the total binding predi-
cations asserted in the citations processed and
that somewhat less than three quarters of those
extracted are correct.
The initial list of 419,982 binding triples rep-
resents what ARBITER determined was asserted
in the text being processed. Many of these as-
sertions, such as those in (14), while correct, are
too general to be useful.

Further processing on ARBITER raw output
extracted specific protein names and genomic
structures and reduced the number of such
binding predications to 345,706. From these
more specific binding predication, we began the
construction of a database containing binding
relations asserted in the literature. More detailed
discussion of this database can be found in (Ra-
jan et al. in prep); however, here we give an ini-
tial description of its characteristics.
We submitted the 345,706 more specific
ARBITER binding predications to a search in
GenBank (Benson et al. 1998) and determined
that 106,193 referred to a GenBank entry. The
number of Genbank entries with at least one
binding assertion is 11,617. Preliminary results
indicate that the database we are constructing
will have some of the following characteristics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986573125">
• 10,769 bindings between two distinct Gen-
bank entries (5,569 unique)
• 875 more binding assertions found between
an entry and a specific DNA sequence
• 27,345 bindings between a Genbank entry
and a UMLS Metathesaurus concept
• 5,569 unique relationships among pairs of
entries (involving 11,617 unique entries)

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999207">
The cooperation of structured domain knowl-
edge and underspecified syntactic analysis en-
ables the extraction of macromolecular binding
relationships from the research literature. Al-
though our implementation is domain-specific,
the underlying principles are amenable to
broader applicability.
ARBITER makes a distinction between first
labeling binding terms and then identifying cer-
tain of these terms as arguments in a binding
predication. The first phase of this processing is
dependent on biomedical domain knowledge ac-
cessible from the UMLS. Applying the tech-
niques we propose in other areas would require
at least a minimum of semantic classification of
the concepts involved. General, automated tech-
niques that could supply this requirement are be-
coming increasingly available (Morin and Jac-
quemin 1999, for example).
Although we concentrated on the inflectional
forms of a single verb, the principles we invoke
to support argument identification during the
second phase of processing apply generally to
English predication encoding strategies (with a
minimum of effort necessary to address preposi-
tional cuing of gerundive arguments for specific
verbs). The approach to noun phrase coordina-
tion also applies generally, so long as hy-
pernymic classification is available for the heads
of the potential conjuncts.

Introduction Far more scientific information exists in the literature than in any structured database. Convenient access to this information could significantly benefit research activities in various fields. The emerging technology of information extraction (Appelt and Israel 1997, Hearst 1999) provides a means of gaining access to this information. In this paper we report on a project to extract biomolecular data from biomedical text. We concentrate on molecular binding affinity, which provides a strong indication of macromolecular function and is a core phenomenon in molecular biology. Our ultimate goal is to automatically construct a database of binding relationships asserted in MEDLINE citations.

In support of this processing, we rely on the linguistic and domain knowledge contained in the National Library of Medicine&apos;s Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS®) as well an existing tool, the SPECIALIST minimal commitment parser (Aronson et al. 1994). The UMLS (Humphreys et al. 1998) consists of several knowledge sources applicable in the biomedical domain: the Metathesaurus, Semantic Network, and SPECIALIST Lexicon (McCray et al. 1994). The Metathesaurus was constructed from more than forty controlled vocabularies and contains more than 620,000 biomedical concepts. The characteristic of the Metathesaurus most relevant for this project is that each concept is associated with a semantic type that categorizes the concept into subareas of biology or medicine. Examples pertinent to binding terminology include the semantic types &apos;Amino Acid, P</context>

Text with locally-defined acronyms expanded is submitted to the Xerox tagger and the SPECIALIST parser. Subsequent processing concentrates on the heads of simple noun 189 phrases and proceeds in a series of cascaded steps that depend on existing domain knowledge as well as several small, special-purpose resources in order to determine whether each noun phrase encountered is to be considered a binding term. As the first step in the process, an existing program, MetaMap, (Aronson et al. 1994) attempts to map each simple noun phrase to a concept in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The semantic type for concepts corresponding to successfully mapped noun phrases is then checked against a small subset of UMLS semantic types referring to bindable entities, such as &apos;Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein&apos;, &apos;Nucleotide Sequence&apos;, &apos;Carbohydrate&apos;, &apos;Cell&apos;, and &apos;Virus&apos;. For concepts with a semantic type in this set, the corresponding noun phrase is considered to be a binding term. The heads of noun phrases that do not map to a concept in the Metathesaurus are tested against a small set of general &amp;quot;binding w</context>

The set of binding words includes such nouns as cleft, groove, membrane, ligand, motif, receptor, domain, element, and molecule. The head of a noun phrase that did not submit to the preceding steps is examined to see whether it adheres to the morphologic shape of a normal English word. In this context such a word is often an acronym not defined locally and indicates the presence of a binding term (Fukuda et al. 1998). A normal English word has at least one vowel and no digits, and a text token that contains at least one letter and is not a normal English word functions as a binding word in this context. The final step in identifying binding terms is to join contiguous simple noun phrases qualifying as binding terms into a single macro-noun phrase. Rindflesch et al. (1999) use the term &amp;quot;macro-noun phrase&amp;quot; to refer to structures that include reduced relative clauses (commonly introduced by prepositions or participles) as well as appositives.

The emerging technology of information extraction (Appelt and Israel 1997, Hearst 1999) provides a means of gaining access to this information. In this paper we report on a project to extract biomolecular data from biomedical text. We concentrate on molecular binding affinity, which provides a strong indication of macromolecular function and is a core phenomenon in molecular biology. Our ultimate goal is to automatically construct a database of binding relationships asserted in MEDLINE citations. The National Library of Medicine&apos;s MEDLINE textual database is an online repository of more than 10 million citations from the biomedical literature.

However, Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein maps to the corresponding Metathesaurus concept with semantic type &apos;Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein, thus causing it to be more specific than a single lipidbinding site. The second predication listed in (10) was correctly extracted due to coordination processing. ARBIThR pursues limited coordination identification in the spirit of Agarwal and Boggess (1992) and Rindflesch (1995). Only binding terms are considered as candidates for coordination. For each conjunction encountered, the phrase immediately to the right is examined; if it is a binding term, all contiguous binding terms occurring immediately to the left of the conjunct are considered to be coordinate with the right conjunct. Coordination inside the simple noun phrase is not considered, and therefore structures such as The TCR alpha beta or -gamma delta chains are not recognized. Nonetheless, as indicated in (11), this limited approach to noun phrase coordination is often effective. (11) Purified recombinant </context>

An example of the output from the SPECIALIST parser is given below in (4). The partial parse produced serves as the basis for the first phase of extraction of binding relationships, namely the identification of those simple noun phrases acting as potential binding arguments (referred to as &amp;quot;binding terms&amp;quot;). 1.1 Identifying binding terminology In order to identify binding terminology in text we rely on the approach discussed in (Rindflesch et al. 1999). Text with locally-defined acronyms expanded is submitted to the Xerox tagger and the SPECIALIST parser. Subsequent processing concentrates on the heads of simple noun 189 phrases and proceeds in a series of cascaded steps that depend on existing domain knowledge as well as several small, special-purpose resources in order to determine whether each noun phrase encountered is to be considered a binding term. As the first step in the process, an existing program, MetaMap, (Aronson et al. 1994) attempts to map each simple noun phrase to a concept in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The semantic type for </context>

(1999)" startWordPosition="1488" endWordPosition="1491">t did not submit to the preceding steps is examined to see whether it adheres to the morphologic shape of a normal English word. In this context such a word is often an acronym not defined locally and indicates the presence of a binding term (Fukuda et al. 1998). A normal English word has at least one vowel and no digits, and a text token that contains at least one letter and is not a normal English word functions as a binding word in this context. The final step in identifying binding terms is to join contiguous simple noun phrases qualifying as binding terms into a single macro-noun phrase. Rindflesch et al. (1999) use the term &amp;quot;macro-noun phrase&amp;quot; to refer to structures that include reduced relative clauses (commonly introduced by prepositions or participles) as well as appositives. Two binding terms joined by a form of be are also treated as though they formed a macro-noun phrase, as in Je142 is an IgG which binds ... The results of identifying binding terms (and thus potential binding arguments) are given in (4) for the sentence in (3). In (4) evidence supporting identification as a binding term is given in braces. Note that in the underspecified syntactic analysis, prepositional phrases are treated a</context>
