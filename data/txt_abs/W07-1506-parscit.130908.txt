<newSection> Abstract This paper introduces a new, reversible method for converting syntactic structures with discontinuous constituents into traditional syntax trees.
The method is applied to the Tiger Corpus of German and results for PCFG parsing requiring such contextfree trees are provided.
A labeled dependency evaluation shows that the new conversion method leads to better results by preserving local relationships and introducing fewer inconsistencies into the training data.
