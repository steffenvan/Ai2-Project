<newSection> Abstract This paper details our experiments carried out at Word Sense Induction task.
For the foreign language (especially English), there have been many studies of word sense induction (WSI), and the approaches and the techniques are more and more mature.
However, the study of Chinese WSI is just getting started, and there has not been a better way to solve the problems encountered.
WSI can be divided into two categories: supervised manner and unsupervised manner.
But in the light of the high cost of supervised manner, we introduce novel solutions to automatic and unsupervised WSI.
In this paper, we propose two different systems.
The first one is called K-means-based Chinese word sense induction in an unsupervised manner while the second one is graph-based Chinese word sense induction.
In the experiments, the first system has achieved a 0.7729 Fscore on average while the second one has achieved a 0.6067 Fscore.
