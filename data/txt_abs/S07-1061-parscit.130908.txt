<newSection> Abstract This article introduces an unsupervised word sense disambiguation algorithm that is inspired by the lexical attraction models of Yuret (1998).
It is based on the assumption that the meanings of the words that form a sentence can be best assigned by constructing an interpretation of the whole sentence.
This interpretation is facilitated by a dependency-like context specification of a content word within the sentence.
Thus, finding the context words of a target word is a matter of finding a pseudo-syntactic dependency analysis of the sentence, called a linkage.
