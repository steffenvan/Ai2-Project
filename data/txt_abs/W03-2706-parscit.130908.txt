<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present a framework for task oriented dialogue systems that separates as much as possible the different concerns in the design of the system.
Specifically, we address how policies that control the form of interaction can be specified independently of domain or language specific specifications.
We illustrate the application of policies by way of specifying three confirmation policies and apply them to four different dialogue systems.
