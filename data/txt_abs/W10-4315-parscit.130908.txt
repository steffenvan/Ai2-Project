<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present a reference model based on Reference Domain Theory that can work both in interpretation and generation.
We introduce a formalization of key concepts of RDT, the interpretation and generation algorithms and show an example of behavior in the dynamic, asymmetric and multimodal GIVE environment.
