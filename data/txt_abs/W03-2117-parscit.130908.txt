<newSection> Abstract We present a light-weight tool for the annotation of linguistic data on multiple levels.
It is based on the simplification of annotations to sets of markables having attributes and standing in certain relations to each other.
We describe the main features of the tool, emphasizing its simplicity, customizability and versatility.
