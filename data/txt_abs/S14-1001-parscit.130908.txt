<newSection> Abstract We present two Twitter datasets annotated with coarse-grained word senses (supersenses), as well as a series of experiments with three learning scenarios for supersense tagging: weakly supervised learning, as well as unsupervised and supervised domain adaptation.
We show that (a) off-the-shelf tools perform poorly on Twitter, (b) models augmented with embeddings learned from Twitter data perform much better, and (c) errors can be reduced using type-constrained inference with distant supervision from WordNet.
