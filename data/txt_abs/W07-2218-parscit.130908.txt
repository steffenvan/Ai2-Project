<newSection> Abstract We propose a generative dependency parsing model which uses binary latent variables to induce conditioning features.
To define this model we use a recently proposed class of Bayesian Networks for structured prediction, Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks.
We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different languages.
We also demonstrate that the features induced by the ISBNâ€™s latent variables are crucial to this success, and show that the proposed model is particularly good on long dependencies.
