<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe the machine learning systems that we submitted to the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task on Learning to Detect Hedges and Their Scope in Natural Language Text.
Task 1 on detecting uncertain information was performed by an SVM-based system to process the Wikipedia data and by a memory-based system to process the biological data.
Task 2 on resolving in-sentence scopes of hedge cues, was performed by a memory-based system that relies on information from syntactic dependencies.
This system scored the highest F1 (57.32) of Task 2.
