<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we propose a three-step multilingual dependency parser, which generalizes an efficient parsing algorithm at first phase, a root parser and postprocessor at the second and third stages.
The main focus of our work is to provide an efficient parser that is practical to use with combining only lexical and part-ofspeech features toward language independent parsing.
The experimental results show that our method outperforms Maltparser in 13 languages.
We expect that such an efficient model is applicable for most languages.
