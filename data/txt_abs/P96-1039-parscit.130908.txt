Abstract The lower tier in the information structure representation specifies the semantic material that is in &quot;focus&quot; within themes and rhemes.
Material may be in focus for a variety of reasons, such as to emphasize its &quot;new&quot; status in the discourse, or to contrast it with other salient material.
Such focal distinctions may affect the linguistic presentation of information.
For example, the it-cleft in (1) may mark John as standing in contrast to some other recently mentioned person.
Similarly, in (2), the pitch accent on red may mark the referenced car as standing in contrast to some other car inferable from the discourse context.'
This paper presents an architecture for the generation of spoken monologues with contextually appropriate intonation.
A two-tiered information structure representation is used in the high-level content planning and sentence planning stages of generation to produce efficient, coherent speech that makes certain discourse relationships, such as explicit contrasts, appropriately salient.
The system is able to produce appropriate intonational patterns that cannot be generated by other systems which rely solely on word class and given/new distinctions.
