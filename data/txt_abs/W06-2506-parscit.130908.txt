<newSection> Abstract This paper presents an analysis of semantic association norms for German nouns.
In contrast to prior studies, we not only collected associations elicited by written representations of target objects but also by their pictorial representations.
In a first analysis, we identified systematic differences in the type and distribution of associate responses for the two presentation forms.
In a second analysis, we applied a soft cluster analysis to the collected target-response pairs.
We subsequently used the clustering to predict noun ambiguity and to discriminate senses in our target nouns.
