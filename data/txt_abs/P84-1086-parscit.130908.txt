INTRODUCTION Linguistic knowledge usable for machine translation is always imperfect.
We cannot be free from the uncertainty of knowledge we have for machine translation.
Especially at the transfer stage of machine translation, the selection of target language expression is rather subjective and optional.
Therefore the linguistic contents of machine translation system always fluctuate, and make gradual progress.
The system should be designed to allow such constant change and improvements.
This paper explains the details of the transfer and generation stages of Japanese-to-English system of the machine translation project by the Japanese Government, with the emphasis on the ideas to deal with the incompleteness of linguistic knowledge for machine translation.
