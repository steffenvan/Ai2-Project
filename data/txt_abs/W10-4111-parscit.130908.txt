<newSection> Abstract The study on Automatic Recognizing usages of Modern Chinese Adverbs is one of the important parts of the NLP-oriented research of Chinese Functional words Knowledge Base.
To solve the problems of the existing rule-based method of adverbs’ usages recognition based on the previous work, this paper has studied automatically recognizing common Chinese adverbs’ usages using statistical methods.
Three statistical models, viz.
CRF, ME, and SVM, are used to label several common Chinese adverbs’ usages on the segmentation and part-of-speech tagged corpus of People’s Daily(Jan 1998).
The experiment results show that statistical-based method is effective in automatically recognizing of several common adverbs’ usages and has good application prospects.
