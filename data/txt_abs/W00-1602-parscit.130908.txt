<newSection> Abstract Context free grammars parse faster than TFS grammars, but have disadvantages.
On our test TFS grammar, precompilation into CFG results in a speedup of 16 times for parsing without taking into account additional mechanisms for increasing parsing efficiency.
A formal overview is given of precompilation and parsing.
Modifications to ALE rules permit a closure over the rules from the lexicon, and analysis leading to a fast treatment of semantic structure.
The closure algorithm, and retrieval of full semantic structure are described.
