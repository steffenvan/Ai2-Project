<newSection> Abstract This paper proposes a novel method to analyze syntactic dependencies and label semantic dependencies around both the verbal predicates and the nouns.
In this method, a probabilistic model is designed to obtain a global optimal result.
Moreover, a predicate identification model and a disambiguation model are proposed to label predicates and their senses.
The experimental results obtained on the wsj and brown test sets show that our system obtains 77% of labeled macro F1 score for the whole task, 84.47% of labeled attachment score for syntactic dependency task, and 69.45% of labeled F1 score for semantic dependency task.
