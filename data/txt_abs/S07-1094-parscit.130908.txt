<newSection> Abstract For the Affective Text task at SemEval2007, University Paris 7â€™s system first evaluates emotion and valence on all words of a news headline (using enriched versions of SentiWordNet and a subset of WordNet-Affect).
We use a parser to find the head word, considering that it has a major importance.
We also detect contrasts (between positive and negative words) that shift valence.
Our knowledge-based system achieves high accuracy on emotion and valence annotation.
These results show that working with linguistic techniques and a broad-coverage lexicon is a viable approach to sentiment analysis of headlines.
