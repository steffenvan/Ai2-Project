<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a Named Entities (NE) recognition system for the English written language, which combines the wealth of the WORDNET taxonomy and the effectiveness of traditional rule-based approaches.
The core of the system relies on the combination of approximately 200 language-dependent rules with a set of predicates, defined on the WORDNET hierarchy, for the identification of both proper nouns and trigger words.
The strengths of this approach are twofold.
First, the use of a semantic network allows it to cope with the difficulty of building and maintaining extensive gazetteers.
Second, considering the recent spread of WORD NET-likesemantic networks for languages other than English and aligned with the English version, the use of language-independent predicates offers a useful basis for achieving multilinguality.
