<newSection> Abstract We introduce a number of novel techniques to lexical substitution, including an application of the Forward-Backward algorithm, a grammatical relation based similarity measure, and a modified form of n-gram matching.
We test these techniques on the SEMEVAL-2007 lexical substitution data [McCarthy and Navigli, 2007], to demonstrate their competitive performance.
We create a similar (small scale) dataset for Czech, and our evaluation demonstrates language independence of the techniques.
