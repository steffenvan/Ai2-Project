<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the Cambridge University Engineering Department submission to the Fifth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.
We report results for the French-English and Spanish-English shared translation tasks in both directions.
The CUED system is based on HiFST, a hierarchical phrase-based decoder implemented using weighted finite-state transducers.
In the French-English task, we investigate the use of context-dependent alignment models.
We also show that lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding is an effective framework for multi-source translation, leading to large gains in BLEU score.
