<newSection> Abstract In this paper we discuss the use of multilayered tagsets for dialogue acts, in the context of dialogue understanding for multiparty meeting recording and retrieval applications.
We discuss some desiderata for such tagsets and critically examine some previous proposals.
We then define MAL-TUS, a new tagset based on the ICSI-MR and Switchboard tagsets, which satisfies these requirements.
We present some experiments using MALTUS which attempt to compare the merits of integrated versus multi-level classifiers for the detection of dialogue acts.
