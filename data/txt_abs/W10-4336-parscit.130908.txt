<newSection> Abstract We point out several problems in scaling-up statistical approaches to spoken dialogue systems to enable them to deal with complex but natural user goals, such as disjunctive and negated goals and preferences.
In particular, we explore restrictions imposed by current independence assumptions in POMDP dialogue models.
This position paper proposes the use of Automatic Belief Compression methods to remedy these problems.
