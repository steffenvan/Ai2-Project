<newSection> Abstract We present a joint model of three core tasks in the entity analysis stack: coreference resolution (within-document clustering), named entity recognition (coarse semantic typing), and entity linking (matching to Wikipedia entities).
Our model is formally a structured conditional random field.
Unary factors encode local features from strong baselines for each task.
We then add binary and ternary factors to capture cross-task interactions, such as the constraint that coreferent mentions have the same semantic type.
On the ACE 2005 and OntoNotes datasets, we achieve state-of-theart results for all three tasks.
Moreover, joint modeling improves performance on each task over strong independent baselines.1
