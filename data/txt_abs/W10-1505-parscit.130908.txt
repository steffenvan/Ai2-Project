<newSection> Abstract This paper introduces Web1T5-Easy, a simple indexing solution that allows interactive searches of the Web 1T 5-gram database and a derived database of quasi-collocations.
The latter is validated against co-occurrence data from the BNC and ukWaC on the automatic identification of non-compositional VPC.
