<newSection> 2 They played it everyday after school before dinner.
3 After their game, the two usually went for ice cream cones.
4 They tasted really good.
5 Alfred always had the vanilla super scooper, 6 while Zohar tried the flavor of the day cone.
7 After the cones had been eaten, 8 the boys went home to study.
In this example, the discourse focusses initially on baseball.
The focus moves in D1-3 to the ice cream cone.
Using this example, I show how the formal algorithm computes focus and determines how the focus moves according to the signals which the speaker uses in discourse to indicate the movement.
Given a process notion of focus, the paper reviews the difficulties with previous approaches (Rieger [1974], Charniak [1972], Winograd [1971], Hobbs [1975] and Lock tnan [1978]).
Briefly, the first four authors all point out the need for inferencing as part of anaphora disambiguation, but each of their schemes for inferencing suffer from the need for control which will reduce the combinatorial search or which will insure only one search path is taken.
In addition, Winograd and Lockman are aware of pronoun phenomena which cannot be treated strictly by inference, as shown below.
