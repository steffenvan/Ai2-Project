<newSection> ISBN 978-1-932432-11-4 Research in computational linguistics in the biomedical domain traditionally focuses on two major areas: fundamental advances in language processing; and application of language processing methods to bridge the gap between basic biomedical research, clinical research, and translation of both types of research into practice.
Several conferences provide opportunities for discussion of these two types of research in specific sub-domains of Biomedical Natural Language Processing.
For example, Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) and its associated special interest group and Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) focus on NLP research applied to issues of interest to biologists, whereas American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) is concerned with medical informatics issues.
Rather than focusing on a specific area of interest, ACL BioNLP workshop strives to provide a forum for any important, new, and exciting research in the field of Biomedical Natural Language Processing.
Rather than focusing on a specific theme as we have in previous years, the goal of the workshop this year was to solicit work of interest to NLP researchers on any topic in the biomedical domain.
Submissions, acceptance, and themes Asking researchers to share their interests was rewarded by 34 submissions (5 posters and 19 full papers).
Of those, 10 were accepted as full papers and 18 as poster presentations.
The combined expertise of the program committee allowed for providing three thorough reviews for each paper.
The exceptionally high quality manuscripts accepted for presentation cover a wide area of subjects in clinical and biological areas, as well as methodological issues applicable to both sublanguages.
Named entity recognition (NER) continues to be an active area of research.
NER research presented here involves development of new statistical and hybrid approaches to identification and disambiguation of gene [1], protein [2], chemical names [3], and clinical entities.
Overwhelmingly, researchers chose statistical or hybrid approaches to the tasks at hand.
This is probably the reason for growing interest in creation of annotated corpora [4], development of methods for augmenting the existing annotation [5], speeding up the annotation process [5], and reducing its cost; evaluating the comparability of results obtained applying the same methods to different collections [6], And increasing compatibility of different annotations [7].
Increasingly sophisticated relation extraction methods [6, 8] are being applied to a broader set of iii relations [9].
Other steps towards deeper understanding of the text include methods for creation of gene profiles [10], identification of uncertainty [11], discourse connectivity [12], and temporal features of clinical conditions [13].
The applicability of NLP methods to clinical tasks is explored in the work on identification of language impairments [14] and seriousness of suicidal attempts [15].
Finally, application of NLP methods to classic information retrieval problems such as automatic indexing of biomedical literature [16] and the newer information retrieval problem of image retrieval [17] are explored.
