<newSection> 1 Introduction Default unification represents a fundamental extension of the common unification operation, where even in case of inconsistency between the information to be merged, there will always be a result.
As default unification is no longer a commutative operation, a distinction is made between the argument containing default information, the background, and the other argument consisting of non-default information, the cover.
An elegant point of departure to formalizing default unification has been delivered by Carpenter’s credulous default unification (CDU) (Carpenter, 1993): Unlike previous strategies to replace conflicting parts by the non-default information (Shieber, 1986; Kaplan, 1987; Bouma, 1990), Carpenter suggests in case of clashes to relax the specificity in the defeasible part to achieve consistency with the non-default structure.
Since the detection of the generalized default might not be deterministic, multiple results may arise.

c�2009 International Conference on Computational Semantics A CDU formalization in (Alexandersson & Becker, 2007) is used in the SMARTKOM system (Wahlster, 2006) on the basis of typed feature structures (TFS) and CDU as the knowledge representation and inference mechanism, in order to monitor the discourse processing, where the user’s input, the cover, updates the internal dialogue state, the background, see figure 1.
The second crucial point of departure is how Alexandersson and Becker understand to exploit the information inherent to an inheritance hierarchy and henceforward to transfer Carpenter’s notion to a very effective and sound way to specify CDU, which stands in contrast to the formalization by (Grover, Brew, Manandhar, & Moens, 1994)' that suffers from theoretical and computational drawbacks.
This Work (Schulz, 2007) develops an extension to the CDU operation presented in (Alexandersson & Becker, 2007) for which the CDU algorithm is adapted to deal with multiple inheritance type hierarchies omitting the requirement to be bounded complete.
