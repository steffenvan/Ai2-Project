<newSection> Abstract Hedge cues were detected using a supervised Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier exploiting features from the RASP parser.
The CRFâ€™s predictions were filtered using known cues and unseen instances were removed, increasing precision while retaining recall.
Rules for scope detection, based on the grammatical relations of the sentence and the part-ofspeech tag of the cue, were manually-developed.
However, another supervised CRF classifier was used to refine these predictions.
As a final step, scopes were constructed from the classifier output using a small set of post-processing rules.
Development of the system revealed a number of issues with the annotation scheme adopted by the organisers.
