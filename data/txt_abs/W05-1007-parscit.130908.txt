<newSection> Abstract SemFrame generates FrameNet-like frames, complete with semantic roles and evoking lexical units.
This output can enhance FrameNet by suggesting new frames, as well as additional lexical units that evoke existing frames.
SemFrame output can also support the addition of frame semantic relationships to WordNet.
