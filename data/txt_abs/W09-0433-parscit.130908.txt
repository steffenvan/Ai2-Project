<newSection> Abstract Chinese and Korean belong to different language families in terms of word-order and morphological typology.
Chinese is an SVO and morphologically poor language while Korean is an SOV and morphologically rich one.
In Chinese-to-Korean SMT systems, systematic differences between the verbal systems of the two languages make the generation of Korean verbal phrases difficult.
To resolve the difficulties, we address two issues in this paper.
The first issue is that the verb position is different from the viewpoint of word-order typology.
The second is the difficulty of complex morphology generation of Korean verbs from the viewpoint of morphological typology.
We propose a Chinese syntactic reordering that is better at generating Korean verbal phrases in Chinese-to-Korean SMT.
Specifically, we consider reordering rules targeting Chinese verb phrases (VPs), preposition phrases (PPs), and modality-bearing words that are closely related to Korean verbal phrases.
We verify our system with two corpora of different domains.
Our proposed approach significantly improves the performance of our system over a baseline phrased-based SMT system.
The relative improvements in the two corpora are +9.32% and +5.43%, respectively.
