<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present a parallel context sensitive graph rewriting formalism for a dependency-oriented generation grammar.
The parallel processing of the input structure makes an explicit presentation of all alternative options for its mapping onto the output structure possible.
This allows for the selection of the linguistic realization that suits best the communicative and contextual criteria available.
