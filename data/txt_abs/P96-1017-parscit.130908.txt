<newSection> Abstract We propose a treatment of coordination based on the concepts of functor, argument and sub categorization.
Its formalization comprises two parts which are conceptually independent.
On one hand, we have extended the feature structure unification to disjunctive and set values in order to check the compatibility and the satisfiability of sub categorization requirements by structured complements.
On the other hand, we have considered the conjunction et (and) as the head of the coordinate structure, so that coordinate structures stem simply from the subcategorization specifications of et and the general schemata of a head saturation.
Both parts have been encoded within HPSG using the same resource that is the subcategorization and its principle which we have just extended.

Un livre interessant et que j'aurai du plaisir a lire.

Je demande a Pierre son velo et h Marie sa canne a peche.
(Peter sells a bike and gives a fishing rod to Mary.)
We claim here that the &quot;local combinatory potential&quot; of lexical heads, encoded in the subcategorization feature, explains the previous linguistic facts: conjuncts may be of different categories as well as of more than one constituent, they just have to satisfy the sub categorization constraints.
