<newSection> Abstract The paper describes a proposal for computer-based aids for patients with limited or no English.
The paper describes the barriers to health-care experienced due to linguistic problems, then suggests some computer-based remedies incorporating a multi-engine machine translation system based on a corpus of doctorâ€” patient interviews which provides a dialogue model for the system.
The doctor's and patient's interfaces are described.
Ideas from Augmentative and Alternative Communication and in particular picture-based communication are incorporated.
The initial proposal will focus on Urdu- and Somali-speaking patients with respiratory problems.
