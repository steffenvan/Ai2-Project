<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our contribution to the SemEval-2015 task 17 on “Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation”.
We propose a hypernym detection system combining three modules: a lexico-syntactic pattern matcher, a morphosyntactic analyzer and a module retrieving hypernym relations from structured lexical resources.
Our system ranked first in the competition when considering the gold standard and manual evaluation, and second in the overall ranking.
In addition, the experimental results show that all modules contribute to finding hypernym relations between terms.
