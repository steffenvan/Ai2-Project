<newSection> Abstract In this paper, a method is presented to recognize multilingual Wikipedia named entity articles.
This method classifies multilingual Wikipedia articles using a variety of structured and unstructured features and is aided by cross-language links and features in Wikipedia.
Adding multilingual features helps boost classification accuracy and is shown to effectively classify multilingual pages in a language independent way.
Classification is done using Support Vectors Machine (SVM) classifier at first, and then the threshold of SVM is adjusted in order to improve the recall scores of classification.
Threshold adjustment is performed using beta-gamma threshold adjustment algorithm which is a post learning step that shifts the hyperplane of SVM.
This approach boosted recall with minimal effect on precision.
