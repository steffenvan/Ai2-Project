<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present a system for detecting negation in English text.
We address three tasks: negation cue detection, negation scope resolution and negated event identification.
We pose these tasks as sequence labeling problems.
For each task, we train a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model on lexical, structural, and syntactic features extracted from labeled data.
The models are trained and tested using the dataset distributed with the *sem Shared Task 2012 on resolving the scope and focus of negation.
The system detects negation cues with 90.98% F1 measure (94.3% and 87.88% recall).
It identifies negation scope with 82.70% F1 on token-bytoken level and 64.78% F1 on full scope level.
Negated events are detected with 51.10% F1 measure.
