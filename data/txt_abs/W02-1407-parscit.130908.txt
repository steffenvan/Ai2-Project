<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we propose a new idea for the automatic recognition of domain specific terms.
Our idea is based on the statistics between a compound noun and its component single-nouns.
More precisely, we focus basically on how many nouns adjoin the noun in question to form compound nouns.
We propose several scoring methods based on this idea and experimentally evaluate them on the NTCIR1 TMREC test collection.
The results are very promising especially in the low recall area.
