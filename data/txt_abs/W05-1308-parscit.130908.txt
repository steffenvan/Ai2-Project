<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present a fully automated extraction system, named IntEx, to identify gene and protein interactions in biomedical text.
Our approach is based on first splitting complex sentences into simple clausal structures made up of syntactic roles.
Then, tagging biological entities with the help of biomedical and linguistic ontologies.
Finally, extracting complete interactions by analyzing the matching contents of syntactic roles and their linguistically significant combinations.
Our extraction system handles complex sentences and extracts multiple and nested interactions specified in a sentence.
Experimental evaluations with two other state of the art extraction systems indicate that the IntEx system achieves better performance without the labor intensive pattern engineering requirement.
