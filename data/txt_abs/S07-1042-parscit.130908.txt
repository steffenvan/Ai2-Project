<newSection> 2 Approaches Our framework focuses on the K-means clustering model using both bag of words as features and various augumented feature sets.
We experimented with several similarity functions and chose Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient1 as the distance measure for clustering.
The weights for the features were set to the term frequency of their respective words in the document.2 2.1 Submitted system: Clustering using Web Snippets We queried the Google search engine with the target person names and extracted up to the top one thousand results.
For each result we also extracted the snippet associated with it.
An example is shown below in Figure 2.1.
As can be seen the
