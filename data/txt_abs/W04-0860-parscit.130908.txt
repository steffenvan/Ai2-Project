<newSection> Abstract The R2D2 systems for the English All-Words and Lexical Sample tasks at SENSEVAL-3 are based on several supervised and unsupervised methods combined by means of a voting procedure.
Main goal was to take advantage of training data when available, and getting maximum coverage with the help of methods that not need such learning examples.
The results reported in this paper show that supervised and unsupervised methods working in parallel, and a simple sequence of preferences when comparing the answers of such methods, is a feasible method...
The whole system is, in fact, a cascade of decisions of what label to assign to a concrete instance based on the agreement of pairs of systems, when it is possible, or selecting the available answer from one of them.
In this way, supervised are preferred to unsupervised methods, but these last ones are able to tag such words that not have available training data.
