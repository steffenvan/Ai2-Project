<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our participation in the the SemEval-2010 Task #12, Parser Evaluation using Textual Entailment.
Our system incorporated two dependency parsers, one semantic role labeler, and a deep parser based on hand-crafted grammars.
The shortest path algorithm is applied on the graph representation of the parser outputs.
Then, different types of features are extracted and the entailment recognition is casted into a machine-learning-based classification task.
The best setting of the system achieves 66.78% of accuracy, which ranks the 3rd place.
