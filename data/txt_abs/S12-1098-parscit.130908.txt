<newSection> Abstract Sentences that are syntactically quite different can often have similar or same meaning.
The SemEval 2012 task of Semantic Textual Similarity aims at finding the semantic similarity between two sentences.
The semantic representation of Universal Networking Language (UNL), represents only the inherent meaning in a sentence without any syntactic details.
Thus, comparing the UNL graphs of two sentences can give an insight into how semantically similar the two sentences are.
This paper presents the UNL graph matching method for the Semantic Textual Similarity(STS) task.
