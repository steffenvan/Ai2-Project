<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our word segmentation system and named entity recognition (NER) system for participating in the third SIGHAN Bakeoff.
Both of them are based on character tagging, but use different tag sets and different features.
Evaluation results show that our word segmentation system achieved 93.3% and 94.7% F-score in UPUC and MSRA open tests, and our NER system got 70.84% and 81.32% F-score in LDC and MSRA open tests.
