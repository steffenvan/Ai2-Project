<newSection> Abstract This paper discusses a new, open-source software program, called Phon, that is designed for the transcription, coding, and analysis of phonological corpora.
Phon provides support for multimedia data linkage, segmentation, multiple-blind transcription, transcription validation, syllabification, alignment of target and actual forms, and data analysis.
All of these functions are available through a user-friendly graphical interface.
Phon, available on most computer platforms, supports data exchange among researchers with the TalkBank XML document format and the Unicode character set..
This program provides the basis for the elaboration of PhonBank, a database project that seeks to broaden the scope of CHILDES into phonological development and disorders.
