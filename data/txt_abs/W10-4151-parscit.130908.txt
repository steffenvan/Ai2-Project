<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a complete syntactic analysis system based on multi-level chunking.
On the basis of the correct sequences of Chinese words provided by CLP2010, the system firstly has a Part-ofspeech (POS) tagging with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and then does the base chunking and complex chunking with Maximum Entropy (ME), and finally generates a complete syntactic analysis tree.
The system took part in the Complete Sentence Parsing Track of the Task 2 Chinese Parsing in CLP2010, achieved the F-1 measure of 63.25% on the overall analysis, ranked the sixth; POS accuracy rate of 89.62%, ranked the third.
