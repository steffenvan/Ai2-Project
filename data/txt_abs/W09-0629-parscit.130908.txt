<newSection> Abstract The TUNA-REG’09 Challenge was one of the shared-task evaluation competitions at Generation Challenges 2009.
TUNA-REG’09 used data from the TUNA Corpus of paired representations of entities and human-authored referring expressions.
The shared task was to create systems that generate referring expressions for entities given representations of sets of entities and their properties.
Four teams submitted six systems to TUNA-REG’09.
We evaluated the six systems and two sets of human-authored referring expressions using several automatic intrinsic measures, a human-assessed intrinsic evaluation and a human task performance experiment.
This report describes the TUNA-REG task and the evaluation methods used, and presents the evaluation results.
