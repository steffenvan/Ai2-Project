<newSection> Abstract Named entity recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction (IE) which can be used further on for different purposes.
In this paper, we discuss named entity recognition for Ukrainian language, which is a Slavonic language with a rich morphology.
The approach we follow uses a restricted number of features.
We show that it is feasible to boost performance by considering several heuristics and patterns acquired from the Web data.
