<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we consider the application of topic modelling to the task of inducting grammar rules.
In particular, we look at the use of a recently developed method called orthonormal explicit topic analysis, which combines explicit and latent models of semantics.
Although, it remains unclear how topic model may be applied to the case of grammar induction, we show that it is not impossible and that this may allow the capture of subtle semantic distinctions that are not captured by other methods.
