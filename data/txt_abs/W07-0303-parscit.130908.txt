<newSection> Abstract The multimodal presentation dashboard allows users to control and browse presentation content such as slides and diagrams through a multimodal interface that supports speech and pen input.
In addition to control commands (e.g. “take me to slide 10”), the system allows multimodal search over content collections.
For example, if the user says “get me a slide about internet telephony,” the system will present a ranked series of candidate slides that they can then select among using voice, pen, or a wireless remote.
As presentations are loaded, their content is analyzed and language and understanding models are built dynamically.
This approach frees the user from the constraints of linear order allowing for a more dynamic and responsive presentation style.
