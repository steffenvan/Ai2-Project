<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a proposal to facilitate the use of the annotated web as corpus by alleviating the annotation bottleneck for corpus data drawn from the web.
We describe a framework for large-scale distributed corpus annotation using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to meet this need.
We also propose to annotate a large reference corpus in order to evaluate this framework.
This will allow us to investigate the affordances offered by distributed techniques to ensure replicability of linguistic research based on web-derived corpora.
