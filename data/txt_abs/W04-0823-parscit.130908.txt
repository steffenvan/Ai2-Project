<newSection> 3 Test Data The test set consists of 15,179 gold assigments from 9,257 glosses taked directly from XwN2.01.1 (see table 2).
However, this version is not free of errors and inconsistencies.
For instance, XWN has 724 word tagged senses not belonging to WN.
Three of them labelled as gold.
Furthermore, as we can see in table 3 the synset distributions of the test data and WN2.0 are very different.
In particular for adjective and adverbs.
Being the test data not representative of WN2.0, this test set misleads the global results and the final goal of the task.
