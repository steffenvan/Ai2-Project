<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the participation of the UNIBA team in the Task 13 of SemEval-2015 about Multilingual All-Words Sense Disambiguation and Entity Linking.
We propose an algorithm able to disambiguate both word senses and named entities by combining the simple Lesk approach with information coming from both a distributional semantic model and usage frequency of meanings.
The results for both English and Italian show satisfactory performance.
