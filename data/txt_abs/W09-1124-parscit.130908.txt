<newSection> Abstract This paper is concerned with statistical methods for treating long-distance dependencies.
We focus in particular on a case of substantial recent interest: that of long-distance dependency effects in entity extraction.
We introduce a new approach to capturing these effects through a simple feature copying preprocess, and demonstrate substantial performance gains on several entity extraction tasks.
