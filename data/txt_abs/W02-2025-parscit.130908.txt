<newSection> 1 Introduction We apply a memory-based learner to the CoNLL-2002 shared task: language-independent named entity recognition.
We use three additional techniques for improving the base performance of the learner: cascading, feature selection and system combination.
The overall system is trained with two types of features: words and substrings of words which are relevant for this particular task.
It is tested on the two language pairs that were available for this shared task: Spanish and Dutch.
