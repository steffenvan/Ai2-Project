<newSection> Abstract We propose a new XML format for representing interlinearized glossed text (IGT), particularly in the context of the documentation and description of endangered languages.
The proposed representation, which we call IGT-XML, builds on previous models but provides a more loosely coupled and flexible representation of different annotation layers.
Designed to accommodate both selective manual reannotation of individual layers and semi-automatic extension of annotation, IGT-XML is a first step toward partial automation of the production of IGT.
