<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a system for syntactic-semantic dependency parsing for multiple languages.
The system consists of three parts: a state-of-the-art higher-order projective dependency parser for syntactic dependency parsing, a predicate classifier, and an argument classifier for semantic dependency parsing.
For semantic dependency parsing, we explore use of global features.
All components are trained with an approximate max-margin learning algorithm.
In the closed challenge of the CoNLL-2009 Shared Task (HajiË‡c et al., 2009), our system achieved the 3rd best performances for English and Czech, and the 4th best performance for Japanese.
