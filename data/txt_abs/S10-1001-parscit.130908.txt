<newSection> Abstract This paper presents the SemEval-2010 task on Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages.
The goal was to evaluate and compare automatic coreference resolution systems for six different languages (Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian, and Spanish) in four evaluation settings and using four different metrics.
Such a rich scenario had the potential to provide insight into key issues concerning coreference resolution: (i) the portability of systems across languages, (ii) the relevance of different levels of linguistic information, and (iii) the behavior of scoring metrics.
