<newSection> Abstract Sehdaâ€™s 2-way speech translation system, S-MINDS, interprets between provider and patient in routine medical interactions with very high accuracy.
Optimizing the system for new tasks or languages requires very little data.
New developments include a hybrid translation approach that allows participants to say complex or out-ofdomain utterances, the expansion of hands-free functionality, and the ability to deliver the most urgent expressions instantaneously.
