<newSection> Abstract This paper describes how grammar-based language models for speech recognition systems can be generated from Grammatical Framework (GF) grammars.
Context-free grammars and finite-state models can be generated in several formats: GSL, SRGS, JSGF, and HTK SLF.
In addition, semantic interpretation code can be embedded in the generated context-free grammars.
This enables rapid development of portable, multilingual and easily modifiable speech recognition applications.
