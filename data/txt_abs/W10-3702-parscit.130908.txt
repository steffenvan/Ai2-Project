<newSection> Abstract The morphosyntactic treatment of multiword units is particularly challenging in morphologically rich languages.
We present a comparative study of two formalisms meant for lexicalized description of MWUs in Polish.
We show their expressive power and describe encoding experiments, involving novice and expert lexicographers, and allowing to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of both implementations.
