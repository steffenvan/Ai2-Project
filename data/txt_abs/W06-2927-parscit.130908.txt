<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present a framework for multi-lingual dependency parsing.
Our bottom-up deterministic parser adopts Nivre’s algorithm (Nivre, 2004) with a preprocessor.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are utilized to determine the word dependency attachments.
Then, a maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) is used for determining the label of the dependency relation.
To improve the performance of the parser, we construct a tagger based on SVMs to find neighboring attachment as a preprocessor.
Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed extension improves the parsing accuracy of our base parser in 9 languages.
