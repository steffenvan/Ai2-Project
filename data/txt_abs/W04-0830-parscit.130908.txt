<newSection> 5 Conclusion This paper presents a new approach based on neural networks to disambiguate the word senses.
We have used the LVQ algorithm to train a neural network to carry out the English lexical sample and English all words tasks.
We have integrated two linguistic resources in the corpus provided by the organization: WordNet and SemCor.
