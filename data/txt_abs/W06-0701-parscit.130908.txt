<newSection> Abstract A key task in an extraction system for query-oriented multi-document summarisation, necessary for computing relevance and redundancy, is modelling text semantics.
In the Embra system, we use a representation derived from the singular value decomposition of a term co-occurrence matrix.
We present methods to show the reliability of performance improvements.
We find that Embra performs better with dimensionality reduction.
