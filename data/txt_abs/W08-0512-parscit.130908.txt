<newSection> Abstract Our work in this area started as a research project but when L2F joined TecnoVoz, a Portuguese national consortium including Academia and Industry partners, our focus shifted to real-time professional solutions.
The integration of our domain-independent Spoken Dialogue System (SDS) framework into commercial products led to a major reengineering process.
This paper describes the changes that the framework went through and that deeply affected its entire architecture.
The communication core was enhanced, the modules interfaces were redefined for an easier integration, the SDS deployment process was optimized and the framework robustness was improved.
The work was done according to software engineering guidelines and making use of design patterns.
