<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we explore a corpus of human-produced referring expressions to see to what extent we can learn the referential behaviour the corpus represents.
Despite a wide variation in the way subjects refer across a set of ten stimuli, we demonstrate that component elements of the referring expression generation process appear to generalise across participants to a significant degree.
This leads us to propose an alternative way of thinking of referring expression generation, where each attribute in a description is provided by a separate heuristic.
