<newSection> Abstract In this paper we develop an automatic classifier for a very large set of labels, the WordNet synsets.
We employ Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) because of their flexibility to include a wide variety of nonindependent features.
Training CRFs on a big number of labels proved a problem because of the large training cost.
By taking into account the hypernym/hyponym relation between synsets in WordNet, we reduced the complexity of training from O(TM2NG) to O(T (logM)2NG) with only a limited loss in accuracy.
