Abstract: Text recognition systems require the use of contextual information in order to maximise the accuracy of their output.
However, the acquisition of such knowledge for a realistically sized vocabulary presents a major problem.
This paper describes methods for extracting contextual knowledge from text corpora, and demonstrates its contribution to the performance of handwriting recognition systems.
