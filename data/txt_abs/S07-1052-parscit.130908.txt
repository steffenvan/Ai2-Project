<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we attempt to use a sequence labeling model with features from dependency parsed tree for temporal relation identification.
In the sequence labeling model, the relations of contextual pairs can be used as features for relation identification of the current pair.
Head-modifier relations between pairs of words within one sentence can be also used as the features.
In our preliminary experiments, these features are effective for the temporal relation identification tasks.
