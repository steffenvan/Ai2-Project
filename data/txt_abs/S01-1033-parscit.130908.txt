<newSection> Abstract We submitted four systems to the Japanese dictionary-based lexical-sample task of SENSEVAL-2.
They were i) the support vector machine method ii) the simple Bayes method, iii) a method combining the two, and iv) a method combining two kinds of each.
The combined methods obtained the best precision among the submitted systems.
After the contest, we tuned the parameter used in the simple Bayes method, and it obtained higher precision.
An explanation of these systems used in Japanese word sense disambiguation was provided.
