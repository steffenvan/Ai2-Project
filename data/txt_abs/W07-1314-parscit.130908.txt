<newSection> Abstract We use an iterative process of multi-gram alignment between associated words in different languages in an attempt to identify cognates.
To maximise the amount of data, we use practical orthographies instead of consistently coded phonetic transcriptions.
First results indicate that using practical orthographies can be useful, the more so when dealing with large amounts of data.
