<newSection> Abstract This paper proposes a dependency treebased SRL system with proper pruning and extensive feature engineering.
Official evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 shared task shows that our system achieves 76.19 in labeled macro F1 for the overall task, 84.56 in labeled attachment score for syntactic dependencies, and 67.12 in labeled F1 for semantic dependencies on combined test set, using the standalone MaltParser.
Besides, this paper also presents our unofficial system by 1) applying a new effective pruning algorithm; 2) including additional features; and 3) adopting a better dependency parser, MSTParser.
Unofficial evaluation on the shared task shows that our system achieves 82.53 in labeled macro F1, 86.39 in labeled attachment score, and 78.64 in labeled F1, using MSTParser on combined test set.
This suggests that proper pruning and extensive feature engineering contributes much in dependency tree-based SRL.
