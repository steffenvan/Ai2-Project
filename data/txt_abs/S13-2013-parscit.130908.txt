<newSection> Abstract We analyze the performance of SUTIME, a temporal tagger for recognizing and normalizing temporal expressions, on TempEval-3 Task A for English.
SUTIME is available as part of the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline and can be used to annotate documents with temporal information.
Testing on the TempEval-3 evaluation corpus showed that this system is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques.
