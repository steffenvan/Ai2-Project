<newSection> Abstract Because the ultimate purpose of the Semantic Web is to help users better locate, organize, and process content, we believe that it should be grounded in the information access method humans are most comfortable with natural language.
However, the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the foundation of the Semantic Web, was designed to be easily processed by computers, not humans.
To render RDF more friendly to humans, we propose to augment it with natural language annotations, or metadata written in everyday language.
We argue that natural language annotations, parsed into computer-readable representations, are not only intuitive and effective, but can also accelerate the pace with which the Semantic Web is being adopted.
We believe that our technology can facilitate a happy marriage between natural language technology and the Semantic Web vision.
