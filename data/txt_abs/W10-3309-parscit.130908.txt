<newSection> Abstract Opinion mining is a growing research area both at the natural language processing and the information retrieval communities.
Companies, politicians, as well as customers need powerful tools to track opinions, sentiments, judgments and beliefs that people may express in blogs, reviews, audios and videos data regarding a product/service/person/organisation/etc.
This work describes our contribution to feature based opinion mining where opinions expressed towards each feature of an object or a product are extracted and summarized.
The state of the art has shown that the hierarchical organization of features is a key step.
In this context, our goal is to study the role of a domain ontology to structure and extract object features as well as to produce a comprehensive summary.
This paper presents the developed system and the experiments we carried out on a case study: French restaurant reviews.
Our results show that our approach outperforms standard baselines.
