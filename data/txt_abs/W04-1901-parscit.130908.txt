<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe the construction of a new Japanese lexical resource: the Hinoki treebank.
The treebank is built from dictionary definition sentences, and uses an HPSG based Japanese grammar to encode the syntactic and semantic information.
We show how this treebank can be used to extract thesaurus information from definition sentences in a language-neutral way using minimal recursion semantics.
