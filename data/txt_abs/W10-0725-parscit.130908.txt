<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our experiments of using Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk to generate (counter-)facts from texts for certain named-entities.
We give the human annotators a paragraph of text and a highlighted named-entity.
They will write down several (counter-)facts about this named-entity in that context.
The analysis of the results is performed by comparing the acquired data with the recognizing textual entailment (RTE) challenge dataset.
