<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a general-purpose sentence generation system that can achieve both broad scale coverage and high quality while aiming to be suitable for a variety of generation tasks.
We measure the coverage and correctness empirically using a section of the Penn Treebank corpus as a test set.
We also describe novel features that help make the generator flexible and easier to use for a variety of tasks.
To our knowledge, this is the first empirical measurement of coverage reported in the literature, and the highest reported measurements of correctness.
