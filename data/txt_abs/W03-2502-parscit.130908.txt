<newSection> Abstract We investigate the effect of incorporating syntactic information into a word-completion algorithm.
We introduce two new algorithms that combine partof-speech tag trigrams with word hi-grams, and evaluate them with a test-bench constructed for the purpose.
The results show a small but statistically significant improvement in keystroke savings for one of our algorithms over baselines that use only word n-grams.
