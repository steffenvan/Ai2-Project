<newSection> Abstract Recent work on Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has shown that to achieve high accuracy a joint inference on the whole predicate argument structure should be applied.
In this paper, we used syntactic subtrees that span potential argument structures of the target predicate in tree kernel functions.
This allows Support Vector Machines to discern between correct and incorrect predicate structures and to re-rank them based on the joint probability of their arguments.
Experiments on the PropBank data show that both classification and re-ranking based on tree kernels can improve SRL systems.
