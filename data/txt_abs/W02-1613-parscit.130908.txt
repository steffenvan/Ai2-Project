<newSection> Abstract The translation choice and transfer modules in an English Chinese machine translation system are introduced.
The translation choice is realized on basis of a grammar tree and takes the context as a word bag, with the lexicon and POS tag information as context features.
The Bayes minimal error probability is taken as the evaluation function of the candidate translation.
The rule-based transfer and generation module takes the parsing tree as the input and operates on the information of POS tag, semantics or even the lexicon.
