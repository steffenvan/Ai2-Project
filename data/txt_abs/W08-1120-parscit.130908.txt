<newSection> Abstract Natural language generation technology is mature enough for implementing an NLG system in a commercial environment, but the circumstances differ significantly from building a research system.
This paper describes the challenges and rewards of building a commercial NLG component for an electronic medical records system.
While the resulting NLG system has been successfully completed, the path to that success could have been somewhat smoother knowing the issues in advance.
