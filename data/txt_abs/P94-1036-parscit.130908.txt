<newSection> Three Problems for LIG-Equivalent Formalisms The three problems we present are of a rather different nature.
The first arises from the way a linguistic problem is treated in a specific type of framework (unification-based formalisms).
The second problem derives directly from linguistic data.
The third problem is a formalism which has been motivated on independent, methodological grounds, but whose formal properties are unknown.
HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987; Pollard and Sag, 1994) uses typed feature structures as its formal basis, which are Turing-equivalent.
However, it is not necessarily
