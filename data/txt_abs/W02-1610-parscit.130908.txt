<newSection> Abstract We describe the design of an MT system that employs transfer rules induced from parsed bitexts and present evaluation results.
The system learns lexico-structural transfer rules using syntactic pattern matching, statistical co-occurrence and error-driven filtering.
In an experiment with domainspecific Korean to English translation, the approach yielded substantial improvements over three baseline systems.
