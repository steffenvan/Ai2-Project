<newSection> Abstract We present the diverse research activities on Philippine languages from all over the country, with focus on the Center for Language Technologies of the College of Computer Studies, De La Salle University, Manila, where majority of the work are conducted.
These projects include the formal representation of Philippine languages and the processes involving these languages.
Language representation entails the manual and automatic development of language resources such as lexicons and corpora for various human languages including Philippine languages, across various forms such as text, speech and video files.
Tools and applications on languages that we have worked on include morphological processes, part of speech tagging, language grammars, machine translation, sign language processing and speech systems.
Future directions are also presented.
