<newSection> Abstract Using the SemEval-2014 Task 8 data, we profile the syntactic tree parsing techniques for semantic graph parsing.
In particular, we implement different transition-based and graph-based models, as well as a parser ensembler, and evaluate their effectiveness for semantic dependency parsing.
Evaluation gauges how successful data-driven dependency graph parsing can be by applying existing techniques.
