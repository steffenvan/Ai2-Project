<newSection> Abstract This paper aims at understanding what human think in textual entailment (TE) recognition process and modeling their thinking process to deal with this problem.
We first analyze a labeled RTE-5 test set and find that the negative entailment phenomena are very effective features for TE recognition.
Then, a method is proposed to extract this kind of phenomena from text-hypothesis pairs automatically.
We evaluate the performance of using the negative entailment phenomena on both the English RTE-5 dataset and Chinese NTCIR-9 RITE dataset, and conclude the same findings.
