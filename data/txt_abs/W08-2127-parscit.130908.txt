<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our system to carry out the joint parsing of syntactic and semantic dependencies for our participation in the shared task of CoNLL-2008.
We illustrate that both syntactic parsing and semantic parsing can be transformed into a word-pair classification problem and implemented as a single-stage system with the aid of maximum entropy modeling.
Our system ranks the fourth in the closed track for the task with the following performance on the WSJ+Brown test set: 81.44% labeled macro F1 for the overall task, 86.66% labeled attachment for syntactic dependencies, and 76.16% labeled F1 for semantic dependencies.
