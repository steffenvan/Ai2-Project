I have argued above that conceptually-based domain-specific knowledge is absolutely essential for natural language database access systems.
Systems that rely on database structure for this domain-specific knowledge will not achieve an acceptable level of performance -- i.e. operate It the level of understanding of a programmer-technician.
Because of the requirement for domain-specific knowledge, conceptually-based systems are restricted to limited domains and are not readily portable to new content areas.
However, eliminating the domain-specific conceptual knowledge is throwing the baby out with the bath water.
The conceptually-based domain-specific knowledge is the key to robust understanding.
The approach of the PEARL project with regard to the transportability problem is to try and Identify areas of discourse that are common to most domains and to build robust modules for natural language analysis within these domains.
Examples of such domains are temporal reference, location reference, and report generation.
These modules are knowledge-based end can be used by a wide variety of domains to help extract the conceptual content of a request.
