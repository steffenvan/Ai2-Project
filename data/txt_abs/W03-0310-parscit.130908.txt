<newSection> Abstract We present two methods for the automatic creation of parallel corpora.
Whereas previous work into the automatic construction ofparallel corpora has focused on harvesting them from the web, we examine the use of existing parallel corpora to bootstrap data for new language pairs.
First, we extend existing parallel corpora using co-training, wherein machine translations are selectively added to training corpora with multiple source texts.
Retraining translation models yields modest improvements.
Second, we simulate the creation of training data for a language pair for which a parallel corpus is not available.
Starting with no human translations from German to English we produce a German to English translation model with 45% accuracy using parallel corpora in other languages.
This suggests the method may be useful in the creation of parallel corpora for languages with scarce resources.
