<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we propose the development of the Question-Answering Services System for the Farmer, through SMS, by focusing on query analysis and annotation based on a similar technique previously applied to language generation, thematic roles, and primitive systems of the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS).
The annotation places emphasis on the semantics model of “What” and “How” queries, lexical inference identification, and semantic role, for the answer.
Finally, we show how these annotations and inference rules contribute to the generalization of the matching system over semantic categories in order to have a large scale question-answering system.
