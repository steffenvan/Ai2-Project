<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a technique for word segmentation for the Urdu OCR system.
Word segmentation or word tokenization is a preliminary task for Urdu language processing.
Several techniques are available for word segmentation in other languages.
A methodology is proposed for word segmentation in this paper which determines the boundaries of words given a sequence of ligatures, based on collocation of ligatures and words in the corpus.
Using this technique, word identification rate of 96.10% is achieved, using trigram probabilities normalized over the number of ligatures and words in the sequence.
