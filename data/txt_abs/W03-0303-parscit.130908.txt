<newSection> Abstract In this paper, an improved word alignment based on bilingual bracketing is described.
The explored approaches include using Model-1 conditional probability, a boosting strategy for lexicon probabilities based on importance sampling, applying Parts of Speech to discriminate English words and incorporating information of English base noun phrase.
The results of the shared task on French-English, Romanian-English and Chinese-English word alignments are presented and discussed.
