<newSection> Abstract A flexible construction kit is presented compiling various forms of finite state replacement rules.
The approach is simpler and more declarative than algorithms in the tradition of Kaplan & Kay.
Simple constraints can be combined to achieve complex effects, including effects based on Optimality Theory.
