<newSection> Abstract This paper describes Stanford Universityâ€™s submission to SemEval 2012 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) shared evaluation task.
Our proposed metric computes probabilistic edit distance as predictions of semantic similarity.
We learn weighted edit distance in a probabilistic finite state machine (pFSM) model, where state transitions correspond to edit operations.
While standard edit distance models cannot capture long-distance word swapping or cross alignments, we rectify these shortcomings using a novel pushdown automaton extension of the pFSM model.
Our models are trained in a regression framework, and can easily incorporate a rich set of linguistic features.
The performance of our edit distance based models is contrasted with an adaptation of the Stanford textual entailment system to the STS task.
Our results show that the most advanced edit distance model, pPDA, outperforms our entailment system on all but one of the genres included in the STS task.
