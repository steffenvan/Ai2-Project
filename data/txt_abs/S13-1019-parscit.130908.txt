<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe KnCe2013-CORE, a system to compute the semantic similarity of two short text snippets.
The system computes a number of features which are gathered from different knowledge bases, namely WordNet, Wikipedia and Wiktionary.
The similarity scores derived from these features are then fed into several multilayer perceptron neuronal networks.
Depending on the size of the text snippets different parameters for the neural networks are used.
The final output of the neural networks is compared to human judged data.
In the evaluation our system performed sufficiently well for text snippets of equal length, but the performance dropped considerably once the pairs of text snippets differ in size.
