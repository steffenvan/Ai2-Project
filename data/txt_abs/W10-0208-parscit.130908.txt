<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present an evaluation of new techniques for automatically detecting emotions in text.
The study estimates categorical model and dimensional model for the recognition of four affective states: Anger, Fear, Joy, and Sadness that are common emotions in three datasets: SemEval-2007 “Affective Text”, ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions), and children’s fairy tales.
In the first model, WordNet-Affect is used as a linguistic lexical resource and three dimensionality reduction techniques are evaluated: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
In the second model, ANEW (Affective Norm for English Words), a normative database with affective terms, is employed.
Experiments show that a categorical model using NMF results in better performances for SemEval and fairy tales, whereas a dimensional model performs better with ISEAR.
