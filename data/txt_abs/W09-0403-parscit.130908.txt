<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a simple evaluation metric for MT which attempts to overcome the well-known deficits of the standard BLEU metric from a slightly different angle.
It employes Levenshteinâ€™s edit distance for establishing alignment between the MT output and the reference translation in order to reflect the morphological properties of highly inflected languages.
It also incorporates a very simple measure expressing the differences in the word order.
The paper also includes evaluation on the data from the previous SMT workshop for several language pairs.
