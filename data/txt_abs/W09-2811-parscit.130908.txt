<newSection> Abstract Users of Natural Language Generation systems are required to have sophisticated linguistic and sometimes even programming knowledge, which has hindered the adoption of this technology by individuals outside the computational linguistics research community.
We have designed and implemented a visual environment for creating and modifying NLG templates which requires no programming ability and minimum linguistic knowledge.
It allows specifying templates with any number of variables and dependencies between them.
Internally, it uses SimpleNLG to provide the linguistic background knowledge.
We tested the performance of our system in the context of an interactive simulation game.
We describe the templates used for testing and show examples of sentences that our system generates from these templates.
