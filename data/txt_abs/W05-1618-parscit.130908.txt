<newSection> Abstract Instructional texts consist of sequences of instructions designed in order to reach an objective.
The author or the generator of instructional texts must follow a number of principles to guarantee that the text is of any use.
Similarly, a user must follow step by step the instructions in order to reach the results expected.
In this paper, we explore facets of instructional texts: general prototypical structures, rhetorical structure and natural argumentation.
Our study is based on an extensive corpus study with the aim of generating such texts.
