<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a machine learning approach to classifying n-best speech recognition hypotheses as either correctly or incorrectly recognised.
The learners are trained on a combination of acoustic confidence features and move evaluation scores in a chess-playing scenario.
The results show significant improvements over sharp baselines that use confidence rejection thresholds for classification.
