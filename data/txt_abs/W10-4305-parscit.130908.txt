<newSection> Abstract Commonly used coreference resolution evaluation metrics can only be applied to key mentions, i.e. already annotated mentions.
We here propose two variants of the B3 and CEAF coreference resolution evaluation algorithms which can be applied to coreference resolution systems dealing with system mentions, i.e. automatically determined mentions.
Our experiments show that our variants lead to intuitive and reliable results.
