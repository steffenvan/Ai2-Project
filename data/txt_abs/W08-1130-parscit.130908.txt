<newSection> Abstract Selection of natural-sounding referring expressions is useful in text generation and information summarization (Kan et al., 2001).
We use discourse-level feature predicates in a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) with binary and n-class classification to select referring expressions from a list.
We find that while mention-type n-class classification produces higher accuracy of type, binary classification of individual referring expressions helps to avoid use of awkward referring expressions.
