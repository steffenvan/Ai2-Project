Abstract (2) a.
Er hat es nicht wahrhaben wollen he has it not accept to be true want Our paper aims at capturing the distribution of negative polarity items (NPIs) within lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG).
The condition under which an NPI can occur in a sentence is for it to be in the scope of a negation with no quantifiers scopally intervening.
We model this restriction within a recent framework for LTAG semantics based on semantic unification.
The proposed analysis provides features that signal the presence of a negation in the semantics and that specify its scope.
We extend our analysis to modelling the interaction of NPI licensing and neg raising constructions.
