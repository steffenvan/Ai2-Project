<newSection> Abstract In this pilot study we define and apply a methodology for building an event extraction system for the Swedish scientific medical and clinical language.
Our aim is to find and describe linguistic expressions which refer to medical events, such as events related to diseases, symptoms and drug effects.
In order to achieve this goal we have initiated actions that aim to extend and refine parts of the ongoing compilation of the Swedish FrameNet++ (SFN++).
SFN++, as its English original predecessor, is grounded in Frame Semantics which provides a sound theoretical ground for modeling and linking linguistic structures encountered in general language and in specific domains (after specialization).
Using such resource we have started to manually annotate domain texts for enriching SFN++ with authentic samples and for providing training data for automated event extraction techniques.
