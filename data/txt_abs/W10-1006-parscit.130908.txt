<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present results from two pilot studies which show that using the Amazon Mechanical Turk for preposition error annotation is as effective as using trained raters, but at a fraction of the time and cost.
Based on these results, we propose a new evaluation method which makes it feasible to compare two error detection systems tested on different learner data sets.
