<newSection> Abstract We describe our systems for the SemEval 2014 Task 5: L2 writing assistant where a system has to find appropriate translations of L1 segments in a given L2 context.
We participated in three out of four possible language pairs (English-Spanish, FrenchEnglish and Dutch-English) and achieved the best performance for all our submitted systems according to word-based accuracy.
Our models are based on phrase-based machine translation systems and combine topical context information and language model scoring.
