<newSection> Abstract This paper reports an investigation of the turn-taking functions of drawings in graphical communication.
Based on the examination of dialogue data collected that involve collaborative drawing interactions, as well as spoken dialogue interactions, in a joint problem solving task, we found that ‘drawing turns,’ in which the drawer presents a piece of information to her partner through drawing, had almost the same turn-keeping effects as ‘speech turns.’
