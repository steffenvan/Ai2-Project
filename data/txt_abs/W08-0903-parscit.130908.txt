<newSection> Abstract King Alfred is the name of both an innovative textbook and a computational environment deployed in parallel in an undergraduate course on Anglo-Saxon literature.
This paper details the ways in which it brings dynamically-generated resources to the aid of the language student.
We store the feature-rich grammar of Anglo-Saxon in a bi-level glossary, provide an annotation context for use during the translation task, and are currently working toward the implementation of automatic evaluation of student-generated translations.
