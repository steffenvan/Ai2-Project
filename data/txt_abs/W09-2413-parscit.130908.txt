<newSection> Abstract We propose a multilingual unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task for a sample of English nouns.
Instead of providing manually sense-tagged examples for each sense of a polysemous noun, our sense inventory is built up on the basis of the Europarl parallel corpus.
The multilingual setup involves the translations of a given English polysemous noun in five supported languages, viz.
Dutch, French, German, Spanish and Italian.
The task targets the following goals: (a) the manual creation of a multilingual sense inventory for a lexical sample of English nouns and (b) the evaluation of systems on their ability to disambiguate new occurrences of the selected polysemous nouns.
For the creation of the hand-tagged gold standard, all translations of a given polysemous English noun are retrieved in the five languages and clustered by meaning.
Systems can participate in 5 bilingual evaluation subtasks (English - Dutch, English - German, etc.) and in a multilingual subtask covering all language pairs.
As WSD from cross-lingual evidence is gaining popularity, we believe it is important to create a multilingual gold standard and run cross-lingual WSD benchmark tests.
