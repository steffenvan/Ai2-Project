<newSection> Abstract Interactive fiction (often called “IF”) is a venerable thread of creative computing that includes Adventure, Zork, and the computer game The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy as well as innovative recent work.
These programs are usually known as “games,” appropriately, but they can also be rich forms of text-based computer simulation, dialog systems, and examples of computational literary art.
Theorists of narrative have long distinguished between the level of underlying content or story (which can usefully be seen as corresponding to the simulated world in interactive fiction) and that of expression or discourse (corresponding to the textual exchange between computer and user).
While IF development systems have offered a great deal of power and flexibility to author/programmers by providing a computational model of the fictional world, previous systems have not systematically distinguished between the telling and what is told.
Developers were not able to control the content and expression levels independently so that they could, for instance, have a program relate events out of chronological order or have it relate events from the perspective of different characters.
Curveship is an interactive fiction system which draws on narrative theory and computational linguistics to allow the transformation of the narrating in these ways.
This talk will briefly describe interactive fiction, narrative variation, and how Curveship provides new capabilities for interactive fiction authors.
author’s dissertation (Montfort 2007b).
While the interface to the system has been streamlined and other changes are being made to facilitate the use of Curveship by interactive fiction authors, the approach to narrative variation that is described there remains current.
