<newSection> Abstract This paper addresses two major problems in closed task of Chinese word segmentation (CWS): tagging sentences interspersed with non-Chinese words, and long named entity (NE) identification.
To resolve the former, we apply Kmeans clustering to identify non-Chinese characters, and then adopt a two-tagger architecture: one for Chinese text and the other for non-Chinese text.
For the latter problem, we apply postprocessing to our CWS output using automatically generated templates.
The experiment results show that, when non-Chinese characters are sparse in the training corpus, our two-tagger method significantly improves the segmentation of sentences containing non-Chinese words.
Identification of long NEs and long words is also enhanced by template-based postprocessing.
In the closed task of SIGHAN 2006 CWS, our system achieved F-scores of 0.957, 0.972, and 0.955 on the CKIP, CTU, and MSR corpora respectively.
