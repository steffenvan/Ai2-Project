<newSection> Abstract We present an Earley-style parser for simple range concatenation grammar, a formalism strongly equivalent to linear context-free rewriting systems.
Furthermore, we present different filters which reduce the number of items in the parsing chart.
An implementation shows that parses can be obtained in a reasonable time.
