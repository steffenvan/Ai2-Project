<newSection> Abstract A chatbot is a software system, which can interact or “chat” with a human user in natural language such as English.
For the annual Loebner Prize contest, rival chatbots have been assessed in terms of ability to fool a judge in a restricted chat session.
We are investigating methods to train and adapt a chatbot to a specific user’s language use or application, via a user-supplied training corpus.
We advocate open-ended trials by real users, such as an example Afrikaans chatbot for Afrikaans-speaking researchers and students in South Africa.
This is evaluated in terms of “glass box” dialogue efficiency metrics, and “black box” dialogue quality metrics and user satisfaction feedback.
The other examples presented in this paper are the Qur'an and the FAQchat prototypes.
Our general conclusion is that evaluation should be adapted to the application and to user needs.
