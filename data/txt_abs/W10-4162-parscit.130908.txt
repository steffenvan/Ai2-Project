<newSection> Abstract The more Chinese language materials come out, the more we have to focus on the “same personal name” problem.
In our personal name disambiguation system, the hierarchical agglomerative clustering is applied, and named entity is used as feature for document similarity calculation.
We propose a two-stage strategy in which the first stage involves word segmentation and named entity recognition (NER) for feature extraction, and the second stage focuses on clustering.
