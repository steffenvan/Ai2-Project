<newSection> Abstract Mikrokosmos contains an ontology plus a number of lexicons in different languages that were originally developed for machine translation.
The underlying representation formalism for these resources is an ad-hoc frame-based language which makes it difficult to inter-operate Mikrokosmos with state-ofthe-art knowledge-based systems.
In this paper we propose a translation from the frame-based representation of Mikrokosmos into Description logics.
This translation allows us to automatically transform Mikrokosmos sources into OWL and thus provide a powerful ontology in the formalism of the semantic web.
Furthermore, the reasoning mechanisms of Description Logics may also support knowledge acquisition and maintenance as well as its application in natural language processing systems.
