<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the development of a statistical machine translation system based on the Moses decoder for the 2007 WMT shared tasks.
Several different translation strategies were explored.
We also use a statistical language model that is based on a continuous representation of the words in the vocabulary.
By these means we expect to take better advantage of the limited amount of training data.
Finally, we have investigated the usefulness of a second reference translation of the development data.
