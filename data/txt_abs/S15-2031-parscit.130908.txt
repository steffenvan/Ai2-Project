<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our Align-andDifferentiate approach to the SemEval 2015 Task 2 competition for English Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) systems.
Our submission achieved the top place on two of the five evaluation datasets.
Our team placed 3rd among 28 participating teams, and our three runs ranked 4th, 6th and 7th among the 73 runs submitted by the 28 teams.
Our approach improves upon the UMBC PairingWords system by semantically differentiating distributionally similar terms.
This novel addition improves results by 2.5 points on the Pearson correlation measure.
