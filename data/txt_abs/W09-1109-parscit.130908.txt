<newSection> Abstract Vector space models of word meaning typically represent the meaning of a word as a vector computed by summing over all its corpus occurrences.
Words close to this point in space can be assumed to be similar to it in meaning.
But how far around this point does the region of similar meaning extend?
In this paper we discuss two models that represent word meaning as regions in vector space.
Both representations can be computed from traditional point representations in vector space.
We find that both models perform at over 95% F-score on a token classification task.
