<newSection> Abstract We present a new translation model that include undecorated hierarchical-style phrase rules, decorated source-syntax rules, and partially decorated rules.
Results show an increase in translation performance of up to 0.8% BLEU for Germanâ€“English translation when trained on the news-commentary corpus, using syntactic annotation from a source language parser.
We also experimented with annotation from shallow taggers and found this increased performance by 0.5% BLEU.
