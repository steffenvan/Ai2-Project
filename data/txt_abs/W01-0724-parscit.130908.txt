<newSection> 1 Introduction We apply a memory-based learner to the CoNLL-2001 shared task: clause identification (Tjong Kim Sang and Dejean, 2001).
The task is divided in three parts.
The first two parts are classification tasks: identifying the positions of clause starts and clause ends given a word, its part-of-speech tag and the syntactic base chunk it belongs to.
Our memory-based learner can be applied to these tasks in a straightforward way.
The third part of the shared task is identifying complete embedded clauses.
We will perform this task by first identifying clause starts and clause ends and then combining these to clauses with a set of conversion rules.
