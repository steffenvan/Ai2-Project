<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe the statistical machine translation system of the RWTH Aachen University developed for the translation task of the Fifth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.
State-of-the-art phrase-based and hierarchical statistical MT systems are augmented with appropriate morpho-syntactic enhancements, as well as alternative phrase training methods and extended lexicon models.
For some tasks, a system combination of the best systems was used to generate a final hypothesis.
We participated in the constrained condition of German-English and French-English in each translation direction.
