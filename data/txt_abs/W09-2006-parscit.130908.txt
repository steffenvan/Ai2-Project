<newSection> Abstract This paper presents our on-going work to automatically generate lyrics for a given melody, for phonetic languages such as Tamil.
We approach the task of identifying the required syllable pattern for the lyric as a sequence labeling problem and hence use the popular CRF++ toolkit for learning.
A corpus comprising of 10 melodies was used to train the system to understand the syllable patterns.
The trained model is then used to guess the syllabic pattern for a new melody to produce an optimal sequence of syllables.
This sequence is presented to the Sentence Generation module which uses the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to come up with a meaningful phrase matching the syllabic pattern.
