<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a system capable of semi-automatically filling an XML template from free texts in the clinical domain (practice guidelines).
The XML template includes semantic information not explicitly encoded in the text (pairs of conditions and actions/recommendations).
Therefore, there is a need to compute the exact scope of conditions over text sequences expressing the required actions.
We present a system developed for this task.
We show that it yields good performance when applied to the analysis of French practice guidelines.
