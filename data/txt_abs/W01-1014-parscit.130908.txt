<newSection> Abstract In interpreting multilingual queries to databases whose domain information is described in a particular language, we must address the problem of word sense disambiguation.
Since full-fledged semantic classification information is difficult to construct either automatically or manually for this purpose, we propose to disambiguate the senses of the source lexical items by automatically augmenting a simple translation dictionary with database terminologies and describe an implemented multilingual query interpretation system in a combinatory categorial grammar framework.1
