<newSection> Abstract We consider in depth the semantic analysis in learning systems as well as some information retrieval techniques applied for measuring the document similarity in eLearning.
These results are obtained in a CALL project, which ended by extensive user evaluation.
After several years spent in the development of CALL modules and prototypes, we think that much closer cooperation with real teaching experts is necessary, to find the proper learning niches and suitable wrappings of the language technologies, which could give birth to useful eLearning solutions.
