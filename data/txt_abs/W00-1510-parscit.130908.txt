<newSection> Abstract Speech dialogue systems are currently becoming state—of—the—art for different kinds of applications, but they are still weak in the support of spontaneous speech and correct interpretation of what was said.
One reason for the lack of good interactive dialogue systems is their complexity.
To develop a system which is able to handle more than simple commands and phrases requires a lot of experience and time.
To be able to accelerate and improve this process we are currently working on methods and tools which support this development.
A new method called Dialogue Statecharts was defined for the graphical specification of complex dialogues.
It is capable of representing parallel dialogue steps which is e.g. necessary for mixed— initiative dialogues.
Our tool system named Diamod provides editors for different dialogue concepts, such as dialogue structures, grammars and parameters.
The modeling is supported by graphical editors for Dialogue Statecharts and Task Hierarchies.
Diamod is able to check for the completeness and consistency of dialogue models.
One goal when developing Di-amod was to provide specification models which are universal enough to be interpreted within different dialogue systems, i.e. different implementations of generic conversational systems.'
With the help of a uniform representation of data a transformation between different models and different dialogue description languages (DDL) such as VoiceXML (AT&T et al., 2000) and some in—house—DDLs, such as Temic—DDL and Dialogue-Prolog, will be possible.
1-By this we mean systems which are implemented application independently and are easily adapted to different applications.
