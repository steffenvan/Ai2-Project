<newSection> Abstract We present an annotation scheme for the annotation of complex predicates, understood as constructions with more than one lexical unit, each contributing part of the information normally associated with a single predicate.
We discuss our annotation guidelines of four types of complex predicates, and the treatment of several difficult cases, related to ambiguity, overlap and coordination.
We then discuss the process of marking up the Portuguese CINTIL corpus of 1M tokens (written and spoken) with a new layer of information regarding complex predicates.
We also present the outcomes of the annotation work and statistics on the types of CPs that we found in the corpus.
