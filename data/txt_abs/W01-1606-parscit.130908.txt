<newSection> Abstract The development of spoken dialogue systems is often limited by the performance of their speech recognition component.
The impact of speech recognition errors on dialogue systems is often studied at the global level of task completion.
In this paper, we carry an empirical study on the consequences of speech recognition errors on a fully-implemented dialogue prototype, based on a speech acts formalisms.
We report the impact of speech recognition errors on speech act identification and discuss how standard control mechanisms can participate to robustness by assisting the user in repairing the consequences of speech recognition errors.
