<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a novel undertaking: comparing the relationship between grammatical ambiguity (syncretism) in nouns, as represented in a default inheritance hierarchy, with textual frequency distributions.
In order to do this we consider a language with a reasonable number of grammatical distinctions and where syncretism occurs in different morphological classes.
We investigated this relationship for Russian nouns.
Our results suggest that there is an intricate relationship between textual frequency and inflectional syncretism.
