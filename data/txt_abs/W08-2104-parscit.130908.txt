<newSection> Abstract This article investigates the effect of a set of linguistically motivated features on argument disambiguation in data-driven dependency parsing of Swedish.
We present results from experiments with gold standard features, such as animacy, definiteness and finiteness, as well as corresponding experiments where these features have been acquired automatically and show significant improvements both in overall parse results and in the analysis of specific argument relations, such as subjects, objects and predicatives.
