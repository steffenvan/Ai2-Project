<newSection> Abstract This paper describes an experimental integration of two infrastructures (Eudico and GATE) which were developed independently of each other; for different media (video/speech vs. text) and applications.
The integration resulted into gaining an in-depth understanding of the functionality and operation of each of the two systems in isolation, and the benefits of their combined use.
It also highlighted some issues (e.g., distributed access) which need to be addressed in future work.
The experiment also showed clearly the advantages of modularity and generality adopted in both systems.
