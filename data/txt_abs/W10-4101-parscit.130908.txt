<newSection> Abstract The authors propose that we need some change for the current technology in Chinese word segmentation.
We should have separate and different phases in the so-called segmentation.
First of all, we need to limit segmentation only to the segmentation of Chinese characters instead of the so-called Chinese words.
In character segmentation, we will extract all the information of each character.
Then we start a phase called Chinese morphological processing (CMP).
The first step of CMP is to do a combination of the separate characters and is then followed by post-segmentation processing, including all sorts of repetitive structures, Chinese-style abbreviations, recognition of pseudo-OOVs and their processing, etc.
The most part of post-segmentation processing may have to be done by some rule-based sub-routines, thus we need change the current corpus-based methodology by merging with rule-based technique.
