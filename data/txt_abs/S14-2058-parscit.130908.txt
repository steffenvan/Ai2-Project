<newSection> Abstract This work analyses various syntactic and lexical features for sentence level aspect based sentiment analysis.
The task focuses on detection of a writerâ€™s sentiment towards an aspect which is explicitly mentioned in a sentence.
The target sentiment polarities are positive, negative, conflict and neutral.
We use a supervised learning approach, evaluate various features and report accuracies which are much higher than the provided baselines.
Best features include unigrams, clauses, dependency relations and SentiWordNet polarity scores.
