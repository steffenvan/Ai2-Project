<newSection> Abstract Regression testing of natural language systems is problematic for two main reasons: component input and output is complex, and system behaviour is context-dependent.
We have developed a generic approach which solves both of these issues.
We describe our regression tool, CONTEST, which supports context-dependent testing of dialogue system components, and discuss the regression test sets we developed, designed to effectively isolate components from changes and problems earlier in the pipeline.
We believe that the same approach can be used in regression testing for other dialogue systems, as well as in testing any complex NLP system containing multiple components.
