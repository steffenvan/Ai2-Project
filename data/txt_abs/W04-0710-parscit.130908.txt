<newSection> Abstract This article studies the resolution of references made by speakers to documents discussed during a meeting.
The focus is on transcribed recordings of press review meetings, in French.
After an overview of the required framework for reference resolution—specification of the task, data annotation, and evaluation procedure—we propose, analyze and evaluate an algorithm for the resolution of references to documents (ref2doc) based on anaphora tracking and context matching.
Applications to speech-to-document alignment and more generally to meeting processing and retrieval are finally discussed.
