<newSection> 1 Grammatical inference and its links to natural language processing When dealing with language, (machine) learning can take many different faces, of which the most important are those concerned with learning languages and grammars from data.
Questions in this context have been at the intersection of the fields of inductive inference and computational linguistics for the past fifty years.
To go back to the pioneering work, Chomsky (1955; 1957) and Solomonoff (1960; 1964) were interested, for very different reasons, in systems or programs that could deduce a language when presented information about it.
Gold (1967; 1978) proposed a little later a unifying paradigm called identification in the limit, and the term of grammatical inference seems to have appeared in Horning’s PhD thesis (1969).
Out of the scope of linguistics, researchers and engineers dealing with pattern recognition, under the impulsion of Fu (1974; 1975), invented algorithms and studied subclasses of languages and grammars from the point of view of what could or could not be learned.
Researchers in machine learning tackled related problems (the most famous being that of inferring a deterministic finite automaton, given examples and counter-examples of strings).
Angluin (1978; 1980; 1981; 1982; 1987) introduced the important setting of active learning, or learning for queries, whereas Pitt and his colleagues (1988; 1989; 1993) gave several complexity inspired results with which the hardness of the different learning problems was exposed.
Researchers working in more applied areas, such as computational biology, also deal with strings.
A number of researchers from that field worked on learning grammars or automata from string data (Brazma and Cerans, 1994; Brazma, 1997; Brazma et al., 1998).
Similarly, stemming from computational linguistics, one can point out the work relating language learning with more complex grammatical formalisms (Kanazawa, 1998), the more statistical approaches based on building language models (Goodman, 2001), or the different systems introduced to automatically build grammars from sentences (van Zaanen, 2000; Adriaans and Vervoort, 2002).
Surveys of related work in specific fields can also be found (Natarajan, 1991; Kearns and Vazirani, 1994; Sakakibara, 1997; Adriaans and van Zaanen, 2004; de la Higuera, 2005; Wolf, 2006).
2 Meeting points between grammatical inference and natural language processing Grammatical inference scientists belong to a number of larger communities: machine learning (with special emphasis on inductive inference), computational linguistics, pattern recognition (within the structural and syntactic sub-group).
There is a specific conference called ICGI (International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference) devoted to the subject.
These conferences have been held at Alicante (Carrasco and Oncina, 1994), Mont-pellier (Miclet and de la Higuera, 1996), Ames (Honavar and Slutski, 1998), Lisbon (de Oliveira, 2000), Amsterdam (Adriaans et al., 2002), Athens (Paliouras and Sakakibara, 2004), Tokyo (Sakak-ibara et al., 2006) and Saint-Malo (Clark et al., 2008).
In the proceedings of this event it is possible to find a number of technical papers.
Within this context, there has been a growing trend towards problems of language learning in the field of computational linguistics.
The formal objects in common between the two communities are the different types of automata and grammars.
Therefore, another meeting point between these communities has been the different workshops, conferences and journals that focus on grammars and automata, for instance, Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Workshop on Computational Linguistic Aspects of Grammatical Inference, pages 1–4, Athens, Greece, 30 March 2009.
