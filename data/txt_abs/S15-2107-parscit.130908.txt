<newSection> Abstract This paper describes TwitterHawk, a system for sentiment analysis of tweets which participated in the SemEval-2015 Task 10, Subtasks A through D.
The system performed competitively, most notably placing 1s1 in topic-based sentiment classification (Subtask C) and ranking 41h out of 40 in identifying the sentiment of sarcastic tweets.
Our submissions in all four subtasks used a supervised learning approach to perform three-way classification to assign positive, negative, or neutral labels.
Our system development efforts focused on text pre-processing and feature engineering, with a particular focus on handling negation, integrating sentiment lexicons, parsing hashtags, and handling expressive word modifications and emoticons.
Two separate classifiers were developed for phrase-level and tweet-level sentiment classification.
Our success in aforementioned tasks came in part from leveraging the Subtask B data and building a single tweet-level classifier for Subtasks B, C and D.
