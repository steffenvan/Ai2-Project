<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we give an overview of our participation in the timeline generation task of SemEval-2015 (task 4, TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering).
The main goals of this new track are, given a collection of news articles and a so-called target entity, to determine events that are relevant for the entity, to resolve event coreferences, and to order the events chronologically.
We addressed the sub-tasks, in which event mentions were provided, i.e., no additional event extraction was required.
For this, we developed an ad-hoc approach based on a temporal tagger and a coreference resolution tool for entities.
After determining relevant sentences, relevant events are extracted and anchored on a timeline.
The evaluation conducted on three collections of news articles shows that our approach – despite its simplicity – achieves reasonable results and opens several promising issues for future work.
