<newSection> Abstract We describe a method of text summarization that produces indicative-informative abstracts for technical papers.
The abstracts are generated by a process of conceptual identification, topic extraction and re-generation.
We have carried out an evaluation to assess indicativeness and text acceptability relying on human judgment.
The results so far indicate good performance in both tasks when compared with other summarization technologies.
