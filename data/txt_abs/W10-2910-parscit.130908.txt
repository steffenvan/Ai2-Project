<newSection> Abstract We demonstrate that relational features derived from dependency-syntactic and semantic role structures are useful for the task of detecting opinionated expressions in natural-language text, significantly improving over conventional models based on sequence labeling with local features.
These features allow us to model the way opinionated expressions interact in a sentence over arbitrary distances.
While the relational features make the prediction task more computationally expensive, we show that it can be tackled effectively by using a reranker.
We evaluate a number of machine learning approaches for the reranker, and the best model results in a 10-point absolute improvement in soft recall on the MPQA corpus, while decreasing precision only slightly.
