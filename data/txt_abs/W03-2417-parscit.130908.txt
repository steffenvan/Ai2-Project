<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present a novel approach for building parallel syntactically annotated sentences for different frameworks and languages.
These syntactically annotated sentences are automatically generated from a compact higher level of syntactic abstraction, a MetaGrammar hierarchy, which minimizes the need for human intervention in building annotated test-suites.
With a single hierarchy, each sentence generated is automatically mapped to several annotations (traditional constituent structure, LFG F-structure, dependency structure and constraint grammar representation) thus allowing one to directly compare the coverage of grammars based on different frameworks.
Furthermore, also with that same single compact hierarchy, the tool generates parallel annotated sentences for different languages, which may prove useful for Machine Translation evaluation.
