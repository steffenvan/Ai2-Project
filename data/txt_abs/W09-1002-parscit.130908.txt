<newSection> Abstract We discuss a cue-based grammar induction approach based on a parallel theory of grammar.
Our model is based on the hypotheses of interdependency between linguistic levels (of representation) and in-ductability of specific structural properties at a particular level, with consequences for the induction of structural properties at other linguistic levels.
We present the results of three different cue-learning experiments and settings, covering the induction of phonological, morphological, and syntactic properties, and discuss potential consequences for our general grammar induction model.1
