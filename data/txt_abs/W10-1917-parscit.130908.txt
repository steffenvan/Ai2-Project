<newSection> 1 Introduction NLP methods for extracting mutation information from the bibliome have become an important new research area within bio-NLP, as manually curated databases, like the Protein Mutant Database (PMD) (Kawabata et al., 1999), cannot keep up with the rapid pace of mutation research.
However, while significant progress has been made with respect to mutation detection, the automated extraction of the impacts of these mutations has so far not been targeted.
In this paper, we describe the first work to automatically summarize impact information from protein mutations.
Our approach is based on populating an OWL-DL ontology with impact information, which can then be queried to provide structured information, including a summary.
