<newSection> Abstract We introduce a multi-language named-entity recognition system based on HMM.
Japanese, Chinese, Korean and English versions have already been implemented.
In principle, it can analyze any other language if we have training data of the target language.
This system has a common analytical engine and it can handle any language simply by changing the lexical analysis rules and statistical language model.
In this paper, we describe the architecture and accuracy of the named-entity system, and report preliminary experiments on automatic bilingual named-entity dictionary construction using the Japanese and English named-entity recognizer.
