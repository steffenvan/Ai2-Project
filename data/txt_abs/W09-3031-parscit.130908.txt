<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present preliminary work on corpus-based anaphora resolution of discourse deixis in German.
Our annotation guidelines provide linguistic tests for locating the antecedent, and for determining the semantic types of both the antecedent and the anaphor.
The corpus consists of selected speaker turns from the Europarl corpus.
