<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a transliteration system based on pair Hidden Markov Model (pair HMM) training and Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) techniques.
Parameters used by WFSTs for transliteration generation are learned from a pair HMM.
Parameters from pair-HMM training on English-Russian data sets are found to give better transliteration quality than parameters trained for WFSTs for corresponding structures.
Training a pair HMM on English vowel bigrams and standard bigrams for Cyrillic Romanization, and using a few transformation rules on generated Russian transliterations to test for context improves the systemâ€™s transliteration quality.
