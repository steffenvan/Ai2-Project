<newSection> Abstract This paper proposes an easy and simple method for constructing a super-structure on the Web which provides current Web contents with new value and new means of use.
The super-structure is based on external annotations to Web documents.
We have developed a system for any user to annotate any element of any Web document with additional information.
We have also developed a proxy that transcodes requested contents by considering annotations assigned to them.
In this paper, we classify annotations into three categories.
One is linguistic annotation which helps the transcoder understand the semantic structure of textual elements.
The second is commentary annotation which helps the transcoder manipulate non-textual elements such as images and sounds.
The third is multimedia annotation, which is a combination of the above two types.
All types of annotation are described using XML, and correspondence between annotations and document elements is defined using URLs and XPaths.
We call the entire process “semantic transcoding” because we deal with the deep semantic content of documents with annotations.
The current semantic transcoding process mainly handles text and video summarization, language translation, and speech synthesis of documents including images.
