<newSection> Abstract In a real-world setting, questions are not asked in isolation, but rather in a cohesive manner that involves a sequence of related questions to meet userâ€™s information needs.
The capability to interpret and answer questions based on context is important.
In this paper, we discuss the role of discourse modeling in context question answering.
In particular, we motivate a semantic-rich discourse representation and discuss the impact of refined discourse structure on question answering.
