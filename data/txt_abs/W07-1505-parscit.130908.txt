<newSection> Abstract We introduce an annotation type system for a data-driven NLP core system.
The specifications cover formal document structure and document meta information, as well as the linguistic levels of morphology, syntax and semantics.
The type system is embedded in the framework of the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA).
