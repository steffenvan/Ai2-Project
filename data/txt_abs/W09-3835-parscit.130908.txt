<newSection> Abstract This paper introduces a formal framework that presents a novel Interactive Predictive Parsing schema which can be operated by a user, tightly integrated into the system, to obtain error free trees.
This compares to the classical two-step schema of manually post-editing the erroneus constituents produced by the parsing system.
We have simulated interaction and calculated evalaution metrics, which established that an IPP system results in a high amount of effort reduction for a manual annotator compared to a two-step system.
