<newSection> 1 Introduction Manipuri has little resource for NLP related research and development activities.
Manipuri is a less privileged Tibeto-Burman language spoken by approximately three million people mainly in the state of Manipur in India as well as its neighboring states and in the countries of Myanmar and Bangladesh.
Some of the unique features of this language are tone, the agglutinative verb morphology and predominance of aspect than tense, lack of grammatical gender, number and person.
Other features are verb final word order in a sentence i.e., Subject Object Verb (SOV) order, extensive suffix with more limited prefixation.
In Manipuri, identification of most of the word classes and sentence types are based on the markers.
All sentences, except interrogatives end with one of these mood markers, which may or may not be followed by an enclitic.
Basic sentence types in Manipuri are determined through illocutionary mood markers, all of which are verbal inflectional suffixes, with the exception of the interrogatives that end with an enclitic.
Two important problems in applying statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques to English-Manipuri bidirectional MT systems are: (a) the wide syntactic divergence between the language pairs, and (b) the richer morphology and case marking of Manipuri compared to English.
The first problem manifests itself in poor word-order in the output translations, while the second one leads to incorrect inflections and case marking.
The output Manipuri sentences in case of English-Manipuri system suffer badly when morphology and case markers are incorrect in this free word order and morphologically rich language.
