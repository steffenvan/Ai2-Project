<newSection> 0.0 INTRODUCTION The primary task of semantic processing is to provide an appropriate mapping between the syntactic constituents of a parsed sentence and the arguments of the semantic predicates implied by the verb.
This is known as the Alignment Problem.
(Levin) Section One of this paper gives an overview of a generally accepted approach to semantic processing that goes through several levels of representation to achieve this mapping.
Although somewhat inflexible and cumbersome, the different levels succeed in preserving the context sensitive information provided by verb semantics.
Section Two presents the author's rule-driven approach which is more uniform and flexible yet still accommodates context sensitive constraints.
This approach is based on general underlying principles for syntactic methods of introducing semantic arguments and has interesting implications for linguistic theories about case.
These implications are dicussed in Section Three.
A system that implements this approach has been designed for and tested on pulley problem statements gathered from several physics text books.
