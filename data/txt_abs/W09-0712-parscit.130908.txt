<newSection> Abstract We present the Tamajaq language and the dictionary we used as main linguistic resource in the two first parts.
The third part details the complex morphology of this language.
In the part 4 we describe the conversion of the dictionary into electronic form, the inflectional rules we wrote and their implementation in the Nooj software.
Finally we present a plan for our future work.
