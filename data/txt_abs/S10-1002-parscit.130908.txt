<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe the SemEval2010 Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution task, where given an English target word in context, participating systems had to find an alternative substitute word or phrase in Spanish.
The task is based on the English Lexical Substitution task run at SemEval-2007.
In this paper we provide background and motivation for the task, we describe the data annotation process and the scoring system, and present the results of the participating systems.
