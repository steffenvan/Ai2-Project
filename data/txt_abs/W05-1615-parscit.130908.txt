<newSection> Abstract Post-editing is commonly performed on computer-generated texts, whether from Machine Translation (MT) or NLG systems, to make the texts acceptable to end users.
MT systems are often evaluated using post-edit data.
In this paper we describe our experience of using post-edit data to evaluate SUMTIME-MOUSAM, an NLG system that produces marine weather forecasts.
