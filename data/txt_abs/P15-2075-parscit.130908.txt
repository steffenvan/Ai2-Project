<newSection> Abstract We propose two improvements on lexical association used in embedding learning: factorizing individual dependency relations and using lexicographic knowledge from monolingual dictionaries.
Both proposals provide low-entropy lexical cooccurrence information, and are empirically shown to improve embedding learning by performing notably better than several popular embedding models in similarity tasks.
