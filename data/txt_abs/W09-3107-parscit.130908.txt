<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a new task to extract and align information networks from comparable corpora.
As a case study we demonstrate the effectiveness of this task on automatically mining name translation pairs.
Starting from a small set of seeds, we design a novel approach to acquire name translation pairs in a bootstrapping framework.
The experimental results show this approach can generate highly accurate name translation pairs for persons, geopolitical and organization entities.
