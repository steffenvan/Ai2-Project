<newSection> Abstract We discuss results on the shared task of Romanian-English word alignment.
The baseline technique is that of symmetrizing two word alignments automatically generated using IBM Model 4.
A simple vocabulary reduction technique results in an improvement in performance.
We also report on a new alignment model and a new training algorithm based on alternating maximization of likelihood with minimization of error rate.
