<newSection> Abstract We present in this paper a parser relying on a constraint-based formalism called Property Grammar.
We show how constraints constitute an efficient solution in parsing non canonical material such as spoken language transcription or e-mails.
This technique, provided that it is implemented with some control mechanisms, is very efficient.
Some results are presented, from the French parsing evaluation campaign EASy.
