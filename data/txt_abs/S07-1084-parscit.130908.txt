<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a method for automatic classification of semantic relations between nominals using Sequential Minimal Optimization.
We participated in the four categories of SEMEVAL task 4 (A: No Query, No Wordnet; B: WordNet, No Query; C: Query, No WordNet; D: WordNet and Query) and for all training datasets.
Best scores were achieved in category B using a set of feature vectors including lexical file numbers of nominals obtained from WordNet and a new feature WordNet Vector designed for the task1.
