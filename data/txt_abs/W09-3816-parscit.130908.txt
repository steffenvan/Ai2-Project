<newSection> Abstract We present an asymmetric approach to a run-time combination of two parsers where one component serves as a predictor to the other one.
Predictions are integrated by means of weighted constraints and therefore are subject to preferential decisions.
Previously, the same architecture has been successfully used with predictors providing partial or inferior information about the parsing problem.
It has now been applied to a situation where the predictor produces exactly the same type of information at a fully competitive quality level.
Results show that the combined system outperforms its individual components, even though their performance in isolation is already fairly high.
