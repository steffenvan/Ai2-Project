<newSection> Abstract We describe our approach for the SemEval-2014 task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.
We make use of an ensemble learning method for sentiment classification of tweets that relies on varied features such as feature hashing, part-of-speech, and lexical features.
Our system was evaluated in the Twitter message-level task.
