<newSection> Abstract We describe a system, UNN-WePS for identifying individuals from web pages using data from Semeval Task 13.
Our system is based on using co-presence of person names to form seed clusters.
These are then extended with pages that are deemed conceptually similar based on a lexical chaining analysis computed using Rogetâ€™s thesaurus.
Finally, a single link hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm merges the enhanced clusters for individual entity recognition.
UNN-WePS achieved an average purity of 0.6, and inverse purity of 0.73.
