<newSection> Abstract We propose a fast and reliable Question-answering (QA) system in Korean, which uses a predictive answer indexer based on 2-pass scoring method.
The indexing process is as follows.
The predictive answer indexer first extracts all answer candidates in a document.
Then, using 2-pass scoring method, it gives scores to the adjacent content words that are closely related with each answer candidate.
Next, it stores the weighted content words with each candidate into a database.
Using this technique, along with a complementary analysis of questions, the proposed QA system saves response time and enhances the precision.
