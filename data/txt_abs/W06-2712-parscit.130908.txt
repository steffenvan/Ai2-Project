<newSection> 1 Introduction MMAX21 is a versatile, XML-based annotation tool which has already been used in a variety of annotation projects.
It is also the tool of choice in the ongoing project DIANA-Summ, which deals with anaphora resolution and its application to spoken dialog summarization.
The project uses the ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003), a corpus of multi-party dialogs which contains a considerable amount of simultaneous speech.
It features a semiautomatically generated segmentation in which the corpus developers tried to track the flow of the dialog by inserting segment starts approximately whenever a person started talking.
As a result, the corpus has some interesting structural properties, most notably overlap, that are challenging for an XML-based representation format.
The following brief overview of MMAX2 focuses on this aspect, using examples from the ICSI Meeting Corpus.
