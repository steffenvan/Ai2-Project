<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a first attempt of an application-driven evaluation exercise of WSD.
We used a CLIR testbed from the Cross Lingual Evaluation Forum.
The expansion, indexing and retrieval strategies where fixed by the organizers.
The participants had to return both the topics and documents tagged with WordNet 1.6 word senses.
The organization provided training data in the form of a pre-processed Semcor which could be readily used by participants.
The task had two participants, and the organizer also provide an in-house WSD system for comparison.
