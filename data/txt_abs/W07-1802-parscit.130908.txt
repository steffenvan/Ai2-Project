<newSection> Abstract We present an algorithm for converting Grammatical Framework grammars (Ranta, 2004) into the Regulus unification-based framework (Rayner et al., 2006).
The main purpose is to take advantage of the Regulus-to-Nuance compiler for generating optimized speech recognition grammars.
But there is also a theoretical interest in knowing how similar the two grammar formalisms are.
Since Grammatical Framework is more expressive than Regulus, the resulting Regulus grammars can be overgenerating.
We therefore describe a subclass of Grammatical Framework for which the algorithm results in an equivalent Regulus grammar.
