<newSection> Abstract As a step toward conversational systems that allow for a more natural human-computer interaction, we repOrton GsG, a system that, while providing a natural-language interface to a variety of applications, engages in clarification dialogues with the end user through which new semantic mappings are dynamically acquired.
GSG exploits task- and language-dependent information but is fully task-and language-independent in its architecture and strategies.
