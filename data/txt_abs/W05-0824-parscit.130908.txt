<newSection> Abstract Thanks to the profusion of freely available tools, it recently became fairly easy to built a statistical machine translation (SMT) engine given a bitext.
The expectations we can have on the quality of such a system may however greatly vary from one pair of languages to another.
We report on our experiments in building phrase-based translation engines for the four pairs of languages we had to consider for the SMT shared-task.
