<newSection> Abstract This paper presents an evaluation of an ensemble–based system that participated in the English and Spanish lexical sample tasks of SENSEVAL-2.
The system combines decision trees of unigrams, bigrams, and co–occurrences into a single classifier.
The analysis is extended to include the SENSEVAL-1 data.
