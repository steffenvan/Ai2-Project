<newSection> Abstract Our participation in the shared translation task at WMT-08 focusses on news translation from English to French.
Our main goal is to contrast a baseline version of the phrase-based MATRAX system, with a version that incorporates syntactic “coupling” features in order to discriminate translations produced by the baseline system.
We report results comparing different feature combinations.
