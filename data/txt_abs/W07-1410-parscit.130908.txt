<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our experiments on Textual Entailment in the context of the Third Pascal Recognising Textual Entailment (RTE-3) Evaluation Challenge.
Our system uses a Machine Learning approach with Support Vector Machines and AdaBoost to deal with the RTE challenge.
We perform a lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis of the entailment pairs . From this information we compute a set of semantic-based distances between sentences.
The results look promising specially for the QA entailment task.
