<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a methodology for the automatic acquisition of lexical and morpho—syntactic information from raw corpora.
The system uses information about the inflectional morphology declared by rules and is based on the co—occurrence of different forms of the same paradigm in the corpus.
A direct application of this methodology gives very poor precision rates due to rule interaction between paradigms.
We present a rule analysis algorithm that solves this problem, giving quite better precision rates, although recall decreases dramatically.
Finally, we investigate some techniques to raise the recall, achieving recall rates around 67% with a precision of 92%.
