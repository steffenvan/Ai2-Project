<newSection> Abstract Machine transliteration has a number of applications in a variety of natural language processing related tasks such as machine translation, information retrieval and question-answering.
For automated learning of machine transliteration, a large parallel corpus of names in two scripts is required.
In this paper we present a simple yet powerful method for automatic mining of Hindi-English names from a parallel corpus.
An average 93% precision and 85% recall is achieved in mining of proper names.
The method works even with a small corpus.
We compare our results with Giza++ word alignment tool that yields 30% precision and 63% recall on the same corpora.
We also demonstrate that this very method of name mining works for other Indian languages as well.
