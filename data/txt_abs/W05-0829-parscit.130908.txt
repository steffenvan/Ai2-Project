<newSection> Abstract This article describes the competitive grouping algorithm at the core of our Integrated Segmentation and Alignment (ISA) model.
ISA extracts phrase pairs from a bilingual corpus without requiring the precalculated word alignment as many other phrase alignment models do.
Experiments conducted within the WPT-05 shared task on statistical machine translation demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of this approach.
