<newSection> Abstract We apply algorithms for the identification of cognates and recurrent sound correspondences proposed by Kondrak (2002) to the Totonac-Tepehua family of indigenous languages in Mexico.
We show that by combining expert linguistic knowledge with computational analysis, it is possible to quickly identify a large number of cognate sets within the family.
Our objective is to provide tools for rapid construction of comparative dictionaries for relatively unfamiliar language families.
