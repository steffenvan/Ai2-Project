<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a distributed dialogue management scheme for speech-based information seeking dialogue.
The dialogue management is distributed to several components, supported by a general blackboard-type architecture for speech systems.
By breaking down the dialogue management, we can achieve more general solutions and support sophisticated decision making algorithms.
