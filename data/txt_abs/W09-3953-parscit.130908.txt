<newSection> Abstract We present a dialogue annotation scheme for both spoken and written interaction, and use it in a telephone transaction corpus and an email corpus.
We train classifiers, comparing regular SVM and structured SVM against a heuristic baseline.
We provide a novel application of structured SVM to predicting relations between instance pairs.
