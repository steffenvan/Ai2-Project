<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we argue that clustering WordNet senses into more coarse-grained groupings results in higher inter-annotator agreement and increased system performance.
Clustering of verb senses involves examining syntactic and semantic features of verbs and arguments on a case-by-case basis rather than applying a strict methodology.
Determining appropriate criteria for clustering is based primarily on the needs of annotators.
