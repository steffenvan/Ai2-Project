<newSection> Abstract Domain portability and adaptation of NLP components and Word Sense Disambiguation systems present new challenges.
The difficulties found by supervised systems to adapt might change the way we assess the strengths and weaknesses of supervised and knowledge-based WSD systems.
Unfortunately, all existing evaluation datasets for specific domains are lexical-sample corpora.
With this paper we want to motivate the creation of an allwords test dataset for WSD on the environment domain in several languages, and present the overall design of this SemEval task.
