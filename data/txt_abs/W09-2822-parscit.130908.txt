<newSection> Abstract This article presents the machine learning approach used by the University of Wolverhampton in the GREC-NEGâ€™09 task.
A classifier based on J48 decision tree and a meta-classifier were used to produce two runs.
Evaluation on the development set shows that the metaclassifier achieves a better performance.
