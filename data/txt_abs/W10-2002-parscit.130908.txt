<newSection> Abstract Natural language as well as other communication forms are constrained by cognitive function and evolved through a social process.
Here, we examine whether human memory may be uniquely adapted to the social structures prevalent in groups, specifically small-world networks.
The emergence of domain languages is simulated using an empirically evaluated ACT-R-based cognitive model of agents in a naming game played within communities.
Several community structures are examined (grids, trees, random graphs and small-world networks).
We present preliminary results from small-scale simulations, showing relative robustness of cognitive models to network structure.
