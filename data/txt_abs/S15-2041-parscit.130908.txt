<newSection> Abstract This paper reports the description and performance of our system, FBK-HLT, participating in the SemEval 2015, Task #3 &quot;Answer Selection in Community Question Answering&quot; for English, for both subtasks.
We submit two runs with different classifiers in combining typical features (lexical similarity, string similarity, word n-grams, etc.) with machine translation evaluation metrics and with some ad hoc features (e.g user overlapping, spam filtering).
We outperform the baseline system and achieve interesting results on both subtasks.
