<newSection> Abstract TimeML, TimeBank, and TTK (TARSQI Project) have been playing an important role in enhancement of IE, QA, and other NLP applications.
TimeML is a specification language for events and temporal expressions in text.
This paper presents the problems and solutions for porting TimeML to Korean as a part of the Korean TARSQI Project.
We also introduce the KTTK which is an automatic markup tool of temporal and event-denoting expressions in Korean text.
