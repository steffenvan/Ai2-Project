<newSection> Abstract Human listeners can almost instantaneously judge whether or not another speaker is part of their speech community.
The basis of this judgment is the speakerâ€™s accent.
Even though humans judge speech accents with ease, it has been tremendously difficult to automatically evaluate and rate accents in any consistent manner.
This paper describes an experiment using the Amazon Mechanical Turk to develop an automatic speech accent rating dataset.
