<newSection> Abstract We propose a data-driven method for automatically analyzing the morphology of ancient Greek.
This method improves on existing ancient Greek analyzers in two ways.
First, through the use of a nearest-neighbor machine learning framework, the analyzer requires no hand-crafted rules.
Second, it is able to predict novel roots, and to rerank its predictions by exploiting a large, unlabelled corpus of ancient Greek.
