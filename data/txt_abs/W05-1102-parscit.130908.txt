<newSection> 1 Introduction The availability of large-scale syntactically-annotated corpora in general, and the Penn Treebank1 (PTB; Marcus et al., 1994) in particular, has enabled the field of stochastic parsing to advance rapidly over the course of the last 10-15 years.
However, the newspaper English which makes up the bulk of the PTB is only one of many distinct genres of writing in the Anglophone world, and certainly not the only domain where potential natural-language processing (NLP) applications exist that would benefit from robust and reliable syntactic analysis.
Due to the massive glut of published literature, the biomedical sciences in general, and molecular biology in particular, constitute one such domain, and indeed much attention has been focused recently on NLP in this area (Shatkay and Feldman, 2003; Cohen and Hunter, 2004).
Unfortunately, annotated corpora of a large enough size to retrain stochastic parsers on do not exist in this domain, and are unlikely to for some time.
This is partially due to the same differences of vocabulary and usage that set biomedical English apart from the Wall Street Journal in the first place; these differences necessitate the input of both biological and linguistic knowledge on biological corpus annotation projects (Kulick et al., 2004), and thus require a wider variety of annotator skills than general-English projects.
For example, 50 (pronounced “five-prime”) is an adjective in molecular biology, but p53 is a noun; amino acid
