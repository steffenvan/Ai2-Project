<newSection> Abstract A computationally relevant theory of lexical semantics must take into consideration both the form and the content of three different static knowledge sources â€” the lexicon, the ontological domain model and a text meaning representation language.
Meanings of lexical units are interpreted in terms of their mappings into the ontology and/or their contributions to the text meaning representation.
We briefly describe one such theory.
Its precepts have been used in DIONYSUS, a machine translation system prototype.
