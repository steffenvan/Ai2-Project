<newSection> Abstract Reviews depict sentiments of customers towards various aspects of a product or service.
Some of these aspects can be grouped into coarser aspect categories.
SemEval-2014 had a shared task (Task 4) on aspect-level sentiment analysis, with over 30 teams participated.
In this paper, we describe our submissions, which stood first in detecting aspect categories, first in detecting sentiment towards aspect categories, third in detecting aspect terms, and first and second in detecting sentiment towards aspect terms in the laptop and restaurant domains, respectively.
