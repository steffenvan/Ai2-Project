<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the design and implementation of a lexicon of Dutch multiword expressions (MWEs).
No exhaustive research on a standard lexical representation of MWEs has been done for Dutch before.
The approach taken is innovative, since it is based on the Equivalence Class Method.
Furthermore, the selection of the lexical entries and their properties is corpus-based.
The design of the lexicon and the standard representation will be tested in Dutch NLP systems.
The purpose of the current paper is to give an overview of the decisions made in order to come to a standard lexical representation and to discuss the description fields this representation comprises.
