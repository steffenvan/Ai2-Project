<newSection> Abstract IF (Interchange Format), the interlingua used by the C-STAR consortium, is a speech-act based interlingua for task-oriented dialogue.
IF was designed as a practical interlingua that could strike a balance between expressivity and simplicity.
If it is too simple, components of meaning will be lost and coverage of unseen data will be low.
On the other hand, if it is too complex, it cannot be used with a high degree of consistency by collaborators on different continents.
In this paper, we suggest methods for evaluating the coverage of IF and the consistency with which it was used in the C-STAR consortium.
