<newSection> Abstract Transcription and semantic annotation .(annoscription) of utterances is crucial part of speech performance analysis and tuning of spoken dialog systems and other natural language processing disciplines.
However, the fact that these are manual tasks makes them expensive and slow.
In this paper, we will discuss how annoscription can be partially automated.
We will show that annoscription can reach a throughput of 693 thousand utterances per person month under certain assumptions.
