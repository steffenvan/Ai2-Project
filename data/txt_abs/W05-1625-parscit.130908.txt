<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we propose an approach for content determination and surface generation of answers in a question-answering system on the web.
The content determination is based on a coherence rate which takes into account coherence with other potential answers.
Answer generation is made through the use of classical techniques and templates and is based on a certainty degree.
