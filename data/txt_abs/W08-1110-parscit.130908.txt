<newSection> Abstract This paper reports on attempts at Aberdeen1 to measure the effects on readers’ emotions of positively and negatively “slanted” texts with the same basic message.
The “slanting” methods could be implemented in an (NLG) system.
We discuss a number of possible reasons why the studies were unable to show clear, statistically significant differences between the effects of the different texts.
