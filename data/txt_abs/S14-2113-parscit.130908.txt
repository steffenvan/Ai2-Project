<newSection> Abstract Twitter has become more and more an important resource of user-generated data.
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter is interesting for many applications and objectives.
In this paper, we propose to exploit some features which can be useful for this task; the main contribution is the use of Z-scores as features for sentiment classification in addition to pre-polarity and POS tags features.
Our experiments have been evaluated using the test data provided by SemEval 2013 and 2014.
The evaluation demonstrates that Z_scores features can significantly improve the prediction performance.
