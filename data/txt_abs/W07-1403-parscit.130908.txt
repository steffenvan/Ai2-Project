<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our system as used in the RTE3 task.
The system maps premise and hypothesis pairs into an abstract knowledge representation (AKR) and then performs entailment and contradiction detection (ECD) on the resulting AKRs.
Two versions of ECD were used in RTE3, one with strict ECD and one with looser ECD.
