<newSection> Abstract Web applications have the opportunity to check spelling, style, and grammar using a software service architecture.
A software service authoring aid can offer contextual spell checking, detect real word errors, and avoid poor grammar checker suggestions through the use of large language models.
Here we present After the Deadline, an open source authoring aid, used in production on Word-Press.com, a blogging platform with over ten million writers.
We discuss the benefits of the software service environment and how it affected our choice of algorithms.
We summarize our design principles as speed over accuracy, simplicity over complexity, and do what works.
