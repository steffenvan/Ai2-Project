<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the augmented three-pass system combination framework of the Dublin City University (DCU) MT group for the WMT 2010 system combination task.
The basic three-pass framework includes building individual confusion networks (CNs), a super network, and a modified Minimum Bayes-risk (mCon-MBR) decoder.
The augmented parts for WMT2010 tasks include 1) a rescoring component which is used to re-rank the N-best lists generated from the individual CNs and the super network, 2) a new hypothesis alignment metric – TERp – that is used to carry out English-targeted hypothesis alignment, and 3) more different backbone-based CNs which are employed to increase the diversity of the mConMBR decoding phase.
We took part in the combination tasks of English-to-Czech and French-to-English.
Experimental results show that our proposed combination framework achieved 2.17 absolute points (13.36 relative points) and 1.52 absolute points (5.37 relative points) in terms of BLEU score on English-toCzech and French-to-English tasks respectively than the best single system.
We also achieved better performance on human evaluation.
