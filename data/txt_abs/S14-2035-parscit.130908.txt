<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our participation at SemEval2014 sentiment analysis task, in both contextual and message polarity classification.
Our idea was to compare two different techniques for sentiment analysis.
First, a machine learning classifier specifically built for the task using the provided training corpus.
On the other hand, a lexicon-based approach using natural language processing techniques, developed for a generic sentiment analysis task with no adaptation to the provided training corpus.
Results, though far from the best runs, prove that the generic model is more robust as it achieves a more balanced evaluation for message polarity along the different test sets.
