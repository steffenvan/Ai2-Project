<newSection> Abstract Most state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems use log-linear models, which are defined in terms of hypothesis features and weights for those features.
It is standard to tune the feature weights in order to maximize a translation quality metric, using held-out test sentences and their corresponding reference translations.
However, obtaining reference translations is expensive.
In this paper, we introduce a new full-sentence paraphrase technique, based on English-to-English decoding with an MT system, and we demonstrate that the resulting paraphrases can be used to drastically reduce the number of human reference translations needed for parameter tuning, without a significant decrease in translation quality.
