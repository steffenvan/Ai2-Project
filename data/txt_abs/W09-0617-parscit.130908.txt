<newSection> Abstract This paper gives an overview of ongoing work on a system for the generation of NL descriptions of classes defined in OWL ontologies.
We present a general structuring approach for such descriptions.
Since OWL ontologies do not by default contain the information necessary for lexicalization, lexical information has to be added to the data via annotations.
A rule-based mechanism for automatically deriving these annotations is presented.
