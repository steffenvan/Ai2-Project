<newSection> Abstract A dialogue system can present itself and/or address the user as an active agent by means of linguistic constructions in personal style, or suppress agentivity by using impersonal style.
We compare system evaluation judgments and input style alignment of users interacting with an in-car dialogue system generating output in personal vs. impersonal style.
Although our results are consistent with earlier findings obtained with simulated systems, the effects are weaker.
