<newSection> Abstract Our submission to the Semeval 2010 task on coreference resolution in multiple languages is based on parse analysis and similarity clustering.
The system uses a binary classifier, based on Maximum Entropy, to decide whether or not there is a relationship between each pair of mentions extracted from a textual document.
Mention detection is based on the analysis of the dependency parse tree.
