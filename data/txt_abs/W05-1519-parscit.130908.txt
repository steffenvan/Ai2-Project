<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our effort on the task of edited region identification for parsing disfluent sentences in the Switchboard corpus.
We focus our attention on exploring feature spaces and selecting good features and start with analyzing the distributions of the edited regions and their components in the targeted corpus.
We explore new feature spaces of a partof-speech (POS) hierarchy and relaxed for rough copy in the experiments.
These steps result in an improvement of 43.98% percent relative error reduction in F-score over an earlier best result in edited detection when punctuation is included in both training and testing data [Charniak and Johnson 2001], and 20.44% percent relative error reduction in F-score over the latest best result where punctuation is excluded from the training and testing data [Johnson and Charniak 2004].
