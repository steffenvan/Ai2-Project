<newSection> Abstract A novel method is presented for compiling two-level rules which have multiple context parts.
The same method can also be applied to the resolution of so-called right-arrow rule conflicts.
The method makes use of the fact that one can efficiently compose sets of two-level rules with a lexicon transducer.
By introducing variant characters and using simple pre-processing of multi-context rules, all rules can be reduced into single-context rules.
After the modified rules have been combined with the lexicon transducer, the variant characters may be reverted back to the original surface characters.
The proposed method appears to be efficient but only partial evidence is presented yet.
