<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a technique for automatically tagging political blog posts using SVMâ€™s and named entity recognition.
We compare the quality of the tags detected by this approach to earlier approaches in other domains, observing effects from the political domain and benefits from NLP techniques complementary to the core SVM method.
