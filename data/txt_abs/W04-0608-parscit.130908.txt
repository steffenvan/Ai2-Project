<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we describe an integrated approach towards dealing with various semantic and structural issues associated with document management.
We provide motivations for using XML, RDF and OWL in building a seamless architecture to serve not only as a document exchange service but also to enable higher level services such as annotations, metadata access and querying.
The key idea is to manifest differential treatments for the actual document structure, semantic content of the document and ontological document organization.
The deployment of this architecture in the PROTEUS project1 provides an industrial setting for evaluation and further specification.
