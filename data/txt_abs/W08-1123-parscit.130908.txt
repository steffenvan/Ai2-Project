<newSection> Abstract We describe the creation of a new domain for the Methodius Natural Language Generation System, and an evaluation of Methodiusâ€™ parameterized comparison generation algorithm.
The new domain was based around music and performers, and texts about the domain were generated using Methodius.
Our evaluation showed that test subjects learned more from texts that contained comparisons than from those that did not.
We also established that the comparison generation algorithm could generalize to the music domain.
