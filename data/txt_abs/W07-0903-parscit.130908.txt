<newSection> Abstract Importing large amounts of data into databases does not always go without the loss of important information.
In this work, methods are presented that aim to rediscover this information by inferring it from the information that is available in the database.
From and animal specimen database, the information to which expedition an animal that was found belongs is rediscovered.
While the work is in an early stage, the obtained results are promising, and prove that it is possible to rediscover expedition information from the database.
