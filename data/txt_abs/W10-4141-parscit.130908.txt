<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we present the proposed method of participating SIGHAN-2010 Chinese word segmentation bake-off.
In this year, our focus aims to quick train and test the given data.
Unlike the most structural learning algorithms, such as conditional random fields, we design an in-house development conditional support vector Markov model (CMM) framework.
The method is very quick to train and also show better performance in accuracy than CRF.
To give a fair comparison, we compare our method to CRF with three additional tasks, namely, CoNLL-2000 chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmentation.
The results were encourage and indicated that the proposed CMM produces better not only accuracy but also training time efficiency.
The official results in SIGHAN-2010 also demonstrates that our method perform very well in traditional Chinese with fine-tuned features set.
