<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our submission for the *SEM shared task of Semantic Textual Similarity.
We estimate the semantic similarity between two sentences using regression models with features: 1) n-gram hit rates (lexical matches) between sentences, 2) lexical semantic similarity between non-matching words, 3) string similarity metrics, 4) affective content similarity and 5) sentence length.
Domain adaptation is applied in the form of independent models and a model selection strategy achieving a mean correlation of 0.47.
