<newSection> Abstract We describe SUPPLE, a freely-available, open source natural language parsing system, implemented in Prolog, and designed for practical use in language engineering (LE) applications.
SUPPLE can be run as a stand-alone application, or as a component within the GATE General Architecture for Text Engineering.
SUPPLE is distributed with an example grammar that has been developed over a number of years across several LE projects.
This paper describes the key characteristics of the parser and the distributed grammar.
