<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we propose an approach for designing the confirmation strategies in a Railway Information system for Spanish, based on confidence measures obtained from recognition.
We also present several error recover and user-modelling techniques incorporated in this system.
In the field evaluation, it is shown that more than 60% of the confirmations were implicit ones.
This kind of confirmations, in combination with fast error recover and user modelling techniques, makes the dialogue faster, obtaining a mean call duration of 204 seconds.
