<newSection> Abstract This paper proposes a novel method for long distance, clause-level reordering in statistical machine translation (SMT).
The proposed method separately translates clauses in the source sentence and reconstructs the target sentence using the clause translations with non-terminals.
The nonterminals are placeholders of embedded clauses, by which we reduce complicated clause-level reordering into simple word-level reordering.
Its translation model is trained using a bilingual corpus with clause-level alignment, which can be automatically annotated by our alignment algorithm with a syntactic parser in the source language.
We achieved significant improvements of 1.4% in BLEU and 1.3% in TER by using Moses, and 2.2% in BLEU and 3.5% in TER by using our hierarchical phrase-based SMT, for the English-to-Japanese translation of research paper abstracts in the medical domain.
