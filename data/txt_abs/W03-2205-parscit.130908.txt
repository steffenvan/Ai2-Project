<newSection> Abstract A new technique for monotone segmentation of parallel corpora is introduced.
This segmentation is based on a set of anchor words which are defined manually.
The parallel segments are computed using a dynamic programming algorithm.
To assess this technique, finite-state transducers are inferred from both non-segmented and segmented corpora.
Experiments have been carried out with Spanish-English and Italian-English translation tasks.
This technique has proven useful in improving the results with respect to those obtained with unsegmented corpora.
