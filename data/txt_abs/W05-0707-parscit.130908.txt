<newSection> Abstract We applied Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to the tasks of Amharic word segmentation and POS tagging using a small annotated corpus of 1000 words.
Given the size of the data and the large number of unknown words in the test corpus (80%), an accuracy of 84% for Amharic word segmentation and 74% for POS tagging is encouraging, indicating the applicability of CRFs for a morphologically complex language like Amharic.
