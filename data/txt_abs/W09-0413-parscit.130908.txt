<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe the statistical machine translation system of the UniversitÂ¨at Karlsruhe developed for the translation task of the Fourth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.
The state-ofthe-art phrase-based SMT system is augmented with alternative word reordering and alignment mechanisms as well as optional phrase table modifications.
We participate in the constrained condition of German-English and English-German as well as in the constrained condition of French-English and English-French.
