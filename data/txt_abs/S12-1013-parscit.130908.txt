<newSection> Abstract We report ongoing work on the development of agents that can implicitly coordinate with their partners in referential tasks, taking as a case study colour terms.
We describe algorithms for generation and resolution of colour descriptions and report results of experiments on how humans use colour terms for reference in production and comprehension.
