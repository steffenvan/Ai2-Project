<newSection> Abstract There is increasing interest in using corpora in NLG, perhaps because of the success of corpus-based techniques in other areas of speech and language processing.
Many uses of corpora in NLG implicitly assume that the human-authored texts in a corpora are a 'gold standard', in other words that the NLG system should produce texts similar to the corpora texts.
However, our experience with several corpora raises questions about this assumption, because human authors make mistakes and because different people write differently.
