<newSection> Abstract: The paper presents a rapid method of developing a shallow Arabic morphological analyzer.
The analyzer will only be concerned with generating the possible roots of any given Arabic word.
The analyzer is based on automatically derived rules and statistics.
For evaluation, the analyzer is compared to a commercially available Arabic Morphological Analyzer.
