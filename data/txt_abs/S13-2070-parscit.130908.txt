<newSection> Abstract This paper is an overview of the SwatCS system submitted to SemEval-2013 Task 2A: Contextual Polarity Disambiguation.
The sentiment of individual phrases within a tweet are labeled using a combination of classifiers trained on a range of lexical features.
The classifiers are combined by estimating the accuracy of the classifiers on each tweet.
Performance is measured when using only the provided training data, and separately when including external data.
