<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our system submitted to *SEM 2013 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) core task which aims to measure semantic similarity of two given text snippets.
In this shared task, we propose an interpolation STS model named Model_LIM integrating FrameNet parsing information, which has a good performance with low time complexity compared with former submissions.
