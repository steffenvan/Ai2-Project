<newSection> Abstract We describe an algebraic approach for computing with vector based semantics.
The tensor product has been proposed as a method of composition, but has the undesirable property that strings of different length are incomparable.
We consider how a quotient algebra of the tensor algebra can allow such comparisons to be made, offering the possibility of data-driven models of semantic composition.
