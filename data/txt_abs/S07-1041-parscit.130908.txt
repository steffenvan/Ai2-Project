<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe a person clustering system for web pages and report the results we have obtained on the test set of the Semeval 2007 Web Person Search task.
Deciding which particular person a name refers to within a text document depends mainly on the capacity to extract the relevant information out of texts when it is present.
We consider “relevant” here to stand primarily for two properties: (1) uniqueness and (2) appropriateness.
In order to address both (1) and (2) our method gives primary importance to Name Entities (NEs), defined according to the ACE specifications.
The common nouns not referring to entities are considered further as coreference clues only if they are found within already coreferred documents.
