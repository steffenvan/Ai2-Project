<newSection> 1 Introduction As more and more syntactically-annotated corpora become available for a wide variety of languages, machine learning approaches to parsing gain interest as a means of developing parsers without having to repeat some of the labor-intensive and language-specific activities required for traditional parser development, such as manual grammar engineering, for each new language.
The CoNLL-X shared task on multi-lingual dependency parsing (Buchholz et al., 2006) aims to evaluate and advance the state-ofthe-art in machine learning-based dependency parsing by providing a standard benchmark set comprising thirteen languages1.
In this paper, we describe two different machine learning approaches to the CoNLL-X shared task.
Before introducing the two learning-based approaches, we first describe a number of baselines, which provide simple reference scores giving some sense of the difficulty of each language.
Next, we present two machine learning systems: 1) an approach that directly predicts all dependency relations in a single run over the input sentence, and 2) a cascade of phrase recognizers.
The first approach has been found to perform best and was selected for submission to the competition.
We conclude this paper with a detailed error analysis of its output for two of the thirteen languages, Dutch and Spanish.
