<newSection> Abstract This paper reports on a system developed for the BioNLP'09 shared task on detection and characterisation of biomedical events.
Event triggers and types were recognised using a conditional random field classifier and a set of rules, while event participants were identified using a rule-based system that relied on relative distances between candidate entities and the trigger in the associated parse tree.
The results on previously unseen test data were encouraging: for non-regulatory events, the Fscore was almost 50% (with precision above 60%), with the overall F-score of around 30% (49% precision).
The performance on more complex regulatory events was poor (F-measure of 7%).
Among the 24 teams submitting the test results, our results were ranked 12th for the overall F-score and 8th for the F-score of non-regulation events.
