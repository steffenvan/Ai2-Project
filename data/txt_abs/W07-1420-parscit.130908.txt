<newSection> Abstract This paper presents two systems for textual entailment, both employing decision trees as a supervised learning algorithm.
The first one is based primarily on the concept of lexical overlap, considering a bag of words similarity overlap measure to form a mapping of terms in the hypothesis to the source text.
The second system is a lexicosemantic matching between the text and the hypothesis that attempts an alignment between chunks in the hypothesis and chunks in the text, and a representation of the text and hypothesis as two dependency graphs.
Their performances are compared and their positive and negative aspects are analyzed.
