<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present a report of the two different runs submitted to the task 8 of Semeval 2012 for the evaluation of Cross-lingual Textual Entailment in the framework of Content Synchronization.
Both approaches are based on textual similarity, and the entailment judgment (bidirectional, forward, backward or no entailment) is given based on a set of decision rules.
The first approach uses textual similarity on the translated and original versions of the texts, whereas the second approach expands the terms by means of synonyms.
The evaluation of both approaches show a similar behavior which is still close to the average and median.
