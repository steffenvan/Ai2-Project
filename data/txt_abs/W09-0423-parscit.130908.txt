<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the development of several machine translation systems for the 2009 WMT shared task evaluation.
We only consider the translation between French and English.
We describe a statistical system based on the Moses decoder and a statistical post-editing system using SYSTRANâ€™s rule-based system.
We also investigated techniques to automatically extract additional bilingual texts from comparable corpora.
