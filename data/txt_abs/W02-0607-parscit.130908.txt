<newSection> Abstract We describe here a supervised learning model that, given paradigms of related words, learns the morphological and phonological rules needed to derive the paradigm.
The model can use its rules to make guesses about how novel forms would be inflected, and has been tested experimentally against the intuitions of human speakers.
