<newSection> Abstract This paper presents the design of a discourse generator that plans the content and organization of lay-oriented genetic counseling documents containing arguments, and an experiment to evaluate the arguments.
Due to the separation of domain, argument, and genre-specific concerns and the methodology used for acquiring a domain model, this approach should be applicable to argument generation in other domains.
