<newSection> Abstract This paper describes experiments in classifying sentences of medical abstracts into a number of semantic classes given by section headings in structured abstracts.
Using conditional random fields, we obtain F-scores ranging from 0.72 to 0.97.
By using a small set of sentences that appear under the PAR-TICPANTS heading, we demonstrate that it is possible to recognize sentences that describe population characteristics of a study.
We present a detailed study of the structure of abstracts of randomized clinical trials, and examine how sentences labeled under PARTICIPANTS could be used to summarize the population group.
