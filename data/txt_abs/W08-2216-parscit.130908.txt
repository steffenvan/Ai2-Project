<newSection> Abstract There has recently been a great deal of work aimed at trying to extract information from substantial texts for tasks such as question answering.
Much of this work has dealt with texts which are reasonably large, but which are known to contain reliable relevant information, e.g. FAQ lists, on-line encyclopaedias, rather than looking at huge unorganised resources such as the web.
We believe, however, that even this work underestimates the complexity and subtlety of language, and hence will inevitably be restricted in what it can cope with.
In particular, everyday use of language involves considerable amounts of reasoning over intensional objects (properties and propositions).
In order to respond appropriately to simple-seeming questions such as ‘Is going for a walk good for me?’, for instance, you have to be able to talk about event-types, which are intrinsically intensional.
We discuss the issues involved in handling such items, and shows the kind of background knowledge that is required for drawing the appropriate conclusions about them.
