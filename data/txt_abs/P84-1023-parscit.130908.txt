<newSection> Abstract Sublanguages differ from each other, and from the &quot;standard language&quot;, in their syntactic, semantic, and discourse properties.
Understanding these differences is important if we are to improve our ability to process these sublanguages.
We have developed a semiautomatic procedure for identifying sublanguage syntactic usage from a sample of text in the sublanguage.
We describe the results of applying this procedure to three text samples: two sets of medical documents and a set of equipment failure messages.
