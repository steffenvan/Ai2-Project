<newSection> Abstract As the organizers of the ACL 2007 Deep Linguistic Processing workshop (Baldwin et al., 2007), we were asked to discuss our perspectives on the role of current trends in deep linguistic processing for parsing technology.
We are particularly interested in the ways in which efficient, broad coverage parsing systems for linguistically expressive grammars can be built and integrated into applications which require richer syntactic structures than shallow approaches can provide.
This often requires hybrid technologies which use shallow or statistical methods for pre- or post-processing, to extend coverage, or to disambiguate the output.
