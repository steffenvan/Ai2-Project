<newSection> Abstract This paper presents an algorithm for incremental chart parsing, outlines how this could be embedded in an interactive parsing system, and discusses why this might be useful.
Incremental parsing here means that input is analysed in a piecemeal fashion, in particular allowing arbitrary changes of previous input without exhaustive reanalysis.
Interactive parsing means that the analysis process is prompted immediately at the onset of new input, and possibly that the system then may interact with the user in order to resolve problems that occur.
The combination of these techniques could be used as a parsing kernel for highly interactive and &quot;reactive&quot; natural-language processors, such as parsers for dialogue systems, interactive computer-aided translation systems, and language-sensitive text editors.
An incremental chart parser embodying the ideas put forward in this paper has been implemented, and an embedding of this in an interactive parsing system is near completion.
