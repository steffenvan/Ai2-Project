<newSection> Abstract Event clustering on streaming news aims to group documents by events automatically.
This paper employs co-reference chains to extract the most representative sentences, and then uses them to select the most informative features for clustering.
Due to the long span of events, a fixed threshold approach prohibits the latter documents to be clustered and thus decreases the performance.
A dynamic threshold using time decay function and spanning window is proposed.
Besides the noun phrases in co-reference chains, event words in each sentence are also introduced to improve the related performance.
Two models are proposed.
The experimental results show that both event words and co-reference chains are useful on event clustering.
