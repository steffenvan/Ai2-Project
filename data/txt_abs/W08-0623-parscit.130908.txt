<newSection> 1 Overview This paper is focused on determining which proteins affect the activity of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) system when learning a model that can accurately predict its activity when single genes are knocked out.
Experiments with results are presented when models are trained on a single source of information: abstracts from Medline (http://medline.cos.com/) that talk about the genes involved in the experiments.
The results suggest that AdaBoost classifier with a binary bag-of-words representation obtains significantly better results.
