<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present a hybrid approach for identifying Japanese functional expressions and its application in a Japanese reading assistant.
We combine the results of machine learning and pattern-based methods to identify several types of functional expressions.
We show that by using our approach we can double the coverage of previous approaches and still maintain the high level of performance necessary for our application.
