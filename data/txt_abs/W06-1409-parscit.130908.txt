<newSection> Abstract It is often desirable that referring expressions be chosen in such a way that their referents are easy to identify.
In this paper, we investigate to what extent identification becomes easier by the addition of logically redundant properties.We focus on hierarchically structured domains, whose content is not fully known to the reader when the referring expression is uttered.
