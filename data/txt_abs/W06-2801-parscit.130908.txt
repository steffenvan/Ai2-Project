<newSection> Abstract We analyze four different types of document networks with respect to their small world characteristics.
These characteristics allow distinguishing wiki-based systems from citation and more traditional text-based networks augmented by hyperlinks.
The study provides evidence that a more appropriate network model is needed which better reflects the specifics of wiki systems.
It puts emphasize on their topological differences as a result of wiki-related linking compared to other text-based networks.
