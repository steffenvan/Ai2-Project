<newSection> Abstract Named entity recognition is a fundamental task in biological relationship mining.
This paper employs protein collocates extracted from a biological corpus to enhance the performance of protein name recognizers.
Yapex and KeX are taken as examples.
The precision of Yapex is increased from 70.90% to 81.94% at the low expense of recall rate (i.e., only decrease 2.39%) when collocates are incorporated.
We also integrate the results proposed by Yapex and KeX, and employs collocates to filter the merged results.
Because the candidates suggested by these two systems may be inconsistent, i.e., overlap in partial, one of them is considered as a basis.
The experiments show that Yapex-based integration is better than KeX-based integration.
