<newSection> Abstract Multiword expressions (MWEs) have been proved useful for many natural language processing tasks.
However, how to use them to improve performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) is not well studied.
This paper presents a simple yet effective strategy to extract domain bilingual multiword expressions.
In addition, we implement three methods to integrate bilingual MWEs to Moses, the state-ofthe-art phrase-based machine translation system.
Experiments show that bilingual MWEs could improve translation performance significantly.
