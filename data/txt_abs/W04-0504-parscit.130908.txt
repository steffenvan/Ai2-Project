<newSection> Abstract In this paper we highlight a selection of features of scientific text which distinguish it from news stories.
We argue that features such as structure, selective use of past tense, voice and stylistic conventions can affect question answering in the scientific domain.
We demonstrate this through qualitative observations made while working on retrieving definitions to terms related to salmon fish.
