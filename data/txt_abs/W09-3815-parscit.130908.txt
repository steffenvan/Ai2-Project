<newSection> Abstract We apply the idea of weight pushing (Mohri, 1997) to CKY parsing with fixed context-free grammars.
Applied after rule binarization, weight pushing takes the weight from the original grammar rule and pushes it down across its binarized pieces, allowing the parser to make better pruning decisions earlier in the parsing process.
This process can be viewed as generalizing weight pushing from transducers to hypergraphs.
We examine its effect on parsing efficiency with various binarization schemes applied to tree substitution grammars from previous work.
We find that weight pushing produces dramatic improvements in efficiency, especially with small amounts of time and with large grammars.
