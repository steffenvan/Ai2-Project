<newSection> Abstract This paper describes our participation to the Metonymy resolution at SemEval 2007 (task #8).
In order to perform named entity metonymy resolution, we developed a hybrid system based on a robust parser that extracts deep syntactic relations combined with a non-supervised distributional approach, also relying on the relations extracted by the parser.
