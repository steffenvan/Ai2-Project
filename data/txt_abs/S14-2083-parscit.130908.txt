<newSection> Abstract We refined the performance of Cocoa/Peaberry, a linguistically motivated system, on extracting disease entities from clinical notes in the training and development sets for Task 7.
Entities were identified in noun chunks by use of dictionaries, and events (‘The left atrium is dilated’) through our own parser and predicate-argument structures.
We also developed a module to map the extracted entities to the SNOMED subset of UMLS.
The module is based on direct matching against UMLS entries through regular expressions derived from a small set of morphological transformations, along with priority rules when multiple UMLS entries were matched.
The performance on training and development sets was 81.0% and 83.3% respectively (Task A), and the UMLS matching scores were respectively 75.3% and 78.2% (Task B).
However, the performance against the test set was low by comparison, 72.0% for Task A and 63.9% for Task B, even while the pure UMLS mapping score was reasonably high (relaxed score in Task B = 91.2%).
We speculate that our moderate performance on the test set derives primarily from chunking/parsing errors.
