<newSection> Abstract One of the LT1-applications that ensures the access to the information, in the userâ€™s mother tongue, is machine translation (MT).
Unfortunately less spoken languages - a category in which the Balkan and Slavic languages can be included - have to overcome a major gap in language resources, reference-systems and tools.
In its simplest form, statistical machine translation (SMT) is based only on the existence of a big parallel corpus and therefore it seems to be a solution for these languages.
In this paper the performance of a Moses-based SMT system, for Romanian and German, is investigated using test data from two different domains - legislation (JRC-ACQUIS) and a manual of an electronic device.
The obtained results are compared with the ones given by the Google on-line translation tool.
An analysis of the obtained translation results gives an overview of the main challenges and sources of errors in translation, in these experimental settings.
