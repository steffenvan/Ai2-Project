<newSection> Abstract In this article, we first describe the different steps and adaptations that were necessary to develop the VocaBaseTM project.
VocaBase m is a vocal server allowing users to have dialogue with an indexed database.
The original algorithm that we designed allows a dynamic adaptation of the dialogue depending on the database content and on previous choices made by the user.
The flexibility of this algorithm allows the development of complex application required by the current market.
Finally, we describe the VocaBaseTm Studio, an Internet based development environment allowing vocal applications to be developed and tested with different databases.
