<newSection> Abstract In this paper we introduce a methodology for annotating compositional operations in natural language text, and describe a mark-up language, GLML, based on Generative Lexicon, for identifying such relations.
While most annotation systems capture surface relationships, GLML captures the “compositional history” of the argument selection relative to the predicate.
We provide a brief overview of GL before moving on to our proposed methodology for annotating with GLML.
There are three main tasks described in the paper: (i) Compositional mechanisms of argument selection; (ii) Qualia in modification constructions; (iii) Type selection in modification of dot objects.
We explain what each task includes and provide a description of the annotation interface.
We also include the XML format for GLML including examples of annotated sentences.
