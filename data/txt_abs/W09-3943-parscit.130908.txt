<newSection> Abstract We present a toolkit for manipulating and visualising time-aligned linguistic data such as dialogue transcripts or language processing data.
The package complements existing editing tools by allowing for conversion between their formats, information extraction from the raw files, and by adding sophisticated, and easily extended methods for visualising the dynamics of dialogue processing.
To illustrate the versatility of the package, we describe its use in three different projects at our site.
