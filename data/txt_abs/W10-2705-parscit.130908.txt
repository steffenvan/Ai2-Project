<newSection> Abstract A technology demonstrator is one thing but having people use a technology is another, and the result reported here is that people often ignore our lovingly crafted handiwork.
The SERA project - Social Engagement with Robots and Agents was set up to look explicitly at what happens when a robot companion is put in someone’s home.
Even if things worked perfectly, there are times when a companion’s human is simply not engaged.
As a result we have separated our “dialog manager” into two parts: the dialog manager itself that determines what to say next, and an “interaction manager” that determines when to say it.
This paper details the design of this SALT-E architecture.
