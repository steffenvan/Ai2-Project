<newSection> Abstract We discuss a syntactic annotation scheme for Chinese text corpora following a dependency-based framework that admits no intermediate phrasal nodes and allows no crossing of syntactic dependency links.
While one particular approach to syntactic analysis is being followed, dependency annotation facilitates the use of annotated corpora by followers of other approaches.
