<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we proposed a hedge detection method with average perceptron, which was used in the closed challenge in CoNLL-2010 Shared Task.
There are two subtasks: (1) detecting uncertain sentences and (2) identifying the in-sentence scopes of hedge cues.
We use the unified learning algorithm for both subtasks since that the hedge score of sentence can be decomposed into scores of the words, especially the hedge words.
On the biomedical corpus, our methods achieved F-measure with 77.86% in detecting in-domain uncertain sentences, 77.44% in recognizing hedge cues, and 19.27% in identifying the scopes.
