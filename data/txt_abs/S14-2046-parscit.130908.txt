<newSection> Abstract Recently, the task of measuring semantic similarity between given texts has drawn much attention from the Natural Language Processing community.
Especially, the task becomes more interesting when it comes to measuring the semantic similarity between different-sized texts, e.g paragraph-sentence, sentence-phrase, phrase-word, etc.
In this paper, we, the FBK-TR team, describe our system participating in Task 3 &quot;Cross-Level Semantic Similarity&quot;, at SemEval 2014.
We also report the results obtained by our system, compared to the baseline and other participating systems in this task.
