<newSection> Abstract In this paper we describe a system for the recognition and normalization of temporal expressions (Task 13: TempEval-2, Task A).
The recognition task is approached as a classification problem of sentence constituents and the normalization is implemented in a rule-based manner.
One of the system features is extending positive annotations in the corpus by semantically similar words automatically obtained from a large unannotated textual corpus.
The best results obtained by the system are 0.85 and 0.84 for precision and recall respectively for recognition of temporal expressions; the accuracy values of 0.91 and 0.55 were obtained for the feature values TYPE and VAL respectively.
