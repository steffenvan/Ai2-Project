<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present a lightweight stemmer for Gujarati using a hybrid approach.
Instead of using a completely unsupervised approach, we have harnessed linguistic knowledge in the form of a hand-crafted Gujarati suffix list in order to improve the quality of the stems and suffixes learnt during the training phase.
We used the EMILLE corpus for training and evaluating the stemmerâ€™s performance.
The use of hand-crafted suffixes boosted the accuracy of our stemmer by about 17% and helped us achieve an accuracy of 67.86 %.
