<newSection> Abstract Currently access to institutional repositories is gained using dedicated web interfaces where users can enter keywords in an attempt to express their needs.
In many cases this approach is rather cumbersome for users who are required to learn a syntax specific to that particular interface.
To address this problem, we propose to adapt the QALL-ME framework, a reusable framework for fast development of question answering systems, in order to allow users to access information using natural language questions.
This paper describes how the web services part of the QALL-ME framework had to be adapted in order to give access to information gathered from unstructured web pages by the AIR project.
