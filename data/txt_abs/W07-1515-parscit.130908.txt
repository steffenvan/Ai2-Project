<newSection> Abstract The Appraisal framework is a theory of the language of evaluation, developed within the tradition of systemic functional linguistics.
The framework describes a taxonomy of the types of language used to convey evaluation and position oneself with respect to the evaluations of other people.
Accurate automatic recognition of these types of language can inform an analysis of document sentiment.
This paper describes the preparation of test data for algorithms for automatic Appraisal analysis.
The difficulty of the task is assessed by way of an inter-annotator agreement study, based on measures analogous to those used in the MUC-7 evaluation.
