<newSection> Abstract The segmentation of Chinese texts is a key process in Chinese information processing.
The difficulties in segmentation are the process of ambiguous character string and unknown Chinese words.
In order to obtain the correct result, the first is identification of all possible candidates of Chinese words in a text.
In this paper, a data structure Chinese-character-net is put forward, then, based on this character-net, a new algorithm is presented to obtain all possible candidate of Chinese words in a text.
This paper gives the experiment result.
Finally the characteristics of the algorithm are analysed.
