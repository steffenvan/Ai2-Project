<newSection> Abstract This paper proposes an automatic interpretation system that integrates free-style sentence translation and parallel text based translation.
Free-style sentence translation accepts natural language sentences and translates them by machine translation.
Parallel text based translation provides a proper translation for a sentence in the parallel text by referring to a corresponding translation of the sentence and supplements free-style sentence translation.
We developed a prototype of an automatic interpretation system for Japanese overseas travelers with parallel text based translation using 9206 parallel bilingual sentences prepared in task-oriented manner.
Evaluation results show that the parallel text based translation covers 72% of typical utterances for overseas travel and the user can easily find an appropriate sentence from a natural utterance for 64% of typical travelerâ€™s tasks.
This indicates that the user can benefit from reliable translation based on parallel text for fundamental utterances necessary for overseas travel.
