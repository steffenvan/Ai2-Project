<newSection> Abstract The CIAOSENSO WSD system is based on Conceptual Density, WordNet Domains and frequences of WordNet senses.
This paper describes the upv-unige-CIAOSENSO WSD system, we participated in the english all-word task with, and its versions used for the english lexical sample and the WordNet gloss disambiguation tasks.
In the last an additional goal was to check if the disambiguation of glosses, that has been performed during our tests on the SemCor corpus, was done properly or not.
