<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the system developed in collabaration between UCH and UPV for the 2010 WMT.
For this yearâ€™s workshop, we present a system for English-Spanish translation.
Output N-best lists were rescored via a target Neural Network Language Model, yielding improvements in the final translation quality as measured by BLEU and TER.
