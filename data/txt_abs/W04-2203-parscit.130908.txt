<newSection> Abstract In the context of the Papillon project, which aims at creating a multilingual lexical database (MLDB), we have developed Jeminie, an adaptable system that helps automatically building interlingual lexical databases from existing lexical resources.
In this article, we present a taxonomy of criteria for evaluating a MLDB, that motivates the need for arbitrary compositions of criteria to evaluate a whole MLDB.
A quality measurement method is proposed, that is adaptable to different contexts and available lexical resources.
