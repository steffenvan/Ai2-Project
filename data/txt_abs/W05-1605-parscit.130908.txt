<newSection> Abstract Natural language has a high paraphrastic power yet not all paraphrases are appropriate for all contexts.
In this paper, we present a TAG based surface realiser which supports both the generation and the selection of paraphrases.
To deal with the combinatorial explosion typical of such an NP-complete task, we introduce a number of new optimisations in a tabular, bottom-up surface realisation algorithm.
We then show that one of these optimisations supports paraphrase selection.
