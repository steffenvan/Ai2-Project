<newSection> Abstract We introduce the Degrees of Grounding model, which defines the extent to which material being discussed in a dialogue has been grounded.
This model has been developed and evaluated by a corpus analysis, and includes a set of types of evidence of understanding, a set of degrees of groundedness, a set of grounding criteria, and methods for identifying each of these.
We describe how this model can be used for dialogue management.
