<newSection> Abstract Recent studies on word sense induction (WSI) mainly concentrate on European languages, Chinese word sense induction is becoming popular as it presents a new challenge to WSI.
In this paper, we propose a feature-based approach using the spectral clustering algorithm to this problem.
We also compare various clustering algorithms and similarity metrics.
Experimental results show that our system achieves promising performance in F-score.
