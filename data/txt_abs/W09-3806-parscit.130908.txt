<newSection> Abstract Most cellular telephones use numeric keypads, where texting is supported by dictionaries and frequency models.
Given a key sequence, the entry system recognizes the matching words and proposes a rank-ordered list of candidates.
The ranking quality is instrumental to an effective entry.
This paper describes a new method to enhance entry that combines syntax and language models.
We first investigate components to improve the ranking step: language models and semantic relatedness.
We then introduce a novel syntactic model to capture the word context, optimize ranking, and then reduce the number of keystrokes per character (KSPC) needed to write a text.
We finally combine this model with the other components and we discuss the results.
We show that our syntax-based model reaches an error reduction in KSPC of 12.4% on a Swedish corpus over a baseline using word frequencies.
We also show that bigrams are superior to all the other models.
However, bigrams have a memory footprint that is unfit for most devices.
Nonetheless, bigrams can be further improved by the addition of syntactic models with an error reduction that reaches 29.4%.
