<newSection> Abstract Efficient and precise comparison of parser results across frameworks will require a negotiated agreement on a target representation which embodies a good balance of three competing dimensions: consistency, clarity, and flexibility.
The various annotations provided in the COLING-08 shared task for the ten ’required’ Wall Street Journal sentences can serve as a useful basis for these negotations.
While there is of course substantial overlap in the content of the various schemes for these sentences, no one of the schemes is ideal.
This paper presents some desiderata for a negotiated target annotation scheme for which straightforward mappings can be constructed from each of the supplied annotation schemes.
