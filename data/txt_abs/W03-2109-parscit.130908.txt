<newSection> Abstract Recently the technology for speech recognition and language processing for spoken dialogue systems has been improved, and speech recognition systems and dialogue systems have been developed to the extent of practical usage.
In order to become more practical, not only those fundamental techniques but also the techniques of portability and expansibility should be developed.
In our previous research, we demonstrated the portability of the speech recognition module to a developed portal spoken dialogue system.
And we constructed a dialogue strategy design tool of dialogue script for controlling the dialogue strategy.
In this paper, we report a highly portable interpreter using a commercial electronic dictionary.
We apply this to three domains/tasks and confirm the validity of the interpreter for each domain/task.
