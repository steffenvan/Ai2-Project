<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a method of acquiring knowledge from the Web for noun sense disambiguation.
Words, called selectors, are acquired which take the place of an instance of a target word in its local context.
The selectors serve for the system to essentially learn the areas or concepts of WordNet that the sense of a target word should be a part of.
The correct sense is chosen based on a combination of the strength given from similarity and relatedness measures over WordNet and the probability of a selector occurring within the local context.
Our method is evaluated using the coarse-grained all-words task from SemEval 2007.
Experiments reveal that path-based similarity measures perform just as well as information content similarity measures within our system.
Overall, the results show our system is out-performed only by systems utilizing training data or substantially more annotated data.
