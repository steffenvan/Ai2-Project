<newSection> Abstract This paper describes a principled approach for analyzing relations between constituent words of compound nouns whose heads are deverbal nouns.
To develop an analyzer for the compound nouns with deverbal heads is an essential element of developing of a general compound analyzer, as they constitute a major part of the compound nouns.
Our approach is based on the classification of deverbal nouns by their lexical conceptual structure (LCS) and the classification of nouns in general (to appear in the modifier position) vis-Ã -vis a few core LCS types (of head deverbal nouns).
The experimental evaluation based on compound nouns with deverbal heads showed that over 99% of the compounds were accurately analyzed.
The result of the experiment indicates that our approach is very promising.
