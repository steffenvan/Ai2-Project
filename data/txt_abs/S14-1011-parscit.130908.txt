<newSection> Abstract The aim of this paper is to discuss difficulties involved in adopting an existing system of semantic roles in a grammar engineering task.
Two typical repertoires of semantic roles are considered, namely, VerbNet and Sowaâ€™s system.
We report on experiments showing the low inter-annotator agreement when using such systems and suggest that, at least in case of languages with rich morphosyntax, an approximation of semantic roles derived from syntactic (grammatical functions) and morphosyntactic (grammatical cases) features of arguments may actually be beneficial for applications such as textual entailment.
