<newSection> Abstract It is shown that the behaviour of test persons as observed in association experiments can be simulated statistically on the basis of the common occurrences of words in large text corpora, thereby applying the law of association by contiguity which is well known from psychological learning theory.
In particular, the focus of this work is on the prediction of the word associations as obtained from subjects on presentation of multiword stimuli.
Results are presented for applications as diverse as crossword puzzle solving and the identification of word translations based on non-parallel texts.
