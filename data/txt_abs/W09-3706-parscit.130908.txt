<newSection> Abstract This paper presents a new perspective on the use of semantic annotations.
We argue that semantic annotations should (1) capture semantic information that is complimentary to the information that is expressed in the source text; (2) have a formal interpretation.
If these conditions are fullfilled, then the information in semantic annotations can be effectively combined with the information in the source text by interpreting a semantic annotation language through the translation of annotations into the same formalism as underspecified semantic representations obtained through compositional semantic analysis.
