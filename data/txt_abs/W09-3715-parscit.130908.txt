<newSection> Abstract The literature contains a wealth of theoretical and empirical analyses of discourse marker functions in human communication.
Some of these studies address the phenomenon that discourse markers are often multifunctional in a given context, but do not study this in systematic and formal ways.
In this paper we show that the use of multiple dimensions in distinguishing and annotating semantic units supports a more accurate analysis of the meaning of discourse markers.
We present an empirically-based analysis of the semantic functions of discourse markers in dialogue.
We demonstrate that the multiple functions, which a discourse marker may have, are automatically recognizable from utterance surface-features using machine-learning techniques.
