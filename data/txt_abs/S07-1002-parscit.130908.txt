<newSection> Abstract The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrimination systems, and also to compare these systems to other supervised and knowledge-based systems.
In total there were 6 participating systems.
We reused the SemEval2007 English lexical sample subtask of task 17, and set up both clustering-style unsupervised evaluation (using OntoNotes senses as gold-standard) and a supervised evaluation (using the part of the dataset for mapping).
We provide a comparison to the results of the systems participating in the lexical sample subtask of task 17.
