<newSection> Abstract This paper presents our first attempt at constructing a Vietnamese-French statistical machine translation system.
Since Vietnamese is an under-resourced language, we concentrate on building a large Vietnamese-French parallel corpus.
A document alignment method based on publication date, special words and sentence alignment result is proposed.
The paper also presents an application of the obtained parallel corpus to the construction of a Vietnamese-French statistical machine translation system, where the use of different units for Vietnamese (syllables, words, or their combinations) is discussed.
