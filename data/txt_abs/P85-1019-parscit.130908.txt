<newSection> Abstract We have implemented a restricted domain parser called Plume.
7&quot; Building on previous work at Carnegie-Mellon University e.g. [4. 5, 91, Plume s approacri to parsing IS based on semantic caseframe Instantiation This nas the advantages of efficiency on grammatical Input, and robustness in the face of ungrammatical input While Plume is well adapted to simple declarative and imperative utterances, it handles passives relative clauses and interrogatives in an ad hoc manner leading to patchy syntactic coverage This paper outlines Plume as it currently exists and describes our detailed design for extending Plume to handle passives relative clauses, and interrogatives in a general manner
