<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we introduce a generic approach to elliptic coordination modeling through the parsing of Ltag grammars.
We show that erased lexical items can be replaced during parsing by informations gathered in the other member of the coordinate structure and used as a guide at the derivation level.
Moreover, we show how this approach can be indeed implemented as a light extension of the LTAG formalism throuh a so-called “fusion” operation and by the use of tree schemata during parsing in order to obtain a dependency graph.
