<newSection> Abstract RWTH participated in the shared translation task of the Fourth Workshop of Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2009) with the German-English, French-English and Spanish-English pair in each translation direction.
The submissions were generated using a phrase-based and a hierarchical statistical machine translation systems with appropriate morpho-syntactic enhancements.
POS-based reorderings of the source language for the phrase-based systems and splitting of German compounds for both systems were applied.
For some tasks, a system combination was used to generate a final hypothesis.
An additional English hypothesis was produced by combining all three final systems for translation into English.
