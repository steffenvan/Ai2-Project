<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the embedding of a statistical translation system within a text editor to produce TRANSTYPE, a system that watches over the user as he or she types a translation and repeatedly suggests completions for the text already entered.
This innovative Embedded Machine Translation system is thus a specialized means of helping produce high quality translations.
