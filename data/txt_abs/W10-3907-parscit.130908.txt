<newSection> Abstract We analyzed the details of a Web-derived distributional data of Japanese nominal terms with two aims.
One aim is to examine if distributionally similar terms can be in fact equated with “semantically similar” terms, and if so to what extent.
The other is to investigate into what kind of semantic relations constitute (strongly) distributionally similar terms.
Our results show that over 85% of the pairs of the terms derived from the highly similar terms turned out to be semantically similar in some way.
The ratio of “classmate,” synonymous, hypernym-hyponym, and meronymic relations are about 62%, 17%, 8% and 1% of the classified data, respectively.
