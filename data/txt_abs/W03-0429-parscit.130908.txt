<newSection> Abstract We present an approach to named entity recognition that uses support vector machines to capture transition probabilities in a lattice.
The support vector machines are trained with hundreds of thousands of features drawn from the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task training data.
Margin outputs are converted to estimated probabilities using a simple static function.
Performance is evaluated using the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task test set; Test B results were Fβ=1 = 84.67 for English, and Fβ=1 = 69.96 for German.
