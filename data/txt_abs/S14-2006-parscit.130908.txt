<newSection> Abstract SemEval-2014 Task 6 aims to advance semantic parsing research by providing a high-quality annotated dataset to compare and evaluate approaches.
The task focuses on contextual parsing of robotic commands, in which the additional context of spatial scenes can be used to guide a parser to control a robot arm.
Six teams submitted systems using both rule-based and statistical methods.
The best performing (hybrid) system scored 92.5% and 90.5% for parsing with and without spatial context.
However, the best performing statistical system scored 87.35% and 60.84% respectively, indicating that generalized understanding of commands given to a robot remains challenging, despite the fixed domain used for the task.
