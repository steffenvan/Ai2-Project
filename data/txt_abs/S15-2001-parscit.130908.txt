<newSection> Abstract In this shared task, we present evaluations on two related tasks Paraphrase Identification (PI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (SS) systems for the Twitter data.
Given a pair of sentences, participants are asked to produce a binary yes/no judgement or a graded score to measure their semantic equivalence.
The task features a newly constructed Twitter Paraphrase Corpus that contains 18,762 sentence pairs.
A total of 19 teams participated, submitting 36 runs to the PI task and 26 runs to the SS task.
The evaluation shows encouraging results and open challenges for future research.
The best systems scored a F1-measure of 0.674 for the PI task and a Pearson correlation of 0.619 for the SS task respectively, comparing to a strong baseline using logistic regression model of 0.589 F1 and 0.511 Pearson; while the best SS systems can often reach >0.80 Pearson on well-formed text.
This shared task also provides insights into the relation between the PI and SS tasks and suggests the importance to bringing these two research areas together.
We make all the data, baseline systems and evaluation scripts publicly available.1
