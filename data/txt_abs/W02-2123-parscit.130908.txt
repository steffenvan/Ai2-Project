<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present an architecture for generating texts that vary in the emphasis put on conciseness, readability and the marking of particularly salient items.
We abandon the traditional pipeline architecture, and use an integrated approach which makes the search for an optimum text explicit, taking into account both inter-sentential and intra-sentential features.
We describe a context sensitive scoring system which can relate surface properties to a deeper representational level.
We show how this approach can be used in generating paragraph length texts, optimised against various criteria.
