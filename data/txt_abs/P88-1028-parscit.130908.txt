<newSection> ABSTRACT We apply a complexity theoretic notion of feasible learnability called &quot;polynomial learnability&quot; to the evaluation of grammatical formalisms for linguistic description.
We show that a novel, nontrivial constraint on the degree of &quot;locality&quot; of grammars allows not only context free languages but also a rich class of mildy context sensitive languages to be polynomially learnable.
We discuss possible implications of this result to the theory of natural language acquisition.
