<newSection> Abstract We present a general model for PP attachment resolution and NP analysis in French.
We make explicit the different assumptions our model relies on, and show how it generalizes previously proposed models.
We then present a series of experiments conducted on a corpus of newspaper articles, and assess the various components of the model, as well as the different information sources used.
