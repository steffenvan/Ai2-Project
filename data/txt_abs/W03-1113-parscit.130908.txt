<newSection> Abstract Though dynamic programming matching can carry out approximate string matching when there may be deletions or insertions in a document, its effectiveness and efficiency are usually too poor to use it for large-scale information retrieval.
In this paper, we propose a method of dynamic programming matching for information retrieval.
This method is as effective as a conventional information retrieval system, even though it is capable of approximate matching.
It is also as efficient as a conventional system.
