<newSection> Abstract As spoken dialogue systems move beyond task oriented dialogues and become distributed in the pervasive computing environments, their growing complexity calls for more modular structures.
When different aspects of a single system can be accessed with different interfaces, knowledge representation and separation of low level interaction modeling from high level reasoning on domain level becomes important.
In this paper, a model utilizing a dialogue plan to communicate information from domain level planner to dialogue management and from there to a separate mobile interface is presented.
The model enables each part of the system handle the same information from their own perspectives without containing overlapping logic.
