<newSection> Abstract The prevalence in Chinese of grammatical structures that translate into English in different word orders is an important cause of translation difficulty.
While previous work has used phrase-structure parses to deal with such ordering problems, we introduce a richer set of Chinese grammatical relations that describes more semantically abstract relations between words.
Using these Chinese grammatical relations, we improve a phrase orientation classifier (introduced by Zens and Ney (2006)) that decides the ordering of two phrases when translated into English by adding path features designed over the Chinese typed dependencies.
We then apply the log probability of the phrase orientation classifier as an extra feature in a phrase-based MT system, and get significant BLEU point gains on three test sets: MT02 (+0.59), MT03 (+1.00) and MT05 (+0.77).
Our Chinese grammatical relations are also likely to be useful for other NLP tasks.
