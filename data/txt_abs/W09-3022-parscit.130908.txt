<newSection> Abstract In this short paper, we present annotations for tagging grammatical and stylistic errors, together with attributes about the nature of the correction which are then interpreted as arguments.
A decision model is introduced in order for the author to be able to decide on the best correction to make.
This introduces an operational semantics for tags and related attributes.
