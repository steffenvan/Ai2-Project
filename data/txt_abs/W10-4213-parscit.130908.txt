<newSection> Abstract We present a framework for reformulating sentences by applying transfer rules on a typed dependency representation.
We specify a list of operations that the framework needs to support and argue that typed dependency structures are currently the most suitable formalism for complex lexico-syntactic paraphrasing.
We demonstrate our approach by reformulating sentences expressing the discourse relation of causation using four lexico-syntactic discourse markers – “cause” as a verb and as a noun, “because” as a conjunction and “because of” as a preposition.
