The cognitive status of coherence relations: their role in text processing Does any experimental evidence exist for the claim that.
coherence relations are cognitive entities?
It can be concluded from a review of experimental literature on the relation between text structure and text processing that two findings are relevant: 1) different text structures lead to differences in text understanding and 2) linguistic marking of text structure influences text processing.
In an attempt to overcome some of the difficulties found in the overview, a reading experiment. was conducted, in which two aspects of the structure of expository texts were manipulated: The type of coherence relation between two segments (Problem-Solution versus List) and the linguistic marking of these relations (implicit versus explicit) (Sanders, 1992, chapter 4).
Reading times per sentence were collected, subjects verified statements with regard to the text and they were given a free recall task.
13o1h factors appeared to influence text processing.
Problem-Solution relations lead to faster processing, better verification and more reproduced information.
Explicit marking of the relations resulted in faster processing, but did not affect verification, nor the amount of reproduced information.
These results show that the processing of a text segment depends on the relation it has with a preceding segment.
Although the results should still be interpreted with some care, they suggest that the role of the relational marker is restricted to text processing; contrary to the coherence relation, which is an indissoluble part of the representation, the linguistic marking does not affect the recall of the information.
