<newSection> 2.4 EXPLANATION A discourse unit similar to planning is explanation.
(Weiner, 1979;Goguen, Linde and Weiner to appear.)
(By explanation we here include only the discourse unit of the form described below; we exclude discourse units such as narratives or question-response pairs which may socially serve the function of explanation.)
Informally, explanation is that discourse unit which consists of a proposition to be demonstrated, and a structure of reasons, often multiply embedded reasons, which support it.
The data of this study are accounts given of the choice to use the long or short income tax form, explanations of career choices, and material from the Watergate transcripts in which an evaluation is given of how likely a plan is to succeed, with complex reasons for this evaluation.
Like apartment descriptions and small group planning, explanation can be described as the transformational construction of a tree structure.
Since in the casesexamined, a single person builds the explanation, there are no reconstructive transformations such as deletion or movement of subtrees; the transformations found are addition and pointer movement.
Pointer movement is particularly complex in this discourse unit since explanation permits embedded alternate worlds, which require multiple pointers to be maintained.
Explanation structure appears to be the same in the three different semantic domains, suggesting that the discourse structure is due to genral rules plus a particular social context, rather than being due to the structure of the semantic domain.
