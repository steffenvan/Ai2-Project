<newSection> Abstract Character-based tagging method has achieved great success in Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS).
This paper proposes a new approach to improve the CWS tagging accuracy by combining Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with structured support vector machine (SVM) for utilization of enormous unlabeled text corpus.
First, character N-grams are clustered and mapped into a low-dimensional space by adopting SOM algorithm.
Two different maps are built based on the N-gramâ€™s preceding and succeeding context respectively.
Then new features are extracted from these maps and integrated into the structured SVM methods for CWS.
Experimental results on Bakeoff-2005 database show that SOM-based features can contribute more than 7% relative error reduction, and the structured SVM method for CWS proposed in this paper also outperforms traditional conditional random field (CRF) method.
