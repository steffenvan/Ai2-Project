<newSection> Abstract A new hybrid approach to the coreference resolution problem is presented.
The COR,UDIS system (COreference R,Ules with Disambiguation Statistics) combines syntactico-semantic rules with statistics derived from an annotated corpus.
First, the rules and corpus annotations are described and exemplified.
Then, the coreference resolution algorithm and the involved statistics are explained.
Finally, the proposed method is evaluated against a baseline model and some directions for further research are indicated.
