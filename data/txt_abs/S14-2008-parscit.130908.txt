<newSection> Abstract Task 8 at SemEval 2014 defines Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP) as the problem of recovering sentence-internal predicateâ€“argument relationships for all content words, i.e. the semantic structure constituting the relational core of sentence meaning.
In this task description, we position the problem in comparison to other sub-tasks in computational language analysis, introduce the semantic dependency target representations used, reflect on high-level commonalities and differences between these representations, and summarize the task setup, participating systems, and main results.
