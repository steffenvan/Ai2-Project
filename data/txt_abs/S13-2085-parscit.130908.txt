<newSection> Abstract For SemEval-2013 Task 2, A and B (Sentiment Analysis in Twitter), we use a rule-based pattern matching system that is based on an existing ‘Domain Independent’ sentiment taxonomy for English, essentially a highly phrasal sentiment lexicon.
We have made some modifications to our set of rules, based on what we found in the annotated training data that was made available for the task.
The resulting system scores competitively, especially on task B.
