<newSection> Abstract In this paper we present our system participating in the SemEval-2014 Task 7 in both subtasks A and B, aiming at recognizing and normalizing disease and symptom mentions from electronic medical records respectively.
In subtask A, we used an existing NER system, NERsuite, with our own feature set tailored for this task.
For subtask B, we combined word vector representations and supervised machine learning to map the recognized mentions to the corresponding UMLS concepts.
Our system was placed 2nd and 5th out of 21 participants on subtasks A and B respectively showing competitive performance.
