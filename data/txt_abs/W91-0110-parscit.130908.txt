<newSection> Abstract We present a uniform computational architecture for developing reversible grammars for parsing and generation, and for bidirectional transfer in MT.
We sketch the principles of a general reversible architecture and show how they are realized in the rewriting system for typed feature structures developed at the University of Stuttgart.
The reversibility of parsing and generation, and the bidirectionality of transfer rules fall out of general properties of the uniform architecture.
