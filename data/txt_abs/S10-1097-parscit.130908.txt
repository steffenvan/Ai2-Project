<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we describe our system which participated in the SemEval 2010 task of disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives for Chinese.
Our system uses text messages from Twitter, a popular microblogging platform, for building a dataset of emotional texts.
Using the built dataset, the system classifies the meaning of adjectives into positive or negative sentiment polarity according to the given context.
Our approach is fully automatic.
It does not require any additional hand-built language resources and it is language independent.
