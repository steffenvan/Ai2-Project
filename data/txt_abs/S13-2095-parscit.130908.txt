<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the NILC USP system that participated in SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.
Our system adopts a hybrid classification process that uses three classification approaches: rule-based, lexicon-based and machine learning approaches.
We suggest a pipeline architecture that extracts the best characteristics from each classifier.
Our system achieved an Fscore of 56.31% in the Twitter message-level subtask.
