<newSection> Abstract The aim of this paper is to present a language-neutral, theory-neutral method for annotating sentence-internal temporal relations.
The annotation method is simple and can be applied without special training.
The annotations are provided with a well-defined model-theoretic interpretation for use in the content-based comparison of annotations.
Temporally annotated corpora have a number of applications, in lexicon/induction, translation and linguistic investigation.
A searchable multi-language database has already been created.
