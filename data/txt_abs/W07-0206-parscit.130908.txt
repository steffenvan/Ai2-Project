<newSection> Abstract We extend the Blum and Chawla (2001) graph min-cut algorithm to structured problems.
This extension can alternatively be viewed as a joint inference method over a set of training and test instances where parts of the instances interact through a prespecified associative network.
The method has has an efficient approximation through a linear-programming relaxation.
On small training data sets, the method achieves up to 34.8% relative error reduction.
