<newSection> Abstract We describe a proposal for an extensible, component-based software architecture for natural language engineering applications.
Our model leverages existing linguistic resource description and discovery mechanisms based on extended Dublin Core metadata.
In addition, application design is flexible, allowing disparate components to be combined to suit the overall application functionality.
An application specification language provides abstraction from the programming environment and allows ease of interface with computational grids via a broker.
