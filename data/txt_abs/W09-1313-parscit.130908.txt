<newSection> 1 Introduction Proteins and genes are the most important entities in molecular biology, and their automated recognition in text is the most widely studied task in biomedical information extraction (IE).
Several corpora containing annotation for these entities have been introduced, GENIA (Kim et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008) and GENETAG (Tanabe et al., 2005) being the most prominent and widely applied.
While both aim to address protein/gene annotation, their annotation principles differ notably.
One key difference is that GENETAG annotates the conceptual entity, gene, which is often associated with a function, while GENIA concentrates on the physical forms of gene, i.e. protein, DNA and RNA.
The difference has caused serious problems relating to the compatibility and comparability of the annotations.
In this work, we present an extension of GENIA annotation which integrates GENETAG-style gene annotation.
The new version of the GENIA corpus is the first to bring together these two types of entity annotation.
