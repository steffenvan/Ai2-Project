<newSection> Abstract We present the ADAMACH data centric dialog system, that allows to perform on- and offline mining of dialog context, speech recognition results and other system-generated representations, both within and across dialogs.
The architecture implements a “fat pipeline” for speech and language processing.
We detail how the approach integrates domain knowledge and evolving empirical data, based on a user study in the University Helpdesk domain.
