<newSection> Abstract We describe a concept-based summarization system for biomedical documents and show that its performance can be improved using Word Sense Disambiguation.
The system represents the documents as graphs formed from concepts and relations from the UMLS.
A degree-based clustering algorithm is applied to these graphs to discover different themes or topics within the document.
To create the graphs, the MetaMap program is used to map the text onto concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus.
This paper shows that applying a graph-based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm to the output of MetaMap improves the quality of the summaries that are generated.
