<newSection> Abstract OMNIA is an on-going project that aims to retrieve images accompanied with multilingual texts.
In this paper, we propose a generic method (language and domain independent) to extract conceptual information from such texts and spontaneous user requests.
First, texts are labelled with interlingual annotation, then a generic extractor taking a domain ontology as a parameter extract relevant conceptual information.
Implementation is also presented with a first experiment and preliminary results.
