<newSection> Abstract This paper describes an initial version of a general purpose French/English statistical machine translation system.
The main features of this system are the open-source Moses decoder, the integration of a bilingual dictionary and a continuous space target language model.
We analyze the performance of this system on the test data of the WMTâ€™08 evaluation.
