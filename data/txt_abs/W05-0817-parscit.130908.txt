<newSection> Abstract We briefly describe a word alignment system that combines two different methods in bitext correspondences identification.
The first one is a hypotheses testing approach (Gale and Church, 1991; Melamed, 2001; Tufi$ 2002) while the second one is closer to a model estimating approach (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2000).
We show that combining the two aligners the results are significantly improved as compared to each individual aligner.
