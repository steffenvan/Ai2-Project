<newSection> Abstract Our group participated in the Basque and English lexical sample tasks in Senseval-3.
A language-specific feature set was defined for Basque.
Four different learning algorithms were applied, and also a method that combined their outputs.
Before submission, the performance of the methods was tested for each task on the Senseval-3 training data using cross validation.
Finally, two systems were submitted for each language: the best single algorithm and the best ensemble.
