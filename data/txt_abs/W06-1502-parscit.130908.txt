<newSection> Abstract We present an operational framework allowing to express a large scale Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) by using higher level operational constraints on tree descriptions.
These constraints first meant to guarantee the well formedness of the grammatical units may also be viewed as a way to put model theoretic syntax at work through an efficient offline grammatical compilation process.
Our strategy preserves TAG formal properties, hence ensures a reasonable processing efficiency.
