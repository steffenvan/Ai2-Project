<newSection> Abstract This paper describes the Duluth systems that participated in Task 2 of SemEvalâ€“2012.
These systems were unsupervised and relied on variations of the Gloss Vector measure found in the freely available software package WordNet::Similarity.
This method was moderately successful for the Class-Inclusion, Similar, Contrast, and Non-Attribute categories of semantic relations, but mimicked a random baseline for the other six categories.
