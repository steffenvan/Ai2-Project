<newSection> Abstract This paper presents an original WSD method, based on a mixture of three algorithms working on the local context of target units.
The results on the task    () of Senseval 3 were 60.3% of precision and recall for the T sub-task, and 64.1% for TS.
We attempted to improve the method by constituting synonym-like classes from an English-French aligned corpus, but without any gain in the results.
