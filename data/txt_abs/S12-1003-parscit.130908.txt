<newSection> Abstract This paper explores the hypothesis that semantic relatedness may be more reliably inferred by using a multilingual space, as compared to the typical monolingual representation.
Through evaluations using several state-of-the-art semantic relatedness systems, applied on standard datasets, we show that a multilingual approach is better suited for this task, and leads to improvements of up to 47% with respect to the monolingual baseline.
