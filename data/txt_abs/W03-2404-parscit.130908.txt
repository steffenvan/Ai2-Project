<newSection> Abstract This paper reports on the conversion of the TIGER treebank, a syntactically interpreted corpus of German newspaper texts, into a testsuite for a broad-coverage Lexical-Functional Gram mar (LFG) for German.
This is done by first converting the TIGER XML representation into a relational Prolog-like representation and then applying term-rewriting rules as they are used in certain MT transfer components to that representation.
The output consists of (partly underspecified) f-structures, which can then be mapped against the grammar's output for evaluation purposes.
