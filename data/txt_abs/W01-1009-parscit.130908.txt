<newSection> Abstract Although vast amounts of information are available electronically today, no effective information access mechanism exists to provide humans with convenient information access.
A general, open-domain question answering system is a solution to this problem.
We propose an architecture for a collaborative question answering system that contains four primary components: an annotations system for storing knowledge, a ternary expression representation of language, a transformational rule system for handling some complexities of language, and a collaborative mechanism by which ordinary users can contribute new knowledge by teaching the system new information.
We have developed a initial prototype, called Webnotator, with which to test these ideas.
