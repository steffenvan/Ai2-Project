<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we describe HeidelTime, a system for the extraction and normalization of temporal expressions.
HeidelTime is a rule-based system mainly using regular expression patterns for the extraction of temporal expressions and knowledge resources as well as linguistic clues for their normalization.
In the TempEval-2 challenge, HeidelTime achieved the highest FScore (86%) for the extraction and the best results in assigning the correct value attribute, i.e., in understanding the semantics of the temporal expressions.
