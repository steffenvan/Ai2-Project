<newSection> Abstract Integrating rules and statistical systems is a challenge often faced by natural language processing system builders.
A common subclass is integrating high precision rules with a Markov statistical sequence classifier.
In this paper we suggest that using such rules to constrain the sequence classifier decoder results in superior accuracy and efficiency.
In a case study of a named entity tagging system, we provide evidence that this method of combination does prove efficient than other methods.
The accuracy was the same.
