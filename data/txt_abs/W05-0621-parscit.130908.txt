<newSection> Abstract In this paper, we propose an approach for inferring semantic role using subcategorization frames and maximum entropy model.
Our approach aims to use the sub-categorization information of the verb to label the mandatory arguments of the verb in various possible ways.
The ambiguity between the assignment of roles to mandatory arguments is resolved using the maximum entropy model.
The unlabelled mandatory arguments and the optional arguments are labelled directly using the maximum entropy model such that their labels are not one among the frame elements of the sub-categorization frame used.
Maximum entropy model is preferred because of its novel approach of smoothing.
Using this approach, we obtained an F-measure of 68.14% on the development set of the data provided for the CONLL-2005 shared task.
We show that this approach performs well in comparison to an approach which uses only the maximum entropy model.
