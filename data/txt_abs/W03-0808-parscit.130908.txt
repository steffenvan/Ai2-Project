<newSection> Abstract Information extraction (IE) systems assist analysts to assimilate information from electronic documents.
This paper focuses on IE tasks designed to support information discovery applications.
Since information discovery implies examining large volumes of documents drawn from various sources for situations that cannot be anticipated a priori, they require IE systems to have breadth as well as depth.
This implies the need for a domain-independent IE system that can easily be customized for specific domains: end users must be given tools to customize the system on their own.
It also implies the need for defining new intermediate level IE tasks that are richer than the subject-verb-object (SVO) triples produced by shallow systems, yet not as complex as the domain-specific scenarios defined by the Message Understanding Conference (MUC).
This paper describes a robust, scalable IE engine designed for such purposes.
It describes new IE tasks such as entity profiles, and concept-based general events which represent realistic goals in terms of what can be accomplished in the near-term as well as providing useful, actionable information.
These new tasks also facilitate the correlation of output from an IE engine with existing structured data.
Benchmarking results for the core engine and applications utilizing the engine are presented.
