<newSection> Introduction to *SEM 2013 Building on the momentum generated by the spectacular success of the Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM) in 2012, bringing together the ACL SIGLEX and ACL SIGSEM communities, we are delighted to bring to you the second edition of the conference, as a top-tier showcase of the latest research in computational semantics.
We accepted 14 papers (11 long and 3 short) for publication at the conference, out of a possible 45 submissions (a 31% acceptance rate).
This is on par with some of the most competitive conferences in computational linguistics, and we are confident will set the stage for a scintillating conference.
This year, we started a tradition that we intend to maintain in all future iterations of the conference in integrating a shared task into the conference.
The shared task was selected by an independent committee comprising members from SIGLEX and SIGSEM, based on an open call for proposals, and revolved around Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).
The task turned out to be a huge success with 34 teams participating, submitting a total of 103 system runs.
iii As always, *SEM 2013 would not have been possible without the considerable efforts of our area chairs and an impressive assortment of reviewers, drawn from the ranks of SIGLEX and SIGSEM, and the computational semantics community at large.
We would also like to acknowledge the generous support for the STS Task from the DARPA Deft Program.
We hope you enjoy *SEM 2013, and look forward to engaging with all of you,
