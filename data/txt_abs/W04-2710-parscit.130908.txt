<newSection> Abstract High-quality lexical resources are needed to both train and evaluate Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems.
The problem of ambiguity persists even in limited domains, thus the necessity for wide-coverage inventories of senses (dictionaries) and corpora sense-tagged to them.
WordNet has been used extensively for WSD, for both its broad coverage and its large network of semantic relations.
In this paper, we present a report on the state of our current endeavor to increase the connectivity of WordNet through sense-tagging the glosses, the result of which will be to create a more integrated lexical resource.
