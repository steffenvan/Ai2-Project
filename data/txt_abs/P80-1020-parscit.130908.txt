<newSection> INTRODUCTION A computerized conference (CC) is a form of communication in which participants type into and read from a computer terminal.
The participants may be on line at the same time--termed a &quot;synchrononous&quot; conference, or may interact asynchronously.
The conversation is stored and mediated by the computer.
Row does this form of communication change the process and outcome of group discussions, as compared to the &quot;normal&quot; face to face (FtF) medium of group discussion, where participants communicate by talking, listening and observing non-verbal behavior, and where there is no lag between the sending and receipt of communication signals?
This paper briefly summarizes the results of a controlled laboratory experiment designed to quantify the manner in which conversation and group decision making varies between FtF and CC.
Those who wish more detail are referred to the literature review which served as the basis for the design of the experiment (Hilts, 1975) and to the full technical report on the results (Hiltz, Johnson, Aronovitch, and Turoff, 1980).
This paper is excerpted from a longer paper on the analysis of communications process in the two media and their correlates (Hiltz, Johnson and Rabke, 1980).
