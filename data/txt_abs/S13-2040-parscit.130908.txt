<newSection> Abstract This paper presents the SemEval-2013 task on multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation.
We describe our experience in producing a multilingual sense-annotated corpus for the task.
The corpus is tagged with BabelNet 1.1.1, a freely-available multilingual encyclopedic dictionary and, as a byproduct, WordNet 3.0 and the Wikipedia sense inventory.
We present and analyze the results of participating systems, and discuss future directions.
