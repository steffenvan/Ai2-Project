<newSection> Abstract Multilingual generation is becoming an increasingly important aspect of implemented systems that showcase the abilities of generation systems.
Most such systems require multiple grammars, one for each language which must be deployed.
Yet little is known about the development costs for additional languages which are developed not from scratch, but by adapting existing resources.
We ported a standard English surface realizer and grammar with wide coverage to Italian.
After describing major grammatical differences, we quantitatively specify the porting process and present statistical information for the changes we found necessary to develop the new grammar.
