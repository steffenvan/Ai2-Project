Abstract
Information Extraction (1E) systems are commonly based on pattern matching. Adapting
an IE system to a new scenario entails the
construction of a new pattern base—a timeconsuming and expensive process. We have
implemented a system for finding patterns automatically from un-annotated text. Starting
with a small initial set of seed patterns proposed
by the user, the system applies an incremental
discovery procedure to identify new patterns.
We present experiments with evaluations which
show that the resulting patterns exhibit high
precision and recall.
0 Introduction
The task of Information Extraction (1E) is
the selective extraction of meaning from free
natural language text.1 &quot;Meaning&quot; is understood here in terms of a fixed set of semantic
objects—entities, relationships among entities,
and events in which entities participate. The
semantic objects belong to a small number of
types, all having fixed regular structure, within
a fixed and closely circumscribed subject domain. The extracted objects are then stored in
a relational database. In this paper, we use the
nomenclature accepted in current IE literature;
the term subject domain denotes a class of textual documents to be processed, e.g., &quot;business
news,&quot; and scenario denotes the specific topic
of interest within the domain, i.e., the set of
facts to be extracted. One example of a scenario is &quot;management succession,&quot; the topic of
MUC-6 (the Sixth Message Understanding Conference); in this scenario the system seeks to
identify events in which corporate managers left

1997; muc, 1995; muc, 1993).
their posts or assumed new ones. We will consider this scenario in detail in a later section
describing experiments.
IE systems today are commonly based on pattern matching. The patterns are regular expressions, stored in a &quot;pattern base&quot; containing
a general-purpose component and a substantial
domain- and scenario-specific component.
Portability and performance are two major
problem areas which are recognized as impeding widespread use of IE. This paper presents a
novel approach, which addresses both of these
problems by automatically discovering good
patterns for a new scenario. The viability of
our approach is tested and evaluated with an
actual IE system.
In the next section we describe the problem in
more detail in the context of our IE system; sections 2 and 3 describe our algorithm for pattern
discovery; section 4 describes our experimental
results, followed by comparison with prior work
and discussion, in section 5.
1 The IE System
Our IE system, among others, contains a a backend core engine, at the heart of which is a
regular-expression pattern matcher. The engine
draws on attendant knowledge bases (KBs) of
varying degrees of domain-specificity. The KB
components are commonly factored out to make
the systems portable to new scenarios. There
are four customizable knowledge bases in our IE
system: the Lexicon contains general dictionaries and scenario-specific terms; the concept base
groups terms into classes; the predicate base describes the logical structure of events to be extracted, and the pattern base contains patterns
that catch the events in text.
Each KB has a. substantial domain-specific
component, which must be modified when mov

ing to new domains and scenarios. The system
allows the user (i.e. scenario developer) to start
with example sentences in text which contain
events of interest, the candidates, and generalize them into patterns. However, the user is
ultimately responsible for finding all the candidates, which amounts to manually processing
example sentences in a very large training corpus. Should s/he fail to provide an example
of a particular class of syntactic/semantic construction, the system has no hope of recovering
the corresponding events. Our experience has
shown that (1) the process of discovering candidates is highly expensive, and (2) gaps in patterns directly translate into gaps in coverage.
How can the system help automate the process of discovering new good candidates? The
system should find examples of all common linguistic constructs relevant to a scenario. While
there has been prior research on identifying the
primary lexical patterns of a sub-language or
corpus (Grishman et al., 1986; Riloff, 1996), the
task here is more complex, since we are typically not provided in advance with a sub-corpus
of relevant passages; these passages must themselves be found as part of the discovery process.
The difficulty is that one of the best indications
of the relevance of the passages is precisely the
presence of these constructs. Because of this
circularity, we propose to acquire the constructs
and passages in tandem.
2 Solution
We outline our procedure for automatic acquisition of patterns; details are elaborated in
later sections. The procedure is unsupervised
in that it does not require the training corpus
to be manually annotated with events of interest, nor a pre-classified corpus with relevance
judgements, nor any feedback or intervention
from the user2. The idea is to combine IR-style
document selection with an iterative relaxation
process; this is similar to techniques used elsewhere in NLP, and is inspired in large part, if
remotely, by the work of (Kay and Roscheisen,
1993) on automatic alignment of sentences and
words in a bilingual corpus. There, the reasoning was: sentences that are translations of each
2however, it may be supervised after each iteration,
where the user can answer yes/no questions to improve
the quality of the results
other are good indicators that words they contain are translation pairs; conversely, words that
are translation pairs indicate that the sentences
which contain them correspond to one another.
In our context, we observe that documents
that are relevant to the scenario will necessarily contain good patterns; conversely, good
patterns are strong indicators of relevant documents. The outline of our approach is as follows.
0. Given: (1) a large corpus of un-annotated
and un-classified documents in the domain;
(2) an initial set of trusted scenario patterns, as chosen ad hoc by the user—the
seed; as will be seen, the seed can be quite
small—two or three patterns seem to suffice. (3) an initial (possibly empty) set of
concept classes
1. The pattern set induces a binary partition
(a split) on the corpus: on any document,
either zero or more than zero patterns will
match. Thus the universe of documents, U,
is partitioned into the relevant sub-corpus,
R, vs. the non-relevant sub-corpus, R =
U — R, with respect to the given pattern
set. Actually, the documents are assigned
weights which are 1 for documents matched
by the trusted seed, and 0 otherwise.3
2. Search for new candidate patterns:
(a) Automatically convert each sentence
in the corpus, into a set of candidate
patterns.4
(b) Generalize each pattern by replacing
each lexical item which is a member of
a concept class by the class name.
(c) Working from the relevant documents,
select those patterns whose distribution is strongly correlated with other
relevant documents (i.e., much more
3R represents the trusted truth through the discovery
iterations, since it was induced by the manually-selected
seed.
4Here, for each clause in the sentence we extract a
tuple of its major roles: the head of the subject, the
verb group, the object, object complement, as described
below. This tuple is considered to be a pattern for the
present purposes of discovery; it is a skeleton for the
rich, syntactically transformed patterns our system uses
in the extraction phase.
283
densely distributed among the relevant documents than among the nonrelevant ones). The idea is to consider
those candidate patterns, p, which
meet the density, criterion:
IH n RI IRI
IH n Ul
where H = H(p) is the set of documents where p hits.
(d) Based on co-occurrence with the chosen patterns, extend the concept
classes.
3. Optional: Present the new candidates and
classes to the user for review, retaining
those relevant to the scenario.
4. The new pattern set induces a new partition on the corpus. With this pattern set,
return to step 1. Repeat the procedure until no more patterns can be added.
3 Methodology
3.1 Pre-processing: Normalization
Before applying the discovery procedure, we
subject the corpus to several stages of preprocessing. First, we apply a name recognition
module, and replace each name with a token
describing its class, e.g. C-Person, C-Company,
etc. We collapse together all numeric expressions, currency values, dates, etc., using a single
token to designate each of these classes.
3.2 Syntactic Analysis
We then apply a parser to perform syntactic
normalization to transform each clause into a
common predicate-argument structure. We use
the general-purpose dependency parser of English, based on the FDG formalism (Tapanainen
and Jarvinen, 1997) and developed by the Research Unit for Multilingual Language Technology at the University of Helsinki, and Conexor
Oy. The parser (modified to understand the
name labels attached in the previous step) is
used for reducing such variants as passive and
relative clauses to a tuple, consisting of several
elements.
1. For each claus, the first element is the subject, a &quot;semantic&quot; subject of a non-finite
sentence or agent of the passive.5
2. The second element is the verb.
3. The third element is the object, certain
object-like adverbs, subject of the passive
or subject complement6
4. The fourth element is a phrase which
refers to the object or the subject. A
typical example of such an argument is
an object complement, such as Com
pany named John Smith president. Another instance is the so-called copredicative (Nichols, 1978), in the parsing system
(Jarvinen and Tapanainen, 1997). A copredicative refers to a subject or an object,
though this distinction is typically difficult
to resolve automatically.7
Clausal tuples also contain a locative modifier,
and a temporal modifier. We used a corpus of
5,963 articles from the Wall Street Journal, randomly chosen. The parsed articles yielded a total of 250,000 clausal tuples, of which 135,000
were distinct.
3.3 Generalization and Concept Classes
Because tuples may not repeat with sufficient
frequency to obtain reliable statistics, each tuple is reduced to a set of pairs: e.g., a verbobject pair, a subject-object pair, etc. Each
pair is used as a generalized pattern during
the candidate selection stage. Once we have
identified pairs which are relevant to the scenario, we use them to construct or augment concept classes, by grouping together the missing
roles, (for example, a class of verbs which occur with a relevant subject-object pair: &quot;company {hire/fire/expel...} person&quot;). This is similar to work by several other groups which
aims to induce semantic classes through syntactic co-occurrence analysis (Riloff and Jones,
1999; Pereira et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993;
Hirschman et al., 1975), although in our case
the contexts are limited to selected patterns,
relevant to the scenario.
5E.g., &quot;John sleeps&quot;, &quot;John is appointed by
Company&quot;, &quot;I saw a dog which sleeps&quot;, &quot;She asked
John to buy a car&quot;.
SE.g., &quot;John is appointed by Company&quot;, &quot;John is the
president of Company&quot;, &quot;I saw a dog which sleeps&quot;,
Th—e—a73-i-Which I saw sleeps.
7For example, &quot;She gave us our coffee black&quot;, &quot;Company appointed John Smith as president&quot;.
284
3.4 Pattern Discovery
Here we present the results from experiments
we conducted on the MUC-6 scenario, &quot;management succession&quot;. The discovery procedure
was seeded with a small pattern set, namely:
Subject Verb Direct Object
C-Company C-Appoint C-Person
C-Person C-Resign —
Here C-Company and C-Person denote semantic classes containing named entities of the
corresponding semantic types. C-Appoint denotes a class of verbs, containing four verbs
{ appoint, elect, promote, name}; C-Resign =
{ resign, depart, quit, step-down }.
During a single iteration, we compute the
score8, L(p), for each candidate pattern p:
L(p) Pc(p) • log 11/ n RI (1)
where R denotes the relevant subset, and H =
H(p) the documents matching p, as above, and
P(p) = Lurif I • s
!Hi the conditional probability of
relevance. We further impose two support criteria: we distrust such frequent patterns where
11-/- n tfl > 411 as uninformative, and rare patterns for which if n RI < 13 as noise.9 At the
end of each iteration, the system selects the pattern with the highest score, L(p), and adds it to
the seed set. The documents which the winning
pattern hits are added to the relevant set. The
pattern search is then restarted.
3.5 Re-computation of Document
Relevance
The above is a simplification of the actual procedure, in several important respects.
Only generalized patterns are considered for
candidacy, with one or more slots filled with
wild-cards. In computing the score of the generalized pattern, we do not take into consideration all possible values of the wild-card role. We
instead constrain the wild-card to those values
which themselves in turn produce patterns with
high scores. These values then become members
of a new class, which is output in tandem with
the winning patternl°
8similarly to (Riloff, 1996)
9U denotes the universe of documents. We used a =
0.1 and )3 =2.
19The classes are currently unused by subsequent iterations; this important issue is considered in future work.
Documents are assigned relevance scores on
a scale between 0 and 1. The seed patterns
are accepted as ground truth; thus the documents they match have relevance 1. On subsequent iterations, the newly accepted patterns
are not trusted as absolutely. On iteration number i + 1, each pattern p is assigned a precision
measure, based on the relevance of the documents it matches:
1 E i(d) (2)
preci Rel
(d) IH(p) I dElf(12)
where Rel(d) is the relevance of the document
from the previous iteration, and H(p) is the set
of documents where p matched. More generally,
if K is a classifier consisting of a set of patterns,
we can define H(K) as the set of documents
where all of patterns p E K match, and the
&quot;cumulative&quot; precisionll of K as
1
E Relz(d) (3)
Preci±l(K) 1H(K dEH(K)
Once the new winning pattern is accepted,
the relevance scores of the documents are readjusted as follows. For each document d which
is matched by some (non-empty) subset of the
currently accepted patterns, we can view that
subset of patterns as a classifier Kd =
These patterns determine the new relevance
score of the document is
Reli+1(d) = max (Reli (d), Preci+1(Kd)) (4)
This ensures that the relevance score grows
monotonically, and only when there is sufficient
positive evidence, as the patterns in effect vote
&quot;conjunctively&quot; on the documents. The results
which follow use this measure.
Thus in the formulas above, R is not simply the count of the relevant documents, but
is rather their cumulative relevance. The two
formulas, (3) and (4), capture the mutual dependency of patterns and documents; this recomputation and growing of precision and relevance scores is at the heart of the procedure.
110f course, this measure is defined only when

An objective measure of goodness of a pattern
is not trivial to establish since the patterns cannot be used for extraction directly, without being properly incorporated into the knowledge
base. Thus, the discovery procedure does not
lend itself easily to MUC-style evaluations, since
a pattern lacks information about which events
it induces and which slots its arguments should
fill.
However, it is possible to apply some objective measures of performance. One way we evaluated the system is by noting that in addition
to growing the pattern set, the procedure also
grows the relevance of documents. The latter
can be objectively evaluated.
We used a test corpus of 100 MUC-6 formaltraining documents (which were included in the
main development corpus of about 6000 documents) plus another 150 documents picked at
random from the main corpus and judged by
hand. These judgements constituted the ground
truth and were used only for evaluation, (not in
the discovery procedure).
4.1 Text Filtering
Figure 1 shows the recall/precision measures
with respect to the test corpus of 250 documents, over a span of 60 generations, starting
with the seed set in table 3.4. The seed patterns matched 184 of the 5963 documents, yielding an initial recall of .11 and precision of .93;
by the last generation it searched through 982
documents with non-zero relevance, and ended
with .80 precision and .78 recall. This facet of
the discovery procedure is closely related to the
MUC &quot;text-filtering&quot; sub-task, where the systems are judged at the level of documents rather
than event slots. It is interesting to compare the
results with other MUC-6 participants, shown
anonymously in figure 2. Considering recall and
precision separately, the discovery procedure attains values comparable to those achieved by
some of the participants, all of which were either heavily-supervised or manually coded systems. It is important to bear in mind that the
discovery procedure had no benefit of training
material, or any information beyond the seed
pattern set.
Figure 1: Recall/Precision curves for Management Succession
4.2 Choice of Test Corpus
Figure 2 shows two evaluations of our discovery
procedure, tested against the original MUC-6
corpus of 100 documents, and against our test
corpus, which consists of an additional 150 documents judged manually. The two plots in the
figure show a slight difference in results, indicating that in some sense, the MUC corpus was
more &quot;random&quot;, or that our expanded corpus
was somewhat skewed in favor of more common
patterns that the system is able to find more
easily.
4.3 Choice of Evaluation Metric
The graphs shown in Figures 1 and 2 are based
on an &quot;objective&quot; measure we adopted during
the experiments. This is the same measure of
relevance used internally by the discovery procedure on each iteration (relative to the &quot;truth&quot; of
relevance scores of the previous iteration), and
is not quite the standard measure used for text
filtering in IR. According to this measure, the
system gets a score for each document based on
the relevance which it assigned to the document.
Thus if the system -assigned relevance of X percent to a relevant document, it only received X

percent on the recall score for classifying that
document correctly. Similarly, if the system assigned relevance Y to an irrelevant document,
it was penalized only for the mis-classified Y
percent on the precision score. To make our results more comparable to those of other MUC
competitors, we chose a cut-off point and force
the system to make a binary relevance decision
on each document. The cut-off of 0.5 seemed
optimal from empirical observations. Figure 3
shows a noticeable improvement in scores, when
using our continuous, &quot;objective&quot; measure, vs.
the cut-off measure, with the entire graph essentially translated to the right for a gain of almost
10 percentage points of recall.
4.4 Evaluating Patterns
Another effective, if simple, measure of performance is how many of the patterns the procedure found, and comparing them with those
used by an extraction engine which was manually constructed for the same task. Our MUC-6
system used approximately 75 clause level patterns, with 30 distinct verbal heads. In one
conservative experiment, we observed that the
discovery procedure found 17 of these verbs, or
57%. However, it also found at least 8 verbs the

manual system lacked, which seemed relevant to
the scenario:
company-bring-person- [as + officerp2
person-come- [to+ company]as + officer]
person-rejoin-company- [as + officer]
person_{ return, continue,remain,stay} -[as+ officer]
person-pursue-interest
At the risk of igniting a philosophical debate over what is or is not relevant to a scenario, we note that the first four of these verbs
are evidently essential to the scenario in the
strictest definition, since they imply changes of
post. The next three are &quot;staying&quot; verbs, and
are actually also needed, since higher-level inferences required in tracking events for long-range
merging over documents, require knowledge of
persons occupying posts, rather than only assuming or leaving them. The most curious one
is &quot;person-pursue-interest&quot;; surprisingly, it too
is useful, even in the strictest MUC sense, cf.,
(muc, 1995). Systems are judged on filling a
slot called &quot;other-organization&quot;, indicating from
or to which company the person came or went.

cate that the person left to pursue other, undisclosed interests, the knowledge of which would
relieve the system from seeking other information in order to fill this slot. This is to say that
here strict evaluation is elusive.
5 Discussion and Current Work
Some of the prior research has emphasized interactive tools to convert examples to extraction
patterns, cf. (Yangarber and Grishman, 1997),
while others have focused on methods for automatically converting a corpus annotated with•
extraction examples into such patterns (Lehnert et al., 1992; Fisher et al., 1995; Miller et
al., 1998). These methods, however, do not reduce the burden of finding the examples to annotate. With either approach, the portability
bottleneck is shifted from the problem of building patterns to that of finding good candidates.
The prior work most closely related to this
study is (Riloff, 1996), which, along with (Riloff,
1993), seeks automatic methods for filling slots
in event templates. However, the prior work
differs from that presented here in several crucial respects; firstly, the prior work does not attempt to find entire events, after the fashion
of MUC's highest-level scenario-template task.
Rather the patterns produced by those systems
identify NPs that fill individual slots, without
specifying how these slots may be combined
at a later stage into complete event templates.
The present work focuses on directly discovering
event-level, multi-slot relational patterns. Secondly, the prior work either relies on a set of
documents with relevance judgements to find
slot fillers where they are relevant to events,
(Riloff, 1996), or utilizes an un-classified corpus containing a very high proportion of relevant documents to find all instances of a semantic class, (Riloff and Jones, 1999). By contrast,
our procedure requires no relevance judgements,
and works on the assumption that the corpus is
balanced and the proportion of relevant documents is small. Classifying documents by hand,
although admittedly easier than tagging event
instances in text for automatic training, is still
a formidable task. When we prepared the test
corpus, it took 5 hours to mark 150 short documents.
The presented results indicate that our
method of corpus analysis can be used to rapidly
identify a large number of relevant patterns
without pre-classifying a large training corpus.
We are at the early stages of understanding
how to optimally tune these techniques, and
there are number of areas that need refinement.
We are working on capturing the rich information about concept classes which is currently returned as part of our pattern discovery procedure, to build up a concept dictionary in tandem
with the pattern base. We are also considering the proper selection of weights and thresholds for controlling the rankings of patterns and
documents, criteria for terminating the iteration process, and for dynamic adjustments of
these weights. We feel that the generalization
technique in pattern discovery offers a great
opportunity for combating sparseness of data,
though this requires further research. Lastly,
we are studying these algorithms under several
unrelated scenarios to determine to what extent
scenario-specific phenomena affect their performance.

et of pairs: e.g., a verbobject pair, a subject-object pair, etc. Each pair is used as a generalized pattern during the candidate selection stage. Once we have identified pairs which are relevant to the scenario, we use them to construct or augment concept classes, by grouping together the missing roles, (for example, a class of verbs which occur with a relevant subject-object pair: &quot;company {hire/fire/expel...} person&quot;). This is similar to work by several other groups which aims to induce semantic classes through syntactic co-occurrence analysis (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pereira et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993; Hirschman et al., 1975), although in our case the contexts are limited to selected patterns, relevant to the scenario. 5E.g., &quot;John sleeps&quot;, &quot;John is appointed by Company&quot;, &quot;I saw a dog which sleeps&quot;, &quot;She asked John to buy a car&quot;.

ould s/he fail to provide an example of a particular class of syntactic/semantic construction, the system has no hope of recovering the corresponding events. Our experience has shown that (1) the process of discovering candidates is highly expensive, and (2) gaps in patterns directly translate into gaps in coverage. How can the system help automate the process of discovering new good candidates? The system should find examples of all common linguistic constructs relevant to a scenario. While there has been prior research on identifying the primary lexical patterns of a sub-language or corpus (Grishman et al., 1986; Riloff, 1996), the task here is more complex, since we are typically not provided in advance with a sub-corpus of relevant passages; these passages must themselves be found as part of the discovery process. The difficulty is that one of the best indications of the relevance of the passages is precisely the presence of these constructs. Because of this circularity, we propose to acquire the constructs and passages in tandem. 2 Solution We outline our procedure for automatic acquisition of patterns; details are elaborated in later sections. The procedure is unsupervised in that it does not req

Once we have identified pairs which are relevant to the scenario, we use them to construct or augment concept classes, by grouping together the missing roles, (for example, a class of verbs which occur with a relevant subject-object pair: &quot;company {hire/fire/expel...} person&quot;). This is similar to work by several other groups which aims to induce semantic classes through syntactic co-occurrence analysis (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pereira et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993; Hirschman et al., 1975), although in our case the contexts are limited to selected patterns, relevant to the scenario. 5E.g., &quot;John sleeps&quot;, &quot;John is appointed by Company&quot;, &quot;I saw a dog which sleeps&quot;, &quot;She asked John to buy a car&quot;.

 scenario-template task. Rather the patterns produced by those systems identify NPs that fill individual slots, without specifying how these slots may be combined at a later stage into complete event templates. The present work focuses on directly discovering event-level, multi-slot relational patterns. Secondly, the prior work either relies on a set of documents with relevance judgements to find slot fillers where they are relevant to events, (Riloff, 1996), or utilizes an un-classified corpus containing a very high proportion of relevant documents to find all instances of a semantic class, (Riloff and Jones, 1999). By contrast, our procedure requires no relevance judgements, and works on the assumption that the corpus is balanced and the proportion of relevant documents is small. Classifying documents by hand, although admittedly easier than tagging event instances in text for automatic training, is still a formidable task. When we prepared the test corpus, it took 5 hours to mark 150 short documents. The presented results indicate that our method of corpus analysis can be used to rapidly identify a large number of relevant patterns without pre-classifying a large training corpus.

Only generalized patterns are considered for candidacy, with one or more slots filled with wild-cards. In computing the score of the generalized pattern, we do not take into consideration all possible values of the wild-card role. We instead constrain the wild-card to those values which themselves in turn produce patterns with high scores. These values then become members of a new class, which is output in tandem with the winning patternl° 8similarly to (Riloff, 1996) 9U denotes the universe of documents.

Documents are assigned relevance scores on a scale between 0 and 1. The seed patterns are accepted as ground truth; thus the documents they match have relevance 1. On subsequent iterations, the newly accepted patterns are not trusted as absolutely.

n Before applying the discovery procedure, we subject the corpus to several stages of preprocessing. First, we apply a name recognition module, and replace each name with a token describing its class, e.g. C-Person, C-Company, etc. We collapse together all numeric expressions, currency values, dates, etc., using a single token to designate each of these classes. 3.2 Syntactic Analysis We then apply a parser to perform syntactic normalization to transform each clause into a common predicate-argument structure. We use the general-purpose dependency parser of English, based on the FDG formalism (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997) and developed by the Research Unit for Multilingual Language Technology at the University of Helsinki, and Conexor Oy. The parser (modified to understand the name labels attached in the previous step) is used for reducing such variants as passive and relative clauses to a tuple, consisting of several elements. 1. For each claus, the first element is the subject, a &quot;semantic&quot; subject of a non-finite sentence or agent of the passive.5 2. The second element is the verb. 3. The third element is the object, certain object-like adverbs, subject of the passive or subject complement6 4. The fourth el
