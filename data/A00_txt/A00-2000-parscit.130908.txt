NAACL 2000—PREFACE
On behalf of the Program Committee for NAACL 2000, I am pleased to present you with the
papers accepted for presentation at the First Meeting of the North American Chapter of the
Association for Computational Linguistics, held in Seattle, Washington, April 29-May 4, 2000.
NAACL received a gratifyingly large number of papers from around the world. Submissions
were received from 28 countries. Reviewing was blind to all reviewers and area chairs. It was
also highly selective. Out of 166 submissions, 43 were selected for presentation at NAACL
2000.
Selecting the papers was not an easy task. In total, over 110 reviewers, representing 20 different
countries, reported to a senior program committee consisting of eight area chairs. The senior
program committee spent an intensive day at a meeting in Virginia reaching the final decisions.
The area chairs and reviewers cannot be thanked enough for the conscientious and painstaking
jobs they performed. All those who contributed are named on the following page, but I would
particularly like to express my thanks here to the area chairs: Michael Collins (AT&T Labs Research), Nancy Green (University of North Carolina at Greensboro), Graeme Hirst (University
of Toronto), Kevin Knight (USC/Information Sciences Institute), Dekang Lin (University of
Manitoba), Diane Litman (AT&T Labs - Research), Philip Resnik (University of Maryland), and
Andreas Stolcke (SRI International).
In its first year, it was advantageous to co-locate NAACL with ANLP, an established conference.
To coordinate the two conferences, submissions focusing on end-applications were invited to
ANLP 2000, while submissions focusing on methodology were invited to NAACL 2000. Future
NAACL conferences will encourage both types of submissions.
Many thanks to Marie Meteer for her outstanding service and support in her role as General
Chair.
We are extremely grateful to Linda Fresques for her work on all aspects of the process, from
managing the submissions to preparing the proceedings, and to Eli Kane for developing and
maintaining the review assignment and submission software. We also thank Lori Allen, Jacob
Feddersen, and Nayana Datta for help with the submission process. In addition, we thank the
Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University for providing significant
internal administrative and technical support.
Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to Kathy McCoy and Priscilla Rasmussen for
their consistent support and guidance, and to the ACL and NAACL Executive Committees.
Welcome to NAACL 2000!
