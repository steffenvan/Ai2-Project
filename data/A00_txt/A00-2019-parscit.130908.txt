Abstract
We present an unsupervised method for
detecting grammatical errors by inferring
negative evidence from edited textual
corpora. The system was developed and
tested using essay-length responses to
prompts on the Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL). The errorrecognition system, ALEK, performs with
about 80% precision and 20% recall.
Introduction
A good indicator of whether a person knows the
meaning of a word is the ability to use it
appropriately in a sentence (Miller and Gildea,
1987). Much information about usage can be
obtained from quite a limited context: Choueka
and Lusignan (1985) found that people can
typically recognize the intended sense of a
polysemous word by looking at a narrow
window of one or two words around it.
Statistically-based computer programs have
been able to do the same with a high level of
accuracy (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000). The goal
of our work is to automatically identify
inappropriate usage of specific vocabulary
words in essays by looking at the local
contextual cues around a target word. We have
developed a statistical system, ALEK (Assessing
Lexical Knowledge), that uses statistical
analysis for this purpose.
A major objective of this research is to avoid the
laborious and costly process of collecting errors
(or negative evidence) for each word that we
wish to evaluate. Instead, we train ALEK on a
general corpus of English and on edited text
containing example uses of the target word. The
system identifies inappropriate usage based on
differences between the word's local context
cues in an essay and the models of context it has
derived from the corpora of well-formed
sentences.
A requirement for ALEK has been that all steps
in the process be automated, beyond choosing
the words to be tested and assessing the results.
Once a target word is chosen, preprocessing,
building a model of the word's appropriate
usage, and identifying usage errors in essays is
performed without manual intervention.
ALEK has been developed using the Test of
English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)
administered by the Educational Testing
Service. TOEFL is taken by foreign students
who are applying to US undergraduate and
graduate-level programs.
1 Background
Approaches to detecting errors by non-native
writers typically produce grammars that look for
specific expected error types (Schneider and
McCoy, 1998; Park, Palmer and Washburn,
1997). Under this approach, essays written by
ESL students are collected and examined for
errors. Parsers are then adapted to identify those
error types that were found in the essay
collection.
We take a different approach, initially viewing
error detection as an extension of the word sense
disambiguation (WSD) problem. Corpus-based
WSD systems identify the intended sense of a
polysemous word by (1) collecting a set of
example sentences for each of its various senses
and (2) extracting salient contextual cues from
these sets to (3) build a statistical model for each
sense. They identify the intended sense of a
word in a novel sentence by extracting its
contextual cues and selecting the most similar
word sense model (e.g., Leacock, Chodorow and
Miller (1998), Yarowsky (1993)).
Golding (1995) showed how methods used for
WSD (decision lists and Bayesian classifiers)
could be adapted to detect errors resulting from
140
common spelling confusions among sets such as
there, their, and they're. He extracted contexts
from correct usage of each confusable word in a
training corpus and then identified a new
occurrence as an error when it matched the
wrong context.
However, most grammatical errors are not the
result of simple word confusions. This
complicates the task of building a model of
incorrect usage. One approach we considered
was to proceed without such a model: represent
appropriate word usage (across senses) in a
single model and compare a novel example to
that model. The most appealing part of this
formulation was that we could bypass the
knowledge acquisition bottleneck. All
occurrences of the word in a collection of edited
text could be automatically assigned to a single
training set representing appropriate usage.
Inappropriate usage would be signaled by
contextual cues that do not occur in training.
Unfortunately, this approach was not effective
for error detection. An example of a word usage
error is often very similar to the model of
appropriate usage. An incorrect usage can
contain two or three salient contextual elements
as well as a single anomalous element. The
problem of error detection does not entail
finding similarities to appropriate usage, rather it
requires identifying one element among the
contextual cues that simply does not fit.
2 ALEK Architecture
What kinds of anomalous elements does ALEK
identify? Writers sometimes produce errors that
violate basic principles of English syntax (e.g., a
desks), while other mistakes show a lack of
information about a specific vocabulary item
(e.g., a knowledge). In order to detect these two
types of problems, ALEK uses a 30-million
word general corpus of English from the San
Jose Mercury News (hereafter referred to as the
general corpus) and, for each target word, a set
of 10,000 example sentences from North
American newspaper text' (hereafter referred to
as the word-specific corpus).
The corpora are extracted from the ACL-DCI
corpora. In selecting the sentences for the word
ALEK infers negative evidence from the
contextual cues that do not co-occur with the
target word — either in the word specific corpus
or in the general English one. It uses two kinds
of contextual cues in a ±2 word window around
the target word: function words (closed-class
items) and part-of-speech tags (Brill, 1994). The
Brill tagger output is post-processed to &quot;enrich&quot;
some closed class categories of its tag set, such
as subject versus object pronoun and definite
versus indefinite determiner. The enriched tags
were adapted from Francis and Kaera (1982).
After the sentences have been preprocessed,
ALEK counts sequences of adjacent part-ofspeech tags and function words (such as
determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions). For
example, the sequence a/AT full-time/I. 1 jobINN
contributes one occurrence each to the bigrams
AT+JJ, JJ+NN, a+JJ, and to the part-of-speech tag
trigram AT+JJ+NN. Each individual tag and
function word also contributes to its own
unigram count. These frequencies form the basis
for the error detection measures.
From the general corpus, ALEK computes a
mutual information measure to determine which
sequences of part-of-speech tags and function
words are unusually rare and are, therefore,
likely to be ungrammatical in English (e.g.,
singular determiner preceding plural noun, as in
*a desks). Mutual information has often been
used to detect combinations of words that occur
more frequently than we would expect based on
the assumption that the words are independent.
Here we use this measure for the opposite
purpose — to find combinations that occur less
often than expected. ALEK also looks for
sequences that are common in general but
unusual in the word specific corpus (e.g., the
singular determiner a preceding a singular noun
is common in English but rare when the noun is
specific corpora, we tried to minimize the mismatch
between the domains of newspapers and TOEFL
essays. For example, in the newspaper domain,
concentrate is usually used as a noun, as in orange
juice concentrate but in TOEFL essays it is a verb
91% of the time. Sentence selection for the word
specific corpora was constrained to reflect the
distribution of part-of-speech tags for the target word
in a random sample of TOEFL essays.
141
knowledge). These divergences between the two
corpora reflect syntactic properties that are
peculiar to the target word.
2.1 Measures based on the general
corpus:
The system computes mutual information
comparing the proportion of observed
occurrences of bigrams in the general corpus to
the proportion expected based on the assumption
of independence, as shown below:
M/ log2 P (AB)
P (A) x P(B) )
Here, P(AB) is the probability of the occurrence
of the AB bigram, estimated from its frequency
in the general corpus, and P(A) and P(B) are the
probabilities of the first and second elements of
the bigram, also estimated from the general
corpus. Ungrammatical sequences should
produce bigram probabilities that are much
smaller than the product of the unigram
probabilities (the value of MI will be negative).
Trigram sequences are also used, but in this case
the mutual information computation compares
the co-occurrence of ABC to a model in which
A and C are assumed to be conditionally
independent given B (see Lin, 1998).
Ml= log2( P (ABC)
P(B) x P (AI B) x P(C I B))
Once again, a negative value is often indicative
of a sequence that violates a rule of English.
2.2 Comparing the word-specific corpus
to the general corpus:
ALEK also uses mutual information to compare
the distributions of tags and function words in
the word-specific corpus to the distributions that
are expected based on the general corpus. The
measures for bigrams and trigrams are similar to
those given above except that the probability in
the numerator is estimated from the wordspecific corpus and the probabilities in the
denominator come from the general corpus. To
return to a previous example, the phrase a
knowledge contains the tag bigram for singular
determiner followed by singular noun (AT NN).
This sequence is much less common in the
word-specific corpus for knowledge than would
be expected from the general corpus unigram
probabilities of AT and NN.
In addition to bigram and trigram measures,
ALEK compares the target word's part-ofspeech tag in the word-specific corpus and in the
general corpus. Specifically, it looks at the
conditional probability of the part-of-speech tag
given the major syntactic category (e.g., plural
noun given noun) in both distributions, by
computing the following value.
Pgeneral _corpus(tag category)
For example, in the general corpus, about half of
all noun tokens are plural, but in the training set
for the noun knowledge, the plural knowledges
occurs rarely, if at all.
The mutual information measures provide
candidate errors, but this approach overgenerates
— it finds rare, but still quite grammatical,
sequences. To reduce the number of false
positives, no candidate found by the MI
measures is considered an error if it appears in
the word-specific corpus at least two times. This
increases ALEK's precision at the price of
reduced recall. For example, a knowledge will
not be treated as an error because it appears in
the training corpus as part of the longer a
knowledge of sequence (as in a knowledge of
mathematics).
ALEK also uses another statistical technique for
finding rare and possibly ungrammatical tag and
function word bigrams by computing the x2 (chi
square) statistic for the difference between the
bigram proportions found in the word-specific
and in the general corpus:
=
2 ( (Pword specIfic— Pgeneral corpul
(log2 pspeafic _corinis(tag (category)
Pgeneral corpuil—Pgerneral corpu)/ Nword_specific)
The x2 measure faces the same problem of
overgenerating errors. Due to the large sample
sizes, extreme values can be obtained even
though effect size may be minuscule. To reduce
false positives, ALEK requires that effect sizes
be at least in the moderate-to-small range
(Cohen and Cohen, 1983).
142
Direct evidence from the word specific corpus
can also be used to control the overgeneration of
errors. For each candidate error, ALEK
compares the larger context in which the bigram
appears to the contexts that have been analyzed
in the word-specific corpus. From the wordspecific corpus, ALEK forms templates,
sequences of words and tags that represent the
local context of the target. If a test sentence
contains a low probability bigram (as measured
by the x2 test), the local context of the target is
compared to all the templates of which it is a
part. Exceptions to the error, that is longer
grammatical sequences that contain rare subsequences, are found by examining conditional
probabilities. To illustrate this, consider the
example of a knowledge and a knowledge of
The conditional probability of of given a
knowledge is high, as it accounts for almost all
of the occurrences of a knowledge in the wordspecific corpus. Based on this high conditional
probability, the system will use the template for
a knowledge of to keep it from being marked as
an error. Other function words and tags in the +1
position have much lower conditional
probability, so for example, a knowledge is will
not be treated as an exception to the error.
2.3 Validity of the n-gram measures
TOEFL essays are graded on a 6 point scale,
where 6 demonstrates &quot;clear competence&quot; in
writing on rhetorical and syntactic levels and 1
demonstrates &quot;incompetence in writing&quot;. If low
probability n-grams signal grammatical errors,
then we would expect TOEFL essays that
received lower scores to have more of these ngrams. To test this prediction, we randomly
selected from the TOEFL pool 50 essays for
each of the 6 score values from 1.0 to 6.0. For
Score % of bigrams % of trigrams
1.0 3.6 1.4
2.0 3.4 0.8
3.0 2.6 0.6
4.0 1.9 0.3
5.0 1.3 0.4
6.0 1.5 0.3
Table 1: Percent of n-grams with mutual
information <-3.60, by score point
each score value, all 50 essays were
concatenated to form a super-essay. In every
super-essay, for each adjacent pair and triple of
tags containing a noun, verb, or adjective, the
bigram and trigram mutual information values
were computed based on the general corpus.
Table 1 shows the proportions of bigrams and
trigrams with mutual information less than
—3.60. As predicted, there is a significant
negative correlation between the score and the
proportion of low probability bigrams (r,= -.94,
n=6, p<.01, two-tailed) and trigrams (r,= -.84,
n=6, p<.05, two-tailed).
2.4 System development
ALEK was developed using three target words
that were extracted from TOEFL essays:
concentrate, interest, and knowledge. These
words were chosen because they represent
different parts of speech and varying degrees of
polysemy. Each also occurred in at least 150
sentences in what was then a small pool of
TOEFL essays. Before development began, each
occurrence of these words was manually labeled
as an appropriate or inappropriate usage —
without taking into account grammatical errors
that might have been present elsewhere in the
sentence but which were not within the target
word's scope.
Critical values for the statistical measures were
set during this development phase. The settings
were based empirically on ALEK's performance
so as to optimize precision and recall on the
three development words. Candidate errors were
those local context sequences that produced a
mutual information value of less than —3.60
based on the general corpus; mutual information
of less than —5.00 for the specific/general
comparisons; or a x2 value greater than 12.82
with an effect size greater than 0.30. Precision
and recall for the three words are shown below.

3 Experimental Design and Results
ALEK was tested on 20 words. These words
were randomly selected from those which met
two criteria: (1) They appear in a university
word list (Nation, 1990) as words that a student
in a US university will be expected to encounter
and (2) there were at least 1,000 sentences
containing the word in the TOEFL essay pool.
To build the usage model for each target word,
10,000 sentences containing it were extracted
from the North American News Corpus.
Preprocessing included detecting sentence
boundaries and part-of-speech tagging. As in the
development system, the model of general
English was based on bigram and trigram
frequencies of function words and part-ofspeech tags from 30-million words of the San
Jose Mercury News.
For each test word, all of the test sentences were
marked by ALEK as either containing an error
or not containing an error. The size of the test set
for each word ranged from 1,400 to 20,000 with
a mean of 8,000 sentences.
3.1 Results
To evaluate the system, for each test word we
randomly extracted 125 sentences that ALEK
classified as containing no error (C-set) and 125
sentences which it labeled as containing an error
(E-set). These 250 sentences were presented to
a linguist in a random order for blind evaluation.
The linguist, who had no part in ALEK's
development, marked each usage of the target
word as incorrect or correct and in the case of
incorrect usage indicated how far from the target
one would have to look in order to recognise that
there was an error. For example, in the case of
&quot;an period&quot; the error occurs at a distance of one
word from period. When the error is an
omission, as in &quot;lived in Victorian period&quot;, the
distance is where the missing word should have
appeared. In this case, the missing determiner is
2 positions away from the target. When more
than one error occurred, the distance of the one
closest to the target was marked.
Table 3 lists the precision and recall for the 20
test words. The column labelled &quot;Recall&quot; is the
proportion of human-judged errors in the 250sentence sample that were detected by ALEK.
&quot;Total Recall&quot; is an estimate that extrapolates
from the human judgements of the sample to the
entire test set. We illustrate this with the results
for pollution. The human judge marked as
incorrect usage 91.2% of the sample from
ALEK's E-set and 18.4% of the sample from its
C-set. To estimate overall incorrect usage, we
computed a weighted mean of these two rates,
where the weights reflected the proportion of
sentences that were in the E-set and C-set. The
E-set contained 8.3% of the pollution sentences
and the C-set had the remaining 91.7%. With the
human judgements as the gold standard, the
estimated overall rate of incorrect usage is (.083
x .912 + .917 x .184) = .245. ALEK's estimated
recall is the proportion of sentences in the E-set
times its precision, divided by the overall
estimated error rate (.083 x .912) / .245 = .310.
144
The precision results vary from word to word.
Conclusion and pollution have precision in the
low to middle 90's while individual's precision
is 57%. Overall, ALEK's predictions are about
78% accurate. The recall is limited in part by the
fact that the system only looks at syntactic
information, while many of the errors are
semantic.
3.2 Analysis of Hits and Misses
Nicholls (1999) identifies four error types: an
unnecessary word (*affect to their emotions), a
missing word (*opportunity of job.), a word or
phrase that needs replacing (*every jobs), a word
used in the wrong form (*pollutions). ALEK
recognizes all of these types of errors. For closed
class words, ALEK identified whether a word
was missing, the wrong word was used (choice),
and when an extra word was used. Open class
words have a fourth error category, form,
including inappropriate compounding and verb
agreement. During the development stage, we
found it useful to add additional error categories.
Since TEOFL graders are not supposed to take
punctuation into account, punctuation errors
were only marked when they caused the judge to
&quot;garden path&quot; or initially misinterpret the
sentence. Spelling was marked either when a
function word was misspelled, causing part-ofspeech tagging errors, or when the writer's
intent was unclear.
The distributions of categories for hits and
misses, shown in Table 4, are not strikingly
different. However, the hits are primarily
syntactic in nature while the misses are both
semantic (as in open-class:choice) and syntactic
(as in closed-class:missing).
ALEK is sensitive to open-class word
confusions (affect vs effect) where the part of
speech differs or where the target word is
confused with another word (*In this aspect, ...
instead of In this respect,...). In both cases, the
system recognizes that the target is in the wrong
syntactic environment. Misses can also be
syntactic — when the target word is confused
with another word but the syntactic environment
fails to trigger an error. In addition, ALEK does
not recognize semantic errors when the error
involves the misuse of an open-class word in
Category % Hits % Misses

—extra 15.5 13.0

Word order .5 1.0
Table 4: Hits and misses based on a random sample
of 200 hits and 200 misses
combination with the target (for example, make
in &quot;they make benefits&quot;).
Closed class words typically are either selected
by or agree with a head word. So why are there
so many misses, especially with prepositions?
The problem is caused in part by polysemy —
when one sense of the word selects a preposition
that another sense does not. When concentrate is
used spatially, it selects the preposition in, as
&quot;the stores were concentrated in the downtown
area&quot;. When it denotes mental activity, it selects
the preposition on, as in &quot;Susan concentrated on
her studies&quot;. Since ALEK trains on all senses of
concentrate, it does not detect the error in
&quot;Susan concentrated in her studies&quot;. Another
cause is that adjuncts, especially temporal and
locative adverbials, distribute freely in the wordspecific corpora, as in &quot;Susan concentrated in
her room.&quot; This second problem is more
tractable than the polysemy problem — and
would involve training the system to recognize
certain types of adjuncts.
3.3 Analysis of False Positives
False positives, when ALEK &quot;identifies&quot; an
error where none exists, fall into six major
categories. The percentage of each false positive
type in a random sample of 200 false positives is
shown in Table 5.
Domain mismatch: Mismatch of the
newspaper-domain word-specific corpora and
essay-domain test corpus. One notable
difference is that some TOEFL essay prompts
call for the writer's opinion. Consequently,
145
Error Type % Occurrence
Domain mismatch 12.5
Tagger 17.0
Syntactic 14.5
Free distribution 16.5
Punctuation 12.0
Infrequent tags 9.0
Other 18.5
Table 5. Distribution of false positive types
TOEFL essays often contain first person
references, whereas newspaper articles are
written in the third person. We need to
supplement the word-specific corpora with
material that more closely resembles the test
corpus.
Tagger: Incorrect analysis by the part-of-speech
tagger. When the part-of-speech tag is wrong,
ALEK often recognizes the resulting n-gram as
anomalous. Many of these errors are caused by
training on the Brown corpus instead of a corpus
of essays.
Syntactic analysis: Errors resulting from using
part-of-speech tags instead of supertags or a full
parse, which would give syntactic relations
between constituents. For example, ALEK false
alarms on arguments of ditransitive verbs such
as offer and flags as an error &quot;you benefits&quot; in
&quot;offers you benefits&quot;.
Free distribution: Elements that distribute
freely, such as adverbs and conjunctions, as well
as temporal and locative adverbial phrases, tend
to be identified as errors when they occur in
some positions.
Punctuation: Most notably omission of periods
and commas. Since these errors are not
indicative of one's ability to use the target word,
they were not considered as errors unless they
caused the judge to misanalyze the sentence.
Infrequent tags. An undesirable result of our
&quot;enriched&quot; tag set is that some tags, e.g., the
post-determiner last, occur too infrequently in
the corpora to provide reliable statistics.
Solutions to some of these problems will clearly
be more tractable than to others.
4 Comparison of Results
Comparison of these results to those of other
systems is difficult because there is no generally
accepted test set or performance baseline. Given
this limitation, we compared ALEK's
performance to a widely used grammar checker,
the one incorporated in Microsoft's Word97. We
created files of sentences used for the three
development words concentrate, interest, and
knowledge, and manually corrected any errors
outside the local context around the target before
checking them with Word97. The performance
for concentrate showed overall precision of 0.89
and recall of 0.07. For interest, precision was
0.85 with recall of 0.11. In sentences containing
knowledge, precision was 0.99 and recall was
0.30. Word97 correctly detected the
ungrammaticality of knowledges as well as a
knowledge, while it avoided flagging a
knowledge of.
In summary, Word97's precision in error
detection is impressive, but the lower recall
values indicate that it is responding to fewer
error types than does ALEK. In particular,
Word97 is not sensitive to inappropriate
selection of prepositions for these three words
(e.g., *have knowledge on history, *to
concentrate at science). Of course, Word97
detects many kinds of errors that ALEK does
not.
Research has been reported on grammar
checkers specifically designed for an ESL
population. These have been developed by hand,
based on small training and test sets. Schneider
and McCoy (1998) developed a system tailored
to the error productions of American Sign
Language signers. This system was tested on 79
sentences containing determiner and agreement
errors, and 101 grammatical sentences. We
calculate that their precision was 78% with 54%
recall. Park, Palmer and Washburn (1997)
adapted a categorial grammar to recognize
&quot;classes of errors [that] dominate&quot; in the nine
essays they inspected. This system was tested on
eight essays, but precision and recall figures are
not reported.
5 Conclusion
The unsupervised techniques that we have
presented for inferring negative evidence are
effective in recognizing grammatical errors in
written text.
146
Preliminary results indicate that ALEK's error
detection is predictive of TOEFL scores. If
ALEK accurately detects usage errors, then it
should report more errors in essays with lower
scores than in those with higher scores. We have
already seen in Table 1 that there is a negative
correlation between essay score and two of
ALEK's component measures, the general
corpus n-grams. However, the data in Table 1
were not based on specific vocabulary items and
do not reflect overall system performance, which
includes the other measures as well.
Table 6 shows the proportion of test word
occurrences that were classified by ALEK as
containing errors within two positions of the
target at each of 6 TOEFL score points. As
predicted, the correlation is negative (F., = -1.00,
n = 6,p <.001, two-tailed). These data support
the validity of the system as a detector of
inappropriate usage, even when only a limited
number of words are targeted and only the
immediate context of each target is examined.

Table 6: Proportion of test word occurrences, by

For comparison, Table 6 also gives the estimated
proportions of inappropriate usage by score
point based on the human judge's classification.
Here, too, there is a negative correlation: rs =
–.90, n = 5, p < .05, two-tailed.
Although the system recognizes a wide range of
error types, as Table 6 shows, it detects only
about one-fifth as many errors as a human judge
does. To improve recall, research needs to focus
on the areas identified in section 3.2 and, to
improve precision, efforts should be directed at
reducing the false positives described in 3.3.
ALEK is being developed as a diagnostic tool
for students who are learning English as a
foreign language. However, its techniques could
be incorporated into a grammar checker for
native speakers.

We present an unsupervised method for detecting grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from edited textual corpora. The system was developed and tested using essay-length responses to prompts on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The errorrecognition system, ALEK, performs with about 80% precision and 20% recall.

News (hereafter referred to as the general corpus) and, for each target word, a set of 10,000 example sentences from North American newspaper text' (hereafter referred to as the word-specific corpus). The corpora are extracted from the ACL-DCI corpora. In selecting the sentences for the word ALEK infers negative evidence from the contextual cues that do not co-occur with the target word — either in the word specific corpus or in the general English one. It uses two kinds of contextual cues in a ±2 word window around the target word: function words (closed-class items) and part-of-speech tags (Brill, 1994). The Brill tagger output is post-processed to &quot;enrich&quot; some closed class categories of its tag set, such as subject versus object pronoun and definite versus indefinite determiner. The enriched tags were adapted from Francis and Kaera (1982). After the sentences have been preprocessed, ALEK counts sequences of adjacent part-ofspeech tags and function words (such as determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions). For example, the sequence a/AT full-time/I. 1 jobINN contributes one occurrence each to the bigrams AT+JJ, JJ+NN, a+JJ, and to the part-of-speech tag trigram AT+JJ+NN. Each individual t

The system was developed and tested using essay-length responses to prompts on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The errorrecognition system, ALEK, performs with about 80% precision and 20% recall. Introduction A good indicator of whether a person knows the meaning of a word is the ability to use it appropriately in a sentence (Miller and Gildea, 1987). Much information about usage can be obtained from quite a limited context: Choueka and Lusignan (1985) found that people can typically recognize the intended sense of a polysemous word by looking at a narrow window of one or two words around it. Statistically-based computer programs have been able to do the same with a high level of accuracy (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000). The goal of our work is to automatically identify inappropriate usage of specific vocabulary words in essays by looking at the local contextual cues around a target word. We have developed a statistical system, ALEK (Assessing Lexical Knowledge), that uses statistical analysis for this purpose. A major objective of this resea

Due to the large sample sizes, extreme values can be obtained even though effect size may be minuscule. To reduce false positives, ALEK requires that effect sizes be at least in the moderate-to-small range (Cohen and Cohen, 1983). 142 Direct evidence from the word specific corpus can also be used to control the overgeneration of errors. For each candidate error, ALEK compares the larger context in which the bigram appears to the contexts that have been analyzed in the word-specific corpus. From the wordspecific corpus, ALEK forms templates, sequences of words and tags that represent the local context of the target. If a test sentence contains a low probability bigram (as measured by the x2 test), the local context of the target is compared to all the templates of which it is a part. Exceptions to the error, that is lo

ction. We take a different approach, initially viewing error detection as an extension of the word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem. Corpus-based WSD systems identify the intended sense of a polysemous word by (1) collecting a set of example sentences for each of its various senses and (2) extracting salient contextual cues from these sets to (3) build a statistical model for each sense. They identify the intended sense of a word in a novel sentence by extracting its contextual cues and selecting the most similar word sense model (e.g., Leacock, Chodorow and Miller (1998), Yarowsky (1993)). Golding (1995) showed how methods used for WSD (decision lists and Bayesian classifiers) could be adapted to detect errors resulting from 140 common spelling confusions among sets such as there, their, and they're. He extracted contexts from correct usage of each confusable word in a training corpus and then identified a new occurrence as an error when it matched the wrong context. However, most grammatical errors are not the result of simple word confusions. This complicates the task of building a model of incorrect usage. One approach we considered was to proceed without such a model: represent appropriat

the probability of the occurrence of the AB bigram, estimated from its frequency in the general corpus, and P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of the first and second elements of the bigram, also estimated from the general corpus. Ungrammatical sequences should produce bigram probabilities that are much smaller than the product of the unigram probabilities (the value of MI will be negative). Trigram sequences are also used, but in this case the mutual information computation compares the co-occurrence of ABC to a model in which A and C are assumed to be conditionally independent given B (see Lin, 1998). Ml= log2( P (ABC) P(B) x P (AI B) x P(C I B)) Once again, a negative value is often indicative of a sequence that violates a rule of English. 2.2 Comparing the word-specific corpus to the general corpus: ALEK also uses mutual information to compare the distributions of tags and function words in the word-specific corpus to the distributions that are expected based on the general corpus. The measures for bigrams and trigrams are similar to those given above except that the probability in the numerator is estimated from the wordspecific corpus and the probabilities in the denominator come from

These words were randomly selected from those which met two criteria: (1) They appear in a university word list (Nation, 1990) as words that a student in a US university will be expected to encounter and (2) there were at least 1,000 sentences containing the word in the TOEFL essay pool. To build the usage model for each target word, 10,000 sentences containing it were extracted from the North American News Corpus. Preprocessing included detecting sentence boundaries and part-of-speech tagging. As in the development system, the model of general English was based on bigram and trigram frequencies of function words and part-ofspeech tags from 30-million words of the San Jose Mercury News.

all rate of incorrect usage is (.083 x .912 + .917 x .184) = .245. ALEK's estimated recall is the proportion of sentences in the E-set times its precision, divided by the overall estimated error rate (.083 x .912) / .245 = .310. 144 The precision results vary from word to word. Conclusion and pollution have precision in the low to middle 90's while individual's precision is 57%. Overall, ALEK's predictions are about 78% accurate. The recall is limited in part by the fact that the system only looks at syntactic information, while many of the errors are semantic. 3.2 Analysis of Hits and Misses Nicholls (1999) identifies four error types: an unnecessary word (*affect to their emotions), a missing word (*opportunity of job.), a word or phrase that needs replacing (*every jobs), a word used in the wrong form (*pollutions). ALEK recognizes all of these types of errors. For closed class words, ALEK identified whether a word was missing, the wrong word was used (choice), and when an extra word was used. Open class words have a fourth error category, form, including inappropriate compounding and verb agreement. During the development stage, we found it useful to add additional error categories.

osing the words to be tested and assessing the results. Once a target word is chosen, preprocessing, building a model of the word's appropriate usage, and identifying usage errors in essays is performed without manual intervention. ALEK has been developed using the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) administered by the Educational Testing Service. TOEFL is taken by foreign students who are applying to US undergraduate and graduate-level programs. 1 Background Approaches to detecting errors by non-native writers typically produce grammars that look for specific expected error types (Schneider and McCoy, 1998; Park, Palmer and Washburn, 1997). Under this approach, essays written by ESL students are collected and examined for errors. Parsers are then adapted to identify those error types that were found in the essay collection. We take a different approach, initially viewing error detection as an extension of the word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem. Corpus-based WSD systems identify the intended sense of a polysemous word by (1) collecting a set of example sentences for each of its various senses and (2) extracting salient contextual cues from these sets to (3) build a statistical model for eac
e it avoided flagging a knowledge of. In summary, Word97's precision in error detection is impressive, but the lower recall values indicate that it is responding to fewer error types than does ALEK. In particular, Word97 is not sensitive to inappropriate selection of prepositions for these three words (e.g., *have knowledge on history, *to concentrate at science). Of course, Word97 detects many kinds of errors that ALEK does not. Research has been reported on grammar checkers specifically designed for an ESL population. These have been developed by hand, based on small training and test sets. Schneider and McCoy (1998) developed a system tailored to the error productions of American Sign Language signers. This system was tested on 79 sentences containing determiner and agreement errors, and 101 grammatical sentences. We calculate that their precision was 78% with 54% recall. Park, Palmer and Washburn (1997) adapted a categorial grammar to recognize &quot;classes of errors [that] dominate&quot; in the nine essays they inspected. This system was tested on eight essays, but precision and recall figures are not reported. 5 Conclusion The unsupervised techniques that we have presented for inferring negative evidence are e
