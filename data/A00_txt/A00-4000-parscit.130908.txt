Preface
The year 2000 marks the launch of the North American
chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics
(NAACL). The ACL Executive committee under the
leadership of Phil Cohen used this as an opportunity to bring
industry and researchers together to explore the full spectrum
of computational linguistics and natural language processing
by planning a joint conference, combining the 6th Applied
Natural Language Processing Conference (ANLP) and the
1st Conference of NAACL. ANLP-NAACL2000 marks not
only the first major ACL sponsored conference of the new
millennium, but reflects a significant change in the field, as
we see speech and language applications leave the laboratory
and enter every day use.
The technical program covers all facets of the field, from
theory and methodology to its application in commercial
software. We chose to have two independent program chairs
so that papers from each of these two perspectives could be
evaluated independently and they appear in separate sections
of the proceedings. Janyce Wiebe, New Mexico State
University, was the NAACL Program Chair and Sergei
Nirenburg, also from New Mexico State University, was the
ANLP Program Chair. I would like to thank them and their
program committees and teams of reviewers, whose hard
work produced an exciting program with three parallel
sessions, reflecting the breadth of quality research and
application development being done throughout the world.
We were honored to have as invited speakers two industry
leaders: Dave Nagel, President, AT&T Laboratories and
AT&T Chief Technical Officer, speaking on &quot;Voice access
to information&quot;, and Rick Rashid, Vice President, Microsoft
Research, speaking on &quot;The Future - It isn't what it used to
be&quot;. From the academic community, Leonard Talmy, State
University of New York at Buffalo, an internationally
recognized researcher in cognitive science, speaking on
&quot;How Language Structures Concepts&quot;. These plenary
sessions have shown us how far the community has come in
bringing speech and language to the marketplace and to
remind us of the complexity of language and its relationship
to human cognition.
As is traditional at ACL conferences, the program goes
beyond the presentation of technical papers and plenary
sessions. There are also tutorials aimed at helping
participants broaden their knowledge, workshops for
exploring an area in depth, demonstrations to show the
software implementations behind the theories, and exhibits to
display the commercial products that have come out of the
research, much of which was presented at past ACLs. I
would like to thank the Tutorial Chair: Jennifer Chu Carroll
(Lucent Technologies), Workshop Chair: Scott Miller
(BBN), Demonstrations Chair: Jeff Reynar (Microsoft) and
Exhibits Chair: Deborah Dahl (Unisys), all of whom
composed quality programs.
One of the most valuable aspects of ACL conferences is the
opportunity it offers to students, who can get a broad
perspective on the field and meet the people whose papers
they read in their courses. They also have the opportunity
to present their own research, both in the main sessions
and in special student sessions designed to help those in
the early stages of their research. This year, we tried a
new approach with a Student Research Workshop held
before the conference with panelists to provide feedback
to students, for which we received NSF funding from the
Knowledge and Cognitive Systems Program under
Ephraim Glinert. I would like to thank Committee
members Donna Byron (University of Rochester) and
Peter Vanderheyden (University of Waterloo), Co-Chairs,
and Mary Harper (Purdue University), Faculty Advisor
and NSF Principal Investigator and all of the reviewers
who contributed to an excellent program and provided
feedback to the students on their research. I would also
like to thank the students who submitted papers and
attended the workshop. They are the future of our
organization.
Rick Wojcik (Boeing) as Local Arrangements Chair took
care of the myriad of arrangements that go into an event
of this size. Kathy McCoy, Secretary-Treasurer of the
ACL, and Priscilla Rasmussen, ACL Business Manager,
provided unending support in the planning, decision
making, and execution of all of the arrangements. Mark
Maybury (Mitre), Publicity Chair, expanded the number
of places we advertise the conference to help widen our
audience. June Santeusanio and Russell Kenyon from
GTE created and updated a terrific web site, bringing the
information about the conference to a central place.
Russell developed the on-line registration form and
provided support throughout the registration process.
I would especially like to thank Gary Coen (Boeing), who
was the Sponsorship Chair, and all of the commercial
companies who contributed to the conference. We had the
largest level of industry support of any ACL conference
in the past. Microsoft, Boeing, Sun, Intel (China), Xerox
PARC, Logos, Conversa, and General Electric all
contributed funds to support various events, allowing us
to have a commercial grade conference at a hotel facility
while keeping the conference fees at their usual level to
accommodate academic budgets. GTE (BBN),
Answerlogic, IBM, and Inxight provided scholarships to
allow more students to attend the conference.
There are many more people who deserve thanks for
contributing in one way or another. ACL is an all
volunteer organization and it is a credit to everyone who
participates that we can put on an event of this size and
scope, benefiting everyone who attends through the
exchange of ideas and inspiration we get from seeing the
leading edge of the field.

TUTORIALS
Saturday 29 April 2000, 8:30AM-5:00PM
Information Retrieval, 8:30AM-12:00PM
James Allan, University of Massachusetts, Amherst
This tutorial will examine the role of Natural Language Processing in Information Retrieval (IR). It will start with a
historical overview of how NLP has been used and abused over the 40 years of IR research, attempting to illustrate
why distrust of NLP was rampant in the IR community. We will next explore reasons that NLP might have been
doomed to failure in early IR contexts--where basic IR techniques already captured some of what NLP might have
offered, and NLP techniques with even small error rates were therefore unable to offer more. We will then focus on
NLP/IR success stories--both past and present--that show how NLP can be (and has been) successfully used in some
applications. The last portion of the tutorial will focus on very recent applications of NLP for retrieval and
organization purposes. We will discuss the use of NLP and IR as part of Web applications, and as applied to Web
pages. The tutorial will also include a discussion of the exciting Question and Answer track from TREC-8 (1999).
That task results showed that a combination of IR and NLP was highly effective, creating a great opportunity for
future collaboration between the two fields.
The State of the Art in Language Modeling, 8:30AM-12:00PM
Joshua Goodman, Microsoft Research
This tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art in language modeling. The goal of language models is to predict the
probability of words; this is directly useful for speech recognition, handwriting recognition, spelling correction, and
other areas. Because language modeling is one of the most explored areas of statistical modeling, the state of the art
is relatively advanced. Techniques from language modeling may be of interest to anyone pursuing probabilistic
modeling, including those interested in statistical parsing, information retrieval, machine translation, and
compression. The tutorial should be accessible to anyone with an elementary knowledge of probability.
The most basic language models -- n-gram models -- essentially just count occurrences of words in training data. I
will describe six improvements over this simple baseline: smoothing, caching, skipping, sentence-mixture models,
clustering, and parsing-based models.
1) Smoothing addresses the problem of data sparsity: there is rarely enough data to accurately estimate the
parameters of a language model. Smoothing gives a way to combine less specific, more accurate information with
more specific, but noisier data. I will describe two classic techniques: deleted interpolation and Katz (or GoodTuring) smoothing, and one recent technique, Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, which is the best available.
2) Caching is a widely used technique that uses the observation that recently observed words are likely to occur
again. Models from recently observed data can be combined with more general models to improve performance.
3) Skipping models use the observation that even words that are not directly adjacent to the target word contain
useful
information.
4) Sentence-mixture models use the observation that there are many different kinds of sentences. By modeling each
sentence type separately, performance is improved.
5) Clustering is one of the most useful language modeling techniques. Words can be grouped together into clusters
through various automatic techniques; then the probability of a cluster can be predicted instead of the probability of
the word. Clustering can be used to make smaller models or better performing ones.
6) All of the previous techniques ignore the structure of language. Recently, Ciprian Chelba has shown that
techniques from statistical parsing can be used for improved models.
Finally, I will also talk about some practical aspects of language modeling. I will describe how freely available, offthe-shelf tools can be used to easily build language models, and how to use methods such as count cutoffs to
compress language models.
xi
Those who attend the tutorial should walk away with a broad understanding of the current techniques, and the
background needed to either build their own language models, or to apply some of these techniques to other fields.
Finite-State Morphology/Phonology:Theory,Applications,and Recent Developments,
1:30PM-5:00PM
George Kiraz, Lucent Technologies Bell Labs
Morphology and phonology are crucial components in any large scale NLP and/or speech system. Finite-state (FS)
approaches to morphology/phonology are the state-of-the-art in the field; they aim at modeling the
morphology/phonology of language with computational devices whose computational power does not exceed that
of FS machines. Such machines are of interest because they are easy to implement, fast to run and mathematically
elegant. The purpose of this tutorial is to give a comprehensive introduction to the field of computational
morphology, with emphasis on recent developments and practical techniques to build real systems.
The first hour of the tutorial will be introductory, bringing all the participants to a common understanding of the
prerequisites involved: (1) morphology from a linguistics perspective, (2) automata theory from a computer-science
perspective, and (3) how the two fields make up 'FS computational morphology'.
The second hour will concentrate on the theory of FS morphology. The various popular formalisms and notations
will be explained. Algorithms for compiling formalisms into FS machines (i.e., rule compilers) will be detailed with
comprehensive step-by-step examples. Algorithms for interpreting the formalisms directly will be outlined. Recent
developments in the field will be emphasized.
The third hour will concentrate on building practical applications. An introduction to the available tools (and how to
build such tools) will be given. This will be followed by building simple grammars, moving to more complex
grammars, including challenging morphological and morphotactic phenomena (e.g., long-distance dependencies,
heavy agglutinative morphology, reduplications, Semitic root-and-pattern, etc.). The tutorial will demonstrate how
various linguistic descriptions of morphology and phonology (segmental, Autosegmental, prosodic, templatic,
optimality theory, etc.) can be modeled with FS approaches.
The tutorial will end with 'Open Questions' detailing some of the issues that await research.
Machine Translation, 1:30PM-5:00PM
Kevin Knight, USCASI
Mechanical translation of one human language into another is one of the oldest applications of computer science,
with roots going back to the 1940s and 1950s. It did not work very well then, and it does not work very well now.
But, people use it all the time! MT programs can translate email, web pages, and online chat; with human post
editing, they can translate corporate and government documents. There has also been an explosion in the number of
language pairs available. The major force that continues to drive machine translation research is the idea that if it
did work, people would use it a lot more. MT also provides a gauge of the breadth and depth of our scientific
understanding of human language, including both interpretation and generation aspects.
This tutorial will cover a number of practical and theoretical topics. Most of the tutorial will consist of an in-depth
look at several radically different types of MT systems. This will include both special-purpose and general-purpose
MT. We will discuss how various MT systems are constructed, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. We
will describe the workings of an interlingua-based system, and we will give a gentle yet rigorous description of a
corpus-based statistical MT system. We will go through examples during the tutorial and also distribute small-scale
(one-hour to eight-hour) assignments that can be done after the tutorial. These assignments demonstrate basic
principles without requiring extensive programming.
We will also discuss the evaluation of MT systems, the economics of machine translation (including existing
products and services), and the management of both source-language and target-language texts. This last topic
includes ways of authoring documents to reduce ambiguity (&quot;controlled language&quot;), ways of preserving unresolved
ambiguities in output text, and issues concerning pre-editing and post-editing of documents.
xii
Finally, we will briefly discuss the future of MT, taking special account of current research in integrating MT with
other natural language technologies (cross-language information retrieval, speech-to-speech translation,
multilingual summarization, etc). We will also look at how current research in NLP is likely to affect MT in the
future.
Syllabus:
1. Introduction to MT. Why is MT important? History of MT research and commercial development. Generalpurpose vs. special-purpose MT. Architectures that have been used for MT.
2. Building MT Systems. Syntactic transfer: building a lexicon, transfer rules. Interlingua-based MT: domainspecific interlingua design, parsing, semantic interpretation, generation. Direct transfer: statistical algorithms trained
on bilingual corpora, text alignment, transliteration, example-based MT.
3. Managing the Input, Managing the Output. Pre-editing. Reducing ambiguity through controlled-language source
text. Post-editing. Ambiguity preservation.
4. Evaluation of MT Systems. Why it's hard. Metrics that have been proposed and used. Strengths and weaknesses.
5. The Economics of MT. Products and services available.
6. The Future of MT. Integrating MT with other natural language technologies: cross-language information
retrieval, speech-to-speech MT, summarizing foreign-language documents. How current NLP research bears on
MT.

(NAACL). The ACL Executive committee under the leadership of Phil Cohen used this as an opportunity to bring industry and researchers together to explore the full spectrum of computational linguistics and natural language processing by planning a joint conference, combining the 6th Applied Natural Language Processing Conference (ANLP) and the 1st Conference of NAACL. ANLP-NAACL2000 marks not only the first major ACL sponsored conference of the new millennium, but reflects a significant change in the field, as we see speech and language applications leave the laboratory and enter every day use. The technical program covers all facets of the field, from theory and methodology to its application in commercial software. We chose to have two independent program chairs so that papers from each of these two perspectives could be evaluated independently and they appear in separate sections of the proceedings. Janyce Wiebe, New Mexico State University, was the NAACL Program Chair and Sergei Nirenburg, also from New Mexico State University, was the ANLP Program Chair. I would like to thank them and their program committees and teams of reviewers, whose hard work produced an exciting program with three parallel sessions, reflecting the breadth of quality research and application development being done throughout the world. We were honored to have as invited speakers two industry leaders: Dave Nagel, President, AT&T Laboratories and AT&T Chief Technical Officer, speaking on &quot;Voice access to information&quot;, and Rick Rashid, Vice President, Microsoft Research, speaking on &quot;The Future - It isn't what it used to be&quot;. From the academic community, Leonard Talmy, State University of New York at Buffalo, an internationally recognized researcher in cognitive science, speaking on &quot;How Language Structures Concepts&quot;. These plenary sessions have shown us how far the community has come in bringing speech and language to the marketplace and to remind us of the complexity of language and its relationship to human cognition. As is traditional at ACL conferences, the program goes beyond the presentation of technical papers and plenary sessions. There are also tutorials aimed at helping participants broaden their knowledge, workshops for exploring an area in depth, demonstrations to show the software implementations behind the theories, and exhibits to display the commercial products that have come out of the research, much of which was presented at past ACLs. I would like to thank the Tutorial Chair: Jennifer Chu Carroll (Lucent Technologies), Workshop Chair: Scott Miller (BBN), Demonstrations Chair: Jeff Reynar (Microsoft) and Exhibits Chair: Deborah Dahl (Unisys), all of whom composed quality programs. One of the most valuable aspects of ACL conferences is the opportunity it offers to students, who can get a broad perspective on the field and meet the people whose papers they read in their courses. They also have the opportunity to present their own research, both in the main sessions and in special student sessions designed to help those in the early stages of their research. This year, we tried a new approach with a Student Research Workshop held before the conference with panelists to provide feedback to students, for which we received NSF funding from the Knowledge and Cognitive Systems Program under Ephraim Glinert. I would like to thank Committee members Donna Byron (University of Rochester) and Peter Vanderheyden (University of Waterloo), Co-Chairs, and Mary Harper (Purdue University), Faculty Advisor and NSF Principal Investigator and all of the reviewers who contributed to an excellent program and provided feedback to the students on their research. I would also like to thank the students who submitted papers and attended the workshop. They are the future of our organization. Rick Wojcik (Boeing) as Local Arrangements Chair took care of the myriad of arrangements that go into an event of this size. Kathy McCoy, Secretary-Treasurer of the ACL, and Priscilla Rasmussen, ACL Business Manager, provided unending support in the planning, decision making, and execution of all of the arrangements. Mark Maybury (Mitre), Publicity Chair, expanded the number of places we advertise the conference to help widen our audience. June Santeusanio and Russell Kenyon from GTE created and updated a terrific web site, bringing the information about the conference to a central place. Russell developed the on-line registration form and provided support throughout the registration process. I would especially like to thank Gary Coen (Boeing), who was the Sponsorship Chair, and all of the commercial companies who contributed to the conference. We had the largest level of industry support of any ACL conference in the past. Microsoft, Boeing, Sun, Intel (China), Xerox PARC, Logos, Conversa, and General Electric all contributed funds to support various events, allowing us to have a commercial grade conference at a hotel facility while keeping the conference fees at their usual level to accommodate academic budgets. GTE (BBN), Answerlogic, IBM, and Inxight provided scholarships to allow more students to attend the conference. There are many more people who deserve thanks for contributing in one way or another. ACL is an all volunteer organization and it is a credit to everyone who participates that we can put on an event of this size and scope, benefiting everyone who attends through the exchange of ideas and inspiration we get from seeing the leading edge of the field.

It will start with a historical overview of how NLP has been used and abused over the 40 years of IR research, attempting to illustrate why distrust of NLP was rampant in the IR community. We will next explore reasons that NLP might have been doomed to failure in early IR contexts--where basic IR techniques already captured some of what NLP might have offered, and NLP techniques with even small error rates were therefore unable to offer more. We will then focus on NLP/IR success stories--both past and present--that show how NLP can be (and has been) successfully used in some applications. The last portion of the tutorial will focus on very recent applications of NLP for retrieval and organization purposes. We will discuss the use of NLP and IR as part of Web applications, and as applied to Web pages. The tutorial will also include a discussion of the exciting Question and Answer track from TREC-8 (1999). That task results showed that a combination of IR and NLP was highly effective, creating a great opportunity for future collaboration between the two fields. The State of the Art in Language Modeling, 8:30AM-12:00PM Joshua Goodman, Microsoft Research This tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art in language modeling. The goal of language models is to predict the probability of words; this is directly useful for speech recognition, handwriting recognition, spelling correction, and other areas. Because language modeling is one of the most explored areas of statistical modeling, the state of the art is relatively advanced. Techniques from language modeling may be of interest to anyone pursuing probabilistic modeling, including those interested in statistical parsing, information retrieval, machine translation, and compression. The tutorial should be accessible to anyone with an elementary knowledge of probability. The most basic language models -n-gram models -essentially just count occurrences of words in training data. I will describe six improvements over this simple baseline: smoothing, caching, skipping, sentence-mixture models, clustering, and parsing-based models. 1) Smoothing addresses the problem of data sparsity: there is rarely enough data to accurately estimate the parameters of a language model. Smoothing gives a way to combine less specific, more accurate information with more specific, but noisier data. I will describe two classic techniques: deleted interpolation and Katz (or Good- Turing) smoothing, and one recent technique, Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, which is the best available. 2) Caching is a widely used technique that uses the observation that recently observed words are likely to occur again. Models from recently observed data can be combined with more general models to improve performance. 3) Skipping models use the observation that even words that are not directly adjacent to the target word contain useful information. 4) Sentence-mixture models use the observation that there are many different kinds of sentences. By modeling each sentence type separately, performance is improved. 5) Clustering is one of the most useful language modeling techniques. Words can be grouped together into clusters through various automatic techniques; then the probability of a cluster can be predicted instead of the probability of the word. Clustering can be used to make smaller models or better performing ones. 6) All of the previous techniques ignore the structure of language. Recently, Ciprian Chelba has shown that techniques from statistical parsing can be used for improved models. Finally, I will also talk about some practical aspects of language modeling. I will describe how freely available, offthe-shelf tools can be used to easily build language models, and how to use methods such as count cutoffs to compress language models. Those who attend the tutorial should walk away with a broad understanding of the current techniques, and the background needed to either build their own language models, or to apply some of these techniques to other fields. Finite-State Morphology/Phonology:Theory,Applications,and Recent Developments, 1:30PM-5:00PM George Kiraz, Lucent Technologies Bell Labs Morphology and phonology are crucial components in any large scale NLP and/or speech system. Finite-state (FS) approaches to morphology/phonology are the state-of-the-art in the field; they aim at modeling the morphology/phonology of language with computational devices whose computational power does not exceed that
of FS machines. Such machines are of interest because they are easy to implement, fast to run and mathematically
