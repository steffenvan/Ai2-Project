Abstract
We empirically show that there are significant differences between the discourse structure of Japanese
texts and the discourse structure of their corresponding English translations. To improve translation quality, we propose a computational model
for rewriting discourse structures, When we train
our model on a parallel corpus of manually built
Japanese and English discourse structure trees, we
learn to rewrite Japanese trees as trees that are
closer to the natural English rendering than the original ones.
1 Motivation
Almost all current MT systems process text one sentence at a time. Because of this limited focus, MT
systems cannot re-group and re-order the clauses
and sentences of an input text to achieve the most
natural rendering in a target language. Yet, even
between languages as close as English and French,
there is a 10% mismatch in number of sentences
— what is said in two sentences in one language
is said in only one, or in three, in the other (Gale
and Church, 1993). For distant language pairs, such
as Japanese and English, the differences are more
significant.
Consider, for example, Japanese sentence (1), a
word-by-word &quot;gloss&quot; of it (2), and a two-sentence
translation of it that was produced by a professional
translator (3).

will be quickly shattered.6]
The labeled spans of text represent elementary
discourse units (edus), i.e., minimal text spans that
have an unambiguous discourse function (Mann and
Thompson, 1988). If we analyze the text fragments closely, we will notice that in translating sentence (1), a professional translator chose to realize
the information in Japanese unit 2 first (unit 2 in
text (1) corresponds roughly to unit 1 in text (3));
to realize then some of the information in Japanese
unit 1 (part of unit 1 in text (1) corresponds to unit
2 in text (3)); to fuse then information given in units
1, 3, and 5 in text (1) and realize it in English as
unit 3; and so on. Also, the translator chose to repackage the information in the original Japanese sentence into two English sentences.
At the elementary unit level, the correspondence
between Japanese sentence (1) and its English translation (3) can be represented as in (4), where j C e
denotes the fact that the semantic content of unit
j is realized fully in unit e; j j e denotes the fact
that the semantic content of unit e is realized fully
in unit j; j = e denotes the fact that units j and e
are semantically equivalent; and j e denotes the
fact that there is a semantic overlap between units j
and e, but neither proper inclusion nor proper equivalence.

Figure 1: The discourse structures of texts (1) and (3).
Hence, the mappings in (4) provide an explicit
representation of the way information is re-ordered
and re-packaged when translated from Japanese into
English. However, when translating text, it is also
the case that the rhetorical rendering changes. What
is realized in Japanese using an CONTRAST relation
can be realized in English using, for example, a COMPARISON or a CONCESSION relation.
Figure 1 presents in the style of Mann and Thompson (1988) the discourse structures of text fragments (1) and (3). Each discourse structure is a
tree whose leaves correspond to the edus and whose
internal nodes correspond to contiguous text spans.
Each node is characterized by a status (NUCLEUS or
SATELLITE) and a rhetorical relation, which is a relation that holds between two non-overlapping text
spans. The distinction between nuclei and satellites
comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's
intention than the satellite; and that the nucleus of
a rhetorical relation is comprehensible independent
of the satellite, but not vice versa. When spans are
equally important. the relation is multinuclear: for
example. the CONTRAST relation that holds between
unit [3] and span [4.5] in the rhetorical structure of
the English text in figure 1 is multinuclear. Rhetorical relations that end in the suffix --e- denote relations that correspond to embedded syntactic constituents. For example. the ELABORATION-OBJECTATTRIBUTE-E relation that holds between units 2
and 1 in the English discourse structure corresponds
to a restrictive relative.
If one knows the mappings at the edu level,
one can determine the mappings at the span (discourse constituent) level as well. For example, using the elementary mappings in (4), one can determine that Japanese span [1,2] corresponds to English
span [1,2]. Japanese unit [4] to English span [4,5],
Japanese span [6.7] to English unit [6], Japanese
span [1.5] to English span [1,5]. and so on. As Figure 1 shows, the CONCESSION relation that. holds between spans [1,5] and [6,7] in the Japanese tree corresponds to a similar relation that holds between span
[1.5] and unit [6] in the English tree (modulo the fact
that, in Japanese, the relation holds between sentence fragments, while in English it. holds between
full sentences). However, the TEMPORAL-AFTER relation that holds between units [3] and [4] in the
Japanese tree is realized as a CONTRAST relation
between unit [3] and span [4.5] in the English tree.
And because Japanese units [6] and [7] are fused
into unit [6] in English, the relation ELABORATIONOBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E is no longer made explicit in
the English text.
Some of the differences between the two discourse
trees in Figure 1 have been traditionally addressed

Table 1: Tagging reliability
in MT systems at the syntactic level. For example, the re-ordering of units 1 and 2, can be dealt
with using only syntactic models. However, as we
will see in Section 2, there are significant differences
between Japanese and English with respect to the
way information is packaged and organized rhetorically not only at the sentence level, but also, at the
paragraph and text levels. More specifically, as humans translate Japanese into English, they re-order
the clauses, sentences, and paragraphs of Japanese
texts, they re-package the information into clauses,
sentences, and paragraphs that are not a one-to-one
mapping of the original Japanese units, and they
rhetorically re-organize the structure of the translated text so as to reflect rhetorical constraints specific to English. If a translation system is to produce
text that is not only grammatical but also coherent,
it will have to ensure that the discourse structure of
the target text reflects the natural renderings of the
target language, and not that of the source language.
In Section 2, we empirically show that there are
significant differences between the rhetorical structure of Japanese texts and their corresponding English translations. These differences justify our investigation into developing computational models
for discourse structure rewriting. In Section 3, we
present such a rewriting model, which re-orders the
edus of the original text, determines English-specific
clause, sentence, and paragraph boundaries, and rebuilds the Japanese discourse structure of a text using English-specific rhetorical renderings. In Section 4, we evaluate the performance of an implementation of this model. We end with a discussion.
2 Experiment
In order to assess the role of discourse structure in
MT, we built manually a corpus of discourse trees
for 40 Japanese texts and their corresponding translations. The texts were selected randomly from the
ARPA corpus (White and O'Connell, 1994). On average, each text had about 460 words. The Japanese
texts had a total of 335 paragraphs and 773 sentences. The English texts had a total of 337 paragraphs and 827 sentences.
We developed a discourse annotation protocol for
Japanese and English along the lines followed by
Marcu et al. (1999). We used Marcu's discourse annotation tool (1999) in order to manually construct
the discourse structure of all Japanese and English
texts in the corpus. 10% of the Japanese and English texts were rhetorically labeled by two of us.
The tool and the annotation protocol are available
at http://www.isi.edu/—marcu/software/. The annotation procedure yielded over the entire corpus
2641 Japanese edus and 2363 English edus.
We computed the reliability of the annotation using Marcu et al. (1999)'s method for computing
kappa statistics (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) over hierarchical structures. Table 1 displays average kappa
statistics that reflect the reliability of the annotation of elementary discourse units, k, hierarchical
discourse spans, ks, hierarchical nuclearity assignments, kr„ and hierarchical rhetorical relation assignments, kr. Kappa figures higher than 0.8 correspond to good agreement; kappa figures higher than
0.6 correspond to acceptable agreement. All kappa
statistics were statistically significant at levels higher
than a = 0.01. In addition to the kappa statistics, table 1 also displays in parentheses the average
number of data points per document, over which the
kappa statistics were computed.
For each pair of Japanese-English discourse structures, we also built manually an alignment file,
which specified in the notation discussed on page 1
the correspondence between the edus of the Japanese
text and the edus of its English translation.
We computed the similarity between English and
Japanese discourse trees using labeled recall and precision figures that reflected the resemblance of the
Japanese and English discourse structures with respect to their assignment of edu boundaries, hierarchical spans, nuclearity, and rhetorical relations.
Because the trees we compared differ from one
language to the other in the number of elementary
units, the order of these units, and the way the units
are grouped recursively into discourse spans, we
computed two types of recall and precision figures.
In computing Position-Dependent (P-D) recall and
precision figures, a Japanese span was considered to
match an English span when the Japanese span contained all the Japanese edus that corresponded to the
edus in the English span, and when the Japanese and
English spans appeared in the same position with
respect to the overall structure. For example, the
English tree in figure 1 is characterized by 10 subsentential spans: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [1,2], [4,5],
[3,5], and [1,5]. (Span [1,6] subsumes 2 sentences,
so it is not sub-sentential.) The Japanese discourse
tree has only 4 spans that could be matched in the
same positions with English spans, namely spans
[1,2], [4], [5], and [1,5]. Hence the similarity between
the Japanese tree and the English tree with respect

Table 2: Similarity of the Japanese and English discourse structures
to their discourse structure below the sentence level
has a recall of 4/10 and a precision of 4/11 (in Figure 1, there are 11 sub-sentential Japanese spans).
In computing Position-Independent (P-I) recall
and precision figures, even when a Japanese span
&quot;floated&quot; during the translation to a position in the
English tree that was different from the position in
the initial tree, the P-I recall and precision figures
were not affected. The Position-Independent figures
reflect the intuition that if two trees ti and 19 both
have a subtree t, ti and 19 are more similar than
if they were if they didn't share any tree. At the
sentence level, we hence assume that if, for example, the syntactic structure of a relative clause is
translated appropriately (even though it is not appropriately attached), this is better than translating
wrongly that clause. The Position-Independent figures offer a more optimistic metric for comparing
discourse trees. They span a wider range of values
than the Position-Dependent figures, which enable
a finer grained comparison, which in turn enables
a better characterization of the differences between
Japanese and English discourse structures. When
one takes an optimistic stance, for the spans at the
sub-sentential level in the trees in Table 1 the recall
is 6/10 and the precision is 6/11 because in addition
to spans [1,2], [4], [5], and [1,5], one can also match
Japanese span [1] to English span [2] and Japanese
span [2] to Japanese span [1].
In order to provide a better estimate of how close
two discourse trees were, we computed PositionDependent and -Independent recall and precision figures for the sentential level (where units are given by
edus and spans are given by sets of edus or single sentences); paragraph level (where units are given by
sentences and spans are given by sets of sentences
or single paragraphs); and text level (where units
are given by paragraphs and spans are given by sets
of paragraphs). These figures offer a detailed picture of how discourse structures and relations are
mapped from one language to the other across all
discourse levels, from sentence to text. The differences at the sentence level can be explained by differences between the syntactic structures of Japanese
and English. The differences at the paragraph and
text levels have a purely rhetorical explanation.
As expected, when we computed the recall and
precision figures with respect to the nuclearity and
relation assignments, we also factored in the statuses
and the rhetorical relations that labeled each pair of
spans.
Table 2 summarizes the results (P-D and PI (R)ecall and (P)recision figures) for each level
(Sentence, Paragraph, and Text). The numbers
in the &quot;Weighted Average&quot; line report averages of
the Sentence-, Paragraph-, and Text-specific figures,
weighted according to the number of units at each
level. The numbers in the &quot;All&quot; line reflect recall and
precision figures computed across the entire trees,
with no attention paid to sentence and paragraph
boundaries.
Given the significantly different syntactic structures of Japanese and English, we were not surprised
by the low recall and precision results that reflect
the similarity between discourse trees built below
the sentence level. However, as Table 2 shows, there
are significant differences between discourse trees at
the paragraph and text levels as well. For example, the Position-Independent figures show that only
about 62% of the sentences and only about 53% of
the hierarchical spans built across sentences could
be matched between the two corpora. When one
looks at the status and rhetorical relations associated with the spans built across sentences at the
paragraph level, the P-I recall and precision figures
drop to about 43% and 35% respectively.
The differences in recall and precision are explained both by differences in the way information is
packaged into paragraphs in the two languages and
the way it is structured rhetorically both within and
above the paragraph level.
These results strongly suggest that if one attempts
12
to translate Japanese into English on a sentence-bysentence basis, it is likely that the resulting text will
be unnatural from a discourse perspective. For example, if some information rendered using a CONTRAST relation in Japanese is rendered using an
ELABORATION relation in English, it would be inappropriate to use a discourse marker like &quot;but&quot; in
the English translation, although that would be consistent with the Japanese discourse structure.
An inspection of the rhetorical mappings between
Japanese and English revealed that some Japanese
rhetorical renderings are consistently mapped into
one or a few preferred renderings in English. For example, 34 of 115 CONTRAST relations in the Japanese
texts are mapped into CONTRAST relations in English; 27 become nuclei of relations such as ANTITHESIS and CONCESSION, 14 are translated as COMPARISON relations, 6 as satellites of CONCESSION relations, 5 as LIST relations, etc. Our goal is to learn
these systematic discourse mapping rules and exploit
them in a machine translation context.
3 Towards a discourse-based
machine translation system
3.1 Overall architecture
We are currently working towards building the modules of a Discourse-Based Machine Translation system that works along the following lines.
1. A discourse parser, such as those described by
Sumita et al. (1992), Kurohashi (1994), and
Marcu (1999), initially derives the discourse
structure of the text given as input.
2. A discourse-structure transfer module
rewrites the discourse structure of the input
text so as to reflect a discourse rendering
that is natural to the target language.
3. A statistical module maps the input text
into the target language using translation and
language models that incorporate discoursespecific features, which are extracted from the
outputs of the discourse parser and discourse
transfer modules.
In this paper, we focus only on the discoursestructure transfer module. That is, we investigate
the feasibility of building such a module.
3.2 The discourse-based transfer model
In order to learn to rewrite discourse structure trees,
we first address a related problem, which we define
below:
Definition 3.1 Given two trees T, and T, and a
correspondence Table C defined between T, and T1
at the leaf level in terms of C, D, and relations,
find a sequence of actions that rewrites the tree T.
into I.
If for any tuple (Ts, T, C) such a sequence of actions
can be derived, it is then possible to use a corpus
of (T3, T C) tuples in order to automatically learn
to derive from an unseen tree Ta, which has the
same structural properties as the trees T,, a tree
which has structural properties similar to those
of the trees T.
In order to solve the problem in definition 3.1, we
extend the shift-reduce parsing paradigm applied by
Magerman (1995), Hermjakob and Mooney (1997),
and Marcu (1999). In this extended paradigm, the
transfer process starts with an empty Stack and an
Input List that contains a sequence of elementary
discourse trees edts, one edt for each edu in the tree
T, given as input. The status and rhetorical relation associated with each edt is undefined. At each
step, the transfer module applies an operation that is
aimed at building from the units in T, the discourse
tree T. In the context of our discourse-transfer module, we need 7 types of operations:
• SHIFT operations transfer the first edt from
the input list into the stack;
• REDUCE operations pop the two discourse
trees located at the top of the stack; combine
them into a new tree updating the statuses
and rhetorical relation names of the trees involved in the operation; and push the new
tree on the top of the stack. These operations are used to build the structure of the
discourse tree in the target language.
• BREAK operations are used in order to break
the edt at the beginning of the input list into
a predetermined number of units. These operations are used to ensure that the resulting tree has the same number of edts as Tt.
A BREAK operation is necessary whenever a
Japanese edu is mapped into multiple English
units.
• CREATE-NEXT operations are used in order
to create English discourse constituents that
have no correspondent in the Japanese tree.
• FUSE operations are used in order to fuse the
edt at the top of the stack into the tree that
immediately precedes it. These operations
are used whenever multiple Japanese edus are
mapped into one English edu.
• SWAP operations swap the edt at the beginning of the input list with an edt found one
or more positions to the right. These operations are necessary for re-ordering discourse
constituents.
• ASSIGNTYPE operations assign one or more of
the following types to the tree at the top of
the stack: Unit, MultiUnit, Sentence, Paragraph, MultiParagraph, and Text. These op
13
erations are necessary in order to ensure sentence and paragraph boundaries that are specific to the target language.
For example, the first sentence of the English tree in
Figure 1 can be obtained from the original Japanese
sequence by following the sequence of actions (5),
whose effects are shown in Figure 2. For the purpose
of compactness, the figure does not illustrate the effect of ASSIGNTYPE actions. For the same purpose,
some lines correspond to more than one action.

For our corpus, in order to enable a discoursebased transfer module to derive any English discourse tree starting from any Japanese discourse
tree, it is sufficient to implement:
• one SHIFT operation;
• 3 x 2 x 85 REDUCE operations; (For each
of the three possible pairs of nuclearity assignments NUCLEUS-SATELLITE (NS),
SATELLITE-NUCLEUS (SN), AND NUCLEUSNUCLEUS (NN), there are two possible ways
to reduce two adjacent trees (one results
in a binary tree, the other in a non-binary
tree (Marcu, 1999)), and 85 relation names.)
• three types of BREAK operations; (In our corpus, a Japanese unit is broken into two, three,
or at most four units.)
• one type of CREATE-NEXT operation;
• one type of FUSE operation;
• eleven types of SWAP operations; (In our
corpus, Japanese units are at most 11 positions away from their location in an Englishspecific rendering.)
• seven types of ASSIGNTYPE operations: Unit,
MultiUnit, Sentence, MultiSentence, Paragraph, MultiParagraph, and Text.
These actions are sufficient for rewriting any tree
T, into any tree Tt, where Tt may have a different
number of edus, where the edus of Tt may have a
different ordering than the edus of T,, and where
the hierarchical structures of the two trees may be
different as well.
3.3 Learning the parameters of the
discourse-transfer model
We associate with each configuration of our transfer model a learning case. The cases were generated by a program that automatically derived the
sequence of actions that mapped the Japanese trees
in our corpus into the sibling English trees, using the
correspondences at the elementary unit level that
were constructed manually. Overall, the 40 pairs of
Japanese and English discourse trees yielded 14108
cases.
To each learning example, we associated a set of
features from the following classes:
Operational and discourse features reflect the
number of trees in the stack, the input list,
and the types of the last five operations.
They encode information pertaining to the
types of the partial trees built up to a certain
time and the rhetorical relations that hold between these trees.
Correspondence-based features reflect the nuclearity, rhetorical relations, and types of
the Japanese trees that correspond to the
English-like partial trees derived up to a given
time.
Lexical features specify whether the Japanese
spans that correspond to the structures derived up to a given time use potential discourse markers, such as dakara (because) and
no nz (although).
The discourse transfer module uses the C4.5 program (Quinlan, 1993) in order to learn decision trees
and rules that specify how Japanese discourse trees
should be mapped into English-like trees. A ten-fold
cross-validation evaluation of the classifier yielded an
accuracy of 70.2% (± 0.21).
In order to better understand the strengths and
weaknesses of the classifier, we also attempted to
break the problem into smaller components. Hence,
instead of learning all actions at once, we attempted
to learn first whether the rewriting procedure should
choose a SHIFT, REDUCE, BREAK, FUSE, SWAP, or
ASSIGNTYPE operation (the &quot;Main Action Type&quot;
classifier in table 3), and only then to refine this
decision by determining what type of reduce operation to perform, how many units to break a Japanese
units into, how big the distance to the stvAP-ed unit
should be, and what type of ASSIGNTYPE operation
one should perform. Table 3 shows the sizes of each

data set and the performance of each of these classifiers, as determined using a ten-fold cross-validation
procedure. For the purpose of comparison, each classifier is paired with a majority baseline.
The results in Table 3 show that the most difficult subtasks to learn are that of determining the
number of units a Japanese unit should be broken
into and that of determining the distance to the unit
that is to be swapped. The features we used are
not able to refine the baseline classifiers for these
action types. The confusion matrix for the &quot;Main
Action Type&quot; classifier (see Table 5) shows that the
system has trouble mostly identifying BREAK and
CREATE-NEXT actions. The system has difficulty
learning what type of nuclearity ordering to prefer (the &quot;Nuclearity-Reduce&quot; classifier) and what relation to choose for the English-like structure (the
&quot;Relation-Reduce&quot; classifier).
Figure 3 shows a typical learning curve, the one
that corresponds to the &quot;Reduce Relation&quot; classifier.
Our learning curves suggest that more training data
may improve performance. However, they also suggest that better features may be needed in order to
improve performance significantly.
Table 4 displays some learned rules. The first rule
accounts for rhetorical mappings in which the order of the nucleus and satellite of an ATTRIBUTION
relation is changed when translated from Japanese
into English. The second rule was learned in order
to map EXAMPLE Japanese satellites into EVIDENCE
English satellites.

4 Evaluation of the discourse-based
transfer module
By applying the General classifier or the other six
classifiers successively, one can map any Japanese
discourse tree into a tree whose structure comes
closer to the natural rendering of English. To evaluate the discourse-based transfer module, we carried
out a ten-fold cross-validation experiment. That is,
we trained the classifiers on 36 pairs of manually
built and aligned discourse structures, and we then
used the learned classifiers in order to map 4 unseen Japanese discourse trees into English-like trees.
We measured the similarity of the derived trees with
the English trees built manually, using the metrics
discussed in Section 2. We repeated the procedure
ten times, each time training and testing on different
subsets of tree pairs.
We take the results reported in Table 2 as a baseline for our model. The baseline corresponds to applying no knowledge of discourse. Table 6 displays
the absolute improvement (in percentage points) in
recall and precision figures obtained when the General classifier was used to map Japanese trees into
English-looking trees. The General classifier yielded
the best results. The results in Table 6 are averaged
over a ten-fold cross-validation experiment.
The results in Table 6 show that our model
outperforms the baseline with respect to building
English-like discourse structures for sentences, but
it under-performs the baseline with respect to building English-like structures at the paragraph and text
levels. The main shortcoming of our model seems to
come from its low performance in assigning paragraph boundaries. Because our classifier does not
learn correctly which spans to consider paragraphs
and which spans not, the recall and precision results
at the paragraph and text levels are negatively affected. The poorer results at the paragraph and text
levels can be also explained by errors whose effect cumulates during the step-by-step tree-reconstruction
procedure; and by the fact that, for these levels,
there is less data to learn from.
However, if one ignores the sentence and paragraph boundaries and evaluates the discourse structures overall, one can see that our model outperforms the baseline on all accounts according to
the Position-Dependent evaluation; outperforms the
baseline with respect to the assignment of elementary units, hierarchical spans, and nuclearity statuses according to the Position-Independent evaluation and under-performs the baseline only slightly

More sophisticated discourse features, such as those
discussed by Maynard (1998), for example, and a
tighter integration with the lexicogrammar of the
two languages may yield better cues for learning
discourse-based translation models.
5 Conclusion
We presented a systematic empirical study of the
role of discourse structure in MT. Our study strongly
supports the need for enriching MT systems with
a discourse module, capable of re-ordering and repackaging the information in a source text in a way
that is consistent with the discourse rendering of a
target language. We presented an extended shiftreduce parsing model that can be used to map discourse trees specific to a source language into discourse trees specific to a target language. Our model
outperforms a baseline with respect to its ability to
predict the discourse structure of sentences. Our
model also outperforms the baseline with respect
to its ability to derive discourse structures that are
closer to the natural, rhetorical rendering in a target language than the original discourse structures
in the source language. Our model is still unable to
determine correctly how to re-package sentences into
paragraphs; a better understanding of the notion of
&quot;paragraph&quot; is required in order to improve this.

We empirically show that there are significant differences between the discourse structure of Japanese texts and the discourse structure of their corresponding English translations. To improve translation quality, we propose a computational model for rewriting discourse structures, When we train our model on a parallel corpus of manually built Japanese and English discourse structure trees, we learn to rewrite Japanese trees as trees that are closer to the natural English rendering than the original ones. 1 Motivation Almost all current MT systems process text one sentence at a time. Because of this limited focus, MT systems cannot re-group and re-order the clauses and sentences of an input text to achieve the most natural rendering in a target language. Yet, even between languages as close as English and French, there is a 10% mismatch in number of sentences — what is said in two sentences in one language is said in only one, or in three, in the other (Gale and Church, 1993). For distant language pairs, such as Japanese and English, the differences are more significant. Consider, for example, Japanese sentence (1), a word-by-word &quot;gloss&quot; of it (2), and a two-sentence translation of it that was produced by a professional translator (3).

If we analyze the text fragments closely, we will notice that in translating sentence (1), a professional translator chose to realize the information in Japanese unit 2 first (unit 2 in text (1) corresponds roughly to unit 1 in text (3)); to realize then some of the information in Japanese unit 1 (part of unit 1 in text (1) corresponds to unit 2 in text (3)); to fuse then information given in units 1, 3, and 5 in text (1) and realize it in English as unit 3; and so on. Also, the translator chose to repackage the information in the original Japanese sentence into two English sentences. At the elementary unit level, the correspondence between Japanese sentence (1) and its English trans- (3) can be represented as in (4), where e denotes the fact that the semantic content of unit realized fully in unit j j denotes the fact the semantic content of unit realized fully unit j e denotes the fact that units e semantically equivalent; and the that there is a semantic overlap between units and e, but neither proper inclusion nor proper equivalence.

Figure 1: The discourse structures of texts (1) and (3). Hence, the mappings in (4) provide an explicit representation of the way information is re-ordered and re-packaged when translated from Japanese into English. However, when translating text, it is also the case that the rhetorical rendering changes. What realized in Japanese using CONTRAST can be realized in English using, for example, a COM- PARISON or a CONCESSION relation. Figure 1 presents in the style of Mann and Thompson (1988) the discourse structures of text fragments (1) and (3). Each discourse structure is a whose leaves correspond to the whose internal nodes correspond to contiguous text spans. node is characterized by a a relation, is a relation that holds between two non-overlapping text spans. The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's intention than the satellite; and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is comprehensible independent of the satellite, but not vice versa. When spans are equally important. the relation is multinuclear: for the that holds between unit [3] and span [4.5] in the rhetorical structure of the English text in figure 1 is multinuclear. Rhetorrelations that end in the suffix denote relations that correspond to embedded syntactic con- For example. the ELABORATION-OBJECTthat holds between units 2 and 1 in the English discourse structure corresponds to a restrictive relative. one knows the mappings at the one can determine the mappings at the span (discourse constituent) level as well. For example, using the elementary mappings in (4), one can determine that Japanese span [1,2] corresponds to English span [1,2]. Japanese unit [4] to English span [4,5], Japanese span [6.7] to English unit [6], Japanese span [1.5] to English span [1,5]. and so on. As Fig- 1 shows, the that. holds between spans [1,5] and [6,7] in the Japanese tree corresponds to a similar relation that holds between span [1.5] and unit [6] in the English tree (modulo the fact that, in Japanese, the relation holds between sentence fragments, while in English it. holds between sentences). However, the relation that holds between units [3] and [4] in the tree is realized as a between unit [3] and span [4.5] in the English tree. And because Japanese units [6] and [7] are fused unit [6] in English, the relation ELABORATIONno longer made explicit in the English text.

For example, the re-ordering of units 1 and 2, can be dealt with using only syntactic models. However, as we will see in Section 2, there are significant differences between Japanese and English with respect to the way information is packaged and organized rhetorically not only at the sentence level, but also, at the paragraph and text levels. More specifically, as hutranslate Japanese into English, they the clauses, sentences, and paragraphs of Japanese they information into clauses, and paragraphs that not one-to-one mapping of the original Japanese units, and they re-organize structure of the translated text so as to reflect rhetorical constraints specific to English. If a translation system is to produce text that is not only grammatical but also coherent, it will have to ensure that the discourse structure of the target text reflects the natural renderings of the target language, and not that of the source language. In Section 2, we empirically show that there are significant differences between the rhetorical structure of Japanese texts and their corresponding English translations. These differences justify our investigation into developing computational models for discourse structure rewriting. In Section 3, we present such a rewriting model, which re-orders the the original text, determines English-specific clause, sentence, and paragraph boundaries, and rebuilds the Japanese discourse structure of a text using English-specific rhetorical renderings. In Section 4, we evaluate the performance of an implementation of this model. We end with a discussion. 2 Experiment In order to assess the role of discourse structure in MT, we built manually a corpus of discourse trees for 40 Japanese texts and their corresponding translations. The texts were selected randomly from the ARPA corpus (White and O'Connell, 1994). On average, each text had about 460 words. The Japanese texts had a total of 335 paragraphs and 773 sentences. The English texts had a total of 337 paragraphs and 827 sentences. We developed a discourse annotation protocol for Japanese and English along the lines followed by Marcu et al. (1999). We used Marcu's discourse annotation tool (1999) in order to manually construct the discourse structure of all Japanese and English texts in the corpus. 10% of the Japanese and English texts were rhetorically labeled by two of us. The tool and the annotation protocol are available annotation procedure yielded over the entire corpus Japanese edus and 2363 English We computed the reliability of the annotation using Marcu et al. (1999)'s method for computing kappa statistics (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) over hierarchical structures. Table 1 displays average kappa statistics that reflect the reliability of the annotaof elementary discourse units, spans, nuclearity assignhierarchical rhetorical relation asfigures higher than 0.8 correspond to good agreement; kappa figures higher than 0.6 correspond to acceptable agreement. All kappa statistics were statistically significant at levels higher than a = 0.01. In addition to the kappa statistics, table 1 also displays in parentheses the average number of data points per document, over which the kappa statistics were computed. For each pair of Japanese-English discourse structures, we also built manually an alignment file, which specified in the notation discussed on page 1 correspondence between the the Japanese and the its English translation. We computed the similarity between English and discourse trees using labeled recall and precision figures that reflected the resemblance of the Japanese and English discourse structures with reto their assignment of hierarchical spans, nuclearity, and rhetorical relations. Because the trees we compared differ from one language to the other in the number of elementary units, the order of these units, and the way the units are grouped recursively into discourse spans, we computed two types of recall and precision figures. computing recall and precision figures, a Japanese span was considered to match an English span when the Japanese span contained all the Japanese edus that corresponded to the the English span, and when the Japanese and English spans appeared in the same position with respect to the overall structure. For example, the English tree in figure 1 is characterized by 10 subsentential spans: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [1,2], [4,5], [3,5], and [1,5]. (Span [1,6] subsumes 2 sentences, so it is not sub-sentential.) The Japanese discourse tree has only 4 spans that could be matched in the same positions with English spans, namely spans [1,2], [4], [5], and [1,5]. Hence the similarity between the Japanese tree and the English tree with respect 11 Level Units Spans Status/Nuclearity Relations P-D R P-D P P-D R P-D P P-D R P-D P P-D R P-D P Sentence 29.1 25.0 27.2 22.7 21.3 17.7 14.9 12.4 Paragraph 53.9 53.4 46.8 47.3 38.6 39.0 31.9 32.3 Text 41.3 42.6 31.5 32.6 28.8 29.9 26.1 27.1 Weighted Average 36.0 32.5 31.8 28.4 26.0 23.1 20.1 17.9 All 8.2 7.4 5.9 5.3 4.4 3.9 3.3 3.0 P-I R P-I P P-I R P-I P P-I R P-I P P-I R P-I P Sentence 71.0 61.0 56.0 46.6 44.3 36.9 30.5 25.4 Paragraph 62.1 61.6 53.2 53.8 43.3 43.8 35.1 35.5 Text 74.1 76.5 54.4 56.5 48.5 50.4 41.1 42.7 Weighted Average 69.6 63.0 55.2 49.2 44.8 39.9 33.1 29.5 All 74.5 66.8 50.6 45.8 39.4 35.7 26.8 24.3 Table 2: Similarity of the Japanese and English discourse structures to their discourse structure below the sentence level has a recall of 4/10 and a precision of 4/11 (in Figure 1, there are 11 sub-sentential Japanese spans). computing recall and precision figures, even when a Japanese span &quot;floated&quot; during the translation to a position in the English tree that was different from the position in the initial tree, the P-I recall and precision figures were not affected. The Position-Independent figures the intuition that if two trees and a subtree and more similar than if they were if they didn't share any tree. At the sentence level, we hence assume that if, for example, the syntactic structure of a relative clause is translated appropriately (even though it is not appropriately attached), this is better than translating wrongly that clause. The Position-Independent figures offer a more optimistic metric for comparing discourse trees. They span a wider range of values than the Position-Dependent figures, which enable a finer grained comparison, which in turn enables a better characterization of the differences between Japanese and English discourse structures. When one takes an optimistic stance, for the spans at the sub-sentential level in the trees in Table 1 the recall is 6/10 and the precision is 6/11 because in addition to spans [1,2], [4], [5], and [1,5], one can also match Japanese span [1] to English span [2] and Japanese span [2] to Japanese span [1]. In order to provide a better estimate of how close two discourse trees were, we computed Position- Dependent and -Independent recall and precision figures for the sentential level (where units are given by spans are given by sets of edus or single sentences); paragraph level (where units are given by sentences and spans are given by sets of sentences or single paragraphs); and text level (where units are given by paragraphs and spans are given by sets of paragraphs). These figures offer a detailed picture of how discourse structures and relations are mapped from one language to the other across all discourse levels, from sentence to text. The differences at the sentence level can be explained by differences between the syntactic structures of Japanese and English. The differences at the paragraph and text levels have a purely rhetorical explanation. As expected, when we computed the recall and precision figures with respect to the nuclearity and relation assignments, we also factored in the statuses and the rhetorical relations that labeled each pair of spans. Table 2 summarizes the results (P-D and P- I (R)ecall and (P)recision figures) for each level (Sentence, Paragraph, and Text). The numbers in the &quot;Weighted Average&quot; line report averages of the Sentence-, Paragraph-, and Text-specific figures, weighted according to the number of units at each level. The numbers in the &quot;All&quot; line reflect recall and precision figures computed across the entire trees, with no attention paid to sentence and paragraph boundaries. Given the significantly different syntactic structures of Japanese and English, we were not surprised by the low recall and precision results that reflect the similarity between discourse trees built below the sentence level. However, as Table 2 shows, there are significant differences between discourse trees at the paragraph and text levels as well. For example, the Position-Independent figures show that only about 62% of the sentences and only about 53% of the hierarchical spans built across sentences could be matched between the two corpora. When one looks at the status and rhetorical relations associated with the spans built across sentences at the paragraph level, the P-I recall and precision figures drop to about 43% and 35% respectively. The differences in recall and precision are explained both by differences in the way information is packaged into paragraphs in the two languages and the way it is structured rhetorically both within and above the paragraph level. These results strongly suggest that if one attempts 12 to translate Japanese into English on a sentence-bysentence basis, it is likely that the resulting text will be unnatural from a discourse perspective. For exif some information rendered using a CONin Japanese is rendered using an in English, it would be inappropriate to use a discourse marker like &quot;but&quot; in the English translation, although that would be consistent with the Japanese discourse structure. An inspection of the rhetorical mappings between Japanese and English revealed that some Japanese rhetorical renderings are consistently mapped into one or a few preferred renderings in English. For ex- 34 of 115 in the Japanese are mapped into in En- 27 become nuclei of relations such as ANTITHEare translated as COMPAR- 6 as satellites of rela- 5 as etc. Our goal is to learn these systematic discourse mapping rules and exploit them in a machine translation context. 3 Towards a discourse-based machine translation system 3.1 Overall architecture We are currently working towards building the modules of a Discourse-Based Machine Translation system that works along the following lines. 1. A discourse parser, such as those described by Sumita et al. (1992), Kurohashi (1994), and Marcu (1999), initially derives the discourse structure of the text given as input. 2. A discourse-structure transfer module rewrites the discourse structure of the input text so as to reflect a discourse rendering that is natural to the target language. 3. A statistical module maps the input text into the target language using translation and language models that incorporate discoursespecific features, which are extracted from the outputs of the discourse parser and discourse transfer modules. In this paper, we focus only on the discoursestructure transfer module. That is, we investigate the feasibility of building such a module. 3.2 The discourse-based transfer model In order to learn to rewrite discourse structure trees, we first address a related problem, which we define below: 3.1 two trees T, and T, and a Table C defined between T, and the leaf level in terms of D, relations, of actions that rewrites the tree T. into I. for any tuple T, such a sequence of actions can be derived, it is then possible to use a corpus TC) in order to automatically learn derive from an unseen tree has the structural properties as the trees tree which has structural properties similar to those of the trees T. In order to solve the problem in definition 3.1, we extend the shift-reduce parsing paradigm applied by Magerman (1995), Hermjakob and Mooney (1997), and Marcu (1999). In this extended paradigm, the transfer process starts with an empty Stack and an Input List that contains a sequence of elementary trees each the tree as input. The status and rhetorical relaassociated with each undefined. At each step, the transfer module applies an operation that is at building from the units in discourse the context of our discourse-transfer module, we need 7 types of operations: SHIFT transfer the first the input list into the stack; REDUCE pop the two discourse trees located at the top of the stack; combine them into a new tree updating the statuses and rhetorical relation names of the trees involved in the operation; and push the new tree on the top of the stack. These operations are used to build the structure of the discourse tree in the target language. BREAK are used in order to break the beginning of the input list into a predetermined number of units. These operations are used to ensure that the resulttree has the same number of is necessary whenever a mapped into multiple English units. CREATE-NEXT are used in order to create English discourse constituents that have no correspondent in the Japanese tree. FUSE are used in order to fuse the the top of the stack into the tree that immediately precedes it. These operations used whenever multiple Japanese into one English SWAP swap the the beginof the input list with an one or more positions to the right. These operations are necessary for re-ordering discourse constituents. ASSIGNTYPE assign one or more of the following types to the tree at the top of the stack: Unit, MultiUnit, Sentence, Para- MultiParagraph, and Text. These op- 13 erations are necessary in order to ensure sentence and paragraph boundaries that are specific to the target language. For example, the first sentence of the English tree in Figure 1 can be obtained from the original Japanese sequence by following the sequence of actions (5), whose effects are shown in Figure 2. For the purpose of compactness, the figure does not illustrate the effect of ASSIGNTYPE actions. For the same purpose, some lines correspond to more than one action.

For our corpus, in order to enable a discoursebased transfer module to derive any English discourse tree starting from any Japanese discourse tree, it is sufficient to implement: • one SHIFT operation; • 3 x 2 x 85 REDUCE operations; (For each of the three possible pairs of nuclearity assignments NUCLEUS-SATELLITE (NS), SATELLITE-NUCLEUS (SN), AND NUCLEUS- NUCLEUS (NN), there are two possible ways to reduce two adjacent trees (one results in a binary tree, the other in a non-binary tree (Marcu, 1999)), and 85 relation names.) • three types of BREAK operations; (In our corpus, a Japanese unit is broken into two, three, or at most four units.) • one type of CREATE-NEXT operation; • one type of FUSE operation; • eleven types of SWAP operations; (In our corpus, Japanese units are at most 11 positions away from their location in an Englishspecific rendering.) • seven types of ASSIGNTYPE operations: Unit, MultiUnit, Sentence, MultiSentence, Paraand Text. These actions are sufficient for rewriting any tree any tree may have a different of the Tt may have a ordering than the edus of where the hierarchical structures of the two trees may be different as well. 3.3 Learning the parameters of the discourse-transfer model We associate with each configuration of our transfer model a learning case. The cases were generated by a program that automatically derived the sequence of actions that mapped the Japanese trees in our corpus into the sibling English trees, using the correspondences at the elementary unit level that were constructed manually. Overall, the 40 pairs of Japanese and English discourse trees yielded 14108 cases. To each learning example, we associated a set of features from the following classes: and discourse features the of trees in the stack, the and the types of the last five operations. They encode information pertaining to the types of the partial trees built up to a certain time and the rhetorical relations that hold between these trees. features the nuclearity, rhetorical relations, and types of the Japanese trees that correspond to the English-like partial trees derived up to a given time. features whether the Japanese spans that correspond to the structures derived up to a given time use potential dismarkers, such as dakara nz The discourse transfer module uses the C4.5 program (Quinlan, 1993) in order to learn decision trees and rules that specify how Japanese discourse trees should be mapped into English-like trees. A ten-fold cross-validation evaluation of the classifier yielded an accuracy of 70.2% (± 0.21). In order to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the classifier, we also attempted to break the problem into smaller components. Hence, instead of learning all actions at once, we attempted to learn first whether the rewriting procedure should a SHIFT, REDUCE, BREAK, FUSE, SWAP, ASSIGNTYPE operation (the &quot;Main Action Type&quot; classifier in table 3), and only then to refine this decision by determining what type of reduce operation to perform, how many units to break a Japanese units into, how big the distance to the stvAP-ed unit should be, and what type of ASSIGNTYPE operation one should perform.

For the purpose of comparison, each classifier is paired with a majority baseline. The results in Table 3 show that the most difficult subtasks to learn are that of determining the number of units a Japanese unit should be broken into and that of determining the distance to the unit that is to be swapped. The features we used are not able to refine the baseline classifiers for these action types. The confusion matrix for the &quot;Main Action Type&quot; classifier (see Table 5) shows that the has trouble mostly identifying The system has difficulty learning what type of nuclearity ordering to prefer (the &quot;Nuclearity-Reduce&quot; classifier) and what relation to choose for the English-like structure (the &quot;Relation-Reduce&quot; classifier). Figure 3 shows a typical learning curve, the one that corresponds to the &quot;Reduce Relation&quot; classifier. Our learning curves suggest that more training data may improve performance. However, they also suggest that better features may be needed in order to improve performance significantly. Table 4 displays some learned rules. The first rule accounts for rhetorical mappings in which the orof the nucleus and satellite of an relation is changed when translated from Japanese into English. The second rule was learned in order map satellites into English satellites.

To evaluate the discourse-based transfer module, we carried out a ten-fold cross-validation experiment. That is, we trained the classifiers on 36 pairs of manually built and aligned discourse structures, and we then used the learned classifiers in order to map 4 unseen Japanese discourse trees into English-like trees. We measured the similarity of the derived trees with the English trees built manually, using the metrics discussed in Section 2. We repeated the procedure ten times, each time training and testing on different subsets of tree pairs. We take the results reported in Table 2 as a baseline for our model. The baseline corresponds to applying no knowledge of discourse. Table 6 displays the absolute improvement (in percentage points) in recall and precision figures obtained when the General classifier was used to map Japanese trees into English-looking trees. The General classifier yielded the best results. The results in Table 6 are averaged over a ten-fold cross-validation experiment. The results in Table 6 show that our model outperforms the baseline with respect to building English-like discourse structures for sentences, but it under-performs the baseline with respect to building English-like structures at the paragraph and text levels. The main shortcoming of our model seems to come from its low performance in assigning paragraph boundaries. Because our classifier does not learn correctly which spans to consider paragraphs and which spans not, the recall and precision results at the paragraph and text levels are negatively affected. The poorer results at the paragraph and text levels can be also explained by errors whose effect cumulates during the step-by-step tree-reconstruction procedure; and by the fact that, for these levels, there is less data to learn from. However, if one ignores the sentence and paragraph boundaries and evaluates the discourse structures overall, one can see that our model outperforms the baseline on all accounts according to the Position-Dependent evaluation; outperforms the baseline with respect to the assignment of elementary units, hierarchical spans, and nuclearity statuses according to the Position-Independent evaluation and under-performs the baseline only slightly 16 Level Units Spans Status/Nuclearity Relations P-D R P-D P P-D R P-D P P-D R P-D P P-D R P-D P Sentence +9.1 +25.5 +2.0 +19.9 +0.4 +13.4 -0.01 +8.4 Paragraph -14.7 +1.4 -12.5 -1.7 -11.0 -2.4 -9.9 -3.3 Text -9.6 -13.5 -7.1 -11.1 -6.3 -10.0 -5.2 -8.8 Weighted Average +1.5 +14.1 -2.1 +9.9 -3.1 +6.4 -3.0 +3.9 All -1.2 +2.5 -0.1 +2.9 +0.6 +3.5 +0.7 +2.6 P-I R P-1 P P-I R P-I P P-I R P-I P P-I R P-I P Sentence +13.4 +30.4 +3.1 +36.1 -6.3 +18.6 -10.1 +3.9 Paragraph -15.6 +0.6 -13.5 -0.8 -11.7 -1.8 -10.3 -2.8 Text -15.4 -23.3 -13.0 -20.4 -13.2 -19.5 -11.5 -17.0 Weighted Average +3.6 +15.5 -2.7 +17.1 -8.5 +7.3 -10.5 -0.4 All +12.7 +29.6 +2.0 +28.8 -5.1 +13.0 -7.9 +2.2 Table 6: Relative evaluation of the discourse-based transfer module with respect to the figures in Table 2. with respect to the rhetorical relation assignment according to the Position-Independent evaluation. More sophisticated discourse features, such as those discussed by Maynard (1998), for example, and a tighter integration with the lexicogrammar of the two languages may yield better cues for learning discourse-based translation models. 5 Conclusion We presented a systematic empirical study of the role of discourse structure in MT. Our study strongly supports the need for enriching MT systems with a discourse module, capable of re-ordering and repackaging the information in a source text in a way that is consistent with the discourse rendering of a target language. We presented an extended shiftreduce parsing model that can be used to map discourse trees specific to a source language into discourse trees specific to a target language. Our model outperforms a baseline with respect to its ability to predict the discourse structure of sentences. Our model also outperforms the baseline with respect to its ability to derive discourse structures that are closer to the natural, rhetorical rendering in a target language than the original discourse structures in the source language. Our model is still unable to determine correctly how to re-package sentences into paragraphs; a better understanding of the notion of &quot;paragraph&quot; is required in order to improve this.

iscourse structure trees, we learn to rewrite Japanese trees as trees that are closer to the natural English rendering than the original ones. 1 Motivation Almost all current MT systems process text one sentence at a time. Because of this limited focus, MT systems cannot re-group and re-order the clauses and sentences of an input text to achieve the most natural rendering in a target language. Yet, even between languages as close as English and French, there is a 10% mismatch in number of sentences — what is said in two sentences in one language is said in only one, or in three, in the other (Gale and Church, 1993). For distant language pairs, such as Japanese and English, the differences are more significant. Consider, for example, Japanese sentence (1), a word-by-word &quot;gloss&quot; of it (2), and a two-sentence translation of it that was produced by a professional translator (3).

Hence, the mappings in (4) provide an explicit representation of the way information is re-ordered and re-packaged when translated from Japanese into English. However, when translating text, it is also the case that the rhetorical rendering changes. What is realized in Japanese using an CONTRAST relation can be realized in English using, for example, a COMPARISON or a CONCESSION relation. Figure 1 presents in the style of Mann and Thompson (1988) the discourse structures of text fragments (1) and (3). Each discourse structure is a tree whose leaves correspond to the edus and whose internal nodes correspond to contiguous text spans. Each node is characterized by a status (NUCLEUS or SATELLITE) and a rhetorical relation, which is a relation that holds between two non-overlapping text spans. The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's intention than the satellite; and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is comprehensible indepen

We end with a discussion. 2 Experiment In order to assess the role of discourse structure in MT, we built manually a corpus of discourse trees for 40 Japanese texts and their corresponding translations. The texts were selected randomly from the ARPA corpus (White and O'Connell, 1994). On average, each text had about 460 words. The Japanese texts had a total of 335 paragraphs and 773 sentences. The English texts had a total of 337 paragraphs and 827 sentences. We developed a discourse annotation protocol for Japanese and English along the lines followed by Marcu et al. (1999). We used Marcu's discourse annotation tool (1999) in order to manually construct the discourse structure of all Japanese and English texts in the corpus. 10% of the Japanese and English texts were rhetorically labeled by two of us. The tool and the annotation protocol are available at http://www.isi.edu/—marcu/software/. The annotation procedure yielded over the entire corpus 2641 Japanese edus and 2363 English edus. We computed the reliability of the annotation using Marcu et al. (1999)'s method for computing kappa statistics (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) over hierarchical structures. Table 1

The texts were selected randomly from the ARPA corpus (White and O'Connell, 1994). On average, each text had about 460 words. The Japanese texts had a total of 335 paragraphs and 773 sentences. The English texts had a total of 337 paragraphs and 827 sentences. We developed a discourse annotation protocol for Japanese and English along the lines followed by Marcu et al. (1999). We used Marcu's discourse annotation tool (1999) in order to manually construct the discourse structure of all Japanese and English texts in the corpus. 10% of the Japanese and English texts were rhetorically labeled by two of us. The tool and the annotation protocol are available at http://www.isi.e
