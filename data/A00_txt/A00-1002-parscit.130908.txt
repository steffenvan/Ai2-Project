Abstract
Using examples of the transfer-based MT
system between Czech and Russian
RUSLAN and the word-for-word MT system
with morphological disambiguation between
Czech and Slovak CESILKO we argue that
for really close languages it is possible to
obtain better translation quality by means of
simpler methods. The problem of translation
to a group of typologically similar languages
using a pivot language is also discussed here.
Introduction
Although the field of machine translation has a
very long history, the number of really successful
systems is not very impressive. Most of the funds
invested into the development of various MT
systems have been wasted and have not
stimulated a development of techniques which
would allow to translate at least technical texts
from a certain limited domain. There were, of
course, exceptions, which demonstrated that
under certain conditions it is possible to develop
a system which will save money and efforts
invested into human translation. The main reason
why the field of MT has not met the expectations
of sci-fi literature, but also the expectations of
scientific community, is the complexity of the
task itself. A successful automatic translation
system requires an application of techniques from
several areas of computational linguistics
(morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse
analysis etc.) as a necessary, but not a sufficient
condition. The general opinion is that it is easier
to create an MT system for a pair of related
languages. In our contribution we would like to
demonstrate that this assumption holds only for
really very closely related languages.
1. Czech-to-Russian MT system RUSLAN
1.1 History
The first attempt to verify the hypothesis that
related languages are easier to translate started in
mid 80s at Charles University in Prague. The
project was called RUSLAN and aimed at the
translation of documentation in the domain of
operating systems for mainframe computers. It
was developed in cooperation with the Research
Institute of Mathematical Machines in Prague. At
that time in former COMECON countries it was
obligatory to translate any kind of documentation
to such systems into Russian. The work on the
Czech-to-Russian MT system RUSLAN (cf. Oliva
(1989)) started in 1985. It was terminated in 1990
(with COMECON gone) for the lack of funding.
1.2 System description
The system was rule-based, implemented in
Colmerauer's Q-systems. It contained a fullfledged morphological and syntactic analysis of
Czech, a transfer and a syntactic and
morphological generation of Russian. There was
almost no transfer at the beginning of the project
due to the assumption that both languages are
similar to the extent that does not require any
transfer phase at all. This assumption turned to be
wrong and several phenomena were covered by
the transfer in the later stage of the project (for
example the translation of the Czech verb &quot;b)rt&quot;
[to be] into one of the three possible Russian
equivalents: empty form, the form &quot;byt6&quot; in future
7
tense and the verb &quot;javljat6sja&quot;; or the translation
of verbal negation).
At the time when the work was terminated in
1990, the system had a main translation
dictionary of about 8000 words, accompanied by
so called transducing dictionary covering another
2000 words. The transducing dictionary was
based on the original idea described in Kirschner
(1987). It aimed at the exploitation of the fact
that technical terms are based (in a majority of
European languages) on Greek or Latin stems,
adopted according to the particular derivational
rules of the given languages. This fact allows for
the &quot;translation&quot; of technical terms by means of a
direct transcription of productive endings and a
slight (regular) adjustment of the spelling of the
stem. For example, the English words
localization and discrimination can be
transcribed into Czech as &quot;lokalizace&quot; and
&quot;diskriminace&quot; with a productive ending —ation
being transcribed to —ace. It was generally
assumed that for the pair Czech/Russian the
transducing dictionary would be able to profit
from a substantially greater number of productive
rules. This hypothesis proved to be wrong, too
(see Bemova, Kubon (1990)). The set of
productive endings for both pairs (English/Czech,
as developed for an earlier MT system from
English to Czech, and Czech/Russian) was very
similar.
The evaluation of results of RUSLAN showed
that roughly 40% of input sentences were
translated correctly, about 40% with minor errors
correctable by a human post-editor and about
20% of the input required substantial editing or
re-translation. There were two main factors that
caused a deterioration of the translation. The first
factor was the incompleteness of the main
dictionary of the system. Even though the system
contained a set of so-called fail-soft rules, whose
task was to handle such situations, an unknown
word typically caused a failure of the module of
syntactic analysis, because the dictionary entries
contained - besides the translation equivalents
and morphological information - very important
syntactic information.
The second factor was the module of syntactic
analysis of Czech. There were several reasons of
parsing failures. Apart from the common inability
of most rule-based formal grammars to cover a
particular natural language to the finest detail of
its syntax there were other problems. One of them
was the existence of non-projective constructions,
which are quite common in Czech even in
relatively short sentences. Even though they
account only for 1.7% of syntactic dependencies,
every third Czech sentence contains at least one,
and in a news corpus, we discovered as much as
15 non-projective dependencies; see also Hajie et
al. (1998). An example of a non-projective
construction is &quot;Soubor se nepodafilo otevfit.&quot;
[lit.: File Refl. was_not_possible to_open. — It was
not possible to open the file]. The formalism used
for the implementation (Q-systems) was not meant
to handle non-projective constructions. Another
source of trouble was the use of so-called
semantic features. These features were based on
lexical semantics of individual words. Their main
task was to support a semantically plausible
analysis and to block the implausible ones. It
turned out that the question of implausible
combinations of semantic features is also more
complex than it was supposed to be. The practical
outcome of the use of semantic features was a
higher ratio of parsing failures — semantic features
often blocked a plausible analysis. For example,
human lexicographers assigned the verb 'to run' a
semantic feature stating that only a noun with
semantic features of a human or other living being
may be assigned the role of subject of this verb.
The input text was however full of sentences with
'programs' or 'systems' running etc. It was of
course very easy to correct the semantic feature in
the dictionary, but the problem was that there
were far too many corrections required.
On the other hand, the fact that both languages
allow a high degree of word-order freedom
accounted for a certain simplification of the
translation process. The grammar relied on the
fact that there are only minor word-order
differences between Czech and Russian.
1.3 Lessons learned from RUSLAN
We have learned several lessons regarding the MT
of closely related languages:
• The transfer-based approach provides a
similar quality of translation both for closely
related and typologically different languages
• Two main bottlenecks of full-fledged
transfer-based systems are:
8
- complexity of the syntactic dictionary
- relative unreliability of the syntactic
analysis of the source language
• Even a relatively simple component
(transducing dictionary) was equally complex
for English-to-Czech and Czech-to-Russian
translation
• Limited text domains do not exist in real life,
it is necessary to work with a high coverage
dictionary at least for the source language.
2. Translation and localization
2.1 A pivot language
Localization of products and their documentation
is a great problem for any company, which wants
to strengthen its position on foreign language
market, especially for companies producing
various kinds of software. The amounts of texts
being localized are huge and the localization
costs are huge as well.
It is quite clear that the localization from one
source language to several target languages,
which are typologically similar, but different
from the source language, is a waste of money
and effort. It is of course much easier to translate
texts from Czech to Polish or from Russian to
Bulgarian than from English or German to any of
these languages. There are several reasons, why
localization and translation is not being
performed through some pivot language,
representing a certain group of closely related
languages. Apart from political reasons the
translation through a pivot language has several
drawbacks. The most important one is the
problem of the loss of translation quality. Each
translation may to a certain extent shift the
meaning of the translated text and thus each
subsequent translation provides results more and
more different from the original. The second
most important reason is the lack of translators
from the pivot to the target language, while this is
usually no problem for the translation from the
source directly to the target language.
2.2 Translation memory is the key
The main goal of this paper is to suggest how to
overcome these obstacles by means of a
combination of an MT system with commercial
MAHT (Machine-aided human translation)
systems. We have chosen the TRADOS
Translator's Workbench as a representative
system of a class of these products, which can be
characterized as an example-based translation
tools. IBM's Translation Manager and other
products also belong to this class. Such systems
uses so-called translation memory, which contains
pairs of previously translated sentences from a
source to a target language. When a human
translator starts translating a new sentence, the
system tries to match the source with sentences
already stored in the translation memory. If it is
successful, it suggests the translation and the
human translator decides whether to use it, to
modify it or to reject it.
The segmentation of a translation memory is a key
feature for our system. The translation memory
may be exported into a text file and thus allows
easy manipulation with its content. Let us suppose
that we have at our disposal two translation
memories — one human made for the source/pivot
language pair and the other created by an MT
system for the pivot/target language pair. The
substitution of segments of a pivot language by
the segments of a target language is then only a
routine procedure. The human translator
translating from the source language to the target
language then gets a translation memory for the
required pair (source/target). The system of
penalties applied in TRADOS Translator's
Workbench (or a similar system) guarantees that if
there is already a human-made translation present,
then it gets higher priority than the translation
obtained as a result of the automatic MT. This
system solves both problems mentioned above —
the human translators from the pivot to the target
language are not needed at all and the machinemade translation memory serves only as a
resource supporting the direct human translation
from the source to the target language.
3. Machine translation of (very) closely
related Slavic languages
In the group of Slavic languages, there are more
closely related languages than Czech and Russian.
Apart from the pair of Serbian and Croatian
languages, which are almost identical and were
9
considered one language just a few years ago, the
most closely related languages in this group are
Czech and Slovak.
This fact has led us to an experiment with
automatic translation between Czech and Slovak.
It was clear that application of a similar method
to that one used in the system RUSLAN would
lead to similar results. Due to the closeness of
both languages we have decided to apply a
simpler method. Our new system, CESILKO,
aims at a maximal exploitation of the similarity
of both languages. The system uses the method of
direct word-for-word translation, justified by the
similarity of syntactic constructions of both
languages.
Although the system is currently being tested on
texts from the domain of documentation to
corporate information systems, it is not limited to
• any specific domain. Its primary task is, however,
to provide support for translation and localization
of various technical texts.
3.1 System t ESILKO
The greatest problem of the word-for-word
translation approach (for languages with very
similar syntax and word order, but different
morphological system) is the problem of
morphological ambiguity of individual word
forms. The type of ambiguity is slightly different
in languages with a rich inflection (majority of
Slavic languages) and in languages which do not
have such a wide variety of forms derived from a
single lemma. For example, in Czech there are
only rare cases of part-of-speech ambiguities (stat
[to stay/the state], zena [woman/chasing] or tri
[three/rub(imperative)]), much more frequent is
the ambiguity of gender, number and case (for
example, the form of the adjective jarni [spring]
is 27-times ambiguous). The main problem is that
even though several Slavic languages have the
same property as Czech, the ambiguity is not
preserved. It is distributed in a different manner
and the &quot;form-for-form&quot; translation is not
applicable.
Without the analysis of at least nominal groups it
is often very difficult to solve this problem,
because for example the actual morphemic
categories of adjectives are in Czech
distinguishable only on the basis of gender,
number and case agreement between an adjective
and its governing noun. An alternative way to the
solution of this problem was the application of a
stochastically based morphological disambiguator
(morphological tagger) for Czech whose success
rate is close to 92%. Our system therefore consists
of the following modules:
1. Import of the input from so-called 'empty'
translation memory
2. Morphological analysis of Czech
3. Morphological disambiguation
4. Domain-related bilingual glossaries (incl.
single- and multiword terminology)
5. General bilingual dictionary
6. Morphological synthesis of Slovak
7. Export of the output to the original translation
memory
Let us now look in a more detail at the individual
modules of the system:
ad 1. The input text is extracted out of a
translation memory previously exported into an
ASCII file. The exported translation memory (of
TRADOS) has a SGML-like notation with a
relatively simple structure (cf. the following
example):
Example 1. — A sample of the exported translation
memory
<RTF Preamble>...</RTF Preamble>
<TrU>
<CrD>23051999
<CrU>VK
<Seg L=CS_01>Pomoci vSlazu ad-hoc mulete
rychle a jednodu§e vytvafet rekeSe.
<Seg L=SK_Ol>n/a
</TrU>
Our system uses only the segments marked by
<Seg L=CS_O 1>, which contain one source
language sentence each, and <Seg L=SK_O 1>,
which is empty and which will later contain the
same sentence translated into the target language
by CESiLKO.
ad 2. The morphological analysis of Czech is
based on the morphological dictionary developed
by Jan Hajie and Hana Skoumalova in 1988-99
(for latest description, see Haji 6 (1998)). The
dictionary contains over 700 000 dictionary
entries and its typical coverage varies between
10
99% (novels) to 95% (technical texts). The
morphological analysis uses the system of
positional tags with 15 positions (each
morphological .category, such as Part-of-speech,
Number, Gender, Case, etc. has a fixed, singlesymbol place in the tag).
Example 2 — tags assigned to the word-form
&quot;pomoci&quot; (help/by means of)
pomoci:
NFP2 A - I NFS7 A I R-2
where:
N — noun; R — preposition
F — feminine gender
S — singular, P — plural
7, 2 — case (7 - instrumental, 2 - genitive)
A — affirmative (non negative)
ad 3. The module of morphological
disambiguation is a key to the success of the
translation. It gets an average number of 3.58
tags per token (word form in text) as an input.
The tagging system is purely statistical, and it
uses a log-linear model of probability distribution
— see Haji, Hladka (1998). The learning is based
on a manually tagged corpus of Czech texts
(mostly from the general newspaper domain).
The system learns contextual rules (features)
automatically and also automatically determines
feature weights. The average accuracy of tagging
is between 91 and 93% and remains the same
even for technical texts (if we disregard the
unknown names and foreign-language terms that
are not ambiguous anyway).
The lemmatization immediately follows tagging;
it chooses the first lemma with a possible tag
corresponding to the tag selected. Despite this
simple lemmatization method, and also thanks to
the fact that Czech words are rarely ambiguous in
their Part-of-speech, it works with an accuracy
exceeding 98%.
ad 4. The domain-related bilingual glossaries
contain pairs of individual words and pairs of
multiple-word terms. The glossaries are
organized into a hierarchy specified by the user;
typically, the glossaries for the most specific
domain are applied first. There is one general
matching rule for all levels of glossaries — the
longest match wins.
The multiple-word terms are sequences of lemmas
(not word forms). This structure has several
advantages, among others it allows to minimize
the size of the dictionary and also, due to the
simplicity of the structure, it allows modifications
of the glossaries by the linguistically naive user.
The necessary morphological information is
introduced into the domain-related glossary in an
off-line preprocessing stage, which does not
require user intervention. This makes a big
difference when compared to the RUSLAN
Czech-to-Russian MT system, when each
multiword dictionary entry cost about 30 minutes
of linguistic expert's time on average.
ad 5. The main bilingual dictionary contains data
necessary for the translation of both lemmas and
tags. The translation of tags (from the Czech into
the Slovak morphological system) is necessary,
because due to the morphological differences both
systems use close, but slightly different tagsets.
Currently the system handles the 1:1 translation of
tags (and 2:2, 3:3, etc.). Different ratio of
translation is very rare between Czech and Slovak,
but nevertheless an advanced system of dictionary
items is under construction (for the translation 1:2,
2:1 etc.). It is quite interesting that the lexically
homonymous words often preserve their
homonymy even after the translation, so no
special treatment of homonyms is deemed
necessary.
ad 6. The morphological synthesis of Slovak is
based on a monolingual dictionary of Slovak,
developed by J.Hric (1991-99), covering more
than 100,000 dictionary entries. The coverage of
the dictionary is not as high as of the Czech one,
but it is still growing. It aims at a similar coverage
of Slovak as we enjoy for Czech.
ad 7. The export of the output of the system
CESILKO into the translation memory (of
TRADOS Translator's Workbench) amounts
mainly to cleaning of all irrelevant SGML
markers. The whole resulting Slovak sentence is
inserted into the appropriate location in the
original translation memory file. The following
example also shows that the marker <CrU>
contains an information that the target language
sentence was created by an MT system.

3.2 Evaluation of results
The problem how to evaluate results of automatic
translation is very difficult. For the evaluation of
our system we have exploited the close
connection between our system and the
TRADOS Translator's Workbench. The method
is simple – the human translator receives the
translation memory created by our system and
translates the text using this memory. The
translator is free to make any changes to the text
proposed by the translation memory. The target
text created by a human translator is then
compared with the text created by the mechanical
application of translation memory to the source
text. TRADOS then evaluates the percentage of
matching in the same manner as it normally
evaluates the percentage of matching of source
text with sentences in translation memory. Our
system achieved about 90% match (as defined by
the TRADOS match module) with the results of
human translation, based on a relatively large
(more than 10,000 words) test sample.
4. Conclusions
The accuracy of the translation achieved by our
system justifies the hypothesis that word-forword translation might be a solution for MT of
really closely related languages. The remaining
problems to be solved are problems with the oneto many or many-to-many translation, where the
lack of information in glossaries and dictionaries
sometimes causes an unnecessary translation
error.
The success of the system tESILKO has
encouraged the investigation of the possibility to
use the same method for other pairs of Slavic
languages, namely for Czech-to-Polish translation.
Although these languages are not so similar as
Czech and Slovak, we hope that an addition of a
simple partial noun phrase parsing might provide
results with the quality comparable to the fullfledged syntactic analysis based system RUSLAN
(this is of course true also for the Czech-to-Slovak
translation). The first results of Czech-to Polish
translation are quite encouraging in this respect,
even though we could not perform as rigorous
testing as we did for Slovak.
