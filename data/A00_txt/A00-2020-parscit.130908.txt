Abstract
We present a method for automatically detecting errors in a manually marked corpus using anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is
a method for determining which elements of a
large data set do not conform to the whole.
This method fits a probability distribution over
the data and applies a statistical test to detect
anomalous elements. In the corpus error detection problem, anomalous elements are typically
marking errors. We present the results of applying this method to the tagged portion of the
Penn Treebank corpus.
1 Introduction
Manually marking corpora is a time consuming
and expensive process. The process is subject to
human error by the experts doing the marking.
Unfortunately, many natural language processing methods are sensitive to these errors. In
order to ensure accuracy in a corpus, typically
several experts pass over the corpus to ensure
consistency. For large corpora this can be a
tremendous expense.
In this paper, we propose a method for automatically detecting errors in a marked corpus using an anomaly detection technique. This
technique detects anomalies or elements which
do not fit in with the rest of the corpus. When
applied to marked corpora, the anomalies tend
to be errors in the markings of the corpus.
To detect the anomalies, we first compute a
probability distribution over the entire corpus.
Then we apply a statistical test which identifies which elements are anomalies. In this case
the anomalies are the elements with very low
likelihood. These elements are marked as errors
and are thrown out of the corpus. The model is
recomputed on the remaining elements. At conclusion, we are left with two data sets: one the
normal elements and the second the detected
anomalous elements.
We evaluate this method over the part of
speech tagged portion of the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993). In one experiment,
our method detected 1000 anomalies within a
data set of 1.25 million tagged elements. Human
judges evaluated the results of the application
of this method and verified that 69% of identified anomalies are in fact tagging errors. In
another experiment, our method detected 4000
anomalies of which 44% are tagging errors.
1.1 Related Work
The tagged portion of the Penn Treebank
has been extensively utilized for construction
and evaluation of taggers. This includes
transformation-based tagging (Brill, 1994; Brill
and Wu, 1998). Weischedel et al. (1993) applied
Markov Models to tagging. Abney et al. (1999)
applied boosting to part of speech tagging. Adwait Ratnaparkhi (1996) estimates a probability distribution for tagging using a maximum
entropy approach.
Regarding error detection in corpora, Ratnaparkhi (1996) discusses inconsistencies in
the Penn Treebank and relates them to interannotator differences in tagging style. Abney,
Schapire and Singer (1999) discuss how to use
boosting for cleaning data.
Much related work to the anomaly detection
problem stems from the field of statistics in
the study of outliers. This work examines detecting and dealing with outliers in univariate
data, multivariate data, and structured data
where the probability distribution over the data
is given a priori. Statistics gives a set of discordancy tests which can be applied to any given
element in the dataset to determine whether it
is an outlier. A survey of outliers in statistics is
148
given in Barnett and Lewis (1994).
Anomaly detection is extensively used within
the field of computer security specifically in intrusion detection (Denning, 1987). Typically
anomaly detection methods are applied to detect attacks by comparing the activity during an
attack to the activity under normal use (Lane
and Brodley, 1997; Warrender et al., 1999). The
method used in this paper is based on a method
for anomaly detection which detects anomalies
in noisy data (Eskin, 2000).
The sparse Markov transducer probability
modeling method is an extension of adaptive
mixtures of probabilistic transducers (Singer,
1997; Pereira and Singer, 1999). Naive Bayes
learning, which is used to estimate probabilities
in this paper, is described in (Mitchell, 1997).
2 Anomaly Detection
More formally, anomaly detection is the process
of determining when an element of data is an
outlier. Given a set of training data without a
probability distribution, we want to construct
an automatic method for detecting anomalies.
We are interested in detecting anomalies for two
main reasons. One, we are interested in modeling the data and the anomalies can contaminate
the model. And two, the anomalies themselves
can be of interest as they may show rarely occurring events. For the purposes of this work,
we are most interested in identifying mistagged
elements, i.e. the second case.
In order to motivate a method for detecting anomalies, we must first make assumptions
about how the anomalies occur in the data. We
use a &quot;mixture model&quot; for explaining the presence of anomalies, one of several popular models
in statistics for explaining outliers (Barnett and
Lewis, 1994). In the mixture model, there are
two probability distributions which generate the
data. An element xi is either generated from the
majority distribution or with (small) probability A from an alternate (anomalous) distribution. Our distribution for the data, D, is then:
D (1 — A)M + AA (1)
where M is the majority distribution, and A
is the anomalous distribution. The mixture
framework for explaining anomalies is independent of the properties of the distributions M
and A. In other words, no assumptions about
the nature of the probability distributions are
necessary. The specific probability distributions, M and A, are chosen based on prior
knowledge of the problem. Typically M is a
structured distribution which is estimated over
the data using a machine learning technique,
while A is a uniform (random) distribution representing elements which do not fit into M.
In the corpus error detection problem, we are
assuming that for each tag in the corpus with
probability (1 — A) the human annotator markes
the corpus with the correct tag and with probability A the human annotator makes an error.
In the case of an error, we assume that the tag
is chosen at random.
2.1 Detection of Anomalies
Detecting anomalies, in this framework, is
equivalent to determining which elements were
generated by the distribution A and which elements were generated by distribution M. Elements generated by A are anomalies, while elements generated by M are not. In our case, we
have probability distributions associated with
the distributions M and A, Pm and PA respectively.
The algorithm partitions the data into two
sets, the normal elements M and the anomalies
A. For each element, we make a determination
of whether it is an anomaly and should be included in A or a majority element in which it
should be included in M. We measure the likelihood of the distribution under both cases to
make this determination.
The likelihood, L, of distribution D with
probability function P over elements xi,...,xN
is defined as follows:
L(D) = PD(xi)
— A)IM II Pm(xi)) PA(Xj))
xiEM x1•EA
Since the product of small numbers is difficult
to compute, we instead compute the log likelihood, LL. The log likelihood for our case is:
LL(D) =I* log(1 — A) + E log(Pm(xi))
x,EM
+IAI log A + E log(PA (xi)) (3)
x EA
(2)
149
In order to determine which elements are
anomalies, we use a general principal for determining outliers in multivariate data (Barnett,
1979). We measure how likely each element xi is
an outlier by comparing the difference between
the log likelihood of the distribution if the element is removed from the majority distribution
and included in the anomalous distribution. If
this difference is sufficiently large, we declare
the element an anomaly.
Specifically what this difference should be depends on the probability distributions and prior
knowledge of the problem such as the rate of the
anomalies, A.
3 Methodology
3.1 Corpus
The corpus we use is the Penn Treebank tagged
corpus. The corpus contains approximately 1.25
million manually tagged words from Wall Street
Journal articles. For each word, a record is generated containing the following elements:
1. The tag of the current word T.
2. The current word Wi.
3. The previous tag Ti_1.
4. The next tag
Over records containing these 4 elements, we
compute our probability distributions.
3.2 Probability Modeling Methods
The anomaly detection framework is independent of specific probability distributions. Different probability distributions have different
properties. Since the anomaly detection framework does not depend on a specific probability
distribution, we can choose the probability distribution to best model the data based on our
intuitions about the problem.
To illustrate this, we perform two sets of experiments, each using a different probability distribution modeling method. The first set of
experiments uses sparse Markov transducers as
the probability modeling method, while the second uses a simple naive Bayes method.
3.3 Sparse Markov Transducers
Sparse Malloy transducers compute probabilistic mappings over sparse data. A Markov transducer is defined to be a probability distribution
conditional on a finite set of inputs. A Markov
transducer of order L is the conditional probability distribution of the form:
P(YtiXtXt_iXt-2Xt-3...Xt- (L-1) ) (4)
where Xk are random variables over the input alphabet Eiu and Yk is a random variable
over the output alphabet Eout. This probability
distribution stochastically defines a mapping of
strings over the input alphabet into the output
alphabet. The mapping is conditional on the L
previous input symbols.
In the case of sparse data, the probability
distribution is conditioned on only some of the
inputs. We use sparse Markov transducers to
model these type of distributions. A sparse
Markov transducer is a conditional probability
of the form:
p(yt xti on2xt2...(Ank Xtk (5)
where 0 represents a wild card symbol and
ti= t - E zi .1n3 - (i - 1). The goal of the
sparse Markov transducer estimation algorithm
is to estimate a conditional probability of this
form based upon a set of inputs and their corresponding outputs. However, the task is complicated due to the lack of knowledge a priori
of which inputs the probability distribution is
conditional on.
Intuitively, a fixed order Markov Chain of order L is equivalent to a n-gram with n = L.
In a variable order Markov Chain, the value of
n changes depending on the context. For example, some elements in the data may use a
bigram, while others may use a trigram. The
sparse Markov transducer uses a weighted sum
of n-grams for different values of n and these
weights depend on the context. In addition the
weighted sum is over not only n-grams, but also
n-grams with wild cards such as a trigram where
only the first and last element is conditioned on.
In this case we are looking at the input sequence of the current word, Wt, the previous
tag, Tt_1, and the next tag, Tt±i. The output is the set of all possible tags. The models
that are in the weighted sum are the trigram,
WtTt_iTt+1; the bigrams WtTt_i, WtTt+i and
Tt_iTt+i; and the unigrams Wt, Tt_1 and Tt-Fi.
The specific weights of each model depends on
the context or the actual values of Wt, Tt_1, and
Tt+i .
150
Sparse Markov transducers depend on a set of
prior probabilities that incorporate prior knowledge about the importance of various elements
in the input sequence. These prior probabilities
are set based on the problem. For this problem,
we use the priors to encode the information that
the current word, Wt, is very important in determining the part of speech.
Each model in the weighted sum uses a
pseudo-count predictor. This predictor computes the probability of an output (tag) by the
number of times that a specific output was seen
in a given context. In order to avoid probabilities of 0, we assume that we have seen each
output at least once in every context. In fact,
these predictors can be any probability distribution which can also depend on what works
best for the task.
3.4 Naive Bayes
The probability distribution for the tags was
also estimated using a straight forward naive
Bayes approach.
We are interested in the probability of a tag,
given the current word, the previous tag, and
the next tag, or the probability distribution
P(Tt I Wt, Tt_i, Tt+i) which using Bayes Rule is
equivalent to:
=
P(Wi,Ti-1,71+1)21)*P(T2)
P(Wi, T2+1)
If we make the Naive Bayes independence assumption and we assume that the denominator
is constant for all values this reduces to:
P(711147z, Ti+1) =
P(WitZ) * * P(Ti+ilTi) * P(Ti)
(7)
where C is a normalization constant in order to
have the probabilities sum to 1. Each of the values on the right side of the equation can easily
be computed over the data estimating a probability distribution.
3.5 Computing Probability
Distributions
Each probability distribution was trained over
each record giving a model over the entire data.
The probability model is then used to determine whether or not an element is an anomaly
by applying the test in equation (3). Typically this can be done in an efficient manner
because the approach does not require reestimating the model over the entire data set. If an
element is designated as an anomaly, we remove
it from the set of normal elements and efficiently
reestimate the probability distribution to obtain
more anomalous elements.
4 Results/Evaluation
The method was applied to the Penn Treebank corpus and a set of anomalies were generated. These anomalies were evaluated by human judges to determine if they are in fact tagging errors in the corpus. The human judges
were natural language processing researchers
(not the author) familiar with the Penn Treebank markings.
In the experiments involving the sparse
Markov transducers, after applying the method,
7055 anomalies were detected. In the experiments involving the naive Bayes learning
method, 6213 anomalies were detected.
Sample output from the system is shown in
figure 1. The error is shown in the context
marked with !!!. The likelihood of the tag is
also given which is extremely low for the errors.
The system also outputs a suggested tag and
its likelihood which is the tag with the highest
likelihood for that context. As we can see, these
errors are clearly annotation errors.
Since the anomalies detected from the two
probability modeling methods differed only
slightly, we performed human judge verification
of the errors over only the results of the sparse
Markov transducer experiments.
The anomalies were ordered based on their
likelihood. Using this ranking, the set of anomalies were broken up into sets of 1000 records. We
examined the first 4000 elements by randomly
selecting 100 elements out of each 1000.
Human judges were presented with the system output for four sets of 100 anomalies. The
judges were asked to choose among three options for each example:
1. Corpus Error - The tag in the corpus sentence is incorrect.
2. Unsure - The judge is unsure whether or
not the corpus tag is correct.

3. System Error - The tag in the corpus sentence is correct and the system incorrectly
marked it as an error.
The &quot;unsure&quot; choice was allowed because of the
inherent subtleties in differentiating between
types of tags such as &quot;VB vs. VBP&quot; or &quot;VBD
vs. VBN&quot;.
Over the 400 examples evaluated, 158 were
corpus errors, 202 were system errors and the
judges were unsure in 40 of the cases. The corpus error rate was computed by throwing out
the unsure cases and computing:
Corpus error rate = (8)
Corpus Errors
System Errors + Corpus Errors
The total corpus error rate over the 400 manually checked examples was was 44%. As can be
seen, many of the anomalies are in fact errors
in the corpus.
For each error, we asked the human judge to
determine if the correct tag is the systems suggested tag. Out of the total 158 corpus errors,
the systems correct tag would have corrected
the error in 145 cases.
Since the verified examples were random, we
can assume that 91% of corpus errors would be
automatically corrected if the system would replace the suspect tag with the suggested tag. Ignoring the &quot;unsure&quot; elements for the purposes
of this analysis, if we attempted to automatically correct the first 1000 examples where the
error rate was 69%, this method would have led
to a reduction of the total number of errors in
the corpus by 245.
5 Conclusion
This paper presents a fully automatic method
for detecting errors in corpora using anomaly
detection techniques. As shown, the anomalies
detected in the Penn Treebank corpus tend to
be tagging errors.
This method has some inherent limitations
because not all errors in the corpus would manifest themselves as anomalies. In infrequent contexts or ambiguous situations, the method may
not have enough information to detect an error.
In addition, if there are inconsistencies between
annotators, the method would not detect the
errors because the errors would be manifested
over a significant portion of the corpus.
Although this paper presents a fully automatic method for error detection in corpora, this method can also be used as a semiautomatic method for correcting errors. The
method can guide an annotator to the elements
which are most likely errors. The method can
greatly reduce the number of elements that an
annotator needs to examine.
Future work in this area involves modeling
the corpora with other probability distributions.

The method is very sensitive to the effectiveness of the probability model in modeling the
normal elements. Extensions to the probability distributions presented here such as adding
information about endings of words or using
more features could increase the accuracy of the
probability distribution and the overall performance of the anomaly detection system. Other
future work involves applying this method to
other marked corpora.

Anomaly detection is extensively used within the field of computer security specifically in intrusion detection (Denning, 1987). Typically anomaly detection methods are applied to detect attacks by comparing the activity during an attack to the activity under normal use (Lane and Brodley, 1997; Warrender et al., 1999). The method used in this paper is based on a method for anomaly detection which detects anomalies in noisy data (Eskin, 2000). The sparse Markov transducer probability modeling method is an extension of adaptive mixtures of probabilistic transducers (Singer, 1997; Pereira and Singer, 1999). Naive Bayes learning, which is used to estimate probabilities in this paper, is described in (Mitchell, 1997). 2 An

 markings of the corpus. To detect the anomalies, we first compute a probability distribution over the entire corpus. Then we apply a statistical test which identifies which elements are anomalies. In this case the anomalies are the elements with very low likelihood. These elements are marked as errors and are thrown out of the corpus. The model is recomputed on the remaining elements. At conclusion, we are left with two data sets: one the normal elements and the second the detected anomalous elements. We evaluate this method over the part of speech tagged portion of the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993). In one experiment, our method detected 1000 anomalies within a data set of 1.25 million tagged elements. Human judges evaluated the results of the application of this method and verified that 69% of identified anomalies are in fact tagging errors. In another experiment, our method detected 4000 anomalies of which 44% are tagging errors. 1.1 Related Work The tagged portion of the Penn Treebank has been extensively utilized for construction and evaluation of taggers. This includes transformation-based tagging (Brill, 1994; Brill and Wu, 1998). Weischedel et al. (1993) applied Markov Models to
