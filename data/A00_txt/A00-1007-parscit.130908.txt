Abstract
We report on a method for utilising corpora collected in natural settings. It is based on distilling
(re-writing) natural dialogues to elicit the type of
dialogue that would occur if one the dialogue participants was a computer instead of a human. The
method is a complement to other means such as Wizard of Oz-studies and un-distilled natural dialogues.
We present the distilling method and guidelines for
distillation. We also illustrate how the method affects a corpus of dialogues and discuss the pros and
cons of three approaches in different phases of dialogue systems development.
1 Introduction
It has been known for quite some time now, that
the language used when interacting with a computer is different from the one used in dialogues between
people, (c.f. Jonsson and Dahlback (1988)). Given
that we know that the language will be different,
but not how it will be different, we need to base
our development of natural language dialogue systems on a relevant set of dialogue corpora. It is our
belief that we need to clarify a number of different
issues regarding the collection and use of corpora in
the development of speech-only and multimodal dialogue systems. Exchanging experiences and developing guidelines in this area are as important as, and in
some sense a necessary pre-requisite to, the development of computational models of speech, language,
and dialogue/discourse. It is interesting to note the
difference in the state of art in the field of natural language dialogue systems with that of corpus
linguistics, where issues of the usefulness of different
samples, the necessary sampling size, representativeness in corpus design and other have been discussed
for quite some time (e.g. (Garside et al., 1997; Atkins
et al., 1992; Crowdy, 1993; Biber, 1993)). Also the
neighboring area of evaluation of NLP systems (for
an overview, see Sparck Jones and Galliers (1996))
seems to have advanced further.
Some work have been done in the area of natural language dialogue systems, e.g. on the design
of Wizard of Oz-studies (Dahlback et al., 1998),
on measures for inter-rater reliability (Carletta,
1996), on frameworks for evaluating spoken dialogue
agents (Walker et al., 1998) and on the use of different corpora in the development of a particular system (The Carnegie-Mellon Communicator, Eskenazi
et al. (1999)).
The question we are addressing in this paper is
how to collect and analyse relevant corpora. We begin by describing what we consider to be the main
advantages and disadvantages of the two currently
used methods; studies of human dialogues and Wizard of Oz-dialogues, especially focusing on the ecological validity of the methods. We then describe a
method called 'distilling dialogues', which can serve
as a supplement to the other two.
2 Natural and Wizard of
Oz-Dialogues
The advantage of using real dialogues between people is that they will illustrate which tasks and needs
that people actually bring to a particular service
provider. Thus, on the level of the users' general
goals, such dialogues have a high validity. But there
are two drawbacks here. First; it is not self-evident
that users will have the same task expectations from
a computer system as they have with a person. Second, the language used will differ from the language
used when interacting with a computer.
These two disadvantages have been the major
force behind the development of Wizard of Ozmethods. The advantage here is that the setting will
be human-computer interaction. But there are important disadvantages, too. First, on the practical
side, the task of setting up a high quality simulation
environment and training the operators ('wizards')
to use this is a resource consuming task (Dahlback et
al., 1998). Second, and probably even more important, is that we cannot then observe real users using
a system for real life tasks, where they bring their
own needs, motivations, resources, and constraints
to bear. To some extent this problem can be overcome using well-designed so called 'scenarios'. As
pointed out in Dahlback (1991), on many levels of
analysis the artificiality of the situation will not af
44
fect the language used. An example of this is the
pattern of pronoun-antecedent relations. But since
the tasks given to the users are often pre-described
by the researchers, this means that this is not a good
way of finding out which tasks the users actually
want to perform. Nor does it provide a clear enough
picture on how the users will act to find something
that satisfies their requirements. If e.g. the task is
one of finding a charter holiday trip or buying a TVset within a specified set of constraints (economical
and other), it is conceivable that people will stay
with the first item that matches the specification,
whereas in real life they would probably look for
alternatives. In our experience, this is primarily a
concern if the focus is on the users' goals and plans,
but is less a problem when the interest is on lowerlevel aspects, such as, syntax or patterns of pronounantecedent relationship (c.f. Dahlback (1991)).
To summarize; real life dialogues will provide a
reasonably correct picture of the way users' approach their tasks, and what tasks they bring to
the service provider, but the language used will not
give a good approximation of what the system under construction will need to handle. Wizard of Ozdialogues, on the other hand, will give a reasonable
approximation of some aspects of the language used,
but in an artificial context.
The usual approach has been to work in three
steps. First analyse real human dialogues, and based
on these, in the second phase, design one or more
Wizard of Oz-studies. The final step is to fine-tune
the system's performance on real users. A good example of this method is presented in Eskenazi et al.
(1999). But there are also possible problems with
this approach (though we are not claiming that this
was the case in their particular project). Eskenazi et
al. (1999) asked a human operator to act 'computerlike' in their Wizard of Oz-phase. The advantage
is of course that the human operator will be able
to perform all the tasks that is usually provided by
this service. The disadvantage is that it puts a heavy
burden on the human operator to act as a computer. Since we know that lay-persons' ideas of what
computers can and cannot do are in many respects
far removed from what is actually the case, we risk
introducing some systematic distortion here. And
since it is difficult to perform consistently in similar
situations, we also risk introducing non-systematic
distortion here, even in those cases when the 'wizard' is an NLP-professional.
Our suggestion is therefore to supplement the
above mentioned methods, and bridge the gap between them, by post-processing human dialogues to
give them a computer-like quality. The advantage,
compared to having people do the simulation on the
fly, is both that it can be done with more consistency, and also that it can be done by researchers
that actually know what human-computer natural
language dialogues can look like. A possible disadvantage with using both Wizard of Oz-and real
computer dialogues, is that users will quickly adapt
to what the system can provide them with, and will
therefore not try to use it for tasks they know it
cannot perform. Consequently, we will not get a full
picture of the different services they would like the
system to provide.
A disadvantage with this method is, of course,
that post-processing takes some time compared to
using the natural dialogues as they are. There is also a concern on the ecological validity of the results,
as discussed later.
3 Distilling dialogues
Distilling dialogues, i.e. re-writing human interactions in order to have them reflect what a humancomputer interaction could look like involves a number of considerations. The main issue is that in corpora of natural dialogues one of the interlocutors is
not a dialogue system. The system's task is instead
performed by a human and the problem is how to
anticipate the behaviour of a system that does not
exist based on the performance of an agent with different performance characteristics. One important
aspect is how to deal with human features that are
not part of what the system is supposed to be able
to handle, for instance if the user talks about things
outside of the domain, such as discussing an episode
of a recent TV show. It also involves issues on how
to handle situations where one of the interlocuters
discusses with someone else on a different topic, e.g.
discussing the up-coming Friday party with a friend
in the middle of an information providing dialogue
with a customer.
It is important for the distilling process to have at
least an outline of the dialogue system that is under
development: Will it for instance have the capacity
to recognise users' goals, even if not explicitly stated? Will it be able to reason about the discourse
domain? What services will it provide, and what
will be outside its capacity to handle?
In our case, we assume that the planned dialogue
system has the ability to reason on various aspects
of dialogue and properties of the application. In our
current work, and in the examples used for illustration in this paper, we assume a dialogue model that
can handle any relevant dialogue phenomenon and
also an interpreter and speech recogniser being able
to understand any user input that is relevant to the
task. There is is also a powerful domain reasoning module allowing for more or less any knowledge
reasoning on issues that can be accomplished within the domain (Flycht-Eriksson, 1999). Our current
system does, however, not have an explicit user task
model, as opposed to a system task model (Dahlback
45
and Jonsson, 1999), which is included, and thus, we
can not assume that the 'system' remembers utterances where the user explains its task. Furthermore,
as our aim is system development we will not consider interaction outside the systems capabilities as
relevant to include in the distilled dialogues.
The context of our work is the development a
multi-modal dialogue system. However, in our current work with distilling dialogues, the abilities of
a multi-modal system were not fully accounted for.
The reason for this is that the dialogues would be
significantly affected, e.g. a telephone conversation
where the user always likes to have the next connection, please will result in a table if multi-modal
output is possible and hence a fair amount of the dialogue is removed. We have therefore in this paper
analysed the corpus assuming a speech-only system,
since this is closer to the original telephone conversations, and hence needs fewer assumptions on system
performance when distilling the dialogues.
4 Distillation guidelines
Distilling dialogues requires guidelines for how to
handle various types of utterances. In this section
we will present our guidelines for distilling a corpus
of telephone conversations between a human information provider on local buses' to be used for developing a multimodal dialogue system (Qvarfordt and
Jonsson, 1998; Flycht-Eriksson and JOnsson, 1998;
Dahlback et al., 1999; Qvarfordt, 1998). Similar
guidelines are used within another project on developing Swedish Dialogue Systems where the domain
is travel bureau information.
We can distinguish three types of contributors:
'System' (i.e. a future systems) utterances, User utterances, and other types, such as moves by other
speakers, and noise.
4.1 Modifying system utterances
The problem of modifying 'system' utterances can
be divided into two parts: how to change and when
to change. They are in some respects intertwined,
but as the how-part affects the when-part more we
will take this as a starting point.
• The 'system' provides as much relevant information as possible at once. This depends on
the capabilities of the systems output modalities. If we have a screen or similar output
device we present as much as possible which
normally is all relevant information. If we, on
the other hand, only have spoken output the
amount of information that the hearer can interpret in one utterance must be considered when
1The bus time table dialogues are collected at
Linkoping University and are available (in Swedish) on
http://www.ida.liu.se/—arnjo/kfb/dialoger.html
distilling. The system might in such cases provide less information. The principle of providing all relevant information is based on the assumption that a computer system often has access to all relevant information when querying
the background system and can also present it
more conveniently, especially in a multimodal
system (Ahrenberg et al., 1996). A typical example is the dialogue fragment in figure 1. In
this fragment the system provides information
on what train to take and how to change to a
bus. The result of distilling this fragment provides the revised fragment of figure 2. As seen in
the fragment of figure 2 we also remove a number of utterances typical for human interaction,
as discussed below.
• System utterances are made more computer-like
and do not include irrelevant information. The
latter is seen in S9 in the dialogue in figure 3
where the provided information is not relevant.
It could also be possible to remove S5 and respond with S7 at once. This, however, depends
on if the information grounded in S5-U6 is needed for the 'system' in order to know the arrival
time or if that could be concluded from U4.
This in turn depends on the system's capabilities. If we assume that the dialogue system has
a model of user tasks, the information in 55-U6
could have been concluded from that. We will,
in this case, retain S5-U6 as we do not assume a
user task model (Dahlback and Jonsson, 1999)
and in order to stay as close to the original dialogue as possible.
The next problem concerns the case when 'system'
utterances are changed or removed.
• Dialogue contributions provided by something or
someone other than the user or the 'system' are
removed. These are regarded as not being part
of the interaction. This means that if someone interrupts the current interaction, say that
the telephone rings during a face-to-face interaction, the interrupting interaction is normally
removed from the corpus.
Furthermore, 'system' interruptions are removed. A human can very well interrupt another human interlocuter, but a computer system
will not do that.
However, this guideline could lead to problems,
for instance, when users follow up such interruptions. If no information is provided or the interrupted sequence does not affect the dialogue,
we have no problems removing the interruption.
The problem is what to do when information
from the 'system' is used in the continuing dialogue. For such cases we have no fixed strategy,

the dialogue needs to be rearranged depending
on how the information is to be used (c.f. the
discussion in the final section of this paper).
• 'System' utterances which are no longer valid
are removed. Typical examples of this are the
utterances S7, 59, S1 1 and S13 in the dialogue
fragment of figure 1.
• Remove sequences of utterances where the 'system' behaves in a way a computer would not do.
For instance jokes, irony, humor, commenting
on the other dialogue participant, or dropping
the telephone (or whatever is going on in S7
in figure 4). A common case of this is when
the 'system' is talking while looking for information, S5 in the dialogue fragment of figure 4
is an example of this. Related to this is when
the system provides its own comments. If we
can assume that it has such capabilities they
are included, otherwise we remove them.
• The system does not repeat information that has
already been provided unless explicitly asked to
do so. In human interaction it is not uncommon
to repeat what has been uttered for purposes
other than to provide grounding information or
feedback. This is for instance common during

search procedures as discussed above.
• The system does not ask for information it has
already achieved. For instance asking again if it
is on Sunday as in S9 in figure 1. This is not uncommon in human interaction and such utterances from the user are not removed. However,
we can assume that the dialogue system does
not forget what has been talked about before.
4.2 Modifying user utterances
The general rule is to change user utterances as little as possible. The reason for this is that we do not
want to develop systems where the user needs to
restrict his/her behaviour to the capabilities of the
dialogue system. However, there are certain changes
made to user utterances, in most cases as a consequence of changes of system utterances.
• Utterances that are no longer valid are removed.
The most common cases are utterances whose
request has already been answered, as seen in
the distilled dialogue in figure 2 of the dialogue
in figure 1.

U12: sixteen fifty five (.) aha
sexton ferntifem (.) jaha
S13: bus line four hundred thirty five
linje fyrahundra trettifem
Figure 5: Dialogue fragment from a natural bus
timetable interaction
• Utterances are removed where the user discuss
es things that are in the environment. For
instance commenting the 'systems' clothes or
hair. This also includes other types of communicative signals such as laughter based on things
outside the interaction, for instance, in the environment of the interlocuters.
• User utterances can also be added in order to
make the dialogue continue. In the dialogue in
figure 5 there is nothing in the dialogue explaining why the system utters S13. In such cases
we need to add a user utterance, e.g. Which
bus is that?. However, it might turn out that
there are cues, such as intonation, found when
listening to the tapes. If such detailed analyses
are carried out, we will, of course, not need to
add utterances. Furthermore, it is sometimes
the case that the telephone operator deliberately splits the information into chunks that can
be comprehended by the user, which then must
be considered in the distillation.
5 Applying the method
To illustrate the method we will in this section try to
characterise the results from our distillations. The
illustration is based on 39 distilled dialogues from
the previously mentioned corpus collected with a
telephone operator having information on local bus
time-tables and persons calling the information service.
The distillation took about three hours for all 39
dialogues, i.e. it is reasonably fast. The distilled
dialogues are on the average 27% shorter. However,
this varies between the dialogues, at most 73% was
removed but there were also seven dialogues that
were not changed at all.
At the most 34 utterances where removed from
one single dialogue and that was from a dialogue
with discussions on where to find a parking lot, i.e.
discussions outside the capabilities of the application. There was one more dialogue where more than
30 utterances were removed and that dialogue is a
typical example of dialogues where distillation actually is very useful and also indicates what is normally removed from the dialogues. This particular dialogue begins with the user asking for the telephone
number to 'the Lost property office' for a specific bus
operator. However, the operator starts a discussion
on what bus the traveller traveled on before providing the requested telephone number. The reason for
this discussion is probably that the operator knows
that different bus companies are utilised and would
like to make sure that the user really understands
his/her request. The interaction that follows can,
thus, in that respect be relevant, but for our purpose of developing systems based on an overall goal
of providing information, not to understand human
interaction, our dialogue system will not able to handle such phenomenon (Jonsson, 1996).
The dialogues can roughly be divided into five different categories based on the users task. The discussion in twenty five dialogues were on bus times
between various places, often one departure and one
arrival but five dialogues involved more places. In
five dialogues the discussion was one price and various types of discounts. Five users wanted to know
the telephone number to 'the Lost property office',
two discussed only bus stops and two discussed how
they could utilise their season ticket to travel outside the trafficking area of the bus company. It is
interesting to note that there is no correspondence
between the task being performed during the interaction and the amount of changes made to the dialogue. Thus, if we can assume that the amount of
distillation indicates something about a user's interaction style, other factors than the task are important when characterising user behaviour.
Looking at what is altered we find that the most
important distilling principle is that the 'system'
provides all relevant information at once, c.f. figures 1 and 2. This in turn removes utterances provided by both 'system' and user.
Most added utterances, both from the user and
the 'system', provide explicit requests for information that is later provided in the dialogue, e.g. utterance S3 in figure 6. We have added ten utterances
in all 39 dialogues, five 'system' utterances and five
user utterances. Note, however, that we utilised the
transcribed dialogues, without information on intonation. We would probably not have needed to add
this many utterances if we had utilised the tapes.
Our reason for not using information on intonation
is that we do not assume that our system's speech
recogniser can recognise intonation.
Finally, as discussed above, we did not utilise the
full potential of multi-modality when distilling the
dialogues. For instance, some dialogues could be
further distilled if we had assumed that the system
had presented a time-table. One reason for this is
that we wanted to capture as many interesting aspects intact as possible. The advantage is, thus, that
we have a better corpus for understanding human

computer interaction and can from that corpus do
a second distillation where we focus more on multimodal interaction.
6 Discussion
We have been presenting a method for distilling human dialogues to make them resemble human computer interaction, in order to utilise such dialogues
as a knowledge source when developing dialogue systems. Our own main purpose has been to use them
for developing multimodal systems, however, as discussed above, we have in this paper rather assumed
a speech-only system. But we believe that the basic
approach can be used also for multi-modal systems
and other kinds of natural language dialogue systems.
It is important to be aware of the limitations of
the method, and how 'realistic' the produced result
will be, compared to a dialogue with the final system. Since we are changing the dialogue moves, by
for instance providing all required information in one
move, or never asking to be reminded of what the user has previously requested, it is obvious that what
follows after the changed sequence would probably
be affected one way or another. A consequence of
this is that the resulting dialogue is less accurate as
a model of the entire dialogue. It is therefore not an
ideal candidate for trying out the systems over-all
performance during system development. But for
the smaller sub-segments or sub-dialogues, we believe that it creates a good approximation of what
will take place once the system is up and running.
Furthermore, we believe distilled dialogues in some
respects to be more realistic than Wizard of Ozdialogues collected with a wizard acting as a computer.
Another issue, that has been discussed previously
in the description of the method, is that the distilling
is made based on a particular view of what a dialogue
with a computer will look like. While not necessarily being a detailed and specific model, it is at least
an instance of a class of computer dialogue models.
One example of this is whether the system is meant
to acquire information on the user's underlying motivations or goals or not. In the examples presented,
we have not assumed such capabilities, but this assumption is not an absolute necessity. We believe,
however, that the distilling process should be based
on one such model, not the least to ensure a consistent treatment of similar recurring phenomena at
different places in the corpora.
The validity of the results based on analysing distilled dialogues depends partly on how the distillation has been carried out. Even when using natural
dialogues we can have situations where the interaction is somewhat mysterious, for instance, if some of
the dialogue participants behaves irrational such as
not providing feedback or being too elliptical. However, if careful considerations have been made to stay
as close to the original dialogues as possible, we believe that distilled dialogues will reflect what a human would consider to be a natural interaction.

We report on a method for utilising corpora collected in natural settings. It is based on distilling (re-writing) natural dialogues to elicit the type of dialogue that would occur if one the dialogue participants was a computer instead of a human. The method is a complement to other means such as Wizard of Oz-studies and un-distilled natural dialogues. We present the distilling method and guidelines for distillation. We also illustrate how the method affects a corpus of dialogues and discuss the pros and cons of three approaches in different phases of dialogue systems development.

t information. The latter is seen in S9 in the dialogue in figure 3 where the provided information is not relevant. It could also be possible to remove S5 and respond with S7 at once. This, however, depends on if the information grounded in S5-U6 is needed for the 'system' in order to know the arrival time or if that could be concluded from U4. This in turn depends on the system's capabilities. If we assume that the dialogue system has a model of user tasks, the information in 55-U6 could have been concluded from that. We will, in this case, retain S5-U6 as we do not assume a user task model (Dahlback and Jonsson, 1999) and in order to stay as close to the original dialogue as possible. The next problem concerns the case when 'system' utterances are changed or removed. • Dialogue contributions provided by something or someone other than the user or the 'system' are removed. These are regarded as not being part of the interaction. This means that if someone interrupts the current interaction, say that the telephone rings during a face-to-face interaction, the interrupting interaction is normally removed from the corpus. Furthermore, 'system' interruptions are removed. A human can very well interrupt another h

 not self-evident that users will have the same task expectations from a computer system as they have with a person. Second, the language used will differ from the language used when interacting with a computer. These two disadvantages have been the major force behind the development of Wizard of Ozmethods. The advantage here is that the setting will be human-computer interaction. But there are important disadvantages, too. First, on the practical side, the task of setting up a high quality simulation environment and training the operators ('wizards') to use this is a resource consuming task (Dahlback et al., 1998). Second, and probably even more important, is that we cannot then observe real users using a system for real life tasks, where they bring their own needs, motivations, resources, and constraints to bear. To some extent this problem can be overcome using well-designed so called 'scenarios'.

 in this paper analysed the corpus assuming a speech-only system, since this is closer to the original telephone conversations, and hence needs fewer assumptions on system performance when distilling the dialogues. 4 Distillation guidelines Distilling dialogues requires guidelines for how to handle various types of utterances. In this section we will present our guidelines for distilling a corpus of telephone conversations between a human information provider on local buses' to be used for developing a multimodal dialogue system (Qvarfordt and Jonsson, 1998; Flycht-Eriksson and JOnsson, 1998; Dahlback et al., 1999; Qvarfordt, 1998). Similar guidelines are used within another project on developing Swedish Dialogue Systems where the domain is travel bureau information. We can distinguish three types of contributors: 'System' (i.e. a future systems) utterances, User utterances, and other types, such as moves by other speakers, and noise. 4.1 Modifying system utterances The problem of modifying 'system' utterances can be divided into two parts: how to change and when to change. They are in some respects intertwined, but as the how-part affects the when-part more we will take this as a starting point. • The

Nor does it provide a clear enough picture on how the users will act to find something that satisfies their requirements. If e.g. the task is one of finding a charter holiday trip or buying a TVset within a specified set of constraints (economica

We begin by describing what we consider to be the main advantages and disadvantages of the two currently used methods; studies of human dialogues and Wizard of Oz-dialogues, especially focusing on the ecological validity of the methods. We then describe a method called 'distilling dialogues', which can serve as a supplement to the other two. 2 Natural and Wizard of Oz-Dialogues The advantage of using real dialogues between people is that they will illustrate which tasks and needs that people actuall
nd what tasks they bring to the service provider, but the language used will not give a good approximation of what the system under construction will need to handle. Wizard of Ozdialogues, on the other hand, will give a reasonable approximation of some aspects of the language used, but in an artificial context. The usual approach has been to work in three steps. First analyse real human dialogues, and based on these, in the second phase, design one or more Wizard of Oz-studies. The final step is to fine-tune the system's performance on real users. A good example of this method is presented in Eskenazi et al. (1999). But there are also possible problems with this approach (though we are not claiming that this was the case in their particular project). Eskenazi et al. (1999) asked a human operator to act 'computerlike' in their Wizard of Oz-phase. The advantage is of course that the human operator will be able to perform all the tasks that is usually provided by this service. The disadvantage is that it puts a heavy burden on the human operator to act as a computer. Since we know that lay-persons' ideas of what computers can and cannot do are in many respects far removed from what is actually the case, we

e its capacity to handle? In our case, we assume that the planned dialogue system has the ability to reason on various aspects of dialogue and properties of the application. In our current work, and in the examples used for illustration in this paper, we assume a dialogue model that can handle any relevant dialogue phenomenon and also an interpreter and speech recogniser being able to understand any user input that is relevant to the task. There is is also a powerful domain reasoning module allowing for more or less any knowledge reasoning on issues that can be accomplished within the domain (Flycht-Eriksson, 1999). Our current system does, however, not have an explicit user task model, as opposed to a system task model (Dahlback 45 and Jonsson, 1999), which is included, and thus, we can not assume that the 'system' remembers utterances where the user explains its task. Furthermore, as our aim is system development we will not consider interaction outside the systems capabilities as relevant to include in the distilled dialogues. The context of our work is the development a multi-modal dialogue system. However, in our current work with distilling dialogues, the abilities of a multi-modal system were not

We present the distilling method and guidelines for distillation. We also illustrate how the method affects a corpus of dialogues and discuss the pros and cons of three approaches in different phases of dialogue systems development. 1 Introduction It has been known for quite some time now, that the language used when interacting with a computer is different from the one used in dialogues between people, (c.f. Jonsson and Dahlback (1988)). Given that we know that the language will be different, but not how it will be different, we need to base our development of natural language dialogue systems on a relevant set of dialogue corpora. It is our belief that we need to clarify a number of different issues regarding the collection and use of corpora in the development of speech-only and multimodal dialogue systems. Exchanging experiences and developing guidelines in this area are as important as, and in some sense a necessary pre-requisite to, the development of computational models of speech, language, and dialogue/discourse.

 specific bus operator. However, the operator starts a discussion on what bus the traveller traveled on before providing the requested telephone number. The reason for this discussion is probably that the operator knows that different bus companies are utilised and would like to make sure that the user really understands his/her request. The interaction that follows can, thus, in that respect be relevant, but for our purpose of developing systems based on an overall goal of providing information, not to understand human interaction, our dialogue system will not able to handle such phenomenon (Jonsson, 1996). The dialogues can roughly be divided into five different categories based on the users task. The discussion in twenty five dialogues were on bus times between various places, often one departure and one arrival but five dialogues involved more places. In five dialogues the discussion was one price and various types of discounts. Five users wanted to know the telephone number to 'the Lost property office', two discussed only bus stops and two discussed how they could utilise their season ticket to travel outside the trafficking area of the bus company. It is interesting to note that there is
