Abstract
Part of Speech tagging for English seems to have
reached the the human levels of error, but full morphological tagging for inflectionally rich languages,
such as Romanian, Czech, or Hungarian, is still an
open problem, and the results are far from being
satisfactory. This paper presents results obtained
by using a universalized exponential feature-based
model for five such languages. It focuses on the data
sparseness issue, which is especially severe for such
languages (the more so that there are no extensive
annotated data for those languages). In conclusion,
we argue strongly that the use of an independent
morphological dictionary is the preferred choice to
more annotated data under such circumstances.
1 Full Morphological Tagging
English Part of Speech (POS) tagging has been
widely described in the recent past, starting with
the (Church, 1988) paper, followed by numerous
others using various methods: neural networks (Julian Benello and Anderson, 1989), HMM tagging
(Merialdo, 1992), decision trees (Schmid, 1994),
transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill,
1995), and maximum entropy (Ratnaparkhi, 1996),
to select just a few. However different the methods
were, English dominated in these tests.
Unfortunately, English is a morphologically &quot;impoverished&quot; language: there are no complicated
agreement relations, word order variation is minimal, and the morphological categories are either extremely simple (-s for plural of nouns, for example),
or (almost) nonexistent (cases expressed by inflection, for example) - with not too many exceptions
and irregularities. Therefore the number of tags selected for an English tagset is not that large (40-75
in the typical case). Also, the average ambiguity
is low (2.32 tags per token on the manually tagged
• The work described herein has been started and largely

of the Czech Republic and partially also under the grant
405/96/K214 of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.
Wall Street Journal part in the Penn Treebank, for
example).
Highly inflective and agglutinative languages are
different. Obviously we can limit the number of tags
to the major part-of-speech classes, plus some (like
the Xerox Language Tools (Chanod, 1997) for such
languages do), and in fact achieve similar performance, but that limits the usefulness of the results
thus obtained for further analysis. These languages,
obviously, do not use the rich inflection just for the
amusement (or embarrassment) of their speakers (or
NLP researchers): the inflectional categories carry
important information which ought to be known at
a later time (e.g., during parsing). Thus one wants
not only to tell apart verbs from nouns, but also
nominative from genitive, masculine animate from
inanimate, singular from plural - all of them being
often ambiguous one way or the other.
The average tagset, as found even in a moderate
corpus, contains between 500 and 1,000 distinct tags
- whereas the size of the set of possible and plausible
tags can reach 3,000 to 5,000. Obviously, any of the
statistical methods used for English (even if fully
supervised) clash with (or, fall through) the data
sparseness problem (see below Table 1 for details).
There have been attempts to solve this problem
for some of the highly inflectional European languages ((Daelemans et al., 1996), (Erjavec et al.,
1999), (Tufis, 1999), and also our own in (Hajit
and Hladka., 1997), (Haji t and Hladka, 1998), see
also below), but so far no method nor a tagger has
been evaluated against a larger number of those languages in a similar setting, to allow for a side-byside comparison of the difficulty (or ease) of full
morphological tagging of those languages. Thanks
to the Multext-East project (Veronis, 1996a), there
are now five annotated corpora available (which are
manually fully morphologically tagged) to perform
such experiments.
2 The Languages Used and The
Training Data
We use the Multext-East-annotated version of the
Orwell's 1984 novel in Czech, Estonian, Hungarian,
94
Romanian and Slovene'. The annotation uses a single SGML-based formal scheme, and even common
guidelines for tagset design and annotation, nevertheless the tagsets differ substantially since the
languages differ as well: Romanian is a French-like
romance language, Hungarian is agglutinative, and
the other languages are more or less inflectionaltype languages2. The annotated data contains about
100k tokens (including punctuation) for each language; out of those, the first 20k tokens has been
used for testing, the rest for training. We have also
extended the tag identifiers by appending a string
of hyphens ('-&apos;) to suit the exponential tagger which
expects the tags to be of equal length; the mapping
was 1:1 for all tags in all languages, since the &quot;long&quot;
tags are in fact the Multext-East standard.
From the tagging point of view, the language characteristics displayed in Table 1 are the most relevant3.
3 The Methodology
The main tagger used for the comparison experiment
is the probabilistic exponential-model-based, errordriven learner we described in detail in (Hajie and
Hladka, 1998). Modifications had to be made, however, to make it more universal across languages.
3.1 Structure of the Model
The model described in (Hajie and Hladka, 1998)
is a general exponential (specifically, a log-linear)
model (such as the one used for Maximum Entropybased models):
exp(E7_1 (y, x))
PAc(Yix) = (1)
-Z(x)
where fi(y, x) is a binary-valued feature of the
event value being predicted and its context, Ai is
a weight of the feature f, and Z(x) is the natural
normalization factor. This model is then essentially
reduced to Naive Bayes by the approximation of the
1There are more languages involved in the Multext-East
project, but only these five languages have been really carefully tagged; English is unfortunately tagged using Eric Brill's
tagger trained in unsupervised mode, leaving multiple output
at almost every ambiguous token, and Bulgarian is totally
unusable since it has been tagged automatically with only
a baseline tagger. The English results reported below thus
come from the Penn Treebank data, from which we have used
roughly 100,000 words to match the training data sizes for the
remaining languages. For Czech, Hungarian, and Slovene we
use later versions of the annotated data (than those found on
the Multext-East CD) which we obtained directly from the
authors of the annotations after the Multext-CD had been
published, since the new data contain rather substantial improvements over the originally published data.
2For detailed account of the lexical characteristics of these
languages, see (Veronis, 1996b).
3We have included English here for comparison purposes,
since these characteristics are independent of the annotation.
Ai parameters, which is done because there are millions of possible features in the pool and thus the full
entropy maximization is prohibitively expensive, if
we want to select a small number of features instead
of keeping them all.
The tags are predicted separately for each morphological category (such as POS, NUMBER,
CASE, DEGREE OF COMPARISON, etc.). The
model makes an extensive use of so-called &quot;ambiguity classes&quot; (ACs). An ambiguity class is a set of
values (such as genitive and accusative) of a single
category (such as CASE) which arises for some word
forms as a result of morphological analysis. For unambiguous word forms (unambiguous from the point
of view of a certain category), the ambiguity class set
contains only a single value; for ambiguous forms,
there are 2 or more values in the AC. For example,
let's suppose we use part-of-speech (POS), number
and tense as morphological categories for English;
then the word form &quot;borrowed&quot; is 2-way ambiguous
in POS ({V,1} for verb and adjective, respectively),
unambiguous in number (linguistic arguments apart,
number is typically regarded &quot;not applicable&quot; to adjectives as well as to almost all forms of verbs in
English), and 3-way ambiguous in tense ({P ,N, -}
for past tense, past participle, and &quot;not applicable&quot;
in the adjective form).
The predictions of the models are always conditioned on the ambiguity class of the category (POS,
NUMBER, ...) in question. In other words, there is
a separate model for each category and an ambiguity class from that category. Naturally, there is no
model for unambiguous ACs classes. However, even
though the ambiguity classes bring very valuable information about the word form being tagged and a
reliable information about the context (since they
are fixed during tagging), using ACs causes also an
unwelcome effect of partitioning the already scarce
data and also effectively ignores statistics of the unambiguous cases.
The context of features uses the neighboring words
(original word forms) and ambiguity classes on subtags, where their relative position in text might be
either fixed (0, -1, +1) or &quot;variable&quot; using a value of
the POS subtag as the &quot;stop here&quot; criterion, up to
4 text positions (words) apart.
3.2 General Subtag Features
The original model uses the ambiguity classes not
only for conditioning on context in features, but also
for the individual models based on category and an
AC.
More general features have been introduced,
which do not depend on the ambiguity class of the
subtag being predicted any more. This allows to
learn also from unambiguous tokens. However, the
training time is increased dramatically by doing so
since all events in the training data have to be taken

into consideration, as opposed to the case of training
the small AC-based model, when only those training
events which contain the particular AC are used.
3.3 Variable Distance Condition
The &quot;stop&quot; criterion for finding the appropriate relative position was originally based on hard coded
choices suitable for the Czech language only, and of
course it depended on the tagset as well. This dependency has been removed by selecting the appropriate
conditions automatically when building the pool of
possible features at the initialization phase5 (using
the relative frequency of the POS ambiguity classes,
and a threshold to cut off less frequent categories to
limit the size of the feature pool).
3.4 Weight Variation
Even though the full computation of the appropriate
feature weight is still prohibitive (the more so when
the general features are added), the learner is now
allowed to vary the weights (in several discrete steps)
during feature selection, as a (somewhat crude) attempt to depart from the Naive Bayes simplification
to the approximation of the &quot;correct&quot; Maximum Entropy estimation.
3.5 Handling Unknown Words
In order to compare the effects of (not) using an independent dictionary, we have added an unknown
word handling module to the code.6 It extracts
the prefix and suffix frequency information (and the
combination thereof) from the training data. Then,
for each of the combinations, it selects the most frequent set of tags seen in the training data and stores
it for later use. When tagging, the data is first piped
through a &quot;guesser&quot; which assigns to the unknown
words such a set of possible tags which is stored with
the longest matching prefix/suffix combination.
5 Also, the use of variable-distance context may be switched
off entirely.
60riginally, the code relied exclusively on the use of such
an independent dictionary. Since the coverage of the Czech
dictionary we have used is extensive, we have been simply
ignoring the unknown word problem altogether in the past.
4 The Results
4.1 Reporting Error Rate: Words vs.
Tokens
Since &quot;best-only&quot; tagging has been carried out, the
error rate (i.e, 100 - accuracy in %) measure has
been used throughout as the only evaluation criterion. However, since some results reported previously were apparently obtained using only the &quot;real&quot;
words as the total for accuracy evaluation, whereas
in other experiments every token counts (including
punctuation', for example), we have computed both
and report them separately9.
4.2 Availability of Dictionary Information
We use two methods to obtain the set of possible
tags for any given word form (i.e., to analyze it morphologically). Both methods include handling unknown words. First, we use only information which
may be obtained automatically from the manually
annotated corpus (we call this method automatic).
This is the way the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) runs if one uses the binary version
from the website (see the comparison in Section 5).
However, it is not unreasonable to assume that a
larger independent dictionary exists which can help
to obtain a list of possible tags for each word form
in test data. This is what we have at our disposal
for the languages in question, since the development
of such a dictionary was part of the Multext-East
project. We can thus assume a dictionary info is
available for unknown words in the test data, i.e.,
even though there is no statistics available for them
(since they did not appear in the training data), all
possible tags for (almost9) every test token are available. This method is referred to as independent in
the following text.
We have also used a third method of obtaining a dictionary information (called mixed), namely,
by using only the words from the training data,
7And sometimes a separate token for sentence boundary
sTable 1 has been computed using all tokens. In fact, the
languages differ significantly in the proportion of punctuation:
from about 18% (English) to 30% (Estonian).
9Depending on the quality of the independent dictionary.
Of course, the tagsets must match, which could be a problem
per se. Here it is simple, since the dictionaries have been
developed using the same tagsets as the tagged data.
96
but complementing the information about them obtained from the training data by including all other
possible tags for such words. Therefore the net result
is that during testing, we have only training words
at our disposal, but with a complete dictionary information (as if coming from a full morphological
dictionary)1°.
The results on the full training data set are summarized in Table 2.
The baseline error rate is computed as follows.
First of all, we use the independent dictionary for
obtaining the possible tags for each word. Then we
extract only the lexical information from the current
position&quot; and counts used for smoothing (which is
based on the ambiguity classes only and it does not
use lexical information). The system is then trained
normally, which means it uses the lexical information
only if the AC-based smoothing12 alone does not
work. This baseline method is thus very close to the
usual baseline method of using simple conditional
distribution of tags given words.
The message of Table 2 seems to be obvious; but
before we jump to conclusions, let's present another
set of experiments.
In view of the recent interest in dealing with
&quot;small languages&quot;, and with regard to the questions
of cost-effectiveness of using &quot;human&quot; resources (i.e.
annotation vs. rule-writing vs. tools development
etc.), we have also performed experiments with reduced training data size (but with an enriched feature pool — by lowering thresholds, adding more of
the &quot;general features&quot; as described above, etc. — as
allowed by reasonable time/space constraints).13
These results are summarized in Table 3 (using
only the dictionary derived from the training data),
Table 4 (using words from training data with morphological information complemented from a dictionary) and Table 5 (using the &quot;independent&quot; dictionary). In all cases, we again count only true words
(no punctuation). Accordingly, the major POS error rate is reported, too (12 POS tags to be distinguished only: Noun, Verb, Adjective, ...; see Tables 6, 7, and 8).
&quot;This arrangement removes the &quot;closed vocabulary&quot; phenomenon from the test data, since for the Multext-East data,
we did not have a truly independent vocabulary available.
&quot;Words from the training data which are not singletons
(freq > 1) are used. Surprisingly enough, it would not hurt
to use them too. We believe it is due to the smoothing method
used. Even though this is valid only for the baseline experiment, we have observed in general that this form of exponential model (with error-driven training, that is) is remarkably
resistant to overtraining.
12using ACs linearly interpolated with global unigram subtag distribution and finally the uniform distribution.
&quot;By reasonable we mean less than a day of CPU for training.

4.3 Tagger Comparison
The work (Erjavec et al., 1999) consistently compares several taggers (HMM, Brill's Transformationbased Tagger, Ratnaparkhi's Maximum Entropy
tagger, and the Daelemans et al.'s Memory-based
Tagger) on Slovene. We have chosen the Maximum
Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for a comparison with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by
a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene
as reported there (86.360% on all tokens) of taggers available to us (MBT, the best overall, was not
freely available to us at the time of writing). We
have trained and tested the Maximum Entropy Tagger on exactly the same data, using the off-the-shelf
(java binary only) version.
The results are compared in Table 9.
Since we want to show how a tagger accuracy is
influenced by the amount of training data available,
we have run a series of experiments comparing the
results of the exponential tagger to the maximum
entropy tagger when there is only a limited amount
of data available. The results are summarized in
Table 10. Since the public version of the MaxEnt
tagger cannot be modified to take advantage of neither the mixed nor the independent dictionary, we
have compared it only to the automatic dictionary
version of the exponential tagger. To save space,
the results are tabulated only for the training data
sizes of 2000, 5000 and 20000 words. Again, only
the &quot;true&quot; word error rate is reported.
As the tables show, for the languages we tested,
the exponential, feature-based tagger we adapted
from (Haji and Hladka, 1998) achieves similar results as the Maximum Entropy tagger14 15. (using
exactly the same (full) training data; the &quot;score&quot;
is 3:3, with the MaxEnt tagger being substantially
better on English; probably the development lan
&quot;Otherwise the acknowledged leader in English tagging
15The only substantial difference we noticed was in tagging
speed. The runtime speed of the MaxEnt tagger is lower, only
about 10 words per second vs. almost 500 words per second;
it should be noted however that we are comparing MaxEnt's
java bytecode and C.

guage bias shows here16). However, when the training data size goes down, the advantage of predicting
the single morphological categories separately favors
the exponential tagger (with the notable and substantial exception of English). The less data, the
larger the difference (Tab 10).
160n the other hand, the Exponential tagger has been developed on Czech originally and it lost on this language. It
should be noted that the original version of the exponential tagger did contain more Czech-specific features, and thus
might in fact do better.
The resulting accuracy (of both taggers) is still
unsatisfactory not only from the point of view of
results obtained on English, but also from the practical point of view: approx. 85% accuracy (Czech,
Slovene) typically means that about five out of six
10-word sentences contain at least one error in it.
That is bad news e.g. for parsing projects involving
tagging as a preliminary step.

5 Conclusions
5.1 The Differences Among Languages
The following discussion abstracts from the tagset
design, relying on the fact that the Multext-East
project has been driven by common tagset guidelines
to an unprecedented extent, given the very different
languages involved. At the same time, we acknowledge that even so, their design for the individual
languages might have influenced the results. Also,
the quality of the annotation is an important factor;
we believe though that the later data we obtained
for the experiments described here are within the
range of usual human error and do not suffer from
negligence17.
First of all, it is clear that these languages differ
substantially just by looking at the simple training
17Specifically, we are sure that the post-release Czech,
Slovene and Hungarian data we are using are without annotation defects beyond the usual occasional annotation error,
as they have been double checked, and we also believe that
the other two languages are reasonably clean. Bulgarian, although present on the CD, is unfortunately unusable since it
has not been manually annotated; for English, see above.
data statistics, where the number of unique tags seen
in a relatively small collection of about 100k tokens is
high - from 401 (Hungarian) to 1033 (Slovene); compare that to English with only 139 tags. However, it
is interesting to see that the average per-token ambiguity is much more narrowly distributed, and in fact
English ranks 3rd (after Hungarian and Slovene),
Czech being the last with almost every other token
ambiguous on average. This ambiguity does not correspond with the results obtained: Slovene, being
the second least ambiguous, is the second most difficult to tag. Only Czech behaves consistently by
tailing the pack in both cases.
5.2 Comparison to Previous Results
Any comparison is necessarily difficult due to different evaluation methodologies, even within the &quot;bestonly&quot;, accuracy-based reporting. Nevertheless, we
will try.
For Romanian, Tufis in his recent work (Tufis,
1999) reports 98.5% accuracy (i.e. 1.5% error rate)
on Romanian, using the classifier combination approach advocated by e.g. (Brill and Wu, 1998). His

results are well above the 3.29% error rate achieved
here (with even a larger tagset of 1391 vs. 486 here),
but the paper does not say how this number has been
computed (training data size, the all-token/wordsonly question) thus making any conclusions difficult
to make. He also argues that his method is language
independent but no results are mentioned for other
languages.
For Czech, previous work achieved similar results
(6.20% on newspaper text using the all-tokens-based
error rate computation, on 160,000 training tokens;
vs. 7.04% here on approx. half that amount of training data; same handling of unknown words). This is
in line with the expectations, since the same methodology (tagging as well as evaluation) has been used,
except the features used in that work were specifically tuned to Czech.
The most detailed account of Slovene (Erjavec et
al., 1999) reports various results, which might not
be directly comparable because it is unclear whether
they use the all-tokens-based or words-only computation of the error rate. They report 6.421% error
rate on the full tagset on known words, and 13.583%
on all words (tokens?) including unknown words
(the exponential tagger we used achieved 13.82% on
all tokens, 16.26% on words only). They use almost
the same data (Orwell's 1984, but leaving out the
Appendices)18. They also report that the original
Czech-specific exponential tagger used as a basis for
the work reported here achieved 7.28% error rate on
Slovene on full tags on the same data, which means
that by the changes to the exponential tagger aimed
at its language independence we introduced in Section 3, we have not achieved any improvement (on
Slovene) of the exp. tagger (the error rate stayed at
7.26% - using all-tokens-based evaluation numbers,
dictionary available; but the data was not exactly
the same, presumably).
5.3 Dictionary vs. Training Data
This is, according to our opinion, the most interesting result of the experiments described so far. As
18Their tag count is lower (1021) than here (1033), but
that's not really relevant. They do not report the average
ambiguity or a similar measure.
already Table 2 clearly suggests, even the baseline
tagging results obtained with the help of an independent dictionary are comparable (if not better) than
the fully-trained tagger on 100k words, but without
the dictionary information. The situation is even
clearer when comparing the POS-only results: here
the &quot;independent&quot; dictionary results are better by
far, with almost no training data needed.
Looking at the characteristics of the languages, it
is apparent that the inflections cause the problem:
the coverage of a previously unseen text is inferior to
the usual coverage of English or another analytical
language. Therefore, unless we can come up with
a really clever way of learning rules for dealing with
previously unseen words, it is clearly strongly preferable to work on a morphological dictionary'9, rather
than to try to annotate more data.
6 Future Work
We would like to compare more taggers using still
other methodologies, especially the MBT tagger,
which achieved the best results on Slovene but which
was not available to us at the time of writing this
paper. Obviously, we would also like to use the classifier combination method on them, to confirm the
really surprisingly good results on Romanian and
test it on the other languages as well.
We would also like to enrich the best taggers available today (such as the Maximum Entropy tagger)
by using the dictionary information available and
compare the results with the exponential featurebased tagger we have been using in the experiments
here.
For Czech and Slovene, the results are still far below what one would like to see (in absolute terms). It
seems that the key lies in the initial feature set definition - including statistical tagset clustering, which
might potentially lead to more reliable estimates of
certain parameters while using still the same size of
training data.
&quot;Not necessarily manually - apparently, even a partially
supervised method would be of tremendous help.

Morphological Tagging: Data vs. Dictionaries

Part of Speech tagging for English seems to have reached the the human levels of error, but full morphological tagging for inflectionally rich languages, such as Romanian, Czech, or Hungarian, is still an open problem, and the results are far from being satisfactory. This paper presents results obtained by using a universalized exponential feature-based model for five such languages. It focuses on the data sparseness issue, which is especially severe for such languages (the more so that there are no extensive annotated data for those languages). In conclusion, we argue strongly that the use of an independent morphological dictionary is the preferred choice to more annotated data under such circumstances. 1 Full Morphological Tagging English Part of Speech (POS) tagging has been widely described in the recent past, starting with the (Church, 1988) paper, followed by numerous others using various methods: neural networks (Julian Benello and Anderson, 1989), HMM tagging (Merialdo, 1992), decision trees (Schmid, 1994), transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), and maximum entropy (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), to select just a few. However different the methods were, English dominated in these tests. Unfortunately, English is a morphologically &quot;impoverished&quot; language: there are no complicated agreement relations, word order variation is minimal, and the morphological categories are either exsimple plural of nouns, for example), or (almost) nonexistent (cases expressed by inflection, for example) with not too many exceptions and irregularities. Therefore the number of tags selected for an English tagset is not that large (40-75 in the typical case). Also, the average ambiguity is low (2.32 tags per token on the manually tagged • The work described herein has been started and largely done within author's home institution, the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University, Prague, CZ, within the project VS96151 of the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic and partially also under the grant 405/96/K214 of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic. Wall Street Journal part in the Penn Treebank, for example). Highly inflective and agglutinative languages are different. Obviously we can limit the number of tags to the major part-of-speech classes, plus some (like the Xerox Language Tools (Chanod, 1997) for such languages do), and in fact achieve similar performance, but that limits the usefulness of the results thus obtained for further analysis. These languages, obviously, do not use the rich inflection just for the amusement (or embarrassment) of their speakers (or NLP researchers): the inflectional categories carry important information which ought to be known at a later time (e.g., during parsing). Thus one wants not only to tell apart verbs from nouns, but also nominative from genitive, masculine animate from inanimate, singular from plural all of them being often ambiguous one way or the other. The average tagset, as found even in a moderate contains 500 and 1,000 distinct tags whereas the size of the set of possible and plausible tags can reach 3,000 to 5,000. Obviously, any of the statistical methods used for English (even if fully supervised) clash with (or, fall through) the data sparseness problem (see below Table 1 for details). There have been attempts to solve this problem for some of the highly inflectional European languages ((Daelemans et al., 1996), (Erjavec et al., 1999), (Tufis, 1999), and also our own in (Hajit and Hladka., 1997), (Haji t and Hladka, 1998), see also below), but so far no method nor a tagger has been evaluated against a larger number of those languages in a similar setting, to allow for a side-byside comparison of the difficulty (or ease) of full morphological tagging of those languages. Thanks to the Multext-East project (Veronis, 1996a), there are now five annotated corpora available (which are manually fully morphologically tagged) to perform such experiments. 2 The Languages Used and The Training Data We use the Multext-East-annotated version of the Orwell's 1984 novel in Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, 94 Romanian and Slovene'. The annotation uses a single SGML-based formal scheme, and even common guidelines for tagset design and annotation, nevertheless the tagsets differ substantially since the languages differ as well: Romanian is a French-like romance language, Hungarian is agglutinative, and the other languages are more or less inflectional- The annotated data contains about 100k tokens (including punctuation) for each language; out of those, the first 20k tokens has been used for testing, the rest for training. We have also extended the tag identifiers by appending a string of hyphens ('-&apos;) to suit the exponential tagger which expects the tags to be of equal length; the mapping was 1:1 for all tags in all languages, since the &quot;long&quot; tags are in fact the Multext-East standard. From the tagging point of view, the language characteristics displayed in Table 1 are the most rele- 3 The Methodology The main tagger used for the comparison experiment is the probabilistic exponential-model-based, errordriven learner we described in detail in (Hajie and Hladka, 1998). Modifications had to be made, however, to make it more universal across languages. 3.1 Structure of the Model The model described in (Hajie and Hladka, 1998) is a general exponential (specifically, a log-linear) model (such as the one used for Maximum Entropybased models): (y, (1) fi(y, a binary-valued the value being predicted and its context, is weight of the feature and the natural normalization factor. This model is then essentially reduced to Naive Bayes by the approximation of the are more languages involved in the Multext-East project, but only these five languages have been really carefully tagged; English is unfortunately tagged using Eric Brill's tagger trained in unsupervised mode, leaving multiple output at almost every ambiguous token, and Bulgarian is totally unusable since it has been tagged automatically with only a baseline tagger. The English results reported below thus come from the Penn Treebank data, from which we have used roughly 100,000 words to match the training data sizes for the remaining languages. For Czech, Hungarian, and Slovene we versions of the annotated data (than those found on the Multext-East CD) which we obtained directly from the authors of the annotations after the Multext-CD had been published, since the new data contain rather substantial improvements over the originally published data. detailed account of the lexical characteristics of these languages, see (Veronis, 1996b). have included English here for comparison purposes, these independent of the annotation. parameters, which is done because there are millions of possible features in the pool and thus the full entropy maximization is prohibitively expensive, if we want to select a small number of features instead of keeping them all. The tags are predicted separately for each morphological category (such as POS, NUMBER, CASE, DEGREE OF COMPARISON, etc.). The model makes an extensive use of so-called &quot;ambiguity classes&quot; (ACs). An ambiguity class is a set of values (such as genitive and accusative) of a single category (such as CASE) which arises for some word forms as a result of morphological analysis. For unambiguous word forms (unambiguous from the point of view of a certain category), the ambiguity class set contains only a single value; for ambiguous forms, there are 2 or more values in the AC. For example, let's suppose we use part-of-speech (POS), number and tense as morphological categories for English; the word form 2-way ambiguous in POS ({V,1} for verb and adjective, respectively), unambiguous in number (linguistic arguments apart, number is typically regarded &quot;not applicable&quot; to adjectives as well as to almost all forms of verbs in and 3-way ambiguous in tense ({P for past tense, past participle, and &quot;not applicable&quot; in the adjective form). The predictions of the models are always conditioned on the ambiguity class of the category (POS, NUMBER, ...) in question. In other words, there is separate model for each category ambiguity class from that category. Naturally, there is no model for unambiguous ACs classes. However, even though the ambiguity classes bring very valuable information about the word form being tagged and a reliable information about the context (since they are fixed during tagging), using ACs causes also an unwelcome effect of partitioning the already scarce data and also effectively ignores statistics of the unambiguous cases. The context of features uses the neighboring words (original word forms) and ambiguity classes on subtags, where their relative position in text might be either fixed (0, -1, +1) or &quot;variable&quot; using a value of the POS subtag as the &quot;stop here&quot; criterion, up to 4 text positions (words) apart. 3.2 General Subtag Features The original model uses the ambiguity classes not only for conditioning on context in features, but also the individual models based on category AC. More general features have been introduced, which do not depend on the ambiguity class of the subtag being predicted any more. This allows to learn also from unambiguous tokens. However, the training time is increased dramatically by doing so in the training data have to be taken 95 Table 1: Training data in numbers Language Training Size Tagset Size Ambiguous Tokens 99903 139 38.65% Czech 87071 970 45.97% Estonian 81383 476 40.24% Hungarian 102992 401 21.58% Romanian 104583 486 40.00% Slovene 94457 1033 38.01% into consideration, as opposed to the case of training the small AC-based model, when only those training events which contain the particular AC are used. 3.3 Variable Distance Condition The &quot;stop&quot; criterion for finding the appropriate relative position was originally based on hard coded choices suitable for the Czech language only, and of course it depended on the tagset as well. This dependency has been removed by selecting the appropriate conditions automatically when building the pool of features at the initialization (using the relative frequency of the POS ambiguity classes, and a threshold to cut off less frequent categories to limit the size of the feature pool). 3.4 Weight Variation Even though the full computation of the appropriate feature weight is still prohibitive (the more so when the general features are added), the learner is now allowed to vary the weights (in several discrete steps) during feature selection, as a (somewhat crude) attempt to depart from the Naive Bayes simplification to the approximation of the &quot;correct&quot; Maximum Entropy estimation. 3.5 Handling Unknown Words In order to compare the effects of (not) using an independent dictionary, we have added an unknown handling module to the It extracts the prefix and suffix frequency information (and the combination thereof) from the training data. Then, for each of the combinations, it selects the most frequent set of tags seen in the training data and stores it for later use. When tagging, the data is first piped through a &quot;guesser&quot; which assigns to the unknown words such a set of possible tags which is stored with the longest matching prefix/suffix combination. 5Also, the use of variable-distance context may be switched off entirely. the code relied exclusively on the use of such an independent dictionary. Since the coverage of the Czech dictionary we have used is extensive, we have been simply ignoring the unknown word problem altogether in the past. Results 4.1 Reporting Error Rate: Words vs. Tokens Since &quot;best-only&quot; tagging has been carried out, the error rate (i.e, 100 accuracy in %) measure has been used throughout as the only evaluation criterion. However, since some results reported previously were apparently obtained using only the &quot;real&quot; words as the total for accuracy evaluation, whereas in other experiments every token counts (including punctuation', for example), we have computed both report them 4.2 Availability of Dictionary Information We use two methods to obtain the set of possible tags for any given word form (i.e., to analyze it morphologically). Both methods include handling unknown words. First, we use only information which may be obtained automatically from the manually corpus (we call this method This is the way the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) runs if one uses the binary version from the website (see the comparison in Section 5). However, it is not unreasonable to assume that a dictionary which can help to obtain a list of possible tags for each word form in test data. This is what we have at our disposal for the languages in question, since the development of such a dictionary was part of the Multext-East project. We can thus assume a dictionary info is available for unknown words in the test data, i.e., even though there is no statistics available for them (since they did not appear in the training data), all tags for every test token are avail- This method is referred to as the following text. We have also used a third method of obtaina dictionary information (called by using only the words from the training data, sometimes a separate token for sentence boundary sTable 1 has been computed using all tokens. In fact, the languages differ significantly in the proportion of punctuation: from about 18% (English) to 30% (Estonian). on the quality of the independent dictionary. Of course, the tagsets must match, which could be a problem per se. Here it is simple, since the dictionaries have been developed using the same tagsets as the tagged data. 96 but complementing the information about them obfrom the training data by including possible tags for such words. Therefore the net result is that during testing, we have only training words at our disposal, but with a complete dictionary information (as if coming from a full morphological The results on the full training data set are summarized in Table 2. The baseline error rate is computed as follows. First of all, we use the independent dictionary for obtaining the possible tags for each word. Then we extract only the lexical information from the current position&quot; and counts used for smoothing (which is based on the ambiguity classes only and it does not use lexical information). The system is then trained normally, which means it uses the lexical information if the AC-based alone does not work. This baseline method is thus very close to the usual baseline method of using simple conditional distribution of tags given words. The message of Table 2 seems to be obvious; but before we jump to conclusions, let's present another set of experiments. In view of the recent interest in dealing with &quot;small languages&quot;, and with regard to the questions of cost-effectiveness of using &quot;human&quot; resources (i.e. annotation vs. rule-writing vs. tools development etc.), we have also performed experiments with reduced training data size (but with an enriched feature pool — by lowering thresholds, adding more of the &quot;general features&quot; as described above, etc. — as by reasonable time/space These results are summarized in Table 3 (using only the dictionary derived from the training data), Table 4 (using words from training data with morphological information complemented from a dictionary) and Table 5 (using the &quot;independent&quot; dictionary). In all cases, we again count only true words (no punctuation). Accordingly, the major POS error rate is reported, too (12 POS tags to be distinguished only: Noun, Verb, Adjective, ...; see Tables 6, 7, and 8). &quot;This arrangement removes the &quot;closed vocabulary&quot; phenomenon from the test data, since for the Multext-East data, we did not have a truly independent vocabulary available. &quot;Words from the training data which are not singletons (freq > 1) are used. Surprisingly enough, it would not hurt to use them too. We believe it is due to the smoothing method used. Even though this is valid only for the baseline experiment, we have observed in general that this form of exponential model (with error-driven training, that is) is remarkably resistant to overtraining. linearly interpolated with global unigram subtag distribution and finally the uniform distribution. &quot;By reasonable we mean less than a day of CPU for training.

We have chosen the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for a comparison with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene reported there (86.360% on of taggers available to us (MBT, the best overall, was not freely available to us at the time of writing). We have trained and tested the Maximum Entropy Tagger on exactly the same data, using the off-the-shelf (java binary only) version. The results are compared in Table 9. Since we want to show how a tagger accuracy is influenced by the amount of training data available, we have run a series of experiments comparing the results of the exponential tagger to the maximum entropy tagger when there is only a limited amount of data available. The results are summarized in Table 10. Since the public version of the MaxEnt tagger cannot be modified to take advantage of neithe the we compared it only to the version of the exponential tagger. To save space, the results are tabulated only for the training data sizes of 2000, 5000 and 20000 words. Again, only the &quot;true&quot; word error rate is reported. As the tables show, for the languages we tested, the exponential, feature-based tagger we adapted from (Haji and Hladka, 1998) achieves similar reas the Maximum Entropy the same data; the &quot;score&quot; is 3:3, with the MaxEnt tagger being substantially on English; probably the development lan- &quot;Otherwise the acknowledged leader in English tagging only substantial difference we noticed was in tagging speed. The runtime speed of the MaxEnt tagger is lower, only about 10 words per second vs. almost 500 words per second; it should be noted however that we are comparing MaxEnt's java bytecode and C. 97 Table 2: Results (Error rate, ER) on full training data, only true words counted (no punctuation) Dictionary: Automatic Mixed Independent Language Baseline Full Baseline Full Baseline Full English 11.42% 9.18% 11.40% 7.91% 7.07% 3.58% Czech 23.02% 18.83% 22.61% 14.78% 19.40% 9.59% Estonian 16.12% 13.95% 16.19% 12.98% 9.94% 5.34% Hungarian 8.35% 8.16% 8.31% 8.00% 3.55% 2.58% Romanian 10.87% 7.76% 10.81% 7.34% 7.49% 3.35% Slovene 20.53% 16.26% 20.01% 13.29% 17.29% 9.00% Table 3: Error rate on reduced training data, dictionary: automatic Language Training data size 1000 2000 5000 10000 20000 Full English 36.20% 29.36% 23.47% 18.27% 14.46% 9.18% Czech 48.22% 42.95% 36.54% 30.97% 27.08% 18.83% Estonian 48.14% 42.10% 32.44% 26.81% 21.51% 13.95% Hungarian 39.68% 32.21% 23.94% 18.04% 13.92% 8.16% Romanian 40.61% 35.02% 25.06% 19.26% 15.16% 7.76% Slovene 45.84% 39.58% 33.12% 28.60% 24.50% 16.26% Table 4: Error rate on reduced training data, dictionary: mixed Language Training data size 1000 2000 5000 10000 20000 Full English 36.15% 29.58% 22.93% 17.70% 14.00% 7.91% Czech 48.97% 41.93% 34.37% 28.10% 23.31% 14.78% Estonian 48.24% 42.79% 32.98% 26.60% 21.02% 12.98% Hungarian 39.87% 32.71% 23.63% 17.98% 13.82% 8.00% Romanian 42.85% 35.70% 25.46% 19.23% 14.81% 7.34% Slovene 46.74% 39.88% 32.00% 26.20% 21.73% 13.29% Table 5: Error rate on reduced training data, dictionary: &quot;independent&quot; Language Training data size 1000 2000 5000 10000 20000 Full English 10.29% 7.64% 5.53% 4.54% 3.83% 3.58% Czech 22.51% 18.07% 17.33% 15.10% 12.62% 9.59% Estonian 13.11% 11.95% 10.70% 9.29% 8.10% 5.34% Hungarian 6.84% 5.35% 4.29% 4.07% 3.48% 2.58% Romanian 13.11% 9.47% 7.81% 6.18% 5.07% 3.35% Slovene 24.63% 19.17% 16.17% 14.12% 12.62% 9.00% bias shows However, when the training data size goes down, the advantage of predicting the single morphological categories separately favors the exponential tagger (with the notable and substantial exception of English). The less data, the larger the difference (Tab 10). the other hand, the Exponential tagger has been developed on Czech originally and it lost on this language. It should be noted that the original version of the exponential tagger did contain more Czech-specific features, and thus might in fact do better. The resulting accuracy (of both taggers) is still unsatisfactory not only from the point of view of results obtained on English, but also from the practical point of view: approx. 85% accuracy (Czech, Slovene) typically means that about five out of six 10-word sentences contain at least one error in it. That is bad news e.g. for parsing projects involving tagging as a preliminary step. 98 Table 6: POS Error rate on reduced training data, dictionary: automatic Language Training data size 1000 2000 5000 10000 20000 Full English 26.77% 20.82% 16.11% 11.86% 9.48% 5.64% Czech 24.32% 20.20% 13.46% 9.70% 7.22% 3.72% Estonian 35.81% 30.52% 23.02% 18.26% 14.31% 8.46% Hungarian 30.54% 24.99% 18.09% 13.15% 10.29% 5.81% Romanian 31.33% 27.59% 19.24% 14.51% 11.25% 5.21% Slovene 27.16% 23.15% 17.01% 12.89% 9.74% 5.61% Table 7: POS Error rate on reduced training data, dictionary: mixed Language Training data size 1000 2000 5000 10000 20000 Full English 26.69% 21.09% 15.82% 11.53% 9.08% 4.94% Czech 24.32% 20.61% 13.47% 10.19% 7.37% 3.76% Estonian 36.48% 31.76% 23.55% 18.21% 14.32% 8.20% Hungarian 30.28% 25.25% 17.59% 12.89% 10.15% 5.64% Romanian 33.56% 28.34% 20.03% 14.52% 11.03% 5.04% Slovene 27.58% 23.30% 16.85% 12.59% 9.88% 5.12% Table 8: POS Error rate on reduced training data, dictionary: &quot;independent&quot; Language Training data size 1000 2000 5000 10000 20000 Full English 6.42% 5.36% 3.63% 3.02% 2.53% 2.43% Czech 3.21% 2.85% 2.17% 2.01% 1.65% 1.12% Estonian 6.71% 6.32% 5.27% 4.31% 3.77% 2.36% Hungarian 5.35% 4.42% 3.39% 3.18% 2.75% 2.04% Romanian 9.51% 6.54% 5.36% 4.00% 3.18% 1.89% Slovene 6.10% 5.19% 4.04% 3.59% 3.25% 2.08% 5 Conclusions 5.1 The Differences Among Languages The following discussion abstracts from the tagset design, relying on the fact that the Multext-East project has been driven by common tagset guidelines to an unprecedented extent, given the very different languages involved. At the same time, we acknowledge that even so, their design for the individual languages might have influenced the results. Also, the quality of the annotation is an important factor; we believe though that the later data we obtained for the experiments described here are within the range of usual human error and do not suffer from First of all, it is clear that these languages differ substantially just by looking at the simple training we are sure that the post-release Slovene and Hungarian data we are using are without annotation defects beyond the usual occasional annotation error, been double checked, and we also believe that the other two languages are reasonably clean. Bulgarian, although present on the CD, is unfortunately unusable since it not annotated; for English, see above. data statistics, where the number of unique tags seen in a relatively small collection of about 100k tokens is high from 401 (Hungarian) to 1033 (Slovene); compare that to English with only 139 tags. However, it is interesting to see that the average per-token ambiguity is much more narrowly distributed, and in fact English ranks 3rd (after Hungarian and Slovene), Czech being the last with almost every other token ambiguous on average. This ambiguity does not correspond with the results obtained: Slovene, being the second least ambiguous, is the second most difficult to tag. Only Czech behaves consistently by tailing the pack in both cases. 5.2 Comparison to Previous Results Any comparison is necessarily difficult due to different evaluation methodologies, even within the &quot;bestonly&quot;, accuracy-based reporting. Nevertheless, we will try. For Romanian, Tufis in his recent work (Tufis, reports accuracy (i.e. 1.5% error rate) on Romanian, using the classifier combination apby e.g. (Brill and Wu, 1998). His 99 Table 10: Error rate comparison on reduced training data, automatic dictionary Training data size 2000 5000 20000 Language ME Exp ME Exp ME Exp English 26.03% 29.36% 17.70% 23.47% 9.61% 14.46% Czech 50.77% 42.95% 41.95% 36.54% 28.16% 27.08% Estonian 51.08% 42.10% 40.09% 32.44% 25.50% 21.51% Hungarian 41.12% 32.21% 30.68% 23.94% 17.27% 13.92% Romanian 42.88% 35.02% 30.07% 25.06% 16.67% 15.16% Slovene 49.46% 39.58% 39.34% 33.12% 27.77% 24.50% results are well above the 3.29% error rate achieved here (with even a larger tagset of 1391 vs. 486 here), but the paper does not say how this number has been computed (training data size, the all-token/wordsonly question) thus making any conclusions difficult to make. He also argues that his method is language independent but no results are mentioned for other languages. For Czech, previous work achieved similar results (6.20% on newspaper text using the all-tokens-based error rate computation, on 160,000 training tokens; vs. 7.04% here on approx. half that amount of training data; same handling of unknown words). This is in line with the expectations, since the same methodology (tagging as well as evaluation) has been used, except the features used in that work were specifically tuned to Czech. The most detailed account of Slovene (Erjavec et al., 1999) reports various results, which might not be directly comparable because it is unclear whether they use the all-tokens-based or words-only computation of the error rate. They report 6.421% error on the full tagset on and 13.583% on all words (tokens?) including unknown words (the exponential tagger we used achieved 13.82% on all tokens, 16.26% on words only). They use almost the same data (Orwell's 1984, but leaving out the They also report that the original Czech-specific exponential tagger used as a basis for the work reported here achieved 7.28% error rate on Slovene on full tags on the same data, which means that by the changes to the exponential tagger aimed at its language independence we introduced in Section 3, we have not achieved any improvement (on Slovene) of the exp. tagger (the error rate stayed at 7.26% using all-tokens-based evaluation numbers, dictionary available; but the data was not exactly the same, presumably). 5.3 Dictionary vs. Training Data This is, according to our opinion, the most interesting result of the experiments described so far. As tag count is lower (1021) than here (1033), but that's not really relevant. They do not report the average ambiguity or a similar measure. already Table 2 clearly suggests, even the baseline tagging results obtained with the help of an independent dictionary are comparable (if not better) than the fully-trained tagger on 100k words, but without the dictionary information. The situation is even clearer when comparing the POS-only results: here the &quot;independent&quot; dictionary results are better by far, with almost no training data needed. Looking at the characteristics of the languages, it is apparent that the inflections cause the problem: the coverage of a previously unseen text is inferior to the usual coverage of English or another analytical language. Therefore, unless we can come up with a really clever way of learning rules for dealing with previously unseen words, it is clearly strongly preferto work on a morphological rather than to try to annotate more data. 6 Future Work We would like to compare more taggers using still other methodologies, especially the MBT tagger, which achieved the best results on Slovene but which was not available to us at the time of writing this paper. Obviously, we would also like to use the classifier combination method on them, to confirm the really surprisingly good results on Romanian and test it on the other languages as well. We would also like to enrich the best taggers available today (such as the Maximum Entropy tagger) by using the dictionary information available and compare the results with the exponential featurebased tagger we have been using in the experiments here. For Czech and Slovene, the results are still far below what one would like to see (in absolute terms). It seems that the key lies in the initial feature set definition including statistical tagset clustering, which might potentially lead to more reliable estimates of certain parameters while using still the same size of training data. &quot;Not necessarily manually apparently, even a partially supervised method would be of tremendous help. 100 7 Acknowledgements The author wishes to thank many Multext-East participants for their efforts to improve the original data, especially to Niki PetkeviZ, Tomaz Erjavec, Heiki-Jaan Kaalep and Gabor Proszeky, and for providing the final versions of the annotated data for the experiments.

Wall Street Journal part in the Penn Treebank, for example). Highly inflective and agglutinative languages are different. Obviously we can limit the number of tags to the major part-of-speech classes, plus some (like the Xerox Language Tools (Chanod, 1997) for such languages do), and in fact achieve similar performance, but that limits the usefulness of the results thus obtained for further analysis. These languages, obviously, do not use the rich inflection just for the amusement (or embarrassment) of their speakers (or NLP researchers): the inflectional categories carry important information which ought to be known at a later time (e.g., during parsing). Thus one wants not only to tell apart verbs from nouns, but also nominative from genitive, masculine animate from inanimate, singular from plural - all of them being often ambiguous one way o

Therefore the number of tags selected for an English tagset is not that large (40-75 in the typical case). Also, the average ambiguity is 
ly obtained using only the &quot;real&quot; words as the total for accuracy evaluation, whereas in other experiments every token counts (including punctuation', for example), we have computed both and report them separately9. 4.2 Availability of Dictionary Information We use two methods to obtain the set of possible tags for any given word form (i.e., to analyze it morphologically). Both methods include handling unknown words. First, we use only information which may be obtained automatically from the manually annotated corpus (we call this method automatic). This is the way the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) runs if one uses the binary version from the website (see the comparison in Section 5). However, it is not unreasonable to assume that a larger independent dictionary exists which can help to obtain a list of possible tags for each word form in test data. This is what we have at our disposal for the languages in question, since the development of such a dictionary was part of the Multext-East project. We can thus assume a dictionary info is available for unknown words in the test data, i.e., even though there is no statistics available for them (since they did not appear in the training data)
. &quot;By reasonable we mean less than a day of CPU for training. Table 9: Exponential w/feature selection vs. Maximum Entropy tagger (Words-only Error Rate, no dictionary) Language Tagger Exp.

We have chosen the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for a comparison with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene as reported there (86.360% on all tokens) of taggers available to us (MBT, the best overall, was not freely available to us at the time of writing). We have trained and tested the Maximum Entropy Tagger on exactly the same data, using the off-the-shelf (java binary only) version. The results are compared in Table 9. Since we want to show how a tagger accuracy is influenced by the amount of training data available, we have run a series of experiments comparing the results of the

, singular from plural - all of them being often ambiguous one way or the other. The average tagset, as found even in a moderate corpus, contains between 500 and 1,000 distinct tags - whereas the size of the set of possible and plausible tags can reach 3,000 to 5,000. Obviously, any of the statistical methods used for English (even if fully supervised) clash with (or, fall through) the data sparseness problem (see below Table 1 for details). There have been attempts to solve this problem for some of the highly inflectional European languages ((Daelemans et al., 1996), (Erjavec et al., 1999), (Tufis, 1999), and also our own in (Hajit and Hladka., 1997), (Haji t and Hladka, 1998), see also below), but so far no method nor a tagger has been evaluated against a larger number of those languages in a similar setting, to allow for a side-byside comparison of the difficulty (or ease) of full morphological tagging of those languages. Thanks to the Multext-East project (Veronis, 1996a), there are now five annotated corpora available (which are manually fully morphologically tagged) to perform such experiments. 2 The Languages Used and The Training Data We use the Multext-East-annotated version of the Or
owly distributed, and in fact English ranks 3rd (after Hungarian and Slovene), Czech being the last with almost every other token ambiguous on average. This ambiguity does not correspond with the results obtained: Slovene, being the second least ambiguous, is the second most difficult to tag. Only Czech behaves consistently by tailing the pack in both cases. 5.2 Comparison to Previous Results Any comparison is necessarily difficult due to different evaluation methodologies, even within the &quot;bestonly&quot;, accuracy-based reporting. Nevertheless, we will try. For Romanian, Tufis in his recent work (Tufis, 1999) reports 98.5% accuracy (i.e. 1.5% error rate) on Romanian, using the classifier combination approach advocated by e.g. (Brill and Wu, 1998).
