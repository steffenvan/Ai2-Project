Abstract
This paper presents the syntactic and semantic
tags used to annotate predicate-argument
structure in the Berkeley FrameNet Project. It
briefly explains the theory of frame semantics
on which semantic annotation is based,
discusses possible applications of FrameNet
annotation, and compares FrameNet to other
prominent lexical resources.
Introduction
This paper presents the tagset used to annotate
the predicate-argument structures of English
verbs, adjectives, and nouns in the Berkeley
FrameNet Project (NSF IRI-9618838, &quot;Tools for
Lexicon Building&quot;), a corpus-based
computational lexicography project based on the
theory of frame semantics (see Fillmore 1982).
It briefly explains the theoretical background and
shows how frame-semantic annotation creates
lexicographic generalizations that are not
possible with more traditional linguistic
approaches to argument structure based on
thematic roles.
1 The FrameNet Project
1.1 What is frame semantics?
Frame semantics characterizes the semantic and
syntactic properties of predicating words by
relating them to semantic frames. These are
schematic representations of situations involving
various participants, props, and other conceptual
roles, each of which is a frame element (FE).
The semantic arguments of a predicating word
correspond to the FEs of the frame or frames
associated with that word.
Frames are organized in a structure that can
be modeled by an inheritance lattice. They range
from being very general, like case frames
(Fillmore 1968) or other simple event schemas
underlying thematic roles, to being lexically
specific. The most interesting frames are those at
an intermediate level of specificity which
encapsulate generalizations about the semantic
and syntactic properties of word classes that are
overlooked by thematic role analyses.
1.2 An example
One example is the commercial transaction
frame, which includes the following FEs: Buyer,
Seller, Goods, and Money. The following
sentence schemas show how these FEs are
expressed differently by different Commercial
Transaction words:
Buyer bought Goods from Seller for Money
Buyer paid Seller Money for Goods
Buyer paid Money to Seller for Goods
Seller sold goods to Buyer for Money
Seller sold Buyer Goods for Money
Buyer spent Money on Goods
(Seller not expressed)
Goods cost Buyer Money
(Seller not expressed)
Different words assign the Commercial
Transaction FEs to different Phrase Types (PTs)
and Grammatical Functions (GFs). For example,
buy treats the Buyer as an NP subject (i.e.
56
External Argument) and the Seller as a PP
complement headed by from, while sell treats the
Buyer as a direct object or a PP complement
headed by to and the Seller as a subject. The
purpose of FrameNet annotation is to gather
information like this about the grammatical
realization of FEs for various frames.
1.2 Project goals
The goals of the project are to create a database
of information about English words and the
frames they inherit, provide annotated corpus
examples that illustrate how information about
FEs is expressed by complements and modifiers
of these words in attested sentences, and
contribute to a suite of software tools to support
annotation, database building, and database
interface.
An important part of FrameNet work is the
annotation of corpus sentences with framesemantic information. We use the British
National Corpus (BNC), because no equally
comprehensive corpus exists for American
English (though efforts are underway to create a
comparable American National Corpusâ€”see
Fillmore et al. 1998). Each annotated example
sentence shows argument-structure properties of
one target verb, adjective or noun. The main
task of annotation is to tag the arguments (and
occasionally modifiers) of the target with the
names of the FEs that they express. A secondary
task is to mark other lexicographically relevant
elements, such as support verbs of target nouns,
and certain non-meaningful elements that
indicate lexicographically relevant grammatical
constructions (e.g. extraposition and the
existential construction). (See Fillmore & Atkins
1998 on lexicographic relevance.)
Here is an example sentence from the BNC
showing the annotation properties of the
complements of the target verb tell:
(1) [Maltravers (Speaker, NP, Ext)] decided not
to tell
[Stephen (Addressee, NP, Obj)]
[about the inscription in the Le Carre book
(Topic, PPabout, Comp)].
The annotated constituents appear in brackets.
Following each constituent is a set of
parentheses containing the FE, PT and GF
associated with that constituent (actual
annotations consist of XML markup created
using the Alembic Workbench software from the
Mitre Corporation). PT and GF information is
added by an automatic phrase labeler developed
by the technical team.
2 The FrameNet tagset
2.1 Phrase Types
Below are the FrameNet Phrase Types. This is
intended to be a comprehensive list of the types
of syntactic constituent that can express FEs of
major predicating words of English (nouns,
verbs and adjectives). These constituents occur
either as arguments or as lexicographically
relevant modifiers. In constructing this list, we
made extensive reference to the Comlex syntax
(Meyers et al. 1995).
2.1.1 Noun phrase types
NP Noun phrase (the witness)
Non-maximal nominal (personal chat)
Poss Possessive NP (the child's decision)
There Expletive there (there was a fight)
It Expletive it (it's nice that you came)
2.1.2 Prepositional phrase types
PP Prepositional phrase (look at me)
Ping PP with gerundive object (keepfrom
laughing)
Part Particle(look it up)
2.1.3 Verb phrase types
VPfin Finite verb phrase (we ate fish)
VPbrst Bare stem VP (let us eat fish)
VPto To-marked infinitive VP (we want to eat
fish)
VPwh wH-VP (we know how to win)
VPing Gerundive VP (we like winning)
2.1.4 Complement clause types
Sfin Finite clause (it's nice that you came)
Swh WH-clause (ask who won)
Sif Iflwhether clause (ask if we won)
Sing Gerundive clause (we saw them running)
Sto To-marked clause (we want them to win)
Sforto For-to-marked clause (we would like for
them to win)
Sbrst Bare stem clause (we insist that they
win)
57
In certain cases FrameNet marks as two
constituents what are treated as &quot;small clauses&quot;
in some analyses. For example, in the sentence I
consider Pat a genius, Pat and a genius would
be tagged separately.
2.1.5 Other phrase types
AjP Adjective phrase (an interesting idea)
AdvP Adverb phrase (you put that nicely)
Quo Quote (&quot;Indeed,&quot; she said)
2.2 Grammatical Functions
Below is a list of the FrameNet GFs. This list is
intended to characterize all the grammatical
contexts relative to English verbs, adjectives and
nouns that are regularly occupied by FEexpressing constituents. In this list, we do not
make the traditional distinction between obliques
and arguments/complements (the former are
simply PP complements).
2.2.1 FrameNet grammatical functions
Ext External Argument
(Argument outside phrase headed by target verb,
adjective or noun)
Comp Complement
(Argument inside phrase headed by target verb,
adjective or noun)
Mod Modifier
(Non-argument expressing FE of target verb,
adjective or noun)
Xtrap Extraposed
(Verbal or clausal complement extraposed to end
of VP)
Obj Object
(Post-verbal argument; passivizable or does not
alternate with PP)
Pred Predicate
(Secondary predicate complement of target verb
or adjective)
Head Head
(Head nominal in attributive use of target
adjective)
Gen Genitive Determiner
(Genitive Determiner of nominal headed by
target)
2.3 Nonexpression of FEs
Besides being expressed by the PTs and GFs
listed above, FEs may remain unexpressed under
the different conditions discussed below (see
Fillmore 1986).
2.3.1 Indefinite Null Instantiation
In sentence (1), the FEs Message, Medium and
Code are not expressed. It can however be
inferred that there must be a Message, Medium
and Code in a communicative event of the type
described by this sentence. These FEs, while
conceptually present in this sentence, are
optionally expressed, and there are no particular
restrictions on their nonexpression. This is called
Indefinite Null Instantiation (IN!).
2.3.2 Definite Null Instantiation
With some words, an FE may be unexpressed in
a sentence only if it assumed that the person to
whom the sentence is addressed has specific
information about the frame element in question.
This kind of non-expression is called Definite
Null Instantiation (DNI). For example, the
words tell, inform and notify allow a Message to
be omitted when it is clear what the Message is,
e.g. How did I know you won? Because Pat
already told me.
2.3.3 Constructionally licensed null
instantiation
Certain grammatical constructions, such as
Passive and Imperative, allow an External
Argument FE to be unexpressed, e.g. Harsh
things were said, Tell me about yourself This is
Constructionally Licensed Null Instantiation
(CNI).
FrameNet annotation marks prominent
unexpressed FEs as well as FEs that are
expressed overtly. In order to achieve this, we
place the symbols IN!, DNI and CNI
immediately after the target word in every
annotated sentence, and place the appropriate FE
tag on the appropriate symbol. For example, the
case of DNI discussed above would be annotated
as follows:
(2) [Pat (Speaker)] already told IN! [DNI
(Message)] CNI [me (Addressee)].

2.4 Frame Elements
Frames are organized into the following
domains: Body, Chance, Cognition,
Communication, Emotion, Health, Life Stages,
Motion, Perception, Society, Space, Time,
Transaction, and a General domain. Each
domain contains several frames that characterize
different word classes. Because there are many
frames, it is not possible to give the complete list
of FEs. The next section discusses FEs from the
Communication domain.
3 Communication frames
It is typically the case that different frames in the
same domain share FEs. For that reason, each
domain can be characterized by a basic frame
that defines its FEs in general terms, and more
specific frames, corresponding to word classes,
that are based on this basic frame through
inheritance or some other principled relation. Let
us consider the basic frame of verbal
communication.
3.1 Basic Verbal Communication frame
The following FEs consistently appear in frames
relating to verbal communication:
Speaker
(A person who performs an act of verbal
communication)
Addressee
(An actual or intended recipient of a verbal
message)
Message
(A communicated proposition)
Topic
(The subject matter of a message)
Medium
(A physical channel of communication)
Code
(The language or other code used to
communicate)
These FEs all derive their meaning from the
concept of a basic communicative event. Clearly
a true frame representation cannot just consist of
a list of role names, but must characterize such
events. Currently FrameNet frame descriptions
exist only in text form, but the ultimate aim is to
express them in a machine-readable format. An
important component of such a representation
will be feature structures that express relations
between frames symbolically. These might be
combined with computational event models that
are able to generate inferences, such as the xschemas developed by Bailey et al. (1997) and
Narayanan (1997).
The FEs of the Basic Verbal Communication
frame are relevant to sentence (1) above, in
which the Speaker is expressed as an NP Ext, the
Addressee is expressed as an NP Obj, and the
Topic is expressed as a PP Comp headed by
about. The other FEs are not expressed.
We will examine how the FEs above are
realized in different Communication frames, and
in the process, will see some of the kinds of
generalizations that can be expressed through
frame-semantic lexical analysis.
3.2 Other frames in the Communication domain
The Basic Verbal Communication frame
characterizes events of verbal communication in
the most general terms. Different
Communication words represent different types
of communicative event and different ways of
construing such events. Generalizations over
these words are captured by different frames in
the domain. Some focus on, or profile, in
Langacker's (1987) terminology, the relation
between a Speaker and a propositional Message.
These are grouped into frames characterizing
different speech acts, e.g. asking (Questioning
frame), requesting (Request frame), asserting
(Statement frame), and promising (Commitment
frame). A few words profile the relation between
a Speaker and an act of speaking, but not the
propositional Message communicated (talk,
speak). Some denote events of reciprocal
communication (e.g. discuss, argue,
conversation, etc.). And so on.
The following sections summarize properties
of specific frames, and discuss some
assumptions about the ontology of the
Communication domain that might account for
these properties.
3.3 The Statement frame
Verbs and nouns in the Statement frame profile a
relation between a Speaker and a propositional
59
Message that has the speech act status of an
assertion. Because of the importance of the
Message FE, these words frequently occur with
Sfin Comp (finite clausal complements):
(3) [Others (Speaker, NP, Ext)] assert [that
anthropology is the tree and sociology the branch
(Message, Sfin, Comp)].
(4) [Managers (Speaker, NP, Ext)] claim [there
was no radiological ha77ard to staff or the public
(Message, Sfin, Comp)].
(5) [His (Speaker, Poss, Gen)] claims [to have
more energy (Message, VPto, Comp)] are simply
laughable.
Message can be expressed with different PPs as
well. For example, with the target noun claim, it
can be expressed as a to-marked infinitive VP, as
in example (5).
3.4 The Speaking frame
Verbs and nouns in the Speaking frame profile a
relation between a Speaker and an act of
speaking, but do no allow a Message to be
expressed:
(6) [She (Speaker, NP, Ext)] never spoke [about
her feelings (Topic, PP about, Comp)].
This fact can be explained if we analyze the
basic meaning of Speaking words as being
something like 'X say something'. The Message
role can be thought of as being incorporated
into this meaning, with incorporation in this case
being equivalent to obligatory INI.
3.5 The Request frame
Like words in the Statement frame, these words
frequently occur with clausal Complements.
However, because these Complements express
requests rather that assertions, they often occur
as bare stem clauses:
(7) In all cases [the respondent (Speaker, NP,
Ext)] may request [in writing (Medium, PPin,
Comp)] [that the disciplinary findings be
published (Message, Sbrst, Comp)].
3.6 The Conversation frame
One class of words in the Communication
domain does not use the FEs Speaker and
Addressee as they occur in other frames. These
are nouns and verbs or reciprocal
communication, which are treated in the
Conversation frame. In this frame, the human
interlocutors can be expressed in separate
constituents, assigned the roles Protagonist-1
(Prot-1) and Protagonist-2 (Prot-2), or they can
be expressed in a single conjoined or plural
constituent, assigned the role Protagonists
(Prots).
This class of words demonstrates the
complex interaction of frames. The FEs Prot-1,
Prot-2 and Prots are not equivalent to any of the
Basic Verbal Communication FEs, but do relate
to them in a regular way. Each of these roles
must be thought of as relating to two or more
Communicative subevents, and as corresponding
to a Speaker in some and an Addressee in others.
This basic structure is taken not from any frame
in the domain of Communication, but from a
Reciprocity frame, which is in the General
domain. The Reciprocity frame may be thought
of as an Aktionsart frame that structures events
and relations from other frames in a particular
way, such that there are multiple subeventualities
of the same type as that of the input frame, and
the bindings or fillers of the roles are reversed
from one subeventuality to the another.
The complexity introduced by frames such
as these points to the need to distinguish between
conceptual roles and FEs in any given frame.
While the Communication roles Speaker and
Addressee are not FEs in the Conversation
frame, they are conceptual roles, because the
conceptual representation of Conversation makes
reference to them. (In the Speaking frame
discussed above, we can also think of the
incorporated Message role as being a conceptual
role rather than an FE.) FEs in any given frame
should therefore be defined as those roles for
which the frame specifies conventional means of
syntactic expression, even if these means are not
employed in all sentences.
3.6.1 Disjoint expression: Prot-1 and Prot-2
Here is a BNC example of argue with a disjoint
expression of interlocutors:
(8) &quot;[You (Prot-1, NP, Ext)] can't argue
[politics (Topic, NP, Comp)] [with foreigners
(Prot-2, PPwith, Comp)]&quot;, sighed the policeman.
Prot-2, the less prominent interlocutor, is
regularly expressed in this frame by a PP Comp
60
headed by with. This is consistent with the
general behavior of the Reciprocity frame as it
occurs in combination with other frames and
domains (e.g. Pat had a
collision/relationship/agreement with Kim).
3.6.2 Joint expression: Protagonists
Here are BNC examples of the joint expression
of interlocuters with argue:
(9) [They (Prots, NP, Ext)] argued [angrily
(Manner, AdvP, Mod)] [over who was the real
&quot;Prince of Sleaze&quot; (Topic, PPover, Comp)].
(10) [Mr. and Mrs. Popple (Prots, NP, Ext)]
always argued [INI (Topic)] at least once a
week.
3.7 FrameNet complements existing lexical
resources
FrameNet annotations provide more detail than
existing lexical resources about the way in which
particular semantic roles (i.e. FEs) are linked
with particular means of syntactic expression.
Since different senses of ambiguous words are
defined relative to different frames, this linking
information could potentially be used for lexical
disambiguation.
For example, consider the verb argue as it is
treated in the WordNet database (Fellbaum
1998). Below are the three WordNet senses of
argue, and the sentence frames that are
associated with each sense:
Sense 1: argue, reason â€” (present reasons and
arguments)
EX: Sam and Sue argue
EX: Sam wants to argue with Sue
Sense 2: argue, contend, debate, fence â€” (have
an argument about something)
EX: Sam and Sue argue
EX; Sam wants to argue with Sue
Sense 3: argue, indicate â€” (give evidence of;
&quot;The evidence argues for your claim&quot;; &quot;The
results indicate the need for more work&quot;)
The three senses listed above correspond to three
different frames: Sense 1 corresponds to the
Statement frame, Sense 2 to the Conversation
frame, and Sense 3 to the Evidence frame in the
Cognition domain. However, the information
about sentence frames provided in WordNet
does not correspond to the generalizations that
are apparent in FrameNet. For example,
WordNet gives the same sentence frames for
Senses 1 and 2, while in the FrameNet database,
the senses of argue defined relative to the
Statement and Conversation frames are
characterized by different argument structures:
only Statement argue allows finite clausal
complements expressing Message; Conversation
argue has the properties of other reciprocal
communication words, which Statement argue
lacks, and does not allow clausal Complements
(or any other expression of Message).
COMLEX (Meyers et al. 1995) recognizes
the syntactic frames in which argue occurs, but
does not provide information about the linking of
syntactic constituents with semantic roles, or
about the different complementation properties
of different senses of ambiguous words.
Conclusion
FrameNet semantic annotation captures human
knowledge about the ways in which semantic
roles (FEs) are conventionally expressed by
different words in various word classes and
domains. The kind of information in the
FrameNet database is not expressed in the same
level of depth in any existing print dictionary or
computational lexical resource. While WordNet
describes semantic relations between words, it
does not recognize the conceptual schemas, i.e.
frames, that mediate in these relations, and
therefore does not have the means to link
arguments of predicating words with the
semantic roles they express. COMLEX and
NOMLEX provide detailed information about
the syntactic frames in which verbs and nouns
occur, but also lack a means to link syntactic
arguments with semantic roles. FrameNet
therefore provides information that complements
major existing lexical resources.

It can however be inferred that there must be a Message, Medium and Code in a communicative event of the type described by this sentence. These FEs, while conceptually present in this sentence, are optionally expressed, and there are no particular restrictions on their nonexpression. This is called Indefinite Null Instantiation (IN!). 2.3.2 Definite Null Instantiation With some words, an FE may be unexpressed in a sentence only if it assumed that the person to whom the sentence is address

The main task of annotation is to tag the arguments (and occasionally modifiers) of the target with the names of the FEs that they express. A secondary task is to mark other lexicographically relevant elements, such as support verbs of target nouns, and certain non-meaningful elements that indicate lexicographically relevant grammatical constructions (e.g. extraposition and the existential construction). (See Fillmore & Atkins 1998 on lexicographic relevance.) Here is an example sentence from the BNC showing the annotation properties of the complements of the target verb tell: (1) [Maltravers (Speaker, NP, Ext)] decided not to tell [Stephen (Addressee, NP, Obj)] [about the inscription in the Le Carre book (Topic, PPabout, Comp)]. The annotated constituents appear in brackets. Following each constituent is a set of parentheses containing the FE, PT and GF associated with that constituent (actual annotations consist of XML markup created using the Alembic Workbench software from the Mitre Corporation).

sh words and the frames they inherit, provide annotated corpus examples that illustrate how information about FEs is expressed by complements and modifiers of these words in attested sentences, and contribute to a suite of software tools to support annotation, database building, and database interface. An important part of FrameNet work is the annotation of corpus sentences with framesemantic information. We use the British National Corpus (BNC), because no equally comprehensive corpus exists for American English (though efforts are underway to create a comparable American National Corpusâ€”see Fillmore et al. 1998). Each annotated example sentence shows argument-structure properties of one target verb, adjective or noun. The main task of annotation is to tag the arguments (and occasionally modifiers) of the target with the names of the FEs that they express.

PT and GF information is added by an automatic phrase labeler developed by the technical team. 2 The FrameNet tagset 2.1 Phrase Types Below are the FrameNet Phrase Types. This is intended to be a comprehensive list of the types of syntactic constituent that can express FEs of major predicating words of English (nouns, verbs and adjectives). These constituents occur either as arguments or as lexicographically relevant modifiers. In constructing this list, we made extensive reference to the Comlex syntax (Meyers et al. 1995). 2.1.1 Noun phrase types NP Noun phrase (the witness) Non-maximal nominal (personal chat) Poss Possessive NP (the child's decision) There Expletive there (there was a fight) It Expletive it (it's nice that you came) 2.1.2 Prepositional phrase types PP Prepositional phrase (look at me) Ping PP with gerundive object (keepfrom laughing) Part Particle(look it up) 2.1.3 Verb phrase types VPfin Finite verb phrase (we ate fish) VPbrst Bare stem VP (let us eat fish) VPto To-marked infinitive VP (we want to eat fish) VPwh wH-VP (we know how to win) VPing Gerundive VP (we like winning) 2.1.4 Complement
mes provided in WordNet does not correspond to the generalizations that are apparent in FrameNet. For example, WordNet gives the same sentence frames for Senses 1 and 2, while in the FrameNet database, the senses of argue defined relative to the Statement and Conversation frames are characterized by different argument structures: only Statement argue allows finite clausal complements expressing Message; Conversation argue has the properties of other reciprocal communication words, which Statement argue lacks, and does not allow clausal Complements (or any other expression of Message). COMLEX (Meyers et al. 1995) recognizes the syntactic frames in which argue occurs, but does not provide information about the linking of syntactic constituents with semantic roles, or about the different complementation properties of different senses of ambiguous words. Conclusion FrameNet semantic annotation captures human knowledge about the ways in which semantic roles (FEs) are conventionally expressed by different words in various word classes and domains. The kind of information in the FrameNet database is not expressed in the same level of depth in any existing print dictionary or computational lexical resource.

 derive their meaning from the concept of a basic communicative event. Clearly a true frame representation cannot just consist of a list of role names, but must characterize such events. Currently FrameNet frame descriptions exist only in text form, but the ultimate aim is to express them in a machine-readable format. An important component of such a representation will be feature structures that express relations between frames symbolically. These might be combined with computational event models that are able to generate inferences, such as the xschemas developed by Bailey et al. (1997) and Narayanan (1997). The FEs of the Basic Verbal Communication frame are relevant to sentence (1) above, in which the Speaker is expressed as an NP Ext, the Addressee is expressed as an NP Obj, and the Topic is expressed as a PP Comp headed by about. The other FEs are not expressed. We will examine how the FEs above are realized in different Communication frames, and in the process, will see some of the kinds of generalizations that can be expressed through frame-semantic lexical analysis. 3.2 Other frames in the Communication domain The Basic Verbal Communication frame characterizes events of verbal communicati
