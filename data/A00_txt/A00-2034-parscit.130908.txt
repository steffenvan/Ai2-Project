Abstract
We propose a method for identifying diathesis alternations where a particular argument type is seen in
slots which have different grammatical roles in the
alternating forms. The method uses selectional preferences acquired as probability distributions over
WordNet. Preferences for the target slots are compared using a measure of distributional similarity.
The method is evaluated on the causative and conative alternations, but is generally applicable and
does not require a priori knowledge specific to the
alternation.
1 Introduction
Diathesis alternations are alternate ways in which
the arguments of a verb are expressed syntactically.
The syntactic changes are sometimes accompanied
by slight changes in the meaning of the verb. An example of the causative alternation is given in (1) below. In this alternation, the object of the transitive
variant can also appear as the subject of the intransitive variant. In the conative alternation, the transitive form alternates with a prepositional phrase construction involving either at or on. An example of
the conative alternation is given in (2).
1. The boy broke the window The window
broke.
2. The boy pulled at the rope The boy pulled
the rope.
We refer to alternations where a particular semantic role appears in different grammatical roles in alternate realisations as &quot;role switching alternations&quot;
(RsAs). It is these alternations that our method applies to.
Recently, there has been interest in corpus-based
methods to identify alternations (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999), and associated verb
classifications (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999). These
have either relied on a priori knowledge specified for
the alternations in advance, or are not suitable for
a wide range of alternations. The fully automatic
method outlined here is applied to the causative
and conative alternations, but is applicable to other
RSAS.
2 Motivation
Diathesis alternations have been proposed for a
number of NLP tasks. Several researchers have suggested using them for improving lexical acquisition.
Korhonen (1997) uses them in subcategorization
frame (scF) acquisition to improve the performance
of a statistical filter which determines whether a
SCF observed for a particular verb is genuine or not.
They have also been suggested for the recovery of
predicate argument structure, necessary for SCF acquisition (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Boguraev and
Briscoe, 1987). And Ribas (1995) showed that selectional preferences acquired using alternations performed better on a word sense disambiguation task
compared to preferences acquired without alternations. He used alternations to indicate where the
argument head data from different slots can be combined since it occupies the same semantic relationship with the predicate.
Different diathesis alternations give different emphasis and nuances of meaning to the same basic
content. These subtle changes of meaning are important in natural language generation (Stede, 1998).
Alternations provide a means of reducing redundancy in the lexicon since the alternating scFs need
not be enumerated for each individual verb if a
marker is used to specify which verbs the alternation applies to. Alternations also provide a means
of generalizing patterns of behaviour over groups of
verbs, typically the group members are semantically
related. Levin (1993) provides a classification of over
3000 verbs according to their participation in alternations involving NP and PP constituents. Levin's
classification is not intended to be exhaustive. Automatic identification of alternations would be a useful tool for extending the classification with new
participants. Levin's taxonomy might also be used
alongside observed behaviour, to predict unseen behaviour.
Levin's classification has been extended by other
NLP researchers (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dang et al.,

1998). Dang et al. (1998) modify it by adding new
classes which remove the overlap between classes
from the original scheme. Dorr and Jones (1996)
extend the classification by using grammatical information in LDOCE alongside semantic information
in WordNet. What is missing is a way of classifying
verbs when the relevant information is not available
in a manmade resource. Using corpora by-passes
reliance on the availability and adequacy of mRDs.
Additionally, the frequency information in corpora is
helpful for estimating alternation productivity (Lapata, 1999). Estimations of productivity have been
suggested for controlling the application of alternations (Briscoe and Copestake, 1996). We propose a
method to acquire knowledge of alternation participation directly from corpora, with frequency information available as a by-product.
3 Method
We use both syntactic and semantic information for
identifying participants in RsAs. Firstly, syntactic
processing is used to find candidates taking the alternating SCFS. Secondly, selectional preference models
are acquired for the argument heads associated with
a specific slot in a specific SCF of a verb.
We use the SCF acquisition system of Briscoe and
Carroll (1997), with a probabilistic LR parser (Inui et
al., 1997) for syntactic processing. The corpus data
is POS tagged and lemmatised before the LR parser
is applied. Subcategorization patterns are extracted
from the parses, these include both the syntactic categories and the argument heads of the constituents.
These subcategorization patterns are then classified
according to a set of 161 SCF classes. The SCF entries for each verb are then subjected to a statistical
filter which removes scFs that have occurred with
a frequency less than would be expected by chance.
The resulting SCF lexicon lists each verb with the
scFs it takes. Each SCF entry includes a frequency
count and lists the argument heads at all slots.
Selectional preferences are automatically acquired
for the slots involved in the role switching. We refer
to these as the target slots. For the causative alternation, the slots are the direct object slot of the
transitive SCF and the subject slot of the intransitive. For the conative, the slots are the direct object
of the transitive and the PP of the up v pp SCF.
Selectional preferences are acquired using the
method devised by Li and Abe (1995). The preferences for a slot are represented as a tree cut model
(Tcm). This is a set of disjoint classes that partition
the leaves of the WordNet noun hypernym hierarchy. A conditional probability is attached to each of
the classes in the set. To ensure the TCM covers all
the word senses in WordNet, we modify Li and Abe's
original scheme by creating hyponym leaf classes below all WordNet's hypernym (internal) classes. Each
leaf holds the word senses previously held at the internal class. The nominal argument heads from a
target slot are collected and used to populate the
WordNet hierarchy with frequency information. The
head lemmas are matched to the classes which contain them as synonyms. Where a lemma appears as a
synonym in more than one class, its frequency count
is divided between all classes for which it has direct
membership. The frequency counts from hyponym
classes are added to the count for each hypernym
class. A root node, created above all the WordNet
roots, contains the total frequency count for all the
argument head lemmas found within WordNet. The
minimum description length principle (MDL) (Rissanen, 1978) is used to find the best TCM by consid
257
ering the cost (in bits) of describing both the model
and the argument head data encoded in the model.
The cost (or description length) for a TCM is calculated according to equation 1. The number of
parameters of the model is given by k, this is the
number of classes in the TCM minus one. S is the
sample size of the argument head data. The cost of
describing each argument head (n) is calculated using the log of the probability estimate for the classes
on the TCM that n belongs to (ca).
description length = —k x log ISI — E log p(cr,) (1)

nES
A small portion of the TCM for the object slot of
start in the transitive frame is displayed in figure 1.
WordNet classes are displayed in boxes with a label
which best reflects the sense of the class. The probability estimates are shown for the classes along the
TCM. Examples of the argument head data are displayed below the WordNet classes with dotted lines
indicating membership at a hyponym class beneath
these classes.
We assume that verbs which participate will show
a higher degree of similarity between the preferences
at the target slots compared with non-participating
verbs. To compare the preferences we compare the
probability distributions across WordNet using a
measure of distributional similarity. Since the probability distributions may be at different levels of
WordNet, we map the Tcms at the target slots to a
common tree cut, a &quot;base cut&quot;. We experiment with
two different types of base cut. The first is simply a
base cut at the eleven root classes of WordNet. We
refer to this as the &quot;root base cut&quot; (RBC). The second is termed the &quot;union base cut&quot; (PBc). This is
obtained by taking all classes from the union of the
two Tcms which are not subsumed by another class
in this union. Duplicates are removed. Probabilities
are assigned to the classes of a base cut using the
estimates on the original TCM. The probability estimate for a hypernym class is obtained by combining
the probability estimates for all its hyponyms on the
original cut. Figure 2 exemplifies this process for two
Tcms (Tcml and Tcm2) in an imaginary hierarchy.
The UBC is at the classes B, C and D.
To quantify the similarity between the probability
distributions for the target slots we use the a-skew
divergence (asp) proposed by Lee (1999). 1 This
measure, defined in equation 2, is a smoothed version
of the Kulback-Liebler divergence. p1(x) and p2(x)
are the two probability distributions which are being
compared. The a constant is a value between 0 and
We also experimented with euclidian distance, the LI
norm, and cosine measures. The differences in performance
of these measures were not statistically significant.
1 which smooths p1(x) with p2(x) so that asri is
always defined. We use the same value (0.99) for a
as Lee. If a is set to 1 then this measure is equivalent
to the Kulback-Liebler divergence.
asd(p1(x),p2(x)) = D(p2(x)11((a x pl(x)) ±
((1 — a) x p2(x)))) (2)
4 Experimental Evaluation
We experiment with a SCF lexicon produced from
19.3 million words of parsed text from the BNC
(Leech, 1992). We used the causative and conative
alternations, since these have enough candidates in
our lexicon for experimentation. Evaluation is performed on verbs already filtered by the syntactic
processing. The SCF acquisition system has been
evaluated elsewhere (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).
We selected candidate verbs which occurred with
10 or more nominal argument heads at the target
slots. The argument heads were restricted to those
which can be classified in the WordNet hypernym hierarchy. Candidates were selected by hand so as to
obtain an even split between candidates which did
participate in the alternation (positive candidates)
and those which did not (negative candidates). Four
human judges were used to determine the &quot;gold standard&quot;. The judges were asked to specify a yes or
no decision on participation for each verb. They
were also permitted a don't know verdict. The kappa
statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) was calculated
to ensure that there was significant agreement between judges for the initial set of candidates. From
these, verbs were selected which had 75% or more
agreement, i.e. three or more judges giving the same
yes or no decision for the verb.
For the causative alternation we were left with 46
positives and 53 negatives. For the conative alternation we had 6 of each. In both cases, we used the
Mann Whitney U test to see if there was a significant relationship between the similarity measure and
participation. We then used a threshold on the similarity scores as the decision point for participation
to determine a level of accuracy. We experimented
with both the mean and median of the scores as a
threshold. Seven of the negative causative candidates were randomly chosen and removed to ensure
an even split between positive and negative candidates for determining accuracy using the mean and
median as thresholds.
The following subsection describes the results of
the experiments using the method described in section 3 above. Subsection 4.2 describes an experiment
on the same data to determine participation using a
similarity measure based on the intersection of the
lemmas at the target slots.

4.1 Using Syntax and Selectional
Preferences
The results for the causative alternation are displayed in table 1 for both the RBC and the UBC. The
relationship between participation and asp is highly
significant in both cases, with values of p well below
0.01. Accuracy for the mean and median thresholds
are displayed in the fourth and fifth columns. Both
thresholds outperform the random baseline of 50%.
The results for the UBC are slightly improved, compared to those for the RBC, however the improvement is not significant.
The numbers of false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) errors for the mean and median thresholds
are displayed in table 2, along with the threshold and
accuracy. The outcomes for each individual verb for
the experiment using the RBC and the mean threshold are as follows:
• True negatives:
add admit answer believe borrow cost declare demand expect feel imagine know notice pay perform practise proclaim read remember sing survive understand win write
• True positives:
accelerate bang bend boil break burn change
close cook cool crack decrease drop dry end expand fly improve increase match melt open ring
rip rock roll shatter shut slam smash snap spill
split spread start stop stretch swing tilt turn
wake
• False negatives:
flood land march repeat terminate
• False positives:
ask attack catch choose climb drink eat help kick
knit miss outline pack paint plan prescribe pull
remain steal suck warn wash
The results for the UBC experiment are very similar.
If the median is used, the number of FPs and FNs
are evenly balanced. This is because the median
threshold is, by definition, taken midway between
the test items arranged in order of their similarity
scores. There are an even number of items on either
side of the decision point, and an even number of
positive and negative candidates in our test sample.
Thus, the errors on either side of the decision point
are equal in number.
For both base cuts, there are a larger number of
false positives than false negatives when the mean
is used. The mean produces a higher accuracy than
the median, but gives an increase in false positives.
Many false positives arise where the preferences at
both target slots are near neighbours in WordNet.
For example, this occurred for eat and drink. There
verbs have a high probability mass (around 0.7) under the entity class in both target slots, since both
people and types of food occur under this class. In
cases like these, the probability distributions at the
RBC, and frequently the UBC, are not sufficiently distinctive.
The polysemy of the verbs may provide another
explanation for the large quantity of false positives.
The scFs and data of different senses should not
ideally be combined, at least not for coarse grained
sense distinctions. We tested the false positive and
true negative candidates to see if there was a relationship between the polysemy of a verb and its
misclassification. The number of senses (according
to WordNet) was used to indicate the polysemy of a
verb. The Mann Whitney U test was performed on

Table 2: Error analysis for the causative experiments
the verbs found to be true negative and false positive
using the RBC. A significant relationship was not
found between participation and misclassification.
Both groups had an average of 5 senses per verb.
This is not to say that distinguishing verb senses
would not improve performance, provided that there
was sufficient data. However, verb polysemy does
not appear to be a major source of error, from our
preliminary analysis. In many cases, such as read
which was classified both by the judges, and the system as a negative candidate, the predominant sense
of the verb provides the majority of the data. Alternate senses, for example, The book reads well, often
do not contribute enough data so as to give rise to
a large proportion of errors. Finding an appropriate
inventory of senses would be difficult, since we would
not wish to separate related senses which occur as
alternate variants of one another. The inventory
would therefore require knowledge of the phenomena
that we are endeavouring to acquire automatically.
To show that our method will work for other RSAS,
we use the conative. Our sample size is rather small
since we are limited by the number of positive candidates in the corpus having sufficient frequency for
both scFs. The sparse data problem is acute when
we look at alternations with specific prepositions. A
sample of 12 verbs (6 positive and 6 negative) remained after the selection process outlined above.
For this small sample we obtained a significant result (p = 0.02) with a mean accuracy of 67% and
a median accuracy of 83%. On this occasion, the
median performed better than the mean. More data
is required to see if this difference is significant.
4.2 Using Syntax and Lemmas
This experiment was conducted using the same data
as that used in the previous subsection. In this experiment, we used a similarity score on the argument
heads directly, instead of generalizing the argument
heads to WordNet classes. The venn diagram in figure 3 shows a subset of the lemmas at the transitive
and intransitive scFs for the verb break.
The lemma based similarity measure is termed
lemma overlap (LO) and is given in equation 3, where
A and B represent the target slots. LO is the size of
the intersection of the multisets of argument heads
at the target slots, divided by the size of the smaller
of the two multisets. The intersection of two multisets includes duplicate items only as many times
as the item is in both sets. For example, if one
slot contained the argument heads (person, person,
person, child, man, spokeswoman), and the other
slot contained {person, person, child, chair, collection}, then the intersection would be {person, person, child}, and LO would be t . This measure ranges
between zero (no overlap) and I (where one set is a
proper subset of that at the other slot).
linultiset intersection(A B)I
Lo(A, B) = (3)
'smallest set(A,
Using the Mann Whitney U test on the LO scores,
we obtained a z score of 2.00. This is significant to
the 95% level, a lower level than that for the classbased experiments. The results using the mean and
median of the LO scores are shown in table 3. Performance is lower than that for the class-based experiments. The outcome for the individual verbs using
the mean as a threshold was:
• True negatives:
add admit answer borrow choose climb cost declare demand drink eat feel imagine notice outline pack paint perform plan practise prescribe
proclaim read remain sing steal suck survive understand wash win write
• True positives:
bend boil burn change close cool dry end fly improve increase match melt open ring roll shut
slam smash start stop tilt wake
• False negatives:
accelerate bang break cook crack decrease drop
expand flood land march repeat rip rock shatter

• False positives:

Interestingly, the errors for the LO measure tend
to be false negatives, rather than false positives. The
LO measure is much more conservative than the approach using the Tcms. In this case the median
threshold produces better results.
For the conative alternation, the lemma based
method does not show a significant relationship between participation and the LO scores. Moreover,
there is no difference between the sums of the ranks
of the two groups for the Mann Whitney U test.
The mean produces an accuracy of 58% whilst the
median produces an accuracy of 50%.
5 Related Work
There has been some recent interest in observing
alternations in corpora (McCarthy and Korhonen,
1998; Lapata, 1999) and predicting related verb
classifications (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999). Earlier work by Resnik (1993) demonstrated a link between selectional preference strength and participation in alternations where the direct object is omitted. Resnik used syntactic information from the
bracketing within the Penn Treebank corpus. Research into the identification of other diathesis alternations has been advanced by the availability
of automatic syntactic processing. Most work using corpus evidence for verb classification has relied on a priori knowledge in the form of linguistic
cues specific to the phenomena being observed (Lapata, 1999; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999). Our approach, whilst being applicable only to RsAs, does
not require human input specific to the alternation
at hand.
Lapata (1999) identifies participation in the dative
and benefactive alternations. Lapata's strategy is to
identify participants using a shallow parser and various linguistic and semantic cues, which are specified
manually for these two alternations. PP attachments
are resolved using Hindle and Rooth's (1993) lexical
association score. Compound nouns, which could be
mistaken for the double object construction, were
filtered using the log-likelihood ratio test. The semantic cues were obtained by manual analysis. The
relative frequency of a SCF for a verb, compared to
the total frequency of the verb, was used for filtering
out erroneous scFs.
Lapata does not report recall and precision figures against a gold standard. The emphasis is on
the phenomena actually evident in the corpus data.
Many of the verbs listed in Levin as taking the alternation were not observed with this alternation
in the corpus data. This amounted to 44% of the
verbs for the benefactive, and 52% for the dative.
These figures only take into account the verbs for
which at least one of the scFs were observed. 54%
of the verbs listed for the dative and benefactive by
Levin were not acquired with either of the target
scFs. Conversely, many verbs not listed in Levin
were identified as taking the benefactive or dative
alternation using Lapata's criteria. Manual analysis
of these verbs revealed 18 false positives out of 52
candidates.
Stevenson and Merlo (1999) use syntactic and lexical cues for classifying 60 verbs in three verb classes:
unergative, unaccusative and verbs with an optional
direct object. These three classes were chosen be

median 0.23 63 17 17
Table 3: Accuracy and error analysis for lemma based experiments
cause a few well defined features, specified a priori, can distinguish the three groups. Twenty verbs
from Levin's classification were used in each class.
They were selected by virtue of having sufficient frequency in a combined corpus (from the Brown and
the wsJ) of 65 million words. The verbs were also
chosen for having one predominant intended sense in
the corpus. Stevenson and Merlo used four linguistically motivated features to distinguish these groups.
Counts from the corpus data for each of the four features were normalised to give a score on a scale of 1
to 100. One feature was the causative non-causative
distinction. For this feature, a measure similar to
our LO measure was used. The four features were
identified in the corpus using automatic POS tagging
and parsing of the data. The data for half of the
verbs in each class was subject to manual scrutiny,
after initial automatic processing. The rest of the
data was produced fully automatically. The verbs
were classified automatically using the four features.
The accuracy of automatic classification was 52% using all four features, compared to a baseline of 33%.
The best result was obtained using a combination of
three features. This gave an accuracy of 66%.
McCarthy and Korhonen (1998) proposed a
method for identifying asAs using MDL. This
method relied on an estimation of the cost of using Tcms to encode the argument head data at a
target slot. The sum of the costs for the two target
slots was compared to the cost of a TCM for encoding
the union of the argument head data over the two
slots. Results are reported for the causative alternation with 15 verbs. This method depends on there
being similar quantities of data at the alternating
slots, otherwise the data at the more frequent slot
overwhelms the data at the less frequent slot. However, many alternations involve scFs with substantially different relative frequencies, especially when
one SCF is specific to a particular preposition. We
carried out some experiments using the MDL method
and our Tcms. For the causative, we used a sample
of 110 verbs and obtained 63% accuracy. For the
conative, a sample of 16 verbs was used and this time
accuracy was only 56%. Notably, only one negative
decision was made because of the disparate frame
frequencies, which reduces the cost of combining the
argument head data.
6 Conclusion
We have discovered a significant relationship between the similarity of selectional preferences at the
target slots, and participation in the causative and
conative alternations. A threshold, such as the mean
or median can be used to obtain a level of accuracy
well above the baseline. A lemma based similarity
score does not always indicate a significant relationship and generally produces a lower accuracy.
There are patterns of diathesis behaviour among
verb groups (Levin, 1993). Accuracy may be improved by considering several alternations collectively, rather than in isolation. Complementary
techniques to identify alternations, for example
(Resnik, 1993), might be combined with ours.
Although we have reported results on only two
RSAS, our method is applicable to other such alternations. Furthermore, such application requires no
human endeavour, apart from that required for evaluation. However, a considerably larger corpus would
be required to overcome the sparse data problem for
other RSA alternations.

We propose a method for identifying diathesis alternations where a particular argument type is seen in slots which have different grammatical roles in the alternating forms. The method uses selectional preferences acquired as probability distributions over WordNet. Preferences for the target slots are compared using a measure of distributional similarity. The method is evaluated on the causative and conative alternations, but is generally applicable and does not require a priori knowledge specific to the alternation.

have been suggested for controlling the application of alternations (Briscoe and Copestake, 1996). We propose a method to acquire knowledge of alternation participation directly from corpora, with frequency information available as a by-product. 3 Method We use both syntactic and semantic information for identifying participants in RsAs. Firstly, syntactic processing is used to find candidates taking the alternating SCFS. Secondly, selectional preference models are acquired for the argument heads associated with a specific slot in a specific SCF of a verb. We use the SCF acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997), with a probabilistic LR parser (Inui et al., 1997) for syntactic processing. The corpus data is POS tagged and lemmatised before the LR parser is applied. Subcategorization patterns are extracted from the parses, these include both the syntactic categories and the argument heads of the constituents. These subcategorization patterns are then classified according to a set of 161 SCF classes. The SCF entries for each verb are then subjected to a statistical filter which removes scFs that have occurred with a frequency less than would be expected by chance. The resulting SCF lexicon lists each v

We used the causative and conative alternations, since these have enough candidates in our lexicon for experimentation. Evaluation is performed on verbs already filtered by the syntactic processing. The SCF acquisition system has been evaluated elsewhere (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997). We selected candidate verbs which occurred with 10 or more nominal argument heads at the target slots. The argument heads were restricted to those which can be classified in the WordNet hypernym hierarchy. Candidates were selected by hand so as to obtain an even split between candidates which did participate in the alternation (positive candidates) and those which did not (negative candidates). Four human judges were used to determine the &quot;gold standard&quot;. The judges were asked to specify a yes or no decision on participation for each verb. They were also permitted a don't know verdict. The k

The probability estimate for a hypernym class is obtained by combining the probability estimates for all its hyponyms on the original cut. Figure 2 exemplifies this process for two Tcms (Tcml and Tcm2) in an imaginary hierarchy. The UBC is at the classes B, C and D. To quantify the similarity between the probability distributions for the target slots we use the a-skew divergence (asp) proposed by Lee (1999). 1 This measure, defined in equation 2, is a smoothed version of the Kulback-Liebler divergence. p1(x) and p2(x) are the two probability distributions which are being compared.

mantic relationship with the predicate. Different diathesis alternations give different emphasis and nuances of meaning to the same basic content. These subtle changes of meaning are important in natural language generation (Stede, 1998). Alternations provide a means of reducing redundancy in the lexicon since the alternating scFs need not be enumerated for each individual verb if a marker is used to specify which verbs the alternation applies to. Alternations also provide a means of generalizing patterns of behaviour over groups of verbs, typically the group members are semantically related. Levin (1993) provides a classification of over 3000 verbs according to their participation in alternations involving NP and PP constituents. Levin's classification is not intended to be exhaustive. Automatic identification of alternations would be a useful tool for extending the classification with new participants. Levin's taxonomy might also be used alongside observed behaviour, to predict unseen behaviour. Levin's classification has been extended by other NLP researchers (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dang et al., 256 <Root> Figure 1: TCM for the object slot of the transitive frame of start. \0.2 0.2_ _ _ _ _ 
on was made because of the disparate frame frequencies, which reduces the cost of combining the argument head data. 6 Conclusion We have discovered a significant relationship between the similarity of selectional preferences at the target slots, and participation in the causative and conative alternations. A threshold, such as the mean or median can be used to obtain a level of accuracy well above the baseline. A lemma based similarity score does not always indicate a significant relationship and generally produces a lower accuracy. There are patterns of diathesis behaviour among verb groups (Levin, 1993). Accuracy may be improved by considering several alternations collectively, rather than in isolation. Complementary techniques to identify alternations, for example (Resnik, 1993), might be combined with ours. Although we have reported results on only two RSAS, our method is applicable to other such alternations. Furthermore, such application requires no human endeavour, apart from that required for evaluation. However, a considerably larger corpus would be required to overcome the sparse data problem for other RSA alternations. 7 Acknowledgements Some funding for this work was provided by UK

Selectional preferences are automatically acquired for the slots involved in the role switching. We refer to these as the target slots. For the causative alternation, the slots are the direct object slot of the transitive SCF and the subject slot of the intransitive. For the conative, the slots are the direct object of the transitive and the PP of the up v pp SCF. Selectional preferences are acquired using the method devised by Li and Abe (1995). The preferences for a slot are represented as a tree cut model (Tcm). This is a set of disjoint classes that partition the leaves of the WordNet noun hypernym hierarchy. A conditional probability is attached to each of the classes in the set. To ensure the TCM covers all the word senses in WordNet, we modify Li and Abe's original scheme by creating hyponym leaf classes below all WordNet's hypernym (internal) classes. Each leaf holds the word senses previously held at the internal class. The nominal argument heads from a target slot are collected and used to populate the WordNet hierarchy wit

The data for half of the verbs in each class was subject to manual scrutiny, after initial automatic processing. The rest of the data was produced fully automatically. The verbs were classified automatically using the four features. The accuracy of automatic classification was 52% using all four features, compared to a baseline of 33%. The best result was obtained using a combination of three features. This gave an accuracy of 66%. McCarthy and Korhonen (1998) proposed a method for identifying asAs using MDL. This method relied on an estimation of the cost of using Tcms to encode the argument head data at a target slot. The sum of the costs for the two target slots was compared to the cost of a TCM for encoding the union of the argument head data over the two slots. Results are reported for the causative alternation with 15 verbs. This method depends on there being similar quantities of data at the alternating slots, otherwise the data at the more frequent slot overwhelms the data at the less frequent slot.

Where a lemma appears as a synonym in more than one class, its frequency count is divided between all classes for which it has direct membership.

 (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987). And Ribas (1995) showed that selectional preferences acquired using alternations performed better on a word sense disambiguation task compared to preferences acquired without alternations. He used alternations to indicate where the argument head data from different slots can be combined since it occupies the same semantic relationship with the predicate. Different diathesis alternations give different emphasis and nuances of meaning to the same basic content. These subtle changes of meaning are important in natural language generation (Stede, 1998). Alternations provide a means of reducing redundancy in the lexicon since the alternating scFs need not be enumerated for each individual verb if a marker is used to specify which verbs the alternation applies to. Alternations also provide a means of generalizing patterns of behaviour over groups of verbs, typically the group members are semantically related. Levin (1993) provides a classification of over 3000 verbs according to their participation in alternations involving NP and PP constituents. Levin's classification is not intended to be exhaustive.

prepositional phrase construction involving either at or on. An example of the conative alternation is given in (2). 1. The boy broke the window The window broke. 2. The boy pulled at the rope The boy pulled the rope. We refer to alternations where a particular semantic role appears in different grammatical roles in alternate realisations as &quot;role switching alternations&quot; (RsAs). It is these alternations that our method applies to. Recently, there has been interest in corpus-based methods to identify alternations (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999), and associated verb classifications (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999). These have either relied on a priori knowledge specified for the alternations in advance, or are not suitable for a wide range of alternations. The fully automatic method outlined here is applied to the causative and conative alternations, but is applicable to other RSAS. 2 Motivation Diathesis alternations have been proposed for a number of NLP tasks. Several researchers have suggested using them for improving lexical acquisition. Korhonen (1997) uses them in subcategorization frame (scF) acquisition to improve the performance of a statistical filter which determines whether a SCF observed 
 than the approach using the Tcms. In this case the median threshold produces better results. For the conative alternation, the lemma based method does not show a significant relationship between participation and the LO scores. Moreover, there is no difference between the sums of the ranks of the two groups for the Mann Whitney U test. The mean produces an accuracy of 58% whilst the median produces an accuracy of 50%. 5 Related Work There has been some recent interest in observing alternations in corpora (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999) and predicting related verb classifications (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999). Earlier work by Resnik (1993) demonstrated a link between selectional preference strength and participation in alternations where the direct object is omitted. Resnik used syntactic information from the bracketing within the Penn Treebank corpus. Research into the identification of other diathesis alternations has been advanced by the availability of automatic syntactic processing. Most work using corpus evidence for verb classification has relied on a priori knowledge in the form of linguistic cues specific to the phenomena being observed (Lapata, 1999; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999). Our appro
d in Levin as taking the alternation were not observed with this alternation in the corpus data. This amounted to 44% of the verbs for the benefactive, and 52% for the dative. These figures only take into account the verbs for which at least one of the scFs were observed. 54% of the verbs listed for the dative and benefactive by Levin were not acquired with either of the target scFs. Conversely, many verbs not listed in Levin were identified as taking the benefactive or dative alternation using Lapata's criteria. Manual analysis of these verbs revealed 18 false positives out of 52 candidates. Stevenson and Merlo (1999) use syntactic and lexical cues for classifying 60 verbs in three verb classes: unergative, unaccusative and verbs with an optional direct object. These three classes were chosen be261 threshold type threshold accuracy % num FPS num FNS mean 0.26 60 14 23 median 0.23 63 17 17 Table 3: Accuracy and error analysis for lemma based experiments cause a few well defined features, specified a priori, can distinguish the three groups.
