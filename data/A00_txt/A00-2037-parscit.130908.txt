Abstract
Acknowledgments are relatively rare in humancomputer interaction. Are people unwilling to use
this human convention when talking to a machine,
or is their scarcity due to the way that spoken-language interfaces are designed? We found that,
given a simple spoken-language interface that provided opportunities for and responded to acknowledgments, about half of our subjects used
acknowledgments at least once and nearly 30%
used them extensively during the interaction.
1 Introduction
As our ability to build robust and flexible spokenlanguage interfaces increases, it is worthwhile to
ask to what extent we should incorporate various
human-human discourse phenomena into our dialogue models. Many studies have shown that people alter their dialogue techniques when they
believe that they are talking to a computer (e.g.,
Brennan, 1991), so it is not clear that observations
of human-human conversation will provide us with
the guidance we need. At the same time, we cannot
always look to current systems to determine which
discourse phenomena should be supported. Current-generation interfaces are still relatively fragile,
and so designers of spoken-language systems go to
some effort to structure dialogues and create
prompts that guide the user toward short, contentful, in-vocabulary responses (e.g., Basson et at,
1996; Cole, et al, 1997; Oviatt et al, 1994). One
result of this approach is the suppression of metadialogue acts such as acknowledgement and repetition.
The term &quot;acknowledgment&quot; is from Clark and
Schaefer (1989), who describe a hierarchy of methods by which one conversant may signal that
another's contribution has been understood well
enough to allow the conversation to proceed.
Acknowledgments often appear in American
English conversation as an &quot;okay&quot; or &quot;uh-huh&quot; that
signals understanding but not necessarily agreement. These are also called &quot;back channels&quot; or
&quot;prompts&quot; (e.g., Chu-Carroll & Brown, 1997),
Closely related to acknowledgments are repetitions, in which the conversant provides a stronger
signal that a contribution has been understood by
repeating part or all of the other's contribution.
Repetitions are also referred to as &quot;paraphrases&quot;
(Traum & Heeman, 1996), &quot;echoing&quot; (Swerts et at,
1998), and &quot;demonstration&quot; (Clark & Schaefer,
1989). Repetitions are often seen when one is conveying complex information, such as when one
copies an address or telephone number.
Neither acknowledgments nor repetitions contribute new domain information to the conversation, but they serve to assure the speaker that
information has been conveyed successfully.
Acknowledgments also play a role in managing
turn-taking in mixed-initiative dialogue; although
acknowledgments may preface a new contribution
by the same speaker (Novick & Sutton, 1994),
often they occur alone as a single-phrase turn that
appears to serve the purpose of explicitly declining
an opportunity to take a turn (Sacks et al, 1974).
Acknowledgments and repetitions are ubiquitous in many types of human-human conversation.
In a corpus of problem-solving spoken dialogues,
for example, Traum and Heeman (1996) found that
51% of turns began with or consisted of an explicit
acknowledgment. Given this, one would expect
that acknowledgments should be modeled in dialogue models for spoken-language systems, and
280
indeed some research models are beginning to
incorporate acknowledgments, e.g., Kita et al
(1996), Aist, (1998), Iwase & Ward (1998).
Typical human-computer dialogue models are
structured in ways that suppress the use of
acknowledgments. In many systems turn-taking is
completely controlled by one conversant, e.g., the
user responds to system prompts, which tends to
eliminate the need for acknowledgments as a turntaking mechanism. In other systems, the use of
barge-in defeats the common interpretation of an
acknowledgment; if the user speaks, the system
contribution is cut off before the user utterance is
interpreted. If that utterance was intended to signal
that the contribution should continue, the effect is
exactly the opposite of the one desired.
Thus, current design practices both discourage
and render meaningless the standard uses of
acknowledgments. If these impediments were
removed, would people choose to use acknowledgments when interacting with a computer interface?
2 Experiment
This study was designed as a pilot to our larger
investigation into the effects of incorporating
acknowledgement behavior in dialogue models for
spoken-language interfaces. Before we attempted
to compare interfaces with and without acknowledgement behavior, we wanted to understand
whether people are willing to use this sort of metadialogue behavior when interacting with a computer.
2.1 Approach
In this study we hypothesized that subjects will
choose to use acknowledgments in human-computer interaction if they are given an interface that
provides opportunities for and responds to
acknowledgments.
In designing the study, we assumed that it
would not immediately occur to subjects that they
could use acknowledgments to a computer. At the
same time, we did not want to explicitly instruct or
require subjects to use acknowledgment behavior,
as that would tell us nothing about their preferences. We therefore decided against a comparison/
control-group experimental design for this initial
study and instead focused on creating a situation in
which subjects would have a reason to use
acknowledgments, perhaps even gain an advantage
from doing so, while still keeping the behavior
optional.
We decided to focus on a somewhat narrow use
of acknowledgments. Conversants are especially
likely to offer acknowledgments and repetitions
when complex information is being presented,
especially when the conversant is copying the
information. While this is certainly explainable in
terms of mutuality of understanding, this particular
use of acknowledgment may be viewed from a
more mechanical standpoint as regulating the pace
at which information is presented. This insight suggested to us that a fruitful task for this study might
be one in which the subject is asked to write down
verbally-presented information, as when taking
messages over the telephone.
2.2 Task
We selected the domain of telephone interface to
email and designed a task in which subjects were
asked to transcribe items of information from the
messages. Writing is slow in comparison to speaking, so we anticipated that subjects would require a
slower pace of information presentation when they
were writing. The messages included information
not asked for on the question list to simulate &quot;uninteresting&quot; material that the subject would want to
move through at a faster pace. In this way we
hoped to motivate subjects to try to control the
pace at which information was presented.
The email was presented in segments roughly
corresponding to a long phrase. After each segment, the system paused to give the subject time to
make notes. If the subject said nothing, the system
would continue by presenting the next message
segment. Subjects could accept--and perhaps
make use ofâ€”this delay, or they could reduce it by
acknowledging the contribution, e.g., &quot;okay,&quot; or by
commanding the system to continue, e.g., &quot;go on.&quot;
The system signalled the possibility of controlling
the delay by prompting the subject &quot;Are you ready
to go on?&quot; after the first pause. This prompting was
repeated for every third pause in which the subject
said nothing. In this way we hoped to suggest to
the subjects that they could control the wait time if
desired without explicitly telling them how to do
SO.
On the surface, there is no functional difference in system behavior between a subject's use of
281
a command to move the system onward (e.g., &quot;go
on,&quot; &quot;next&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;) and the use of an acknowledgment (&quot;okay,&quot; &quot;uh-huh&quot;, or a repetition). In
either case, the system responds by presenting the
next message segment, and in fact it eventually
presents the next segment even if the subject says
nothing at all. Thus, the design allows the subject
to choose freely between accepting the system's
pace (system initiative), or commanding the system
to continue (user initiative), or acknowledging the
presentations in a fashion more typical of mixedinitiative human conversation. In this way, we
hoped to understand how the subject preferred to
interact with the computer.
2.3 Subjects
Subjects were told that the study's purpose was to
assess the understandability and usability of the
interface, and that their task was to find the
answers to a list of questions. They were given no
instructions in the use of the program beyond the
information that they could talk to it using normal,
everyday speech.
The 14 volunteers were native speakers of
North American English, and most were staff at a
research university. Ten were female, four were
male. Ages ranged from 13 to 57. All used computers, typically office software and games, but none
had significant programming experience. Each session lasted about 45 minutes total, and each subject
was paid $10.00. One subject declined payment.
2.4 Interface
As mentioned earlier, one difficulty with recognizing acknowledgements in spoken-language interfaces is that the use of barge-in tends to defeat the
purpose of acknowledgments when they occur in
overlapped speech. We used a Wizard of Oz protocol as a simple way to allow the system to respond
to such utterances and to provide robustness in
handling repetitions.
The wizard's interface was constructed using
the Rapid Application Developer in the Center for
Spoken Language Understanding Toolkit (Sutton,
et al, 1998). A simple button panel allowed the
wizard to select the appropriate response from the
actions supported by the application. The application functionality was deliberately limited to suggest realistic abilities for a current spokenlanguage interface. Using messages pre-recorded
in a synthesized voice, the wizard was able to
direct the system to:
â€¢ Read a list of all messages.
â€¢ Begin reading a particular message.
â€¢ Read the next message segment.
â€¢ Repeat the current message segment.
â€¢ Repeat the previous message segment.
â€¢ Ask the subject whether the program should
continue reading the current message.
â€¢ Ask the subject to what to do next.
â€¢ End the program.
â€¢ Play one of several error and help messages.
The texts of the email messages were presented in phrases of varying lengths, with each
phrase followed by a pause of about five seconds.
Preliminary tests showed that the combined
response time of the wizard and the interface was
between one and two seconds, and that pauses of
less than five seconds were not obviously different
from the normal pace of system response. Five seconds is a long response time, uncomfortably so for
human-human conversation, so we hoped that this
lengthy pause would encourage the subjects to take
the initiative in controlling the pace of the interaction.
The messages were divided into segments by
hand. The divisions were intended to simulate a
phrase-level presentation, although some short
phrases were combined to make the presentation
less choppy. An example of one message and its
division into phrases may be seen in Figure 1.
Synthesized speech from the Festival speech
synthesizer (Taylor, et al, 1998) was used throughout the interface. The message texts were presented
in a synthesized male voice, while the control portions of the interface used a synthesized female
voice. Default pronunciations were used except
when the default was incorrect, e.g., &quot;read&quot;
defaulted to the past-tense pronunciation in all contexts. Also, there was minor use of the SABLE
markup language (Wouters, et al, 1999) to flatten
the pitch range at the end of phrases in list items;
the intent was to suggest the prosody of list continuation rather than the default sentence-final drop.

To improve the understandability, both voices were
slowed slightly to 90% of the default speaking rate.
2.5 Measures
The central question to be answered is: will the
subject use acknowledgments in interacting with
the program? A subject can show one of several
patterns of response:
â€¢ The subject may make no attempt to control the
pacing of the interface, instead allowing the
interaction to proceed via time-outs.
â€¢ The subject may use only commands to control
the pacing.
â€¢ The subject may use only acknowledgments to
control the pacing.
â€¢ The subject may use a mixture of commands and
acknowledgments.
The determination as to whether a particular utterance constituted an acknowledgment or a command was based primarily on word choice and
dialogue context; this approach is consistent with
definitions of this behavior, e.g., Chu-Carroll and
Brown (1997). For example, &quot;yes&quot; in the context of
a system inform (a segment of an email message)
was considered an acknowledgment, but &quot;yes&quot; in
the context of a system question was not. The
words &quot;okay,&quot; &quot;uh-huh,&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; (immediately
following an inform) were taken as evidence of
acknowledgments, and phrases such as &quot;go on,&quot;
&quot;continue,&quot; &quot;next&quot; following an inform were taken
as evidence of commands. The interpretation was
confirmed during the post-experiment interview by
questioning the subjects about their word choice.
2.6 Post-Experiment Interview
A post-experiment interview was conducted to
gather subject feedback and to answer subjects'
questions. The experimenter took notes and thus
could have introduced bias in the record of
responses. No tape recording was made.
The subject was first invited to comment on the
interface and the interaction in an open-ended fashion. When the subject had finished, the experimenter asked several specific questions to assess
their understanding of the interface functionality.
During this time, the experimenter reminded the
subjects of the words that they had used most frequently to prompt the system to continue during
pauses and asked the subjects why they had
selected those words.
Finally, the experimenter explained the true
purpose and hypothesis of the experiment, verified
that the subject was unaware that they had been
interacting with a Wizard-of-Oz interface, and
asked the subject to comment on the notion of
using acknowledgments when interacting with a
computer. The responses to this question, especially, must be assumed to be somewhat optimistic,
as it is likely that at least some subjects would be
reluctant to disagree with the experimenter,

this pilot study, no tests of statistical significance of
differences in the rates of acknowledgment behavior were made.
Eight of the fourteen subjects used an
acknowledgment or repetition at least once, and
four used acknowledgment/repetitions more frequently than they used commands. Only one subject used acknowledgments exclusively, while five
subjects never used acknowledgments. No subject
relied exclusively on time-outs to allow the system
to proceed at its own pace, although one subject
did use that as her predominant method (42 times,
while using acknowledgments only six times and
commands three times). Only one subject used repetition, and he reported during the interview that he
was unaware of having done so.
It is interesting to note that while all of the
male subjects in this sample exhibited acknowledgment behavior at least once, only one preferred
acknowledgment over command. One of the male
subjects used acknowledgments only three times,
in all cases as prefaces to commands. Conversely,
although a lower percentage of women used
acknowledgments (40%), a higher percentage of
them (30%) used acknowledgments in preference
to commands. Because of the small numbers of
subjects, however, we do not conclude that these
differences are significant.
During the post-experiment interview, two subjects (both female) described the idea of using
acknowledgments to the computer as strange and
stated that they didn't feel that they would do this
unless directed toâ€”and even then, they would
regard it as simply an alternate command. Two
other subjects, both females who had used
acknowledgments 2-6 times during the task, each
reported that she had felt silly when she had caught
herself saying &quot;please&quot; and &quot;okay&quot; to a computer
but had been pleased when it had worked. The
remainder of the subjects either expressed no
strong opinion (two, both female) or expressed a
positive attitude toward being able to use acknowledgments when interacting with a computer. Two
subjects who had not used acknowledgments commented that they would probably be more likely to
use human-like conversation if the synthesized
voice were more human-like.
Again, this report of the subjects' attitudes
should be interpreted with caution; at this point in
the interview they knew the experimenter's hypothesis and so may have been reluctant to disagree.
3.1 Other Dialogue Behaviors
Although we had not formed any hypothesis about
other dialogue behaviors, we noticed several interesting dialogue behaviors that we had not anticipated.
We were surprised at the number of subjects
who exhibited politeness behavior toward the interface, either saying &quot;please&quot; when issuing commands to the computer or responding to the
program's &quot;good-bye&quot; at the end of the session.
One subject used &quot;please&quot; throughout the interaction, but a more common pattern was to use
&quot;please&quot; at the beginning of the session and to drop
the behavior as the interface became more familiar.
Politeness did not seem to be strongly associated
with a willingness to use acknowledgments, however; four of the nine subjects who exhibited
politeness did not use any acknowledgments in
their interaction.
Despite the deliberately-artificial interface,
several subjects responded at least once to the message content as if they were talking to the message
284

sender. In the excerpt shown in Figure 2., for example, the subject replied &quot;Thank you&quot; to the message
text's &quot;thank you.&quot; This did not appear to be a matter of misunderstanding the capabilities of the
interface; the subject later reported that despite the
synthesized voices she had briefly forgotten that
she wasn't talking to her secretary.
Three subjects also made one or more metacomments, e.g., &quot;oh, there it is&quot; when finding a particular piece of information. These may have been
at least partially an artifact of the &quot;treasure hunt&quot;
nature of the task. When questioned in the postexperiment interview, subjects didn't seem aware
that they'd made these comments. All but one of
these instances were followed immediately by a
command, so the wizard responded to the command and ignored the meta-comment. The one
stand-alone meta-comment was treated as an
unrecognized command (an error message was
played).
4 Discussion
Subjects were provided with three methods for
controlling the pace at which information was presented: silence, command, or acknowledgment/
repetition. The majority of the subjects used commands more than they used acknowledgments, but
over one half used an acknowledgment or repetition at least once during their interaction and
nearly 30% used acknowledgments in preference
to commands. This occurred despite the fact that
subjects were given no reason to think that this
behavior would be effective: the interface was
deliberately limited in functionality, and voice synthesis was used instead of recorded voice to
emphasize the artificial nature of the interaction.
Furthermore, the interface did not offer acknowledgments to the subjects, and the subjects were
given no instructions suggesting that the interface
understood acknowledgments. In fact two subjects
who did use acknowledgments expressed surprise
that they had worked, and two who had not used
acknowledgments reported that they would probably have used them if they had known it would
work.
It is interesting to consider these results in light
of those reported by Okato et al (1998). They
describe a Japanese-language Wizard-of-Oz study
in which the subjects were given some instruction
on using the system, and in which the system both
presented and accepted back-channel feedback.
They found that even when the interface offered
back channels itself the rate of subject back-channels was somewhat lower in human-computer
interaction than in comparable human-human conversation. This makes the fact that our interface
elicited acknowledgments without offering them
even more encouraging. Clearly, some people are
willing to utilize this human conversational convention in human-computer dialogue. Our postexperiment interviews suggest, however, that some
people will find the use of acknowledgements
strange or uncomfortable in human-computer interaction. While self-reports of attitudes toward hypothetical situations must be treated with some
caution, it seems reasonable to assume that even
when such interfaces become available there will
be users who will prefer to interact with computers
using commands.
Will attitudes and conversational behavior
change as people gain experience with more
advanced spoken-language interfaces? Despite the
285
relatively short duration of this testâ€”most subjects
completed the task itself in 15-20 minutesâ€”some
changes in behavior could be observed over the
course of the dialogue. In particular, politeness
behaviors were likely to be seen early in the dialogues and then diminish as the subjects became
more comfortable with their interaction. We speculate that the use of politeness words did not reflect
a strong underlying politeness toward the computer
so much as a falling back on human conventions
when faced with an unfamiliar dialogue situation.
One subject who had used &quot;please&quot; 21 times during the interaction, for example, simply hung up
without warning when she had finished. This contrasts, however, with the findings of Nass et al
(1999) that people do offer socially-desirable
behavior to computers.
Would a better voice increase the incidence of
acknowledgment behavior? Several subjects
thought it would, and even with the current synthesized voices we saw several examples of subjects
seemingly forgetting briefly that they were not
talking to a human. We plan to explore this question in future work.
4.1 Conclusions and Future Work
We conducted a preliminary study to examine the
willingness of subjects to use a particular dialogue
act, acknowledgment, in human-computer interaction. Although the number of subjects was small,
we saw that about half of our subjects used
acknowledgements or repetition at least occasionally to control the pace at which information was
presented, and about 29% used acknowledgments
more frequently than they used commands for that
purpose.
Our immediate plans include extending this
study to a larger and gender-balanced group of subjects so that we can draw firmer quantitative conclusions about the percentage of people who are
likely to prefer this style of interaction. In particular, we cannot conclude from the current study's
small sample how strong the preference for using
acknowledgment might be, especially among male
subjects. Also, in our current study the subject
achieved no functional benefit in using acknowledgments. With better estimates of subject preferences, we can then proceed to our larger goal of
comparing the usefulness and user acceptability of
spoken language dialogue models with and without
acknowledgment behavior (c.f. Walker, 1993). We
also plan to explore the effect of the quality of the
synthesized voice on the incidence of acknowledgment behavior.

d? We found that, given a simple spoken-language interface that provided opportunities for and responded to acknowledgments, about half of our subjects used acknowledgments at least once and nearly 30% used them extensively during the interaction. 1 Introduction As our ability to build robust and flexible spokenlanguage interfaces increases, it is worthwhile to ask to what extent we should incorporate various human-human discourse phenomena into our dialogue models. Many studies have shown that people alter their dialogue techniques when they believe that they are talking to a computer (e.g., Brennan, 1991), so it is not clear that observations of human-human conversation will provide us with the guidance we need. At the same time, we cannot always look to current systems to determine which discourse phenomena should be supported. Current-generation interfaces are still relatively fragile, and so designers of spoken-language systems go to some effort to structure dialogues and create prompts that guide the user toward short, contentful, in-vocabulary responses (e.g., Basson et at, 1996; Cole, et al, 1997; Oviatt et al, 1994). One result of this approach is the suppression of metadialogue acts su

ubject can show one of several patterns of response: â€¢ The subject may make no attempt to control the pacing of the interface, instead allowing the interaction to proceed via time-outs. â€¢ The subject may use only commands to control the pacing. â€¢ The subject may use only acknowledgments to control the pacing. â€¢ The subject may use a mixture of commands and acknowledgments. The determination as to whether a particular utterance constituted an acknowledgment or a command was based primarily on word choice and dialogue context; this approach is consistent with definitions of this behavior, e.g., Chu-Carroll and Brown (1997). For example, &quot;yes&quot; in the context of a system inform (a segment of an email message) was considered an acknowledgment, but &quot;yes&quot; in the context of a system question was not. The words &quot;okay,&quot; &quot;uh-huh,&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; (immediately following an inform) were taken as evidence of acknowledgments, and phrases such as &quot;go on,&quot; &quot;continue,&quot; &quot;next&quot; following an inform were taken as evidence of commands. The interpretation was confirmed during the post-experiment interview by questioning the subjects about their word choice. 2.6 Post-Experiment Interview A post-experiment interview was conducted to gather

The term &quot;acknowledgment&quot; is from Clark and Schaefer (1989), who describe a hierarchy of methods by which one conversant may signal that another's contribution has been understood well enough to allow the conversation to proceed. Acknowledgments often appear in American English conversation as an &quot;okay&quot; or &quot;uh-huh&quot; that signals understanding but not necessarily agreement. These are also called &quot;back channels&quot; or &quot;prompts&quot; (e.g., Chu-Carroll & Brown, 1997), Closely related to acknowledgments are repetitions, in which the conversant provides a stronger signal that a contribution has been understood by repeating part or all of the other's contribution. Repetitions are also referred to as &quot;paraphrases&quot; (Traum & Heeman, 1996), &quot;echoing&quot; (Swerts et at, 1998), and &quot;demonstration&quot; (Clark & Schaefer, 1989). Repetitions are often seen when one is conveying complex information, such as when one copies an address or telephone number.

In a corpus of problem-solving spoken dialogues, for example, Traum and Heeman (1996) found that 51% of turns began with or consisted of an explicit acknowledgment.

Typical human-computer dialogue models are structured in ways that suppress the use of acknowledgments. In many systems turn-taking is completely controlled by one conversant, e.g., the user responds to system prompts, which tends to eliminate the need for acknowledgments as a turntaking mechanism. In other systems, the use of barge-in defeats the common interpretation of an acknowledgment; if the user speaks, the system contribution is cut off before the user utterance is interpreted.

 be observed over the course of the dialogue. In particular, politeness behaviors were likely to be seen early in the dialogues and then diminish as the subjects became more comfortable with their interaction. We speculate that the use of politeness words did not reflect a strong underlying politeness toward the computer so much as a falling back on human conventions when faced with an unfamiliar dialogue situation. One subject who had used &quot;please&quot; 21 times during the interaction, for example, simply hung up without warning when she had finished. This contrasts, however, with the findings of Nass et al (1999) that people do offer socially-desirable behavior to computers. Would a better voice increase the incidence of acknowledgment behavior? Several subjects thought it would, and even with the current synthesized voices we saw several examples of subjects seemingly forgetting briefly that they were not talking to a human. We plan to explore this question in future work. 4.1 Conclusions and Future Work We conducted a preliminary study to examine the willingness of subjects to use a particular dialogue act, acknowledgment, in human-computer interaction. Although the number of subjects was small, we

 limited in functionality, and voice synthesis was used instead of recorded voice to emphasize the artificial nature of the interaction. Furthermore, the interface did not offer acknowledgments to the subjects, and the subjects were given no instructions suggesting that the interface understood acknowledgments. In fact two subjects who did use acknowledgments expressed surprise that they had worked, and two who had not used acknowledgments reported that they would probably have used them if they had known it would work. It is interesting to consider these results in light of those reported by Okato et al (1998). They describe a Japanese-language Wizard-of-Oz study in which the subjects were given some instruction on using the system, and in which the system both presented and accepted back-channel feedback. They found that even when the interface offered back channels itself the rate of subject back-channels was somewhat lower in human-computer interaction than in comparable human-human conversation. This makes the fact that our interface elicited acknowledgments without offering them even more encouraging. Clearly, some people are willing to utilize this human conversational convention in human-com

erent from the normal pace of system response. Five seconds is a long response time, uncomfortably so for human-human conversation, so we hoped that this lengthy pause would encourage the subjects to take the initiative in controlling the pace of the interaction. The messages were divided into segments by hand. The divisions were intended to simulate a phrase-level presentation, although some short phrases were combined to make the presentation less choppy. An example of one message and its division into phrases may be seen in Figure 1. Synthesized speech from the Festival speech synthesizer (Taylor, et al, 1998) was used throughout the interface. The message texts were presented in a synthesized male voice, while the control portions of the interface used a synthesized female voice. Default pronunciations were used except when the default was incorrect, e.g., &quot;read&quot; defaulted to the past-tense pronunciation in all contexts. Also, there was minor use of the SABLE markup language (Wouters, et al, 1999) to flatten the pitch range at the end of phrases in list items; the intent was to suggest the prosody of list continuation rather than the default sentence-final drop. 282 Message six is from Jo at telep
