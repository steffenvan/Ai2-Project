Abstract
In this paper, we describe an empirical evaluation of an
adaptive mixed initiative spoken dialogue system. We
conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate the mixed
initiative and automatic adaptation aspects of the system,
and analyzed the resulting dialogues along three dimensions: performance factors, discourse features, and initiative distribution. Our results show that 1) both the
mixed initiative and automatic adaptation aspects led
to better system performance in terms of user satisfaction and dialogue efficiency, and 2) the system's adaptation behavior better matched user expectations, more
efficiently resolved dialogue anomalies, and resulted in
higher overall dialogue quality.
1 Introduction
Recent advances in speech technologies have enabled
spoken dialogue systems to employ mixed initiative dialogue strategies (e.g. (Allen et al., 1996; Sadek et al.,
1996; Meng et al., 1996)). Although these systems interact with users in a manner more similar to human-human
interactions than earlier systems employing system initiative strategies, their response strategies are typically
selected using only local dialogue context, disregarding
dialogue history. Therefore, their gain in naturalness and
performance under optimal conditions is often overshadowed by their inability to cope with anomalies in dialogues by automatically adapting dialogue strategies. In
contrast, Figure 1 shows a dialogue in which the system automatically adapts dialogue strategies based on
the current user utterance and dialogue history.1 After failing to obtain a valid response to an informationseeking query in utterance (4), the system adapted dialogue strategies to provide additional information in (6)
that assisted the user in responding to the query. Furthermore, after the user responded to a limited system prompt
in (10) with a fully-specified query in (11), implicitly
indicating her intention to take charge of the problem

solving process, the system again adapted strategies,
hence providing an open-ended prompt in (13).
Previous work has shown that dialogue systems in
which users can explicitly change the system's dialogue strategies result in better performance than nonadaptable systems (Litman and Pan, 1999). However,
no earlier system allowed for initiative-oriented automatic strategy adaptation based on information dynamically extracted from the user's spoken input. In this
paper, we briefly introduce MIMIC, a mixed initiative
spoken dialogue system that automatically adapts dialogue strategies. We then describe two experiments that
evaluated the effectiveness of MIMIC's mixed initiative
and automatic adaptation capabilities. Our results show
that, when analyzed along the performance dimension,
MIMIC's mixed initiative and automatic adaptation features lead to more efficient dialogues and higher user satisfaction. Moreover, when analyzed along the discourse
and initiative dimensions, MIMIC's adaptation capabilities result in dialogues in which system behavior better
matches user expectations and dialogue anomalies are resolved more efficiently.
2 MIMIC: An Adaptive Mixed Initiative
Dialogue System
MIMIC is a voice-enabled, telephone-based dialogue
system that provides movie showtime information. Two
main features distinguish MIMIC from other existing
spoken dialogue systems. First, MIMIC automatically
adapts dialogue strategies based on dialogue characteristics and thus tailors its behavior to the dialogue context. Second, MIMIC's initiative module is decoupled
from the dialogue manager's goal and strategy selection
processes, thereby enabling the system's adaptation behavior to be easily modified. We outline characteristics
of MIMIC relevant to our experiments and analyses. For
further details about the system, see (Chu-Carroll, 2000).
2.1 Adaptation of Dialogue Strategies
Figure 1 showed an actual interaction between MIMIC
and a user. The task and dialogue initiative holders
annotated for each system turn are the factors that affect MIMIC's dialogue strategy adaptation. Following

Figure 1: An Adaptive Mixed Initiative Dialogue with MIMIC
lead in the process toward achieving the dialogue participants' domain goal, while dialogue initiative models the
lead in determining the current discourse focus. In our
information query application domain, MIMIC has task
(and thus dialogue) initiative when its utterances are intended to provide helpful guidance toward achieving the
user's domain goal, while it has dialogue but not task
initiative if its utterances only specify the current discourse goal.2 For example, as a result of MIMIC taking
over task initiative in (6), helpful guidance, in the form
of valid response choices, was provided in its attempt
to obtain a theater name after the user failed to answer
an earlier question intended to solicit this information.
In (4), MIMIC specified the current discourse goal (requesting information about a missing theater) but did not
suggest valid response choices since it only had dialogue
initiative.
MIMIC's ability to automatically adapt dialogue
strategies is achieved by employing an initiative module that determines initiative distribution based on participant roles, cues detected during the current user utterance, and dialogue history (Chu-Carroll and Brown,
1998). This initiative framework utilizes the DempsterShafer theory (Shafer, 1976; Gordon and Shortliffe,
1984), and represents the current initiative distribution as
two basic probability assignments (bpas) that signify the
overall amount of evidence supporting each agent having task and dialogue initiatives. The effects that a cue
has on changing the current task and dialogue initiative
distribution are also represented as bpas, obtained using
an iterative training procedure on a corpus of transcribed
2In the dialogues collected in our experiments, which are described
in Section 3, there are system turns in which MIMIC had neither task
nor dialogue initiative. However, such cases are rare in this domain and
will not be discussed in this paper.
and annotated human-human dialogues. At the end of
each user turn, the bpas representing the effects of cues
detected during that turn are combined with the bpas representing the current initiative distribution to obtain the
initiative distribution for the system's next turn.
In Figure 1, utterance (3) triggered the cue AmbiguousAction since the town of Montclair has multiple theaters. Although AmbiguousAction contributed to the system having both initiatives in the next turn, the effect of
this cue, when combined with the initiative distribution
of (3), resulted in MIMIC having dialogue but not task
initiative in (4). However, in addition to triggering AmbiguousAction, utterance (5) also triggered NoNewInfo,
since it did not contribute any new information. The effect of these two cues, combined with the initiative distribution in (5), was enough to lead MIMIC to take over
task initiative in (6).
2.2 Modification of Adaptation Behavior
MIMIC employs an initiative module which is decoupled from its goal selection process, while allowing the
outcome of both processes to guide its response strategy selection. A major advantage of this design is that
changes in the system's strategy selection behavior, and
thus its adaptation behavior, can be achieved by modifying parameters in the initiative module, while leaving
the goal and strategy selection processes intact. The initiative module determines initiative distribution based on
participant roles, cues observed in the current user utterance, and dialogue history. Although all three factors
may play a role in modifying MIMIC's adaptation behavior, we discuss how the effects of participant roles
and dialogue history are modified to create systems used
as bases of comparison in our experiments.
Participant roles affect the default initiative distribu

tion for MIMIC's initial utterance. For naive users, it
may be more appropriate for MIMIC to employ systeminitiative strategies. This system, MIMIC-SI, can be
achieved by setting the default initiative distribution to
provide definite evidence for the system having both task
and dialogue initiatives.' Figure 2 shows a dialogue
in which a user interacts with MIMIC-SI to obtain the
same information as in Figure 1. MIMIC-SI prompts the
user for one piece of information at a time and provides
(sometimes unnecessary) assistance, in the form of valid
dialogue moves, during each turn.
Taking into account dialogue history allows MIMIC
to determine the initiative distribution based on the cumulative effect of previously observed cues. This effect can be disabled so that only local dialogue context affects the initiative distribution for the next turn.
Based on MIMIC's parameter settings, this adjustment
results in MIMIC-MI, a system which always has dia3Based on the Dempster-Shafer theory, if the bpas of the default

behaves similarly to many existing non-adaptive mixed
initiative dialogue systems (e.g., (Bennacef et al., 1996;
Papineni et al., 1999)). Figure 3 shows a dialogue involving MIMIC-MI in which the user again attempts to
acquire the same information as in the previous two dialogues. Notice that (41)-(49) constitute a failed attempt
to solicit a theater name from the user. Instead of providing helpful information as in (6) in Figure 1, MIMIC-MI
relied on the user to change her problem-solving strategy
in (50) to obtain the information needed to answer the
system's question.
3 Experimental Design
Our main goal in evaluating MIMIC is to determine
whether users find the mixed initiative and automatic
adaptation aspects of its dialogue strategies useful. We
compared MIMIC to two control systems: MIMIC-SI
and MIMIC-MI, since they employ dialogue management strategies similar to those in many existing systems. The comparison between MIMIC and MIMIC-SI

2. Order: For each experiment, all subjects were randomly divided into two groups. One group performed tasks using MIMIC first, and the other group
used the control system first.
3. Task difficulty: 3-4 tasks which highlighted differ
ences between systems were used for each experiment. Based on the amount of information to be acquired, we divided the tasks into two groups: easy
and difficuit; an example of each is shown in Figure 4.

all tasks. The subjects completed one task per call so
that the dialogue history for one task did not affect the
next task. Once they had completed all tasks in sequence
using one system, they filled out a questionnaire to assess user satisfaction by rating 8-9 statements, similar
to those in (Walker et al., 1997), on a scale of 1-5, where
5 indicated highest satisfaction. Approximately two days
later, they attempted the same tasks using the other system.5 These experiments resulted in 112 dialogues with
approximately 2,800 dialogue turns.
In addition to user satisfaction ratings, we automatically logged, derived, and manually annotated a number of features (shown in boldface below). For each
task/subject/system triplet, we computed the task success rate based on the percentage of slots correctly filled
in on the task worksheet, and counted the # of calls
needed to complete each task.6 For each call, the userside of the dialogue was recorded, and the elapsed time
of the call was automatically computed. All user utterances were logged as recognized by our automatic
speech recognizer (ASR) and manually transcribed from
the recordings. We computed the ASR word error rate,
ASR rejection rate, and ASR timeout rate, as well as
# of user turns and average sentence length for each
task/subject/system triplet. Additionally, we recorded
the cues that the system automatically detected from
each user utterance. All system utterances were also
logged, along with the initiative distribution for each
system turn and the dialogue acts selected to generate
each system response.
4 Results and Discussion
Based on the features described above, we compared MIMIC and the control systems, MIMIC-SI and
MIMIC-MI, along three dimensions: performance features, in which comparisons were made using previously
proposed features relevant to system performance (e.g.,
(Price et al., 1992; Simpson and Fraser, 1993; Danieli
and Gerbino, 1995; Walker et al., 1997)); discourse features, in which comparisons were made using characteristics of the resulting dialogues; and initiative distribution, where initiative characteristics of all dialogues involving MIMIC from both experiments were examined.
4.1 Performance Features
For our performance evaluation, we first applied a threeway analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Cohen, 1995) to
each feature using three factors: system version, order,
neers, or linguists, and none had prior knowledge of MIMIC.
5We used the exact same set of tasks rather than designing tasks of
similar difficulty levels because we intended to compare all available
features between the two system versions, including ASR word error
rate, which would have been affected by the choice of movie/theater
names in the tasks.
6Although the vast majority of tasks were completed in one call,
some subjects, when unable to make progress, did not change strategies
as in (41)-(49) in Figure 3; instead, they hung up and started the task
over.

and task difficulty.7 If no interaction effects emerged, we
compared system versions using paired sample t-tests.8
Following the PARADISE evaluation scheme (Walker
et al., 1997), we divided performance features into four
groups:
• Task success: task success rate, # of calls.
• Dialogue quality: ASR rejection rate, ASR timeout
rate, ASR word error rate.
• Dialogue efficiency: # of user turns, elapsed time.
• System usability: user satisfaction.
For both experiments, the ANOVAs showed no interaction effects among the controlled factors. Tables 1(a)
and 1(b) summarize the results of the paired sample ttests based on performance features, where features that
differed significantly between systems are shown in italics.9 These results show that, when compared with either
7User satisfaction was a per subject as opposed to a per task performance feature; thus, we performed a two-way ANOVA using the
factors system version and order.
8This paper focuses on evaluating the effect of MIMIC's mixed initiative and automatic adaptation capabilities. We assess these effects
based on comparisons between system version when no interaction effects emerged from the ANOVA tests using the factors system version,
order, and task difficulty. Effects based on system order and task difficulty alone are beyond the scope of this paper.

1995).
206
control system, users were more satisfied with MIMIC°
and that MIMIC helped users complete tasks more efficiently. Users were able to complete tasks in fewer turns
and in a more timely manner using MIMIC.
When comparing MIMIC and MIMIC-MI, dialogues
involving MIMIC had a lower timeout rate. When
MIMIC detected cues signaling anomalies in the dialogue, it adapted strategies to provide assistance, which
in addition to leading to fewer timeouts, saved users time
and effort when they did not know what to say. In contrast, users interacting with MIMIC-MI had to iteratively
reformulate questions until they obtained the desired information from the system, leading to more timeouts
(see (41)-(49) in Figure 3). However, when comparing
MIMIC and MIMIC-SI, even though users accomplished
tasks more efficiently with MIMIC, the resulting dialogues contained more timeouts. As opposed to MIMICSI, which always prompted users for one piece of information at a time, MIMIC typically provided more openended prompts when the user had task initiative. Even
though this required more effort on the user's part in formulating utterances and led to more timeouts, MIMIC
quickly adapted strategies to assist users when recognized cues indicated that they were having trouble.
To sum up, our experiments show that both MIMIC's
mixed initiative and automatic adaptation aspects resulted in better performance along the dialogue efficiency
and system usability dimensions. Moreover, its adaptation capabilities contributed to better performance in
terms of dialogue quality. MIMIC, however, did not contribute to higher performance in the task success dimension. In our movie information domain, the tasks were
sufficiently simple; thus, all but one user in each experiment achieved a 100% task success rate.
4.2 Discourse Features
Our second evaluation dimension concerns characteristics of resulting dialogues. We analyzed features of user
utterances in terms of utterance length and cues observed
and features of system utterances in terms of dialogue
acts. For each feature, we again applied a three-way
ANOVA test, and if no interaction effects emerged, we
performed a paired sample t-test to compare system versions.
The cues detected in user utterances provide insight
into both user intentions and system capabilities. The
cues that MIMIC automatically detects are a subset of
those discussed in (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998):11
• TakeOverTask: triggered when the user provides
more information than expected; an implicit indication that the user wants to take control of the
I°The range of user satisfaction scores was 8-40 for experiment one
and 9-45 for experiment two.
11A subset of these cues corresponds loosely to previously proposed
evaluation metrics (e.g., (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995)). However, our
system automatically detects these features instead of requiring manual
annotation by experts.

• NoNewInfo: triggered when the user is unable to
make progress toward task completion, either when
the user does not know what to say or the ASR engine fails to recognize the user's utterance.
• InvalidAction/InvalidActionResolved: triggered
when the user utterance makes an invalid assumption about the domain and when the invalid
assumption is corrected, respectively.
• AmbiguousAction/AmbiguousActionResolved: trig
gered when the user query is ambiguous and when
the ambiguity is resolved, respectively.
Tables 2(a) and (b) summarize the results of the paired
sample t-tests based on user utterance features where features whose numbers of occurrences were significantly
different according to system version used are shown in
italics.12 Table 2(a) shows that users expected the system
to adapt its strategies when they attempted to take control
of the dialogue. Even though MIMIC-SI did not behave
as expected, the users continued their attempts, resulting
in significantly more occurrences of TakeOverTask in dialogues with MIMIC-SI than with MIMIC. Furthermore,
the average sentence length in dialogues with MIMIC
was only 1.5 words per turn longer than in dialogues
with MIMIC-S1, providing further evidence that users

207
preferred to provide free-formed queries, regardless of
system version used.
Table 2(b) shows that MIMIC was more effective at resolving dialogue anomalies than MIMIC-MI.
More specifically, there were significantly fewer occurrences of NoNewInfo in dialogues with MIMIC
than with MIMIC-MI. In addition, while the number
of occurrences of AmbiguousAction was not significantly different for the two systems, the number that
were resolved (AmbiguousActionResolved) was significantly higher in interactions with MIMIC than with
MIMIC-MI. Since NoNewInfo and AmbiguousAction
both prompted MIMIC to adapt strategies and, as a result, provide additional useful information, the user was
able to quickly resolve the problem at hand. This is further supported by the higher frequency of the system dialogue act GiveOptions in MIMIC (p=0), which provides
helpful information based on dialogue context.
In sum, the results of our discourse feature analysis
further confirm the usefulness of MIMIC's adaptation
capabilities. Comparisons with MIMIC-SI provide evidence that MIMIC's ability to give up initiative better
matched user expectations. Moreover, comparisons with
MIMIC-MI show that MIMIC's ability to opportunistically take over initiative resulted in dialogues in which
anomalies were more efficiently resolved and progress
toward task completion was more consistently made.
4.3 Initiative Analysis
Our final analysis concerns the task initiative distribution in our adaptive system in relation to the features previously discussed. For each dialogue involving
MIMIC, we computed the percentage of turns in which
MIMIC had task initiative and the correlation coefficient
(r) between the initiative percentage and each performance/discourse feature. To determine if this correlation
was significant, we performed Fisher's r to z transform,
upon which a conventional Z test was performed (Cohen,
1995).
Tables 3(a) and (b) summarize the correlation between
the performance and discourse features and the percentage of turns in which MIMIC has task initiative, respectively.° Again, those correlations which are statistically
significant are shown in italics. Table 3(a) shows a strong
positive correlation between task initiative distribution
and the number of user turns as well as the elapsed time
of the dialogues. Although earlier results (Table 1(a))
show that dialogues in which the system always had task
initiative tended to be longer, we believe that this correlation also suggests that MIMIC took over task initiative
more often in longer dialogues, those in which the user
was more likely to be having difficulty. Table 3(a) further shows moderate correlation between task initiative
distribution and ASR rejection rate as well as ASR word
error rate. It is possible that such a correlation exists
I3This test was not performed for user satisfaction, since user satisfaction was a per subject and not a per dialogue feature.

because ASR performance worsens when MIMIC takes
over task initiative. However, in that case, we would have
expected the results in Section 4.1 to show that the ASR
rejection and word error rates for MIMIC-SI are significantly greater than those for MIMIC, which are in turn
significantly greater than those for MIMIC-MI, since in
MIMIC-SI the system always had task initiative and in
MIMIC-MI the system never took over task initiative.
To the contrary, Tables 1(a) and 1(b) showed that the
differences in ASR rejection rate and ASR word error
rate were not significant between system versions, and
Table 1(b) showed that ASR word error rate for MIMICMI was in fact quite substantially higher than that for
MIMIC. This suggests that the causal relationship is the
other way around, i.e., MIMIC's adaptation capabilities
allowed it to opportunistically take over task initiative
when ASR performance was poor.
Table 3(b) shows that all cues are positively correlated
with task initiative distribution. For AmbiguousAction,
InvalidAction, and NoNewInfo, this correlation exists because observation of these cues contributed to MIMIC
having task initiative. However, note that AmbiguousActionResolved has a stronger positive correlation with task
initiative distribution than does AmbiguousAction, again
indicating that MIMIC's adaptive strategies contributed
to more efficient resolution of ambiguous actions.
In brief, our initiative analysis lends additional support to the conclusions drawn in our performance and
discourse feature analyses and provides new evidence
for the advantages of MIMIC's adaptation capabilities.
208
In addition to taking over task initiative when previously
identified dialogue anomalies were encountered (e.g., detection of ambiguous or invalid actions), our analysis
shows that MIMIC took over task initiative when ASR
performance was poor, allowing the system to better constrain user utterances.I4
5 Conclusions
This paper described an empirical evaluation of MIMIC,
an adaptive mixed initiative spoken dialogue system. We
conducted two experiments that focused on evaluating
the mixed initiative and automatic adaptation aspects of
MIMIC and analyzed the results along three dimensions:
performance features, discourse features, and initiative
distribution. Our results showed that both the mixed
initiative and automatic adaptation aspects of the system led to better performance in terms of user satisfaction and dialogue efficiency. In addition, we found that
MIMIC's adaptation behavior better matched user expectations, more efficiently resolved anomalies in dialogues,
and led to higher overall dialogue quality.

In this paper, we describe an empirical evaluation of an adaptive mixed initiative spoken dialogue system. We conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate the mixed initiative and automatic adaptation aspects of the system, and analyzed the resulting dialogues along three dimensions: performance factors, discourse features, and initiative distribution. Our results show that 1) both the mixed initiative and automatic adaptation aspects led to better system performance in terms of user satisfaction and dialogue efficiency, and 2) the system's adaptation behavior better matched user expectations, more efficiently resolved dialogue anomalies, and resulted in higher overall dialogue quality.

Our results show that 1) both the mixed initiative and automatic adaptation aspects led to better system performance in terms of user satisfaction and dialogue efficiency, and 2) the system's adaptation behavior better matched user expectations, more efficiently resolved dialogue anomalies, and resulted in higher overall dialogue quality. 1 Introduction Recent advances in speech technologies have enabled spoken dialogue systems to employ mixed initiative dialogue strategies (e.g. (Allen et al., 1996; Sadek et al., 1996; Meng et al., 1996)). Although these systems interact with users in a manner more similar to human-human interactions than earlier systems employing system initiative strategies, their response strategies are typically selected using only local dialogue context, disregarding dialogue history. Therefore, their gain in naturalness and performance under optimal conditions is often overshadowed by their inability to cope with anomalies in dialogues by automatically adapting dialogue strategies. In contrast, Figure 1 shows a dialogue in which the system automatically adapts dia

MIMIC-MI behaves similarly to many existing non-adaptive mixed initiative dialogue systems (e.g., (Bennacef et al., 1996; Papineni et al., 1999)). Figure 3 shows a dialogue involving MIMIC-MI in which the user again attempts to acquire the same information as in the previous two dialogues. Notice that (41)-(49) constitute a failed attempt to solicit a theater name from the user. Instead of providing helpful information as in (6) in Figure 1, MIMIC-MI relied on the user to change her problem-solving strategy in (50) to obtain the information needed to answer the system's question. 3 Experimental Design Our main goal in evaluating MIMIC is to determine whether users find the mixed initiative and automatic adaptat

Second, MIMIC's initiative module is decoupled from the dialogue manager's goal and strategy selection processes, thereby enabling the system's adaptation behavior to be easily modified. We outline characteristics of MIMIC relevant to our experiments and analyses. For further details about the system, see (Chu-Carroll, 2000). 2.1 Adaptation of Dialogue Strategies Figure 1 showed an actual interaction between MIMIC and a user.

In (4), MIMIC specified the current discourse goal (requesting information about a missing theater) but did not suggest valid response choices since it only had dialogue initiative. MIMIC's ability to automatically adapt dialogue strategies is achieved by employing an initiative module that determines initiative distribution based on participant roles, cues detected during the current user utterance, and dialogue history (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998). This initiative framework utilizes the DempsterShafer theory (Shafer, 1976; Gordon and Shortliffe, 1984), and represents the current initiative distribution as two basic probability assignments (bpas) that signify the overall amount of evidence supporting each agent having task and dialogue initiatives. The effects that a cue has on changing the current task and dialogue initiative distribution are also represented as bpas, obtained using an iterative training procedure on a corpus of transcribed 2In the dialogues collected in our experiments, which are described in Section 3, there are syst

We analyzed features of user utterances in terms of utterance length and cues observed and features of system utterances in terms of dialogue acts. For each feature, we again applied a three-way ANOVA test, and if no interaction effects emerged, we performed a paired sample t-test to compare system versions. The cues detected in user utterances provide insight into both user intentions and system capabilities. The cues that MIMIC automatically detects are a subset of those discussed in (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998):11 • TakeOverTask: triggered when the user provides more information than expected; an implicit indication that the user wants to take control of the I°The range of user satisfaction scores was 8-40 for experiment one and 9-45 for experiment two. 11A subset of these cues corresponds loosely to previously proposed evaluation metrics (e.g., (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995)).

First, MIMIC automatically adapts dialogue strategies based on dialogue characteristics and thus tailors its behavior to the dialogue context.

action was a per subject as opposed to a per task performance feature; thus, we performed a two-way ANOVA using the factors system version and order. 8This paper focuses on evaluating the effect of MIMIC's mixed initiative and automatic adaptation capabilities. We assess these effects based on comparisons between system version when no interaction effects emerged from the ANOVA tests using the factors system version, order, and task difficulty. Effects based on system order and task difficulty alone are beyond the scope of this paper. 9Typically p<0.05 is considered statistically significant (Cohen, 1995). 206 control system, users were more satisfied with MIMIC° and that MIMIC helped users complete tasks more efficiently. Users were able to complete tasks in fewer turns and in a more timely manner using MIMIC. When comparing MIMIC and MIMIC-MI, dialogues involving MIMIC had a lower timeout rate. When MIMIC detected cues signaling anomalies in the dialogue, it adapted strategies to provide assistance, which in addition to leading to fewer timeouts, saved users time and effort when they did not know what to say. In contrast, users interacting with MIMIC-MI had to iteratively reformulate questio
re efficiently resolved and progress toward task completion was more consistently made. 4.3 Initiative Analysis Our final analysis concerns the task initiative distribution in our adaptive system in relation to the features previously discussed. For each dialogue involving MIMIC, we computed the percentage of turns in which MIMIC had task initiative and the correlation coefficient (r) between the initiative percentage and each performance/discourse feature. To determine if this correlation was significant, we performed Fisher's r to z transform, upon which a conventional Z test was performed (Cohen, 1995). Tables 3(a) and (b) summarize the correlation between the performance and discourse features and the percentage of turns in which MIMIC has task initiative, respectively.° Again, those correlations which are statistically significant are shown in italics. Table 3(a) shows a strong positive correlation between task initiative distribution and the number of user turns as well as the elapsed time of the dialogues. Although earlier results (Table 1(a)) show that dialogues in which the system always had task initiative tended to be longer, we believe that this correlation also suggests that MIMIC

All system utterances were also logged, along with the initiative distribution for each system turn and the dialogue acts selected to generate each system response. 4 Results and Discussion Based on the features described above, we compared MIMIC and the control systems, MIMIC-SI and MIMIC-MI, along three dimensions: performance features, in which comparisons were made using previously proposed features relevant to system performance (e.g., (Price et al., 1992; Simpson and Fraser, 1993; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Walker et al., 1997)); discourse features, in which comparisons were made using characteristics of the resulting dialogues; and initiative distribution, where initiative characteristics of all dialogues involving MIMIC from both experiments were examined. 4.1 Performance Features For our performance evaluation, we first applied a threeway analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Cohen, 1995) to each feature using three factors: system version, order, neers, or linguists, and none had prior knowledge of MIMIC. 5We used the exact same set of tasks rather than designing tasks of similar difficulty levels

All system utterances were also logged, along with the initiative distribution for each system turn and the dialogue acts selected to generate each system response. 4 Results and Discussion Based on the features described above, we compared MIMIC and the control systems, MIMIC-SI and MIMIC-MI, along three dimensions: performance features, in which comparisons were made using previously proposed features relevant to system performance (e.g., (Price et al., 1992; Simpson and Fraser, 1993; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Walker et al., 1997)); discourse features, in which comparisons were made using characteristics of the resulting dialogues; and initiative distribution, where initiative characteristics of all dialogues involving MIMIC from both experiments were examined. 4.1 Performance Features For our performance evaluation, we first applied a threeway analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Cohen, 1995) to each feature using three factors: system version, order, neers, or linguists, and none had prior knowledge of MIMIC. 5We used the exact same set of tasks rather than designing tasks of

Once they had completed all tasks in sequence using one system, they filled out a questionnaire to assess user satisfaction by rating 8-9 statements, similar to those in (Walker et al., 1997), on a scale of 1-5, where 5 indicated highest satisfaction. Approximately two days later, they attempted the same tasks using the other system.5 These experiments resulted in 112 dialogues with approximately 2,800 dialogue turns. In addition to user satisfaction ratings, we automatically logged, derived, and manually annotated a number of features (shown in boldface below). For each task/subject/system triplet, we computed the task success rate based on the percentage of slots correctly filled in on the task worksheet, and counted the # of calls needed to complete each task.6 For each call, t

For both experiments, the ANOVAs showed no interaction effects among the controlled factors.
