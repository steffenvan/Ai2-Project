Abstract
Current spoken dialogue systems are deficient in
their strategies for preventing, identifying and repairing problems that arise in the conversation. This
paper reports results on learning to automatically
identify and predict problematic human-computer
dialogues in a corpus of 4774 dialogues collected with
the How May I Help You spoken dialogue system.
Our expectation is that the ability to predict problematic dialogues will allow the system's dialogue
manager to modify its behavior to repair problems,
and even perhaps, to prevent them. We train a
problematic dialogue classifier using automaticallyobtainable features that can identify problematic
dialogues significantly better (23%) than the baseline. A classifier trained with only automatic features from the first exchange in the dialogue can
predict problematic dialogues 7% more accurately
than the baseline, and one trained with automatic
features from the first two exchanges can perform
14% better than the baseline.
1 Introduction
Spoken dialogue systems promise efficient and natural access to a large variety of information sources
and services from any phone. Systems that support short utterances to select a particular function
(through a statement such as &quot;Say credit card, collect or person-to-person&quot;) are saving companies millions of dollars. Research prototypes exist for applications such as personal email and calendars, travel
and restaurant information, and personal banking
(Baggia et al., 1998; Walker et al., 1998; Seneff et
al., 1995; Sanderman et al., 1998; Chu-Carroll and
Carpenter, 1999) inter a/ia. Yet there are still many
research challenges: current systems are limited in
the interaction they support and brittle in many respects. We show how spoken dialogue systems can
learn to support more natural interaction on the basis of their previous experience.
One way that current spoken dialogue systems are
quite limited is in their strategies for detecting and
repairing problems that arise in conversation. If
a problem can be detected, the system can either
transfer the call to a human operator or modify its
dialogue strategy in an attempt to repair the problem. We can train systems to improve their ability to
detect problems by exploiting dialogues collected in
interactions with human users. The initial segments
of these dialogues can be used to predict that a problem is likely to occur. We expect that the ability to
predict that a dialogue is likely to be problematic
will allow the system's dialogue manager to apply
more sophisticated strategies to repairing problems,
and even perhaps, to prevent them.
This paper reports experiments on predicting
problems in spoken dialogue interaction by training a problematic dialogue predictor on a corpus of
4774 dialogues collected in an experimental trial of
AT&T's How May I Help You (HMIHY) spoken dialogue system (Gorin et al., 1997; Riccardi and Gorin,
to appear; E. Ammicht and Alonso, 1999). In this
trial, the HMIHY system was installed at an AT&T
customer care center. HMIHY answered calls from
live customer traffic and successfully automated a
large number of customer requests. An example of
a dialogue that HMIHY completed successfully is
shown in Figure 1.1

there are several other call outcomes, to be described
in detail below, which we consider problematic.

This paper reports results from a set of experiments that test whether we can learn to automatically predict that a dialogue will be problematic
on the basis of information the system has: (1)
early on in the dialogue; and (2) in real time. We
train an automatic classifer for predicting problematic dialogues from features that can be automatically extracted from the HMIHY corpus. The results show that we can learn to predict problematic
dialogues using fully automatic features with an accuracy ranging from 72% to 87%, depending on how
much of the dialogue the system has seen so far.
Section 2 describes HMIHY and the dialogue corpus
which the experiments are based on. Section 3 details the encoding of the dialogues and the methods
used for utilizing the machine learning program RIPPER to train an automatic problematic dialogue predictor (Cohen, 1996). Section 4 presents the results
and section 5 summarizes the paper and describes
future work.
2 Experimental System and Data
HMIHY is a spoken dialogue system based on the notion of call routing (Gorin et al., 1997; Chu-Carroll
and Carpenter, 1999). In the HMIHY call routing system, services that the user can access are
classified into 14 categories, plus a category called
other for calls that cannot be automated and must
be transferred to a human operator (Gorin et al.,
1997).2 Each category describes a different task,
such as person-to-person dialing, or receiving credit
for a misdialed number. The system determines
which task the caller is requesting on the basis of
its understanding of the caller's response to the
open-ended system greeting AT&T, How May I Help
You?. Once the task has been determined, the information needed for completing the caller's request is
obtained using dialogue submodules that are specific
for each task (Abella and Gorin, 1999).
In addition to the TASKSUCCESS dialogues in
which HMIHY successfully automates the customer's call, illustrated in Figure 1, and the calls
that are transferred to a human operator, there are
three other possible outcomes for a call, all of which
are problematic. The first category, which we call
HANGUP, results from a customer's decision to hang
up on the system. A sample HANGUP dialogue is
in Figure 2. A caller may hang up because s/he is
frustrated with the system; our goal is to learn from
the corpus which system behaviors led to the caller's
frustration.
The second problematic category (wizARD), results from a human customer care agent's decision to
take over the call from the system. Because HMIHY
is experimental, each call was monitored by a human
2 One potential use of our results is to provide better rules
for making the transfer decision.

agent serving as a wizard who could override the
system. There were a number of agents who participated as wizards during the trial of HMIHY and each
wizard was simply told to take over the call if s/he
perceived problems with the system's performance.
The wizard's decision was logged by the experimental setup, resulting in labelling the call as one that
the wizard took over.3 A dialogue where the wizard
decided that the dialogue was problematic and took
over the call is shown in Figure 3.

WIZARD STEPS IN
Figure 3: Sample WIZARD Dialogue
The third problematic category, the TASKFAILURE
dialogues, are cases where the system completed the
call, but carried out a task that was not the task
that the customer was actually requesting. An example TASKFAILURE dialogue is given in Figure 4:
HMIHY interpreted utterance U2 as a request to
make a third-party call e.g. to bill it to my home
phone. HMIHY then asked the caller for the information it needed to carry out this task, the caller
complied, and the system completed the call.
The corpus of 4774 dialogues used in our experiments was collected in several experimental trials
of HMIHY on live customer traffic (Riccardi and
Gorin, to appear; E. Ammicht and Alonso, 1999),
and is referred to as HM2 in (Riccardi and Gorin, to
appear)). During the trial, all of the system behaviors were automatically recorded in a log file, and
later the dialogues were transcribed by humans and
labelled with a semantic category representing the
30f course we can only infer what might have motivated
the wizard to take over the call, but we assume that the wizard
had good reason for doing so.

3 Training an Automatic
Problematic Dialogue Predictor
Our experiments apply the machine learning program RIPPER (Cohen, 1996) to automatically induce
a &quot;problematic dialogue&quot; classification model. RIPPER takes as input the names of a set of classes to
be learned, the names and ranges of values of a fixed
set of features, and training data specifying the class
and feature values for each example in a training set.
Its output is a classification model for predicting the
class of future examples. In RIPPER, the classification model is learned using greedy search guided by
an information gain metric, and is expressed as an
ordered set of if-then rules.
To apply RIPPER, the dialogues in the corpus must
be encoded in terms of a set of classes (the output
classification) and a set of input features that are
used as predictors for the classes. We start with the
dialogue categories described above, but since our
goal is to develop algorithms that predict/identify
problematic dialogues, we treat HANGUP, WIZARD
and TASKFAILURE as equivalently problematic. Thus
we train the classifier to distinguish between two
classes: TASKSUCCESS and PROBLEMATIC. Note that
our categorization is inherently noisy because we do
not know the real reasons why a caller hangs up or a
wizard takes over the call. The caller may hang up
because she is frustrated with the system, or she may
simply dislike automation, or her child may have
started crying. Similarly, one wizard may have low
confidence in the system's ability to recover from errors and use a conservative approach that results in
taking over many calls, while another wizard may be
more willing to let the system try to recover. Nevertheless we take these human actions as a human
labelling of these calls as problematic. Given this
classification, approximately 36% of the calls in the
corpus of 4774 dialogues are PROBLEMATIC and 64%
are TASKSUCCESS.
Next, we encoded each dialogue in terms of a set
of 196 features that were either automatically logged
by one of the system modules, hand-labelled by humans, or derived from raw features. We use the
hand-labelled features to produce a TOPLINE, an estimation of how well a classifier could do that had
access to perfect information. The entire feature set
is summarized in Figure 5.
â€¢ Acoustic/ASR Features
â€” recog, recog-numwords, ASR-duration, dtmfflag, rg-modality, rg-grammar
â€¢ NLU Features
â€” a confidence measure for all of the possible
tasks that the user could be trying to do
â€” salience-coverage, inconsistency, context-shift,

â€¢ Dialogue Manager Features

num-confirms, percent-confirms,
numsubdials, percent-subdials, dial-duration.
Figure 5: Features for spoken dialogues.
There are 8 features that describe the whole dialogue, and 47 features for each of the first four exchanges. We encode features for the first four exchanges because we want to predict failures before
they happen. Since 97% of the dialogues in our corpus are five exchanges or less, in most cases, any
potential problematic outcome will have occurred
by the time the system has participated in five exchanges. Because the system needs to be able to
predict whether the dialogue will be problematic using information it has available in the initial part of
the dialogue, we train classifiers that only have access to input features from exchange 1, or only the
features from exchange 1 and exchange 2. To see
whether our results generalize, we also experiment
with a subset of features that are task-independent.
We compare results for predicting problematic dia
212
logues, with results for identifying problematic dialogues, when the classifier has access to features
representing the whole dialogue.
We utilized features logged by the system because
they are produced automatically, and thus could be
used during runtime to alter the course of the dialogue. The system modules that we collected information from were the acoustic processer/automatic
speech recognizer (ASR) (Riccardi and Gorin, to appear), the natural language understanding (NLU)
module (Gorin et al., 1997), and the dialogue manager (DM) (Abella and Gorin, 1999). Below we describe each module and the features obtained from
it.
ASR takes as input the acoustic signal and
outputs a potentially errorful transcription of what
it believes the caller said. The ASR features for
each of the first four exchanges were the output
of the speech recognizer (recog), the number of
words in the recognizer output (recog-numwords),
the duration in seconds of the input to the
recognizer (asr-duration), a flag for touchtone
input (dtmf-flag), the input modality expected
by the recognizer (rg-modality) (one of: none,
speech, touchtone, speech+touchtone, touchtonecard, speech+touchtone-card, touchtone-date,
speech+touchtone-date, or none-final-prompt), and
the grammar used by the recognizer (rg-grammar).
The motivation for the ASR features is that any
one of them may have impacted performance. For
example, it is well known that longer utterances
are less likely to be recognized correctly, thus asrduration could be a clue to incorrect recognition results. In addition, the larger the grammar is, the
more likely an ASR error is, so the name of the
grammar rg-grammar could be a predictor of incorrect recognition.
The natural language understanding (NLU) module takes as input a transcription of the user's utterance from ASR and produces 15 confidence scores
representing the likelihood that the caller's task is
one of the 15 task types. It also extracts other
relevant information, such as phone or credit card
numbers. Thus 15 of the NLU features for each exchange represent the 15 confidence scores. There
are also features that the NLU module calculates
based on processing the utterance. These include
an intra-utterance measure of the inconsistency between tasks that the user appears to be requesting
(inconsistency), a measure of the coverage of the
utterance by salient grammar fragments (saliencecoverage), a measure of the shift in context between
utterances (context-shift), the task with the highest
confidence score (top-task), the task with the second
highest confidence score (nexttop-task), the value of
the highest confidence score (top-confidence), and
the difference in values between the top and nextto-top confidence scores (duff-confidence).
The motivation for these NLU features is to make
use of information that the NLU module has based
on processing the output of ASR and the current discourse context. For example, for utterances that follow the first utterance, the NLU module knows what
task it believes the caller is trying to complete. If it
appears that the caller has changed her mind, then
the NLU module may have misunderstood a previous utterance. The context-shift feature indicates
the NLU module's belief that it may have made an
error (or be making one now).
The dialogue manager (DM) takes the output of
NLU and the dialogue history and decides what it
should say to the caller next. It decides whether it
believes there is a single unambiguous task that the
user is trying to accomplish, and how to resolve any
ambiguity. The DM features for each of the first four
exchanges are the task-type label which includes a
label that indicates task ambiguity (sys-label), utterance id within the dialogue (implicit in the encoding), the name of the prompt played before the user
utterance (prompt), and whether that prompt was a
reprompt (reprompt), a confirmation (confirm), or a
subdialogue prompt (subdial), a superset of the reprompts and confirmation prompts.
The DM features are primarily motivated by previous work. The task-type label feature is to capture the fact that some tasks may be harder than
others. The utterance id feature is motivated by the
idea that the length of the dialogue may be important, possibly in combination with other features like
task-type. The different prompt features for initial
prompts, reprompts, confirmation prompts and subdialogue prompts are motivated by results indicating
that reprompts and confirmation prompts are frustrating for callers and that callers are likely to hyperarticulate when they have to repeat themselves,
which results in ASR errors (Shriberg et al., 1992;
Levow, 1998).
The DM features also include running tallies for
the number of reprompts (num-reprompts), number
of confirmation prompts (num-confirms), and number of subdialogue prompts (num-subdials), that had
been played up to each point in the dialogue, as well
as running percentages (percent-reprompts, percent.
confirms, percent-subdials). The use of running tallies and percentages is based on the assumption that
these features are likely to produce generalized predictors (Litman et al., 1999).
The features obtained via hand-labelling were human transcripts of each user utterance (tscript), a
set of semantic labels that are closely related to the
system task-type labels (human-label), age (age) and
gender (gender) of the user, the actual modality of
the user utterance (user-modality) (one of: nothing,
speech, touchtone, speech+touchtone, non-speech),
213
and a cleaned transcript with non-word noise information removed (clean-tscript). From these features
we calculated two derived features. The first was the
number of words in the cleaned transcript (cltscript
numwords), again on the assumption that utterance
length is strongly correlated with ASR and NLU errors. The second derived feature was based on calculating whether the human-label matches the syslabel from the dialogue manager (rsuccess). There
were four values for rsuccess: rcorrect, rmismatch,
rpartial-match and rvacuous-match, indicating respectively correct understanding, incorrect understanding, partial understanding, and the fact that
there had been no input for ASR and NLU to operate on, either because the user didn't say anything
or because she used touch-tone.
The whole-dialogue features derived from the perutterance features were: num-utts, num-reprompts,
percent-reprompts, num-confirms, percent-confirms,
num-subdials, and per-cent-subdials for the whole dialogue, and the duration of the entire dialogue in
seconds (dial-duration) .
In the experiments, the features in Figure 5 except
the Hand-Labelled features are referred to as the AUTOMATIC feature set. We examine how well we can
identify or predict problematic dialogues using these
features, compared to the full feature set including
the Hand-Labelled features. As mentioned earlier,
we wish to generalize our problematic dialogue predictor to other systems. Thus we also discuss how
well we can predict problematic dialogues using only
features that are both automatically acquirable during runtime and independent of the HMIHY task.
The subset of features from Figure 5 that fit this
qualification are in Figure 6. We refer to them as
the AUTO, TASK-INDEP feature set.
The output of each RIPPER experiment is a classification model learned from the training data. To
evaluate these results, the error rates of the learned
classification models are estimated using the resampling method of cross-validation. In 5-fold crossvalidation, the total set of examples is randomly divided into 5 disjoint test sets, and 5 runs of the learning program are performed. Thus, each run uses the
examples not in the test set for training and the remaining examples for testing. An estimated error
rate is obtained by averaging the error rate on the
testing portion of the data from each of the 5 runs.
Since we intend to integrate the rules learned
by RIPPER into the HMIHY system, we examine
the precision and recall performance of specific hypotheses. Because hypotheses from different crossvalidation experiments cannot readily be combined
together, we apply the hypothesis learned on one
randomly selected training set (80% of the data) to
that set's respective test data. Thus the precision
and recall results reported below are somewhat less

4 Results
We present results for both predicting and identifying problematic dialogues. Because we are interested in predicting that a dialogue will be problematic at a point in the dialogue where the system can
do something about it, we compare prediction accuracy after having only seen the first exchange of
the dialogue with prediction accuracy after having
seen the first two exchanges, with identification accuracy after having seen the whole dialogue. For
each of these situations we also compare results for
the AUTOMATIC and AUTO, TASK-INDEP feature sets
(as described earlier), with results for the whole feature set including hand-labelled features. Table 1
summarizes the results.
The baseline on the first line of Table 1 represents the prediction accuracy from always guessing the majority class. Since 64% of the dialogues
are TASKSUCCESS dialogues, we can achieve 64% accuracy from simply guessing TASKSUCCESS without
having seen any of the dialogue yet.
The first EXCHANGE 1 row shows the results of
using the AUTOMATIC features from only the first
exchange to predict whether the dialogue outcome
will be TASKSUCCESS or PROBLEMATIC. The results
show that the machine-learned classifier can predict
problematic dialogues 8% better than the baseline
after having seen only the first user utterance. Using
only task-independent automatic features (Figure 6)
the EXCHANGE 1 classifier can still do nearly as well.
The ALL row for EXCHANGE 1 indicates that even
if we had access to human perceptual ability (the
hand-labelled features) we would still only be able
to distinguish between TASKSUCCESS and PROBLEMATIC dialogues with 77% accuracy after having seen
the first exchange.

Table 1: Results for predicting and identifying problematic dialogues (SE = Standard Error)
The EXCHANGE 18z2 rows of Table 1 show the results using features from the first two exchanges in
the dialogue to predict the outcome of the dialogue.'
The additional exchange gives roughly an additional
7% boost in predictive accuracy using either of the
AUTOMATIC feature sets. This is only 8% less than
the accuracy we can achieve using these features after having seen the whole dialogue (see below). The
ALL row for EXCHANGE 18,z2 shows that we could
achieve over 86% accuracy if we had the ability to
utilize the hand-labelled features.
The FULL DIALOGUE row in Table 1 for AUTOMATIC and AUTO, TASK-INDEP features shows the
ability of the classifier to identify problematic dialogues, rather than predict them, using features for
the whole dialogue. The ALL row for the FULL DIALOGUE shows that we could correctly identify over
92% of the outcomes accurately if we had the ability
to utilize the hand-labelled features.
Note that the task-independent automatic features always perform within 2% error of the automatic features, and the hand-labelled features consistently perform with accuracies ranging from 6-8%
greater.
The rules that RIPPER learned on the basis of the
Exchange 1 automatic features are below.
Exchange 1, Automatic Features:
if (el-top-confidence < .924) A (el-dtmf-flag = '1')
then problematic,
if (el-diff-confidence < .916) A (el-asr-duration > 6.92)
then problematic,
default is tasksuccess.
According to these rules, a dialogue will be problematic if the confidence score for the top-ranked
4Since 23% of the dialogues consisted of only two exchanges, we exclude the second exchange features for those
dialogues where the second exchange consists only of the systern playing a closing prompt. We also excluded any features
that indicated to the classifier that the second exchange was
the last exchange in the dialogue.
task (given by the NLU module) is moderate or low
and there was touchtone input in the user utterance.
The second rule says that if the difference between
the top confidence score and the second-ranked confidence score is moderate or low, and the duration
of the user utterance is more than 7 seconds, predict
PROBLEMATIC.
The performance of these rules is summarized in
Table 2. These results show that given the first exchange, this ruleset predicts that 22% of the dialogues will be problematic, while 36% of them actually will be. Of the dialogues that actually will
be problematic, it can predict 41% of them. Once
it predicts that a dialogue will be problematic, it is
correct 69% of the time. As mentioned earlier, this
reflects an overall improvement in accuracy of 8%
over the baseline.
The rules learned by training on the automatic
task-independent features for exchanges 1 and 2 are
given below. As in the first rule set, the features that
the classifier appears to be exploiting are primarily
those from the ASR and NLU modules.

dialogues will be problematic, while 36% of them
actually will be. Of the problematic dialogues, it
can predict 57% of them. Once it predicts that a
dialogue will be problematic, it is correct 79% of
the time. Compared with the classifier for the first
utterance alone, this classifier has an improvement
of 16% in recall and 10% in precision, for an overall
improvement in accuracy of 7% over using the first
exchange alone.
One observation from these hypotheses is the classifier's preference for the asr-duration feature over
the feature for the number of words recognized
(recog-numwords). One would expect longer utterances to be more difficult, but the learned rulesets
indicate that duration is a better measure of utterance length than the number of words. Another observation is the usefulness of the NLU confidence
scores and the NLU salience-coverage in predicting
problematic dialogues. These features seem to provide good general indicators of the system's success
in recognition and understanding. The fact that the
main focus of the rules is detecting ASR and NLU
errors and that none of the DM behaviors are used
as predictors also indicates that, in all likelihood, the
DM is performing as well as it can, given the noisy
input that it is getting from ASR and NLU.
To identify potential improvements in the problematic dialogue predictor, we analyzed which handlabelled features made large performance improvements, under the assumption that future work can
focus on developing automatic features that approximate the information provided by these handlabelled features. The analysis indicated that the
rsuccess feature alone improves the performance of
the TOPLINE from 88.5%, as reported in (Langkilde
et al., 1999), to 92.3%. Using rsuccess as the only
feature results in 73.75% accuracy for exchange 1,
81.9% accuracy for exchanges 1&2 and 85.3% accuracy for the full dialogue. In addition, for Exchanges
1&2, the accuracy of the AUTOMATIC, TASK-INDEP
feature set plus the rsuccess feature is 86.5%, which
is only 0.2% less than the accuracy of ALL the features for Exchanges 1&2 as shown in Table 1. The
rules that RIPPER learns for Exchanges 1&2 when
the AUTOMATIC, TASK-INDEP feature set is augmented with the single hand-labelled rsuccess feature is shown below.

5 Discussion and Future Work
In summary, our results show that: (1) All feature
sets significantly improve over the baseline; (2) Using automatic features from the whole dialogue, we
can identify problematic dialogues 23% better than
the baseline; (3) Just the first exchange provides sig
216
nificantly better prediction (8%) than the baseline;
(4) The second exchange provides an additional significant (7%) improvement, (5) A classifier based on
task-independent automatic features performs with
less than 1% degradation in error rate relative to
the automatic features. Even with current accuracy
rates, the improved ability to predict problematic
dialogues means that it may be possible to field the
system without human agent oversight, and we expect to be able to improve these results.
The research reported here is the first that we
know of to automatically analyze a corpus of logs
from a spoken dialogue system for the purpose of
learning to predict problematic situations. Our work
builds on earlier research on learning to identify dialogues in which the user experienced poor speech
recognizer performance (Litman et al., 1999). However, that work was based on a much smaller set of
experimental dialogues where the notion of a good or
bad dialogue was automatically approximated rather
than being labelled by humans. In addition, because
that work was based on features synthesized over the
entire dialogues, the hypotheses that were learned
could not be used for prediction during runtime.
We are exploring several ways to improve the performance of and test the problematic dialogue predictor. First, we noted above the extent to which
the hand-labelled feature rsuccess improves classifier
performance. In other work we report results from
training an rsuccess classifier on a per-utterance level
(Walker et al., 2000), where we show that we can
achieve 85% accuracy using only fully automatic features. In future work we intend to use the (noisy)
output from this classifier as input to our problematic dialogue classifier with the hope of improving
the performance of the fully automatic feature sets.
In addition, since it is more important to minimize
errors in predicting PROBLEMATIC dialogues than errors in predicting TASKSUCCESS dialogues, we intend
to experiment with RIPPER's loss ratio parameter,
which instructs RIPPER to achieve high accuracy for
the PROBLEMATIC class, while potentially reducing
overall accuracy. Finally, we plan to integrate the
learned rulesets into the HMIHY dialogue system to
improve the system's overall performance.

Current spoken dialogue systems are deficient in their strategies for preventing, identifying and repairing problems that arise in the conversation. This paper reports results on learning to automatically identify and predict problematic human-computer dialogues in a corpus of 4774 dialogues collected with May I Help You dialogue system. Our expectation is that the ability to predict problematic dialogues will allow the system's dialogue manager to modify its behavior to repair problems, and even perhaps, to prevent them. We train a problematic dialogue classifier using automaticallyobtainable features that can identify problematic dialogues significantly better (23%) than the baseline. A classifier trained with only automatic features from the first exchange in the dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 7% more accurately than the baseline, and one trained with automatic features from the first two exchanges can perform 14% better than the baseline.

RIPPER takes as input the names of a set of classes to be learned, the names and ranges of values of a fixed set of features, and training data specifying the class and feature values for each example in a training set. Its output is a classification model for predicting the class of future examples. In RIPPER, the classification model is learned using greedy search guided by an information gain metric, and is expressed as an ordered set of if-then rules. To apply RIPPER, the dialogues in the corpus must be encoded in term

We expect that the ability to predict that a dialogue is likely to be problematic will allow the system's dialogue manager to apply more sophisticated strategies to repairing problems, and even perhaps, to prevent them. This paper reports experiments on predicting problems in spoken dialogue interaction by training a problematic dialogue predictor on a corpus of 4774 dialogues collected in an experimental trial of AT&T's How May I Help You (HMIHY) spoken dialogue system (Gorin et al., 1997; Riccardi and Gorin, to appear; E. Ammicht and Alonso, 1999). In this trial, the HMIHY system was installed at an AT&T customer care center. HMIHY answered calls from live customer traffic and successfully automated a large number of customer requests. An example of a dialogue that HMIHY completed successfully is shown in Figure 1.1 SI: AT&T How may I help you? UI: I need to [ uh ] put a call on my calling card please S2: May I have your card number, please? U2: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 S3: What number would you like to call?

An example TASKFAILURE dialogue is given in Figure 4: HMIHY interpreted utterance U2 as a request to make a third-party call e.g. to bill it to my home phone. HMIHY then asked the caller for the information it needed to carry out this task, the caller complied, and the system completed the call. The corpus of 4774 dialogues used in our experiments was collected in several experimental trials of HMIHY on live customer traffic (Riccardi and Gorin, to appear; E. Ammicht and Alonso, 1999), and is referred to as HM2 in (Riccardi and Gorin, to appear)). During the trial, all of the system behaviors were automatically recorded in a log file, and later the dialogues were transcribed by humans and labelled with a semantic category representing the 30f course we can only infer what might have motivated the wizard to take over the call, but we assume that the wizard had good reason for doing so. 211 Si: AT&T How may I help you?

We compare results for predicting problematic dia212 logues, with results for identifying problematic dialogues, when the classifier has access to features representing the whole dialogue. We utilized features logged by the system because they are produced automatically, and thus could be used during runtime to alter the course of the dialogue. The system modules that we collected information from were the acoustic processer/automatic speech recognizer (ASR) (Riccardi and Gorin, to appear), the natural language understanding (NLU) module (Gorin et al., 1997), and the dialogue manager (DM) (Abella and Gorin, 1999). Below we describe each module and the features obtained from it. ASR takes as input the acoustic signal and outputs a potentially errorful transcription of what it believes the caller said. The ASR features for each of the first four exchanges were the output of the speech recognizer (recog), the number of words in the recognizer output (recog-numwords), the duration in seconds of the input to the recognizer (asr-duration), a flag for touchtone input (dtmf-flag), the input modality expected by the recognizer (rg-modality) (one of: none,

ehaviors are used as predictors also indicates that, in all likelihood, the DM is performing as well as it can, given the noisy input that it is getting from ASR and NLU. To identify potential improvements in the problematic dialogue predictor, we analyzed which handlabelled features made large performance improvements, under the assumption that future work can focus on developing automatic features that approximate the information provided by these handlabelled features. The analysis indicated that the rsuccess feature alone improves the performance of the TOPLINE from 88.5%, as reported in (Langkilde et al., 1999), to 92.3%. Using rsuccess as the only feature results in 73.75% accuracy for exchange 1, 81.9% accuracy for exchanges 1&2 and 85.3% accuracy for the full dialogue. In addition, for Exchanges 1&2, the accuracy of the AUTOMATIC, TASK-INDEP feature set plus the rsuccess feature is 86.5%, which is only 0.2% less than the accuracy of ALL the features for Exchanges 1&2 as shown in Table 1.

he task-type label feature is to capture the fact that some tasks may be harder than others. The utterance id feature is motivated by the idea that the length of the dialogue may be important, possibly in combination with other features like task-type. The different prompt features for initial prompts, reprompts, confirmation prompts and subdialogue prompts are motivated by results indicating that reprompts and confirmation prompts are frustrating for callers and that callers are likely to hyperarticulate when they have to repeat themselves, which results in ASR errors (Shriberg et al., 1992; Levow, 1998). The DM features also include running tallies for the number of reprompts (num-reprompts), number of confirmation prompts (num-confirms), and number of subdialogue prompts (num-subdials), that had been played up to each point in the dialogue, as well as running percentages (percent-reprompts, percent. confirms, percent-subdials). The use of running tallies and percentages is based on the assumption that these features are likely to produce generalized predictors (Litman et al., 1999).

The use of running tallies and percentages is based on the assumption that these features are likely to produce generalized predictors (Litman et al., 1999). The features obtained via hand-labelling were human transcripts of each user utterance (tscript), a set of semantic labels that are closely related to the system task-type labels (human-label), age (age) and gender (gender) of the user, the actual modality of the user utterance (user-modality) (one of: nothing, speech, touchtone, speech+touchtone, non-speech), 213 and a cleaned transcript with non-word noise information removed (clean-tscript). From these features we calculated two derived features. The first was the number of words in the cleaned transcript (cltscript numwords), again on th

ted by previous work. The task-type label feature is to capture the fact that some tasks may be harder than others. The utterance id feature is motivated by the idea that the length of the dialogue may be important, possibly in combination with other features like task-type. The different prompt features for initial prompts, reprompts, confirmation prompts and subdialogue prompts are motivated by results indicating that reprompts and confirmation prompts are frustrating for callers and that callers are likely to hyperarticulate when they have to repeat themselves, which results in ASR errors (Shriberg et al., 1992; Levow, 1998). The DM features also include running tallies for the number of reprompts (num-reprompts), number of confirmation prompts (num-confirms), and number of subdialogue prompts (num-subdials), that had been played up to each point in the dialogue, as well as running percentages (percent-reprompts, percent. confirms, percent-subdials). The use of running tallies and percentages is based on the assumption that these features are likely to produce generalized predictors (Litman et al., 1999). The features obtained via hand-labelling were human transcripts of each user utterance (tscript

e trained with automatic features from the first two exchanges can perform 14% better than the baseline. 1 Introduction Spoken dialogue systems promise efficient and natural access to a large variety of information sources and services from any phone. Systems that support short utterances to select a particular function (through a statement such as &quot;Say credit card, collect or person-to-person&quot;) are saving companies millions of dollars. Research prototypes exist for applications such as personal email and calendars, travel and restaurant information, and personal banking (Baggia et al., 1998; Walker et al., 1998; Seneff et al., 1995; Sanderman et al., 1998; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999) inter a/ia. Yet there are still many research challenges: current systems are limited in the interaction they support and brittle in many respects. We show how spoken dialogue systems can learn to support more natural interaction on the basis of their previous experience. One way that current spoken dialogue systems are quite limited is in their strategies for detecting and repairing problems that arise in conversation. If a problem can be detected, the system can either transfer the call to a human operator or mod

ues where the notion of a good or bad dialogue was automatically approximated rather than being labelled by humans. In addition, because that work was based on features synthesized over the entire dialogues, the hypotheses that were learned could not be used for prediction during runtime. We are exploring several ways to improve the performance of and test the problematic dialogue predictor. First, we noted above the extent to which the hand-labelled feature rsuccess improves classifier performance. In other work we report results from training an rsuccess classifier on a per-utterance level (Walker et al., 2000), where we show that we can achieve 85% accuracy using only fully automatic features. In future work we intend to use the (noisy) output from this classifier as input to our problematic dialogue classifier with the hope of improving the performance of the fully automatic feature sets. In addition, since it is more important to minimize errors in predicting PROBLEMATIC dialogues than errors in predicting TASKSUCCESS dialogues, we intend to experiment with RIPPER's loss ratio parameter, which instructs RIPPER to achieve high accuracy for the PROBLEMATIC class, while potentially reducing overall
