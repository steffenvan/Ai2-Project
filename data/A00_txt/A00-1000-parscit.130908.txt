ANLP 2000—PREFACE
131 papers were submitted to ANLP-2000. 46 were accepted for presentation at the conference.
Papers came from 24 countries: fifty eight from the United States of America, eleven each from
Germany and United Kingdom, nine from Canada, eight from Japan, four each from Italy and
Spain, three each from France, Korea and Switzerland, two each from Australia, China, The
Netherlands and Sweden and one each from Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, India,
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Norway, Russia and Taiwan.
40 papers were submitted from industry. 85 papers came from academia.
2 papers were submitted from government organizations and four submissions were combined.
The reviewing process was supported by a web-based reviewer interface developed by Elisha
Kane at New Mexico State University's Computing Research Lab. Linda Fresques of CRL
coordinated the refereeing process.
I would like to express my gratitude to and appreciation of the Program Committee members
responsible for the six areas:
Lynn Carlson, Tools and Resources for Developing NLP Systems Subcommittee
Eduard Hovy, Integrated NLP Systems Subcommittee
Richard Kittredge, Multilingual Text Processing Subcommittee
Ray Perrault, Spoken Language Systems Subcommittee
Oliviero Stock, Monolingual Text Processing Systems Subcommittee
John White, Evaluation Subcommittee
The following colleagues did the bulk of the reviewing:
Doug Appelt Igor Boguslavsky David Carter
Fabio Ciravegna Jim Cowie Ido Dagan
Robert Dale John Dowding Andreas Eisele
Michael Elhadad Jim Glass Oren Glilanan
Ralph Grishman Jan Haji d Donna Harman
