Preface
Recent years have seen a growing interest in the application of NLP techniques to texts
in the domains of biology and medicine. The problem of information overload that has
resulted from the massive growth in the scientific literature has clearly shown the
necessity to automatically locate, organize and manage facts relating to experimental
results. At the same time clinicians have experienced greatly improved access to the
medical literature and clinical repositories which needs to be matched by the
development of enhanced information access tools. This year NLPBA
(http://www.genisis.ch/~natlang/NLPBA02/) and BioNLP (http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-
tokyo.ac.jp/ACL03/bionlp.htm) have merged to form a joint workshop with the aim of
bringing together researchers from natural language processing, bio-informatics,
medicine and ontologies who are concerned with developing methods and resources for
solving these problems.
Over the last five years we have seen significant steps forward in the development of
language technology and large-scale resources for the Bio-Medical domain such as
linguistically annotated corpora (e.g. GENIA POS and NE corpora), ontologies (e.g.
Gene Ontology), thesauri (e.g. UMLS Metathesaurus), lexicons and term lists (e.g.
UMLS SPECIALIST) as well as information retrieval collections (e.g. TREC Genomics
track). At the application level we see development of question answering systems,
event recognition, zone (rhetorical region) identification, as well as term and bio-entity
recognition. The demand for information access tools from domain users is increasing
to support literature survey, often integrated into online ‘portals’ where scientists can
navigate through related information resources such as genetics and disease databases.
Ongoing challenges relate to the growing and ambiguous nomenclature, the need to
integrate deep knowledge sources into machine learning, a need to scale up methods for
processing full text articles etc.
The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers in this area, to establish
common themes and goals between different groups. We have seen from previous
experience in the natural language learning and information retrieval communities the
benefits of sharing resources and developing common evaluation criteria. In this
workshop we are introducing a special shared task to promote discussion of these issues
as well as the objective of integrating machine learning with knowledge resources.
In getting the workshop program finalized we are very grateful to our program
committee for their many efforts under a short time schedule. Also we acknowledge the
kind support of the COLING-2004 workshop and local organizers as well as the GENIA
group at University of Tokyo for their hard work organizing the shared task. Finally, we
would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers to the workshop and for
helping to give us such a wealth of choice in the final program.
