<bodyText confidence="0.999835555555556">
We propose a new approach to text
categorization based upon the ideas of
summarization. It combines word-based
frequency and position method to get
categorization knowledge from the title field
only. Experimental results indicate that
summarization-based categorization can
achieve acceptable performance on Reuters
news corpus.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947117647059">
With the current explosive growth of Internet
usage, the demand for fast and useful access to
online data is increasing. An efficient
categorization system should provide accurate
information quickly. There are many
applications for text categorization, including
information retrieval, text routing, text filtering
and text understanding systems.
The text categorization systems use
predefined categories to label new documents.
Many different approaches have been applied to
this task, including nearest neighbor classifiers
(Masand, Linoff and Waltz, 1992; Yang, 1994;
Lam and Ho, 1998; Yang, 1999), Bayesian
independence classifiers (Lewis and Ringuette,
1994; Baker and McCallum, 1998; McCallum
and Nigam, 1998), decision trees (Fuhr et al.,
1991; Lewis and Ringuette, 1994; Apte et al.,
1998), induction rule learning (Apte et al., 1994;
Cohen and Singer, 1996; Mouilinier et al., 1996),
neural networks (Wiener, Pedersen and Weigend,
1995; Ng, Goh and Low, 1997), and support
vector machines (Joachims, 1998). These
categorization algorithms have been applied to
many different subject domains, usually news
stories (Apte et al., 1994; Lewis and Ringuette,
1994; Wiener, Pedersen and Weigend, 1995;
Yang, 1999), but also physics abstracts (Fuhr et
al., 1991), and medical texts (Yang and Chute,
1994).
In this research to resolve the task of text
categorization we apply a method of text
summarization, that is, combining word-based
frequency and position method to get
categorization knowledge from the title field
only. Experimental results indicate that
summarization-based categorization can achieve
acceptable performance on Reuters news corpus.
Additionally, the computation time for the title
field is very short. Thus, this system is
appropriate for online document classifier.
Following is a description of the organization
of this paper. Section 2 describes the previous
work of summarization. Summarization-based
algorithms for text categorization are outlined in
Section 3. The experiments we undertook to
assess the performance of these algorithms are
the topic of Section 4. Quantitative
experimental results are also summarized.
Finally, concluding remarks and
recommendation for future work is made.

1 Text Summarization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846176470588">
The task of summarization is to identify
informative evidence from a given document,
which are most relevant to its content and create
a shorter version of summary of the document
from this information. The informative
evidence associated with techniques used in
summarization may also provide clues for text
categorization to determine the appropriate
category of the document.
Several techniques for text summarization
have been reported in the literature, including
methods based on position (Edmundson, 1969;
Hovy and Lin, 1997; Teufel and Moens, 1997),
cue phrase (McKeown and Radev, 1995;
Mahesh, 1997), word frequency (Teufel and
Moens, 1997), and discourse segmentation
(Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997356">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953478260869">
Of the above approaches, both word
frequency and position methods are easy to
implement. In this research we combine these
two approaches to investigate the efforts for
categorization. In regard to the position
method, Hovy and Lin (1997) considered the
title is the most likely to bear topics. They
claim words in titles are positively relevant to
summarization. Teufel and Moens (1997) also
confirmed this viewpoint; they mentioned that
words in the title are good candidates for
document specific concepts. They showed
21.7% recall and precision, when the title
method is used alone, with an increased
performance of 3%, when combined with other
methods.
Furthermore, from observation of the TREC
evaluation during recent years, it has been
shown that there is no significant difference
between short and long query. It seems
reasonable to acquire informative clues from the
title, still not degrading the categorization
performance severely.

2 Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999826">
This section describes a series of algorithms
based on the title summarization technique for
text categorization.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998051">
2.1 Preprocessing and Feature Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999684">
We divide the corpus texts into words, delineate
by white space and punctuation. All characters
are lower-case and stop words are removed.
After the words are stemmed, we call them
terms. These terms are then used as features.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999235">
2.2 Term Weighting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970642769230769">
Weights are now assigned to the surviving
features in each category. We design several
different formulas for term weighting. In each
formula, we associate a weight, W(f c), with
each surviving feature, f, in category c, in the
same way weights can be obtained in
information retrieval when assigning them to
index terms. In addition, we normalize the
value of term frequency, y, between categories.
The probability of category is also taken into
account. We define W(f c) as equations 1
through 3. .

associated with each feature f in each category c.
Given a document, d, a rank can be associated
with each category with respect to d. Let F, is
the set of features, f, in category c. The ranking
of category c with respect to document d,R(c, d),
is defined as equation 4.

To assess the proposed method&apos;s effectiveness,
we apply the algorithms described in the
previous section and conduct a series of
experiments. Tests are performed on the
Reuters corpus. A general description of the
materials used in these experiments follows.
Finally, the success rates are quantitatively
evaluated.

3.1 The Reuters Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999287">
To make our effectiveness comparable to other
researchers&apos; results in text categorization, we
chose the commonly used Reuters news story
corpus for the data. This corpus has many

there are at least five versions of the Reuters
corpus, depending on how the training/test sets
are divided and the scope of categories or
documents used for evaluation. In this paper,
we select the Reuters version 3 (a formatted
version is currently available at Yang&apos;s
homepage http://moscow.mt.cs.cmu.edu:
8081/reuters_21450/apte), constructed by Apte
et al., as our data set.
This version contains 7,789 training and 3,309
test documents within 93 categories. The
distribution of category number is tabulated in
Table 1. Most of these documents have only a
single category, but some documents are
multicategory. The average numbers of
categories per document are 1.23 and 1.24 on
training and test sets, respectively. The number
of training documents per category varies widely,
from 2 (dfl, fishmeal, ..., etc.) to a maximum of
2,877 (earn). Tables 2 and 3 show the top ten
most frequent categories and ten least frequent
categories on the training sets. The average
length of title field and whole document are 7.4
and 126.9 words per document, respectively.

3.2 Experimental Design

<bodyText confidence="0.999751923076923">
In this paper, we only use TITLE field as the
scope of texts. In our first experiment, the
variable is variant term weighting formulas that
are described in Section 3. We want to see the
effects on categorization performance, when
probability of category and normalized process
of term frequency are used. The first
experiment is summarized in Table 4.
A second experiment is to locate the most
preferred threshold value of minimum term
frequency. For the number of features in our
experiment, the values 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200,
300 and 900 are tested.

It seems to point out that small text size (only
TITLE field is used) is not bad for text
categorization, when compared with kNN&apos;s 93%
and LLSF&apos;s 92% for full texts (Yang, 1999).
The other experimental variable is the number
of chosen features. Table 5 shows the large
feature sets earn the better result when
probability is absent.
In the next experiment, with the term
weighting formula fixed at Eq. 1-d (Method 4),
we vary the minimum number of term frequency
from 1 to 3. Table 6 indicates that there are no
significant differences among judgements, but
shows a little improvement for those small
threshold values. The data also shows that the
information contained in the title field is almost
come together and very little noise. Thus, it
seems to have no effects for the processing of
sparse data.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938272727273">
In this paper, we apply the most popular
methods, in text summarization, position and
word frequency, to resolve the task of text
categorization. We use a word-based term
weighted technique from the title field, which is
informative but short in length, to process
categorization. The results show short title
field will reduce execution time, and provide
acceptable performance. Thus, this system
would be appropriate for an online document
classifier.
Previous work shows the hybrid approach for
the text categorization and summarization is
more efficient than a single scheme. Thus, we
will try to combine several schemes in the future.
In addition, in the position method, we could use
hybrid structure to consider the title and some
specific position in the document, for instance,
the first sentence in the first paragraph or the
first sentence in the second paragraph. When
there is insufficient information in title field, it is
helpful to proceed to the next position.

The informative evidence associated with techniques used in summarization may also provide clues for text categorization to determine the appropriate category of the document. Several techniques for text summarization have been reported in the literature, including methods based on position (Edmundson, 1969; Hovy and Lin, 1997; Teufel and Moens, 1997), cue phrase (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Mahesh, 1997), word frequency (Teufel and Moens, 1997), and discourse segmentation (Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997). 79 Of the above approaches, both word frequency and position methods are easy to implement. In this research we combine these two approaches to investigate the efforts for categorization. In regard to the position method, Hovy and Lin (1997) considered the title is the most likely to bear topics. They claim words in titles are positively relevant to summarization. Teufel and Moens (1997) also confirmed this viewpoint; they mentioned that words </context>

Finally, the success rates are quantitatively evaluated. 3.1 The Reuters Corpus To make our effectiveness comparable to other researchers&apos; results in text categorization, we chose the commonly used Reuters news story corpus for the data. This corpus has many different versions. Yang (1999) points out (Eq. 1-b) (Eq. 1-c) (Eq. 1-d) (Eq. 2) (Eq. 3) 80 there are at least five versions of the Reuters corpus, depending on how the training/test sets are divided and the scope of categories or documents used for evaluation. In this paper, we select the Reuters version 3 (a formatted version is currently available at Yang&apos;s homepage http://moscow.mt.cs.cmu.edu: 8081/reuters_21450/apte), constructed by Apte et al., as our data set. This version contains 7,789 training and 3,309 test documents within 93 categories. The distribution of category number is tabulated in Table 1. Most of these </context>

The other experimental variable is the number of chosen features. Table 5 shows the large feature sets earn the better result when probability is absent. In the next experiment, with the term weighting formula fixed at Eq. 1-d (Method 4), we vary the minimum number of term frequency from 1 to 3. Table 6 indicates that there are no significant differences among judgements, but shows a little improvement for those small threshold values. The data also shows that the information contained in the title field is almost come together and very little noise. Thus, it seems to have no effects for the</context>
