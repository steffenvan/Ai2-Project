<bodyText confidence="0.999738863636364">
This paper describes novel results on the char-
acteristics of three-party dialogues by quantita-
tively comparing them with those of two-party.
In previous dialogue research, two-party dia-
logues are mainly focussed because data col-
lection of multi-party dialogues is difficult and
there are very few theories handling them, al-
though research on multi-party dialogues is ex-
pected to be of much use in building computer
supported collaborative work environments and
computer assisted instruction systems. In this
paper, firstly we describe our data collection
method of multi-party dialogues using a meet-
ing scheduling task, which enables us to com-
pare three-party dialogues with those of two
party. Then we quantitively compare these
two kinds of dialogues such as the number of
characters and turns and patterns of informa-
tion exchanges. Lastly we show that patterns
of information exchanges in speaker alternation
and initiative-taking can be used to characterise
three-party dialogues.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999884256410256">
Previous research on dialogue has been mostly
focussing on two-party human-human dialogue
for developing practical human-computer dia-
logue systems. However, our everyday commu-
nicative activities involves not only two-party
communicative situations but also those of more
than two-party (we call this multi-party). For
example, it is not unusual for us to chitchat with
more than one friend, or business meetings are
usually held among more than two participants.
Recently advances of computer and network-
ing technologies enable us to examine the possi-
bility of using computers to assist effective com-
munication in business meetings. As well as
this line of computer assisted communication
research, autonomous programs called &apos;agents&apos;,
which enable users to effectively use comput-
ers for solving problems, have been extensively
studied. In this research trend, &apos;agent&apos; is sup-
posed to be distributed among computers, and
how they cooperate for problem solving is one
of the most important research topics. Pre-
vious studies on two party dialogue can be of
some use to the above important computer re-
lated communication research, but research on
multi-party interaction can contribute more di-
rectly to the advances of the above research.
Furthermore, research on multi-party dialogue
is expected to make us understand the nature
of human communication in combination with
the previous and ongoing research on two-party
dialogue.
The purpose of this paper is to quantitively
show the characteristics of multi-party dia-
logues in comparison with those of two-party
using actual dialogue data. In exploring the
characteristics of multi-party dialogues to those
of two-party, we will concentrate on the follow-
ing problems.

what B are told by A, which C will be told
the same content twice, and too efficient
and strict if A, B and C always initiate new

sons usually control the flow of informa-
tion for effective and efficient discussions.
Are there any differences between in multi-
and two-party dialogues? For example, are
there any possibilities if in multi-party di-
alogues the role of chairpersons emerges
from the nature of the dialogues?
These are not only problems in exploring
multi-party dialogues. For example, we do
not know how conversational participants take
turns (when do they start to talk)? Or how
and when do conversational participants form
small subgroups? However, the two problems
we will tackle here are very important issues to
building computer systems in that they directly
relates to topic management in dialogue pro-
cessing, which is necessary to correctly process
anaphora/ellipsis and effective dialogue control.
In the following, firstly, previous research on
multi-party dialogues is surveyed. Secondly, our
task domain, data collection method, and ba-
sic statistics of the collected data are explained.
Thirdly, our dialogue coding scheme, coding re-
sults and the resultant patterns of information
exchanges for two- and multi-party dialogues
are shown. Lastly, the patterns of initiative tak-
ing behaviour are discussed.

Sugito and Sawaki (1979) analysed three nat-
urally occurring dialogues to characterise lan-
guage behaviour of Japanese in shopping situ-
ations between a shop assistant and two cus-
tomers. They relate various characteristics of
their dialogue data such as the number of ut-
terances, the types of information exchanges
and patterns of initiative taking to the stages
or phases of shopping like opening, discussions
between customers, clarification by a customer
with a shop assistant and closing.
Novick and Ward (1993) proposed a compu-
tational model to track belief changes of a pilot
and an air traffic controller in air traffic control
(ATC) communication. ATC might be called
multi-party dialogue in terms of the number of
conversational participants. An air traffic con-
troller exchanges messages with multiple pilots.
But this is a rather special case for multi-party
dialogues in that all of ATC communication
consists of two-party dialogues between a pilot
and an air traffic controller.
Novick et al. (1996) extended &apos;contribution
graph&apos; and how mutual belief is constructed
for multi-party dialogues, which was proposed
by Clark (1992). They used their extension to
analyse an excerpt of a conversation between
Nixon and his brain trust involving the Water-
gate scandal. Clark&apos;s contribution graph can be
thought of as a reformulation of adjacency pairs
and insertion sequences in conversation analy-
sis from the viewpoint that how mutual belief is
constructed, and are devoted to the analysis of
two-party dialogues. They proposed to include
reactions of non-intended listeners as evidence
for constructing mutual belief and modify the
notation of the contribution graph.
Schegloff (1996) pointed out three research
topics of multi-party dialogue from the view-
point of conversation analysis. The first topic
involves recipient design. A speaker builds ref-
erential expressions for the intended listener to
be easily understood, which is related to next
speaker selection. The second concerns reason-
ing by non-intended listeners. When a speaker
praises some conversational participant, the re-
maining participants can make inferences that
the speaker criticises what they do not do or
behave like the praised participant. The third
is schism, which can be often seen in some par-
ties or teaching classes. For example, when a
speaker continue to talk an uninteresting story
for hours, party attendees split to start to talk
neighbours locally.
Eggins and Slade (1997) analysed naturally-
occurring dialogues using systemic grammar
framework to characterise various aspects of
communication such as how attitude is encoded
in dialogues, how people negotiate with, and
support for and confront against others, and
how people establish group membership.
By and large, on multi-party dialogues, there
are very few studies in computational linguis-
tics and there are several or more researches on
multi-party dialogue, which analyse only their
example dialogues in discourse analysis. But as
far as we know, there is no research on quanti-
tatively comparing the characteristics of multi-

party dialogues with those of two-party. Re-
search topics enumerated for conversation anal-
ysis are also of interest to computational lin-
guistic research, but obviously we cannot han-
dle all the problems of multi-party dialogues
here. This paper will concentrate on the pat-
terns of information exchanges and initiative
taking, which are among issues directly related
to computer modelling of multi-party dialogues.

For the purpose of developing distributed au-
tonomous agents working for assisting users
with problem solving, we planned and collected
two- and three-party dialogues using the task
of scheduling meetings. We tried to set up the
same problem solving situations for both types
of dialogues such as participants&apos; goals, knowl-
edge, gender, age and background education.
Our goal is to develop computational applica-
tions where agents with equal status solve users&apos;
problems by exchanging messages, which is the
reason why he did not collect dialogue data
between between different status like expert-
novice and teacher-pupils.
The experiments were conducted in such a
way that for one task, the subjects are given
a list of goals (meetings to be scheduled) and
some pieces of information about meeting rooms
and equipments like overhead projectors, and
are instructed to make a meeting schedule for
satisfying as many participants&apos; constraints as
possible. The data were collected by assigning
3 different problems or task settings to 12 par-
ties, which consist of either two or three sub-
jects, which amounts to 72 dialogues in total.
The following conditions were carefully set up
to make dialogue subjects as equal as possible.

In these experiments, dialogues among the
subjects were recorded on DAT recorders in
non-face-to-face condition, which excludes the
effects of non-linguistic behaviour. The aver-
age length of all collected dialogues is 473.5 sec-
onds (approximately 7.9 minutes) and the total
amounts to 34094 seconds (approximately 9.5
hours).
There are dialogues in which participants
mistakenly finished before they did not satisfy
all possible constraints. It is very rare that one
party did this sort of mistakes for all three task
settings assigned to them, however in order to
eliminate unknown effects, we exclude all three
dialogues if they made mistakes in at least one
task setting. For this reason, we limit the target
of our analysis to 18 dialogues each for two- and
three-party dialogues which do not have such
kind of problem (the average length of the tar-
get dialogues is 494.2 seconds (approximately
8.2 minutes).

the experimental setup worked as intended be-

shows ANOVA of the number of hiragana char-
acters and turns calculated separately for dif-
ferent task settings to examine whether there
are differences of the number of characters and
turns between speakers. The results indicates
that there are statistically no differences at .05
level to the number of characters and turns for
different speakers both in two- and three-party
dialogues except for one task setting as to the
number of turns in three-party dialogues. But
this are statistically no differences at .01 level.
For the experimental setup, we can understand
that our setup generally worked as intended.

<bodyText confidence="0.999943090909091">
To examine patterns of information exchanges
and initiative taking, we classify utterances
from the viewpoint of initiation-response and
speech act types. This classification is a
modification of the DAMSL coding scheme,
which comes out of the standardisation work-
shop on discourse coding scheme (Carletta et
al., 1997b), and a coding scheme proposed by
Japanese standardisation working group on dis-
course coding scheme(Ichikawa et al., 1998)
adapted to the characteristics of this meeting
scheduling task and Japanese. We used two
coders to classify utterances in the above 36
dialogues and obtained 70% rough agreement
and 55% kappa agreement value. Even in the
above discourse coding standardisation groups,
they are not at the stage where which agreement
value range coding results need to be reliable.
In content analysis, they require a kappa value
over 0.67 for deriving a tentative conclusion,
but in a guideline of medical science, a kappa
value 0.41 &lt; c &lt; 0.60 are judged to be mod-
erate (Carletta et al., 1997a; Landis and Koch,
1977; Krippendorff, 1980). To make the anal-
ysis of our dialogue data robust, we analysed
both coded dialogues, and obtained similar re-
sults. As space is limited, instead of discussing
both results, we discuss one result in the fol-
lowing. From the aspect of initiation-response,
utterances are examined if they fall into the cat-
egory of response, which is judged by checking
if they can discern cohesive relations between
the current and corresponding utterances if ex-

ist. The corresponding utterances must be ones
which are either just before the current or some
utterances before the current in the case of em-
bedding, or insertion sequences. If the current
utterance is not judged as response, then it falls
into the category of initiation.
From speech act types, as in Table 3, utter-
ances are classified into five types each for ini-
tiating and responding, two of which are used
for both initiating and responding. Bar (`-&apos;) in-
serted categories show adaptation to our task
domain and Japanese. For example, in this task
domain, expressions of &apos;want&apos; for using some
meeting room are hard to be distinguished from
those of &apos;proposal&apos; in Japanese, and thus these
two categories are combined into one category
&apos;want-proposal&apos;.

Table 5 shows the frequency ratio as to the

act sequences are defined to start from a newly
initiating utterance to the one before next newly
initiating utterance. Let us examine an excerpt
in Table 4 from our dialogue data, where the
first column shows a tentative number of utter-

two types of act sequences from the first to the
fifth utterance (E-S-E-S-E) and from the sixth

the first turn is named A, and the one in the
second and third turn are named B and C, re-
spectively.
In both two- and three-party dialogues, the
most frequent length of act sequences is that of
two speakers. The frequencies decrease as the
length of act sequences increases. In two-party
dialogues, speaker sequences concern only their
length, since there are two speakers to be alter-
nate while in three-party dialogues, more than
two length of sequences take various patterns,
for example, A-B-A and A-B-C in three act se-
quences. Table 6 illustrates patterns of speaker
sequences and their frequency ratios. In three
act sequences, the frequency ratios of A-B-A
and A-B-C are 62.7% and 37.3%, respectively,
which signifies the dominance of two-party in-
teractions. Likewise, in four, five and six act se-
quences, two-party interactions are dominant,
53.2%, 36.7% and 31.8%, both of which are
far more frequent than theoretical expected fre-
quencies (25%, 12.5 and 6.3%). In three-party
dialogues, two-party interactions amounts to
70.6% (45.1%+26.0% x 62.7%+12.2%x 53.2%+
5.4% x 36.7% + 2.4% x 31.8% = 70.6%) against
total percentage 91.1% from two to six act se-
quences (if extrapolating this number to total
100% is allowable, 77.5% of the total interac-
tions are expected to be of two-party). The
conclusion here is that two-party inter-
actions are dominant in three-party dia-
logues. This conclusion holds for our meeting
scheduling dialogue data, but intuitively its ap-
plicability to other domains seems to be promis-
ing, which should obviously need further work.

The algorithm to track the initiative was pro-
posed by Chu-Carroll and Brown (1997). The
relationship between the initiative and efficiency
of task-oriented dialogues was empirically and
analytically examined in (Ishizaki, 1997). By
their definition, a conversational participant has
the initiative when she makes some utterance
except for responses to partner&apos;s utterance. The
reason for this exception is that an utterance
following partner&apos;s utterance should be thought
of as the one elicited by the previous speaker
rather than directing a conversation in their
own right. A participant does not have the
initiative (or partner has the initiative) when
she uses a prompt to partner, since she clearly
abdicates her opportunity for expressing some
propositional content.
Table 7 and 8 show the frequency ratios of
who takes the initiative and x2 value calculated
from the frequencies for two- and three-party di-
alogues. In two-party dialogues, based on its x2
values, the initiative is not equally distributed
between speakers in 5 out of 18 dialogues at .05
rejection level. In three-party dialogues, this
occurs in 10 out of 18 dialogues, which signifies
the emergence of an initiative-taker or a chair-
person. To examine the roles of the participants
in detail, the differences of the participants&apos; be-

tion exchanges in Table 9. The table shows the
comparison between two and three speaker in-
teractions in three-party dialogues as to as who
takes the initiative in 3 to 6 act sequences. From
this table, we can observe the tendency that E
takes the initiative more frequently than S and
H for all three problem settings in two-party
interaction, and two of three settings in three-
party interaction. S has a tendency to take more
initiatives in two-party interaction than that in
three-party. H&apos;s initiative taking behaviour is
the other way around to S&apos;s. Comparing with
S&apos;s and H&apos;s initiative taking patterns, E can be
said to take the initiative constantly irrespective
of the number of party in interaction.
The conclusion here is that initiative-
taking behaviour is more clearly observed
in three-party dialogues than those in
two-party dialogues. Detailed analysis of
the participants&apos; behaviour indicates that there
might be differences when the participants take
the initiative, which are characterised by the
number of participants in interaction.

<abstract confidence="0.999469130434782">This paper describes novel results on the characteristics of three-party dialogues by quantitatively comparing them with those of two-party. In previous dialogue research, two-party dialogues are mainly focussed because data collection of multi-party dialogues is difficult and there are very few theories handling them, although research on multi-party dialogues is expected to be of much use in building computer supported collaborative work environments and computer assisted instruction systems. In this paper, firstly we describe our data collection method of multi-party dialogues using a meeting scheduling task, which enables us to compare three-party dialogues with those of two party. Then we quantitively compare these two kinds of dialogues such as the number of characters and turns and patterns of information exchanges. Lastly we show that patterns of information exchanges in speaker alternation and initiative-taking can be used to characterise three-party dialogues.</abstract>

The second concerns reasoning by non-intended listeners. When a speaker praises some conversational participant, the remaining participants can make inferences that the speaker criticises what they do not do or behave like the praised participant. The third is schism, which can be often seen in some parties or teaching classes. For example, when a speaker continue to talk an uninteresting story for hours, party attendees split to start to talk neighbours locally. Eggins and Slade (1997) analysed naturallyoccurring dialogues using systemic grammar framework to characterise various aspects of communication such as how attitude is encoded in dialogues, how people negotiate with, and support for and confront against others, and how people establish group membership. By and large, on multi-party dialogues, there are very few studies in computational linguistics and there are several or more researches on multi-party dialogue, which analyse only their example dialogues in discourse analysis.

They used their extension to analyse an excerpt of a conversation between Nixon and his brain trust involving the Watergate scandal. Clark&apos;s contribution graph can be thought of as a reformulation of adjacency pairs and insertion sequences in conversation analysis from the viewpoint that how mutual belief is constructed, and are devoted to the analysis of two-party dialogues. They proposed to include reactions of non-intended listeners as evidence for constructing mutual belief and modify the notation of the contribution graph. Schegloff (1996) pointed out three research topics of multi-party dialogue from the viewpoint of conversation analysis. The first topic involves recipient design. A speaker builds referential expressions for the intended listener to be easily understood, which is related to next speaker selection. The second concerns reasoning by non-intended listeners. When a speaker praises some conversational participant, the remaining participants can make inferences that the speaker criticises what they do not do or behave like the praised participant. The third is schism, which can be often seen in some parties or teach</context>

In the following, firstly, previous research on multi-party dialogues is surveyed. Secondly, our task domain, data collection method, and basic statistics of the collected data are explained. Thirdly, our dialogue coding scheme, coding results and the resultant patterns of information exchanges for two- and multi-party dialogues are shown. Lastly, the patterns of initiative taking behaviour are discussed. 2 Related Studies Sugito and Sawaki (1979) analysed three naturally occurring dialogues to characterise language behaviour of Japanese in shopping situations between a shop assistant and two customers. They relate various characteristics of their dialogue data such as the number of utterances, the types of information exchanges and patterns of initiative taking to the stages or phases of shopping like opening, discussions between customers, clarification by a customer with a shop assistant and closing. Novick and Ward (1993) proposed a computational model to track belief changes of a pilot and an air traffic controller in air traffic </context>

The conclusion here is that two-party interactions are dominant in three-party dialogues. This conclusion holds for our meeting scheduling dialogue data, but intuitively its applicability to other domains seems to be promising, which should obviously need further work. 4.3 Patterns of initiative taking The concept &apos;initiative&apos; is defined by Whittaker and Stenton (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) using a classification of utterance types assertions, commands, questions and prompts.
