ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999787846153846">
Novice users engaged in task-oriented dialogues with an
adviser to learn how to use an unfamiliar statistical
package. The users&apos; task was analyzed and a task
structure was derived. The task structure was used to
segment the dialogue into subdialogues associated with
the subtasks of the overall task. The representation of
the dialogue structure into a hierarchy of subdialogues,
partly corresponding to the task structure, was
validated by three converging analyses. First, the
distribution of non-pronominal noun phrases and the
distribution of pronominal noun phrases exhibited a
pattern consistent with the derived dialogue structure.
Non-pronominal noun phrases occurred more frequently
at the beginning of subdialogues than later, as can be
expected since one of their functions is to indicate topic
shifts. On the other hand, pronominal noun phrases
occurred less frequently in the first sentence of the
subdialogues than in the following sentences of the
subdialogues, as can be expected since they are used to
indicate topic continuity. Second, the distributions of
the antecedents of pronominal noun phrases and of
non-pronominal noun phrases showed a pattern
consistent with the derived dialogue structure. Finally,
distinctive clue words and phrases were found reliably
at the boundaries of subdialogues with different
functions.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.999959090909091">
The goal of this paper is to find evidence for the notion of
dialogue structure as it has been developed in computational
linguistics (Grosz, 1977; Sidner and Grosz, 1985). The role of two
hypothesized determinants of discourse structure will be examined:
1) the structure of the task that the user is trying to accomplish
and the user&apos;s goals and plans arising from the task; 2) the
strategies available to the user when the user is unable to achieve
the task or parts of the task (i.e., meta-plans). The study of
dialogue structures is important because computationally complex
phenomena such as anaphora resolution have been theoretically
linked to the task and dialogue structures.

FOCUSING AND ANAPHORA RESOLUTION
Dialogue Structure: A Key to Computing Focus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975765957447">
Given the computational expense of searching, of inferential
processing, and of semantic consistency checking required to
resolve anaphors, restricting the search a priori to a likely set of
antecedents seems advantageous. The a priori restriction on the
set of potential antecedents for anaphora resolution has been called
focusing (Grosz, 1977; Guindon, 1985; Reichman, 1981; Sidner,
1983). Grosz defines a focus space as that subset of the
participant&apos;s total knowledge that is in the focus of attention and
that is relevant to process a discourse segment.
Task-oriented dialogues are dialogues between conversants
whose goals are to accomplish some specific tasks by exchanging
information through the dialogues. Task-oriented dialogues are
believed to exhibit a structure corresponding to the structure of
the task being performed. The entire dialogue is segmented into
subordinated subdialogues in a manner parallel to the
segmentation of the whole task into subordinated subtasks. Grosz
(1977) assumes that the task hierarchy imposes a hierarchy on the
subdialogue segments. As a subtask of the task is performed (and
its corresponding subdialogue is expressed), the different objects
and actions associated with this subtask come into focus. As this
subtask is completed (and its corresponding subdialogue), its
associated objects and actions leave focus. The task of which the
completed subtask is a part then returns in focus. The
segmentation of a dialogue into interrelated subdialogues is
associated with shifts in focus occurring during the dialogue.
Detailed task structures for each problem given in this study can
be found in Guindon, Sladky, Brunner, and Conner (1986).
A cognitive model of anaphora resolution and focusing is
provided in Guindon (1985) and Kintsch and van Dijk (1978).
Human memory is divided into a short-term memory and a long-
term memory. Short-term memory is divided into a cache and a
buffer. The cache contains items from previous sentences and the
buffer holds the incoming sentence. Short-term memory can only
contain a small number of text items and its retrieval time is fast.
Long-term memory can contain a very large number of text items
but its retrieval time is slow. During the integration of a new
sentence, the T most important and R most recent items in short-
term memory are held over in the cache. Items in focus are the
items in the cache and are more rapidly retrieved. Items not in
focus are items in long-term memory and are more slowly
retrieved. Because the cache contains important items that are
not necessarily recent, pronouns can be used to refer to items that
have been mentioned many sentences back. An empirical study
demonstrates the cognitive basis for focusing, topic shifts, the use
of pronominal noun phrases to refer to antecedents in focus, and
the use of non-pronominal noun phrases to refer to antecedents not
in focus.

Grosz and Sidner (1985) distinguishes three structures in a
discourse structure: 1) the structure of the sequence of utterances,
2) the structure of the intentions conveyed, and 3) the attentional
state. Distinguishing these three structures gives a better account
of discourse phenomena such as boundary markers, anaphors, and
interruptions. This paper will cover mainly the second structure
and will attempt to find evidence linking the dialogue structure to
the task structure. The main point is that the structure of the
intentions conveyed in the discourse should mirror to some extent
the task structure (but see the next section). The first structure of
the dialogue, the structure of the sequence of utterances, will
actually be examined with the pronominal and non-pronominal
noun phrase distributions, the antecedent distribution, and the
boundary marker analyses. We expect that these three analyses
will support the derived dialogue structure, the intentional
structure. The last structure, the attentional structure, is not
discussed here but has been discussed in Guindon (1985).
The main point of &amp;quot;focusing&amp;quot; theories of anaphora resolution
is that the discourse structure, based on the taSk structure, is a
crucial determinant of which discourse entities are held in focus
and are readily accessible for anaphora resolution. Subdialogues
that are in focus are contexts that are used to restrict the search
for antecedents of anaphors.

Task Structure Can Only Partially Determine
Dialogue Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898764705883">
In any case, the task structure can only partially determine
the goals and plans of the novice user and, indirectly, the dialogue
structure. This is because the novice user does not have a good
model of the task and is in the process of building one and because
the adviser only has a partially correct model of what the novice
user knows about the task. The verbal interaction between the
user and the adviser is not just one of execution of plans and
recognition of plans but rather one of situated actions and
detection and repair of imperfect understanding (Suchman,
1985).
As a consequence, the dialogue structures from our data
contained subdialogues that functioned as clarification (i.e.,
request of information) to correct imperfect understanding or as
acknowledgement to verify understanding between the
participants. The notion of meta-plans allows us to account for
the presence of clarification and acknowledgement subdialogues
(see Litman and Allen, 1984).

RESEARCH GOALS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971746478874">
There are many unanswered questions about the nature of
dialogue structures, about the validity and usefulness of the
concept of a dialogue structure, about the role of the task
structure in determining dialogue structure, and in the
contribution of the task structure to focusing and anaphora
resolution. For example, the precise mechanisms to determine the
initial focus and to update it on the basis of the dialogue structure
are still unknown (Sidner, 1983).
The goal of this paper is to find evidence for the validity of
the notion of discourse structure derived from the task structure
by: 1) describing a technique to derive the structure of dialogues
and 2) validating the derived dialogue structure by three
independent converging analyses: a) the distribution of non-
pronominal and pronominal noun phrases b) the distribution of
antecedents of pronominal and non-pronominal anaphors, and c)
the presence of subdialogue boundary markers,
If complete subdialogues get into and out of focus and if
subdialogues are conceived as contexts restricting the set of
antecedents to be searched and tested during anaphora resolution,
identifying the appropriate unit of discourse corresponding to
these subdialogues is crucial.
One phenomenon that should have correspondence to the
dialogue structure is the distribution of non-pronominal and
pronominal noun phrases. Non-pronominal noun phrases can be
used to introduce new entities in the dialogue or to reinstate into
focus a previous dialogue entity out of focus. In other words, non-
pronominal noun phrases are used to indicate topic shifts. As a
consequence, they should tend to occur more frequently at the
beginning of the subdialogues than later in the subdialogues. On
the other hand, pronominal noun phrases are used to refer to
entities currently in focus. In other words, pronominal noun
phrases are used to indicate topic continuity. As a consequence,
they should tend to occur less frequently in the first sentence of a
subdialogue but more frequently in subsequent sentences.
Empirical evidence for these claims are presented in Guindon
(1985). She found that anaphora resolution time is faster for
pronominal noun phrases whose antecedents are in focus than for
those whose antecedents are not in focus. On the other hand, she
found faster anaphora resolution time for non-pronominal noun
phrases whose antecedents were not in focus than for those whose
antecedents were in focus. In other words, the form of the
anaphor signals whether the antecedent is in focus (as when the
anaphor is pronominal) or not in focus (as when the anaphor is
non-pronominal). Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) have made
similar claims about the role of non-pronominal definite noun
phrases and pronominal definite noun phrases.
In linguistics, Clancey (cited in Fox, 1985) found that the use
of definite non-pronominal noun phrases was associated with
episode boundaries. Psychological evidence has shown the special
status in memory for certain sentences in discourse found at the
beginning of paragraphs. Sentences which belong to the
macrostructure (i.e. gist) of the discourse have been shown to be
recognized with more accuracy and faster than sentences belonging
to the microstructure (Guindon and Kintsch, 1984).
Macrostructure sentences are by definition more abstract and
important than microstructure sentences. They express a
summary of the or part of the discourse. The macrostructure
sentences tend to be the first sentences in paragraphs and be
composed of non-pronominal definite noun phrases (van Dijk and
Kinstch, 1983).
Linde (1979) observed the distribution of it and that in
descriptions of houses or apartments. She found that shifts in
focus were associated with change in the room described. The
pronoun it was used to describe objects in focus either associated
with the room then described or to the entire apartment even
when the apartment itself had not been mentioned for many
sentences. The pronoun that was used either to refer to an object
outside the focus or to an object in focus when the description
of the object was in contrast with another description. Grosz
(1977) observed a similar use of the pronoun it in her dialogues to
the use of it in Linde&apos;s dialogues.

<bodyText confidence="0.999742173913044">
In summary, the most important sentences, often at the
beginning of new paragraphs, tend to be composed of full definite
noun phrases. These sentences often introduce a new discourse
entity or reinstate a former one which was out of focus, creating a
topic shift. Sentences which are &amp;quot;subordinated&amp;quot; to the most
important sentence in the paragraph tend to be composed of
pronouns and signal topic continuity.
Another clue to dialogue structures is the distribution of
antecedents of anaphors. Given that pronominals are used to refer
to important or recent concepts (Guindon, 1985), the distribution
of antecedents of pronominal anaphors should cluster in the
current subdialogue (i.e. recency or importance), its parent (i.e.
importance and recency), and the root subdialogue (i.e.
importance). On the other hand, because non-pronominal
anaphors are more informative than pronominal anaphors they
may refer to antecedents that are more widespread in the dialogue,
that is, antecedents that are not as recent or as important.
Another obvious clue is the presence of reliable boundary
markers for different subdialogue types. Some of these markers
have been reported by Grosz (1977), Reichman (1981), and Polanyi
and Scha (1983). The boundary markers found in our
subdialogues should agree with those found in these previous
analyses and extend them.

Derivation of a dialogue structure on the basis
of the task structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993">
An important prerequisite in the interpretation of user-adviser
dialogues is to analyze the task the users are trying to perform. A
task analysis is a detailed description of the determinants of the
user&apos;s behaviors arising from the task context. The first step in
performing task analysis is to identify the objects involved in the
task. In our case, these objects are vectors, matrices, rows,
columns, variables, variable labels, etc. The second step is to
identify all the operators in the task which when applied to one or
more objects changes the state of the completion of the task. In
our case, these operators are function calls (e.g. mean, variance,
sort), subsetting values from vectors, listing of values, etc. Of
course, not every operator applies to every object. A third step is
to identify the sequence of operators which would produce a
desired state (the goal - e.g. the problem solved) from an initial
state. Such a task analysis can be performed at many levels of
abstraction, from high-level conceptual operators to low-level
physical operators. The desired level of abstraction depends upon
the level of abstraction of the behaviors that one wants to account
for. Usually, the more complex or cognitive the task modelled, the
more abstract or coarse the operators selected. In such case, the
operators will reflect the specifics of the task environment, such as,
vectors, matrices, screen, keyboard. The finer the grain of
analysis, the more the operators are associated with basic motor,
perceptual, or cognitive mechanisms. Since the task we are trying
to model is quite cognitive in nature - solving statistical problems
with an unfamiliar statistical package - an appropriate level of
analysis seems to be at the level of the so-called GOMS model
(Card, Moran, and Newell, 1983). GOMS stands for: (1) a set of
Goals; 2) a set of Operators; 3) a set of Methods for achieving the
goals; 4) a set of Selection rules for choosing among competing
methods for goals.
In the notation used in our examples, we have used a slightly
different terminology and have used the term action instead of
operator and use the term plan instead of method. We have also
used the terms prerequisites, constraints, and meta-plans from
artificial intelligence. The notion of meta-plans allowed us to
account for the presence of clarification and acknowledgement
subdialogues (see Litman and Allen, 1984) that could not be
accounted directly by the task structure.
We will now describe how the task structure was used in
deriving the dialogue structure. Goal or plan subordination arises
from the plan decomposition into subplans or from unsatisfied
prerequisites. In a task structure, plans are composed of other
plans themselves, leading to a hierarchical structure. In other
words, a subgoal to a goal can arise from a plan decomposition
into subplans or from the prerequisite conditions which must hold
true before applying the plan. Here are the coding decisions used
in deriving the dialogue structure:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.898117538461538">
• If the user initiated a subdialogue consisting of the
statement of a plan or of a goal, the subdialogue would
be &amp;quot;inserted&amp;quot; in the task structure at the location of
the plan described.
• If the user initiated a subdialogue consisting of the
statement of a subplan within the decomposition of its
parent plan, the subdialogue would be &amp;quot;inserted&amp;quot; in
the appropriate daughter subplan of the parent plan in
the task structure.
• If the user initiated a subdialogue consisting of a
subplan arising from an unsatisfied prerequisite of a
plan, then the subdialogue would be &amp;quot;inserted&amp;quot; as a
daughter of the subdialogue associated with the plan.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997546769230769">
Clarification subdialogues arise from the restrictions on the
meta-plans that the participants can use when they cannot
achieve one of their plans: In our study, they must ask help to the
adviser aloud. The meta-plan, ASK-ADVISER-HELP, itself has
prerequisites, one of them being that the linguistic communication
be successful. This leads to the linguistic clarification subdialogues
that occur when there are ambiguities in the message that need to
be resolved by requesting disambiguating information from the
adviser. Another consequence of the meta-plan ASK-ADVISER-
HELP is the presence of acknowledgement subdialogues
whereby participants ensure that the communication is successful
by acknowledging that they have understood the message.
Let&apos;s continue describing the coding scheme:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995883545454545">
• The clarification subdialogues are subordinated to the
subdialogue mentioning the concept for which
clarification is requested (e.g., goal, plan, term).
• The acknowledgement subdialogues are subordinated to
the subdialogue mentioning the acknowledged concept.
• The linguistic clarification subdialogues are also
subordinated to the subdialogue containing the
utterance for which clarification is requested.
• Since we are not fully modeling the user&apos;s task,
subdialogues regarding the participants&apos; behaviors as a
subject in a study were ignored.

• Since knowing the required statistical formula and
knowing how to use the console were required to solve
all the problems, these prerequisites were not always
encoded explicitly in the task structure. Nevertheless,
the clarification and acknowledgement subdialogues
regarding statistics and the use of the console were
subordinated to the subdialogue associated with the
plan for which these clarifications were necessary to
obtain.

Three novice users had basic knowledge of statistics. They
had to use an unfamiliar statistical package to solve five simple
descriptive statistics problems. There were two main restrictions
imposed on the strategies employed to solve the problems: 1) the
only source of information was the adviser; 2) all requests for
information had to be said aloud. These restrictions were
considered as restrictions on the meta-plans available to the
participants when unable to solve the problems. The participant,
the adviser sitting to his/her right, and the console were
videotaped.

Coding of the Dialogues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999924035714286">
Each subdialogue was segmented into subdialogues which
appeared to be the execution of a plan to satisfy a goal of the user
or the adviser on the basis of the task structure.
In addition to segmenting the dialogue into subdialogues, the
relations between subdialogues were determined. One source of
such relations is the decomposition of a total task into subtasks to
be performed in some order. This decomposition is called the task
structure (see Grosz, 1977) as described previously. Two
important relations are subordination and enablement.
Consider a dialogue occurring while performing a task, such as
baking a cake, composed of three subtasks, (1) measure
ingredients, (2) mix ingredients, (3) put the mixed ingredients in
the oven. Subtasks 1, 2, and 3 are said to be subordinated to
the task of baking a cake. Moreover, subtask 2 must precede
subtask 3. Subtask 2 is said to enable subtask 3. The
subdialogues that would be instrumental to the execution of these
subtasks would stand in the same relations.
However, the decomposition of the task structure was not the
only source of subordination and enablement relations between
subdialogues. Clarification and acknowledgement subdialogues
even though they did not correspond to a subtask in the task
structure were subordinated to the subdialogue introducing the
clarified and acknowledged concept respectively.
The coder then analyzed the distribution of non-pronominal
noun phrases and pronominal noun phrases throughout the
dialogue. The coder also noted words and phrases occurring at the
boundaries of the subdialogues and mapped the distribution of the
antecedents of pronominal and non-pronominal anaphors.

ANALYSIS OF THE DIALOGUES
ANALYSIS OF THE USERS&apos; TASK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992985">
Three main types of subdialogues have been encountered
associated with each aspect of the task described above :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.974773037037037">
1. Plan-goal statement subdialogues occur when the
user describes a goal, or a plan, or the execution of
actions composing the plan This type of subdialogue
may be an adjunct to the goal or plan because
expressing them verbally might not be essential for
their satisfaction or realization (though expressing
them verbally helps the adviser understand the user).
2. Clarification subdialogues occur when the user
requests information from the adviser so that the user
can satisfy a goal. In this study, these subdialogues
arise from the constraints on the type of meta-plans
available, ASK-ADVISER-HELP. There are two main
types of clarification subdialogues: 1) those concerning
the determination of goals and plans of the user
(e.g., &amp;quot;What should I do next?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How do I access a
vector?&amp;quot;); 2) those concerning the arguments (or
objects) in goals and plans (e.g., &amp;quot;What is a
vector?&amp;quot;). In some cases, the clarification subdialogues
arise from the prerequisite on the meta-plan, that is,
assure mutual understanding. For example, the user
will verify that he/she has identified the correct
referent for an anaphor in the adviser&apos;s utterances.
3. Acknowledgement subdialogues occur when the
user informs the adviser that he/she believes that
he/she has understood an explanation. They arise from
the prerequisite on the meta-plan, that is, assure
mutual understanding.

DISTRIBUTION OF NON-PRONOMINAL
AND PRONOMINAL NOUN PHRASES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999743476190476">
Non-pronominal noun phrases play a role in indicating and
realizing topic shifts in a dialogue. Since new subdialogues are
assumed to correspond to topic shifts, one can predict that non-
pronominal noun phrases will tend to occur more frequently at the
beginning of subdialogues than later in the subdialogues. On the
other hand, pronominal noun phrases play a role in indicating and
realizing topic continuity in a dialogue. Since new topics are
introduced at the beginning of new subdialogues and developed in
the following sentences, one can predict that pronominal noun
phrases will tend to occur more frequently after the first sentence
in the subdialogues. As can be seen in Table 1, there is a clear
trend for the number of non-pronominal noun phrases to decrease
as the subdialogue progresses, especially for the most frequent
subdialogue lengths (i.e., 2 and 3 sentences), but less marked for
the most infrequent subdialogue lengths (i.e., 4 and 5 sentences).
Moreover, there is a clear increase in the number of pronominal
noun phrases from the first sentence to the second sentence in the
subdialogues, though again less reliable for the least frequent
subdialgue lengths (i.e.-, 4 and 5 sentences). A complete statistical
analysis of these data is presented in Guindon, Sladky, Brunner,
and Conner (1986).

The observed distributions of non-pronominal and pronominal
noun phrases follow the predictions arising from previous work in
linguistics and psychology. Because this analysis was performed
independently of the dialogue segmentation and subordination, it
is a converging analysis and it supports the derived dialogue
structure on the basis of the task structure and the users&apos; and
adviser&apos;s plans and goals. This analysis supports the value of the
concept of a dialogue structure and also support our proposed

The subdialogues were indexed as shown in Table 2. The

node N-2 dominates N-1, and so on. The nodes subordinate to
each of the nodes dominating N are indexed beginning with the

Pronominal anaphors are used to refer to discourse entities
that are in focus. Such entities should be either recent or of
primary importance in the dialogue. Figure 2 represents
graphically the distribution of the antecedents of pronominal noun
phrases with a band, with highest frequencies shown with the
widest bands. For sake of brevity, the exact frequencies are not
reported here but can be found in Guindon, Sladky, Brunner, and

Figure 2. shows that the majority of pronominal antecedents
are located in the current subdialogue, with their frequency
decreasing as distance from the anaphor increases. The current
subdialogue contains recent antecedents. Then, they are most
frequently found in the parent subdialogue which contains
important and recent antecedents. Finally, a few pronominal
anaphors (i.e. it) have their antecedent (i.e., the statistical
package) found in the root subdialogue which contains important
antecedents. Grosz (1977) also observed the use of it to refer to an
important concept that had not been mentioned for many
sentences. These data demonstrate the existence of constraints at
the dialogue level on the distribution of the antecedents of

These data strongly suggest that recency plays a role within
the current subdialogue, but also that another factor must be
invoked to explain the high frequency of antecedents observed in
N-1 and in the root subdialogue. This other factor is topicality
or importance (Guindon, 1985; Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978).
A parent subdialogue describes information that is important
to the information described in a subordinate subdialogue.
Moreover, the antecedent statistical package was located at the
&amp;quot;root&amp;quot; subdialogue of the dialogue structure. In other words, it
was one of the most important concepts mentioned in the dialogue
and because of its importance stayed in the user&apos;s and adviser&apos;s
short-term memory during the complete dialogue and could be
referred to by using a pronoun. The allocation of short-term
memory during discourse comprehension corresponds to the
concept of attentional state (Grosz and Sidner, 1985) and is
described in more detail in Guindon (1985).
The task structure and the user&apos;s meta-plans correspond to the
intentional structure described by Grosz and Sidner (1985). Note
that the segmentation of the task into subtasks direct the
segmentation of the dialogue into subdialogues and is also a
determinant of focus shifts and the attentional state. The
antecedent distribution for pronominal anaphors is consistent with
the dialogue structure derived from the user&apos;s plans and goals and
describe principled and psychologically valid constraints on the use
of pronominal anaphors over an extended dialogue. As a
consequence, the validity of the derived dialogue structure is
increased.

Selecting the proper antecedent for a non-pronominal definite
noun phrase anaphor is less difficult than for pronominal anaphor
since more semantic information is provided for matching the
description of the antecedent. For this reason we would expect the
distribution for antecedents of non-pronominal definite noun
phrases to be far less constrained than the distribution for
pronominal noun phrases. Figure 2 shows that this is the case.
Definite noun phrase antecedents range over every dominant node
N-1 through N-5 and over a few left-branching subordinate nodes.
Nevertheless, there is a strong tendency for antecedents to be
locally positioned in N and N-1. Their distribution is consistent
with the derived dialogue structure on the basis of an analysis of
the task and an analysis of the users&apos; and adviser&apos;s plans and
goals.

three major types of subdialogues: 1) plan-goal statement; 2)
clarification; 3) acknowledgement. Acknowledgement subdialogues

acting as closing boundary markers for clarification subdialogues.

The boundary markers are part of the linguistic structure of
dialogue, and so is the distribution of the non-pronominal and
pronominal noun phrases. Both analyses are consistent with the
derived dialogue structure on the basis of the task structure and
the users&apos; and adviser&apos;s plans and goals and they increase the
validity of the derived dialogue structure. Both analyses also show
that shifts in focus during discourse comprehension can be
signalled in the surface form of the conversants&apos; utterances. As a

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987846153846">
Three independent converging analyses support the dialogue
structure derived on the basis of the task structure and the users&apos;
and adviser&apos;s plans and goals. The distribution of the non-
pronominal noun phrases shows that they occur more frequently at
the beginning of subdialogues than later in the subdialogues, as
should be expected if non-pronominal noun phrases introduce new
entities in the dialogue or reinstate previous ones. The
distribution of the pronominal noun phrases show that they occur
less frequently in the first sentence than in the second sentence of
the dialogue, as can be expected if they act as indicator of topic
continuity. The distribution of pronominal antecedents shows that
speakers are sensitive to the organization of a dialogue into a
hierarchical structure composed of goal-oriented subdialogues.
Antecedents of pronominal noun phrases tend to occur in the
current subdialogue, in its parent, or in the root subdialogue. In
particular, concepts mentioned in the current subdialogue, its
parent, or in the root subdialogue tend to be in focus. In the case
of non-pronominal definite noun phrase anaphors, while it is
possible for antecedents to be much more widely spread across the
dialogue, they also tend to be located in the current subdialogue or
its parent. As a consequence, it would be possible to restrict and
order the search for the antecedents of pronominal and non-
pronominal definite noun phrases on the basis of the type of
dialogue structure exemplified in this paper. The analysis of
boundary markers reveals reliable and distinctive surface linguistic
markers for different types of subdialogues.

The notion of a dialogue structure based on the task structure
has been empirically supported. The notion of focusing and its
relation to the segmentation of the dialogue into subdialogues has
also been supported, especially by the antecedent distribution of
the pronominal and non-pronominal noun phrases. The results of
Guindon (1985) showing different anaphora resolution times for
different types of anaphors with antecedent in or out of focus also
support the &amp;quot;focusing&amp;quot; theories of anaphora resolution. This gives
an impetus to include a model of the dialogue structure and a
focusing mechanism in natural language interfaces. However,
much further work has to be done to define precisely how the
dialogue structure could be computed from the task structure and
the meta-plans of the conversants and how precisely the anaphora
resolution process would capitalize on this structure.

On the other hand, she found faster anaphora resolution time for non-pronominal noun phrases whose antecedents were not in focus than for those whose antecedents were in focus. In other words, the form of the anaphor signals whether the antecedent is in focus (as when the anaphor is pronominal) or not in focus (as when the anaphor is non-pronominal). Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) have made similar claims about the role of non-pronominal definite noun phrases and pronominal definite noun phrases. In linguistics, Clancey (cited in Fox, 1985) found that the use of definite non-pronominal noun phrases was associated with episode boundaries. Psychological evidence has shown the special status in memory for certain sentences in discourse found at the beginning of paragraphs. Sentences which belong to the macrostructure (i.e. gist) of the discourse have been shown to be recognized with more accuracy and faster than sentences belonging to the microstructure (Guindon and Kintsch, 1984). Macrostructure sentences are by definition more abstract and important than microstructure sentences. They express a summary of the or part of the disco</context>

Finally, distinctive clue words and phrases were found reliably at the boundaries of subdialogues with different functions. INTRODUCTION The goal of this paper is to find evidence for the notion of dialogue structure as it has been developed in computational linguistics (Grosz, 1977; Sidner and Grosz, 1985). The role of two hypothesized determinants of discourse structure will be examined: 1) the structure of the task that the user is trying to accomplish and the user&apos;s goals and plans arising from the task; 2) the strategies available to the user when the user is unable to achieve the task or parts of the task (i.e., meta-plans). The study of dialogue structures is important because computationally complex phenomena such as anaphora resolution have been theoretically linked to the task and dialogue structures. FOCUSING AND ANAPHORA RESOLUTION Dialogue Structure: A Key t</context>
<context position="3394" citStr="Grosz (1977)" startWordPosition="506" endWordPosition="507">83). Grosz defines a focus space as that subset of the participant&apos;s total knowledge that is in the focus of attention and that is relevant to process a discourse segment. Task-oriented dialogues are dialogues between conversants whose goals are to accomplish some specific tasks by exchanging information through the dialogues. Task-oriented dialogues are believed to exhibit a structure corresponding to the structure of the task being performed. The entire dialogue is segmented into subordinated subdialogues in a manner parallel to the segmentation of the whole task into subordinated subtasks. Grosz (1977) assumes that the task hierarchy imposes a hierarchy on the subdialogue segments. As a subtask of the task is performed (and its corresponding subdialogue is expressed), the different objects and actions associated with this subtask come into focus. As this subtask is completed (and its corresponding subdialogue), its associated objects and actions leave focus. The task of which the completed subtask is a part then returns in focus. The segmentation of a dialogue into interrelated subdialogues is associated with shifts in focus occurring during the dialogue. Detailed task structures for each p</context>

Linde (1979) observed the distribution of it and that in descriptions of houses or apartments. She found that shifts in focus were associated with change in the room described. The pronoun it was used to describe objects in focus either associated with the room then described or to the entire apartment even when the apartment itself had not been mentioned for many sentences. The pronoun that was used either to refer to an object outside the focus or to an object in focus when the description of the object was in contrast with another description. Grosz (1977) observed a similar use of the pronoun it in her dialogues to the use of it in Linde&apos;s dialogues. 225 In summary, the most important sentences, often at the beginning of new paragraphs, tend to be composed of full definite noun phrases. These sentences often introduce a new discourse entity or reinstate a former one which was out of focus, creating a topic shift. Sentences which are &amp;quot;subordinated&amp;quot; to the most important sentence in the paragraph tend to be composed of pronouns and signal topic continuity. Another clue to dialogue structures is the distribution of antecedents of anaphors. Given </context>
<context position="13225" citStr="Grosz (1977)" startWordPosition="2055" endWordPosition="2056">indon, 1985), the distribution of antecedents of pronominal anaphors should cluster in the current subdialogue (i.e. recency or importance), its parent (i.e. importance and recency), and the root subdialogue (i.e. importance). On the other hand, because non-pronominal anaphors are more informative than pronominal anaphors they may refer to antecedents that are more widespread in the dialogue, that is, antecedents that are not as recent or as important. Another obvious clue is the presence of reliable boundary markers for different subdialogue types. Some of these markers have been reported by Grosz (1977), Reichman (1981), and Polanyi and Scha (1983). The boundary markers found in our subdialogues should agree with those found in these previous analyses and extend them. Derivation of a dialogue structure on the basis of the task structure An important prerequisite in the interpretation of user-adviser dialogues is to analyze the task the users are trying to perform. A task analysis is a detailed description of the determinants of the user&apos;s behaviors arising from the task context. The first step in performing task analysis is to identify the objects involved in the task. In our case, these obj</context>

The participant, the adviser sitting to his/her right, and the console were videotaped. Coding of the Dialogues Each subdialogue was segmented into subdialogues which appeared to be the execution of a plan to satisfy a goal of the user or the adviser on the basis of the task structure. In addition to segmenting the dialogue into subdialogues, the relations between subdialogues were determined. One source of such relations is the decomposition of a total task into subtasks to be performed in some order. This decomposition is called the task structure (see Grosz, 1977) as described previously. Two important relations are subordination and enablement. Consider a dialogue occurring while performing a task, such as baking a cake, composed of three subtasks, (1) measure ingredients, (2) mix ingredients, (3) put the mixed ingredients in the oven. Subtasks 1, 2, and 3 are said to be subordinated to the task of baking a cake. Moreover, subtask 2 must precede subtask 3. Subtask 2 is said to enable subtask 3. The subdialogues that would be instrumental to the execution of these subtasks would stand in the same relations. However, the decomposition of the task struct</context>

Figure 2. shows that the majority of pronominal antecedents are located in the current subdialogue, with their frequency decreasing as distance from the anaphor increases. The current subdialogue contains recent antecedents. Then, they are most frequently found in the parent subdialogue which contains important and recent antecedents. Finally, a few pronominal anaphors (i.e. it) have their antecedent (i.e., the statistical package) found in the root subdialogue which contains important antecedents. Grosz (1977) also observed the use of it to refer to an important concept that had not been mentioned for many sentences. These data demonstrate the existence of constraints at the dialogue level on the distribution of the antecedents of ANTECEDENT DISTRIBUTION Frequent Unfrequern Figure 2: ANTECEDENT DISTRIBUTION pronominal anaphors: most antecedents are located in the current subdialogue or in its immediate superordinate and a few antecedents co-specifying the main topic(s) of the dialogue are located at the root of the dialogue.

FOCUSING AND ANAPHORA RESOLUTION Dialogue Structure: A Key to Computing Focus Given the computational expense of searching, of inferential processing, and of semantic consistency checking required to resolve anaphors, restricting the search a priori to a likely set of antecedents seems advantageous. The a priori restriction on the set of potential antecedents for anaphora resolution has been called focusing (Grosz, 1977; Guindon, 1985; Reichman, 1981; Sidner, 1983).

As this subtask is completed (and its corresponding subdialogue), its associated objects and actions leave focus. The task of which the completed subtask is a part then returns in focus. The segmentation of a dialogue into interrelated subdialogues is associated with shifts in focus occurring during the dialogue. Detailed task structures for each problem given in this study can be found in Guindon, Sladky, Brunner, and Conner (1986). A cognitive model of anaphora resolution and focusing is provided in Guindon (1985) and Kintsch and van Dijk (1978). Human memory is divided into a short-term memory and a longterm memory. Short-term memory is divided into a cache and a buffer. The cache contains items from previous sentences and the buffer holds the incoming sentence. Short-term memory can only contain a small number of text items and its retrieval time is fast. Long-term memory can contain a very large number of text items but its retrieval time is slow. During the integration of a new sentence, the T most important and R most recent items in shortterm memory are held over in the cache. Items in focus are </context>

The main point is that the structure of the intentions conveyed in the discourse should mirror to some extent the task structure (but see the next section). The first structure of the dialogue, the structure of the sequence of utterances, will actually be examined with the pronominal and non-pronominal noun phrase distributions, the antecedent distribution, and the boundary marker analyses. We expect that these three analyses will support the derived dialogue structure, the intentional structure. The last structure, the attentional structure, is not discussed here but has been discussed in Guindon (1985). The main point of &amp;quot;focusing&amp;quot; theories of anaphora resolution is that the discourse structure, based on the taSk structure, is a crucial determinant of which discourse entities are held in focus and are readily accessible for anaphora resolution. Subdialogues that are in focus are contexts that are used to restrict the search for antecedents of anaphors. Task Structure Can Only Partially Determine Dialogue Structure In any case, the task structure can only partially determine the goals and plans of the novice user and, indirectly, the dialogue structure. This is because the novice user does n</context>

As a consequence, they should tend to occur more frequently at the beginning of the subdialogues than later in the subdialogues. On the other hand, pronominal noun phrases are used to refer to entities currently in focus. In other words, pronominal noun phrases are used to indicate topic continuity. As a consequence, they should tend to occur less frequently in the first sentence of a subdialogue but more frequently in subsequent sentences. Empirical evidence for these claims are presented in Guindon (1985). She found that anaphora resolution time is faster for pronominal noun phrases whose antecedents are in focus than for those whose antecedents are not in focus. On the other hand, she found faster anaphora resolution time for non-pronominal noun phrases whose antecedents were not in focus than for those whose antecedents were in focus. In other words, the form of the anaphor signals whether the antecedent is in focus (as when the anaphor is pronominal) or not in focus (as when the anaphor is non-pronominal). Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) have made similar claims about the role of non-pro</context>

These sentences often introduce a new discourse entity or reinstate a former one which was out of focus, creating a topic shift. Sentences which are &amp;quot;subordinated&amp;quot; to the most important sentence in the paragraph tend to be composed of pronouns and signal topic continuity. Another clue to dialogue structures is the distribution of antecedents of anaphors. Given that pronominals are used to refer to important or recent concepts (Guindon, 1985), the distribution of antecedents of pronominal anaphors should cluster in the current subdialogue (i.e. recency or importance), its parent (i.e. importance and recency), and the root subdialogue (i.e. importance). On the other hand, because non-pronominal anaphors are more informative than pronominal anaphors they may refer to antecedents that are more widespread in the dialogue, that is, antecedents that are not as recent or as important. Another obvious clue is the presence of reliable boundary markers for different subdialogue types. Some of these markers have been reported by Grosz (1977)</context>
<context position="28441" citStr="Guindon, 1985" startWordPosition="4483" endWordPosition="4484">pronominal anaphors: most antecedents are located in the current subdialogue or in its immediate superordinate and a few antecedents co-specifying the main topic(s) of the dialogue are located at the root of the dialogue.

This other factor is topicality or importance (Guindon, 1985; Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978). A parent subdialogue describes information that is important to the information described in a subordinate subdialogue. Moreover, the antecedent statistical package was located at the &amp;quot;root&amp;quot; subdialogue of the dialogue structure. In other words, it was one of the most important concepts mentioned in the dialogue and because of its importance stayed in the user&apos;s and adviser&apos;s short-term memory during the complete dialogue and could be referred to by using a pronoun. The allocation of short-term memory during discourse comprehension corresponds to the concept of a</context>

Sentences which belong to the macrostructure (i.e. gist) of the discourse have been shown to be recognized with more accuracy and faster than sentences belonging to the microstructure (Guindon and Kintsch, 1984). Macrostructure sentences are by definition more abstract and important than microstructure sentences. They express a summary of the or part of the discourse. The macrostructure sentences tend to be the first sentences in paragraphs and be composed of non-pronominal definite noun phrases (van Dijk and Kinstch, 1983).

The verbal interaction between the user and the adviser is not just one of execution of plans and recognition of plans but rather one of situated actions and detection and repair of imperfect understanding (Suchman, 1985). As a consequence, the dialogue structures from our data contained subdialogues that functioned as clarification (i.e., request of information) to correct imperfect understanding or as acknowledgement to verify understanding between the participants. The notion of meta-plans allows us to account for the presence of clarification and acknowledgement subdialogues (see Litman and Allen, 1984). RESEARCH GOALS There are many unanswered questions about the nature of dialogue structures, about the validity and usefulness of the concept of a dialogue structure, about the role of the task structure in determining dialogue structure, and in the contribution of the task structure to focusing and anaphora resolution. For example, the precise mechanisms to determine the initial focus and to update it on the basis of the dialogue structure are still unknown (Sidner, 1983).

GOMS stands for: (1) a set of Goals; 2) a set of Operators; 3) a set of Methods for achieving the goals; 4) a set of Selection rules for choosing among competing methods for goals. In the notation used in our examples, we have used a slightly different terminology and have used the term action instead of operator and use the term plan instead of method. We have also used the terms prerequisites, constraints, and meta-plans from artificial intelligence. The notion of meta-plans allowed us to account for the presence of clarification and acknowledgement subdialogues (see Litman and Allen, 1984) that could not be accounted directly by the task structure. We will now describe how the task structure was used in deriving the dialogue structure. Goal or plan subordination arises from the plan decomposition into subplans or from unsatisfied prerequisites. In a task structure, plans are composed of other plans themselves, leading to a hierarchical structure. In other words, a subgoal to a goal can arise from a plan decomposition into subplans or from the prerequisite conditions which must hold true before applying the plan. Here are the coding decisions used in deriving the dialogue struct</context>
