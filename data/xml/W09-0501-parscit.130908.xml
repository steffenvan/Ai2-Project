This article is concerned with Extreme Case
Formulations (ECFs) (Edwards, 2000;
Pomerantz, 1986) in spontaneous Cypriot
Greek conversations.1 This study confirms
the occurrence of ECFs in complaints as
identified by Edwards (2000) Pomerantz
(1986), but goes one step further to analyse
the sequential and interaction work
accomplished with ECFs in reporting
“opposition-type stories” (Schegloff, 1984)
and in complaining about a non-present
party’s misbehaviour. Opposition-type
stories report the oppositional conversation
of the teller with a third non-present party
(id.). Interestingly, in the conversational
extracts examined in this study, the
conversation reported is culminated with the
opponent’s reported extreme claim (ECF)
occupying the last turn. The occurrence of an
ECF at that marked place, that is, at the
punchline of the telling, is associated with
issues of affiliation and stance since it is
placed exactly before the recipient’s slot
upon story completion, which is a regular
place for the occurrence of evaluation
(Schegloff, 1984).

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.968039551724138">
1 Cyprus is an independent island republic in the
Eastern Mediterranean. Data from the 2001 census of
population showed that on 1st October 2001 the total
population of the Cyprus Republic was 689,565
composed of 89.7% Greek Cypriots, 0.2% Armenian,
0.5% Maronites, 0.04% Cypriots of European origin
called “Latins” and 0.05% Turkish Cypriots; 0.1%
did not declare their ethnic religious group (Census of
Population 2001); the remainder being foreigners
from Europe and Asia. The Greek speech community
in Cyprus is defined as diglossic. Diglossia in Cyprus
refers to the simultaneous use of the dialect (Cypriot
Greek dialect, CD) and the demotic Greek (Modern
Greek, MG).
This article reports some of the findings of a
study of extreme case formulations (ECFs)
(Edwards, 2000; Pomerantz, 1986) in
spontaneous conversations exclusively
conducted in Cypriot Greek.
In a seminal article, Pomerantz (1986) drew
attention to the conversational uses of extreme
case formulations (ECFs). Edwards (2000: 347-
8) explains that ECFs are “descriptions or
assessments that deploy extreme expressions
such as every, all, none, best, least, as good as it
gets, always, perfectly, brand new, and
absolutely”. Pomerantz (1986: 219-220)
summarizes the three main uses of ECFs, mainly
used in complaints, in the following way:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975500833333333">
(1) to assert the strongest case in
anticipation of non-sympathetic
hearings,
(2) to propose the cause of a phenomenon,
(3) to speak for the rightness (wrongness) of
a practice.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999585470588235">
Pomerantz’s (1986) three uses of ECFs are
basically oppositional and argumentative,
occurring in environments where descriptions
and assessments are being strengthened or
resisted. As Edwards (2000) showed this applies
to his counselling data (1995) too, where wife
and husband produce and defend opposed
versions of facts. In this data a lot of ECFs
follow the same sequential pattern of “ECF-
challenge-softener”. Although Pomerantz (1986)
did not pursue post-ECF talk, she noted the
challenge after an ECF.
However, as Edwards notes (2000: 360), ECFs
can also occur in affiliative sequences as
“upgrades and displays of affiliation being done,
of agreement being full and so on” –as in
Pomerantz’s (1984) demonstration of how

upgraded “second assessments” display
agreement. ECFs make excellent upgrades (id.).
Added to this role, ECFs might be treated by
participants as “indexing the speaker’s stance or
attitude”, what Edwards calls “investments”
(op.cit.: 363-4). As Edwards explains (id.)
denying or insisting on something in an extreme
way can highlight the action of denying or
insisting, as a kind of stance or attitude (cf.
Edwards &amp; Potter, 1992; Potter 1996). Finally,
Edwards (2000: 365) draws attention to the
“nonliteral or metaphoric uses of ECFs” used in
actions of exaggerating, teasing, ironizing,
emphasizing, joking etc.

2 Data and Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99950241509434">
The study of ECFs investigated in this work is
based on recordings of informal, spontaneous,
face-to-face conversations among close friends
or relatives. These are exclusively conducted in
Cypriot Greek. The conversations transcribed for
the present study are part of a collection of
recordings that took place between December
1998 and April 2003. They comprise
transcriptions of 35 hours of tape-recorded
natural interactions produced by young native
Cypriot Greek speakers during a variety of
gatherings or occasions, e.g. dinner, gathering
for coffee in friends’ houses etc. The extracts
included in this article comprise transcriptions of
approximately 3 hour. The recordings consist of
same sex conversations among women.2
The method that is adopted in the analysis of the
data is Conversation Analysis (CA), which has
its origins in the pioneering work in the sixties
by the sociologist Harvey Sacks (1992a, 1992b).
First and foremost, conversation analysis has
focused its analytical attention on “recorded,
naturally occurring talk-in-interaction” (Hutchby
and Wooffitt, 1998: 14). These recordings of
actual speech are transcribed using a system
which is intended to capture in detail the
characteristics “of the sequencing of turns,
including gaps, pauses and overlaps; and the
2 ECFs were also identified in a set of data collected
during 2007 in conversations among young men. The
transcription revealed use of ECFs as upgraded
assessments and in actions of joking and
exaggerating. Interestingly, no use of ECF in
complaints was found.
element of speech delivery such as audible
breath and laughter, stress, enunciation,
intonation and pitch” (Hutchby and Drew, 1995:
182).
The transcription symbols used in this study are
based on the transcription conventions
developed by Jefferson for the analysis of
conversational turns in English conversation (see
Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson, 1974) and are
adopted in the form presented by Ochs,
Schegloff and Thompson (1996) and Clift
(1999). The relevant transcription symbols for
this study are cited in appendix I.
The phonetic inventory used for reading
transcription is based on the International
Phonetic Association [IPA] which is adjusted to
the Greek language by Nespor (1999) and on the
phonetic inventory of Cypriot Greek presented
and described by Newton (1972).

3 ECFs in Cypriot Greek
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995630517241379">
My data of spontaneous Cypriot-Greek
conversations confirms Edwards’s (2000) and
Pomerantz’s claim (1986) of the use of ECFs in
making complaints.
In particular, this study reports a pattern of the
sequential and interactional position of ECFs
found in the reporting of “opposition-type
stories” (Schegloff, 1984) and in complaining
about a non-present party’s misbehaviour. In the
conversations examined here, complaining is
expressed with the narration of two-party
opposition-type stories in which the teller is one
of the two parties involved. In particular,
opposition-type stories are reported using the
BCBC format, B being the teller and C his/her
opponent. Thus, that BCBC format tracks not
only the alternation of the turns but also the
alternation of positions. This formula turns out to
have C’s position be the one occupying the last
turn (Schegloff, 1984). By “reproducing the
“original” utterance or utterances, speakers can
provide access to the interaction being discussed,
enabling the recipient to assess it for himself.
Supplying this kind of evidence is important
when.....a complaint is made about someone
based on what they said” (Holt, 1996: 229).
It seems that the basic feature attributed to
opposition type stories is that they are more
than any other form of storytelling “recipient
</bodyText>

designed” (Sacks, 1971: 453). If this is so, it
means that tellers design the storytelling with
an orientation to the specific recipients in order
to elicit their affiliative siding. In the fragments
under study where the teller is one of the
opposing parties, it is obviously important for
the teller to transmit to her recipients the
correctness or appropriateness of her position
and the incorrectness or inappropriateness of
her opponent’s position. In these extracts the
teller invests special effort in constructing the
contrast between herself and her opponent in
two interrelated ways. Therefore, this is
accomplished by narrating an opposition-type
story based on the conversation she had with
the opponent and by reporting the activities of
the opponent parties which proposes the
significance of the upcoming reported speech.
Each story culminates in a report of the other’s
speech. The motivation for the reporting of
speech and activities is grounded in
considerations of affiliation and stance.
Actually in the conversations examined in this
paper the oppositional story has its punchline in
the reporting of an ECF attributed to the third
non-present party. One thing the recipient can do
is to side with one or the other, that is,
teller/protagonist or his/her opponent. Usually
recipients side with tellers because this is how
tellers choose their story recipients (Schegloff,
1984). In the cases here the reported ECF is
responded to with a challenge taking the form of
rhetorical question, extreme case formulation,
idiomatic expression or ironic evaluation. Stories
involve extended single turns at talk (Sacks,
1968: 18). The storytelling sequence is
composed “of three serially ordered and
adjacently placed types of sequences”: “the
preface, the telling, and the response sequences”
(Sacks, 1974: My main interest is in the
punchline and the recipient’s slot upon story
completion.
Due to the limit of space, I present only two
representative examples of the use ECF in
the punchline of opposition-type stories as
shown in the extract 1 and 2 that follow.

In extract 1 above the complaining proceeds as
follows: the teller is reporting the complainable
behavior of her opponent through reporting her
transgressions (1: 9-10, 12-13, 15-16) and then
continues with the reporting of the oppositional
exchange (1: 20, 25-33) between her and her
opponent which follows the BCBC format.
The oppositional exchange culminates in a
piece of formulaic-sounding wisdom proffered
by the mother (1: 32-33: “only when you
become a mother will you understand”) which
is hearable as an “extra-ordinary” claim
(Pomerantz, 1986) framed as such based on the
use of the ECF “only” followed with the
idiomatic expression “when you become a
mother will you understand”. According to
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.965099394736842">
Torode, “an extreme case is designed to close
an argument. As such it is vulnerable to
attempts at refutation” (1996: 10). Thus, the
placement of that extraordinary claim at the
climax of the story should be seen in relation
to motivations of eliciting affiliation. In other
words the teller offers to the recipient an
extreme claim in order to elicit a refutation of
that claim. The reporting of the opponent’s
words effected by intonation, as it is shown in
the stress in voice and the louder tone, serves
to detach the teller from commitment with
these words. In 1: 34 the recipient challenges
the mother’s exaggerative claim with a
rhetorical question “oh rea::lly?”. In agreement
with Schegloff’s claim, the suggested response
gets heard as a slot in the oppositional
conversation reported by the teller because it
comes off “as a proposed piece” of the teller’s
argument (1984: 46-47). The shift of footing
(Goffman, 1979) from the mother’s reported
extreme claim to the rhetorical question frames
(Goffman, 1974) the evaluation as irony.
The following extract also serves to illustrate
the point shown with extract 1 about the
occurrence of ECF at the climax of an
oppositional story.

In extract (2) the teller announces that the
complaint is about something the other (Lina)
said to her (2: 1-2) and starts reporting the
other’s words (2: 5-7), but restarts by reporting
the “opposition” type story from an earlier
point (2: 7-12).
This inserted oppositional story is hearable as
background information essential for the
recipients’ appreciation of the punchline. The
punchline, that is, the opponent’s words that
she started reporting in 2: 5-7, but were left
unreported, are repeated and completed in 2:
16-18. In this story the teller presents the
oppositional conversation in a BCBC format
where B is the teller and C the opponent, that
is, Lina. The opponent is reported as making
the questions and the teller as responding to
them. The reported questions are presented as
aggressive and challenging of the responses
given by the teller (2: 9-10, “are you serious?
he gets such a salary and he’ll quit?”). With the
reported assessment of 2: 19-22, Lina is
presented as expressing her overt disapproval
of Panos’s claims which are also adapted by
Christiana. This is achieved with her reported
exaggerated claim that even if she was asked to
do copying she would do it for the money. This
becomes even more extreme because it is
accompanied with an “extreme case
formulation” (“all day”). This is a strong
criticism of the teller and her friend’s beliefs.
Christiana is complaining about her making
such a strong criticism of their beliefs. The
mimicked exaggeration in reproducing the
opponent’s words effected with stretch and
emphasis clearly detaches the teller from their
inside meaning.
The reported claim is responded to with a
rhetorical question by one of the recipients (2:
24-25). This question is hearable as a slot in
the oppositional conversation reported by the
teller because it comes off as a piece of the
complainant’s argument. With that she
challenges the opponent’s claim by bringing it
into question. The repetition of the extreme
case formulation “all day” is employed to
challenge the extreme claim of the opponent.
This question is framed as an ironic challenge
based on the impossibility of what is being
asked “well &gt;what did she get a master’s for,
to make copies all day?&lt;” reinforced with the
“extreme case” “all day?”. This question
serves as an ironic challenge on another level
too, that of the shared knowledge that Lina is
very proud of having a master’s degree so her
claim is not true. Hence, with this question the
recipient claims disbelief of the opponent’s
assessment. In addition, this question serves as
an “impossible description” (Torode, 1996).

As was mentioned above in complaints it is
important for the teller to establish his/her
recipients’ affiliation. In my data, where the
teller is complaining about another, this is
usually achieved with extreme and hyperbolic
descriptions of the other’s misbehaviour.
Thus, in 3: 1-3 the teller introduces a
complaint about a non-present party’s
misbehaviour by soliciting a “reminiscence
recognition” from E, the knowing recipient
(cf. Lerner, 1992: 255) about the principal
character’s (cf. Goodwin, 1984) behaviour. By
characterizing Andie’s behaviour as a
“syndrome”, the teller (3: 3) foreshows a
negative telling/criticism of Andie and
establishes her stance towards the upcoming
telling. In addition, through the reminiscence
recognition solicit she invites the knowing
recipient to confirm what it assesses and
express a similar stance. Since the addressed
recipient withholds a response, the teller
through an extreme description (3: 5-6)
identified as such by the ECF “every time”
employs a second solicit of reminiscence
recognition (3: 5) addressed to E, the knowing
recipient. E (3: 6) responds negatively to the
solicit and this is in disagreement with the
expectations of the solicit. The teller initiates a
third solicit of reminiscence recognition (3: 8-
10) and finally receives recognition by the
knowing recipient (3: 14-15). The ECF “every
time” is repeated by the teller (3:18-20) in a
last attempt to receive recognition. The
addressed recipient with a “candidate
understanding” (Wilkinson and Kitzinger,
2006) in the form of a question (3: 21) reveals
recognition of the connection between the
information given in the preface and the topic
of the upcoming telling, that is, what the story
is about and asks about it directly, “so? (.) did
she do that last ni::ght too?”.
The telling (3: 22-23) is designed as a surprise
source as shown by the fact that it responds to
a yes/no question (3: 21) with a detailed
description of the third person’s misconduct
and the placement of the address form
“guy::s” in turn final position. The telling is
responded to by the recipient (3: 24) with an
assertion of “ritualized disbelief” (Heritage,
1984: 339) which treats the prior utterance as
news (Wilkinson and Kitzinger, 2006). The
teller in each of her turns (22-23, 27, 29-31,
33, 35, 37) adds another increment which
forms part of the exaggerated description of
the transgression of the principal character’s
behaviour. The description of the other’s
transgression has its climax in 3: 37.
The recipients, that is, M (3: 38), A (3: 39) and
P (3: 40-41) make an evaluation upon the
story-completion one after the other. Thus M
(3: 38) and A (3: 39) both display “assertions
of ritualized disbelief”. 4 P (3: 40-41), produces
a rhetorical question, identified as such
because it does not expect a response since it
brings into question a common knowledge. It
is framed as ironic evaluation, based on the
fact that is not sequentially linked to the
previous talk. In addition, the extreme ECF
“all her time” adds to the ironic hearing. The
ironic evaluation conveyed is also recognized
based on the shared knowledge that Andie is
visiting a priest often and consults with him.
Hence, with this assertion P (3: 40-41) offers
another argument for Andie’s behaviour being
reprehensible by ironically evaluating her
incompatible actions. Her behaviour as
described by the teller contradicts the fact that
she is known to spend a great deal of time with
the priest.

interactional and sequential work
accomplished with ECFs in complaining
through a description of a non-present party’s
misbehavior and in reporting opposition-type
stories. Specifically, the focus was on
complaints about the behaviour of a third non-
present party which develops with the
reporting of two-party “opposition type”
exchanges in which the teller is one of the two
parties involved (Schegloff, 1984). The
contrasting positions are presented with the
BCBC formula with the opponent’s position
occupying the last turn.
In exploring the sequential positioning of
ECFs, I discovered that a regular place of their
4 These items “treat a prior utterance as news for
recipient” (Heritage, 1984: 339), but according to
Wilkinson and Kitzinger these kinds of assertions “do
more than this: they convey the speaker’s amazed
incredulity and may also thus constitute a kind of
surprise response in their own right” (2006: 34).

occurrence in storytelling sequences is on the
punchline of the story and more specifically on
the culmination of the reporting of “opposition
type” conversation.
The occurrence of ECFs at the end of the
telling sequence seems to be associated with
issues of affiliation that are sought from the
recipients since the “the story recipient’s slot
after story completion” is a marked place for
the occurrence of evaluations where the
recipient is expected to side either with the
teller or her opponent. (Schegloff, 1984: 44).
Thus at this place the teller offers to the
recipient something extreme to evaluate and
challenge.
In the extracts above recipients respond with
evaluations expressed with rhetorical questions
which consist of repetitions of “extreme case
formulation(s)” (Pomerantz, 1986) and
“impossible description(s)” (Torode, 1996) of
a third person’s overbuilt claim or words.
To sum up extracts (1 &amp; 2) examined in this
paper revealed the following pattern:

Extract 3 revealed the following pattern
Teller: Description of the other’s
misbehavior with ECFs.
Recipient: Evaluation with ECF
To conclude with this study proves that the
occurrence of ECF at the puncline is used to
elicit the affiliation of the recipients, who
express agreement/affiliation with the teller by
challenging the ECF proffered by her
opponent. This proves Sacks’s (1972: 341)
observation that in some sequences certain
activities have regular places of occurrence to
such an extent that their absence is noticeable.
This observation leads “to a distinction
between a “slot” and the “items” which fill it
and to proposing that certain activities are
accomplished by a combination between some
item and some slot” (id.).

Opposition-type stories report the oppositional conversation of the teller with a third non-present party (id.). Interestingly, in the conversational extracts examined in this study, the conversation reported is culminated with the opponent’s reported extreme claim (ECF) occupying the last turn.

The Greek speech community in Cyprus is defined as diglossic. Diglossia in Cyprus refers to the simultaneous use of the dialect (Cypriot Greek dialect, CD) and the demotic Greek (Modern Greek, MG). This article reports some of the findings of a study of extreme case formulations (ECFs) (Edwards, 2000; Pomerantz, 1986) in spontaneous conversations exclusively conducted in Cypriot Greek. In a seminal article, Pomerantz (1986) drew attention to the conversational uses of extreme case formulations (ECFs). Edwards (2000: 347- 8) explains that ECFs are “descriptions or assessments that deploy extreme expressions such as every, all, none, best, least, as good as it gets, always, perfectly, brand new, and absolutely”. Pomerantz (1986: 219-220) summarizes the three main uses of ECFs, mainly used in complaints, in the following way: (1) to assert the strongest case in anticipation of non-sympatheti</context>

The Greek speech community in Cyprus is defined as diglossic. Diglossia in Cyprus refers to the simultaneous use of the dialect (Cypriot Greek dialect, CD) and the demotic Greek (Modern Greek, MG). This article reports some of the findings of a study of extreme case formulations (ECFs) (Edwards, 2000; Pomerantz, 1986) in spontaneous conversations exclusively conducted in Cypriot Greek. In a seminal article, Pomerantz (1986) drew attention to the conversational uses of extreme case formulations (ECFs). Edwards (2000: 347- 8) explains that ECFs are “descriptions or assessments that deploy extreme expressions such as every, all, none, best, least, as good as it gets, always, perfectly, brand new, and absolutely”. Pomerantz (1986: 219-220) summarizes the three main uses of ECFs, mainly used in complaints, in the following way: (1) to assert the strongest case in anticipation of non-sympathetic hearings, (2) to</context>

The oppositional exchange culminates in a piece of formulaic-sounding wisdom proffered by the mother (1: 32-33: “only when you become a mother will you understand”) which is hearable as an “extra-ordinary” claim (Pomerantz, 1986) framed as such based on the use of the ECF “only” followed with the idiomatic expression “when you become a mother will you understand”. According to 3 Mamas is a Cypriot journalist. Torode, “an extreme case is designed to close an argument. As such it is vulnerable to attempts at refutation” (1996: 10). Thus, the placement of that extraordinary claim at the climax of the story should be seen in relation to motivations of eliciting affiliation. In other words the teller offers to the recipient an extreme claim in order to elicit a refutation of that claim. The reporting of the opponent’s word</context>

(Schegloff, 1984: 44). Thus at this place the teller offers to the recipient something extreme to evaluate and challenge. In the extracts above recipients respond with evaluations expressed with rhetorical questions which consist of repetitions of “extreme case formulation(s)” (Pomerantz, 1986) and “impossible description(s)” (Torode, 1996) of a third person’s overbuilt claim or words.

As Edwards explains (id.) denying or insisting on something in an extreme way can highlight the action of denying or insisting, as a kind of stance or attitude (cf.

This question is framed as an ironic challenge based on the impossibility of what is being asked “well &gt;what did she get a master’s for, to make copies all day?&lt;” reinforced with the “extreme case” “all day?”. This question serves as an ironic challenge on another level too, that of the shared knowledge that Lina is very proud of having a master’s degree so her claim is not true. Hence, with this question the recipient claims disbelief of the opponent’s assessment. In addition, this question serves as an “impossible description” (Torode, 1996). 5 As was mentioned above ECFs do not only occur in reporting and responding to opposition-type stories, but also in complaining about a non-present party’s misbehavior in general. Extract 3 that follows is a representative example of that case. (3) (C = Christiana; M = Maria; A = Angelina; P = Petra; E = Eleana.
