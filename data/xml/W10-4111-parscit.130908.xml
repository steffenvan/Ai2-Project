The study on Automatic Recognizing
usages of Modern Chinese Adverbs
is one of the important parts of the
NLP-oriented research of Chinese
Functional words Knowledge Base.
To solve the problems of the existing
rule-based method of adverbs’ usages
recognition based on the previous
work, this paper has studied auto-
matically recognizing common Chi-
nese adverbs’ usages using statistical
methods. Three statistical models, viz.
CRF, ME, and SVM, are used to la-
bel several common Chinese ad-
verbs’ usages on the segmentation
and part-of-speech tagged corpus of
People’s Daily(Jan 1998). The ex-
periment results show that statistical-
based method is effective in auto-
matically recognizing of several
common adverbs’ usages and has
good application prospects.

Chinese vocabulary can be divided into func-
tional words and notional words. In the field
of Natural Language Processing(NLP), many
studies on text computing or word meaning
understanding are focused on the notional
words, rarely involving functional words.
Especially in some common NLP application
fields, such as text summarization, text clas-
sification, information retrieval, and so on,
the researchers mainly take notional words as
features, and list some functional word as
stop words without considering their influ-
ence on text meaning. This will impact the
deep analysis of text semantic, especailly for
chinese, and become the bottleneck of ma-
chine understanding on text content, and im-
pede further improving the performance of
application systems. Due to Chinese lacking
morphological changes(Li X., 2005), Chi-
nese functional words undertake the gram-
matical functions and grammatical meanings,
and in other language these functions are
mainly undertaken by morphological
changes. So, functional words play an more
important role in Chinese semantic under-
standing and grammatical analysis. The
study on functional words of modern Chi-
nese semantic in Chinese text processing and
understanding has great significance.
Yu(Yu S., 2004), Liu(Liu, Y., 2004), et al,
have defined the generalized functional
words as adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions,
modal particles, auxiliary, and localizer
words. From the statistic, the number of
modern Chinese adverbs is about 1000 with
the broad definition standard. Compared with
other fuctional words, the adverbs number is
much larger. The function and usages of
modern Chinese adverbs vary widely from
each other, especially some common adverbs.
Therefore for modern Chinese text under-
standing, adverbs are the important text fea-
tures which can not be neglected. For the
modern Chinese adverbs, only using the
segmentation and part-of-speech tagging in-
formation for Chinese text automatic proc-
essing and understanding is not enough. So,
particular study on the usage of adverbs in
texts comprehensive is indispensable, and the
automatic identification of adverbs’ usage in
some extend is of great significance.
