<bodyText confidence="0.999884625">
This demonstration presents an intelligent infor-
mation platform MODEST. MODEST will pro-
vide enterprises with the services of retrieving
news from websites, extracting commercial in-
formation, exploring customers’ opinions, and
analyzing collaborative/competitive social net-
works. In this way, enterprises can improve the
competitive abilities and facilitate potential col-
laboration activities. At the meanwhile, MOD-
EST can also help governments to acquire in-
formation about one single company or the entire
board timely, and make prompt strategies for
better support. Currently, MODEST is applied to
the pillar industries of Hong Kong, including
innovative finance, modem logistics, information
technology, etc.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998">
With the rapid development of Web 2.0, the
amount of information is exploding. There are
millions of events towards companies and bil-
lions of opinions on products generated every
day (Liu, 2012). Such enormous information
cannot only facilitate companies to improve their
competitive abilities, but also help government to
make prompt decisions for better support or
timely monitor, e.g. effective risk management.
For this reason, there is a growing demand of
Web information mining and intelligent decision
support services for the industries. Such services
are collectively referred as modern service,
which includes the following requirements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.929847666666667">
(1) To efficiently retrieve relevant information
from the websites;
(2) To accurately determine the latest business
news and trends of the company;
(3) To identify and analyze customers’ opinions
towards the company;
(4) To explore the collaborative and competitive
relationship with other companies;
(5) To leverage the knowledge mined from the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.945843363636364">
business news and company social network
for decision support.
In this demonstration, we will present a Web
information mining and decision support plat-
form, MODEST1. The objective of MODEST is
to provide modern services for both enterprises
and government, including collecting Web in-
formation, making deep analysis, and providing
supporting decision. The innovation of MOD-
EST is focusing on deep analysis which incor-
porates the following functions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.795668814814815">
• Topic detection and tracking function is to
cluster the hot events and capture the rela-
tionship between the relevant events based on
the collected data from websites (event also
referred as topic in this paper). In order to re-
alize this function, Web mining techniques
are adopted, e.g. topic clustering, heuristics
algorithms, etc.
• The second function is to identify and analyze
customers’ opinions about the company.
Opinion mining technology (Zhou et al., 2010)
is adopted to determine the polarity of those
news, which can help the company timely and
appropriately adjust the policy to strengthen
the dominant position or avoid risks.

• The third function is to explore and analyze
social network based on the company centric.
We utilize social network analysis (SNA)
technology (Xia et al., 2010) to discover the
relationships, and we further analyze the con-
tent in fine-grained granularity to identify its
potential partners or competitors.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944">
With the help of MODEST, the companies can
acquire modern service-related information, and
timely adjust corporate policies and marketing
plan ahead. Hence, the ability of information ac-
quisition and the competitiveness of the enter-
prises can be improved accordingly.
In this paper, we will use a practical example
to illustrate our platform and evaluate the per-
formance of main functions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 will introduce the system description
as well as the main functions implementation.
The practical case study will be illustrated in
Section 3. The performance of MODEST will be
evaluated in Section 4.Finally, this paper will be
concluded in Section 5.

2 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943666666667">
In this section, we first outline the system archi-
tecture of MODEST, and then describe the im-
plementation of the main functionality in detail.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991314">
2.1 Architecture and Workflow
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973071769230769">
The MODEST system consists of three modules:
data acquisition, data analysis, and result display.
The system architecture is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: System architecture. (The module in
blue is data acquisition, the module in orange is
data analysis, and the module in light green is
result display)
(1) The core technique in the data acquisition
module is the crawler, which is developed to
collect raw data from websites, e.g. news portals,
blogosphere. Then the system parse the raw web
pages and extract information to store in the local
database for further processing.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.648722076923077">
(2) The data analysis module can be divided into
two parts:
• NLP pre-processor: utilizes NLP (natural
language processing) techniques and some
toolkits to perform the pre-processing on the
raw data in (1), including word segmenta-
tion, part-of-speech (POS) tagging1, stop-
word removal, and named entity recognition
(NER)2. We then create knowledgebase for
individual industry, such as domain-specific
sentiment word lexicon, name entity collec-
tion, and so on.
• Miner:makes use of data mining techniques
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9232161">
to realize four functions, topic detection and
tracking (TDT), multi-document summari-
zation 3 (MDS), social network analysis
(SNA), and opinion mining (OM). The re-
sults of data analysis are also stored in the
database.
(3) The result display module read out the analy-
sis results from the database and display them to
users in the form of plain text, charts, figures, as
well as video.

2.2 Function Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999002">
Since the innovation of MODEST is focusing on
the module of data analysis, we will describe its
main functions in detail, including topic detec-
tion and tracking, opinion mining, and social
networks analysis.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.836847">
2.2.1 Topic Detection and Tracking
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999540625">
The TDT function targets on detecting and
tracking the hot topics for each individual com-
pany. Given a period of data collected from web-
sites, there are various discussions about the
company. In order to extract these topics, clus-
tering methods (Viermetz et al., 2007 and Yoon
et al., 2009) are implemented to explore the top-
ics. Note that during the period of data collection,
different topics with respect to the same compa-
ny may have relations. We, therefore, utilize hi-
erarchical clustering methods4to capture the po-
tential relations.
Due to the large amount of data, it is impossi-
ble to view all the topics at a snapshot. MODEST
utilizes topic tracking technique (Wang et al.,
2008) to identify related stories with a stream of

media. It is convenient for the users to see the
latest information about the company.
In summary, TDT function provides the ser-
vices of detecting and tracking the latest and
emergent topics, analyzing the relationships of
topics on the dynamics of the company. It meets
the aforementioned demand, “to accurately grasp
the latest business news and trends of the com-
pany”.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.987372">
2.2.2 Opinion Mining
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989455076923077">
The objective of OM function is to discover
opinions towards a company and classify the
opinions into positive, negative, or neutral.
The opinion mining function is redesigned
based on our own opinion mining engine (Zhou
et al., 2010). It separates opinion identification
and polarity classification into two stages.
Given a set of documents that are relevant to
the company, we first split the documents into
sentences, and then identify whether the sentence
is opinionated or not. We extract the features
shown in Table 1 for opinion identification.
(Zhou et al., 2010)
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.9631435">
Table 1: Features adopted in the opinionated
sentence classifier
</tableCaption>
<table confidence="0.958046421052632">
Punctuation level features

The presence of other punctuations: &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;!&amp;quot;
Word-Level and entity-level features
The presence of known opinion operators

Bi-gram features

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908714285714">
These features are then combined using a ra-
dial basis function (RBF) kernel and a support
vector machine (SVM) classifier (Drucker et al.,
1997) is trained based on the NTCIR 8training
data for opinion identification (Kando, 2010).
For those opinionated sentences, we then clas-
sify them into positive, negative, or neutral. In
addition to the features shown in Table 1, we
incorporate features of s-VSM (Sentiment Vector
Space Model) (Xia et al., 2008) to enhance the
performance. The principles of the s-VSM are
listed as follows: (1) Only sentiment-related
words are used to produce sentiment features for
the s-VSM. (2) The sentiment words are appro-
priately disambiguated with the neighboring ne-
gations and modifiers. (3) Negations and modifi-
ers are included in the s-VSM to reflect the func-
tions of inversing, strengthening and weakening.
Sentiment unit is the appropriate element com-
plying with the above principles. (Zhou et al.,
2010)
In addition to polarity classification, opinion
holder and target are also recognized in OM
function for further identifying the relationship
that two companies have, e.g. collaborative or
competitive. Both of the dependency parser and
the semantic role labeling1 (SRL) tool are in-
corporated to identify the semantic roles of each
chunk based on verbs in the sentence.
The OM function provides the company with
services of analyzing the social sentimental
feedback on the dynamics of the company. It
meets the aforementioned demand, “to identify
and analyze customers’ opinions towards the
company”.

2.2.3 Social Network Analysis
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825933333333">
SNA function aims at producing the commercial
network of companies that are hidden within the
articles.
To achieve this goal, we maintain two lexicons,
the commercial named entity lexicon and com-
mercial relation lexicon. Commercial named en-
tity are firstly located within the text and then
recorded in the commercial entity lexicon in the
pre-processor NER. Commercial relation lexicon
record the articles/documents that involve the
commercial relations. Note that the commercial
relation lexicon (Table 2) is manually compiled.
In this work, we consider only two general
commercial relations, namely cooperation and
competition.

3 Practical Example
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961">
In this section, we use a case study to illustrate
our system and further evaluate the performance
of the main functions with respect to those com-
panies. Due to the limited space, we just illus-
trate the main functions of topic detection, opin-
ion mining and social network analysis.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992944">
3.1 Topic Detection and Opinion Mining
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932814814815">
Figure 2(a) showed the results of topic detection
and opinion mining functions for a Hong Kong
local financial company Sun Hung Kai Proper-
ties ( &gt;AMftt�&amp;). On top of the figure are the
results of topic detection and tracking function.
Multi-document summary of the latest news is
provided for the company and more news with
the similar topics can be found by pressing the
button “��” (more). Since there are a lot of
duplicates of a piece of news on the websites, the
summary is a direct way to acquire the recent
news, which can improve the effectiveness of the
company.
The results of opinion mining function are
shown at the bottom of Figure 2(a), where the
green line indicates negative while the red line
indicates positive. In order to give a dynamic
insight of public opinions, we provide the
amount changes of positive and negative articles
with time variant. This is very helpful for the
company to capture the feedback of their mar-
keting policies. As shown in Figure 2(a), there
were 14 negative articles (ffi,_gjf g ) on Oct. 29,
2012, which achieved negative peak within the 6
months. The users would probably read those 14
articles and adjust the company strategy accord-
ingly.

3.2 Social Network Analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.9998085625">
Figure 2(b) shows the social network based on
the centric company in yellow, Sun Hung Kai
Properties ( &gt;AMftt�&amp;). We only list the half
of the connected companies with collaborative
relationship from Sun Hung Kai Properties, and
remove the competitive ones due to limited space.
The thickness of the line indicates the strength of
the collaboration between the two companies.
The social network can explore the potential
partners/competitors of a company. Furthermore,
users are allowed to adjust the depth and set the
nodes count of the network. The above analysis
can provide a richer insight in to a company.
In the following section, we will make exper-
iments to investigate the performance of the
above functions.

4 Experiment and Result
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999386428571429">
In our evaluation, the experiments were made
based on 17692 articles collected from 52 Hong
Kong websites during 6 months (1/7/2012~
31/12/2012). We investigate the performance of
MODEST based on the standard metrics pro-
posed by NIST1, including precision, recall, and
F-score.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.596484666666667">
Precision (P) is the fraction of detected articles
(U) that are relevantto the topic (I).
Recall (R) is the fraction of the articles (T) that
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.975961">
are relevant to the topic that are successfully de-
tected (I).
Usually, there is an inverse relationship be-
tween precision and recall, where it is possible to
increase one at the cost of reducing the other.
Therefore, precision and recall scores are not
discussed in isolation. Instead, F-Score (F) is
proposed to combine precision and recall, which
is the harmonic meanof precision and recall.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994659">
4.1 Topic Detection and Tracking

<bodyText confidence="0.999933">
We first assess the performance of the topic de-

the amount of articles vary a lot. Therefore, we
calculate the metrics for each individual dataset,
and then compute the weighted mean value. The
experimental results are shown in Table 3.

From the experimental results, we can find
that the average F-Score is about 85.69%.The
dataset in the second row achieves the best per-
formance while the dataset in the third only get
76.56% in F-Score. It is because that the amount
of articles is smaller than the others and the re-
call value is very low. As far as we know, the
best run of topic detection in (Allan et al., 2007)
achieved 84%. The performance of topic detec-
tion in MODEST is comparable.

best run in NTCIR. However, the engine is
trained on NTCIR corpus, which consists of arti-
cles of general domain, while the test set focuses
on the financial domain. We further train our
engine on the data from the financial domain and
the average F-Score improves to over 80%.

There are millions of events towards companies and billions of opinions on products generated every day (Liu, 2012). Such enormous information cannot only facilitate companies to improve their competitive abilities, but also help government to make prompt decisions for better support or timely monitor, e.g. effective risk management. For this reason, there is a growing demand of Web information mining and intelligent decision support services for the industries. Such services are collectively referred as modern service, which includes the following requirements: (1) To efficiently retrieve relevant information from the websites; (2) To accurately determine the latest business news and trends of the company</context>

The innovation of MODEST is focusing on deep analysis which incorporates the following functions: • Topic detection and tracking function is to cluster the hot events and capture the relationship between the relevant events based on the collected data from websites (event also referred as topic in this paper). In order to realize this function, Web mining techniques are adopted, e.g. topic clustering, heuristics algorithms, etc. • The second function is to identify and analyze customers’ opinions about the company. Opinion mining technology (Zhou et al., 2010) is adopted to determine the polarity of those news, which can help the company timely and appropriately adjust the policy to strengthen the dominant position or avoid risks. 1 This work is supported by the Innovation and Technology Fund of Hong Kong SAR. 97 Proceedings of 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, pages 97–102, Baltimore, Maryland USA, June 23-24, 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics • The third function is to explore and analyze social network based on the company centric.

In summary, TDT function provides the services of detecting and tracking the latest and emergent topics, analyzing the relationships of topics on the dynamics of the company. It meets the aforementioned demand, “to accurately grasp the latest business news and trends of the company”. 2.2.2 Opinion Mining The objective of OM function is to discover opinions towards a company and classify the opinions into positive, negative, or neutral. The opinion mining function is redesigned based on our own opinion mining engine (Zhou et al., 2010). It separates opinion identification and polarity classification into two stages. Given a set of documents that are relevant to the company, we first split the documents into sentences, and then identify whether the sentence is opinionated or not. We extract the features shown in Table 1 for opinion identification. (Zhou et al., 2010) Table 1: Features adopted in the opinionated sentence classifier Punctuation level features The presence of direct quote punctuation &amp;quot;“&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;”&amp;quot; The presence of other punctuations: &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;!&amp;quot; Word-Level and entity-level features The presence of known opinion op</context>

The principles of the s-VSM are listed as follows: (1) Only sentiment-related words are used to produce sentiment features for the s-VSM. (2) The sentiment words are appropriately disambiguated with the neighboring negations and modifiers. (3) Negations and modifiers are included in the s-VSM to reflect the functions of inversing, strengthening and weakening. Sentiment unit is the appropriate element complying with the above principles. (Zhou et al., 2010) In addition to polarity classification, opinion holder and target are also recognized in OM function for further identifying the relationship that two companies have, e.g. collaborative or competitive. Both of the dependency parser and the semantic role labeling1 (SRL) tool are incorporated to identify the semantic roles of each chunk based on verbs in the sentence. The OM function provides the company with services of analyzing the social sentimental feedback on the dynamics of the company. It meets the aforementioned demand, “to identify and analyze customers’ opinions towards the company”.</context>

However, the engine is trained on NTCIR corpus, which consists of articles of general domain, while the test set focuses on the financial domain. We further train our engine on the data from the financial domain and the average F-Score improves to over 80%. 5 Conclusions This demonstration presents an intelligent information platform designed to mine Web information and provide decisions for modern service, MODEST.
