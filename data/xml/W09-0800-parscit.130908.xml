We are delighted to present you with this volume containing the papers accepted for presentation at the
EACL 2009 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages, held in Athens, Greece, on
March 31st, 2009.
The Workshop is an opportunity for the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Approaches to
Semitic Languages to meet and discuss current and future directions in Computational Linguistic and
Natural Language Processing approaches to Semitic Languages. Previous workshops took place in 1998
(Montreal), 2002 (Philadelphia), 2005 (Ann Arbor) and 2007 (Prague). We are happy to see more, better
submissions every year. This year we received 19 submissions, of which 9 were selected for presentation
and are included in this volume. These papers address Arabic (both standard and dialectal), Hebrew and
Ancient Syriac, as well as general issues pertaining to all Semitic languages. We are privileged to have
Prof. Michael Gasser (Indiana University) as our keynote speaker this year. Professor Gasser will talk on
Finite state morphology for Ethiopian Semitic languages.
We are extremely grateful to the members of the Program Committee who reviewed the submissions
and helped shape up the Program: Ann Bies (LDC, University of Pennsylvania, USA), Tim Buckwalter
(University of Maryland, USA), Violetta Cavalli-Sforza (Carnegie Mellon University, USA), Joseph
Dichy (University of Lyon 2, France), Michael Elhadad (Ben Gurion University, Israel), Martha W.
Evens (Illinois Institute of Technology, USA), Ray Fabri (University of Malta), Ali Farghaly (Oracle,
USA), Alexander Fraser (University of Stuttgart, Germany), Andrew Freeman (Washington University,
USA), Albert Gatt (University of Aberdeen, UK), Gregory Grefenstette, (Exalead, France), Nizar
Habash (Columbia University, USA), Alon Itai (Technion, Israel), Steven Krauwer (Utrecht University,
Netherlands), Mohamed Maamouri (LDC, University of Pennsylvania USA), Bente Maegaard (CST,
University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Nurit Melnik (Oranim College, Israel), Uzzi Ornan (Technion,
Israel), Owen Rambow (Columbia University, USA), Paolo Rosso (Universidad Politecnica Valencia,
Spain), Khalil Sima’an (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands), Abdelhadi Soudi (Ecole Nationale de
l’Industrie Minerale, Morocco), Adam Ussishkin (University of Arizona, USA), and Imed Zitouni (IBM
Research, USA)
Above all, we would like to thank the authors and the participants of the Workshop. We hope you have
a very enjoyable and productive time in Athens!
