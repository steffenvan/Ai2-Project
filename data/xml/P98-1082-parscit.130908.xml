<bodyText confidence="0.99986352631579">
This paper reports the results of a preliminary
experiment on the detection of semantic vari-
ants of terms in a French technical document.
The general goal of our work is to help the struc-
turation of terminologies. Two kinds of seman-
tic variants can be found in traditional termi-
nologies : strict synonymy links and fuzzier re-
lations like see-also. We have designed three
rules which exploit general dictionary informa-
tion to infer synonymy relations between com-
plex candidate terms. The results have been
examined by a human terminologist. The ex-
pert has judged that half of the overall pairs of
terms are relevant for the semantic variation.
He validated an important part of the detected
links as synonymy. Moreover, it appeared that
numerous errors are due to few mis-interpreted
links: they could be eliminated by few exception
rules.

The work presented here is a part of an indus-
trial project of Technical Document Consulta-
tion System (Gros et al., 1996) at the French
electricity company EDF. The goal is to develop
tools to help a terminologist in the construction
of a structured terminology (cf. figure 1) pro-
viding :

cepts in a technical document, (Bourigault,
1992);
• semantic links such as the see-also relation.

<bodyText confidence="0.9968832">
This can be viewed as a two-step process. The
candidate terms (i.e. lexical units which can
be terms if a domain expert validates them) are
first automatically extracted from the technical
document with a Terminology Extraction Soft-
ware (LEXTER) (Bourigault, 1992). The list
of candidate terms is then structured into a se-
mantic network. We focus on the latter point
by detecting semantic variants, especially syn-
onyms.

In order to build a structured terminology,
we thus attempt to link candidate terms ex-

For instance, from synonyms such as materiel
(equipment) / equipement (fittings), rnarche

link between candidate terms materiel elec-

1.2 Using a general language dictionary
for specialized corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992400825">
As domain specific semantic information is sel-
dom available, our aim is to evaluate the rel-
evance and usefulness of general semantic re-
sources for the detection of synonymy between
candidate terms.
For this study, we used a French general
dictionary Le Robert supplied by the Institut
National de la Langue Francaise (INaLF). It
provides synonyms and analogical words dis-
tributed among the different senses (cf. figure 2)
of each word entry. It is exploited as a machine-
readable synonym dictionary.
We use a 200 000 word corpus about electric
power plant. Its size is typical of the technical
documents. It is very technical if one consid-
ers the dictionary lemma coverage for this cor-
pus (45%). Concerning two other available doc-
uments dealing with software engineering and
electric network planning, the dictionary lemma
coverage is respectively of 65% and 57%. In that
respect the chosen corpus is the worse case for
this experiment.
The present corpus has been analyzed by
the Terminology Extraction Software LEX-
TER which extracted 12 043 candidate terms
(2 831 nouns, 597 adjectives and 8 615 noun
phrases). Each complex candidate term (ligne
d&apos;alimentation, supply line) is analyzed into a
head (ligne, line) and an expansion (alimenta-
tion, supply). It is part of a syntactic network
(cf. figure 3).
2 Method for the detection of
synonymous terms
The terminological variation include morpho-
logical (fiectional, derivational) variants, syn-
tactic variant (coordinated and compound
terms) but also semantic variant (synonyms, hy-
peronyms) of controlled terms. In this experi-
ment, we attempt to infer synonymy links be-
tween candidate terms.

2.1 Semantic variation and synonymy
relation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986503125">
Semantic variation The semantic variation
includes relations (e.g. synonymy and see-also)
between words of the same grammatical cate-
gory, even if one may also take into consider-
ation phenomena such as elliptic relations or
combination of synonymy and derivation rela-
tions (e.g. heat and thermal) where the cate-
gories may be different.
Fuzzier relations such as the traditional see-
also relations of terminologies are also very use-
ful. Once a link is established between two
terms, it is sometimes easy to interpret for the
terminology users. Moreover, for applications
such as document retrieval, the link itself is of-
ten more important than its very type.
Synonymy We use a synonymy definition
close to that of WordNet (Miller et al., 1993).
It is defined as an equivalence relation between
terms having the same meaning in a particu-
lar context. The transitivity rule cannot be ap-
plied to the links extracted from the dictionary.
Indeed, while the synonymy is sometimes very
contextual in the dictionary, the links appear in
the data without context information and would
produce a great deal of errors. Thus, for in-
stance, the synonymy links between the adjec-
tives polaire (polar) and glacial (icy) and the ad-
jectives glacial (cold) and insensible (insensitive)
would allow to deduce a wrong synonym link
between polaire and insensible.
Moreover, tests carried out on dictionary
samples show that the relevant links which

because its both ends, materiel and equipement
exist in the studied corpus. For this document,
3 369 synonymy links between 1 542 simple
terms are preserved.

Assuming that the semantics and the synonymy
of the complex candidate terms are composi-
tional, we design three rules to detect synonymy
relations between candidate terms. Consider-
ing two candidates terms, if one of the following
conditions is met, a synonymy link is added to
the terminological network:

cess by including the newly detected links in
our base until no new link can be found. In the
present experiment, the process ends up after
three iterations.

dated 37% of them (i.e. 146 links, cf. table 2)
as real synonymy links: hauteur d&apos;eau (water

<bodyText confidence="0.999230000000001">
Most of the synonymy links between candi-
date terms are detected at the first iteration
(383 liens out of 396). The majority of the val-
idated links are given by the two first rules: 89
validated links out of 206 with the first rule (ad-
mission d&apos;air (air intake) / entrée d&apos;air (air en-
try)), 49 out of 105 with the second (toit flottant
(floating roof) / toit mobile (movable roof) and
collecteur general (general collector) / collecteur
commun (common collector)). Obviously, the
last rule has a lower precision rate: 8 out of
85 (fausse manceuvre (wrong operation) / mau-
vaise manipulation (bad handling)). However,
it infers important links which are difficult to
detect by hand.
Other useful links On the whole, the expert
judged that half of the detected links are useful
for the terminology structuration even if he re-
jected some of them as real synonymy links (cf.
figure 5). Our method detects different types of
links: meronymy, antonymy, relations between
close concepts, connected parts of a whole mech-
anism, etc.
The meronymy links are the most numerous
after synonymy (rapport de siirete (safety report)
I analyse de sitrete (safety analysis)). In the
previous example, whereas rapport (report) and
analyse (analysis) are given as synonyms by the
general language dictionary (which is context-
free), their technical meanings in our document
are more specific. Therefore, rapport de siirete
is a meronym rather than a synonym of analyse
de siirete in the studied document.
Other detected links allow to group the can-
didate terms which refer to related concepts.
For instance, we detected a link between the
device ligne de vidange (draining line) and the
place point de purge (blow-down point) which is
relevant since a draining line ends at a blow-
down point. Likewise, it is useful to link fin de
vidange (draining end) which designates an op-
eration and destination des purges (blow-down
destination) which is the corresponding equip-
ment.
The expert considered that the link be-
tween the candidate terms (commande me-
canique (mechanical control) / ordre automa-
tique (automatic order)) expresses an antonymy
relation, although it is infered from the syn-
onymy relation of the dictionary mecanique
(mechanical) / automatique (automatic). It ap-
pears that those adjectives have a particular
meaning in the present corpus. Therefore, ev-
ery link detected from this &amp;quot;synonymy&amp;quot; link is
an antonymy one.
Those links express various relations some-
times difficult to name, even by the expert.
Such links are important in a terminology.

Most real errors are due to the lack of con-

noisy data existing in the dictionary. For in-

time or weather. According to the dictio-
nary,temps (weather) is a synonym of temper-
ature (temperature)2, but this meaning is ex-
cluded from the present corpus. Since we can-
not distinguish the different meanings, the syn-
onymy of temps / time and temperature is taken

ture) are thus given as synonymous. This type
of wrong links is rather important in the list
presented to the expert: between 10 to 20 links
out of 396.
On the contrary, about ten wrong links are
due to the elision of common terms in the do-
main. For instance, the term activite (activity)
which actually corresponds to the term radioac-
tivite (radioactivity) in the document is given as
a synonym of energie (energy) in the dictionary.
We have detected links such as activite haute
(high activity) / haute energie (high energy).
As regards metaphor, we have observed that
it preserves semantic relation. For instance, in
graph theory, the link (arbre (tree) / feuille
(leaf)) can be inferred from the meronyny in-
formation of general dictionary.
Those types of wrong links are easily iden-
tified during the validation. Some exceptions
rules can be designed to first regroup those links

3.3 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993513513513">
The inferred links express not only synonymy,
but also other relations which may be difficult
to name. Apart from real errors, these fuzzy
see-also relations are useful in the context of a
consultation system.
The results of this first experiment are en-
couraging. Although the precision rate and the
number of links are low (37%, 396 links), the
use of complementary methods (e.g. detection
of syntactic variants) would allow to propagate
these links and increase their number. Also,
the use of other knowledge sources or different
methods (Habert et al., 1996) is necessary to
increase precision rate and find links between
more technical candidate terms.
As regards the improvement of such a
method, the terminology acquisition by an ex-
pert will take tens of hours while the automatic
extraction takes one hour and the validation of
the links has been done in two hours.
The main difficulty is to evaluate the recall in
the results because there is no standard refer-
ence in that matter, giving the overall relevant
relations in the document. One may think that
the comparison with links manually detected by
an expert is the best evaluation, but such man-
ual detection is subjective. Regarding the vali-
dation by several experts, it is well-known that
such validation would give different results de-
pending on the background of each expert (Sz-
pakowicz et al., 1996). So, we are reduced to
compare our results with those obtained by dif-
ferent methods even though they are not perfect
either. We are planning to compare the clusters
found by our method with the clustering one of
(Assadi, 1997) to study how the results overlap
and are complementary.

The variant detection in specialized corpora
must be taken into account for information re-
trieval. This complex operation involves the
semantic as well as the morphological and
syntactic level. (Jacquemin, 1996) design a
unification-based partial parser FASTER which
analyses raw technical text while meta-rules
detect morpho-syntactic variants of controlled
terms (blood cell, blood mononuclear cell). By
using morphological and part-of-speech mod-
ules, the system are extended to the verbal
phrases (tree cutting, tree have been cut down)
(Klavans et al., 1997). Dealing with syntac-
tic paraphrase in the general language, (Dras,
1997) propose a similar representation by using
the STAG formalism to detect syntactic related
sentences. Because we deal with the semantic
level, our work is complementary of those.
Semantic variation is rarely studied in spe-
cialized domains. Works on word similarity and
word sense disambiguation are generally based
on statistical methods designed for large or even
very large corpora (Hindle, 1990; Agirre and
Rigau, 1996). Therefore, they cannot be ap-
plied for technical documents which usually are
medium size corpora. However, dealing with
already linguistic filtered data, (Assadi, 1997)
aims at statistically build rough clusters sup-
posing that similar candidate terms have similar
expansions. Then he relies on human expertise
for the semantic interpretation. It differs from
our work which tries to automatically explicit
the semantic relations. In order to disambiguate
noun objects in a short text (30 000 words),
(Li et al., 1995) design heuristic rules using se-
mantic similarity information in WordNet and
verbs as context. Their system disambiguate an
encouraging number on noun-verb pairs if one
considers single and multiple sense assigned to
a word.
In (Basili et al., 1997), the lexical knowledge
base WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) is used as a
bootstrap for verb disambiguation. They tune
it to the domain of the studied document by
taking into account the contexts in which the
verbs are used. This tuning leads both to elimi-
nate certain semantic categories and to add new
ones. For instance, the category contact is cre-
ated for the verb to record. The resulted sense
classification is thus a better description of the
verb specialized meanings.
Our symbolic and dictionary-based approach
is close that of (Basin et al., 1997). They both
use general language information (traditional
dictionary vs. WordNet) for specialized cor-
pora. However, their goals differ: disambigua-
tion vs. semantic relation identification.

The use of a synonym dictionary and the rules of
synonymous candidate terms detection we have
designed allow to extract an encouraging num-
ber of links in a very technical corpus. An ex-
pert validated these links. More than one third
of the detected links are synonymy relations.
Beside synonymy, our method detects various
kinds of semantic variants. Wrong links due to
the polysemy can be easily eliminated with ex-
ception rules by comparing selectional patterns
and generalized contexts (Basili et al., 1993; Gr-
ishman and Sterling, 1994).
Our work shows that general semantic data
are useful for the terminology structuration and
the synonym detection in a corpus of specialized
language. The results show that semantic vari-
ants can be automatically detected. Of course,
the number of acquired links is relatively low
but our method is not to be used in isolation.

<abstract confidence="0.996656">This paper reports the results of a preliminary experiment on the detection of semantic variants of terms in a French technical document. The general goal of our work is to help the structuration of terminologies. Two kinds of semantic variants can be found in traditional terminologies : strict synonymy links and fuzzier relike have designed three rules which exploit general dictionary information to infer synonymy relations between complex candidate terms. The results have been examined by a human terminologist. The expert has judged that half of the overall pairs of terms are relevant for the semantic variation. He validated an important part of the detected links as synonymy. Moreover, it appeared that numerous errors are due to few mis-interpreted links: they could be eliminated by few exception rules.</abstract>

One may think that the comparison with links manually detected by an expert is the best evaluation, but such manual detection is subjective. Regarding the validation by several experts, it is well-known that such validation would give different results depending on the background of each expert (Szpakowicz et al., 1996). So, we are reduced to compare our results with those obtained by different methods even though they are not perfect either. We are planning to compare the clusters found by our method with the clustering one of (Assadi, 1997) to study how the results overlap and are complementary. 4 Related works The variant detection in specialized corpora must be taken into account for information retrieval.

This tuning leads both to eliminate certain semantic categories and to add new ones. For instance, the category contact is created for the verb to record. The resulted sense classification is thus a better description of the verb specialized meanings. Our symbolic and dictionary-based approach is close that of (Basin et al., 1997).

The goal is to develop tools to help a terminologist in the construction of a structured terminology (cf. figure 1) providing : • terms of a domain, i.e. simple or complex lexical units pointing out accurate concepts in a technical document, (Bourigault, 1992); • semantic links such as the see-also relation. This can be viewed as a two-step process. The candidate terms (i.e. lexical units which can be terms if a domain expert validates them) are first automatically extracted from the technical document with a Terminology Extraction Software (LEXTER) (Bourigault, 1992). The list of candidate terms is then structured into a semantic network.

Apart from real errors, these fuzzy see-also relations are useful in the context of a consultation system. The results of this first experiment are encouraging. Although the precision rate and the number of links are low (37%, 396 links), the use of complementary methods (e.g. detection of syntactic variants) would allow to propagate these links and increase their number. Also, the use of other knowledge sources or different methods (Habert et al., 1996) is necessary to increase precision rate and find links between more technical candidate terms. As regards the improvement of such a method, the terminology acquisition by an expert will take tens of hours while the automatic extraction takes one hour and the validation of the links has been done in two hours. The main difficulty is to evaluate the recall in the results because there is no standard reference in that matter, giving the overall relevant relations in the document.

Fuzzier relations such as the traditional seealso relations of terminologies are also very useful. Once a link is established between two terms, it is sometimes easy to interpret for the terminology users. Moreover, for applications such as document retrieval, the link itself is often more important than its very type. Synonymy We use a synonymy definition close to that of WordNet (Miller et al., 1993). It is defined as an equivalence relation between terms having the same meaning in a particular context. The transitivity rule cannot be applied to the links extracted from the dictionary. Indeed, while the synonymy is sometimes very contextual in the dictionary, the links appear in the data without context information and would produce a great deal of errors. Thus, for instance, the synonymy links between the adjectives polaire (polar) and glacial (icy) and the adjectives glacial (cold) and insensible (insensitive) would allow to deduce a wrong synonym link between polaire and insensible.

Then he relies on human expertise for the semantic interpretation. It differs from our work which tries to automatically explicit the semantic relations. In order to disambiguate noun objects in a short text (30 000 words), (Li et al., 1995) design heuristic rules using semantic similarity information in WordNet and verbs as context. Their system disambiguate an encouraging number on noun-verb pairs if one considers single and multiple sense assigned to a word. In (Basili et al., 1997), the lexical knowledge base WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) is used as a bootstrap for verb disambiguation. They tune it to the domain of the studied document by taking into account the contexts in which the verbs are used. This tuning leads both to eliminate certain semantic categories and to add new ones. For instance, the category contact is created for the verb to record. The resulted sense classification is thus a better description of the verb specialized meanings. Our symbolic and dictionary-based approach is close that of (Basin et al., 1997). They both use general language information (traditional dictionary vs. WordNet) for specialized corpo</context>

The main difficulty is to evaluate the recall in the results because there is no standard reference in that matter, giving the overall relevant relations in the document. One may think that the comparison with links manually detected by an expert is the best evaluation, but such manual detection is subjective. Regarding the validation by several experts, it is well-known that such validation would give different results depending on the background of each expert (Szpakowicz et al., 1996). So, we are reduced to compare our results with those obtained by different methods even though they are not perfect either. We are planning to compare the clusters found by our method with the clustering one of (Assadi, 1997) to study how the results overlap and are complementary. 4 Related works The variant detection in specialized corpora must be taken into account for information retrieval.
