PREFACE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946678291666667">
With the advent of the Internet and the predominant representation of on-line information in textual
form, the quality and robustness of natural language understanding systems becomes critical. A major
challenge in building robust systems that interpret text, extract information, summarize and answer
questions is the need to identify the entities referred to by pronouns or other referring expressions. Such
textual references are a pervasive phenomenon that interact with virtually every aspect of semantic and
discourse analysis. While reference resolution algorithms have been applicable to processing discourse
and dialogue for some time, more recently they have became important tools for text-based Information
Extraction systems, Question Answering systems and Summarization systems.
The objective of this ACL workshop on Reference Resolution and its Applications has been to
bring together researchers whose work focuses on the resolution of reference in natural language and to
provide a forum for presenting and discussing the results of recent innovative work. The contributions
in this proceeding cover a range of topics including:
new or extended algorithms for reference resoltution,
new algorithms for resolving ellipted anaphors,
multidocument personal name resolution,
resolving references to referents in preexisting databases,
reference resolution for improving document clustering,
reference resolution for improving name recognition,
reference resolution for the identification of discourse structure.
The workshop organizers would like to thank the program committee for their efforts in reviewing
the submissions. We would also like to thank the participants for their contributions and their generous
collaboration in both the preparation of the proceedings and the activities of the workshop itself.
