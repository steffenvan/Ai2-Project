Although there are two variants of
Dutch, the northern variant being the
one used in the Netherlands and the
southern variant in Flanders (Belgium),
one corpus of spoken Dutch is under
construction, the Spoken Dutch Corpus
(CON). In this paper first the principles
of this corpus will be discussed, there-
after a few small case studies will show
what the merits of such a corpus are.

2 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999453466666667">
Dutch is the official language of approximately 21
million speakers: 15 million in the Netherlands
and 6 million in Flanders, the northern part of
Belgium. Since 1982 an intergovernmental insti-
tution, Nederlandse Taalunie (NTU) (lit. Dutch
Language Union), is responsible for the language
policy in both the Netherlands and Flanders. It
supports, amongst other things, projects leading
to dictionaries, grammars, and other language re-
sources, and it advises the Dutch and Flemish gov-
ernment on language policy issues (a.o. within the
settings of the European Union). In recent years,
the NTU has also become interested in the creation
of an electronic infrastructure for language in or-
der to strengthen the position of Dutch in the in-
ternational information society, in which language
and speech technology (LST) has become increas-
ingly important. By its very nature, the devel-
opment of language and speech technology for a
language has an important national (or even na-
tionalistic) component, but in the case of Dutch
it was the coordinating NTU that decided that
the creation of a series of basic, publicly avail-
able, language resources of good quality, the so-
called BLARK (Basis LAnguage Resources Kit)
for Dutch should be stimulated (Cucchiarini and
D&apos;Halleweyn, 2002), to be of help in creating LST
applications.
Sponsored by the NTU, quite some research has
been done with respect to the creation of such
a BLARK for Dutch (Bouma and Schuurman,
1998). This has resulted in a list of priorities,
formulated by the LST-platform (Daelemans and
Strik, 2002). One of the things that was found to
be lacking (Bouma and Schuurman, 1998) was a
resource for research into spoken language. Dutch
descriptive linguistics has mainly focused on writ-
ten language, while there is as yet hardly any
systematic knowledge of the much more evasive
spoken form of the language. So far for Dutch
only written text corpora are available. But in
1998, work at the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Corpus
Gesproken Nederlands, CON) has started (Oost-
dijk et al., 2002).
CON appears to be unique in that it concerns

two completely equivalent subcorpora (both with
respect to the design of the corpus and the annota-
tion schemes used), which together do constitute
one large corpus. This way many interesting sub-
jects of research with respect to the relation of both
variants can be dealt with, whereas at the same
time a large corpus of the standard language as
such is available as well. In case Flanders and the
Netherlands both would have gone their own way
in creating a corpus, they would have had to spend
more money in order to get a corpus of sufficient
size, whereas it would have been more difficult to
compare both variants of Dutch.

<bodyText confidence="0.999963571428572">
The CGN project (1998-2003) aims at developing
a corpus of approximately 1,000 hours of speech
from adult speakers of standard Dutch, that is circa
10 million words: 2/3 of it will be northern stan-
dard Dutch and 1/3 southern standard Dutch (cf.
the respective numbers of inhabitants). The cor-
pus is to serve as a major resource for Dutch, for
use in a number of widely different fields of in-
terest, including linguistics, language and speech
technology, and education. Its design must an-
ticipate the various research interests arising from
these fields and provide for them, while the dif-
ferent transcriptions and annotations should be as
sophisticated as possible given the present state of
the art. Moreover, its construction conforms to na-
tional and international standards where available,
or else follows recommendations and guidelines or
adopts best practice as it has emerged from other
projects.
All data in the corpus will be orthographically
transcribed, lemmatized and annotated with part-
of-speech (POS) information. For part of the cor-
pus, additional transcriptions and annotations will
be available. Among these is the syntactic an-
notation of 1 million words. &apos;Only&apos; 1 million
words because this layer of annotation is much
more time-consuming than, for example, POS-
annotation (cf. below).

3.1 What will be annotated
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993252">
In speech corpora, orthographic transcription de-
termines to a large extent what will be annotated,
for things that are not transcribed cannot be anno-
tated. And the annotation at the level of POS is
also of importance for the syntactic annotation.

Orthographic conventions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999847642857143">
In the orthographic transcription of CGN, words
are spelled the way they occur in the official
spelling guide for Dutch (Renkema, 1997) and in
case of missing words or obvious mistakes, the
way they occur in the Van Dale dictionary (Geerts
and Den Boon, 1999) . Sometimes some code will
be added:&apos;
Foreign words that are not (yet) part of the
Dutch language (i.e. do not occur in either
de Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal (Renkema,
1997) or Van Dale (Geerts and Den Boon,
1999)) will get a code *v.
Words of which the transcriber is not sure
will get an *x, a word (or a series of words)
that are unintelligible will be represented as
`xxx&apos; or `ggg&apos; (the latter in case of giggles
etc).
In case of mispronunciations (be it on pur-
pose or not) a *u is added.
When a word is interrupted, it is marked with
an *a.
The only punctuation marks used are the full stop
(.), the question mark (?) and the omission mark
(... ). A comma, for example, is not used because
it turned out to be too problematic to assign it in a
consistent way. So-called silent pauses will result
in either a full stop or an omission mark, i.e. they
will never occur within the sentence.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.886301">

Most of the words with codes will get a special

</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9828875">
- Words with *v will get a special tag
SPEC (vreemd). The tagset is not tailored
to suit foreign language, and the proper POS
will not even always be known.

Sometimes, when it is completely unclear
which word was meant, the transcription will
get SPEC (onverst).
- Words with *a will get a tag
SPEC (afgebr).
Syntactic conventions
Words that received the code *v (foreign
words) will be treated like Dutch words, except
when they appear in series. In that case they will
be treated as a MWU (multi word unit). Words
with *a will be neglected, unless the annotator
knows for sure which word was to be realized
(usually when a very small part of the word is
missing).
Disfluencies are dealt with in various ways:
fillers: whether or not a word appears with
an filler like &apos;IA&apos; in it (as in &amp;quot;TV-uh-scherm&amp;quot;
(tv screen)) doesn&apos;t matter for SA, as it has
the same POS tag as the word without such a
filler (in both cases N (soort, ev, stan)).
A filler as a separate element will be ne-
glected at the level of syntax, i.e. it is not part
of the graph assigned to the sentence. Note
that this does not mean that the element is
deleted.
speech repairs: only the corrections will be
taken into account when constructing the
graphs.
- repetitions: only the last occurence will be
taken into account. When complete con-
stituents are repeated they will all be con-
structed up to that level, but only the last one
will be part of the graph assigned to the sen-
tence as a whole.
fresh starts: only the correction will be taken
into account.
silent pauses: see &apos;orthographic conven-
tions&apos;.
It is, however, not the case that sentences are
normalized. Words that do not fit in will not be ne-
glected, even if this leads to &apos;ungrammatical&apos; sen-
tences. And, unlike for example the Switchboard
corpus (Meteer et al., 1995), conjunctions are not
left out in order to start a new sentence. Note that
this way we may end up with sentences of more
than 150 words, and with several subjects and/or
finite verbs.
Sometimes even short sentences will end up
with two subjects and two finite verbs, for example
in the so-called `spiegelzinnen&apos; (lit, mirror sen-
tences).
ik ben eigenhjk ben ik docente Frans
(lit. I am in fact am I teacher French)
In (Huesken, 2001) ample evidence is given for
not considering such sentences as involving a fresh
start.

3.2 How will it be annotated
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8198695">
At the time of the first reflections on the syntactic
annotation of the CGN,
- there was no &apos;full&apos; grammar of spoken Dutch
available, at least not in a formalised way,
most grammars describe the nothern standard
variant (even for written Dutch), cf. the ANS
and also (De Vries, 2001),
- there was no syntactically annotated corpus
of Dutch (written nor spoken) available to
train a statistics based parser on, and
- there was no adequate (automatical) parser
for Dutch available, not even for written
Dutch.2
Therefore, an annotation scheme and manual had
to be developed, which turned out to be a very
time-consuming task, especially because many
constructions which are common in spoken lan-
guage will not show up in grammars dealing
mainly with written language.
2At least not adequate for our purposes: the parser we
were looking for had to be theory neutral and to give access
to categorial as well as functional information. The Ama-
zon parser (Coppen, 2002) for example doesn&apos;t provide func-
tional information.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997593">
103
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982543209877">
The resulting Syntactic Annotation is as the-
ory neutral as possible (in order to be broadly us-
able), sticking rather closely to the ANS (1997),
the widely accepted reference grammar for Dutch.
The annotation scheme for CGN has developed
into a de facto standard for syntactic annotation
of Dutch, and it is now also used by the Alpino
Treebank project (Bouma et al., 2001).
The annotation provides two types of information:
categorial information at the level of syntactic con-
stituency, and dependency information to capture
the semantic connections between constituents.
The CGN tagset tries to strike a balance be-
tween informativeness and practical usability. It
uses 25 phrasal category labels and 34 dependency
labels. Conciseness is obtained by giving the la-
bels a context-sensitive interpretation. The MOD
label, for example, denotes adverbial modifica-
tion in verbal domains, but also adnominal ad-
juncts in noun phrases. Levels of granularity that
are bound to lead to inter-annotator discrepancies
(such as the twenty kinds of adverbial phrases dis-
tinguished in the ANS grammar) are avoided.
The rich POS tagset (with 316 labels (Van Eynde,
2001) is reduced to some 50 distinctions relevant
for the dependency annotation. The reason for do-
ing so is that otherwise, especially in the beginning
of the project, it would have been more difficult to
train the system (sparse data). The full tags, how-
ever, are available as well (via their unique code).
The NEGRA annotation format (Skut et al.,
1997) uses data structures expressive enough to
naturally encode dependency relations, also where
they are at odds with syntactic constituent struc-
ture. Formally, the annotation structures are di-
rected acyclic graphs (DAGs) instead of depen-
dency trees (Hoekstra et al., 2001). The vertices
are decorated with a syntactic category label: a
POS label for the leaves, a phrasal label for the
internal nodes. The edges carry dependency la-
bels. They capture the grammatical function of the
immediate constituents of a phrase, distinguishing
head, complements and adjuncts.
The structures are as flat as possible, i.e. a new
hierarchical level will only be introduced when
this is induced by a new head, and there are no
non-branching nodes.
Special provisions have been made for the annota-
tion of typical spoken language phenomena. The
category label DU (discourse unit) for example, al-
lows for an articulation in terms of dependency
notions such as nucleus versus satellite, tags or
discourse links An overview of the tagset can be
found in (Hoekstra et al., 2001), the full annotation
manual is to be found in (Moortgat et al., 2002).
The annotation makes full use of the expressiv-
ity of DAGs as compared to trees. Discontinu-
ous dependencies result in crossing branches that
would be problematic in a conventional syntac-
tic constituent structure format. Allowing items
to simultaneously carry multiple dependency roles
(like making use of &apos;secondary edges&apos;) results in
a simple annotation schema for phenomena that
would require &apos;movement&apos; or similar devices in
tree-based theoretical frameworks.
Finally, annotation graphs with disconnected
components are useful to provide partial anal-
yses for interrupted phrases, interpolations and
the like. The syntactic annotation proce-
dure, which like the POS tagging is per-
formed semi-automatically, uses the interactive
annotation environment developed within the
German NEGRA project (http://www.coli.uni-
sb.de/sfb378/negra-corp us/negra-corp us. html). A
simple visualisation tool (Portray) for the anno-
tation graphs is freely available from the Utrecht
CGN site (http://cgn.let.uu.n1). In a later phase
of the project, the CGN exploitation software
(COREX tools) will provide more advanced dis-
play and search facilities for the syntactic annota-
tion.

4 Variants of Dutch
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979958636363636">
Dutch as it is used in Flanders is not completely
identical to the language as it is used in the Nether-
lands, especially not when spoken language is
concerned. We will refer to the standard Dutch
language spoken in the Netherlands as the north-
ern variant, and to the language spoken in Flanders
as the southern variant.
Within CGN people are asked to speak &apos;stan-
dard&apos; Dutch. In the Netherlands everybody3 will
interpret this in more or less the same way. But
30nly native speakers of Dutch will be involved.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995987">

<bodyText confidence="0.984190691358024">
not so in Flanders. Due to historical reasons
(Goossens, 2000), (Wils, 2001), there are two ten-
dencies as far as the use of a standard language
is concerned. Some people aim at a standard lan-
guage in Flanders that comes close to (or is even
the same as) the standard language used in the
Netherlands. This is more or less the language that
is used in the newspapers or by the newsreaders
of the public broadcasting companies (Hendrickx,
2000).
On the other hand there is a strong tendency to-
wards the use of a daily speech variant that is non-
dialectical and can be used everywhere in Flan-
ders, but contains more regional aspects than the
first variant (Goossens, 2000). This variant is
known as &apos;Verkavelingsvlaams&apos; (lit. &amp;quot;Allotment
Flemish&amp;quot;). This variant is also often used in light
entertainment programmes on TV, esp. in soap op-
eras.
Dictionaries like Van Dale and reference gram-
mars like the ANS (Haeseryn et al., 1997) mainly
describe the northern variant of Dutch. They do
contain several words and constructions only used
in the southern variant (esp. the first one), but
these will be marked as such (whereas words and
constructions that are only used in the northern
variant are not specifically marked).
A corpus like CGN is a suitable tool to record
the state of affairs at a certain moment in time,
and also under which circumstances which variant
is used (region, age, education, setting, etc.).4 At
this moment it is far from clear which variant will
in the end become the southern variant of the stan-
dard language of the future (cf. also (Van Haver,
1989)).
Most variation between nothern and southern stan-
dard language shows up with respect to pronunci-
ation, vocabulary, and morphology. Some exam-
ples of the latter are given below:
- vocabulary
41t may well be the case that certain constructions that are
said to be typically Flemish also turn up in the southern part
of the Netherlands (&amp;quot;below the rivers&amp;quot;). This part of the coun-
try has several cultural and/or religious resemblances with
Flanders. On the other hand, influences of education, news-
papers etc will be more country-dependent. The way CGN
is conceived allows us to look more closely to the language
used by people living in this area, i.e. in Noord-Brabant and
Limburg.
N1 Fl
sinaasappel appelsien (orange)
stookolie mazout (fuel oil)
accu batten] (battery)
lopen (te voet) gaan (to walk)
rennen, hardlopen lopen (to run)
Note that the different use of lopen may sometimes
lead to confusion!
Quite often words and constructions are valid
in both variants, but the preferences are different:
- preferences wrt plurals

leraren leraars (teachers)
- preferences wrt past tense

Moreover: in Flemish there are still three genders:
masculine, feminine and neuter, whereas in the
Netherlands there are only two genders left: neuter
and non-neuter. Therefore in Flanders one will of-
ten say when refering to a door &amp;quot;Ze staat open&amp;quot;
(She is open) whereas in the Netherlands one will
use &amp;quot;Hij staat open&amp;quot; (He is open).

In order to make (the syntactic part of) CGN ac-
cessible for users with various backgrounds, and
therefore various wishes with respect to the way
the output is presented, the CGN output can be
converted into other formats (categorial grammar,
showing non-branching trees, showing traces, ... )
as well (Moortgat and Moot, 2001). The CGN ex-
ploitation software should also allow for interac-
tion with the other layers of annotation.

6 Some (preliminary) results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966384615385">
The CON corpus is a very powerful means to per-
form - amongst other things - research concerning
the variation between northern standard and south-
ern standard Dutch, which is what we will do in
this section.
However, it should be noted here that since the
CGN project has not been completed yet, the fig-
ures are still somewhat tentative, since the north-
ern part and the southern part of the corpus are
in different stages of development.5 When the
project ends, the northern and southern part of the
corpus should contain an equal amount of tele-
phone conversations and other spontaneous speech
on the one hand, and lectures, speeches and other
more prepared speech on the other hand.
The research was carried out with the use of a
search tool called TIGERSearch. Developed at
the university of Stuttgart, TIGERSearch allows
one to query a given corpus by making use of
the TIGERSearch language (Lezius et al., 2002).
TIGERSearch queries allow one to search for a
given structure, specifying dominance and prece-
dence relations, and properties of nodes. The
specific (suspected) differences between northern
standard and southern standard under considera-
tion will be in the verbal domain.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999866">
6.1 Red versus green word order
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993420142857143">
In Dutch, the combination of a participle and
finite verb in a subordinate clause can occur in
two word orders: the red and the green order.
Red order: 1k geloof niet dat hij is gekomen
Green order: 1k geloof niet dat hij gekomen is
The red order has for a long time been consid-
ered to be the better variant, as the green one was
considered to be a Germanism. More recently it
is stated that both orders are correct, the red order
being the common one in written text, the green
one in spoken language, cf. the ANS (Haeseryn
et al., 1997).
However, our research has shown that in the
Netherlands the ratio between red and green or-
der is almost equal as in the northern part of the
51n order to overcome this problem we verified our find-
ings in those parts of the corpus that have not yet been syn-
tactically analysed, using &apos;grep&apos; and the like.
corpus 292 occurrences of the red order and 286
occurrences of the green one were found. In the
southern standard, however, there appears to be a
clear preference for the green order. Of the 904
sentences with finite verb and participle, 560 had
green order. The 346 remaining sentences had red
order.
Thus, in the northern variant the claim that the
green order is the predominantly used one in spo-
ken language is falsified6.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999204">
6.2 Infinitive vs. te+infinitive
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988372393939394">
Another aspect in which the northern and the
southern standard differ is the presence or absence
of the particle te &apos;to&apos; in front of an infinitive in the
verbal cluster. The ANS (Haeseryn et al., 1997)
contains a table with (auxiliary) verbs and the form
that the accompanying verb takes.
Among the verbs that obligatorily take a
&apos;te+infinitive&apos; (an infinitive preceded by the ver-
bal particle te (to)) mentioned in this table there
are a number that in the southern variant have an
optional te.
For instance
beginnen &apos;to start&apos;
proberen &apos;to try&apos;
vergeten &apos;to forget&apos;
In the ANS such constructions are marked
as substandard, regional ones. In the southern
variant, however, several instances were found,
also in prepared types of speech (news broadcasts,
current affairs programmes). An example:
&amp;quot;en we gaan eruit met beelden van de Etna die
vrijdag weer vuur is beginnen spuwen&amp;quot;
(and we will conclude our broadcast with pictures
of the Etna, which has started to erupt again last
Friday) (from: De zevende dag, VRT)
Especially the verb beginnen often comes with
a bare infinitival complement. 16 out of 17 hits are
with a bare infinitive instead of the expected &apos;te
+ infinitive&apos;. Beginnen also triggers IPP in Dutch
(Infinitivus Pro Participio, a construction in which
a (bare) infinitive appears instead of a participle
°These findings are in line with what we found in the other
parts of the corpus
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994854">

<bodyText confidence="0.996622133333333">
when it is selected by the temporal auxiliary
hebben (to have) or zijn (to be).). It seems that,
by analogy with hebben and zijn, using a bare
infinitival complement has been adopted by other
auxiliaries (such as beginnen) as well.
&amp;quot;ik wil weer beg innen zwemmen&amp;quot;
(I want to start swimming again)
Note that proberen (to try) and vergeten (to try)
trigger the IPP effect as well. In the part of the
corpus that has been syntactically analysed at the
moment these two verbs prefer a &apos;te + infinitive&apos;
as verbal complement. A look in the other parts
of the corpus shows that also proberen has a
tendency to show up with a bare infinitive in the
southern standard.
It even turns out to be possible to have such con-
struction when the trigger is a finite verb.
dat mensen met regels op mensen hun
vingers beginnen kloppen&amp;quot;
(. . , that people start to tap on other peoples
fingers with a ruler)
dat de mensen beginnen nadenken&amp;quot;
(.. . , that people start to think)
&amp;quot;Heb je dat ook dat je namen begint vergeten?&amp;quot;
(Does it also happen to you that you start forget-
ting names?)
These latter constructions, however, have so far
only been found in more spontaneous speech. The
triggering verb is always a plural (whose form is
identical to that of an infinitive)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.953284">
6.3 Om+te+Infinitive vs. om+infinitive
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999868571428571">
Usually, when an infinitival complement starts
with om (for), this om is to be followed by te.
Constructions without te are considered to be
ungrammatical (they are not even mentioned in
the grammar books). But in the Flemish part of
CGN quite some instances of such constructions
are to be found:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.828002">

<bodyText confidence="0.996765714285714">
MO0i om zien, he?&amp;quot; (nice to look at, isn&apos;t it?)
&amp;quot;dat is belangrijk om weten&amp;quot; (it is important to
know that)
So far these constructions were only found in

6.4 Which temporal auxiliary is to be used?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997694">
In Dutch there are two temporal auxiliaries for
the perfect tense hebben (to have) and zijn (to be).
Which one is to be used depends on the verb that
comes with it:
&amp;quot;Hij is gevallen&amp;quot; (He has fallen)
&amp;quot;Hij heeft gegeten&amp;quot; (He has eaten)
When more verbs are involved, there are several
possibilities. It turns out that in the nothern and
the southern standard the choices will not always
be the same. It seems that in the northern standard
the verb that comes with the temporal auxiliary is
decisive, whereas in the southern standard it will
often be the main verb. In CGN, sentences like
the following are found for the southern standard:
news broadcast VRT:
Fl: &amp;quot;hoe het ongeluk is kunnen gebeuren&amp;quot;
(How the accident could have happened)
meeting Flemish parliament:
Fl: &amp;quot;hij heeft komen zeggen dat... &amp;quot;
(He came and said that ... )
Although the first sentence is not impossible in
the northern standard, the second one is.
N1: &amp;quot;hoe het ongeluk heeft/is kunnen gebeuren&amp;quot;
N1: &amp;quot;tnj is/*heeft komen zeggen dat . &amp;quot;

<bodyText confidence="0.9999032">
The observations represented in section 6 are not
to be found as such in the leading Dutch reference
grammar, the ANS (Haeseryn et al., 1997), maybe
because the ANS covers mainly the language as
it is written and because it represents the northern
standard, sometimes mentioning that the situation
is different in the southern variant. Shortly there
will be a syntacticaly annotated corpus describing
spoken language in both the Netherlands and Flan-
ders. Using this Spoken Dutch Corpus a new ref-

erence grammar could (and should) be made. No
need to say that CGN could also be profitable for
a whole series of other uses.

The Amazon parser (Coppen, 2002) for example doesn&apos;t provide functional information. 103 The resulting Syntactic Annotation is as theory neutral as possible (in order to be broadly usable), sticking rather closely to the ANS (1997), the widely accepted reference grammar for Dutch. The annotation scheme for CGN has developed into a de facto standard for syntactic annotation of Dutch, and it is now also used by the Alpino Treebank project (Bouma et al., 2001). The annotation provides two types of information: categorial information at the level of syntactic constituency, and dependency information to capture the semantic conne</context>

And the annotation at the level of POS is also of importance for the syntactic annotation. Orthographic conventions In the orthographic transcription of CGN, words are spelled the way they occur in the official spelling guide for Dutch (Renkema, 1997) and in case of missing words or obvious mistakes, the way they occur in the Van Dale dictionary (Geerts and Den Boon, 1999) . Sometimes some code will be added:&apos; Foreign words that are not (yet) part of the Dutch language (i.e. do not occur in either de Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal (Renkema, 1997) or Van Dale (Geerts and Den Boon, 1999)) will get a code *v. Words of which the transcriber is not sure will get an *x, a word (or a series of words) that are unintelligible will be represented as `xxx&apos; or `ggg&apos; (the latter in case of giggles etc).

Levels of granularity that are bound to lead to inter-annotator discrepancies (such as the twenty kinds of adverbial phrases distinguished in the ANS grammar) are avoided. The rich POS tagset (with 316 labels (Van Eynde, 2001) is reduced to some 50 distinctions relevant for the dependency annotation. The reason for doing so is that otherwise, especially in the beginning of the project, it would have been more difficult to train the system (sparse data). The full tags, however, are available as well (via their unique code). The NEGRA annotation format (Skut et al., 1997) uses data structures expressive enough to naturally encode dependency relations, also where they are at odds with syntactic constituent structure. Formally, the annotation structures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) instead of dependency trees (Hoekstra et al., 2001). The vertices are decorated with a syntactic category label: a POS label for the leaves, a phrasal label for the internal nodes. The edges carry dependency labels. They capture the grammatical function of the immediate constituents of a phrase, distinguishing head, complements and adjuncts. The structures are as flat as possibl</context>

We will refer to the standard Dutch language spoken in the Netherlands as the northern variant, and to the language spoken in Flanders as the southern variant. Within CGN people are asked to speak &apos;standard&apos; Dutch. In the Netherlands everybody3 will interpret this in more or less the same way. But 30nly native speakers of Dutch will be involved. 104 not so in Flanders. Due to historical reasons (Goossens, 2000), (Wils, 2001), there are two tendencies as far as the use of a standard language is concerned. Some people aim at a standard language in Flanders that comes close to (or is even the same as) the standard language used in the Netherlands. This is more or less the language that is used in the newspapers or by the newsreaders of the public broadcasting companies (Hendrickx, 2000). On the other hand there is a strong tendency towards the use of a daily speech variant that is nondialectical and can be used everywhere in Flanders, but contains more regional aspects than the first variant (Goossens, 2000).
