This paper presents the end-to-end evalu-
ation of an automatic simultaneous trans-
lation system, built with state-of-the-art
components. It shows whether, and for
which situations, such a system might be
advantageous when compared to a human

translated into Spanish, we present the

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997265625">
Anyone speaking at least two different languages
knows that translation and especially simultaneous
interpretation are very challenging tasks. A human
translator has to cope with the special nature of
different languages, comprising phenomena like
terminology, compound words, idioms, dialect
terms or neologisms, unexplained acronyms or ab-
breviations, proper names, as well as stylistic and
punctuation differences. Further, translation or in-
terpretation are not a word-by-word rendition of
what was said or written in a source language. In-
stead, the meaning and intention of a given sen-
tence have to be reexpressed in a natural and fluent
way in another language.
Most professional full-time conference inter-
preters work for international organizations like
the United Nations, the European Union, or the
African Union, whereas the world’s largest em-
ployer of translators and interpreters is currently
the European Commission. In 2006, the European
Parliament spent about 300 million Euros, 30% of
its budget, on the interpretation and translation of
the parliament speeches and EU documents. Gen-
erally, about 1.1 billion Euros are spent per year
on the translating and interpreting services within
the European Union, which is around 1% of the
total EU-Budget (Volker Steinbiss, 2006).
This paper presents the end-to-end evaluation
of an automatic simultaneous translation system,
built with state-of-the-art components. It shows
whether, and in which cases, such a system might
be advantageous compared to human interpreters.

2 Challenges in Human Interpretation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728857142857">
According to Al-Khanji et al. (2000), researchers
in the field of psychology, linguistics and interpre-
tation seem to agree that simultaneous interpre-
tation (SI) is a highly demanding cognitive task
involving a basic psycholinguistic process. This
process requires the interpreter to monitor, store
and retrieve the input of the source language in
a continuous manner in order to produce the oral
rendition of this input in the target language. It is
clear that this type of difficult linguistic and cog-
nitive operation will force even professional in-
terpreters to elaborate lexical or synthetic search
strategies.
Fatigue and stress have a negative effect on the
interpreter, leading to a decrease in simultaneous
interpretation quality. In a study by Moser-Mercer
et al. (1998), in which professional speakers were
asked to work until they could no longer provide
acceptable quality, it was shown that (1) during
the first 20 minutes the frequency of errors rose
steadily, (2) the interpreters, however, seemed to
be unaware of this decline in quality, (3) after 60
minutes, all subjects made a total of 32.5 mean-
ing errors, and (4) in the category of nonsense the
number of errors almost doubled after 30 minutes
on the task.
Since the audience is only able to evaluate the
simultaneously interpreted discourse by its form,

the fluency of an interpretation is of utmost im-
portance. According to a study by Kopczynski
(1994), fluency and style were third on a list of
priorities (after content and terminology) of el-
ements rated by speakers and attendees as con-
tributing to quality. Following the overview in
(Yagi, 2000), an interpretation should be as natu-
ral and as authentic as possible, which means that
artificial pauses in the middle of a sentence, hes-
itations, and false-starts should be avoided, and
tempo and intensity of the speaker’s voice should
be imitated.
Another point to mention is the time span be-
tween a source language chunk and its target lan-
guage chunk, which is often referred to as ear-
voice-span. Following the summary in (Yagi,
2000), the ear-voice-span is variable in duration
depending on some source and target language
variables, like speech delivery rate, information
density, redundancy, word order, syntactic charac-
teristics, etc. Short delays are usually preferred for
several reasons. For example, the audience is irri-
tated when the delay is too large and is soon asking
whether there is a problem with the interpretation.

3 Automatic Simultaneous Translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879153846154">
Given the explanations above on human interpre-
tation, one has to weigh two factors when consid-
ering the use of simultaneous translation systems:
translation quality and cost.
The major disadvantage of an automatic system
compared to human interpretation is its translation
quality, as we will see in the following sections.
Current state-of-the-art systems may reach satis-
factory quality for people not understanding the
lecturer at all, but are still worse than human inter-
pretation. Nevertheless, an automatic system may
have considerable advantages.
One such advantage is its considerable short-
term memory: storing long sequences of words is
not a problem for a computer system. Therefore,
compensatory strategies are not necessary, regard-
less of the speaking rate of the speaker. However,
depending on the system’s translation speed, la-
tency may increase. While it is possible for hu-
mans to compress the length of an utterance with-
out changing its meaning (summarization), it is
still a challenging task for automatic systems.
Human simultaneous interpretation is quite ex-
pensive, especially due to the fact that usually two
interpreters are necessary. In addition, human in-
terpreters require preparation time to become fa-
miliar with the topic. Moreover, simultaneous in-
terpretation requires a soundproof booth with au-
dio equipment, which adds an overall cost that is
unacceptable for all but the most elaborate multi-
lingual events. On the other hand, a simultaneous
translation system also needs time and effort for
preparation and adaptation towards the target ap-
plication, language and domain. However, once
adapted, it can be easily re-used in the same do-
main, language, etc. Another advantage is that the
transcript of a speech or lecture is produced for
free by using an automatic system in the source
and target languages.

3.1 The Simultaneous Translation System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976473684211">
Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of the si-
multaneous translation system developed at Uni-
versität Karlsruhe (TH) (Fügen et al., 2006b). The
speech of the lecturer is recorded with the help
of a close-talk microphone and processed by the
speech recognition component (ASR). The par-
tial hypotheses produced by the ASR module are
collected in the resegmentation component, for
merging and re-splitting at appropriate “seman-
tic” boundaries. The resegmented hypotheses are
then transferred to one or more machine transla-
tion components (MT), at least one per language
pair. Different output technologies may be used
for presenting the translations to the audience. For
a detailed description of the components as well
as the client-server framework used for connect-
ing the components please refer to (Fügen et al.,
2006b; Fügen et al., 2006a; Kolss et al., 2006; Fü-
gen and Kolss, 2007; Fügen et al., 2001).

3.2 End-to-End Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999496">
The evaluation in speech-to-speech translation
jeopardises many concepts and implies a lot of
subjectivity. Three components are involved and
an overall system may grow the difficulty of esti-
mating the output quality. However, two criteria
are mainly accepted in the community: measuring
the information preservation and determining how
much of the translation is understandable.
Several end-to-end evaluations in speech-to-
speech translation have been carried out in the last
few years, in projects such as JANUS (Gates et
al., 1996), Verbmobil (Nübel, 1997) or TC-STAR
(Hamon et al., 2007). Those projects use the
main criteria depicted above, and protocols differ
in terms of data preparation, rating, procedure, etc.

To our opinion, to evaluate the performance of a
complete speech-to-speech translation system, we
need to compare the source speech used as input to
the translated output speech in the target language.
To that aim, we reused a large part of the evalua-
tion protocol from the TC-STAR project(Hamon
et al., 2007).

4 Evaluation Tasks

The evaluation is carried out on the simultaneously
translated speech of a single speaker’s talks and
lectures in the field of speech processing, given in
English, and translated into Spanish.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99849">
4.1 Data used
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993611111111">
Two data sets were selected from the talks and
lectures. Each set contained three excerpts, no
longer than 6 minutes each and focusing on dif-
ferent topics. The former set deals with speech
recognition and the latter with the descriptions of
European speech research projects, both from the
same speaker. This represents around 7,200 En-
glish words. The excerpts were manually tran-
scribed to produce the reference for the ASR eval-
uation. Then, these transcriptions were manually
translated into Spanish by two different transla-
tors. Two reference translations were thus avail-
able for the spoken language translation (SLT)
evaluation. Finally, one human interpretation was
produced from the excerpts as reference for the
end-to-end evaluation. It should be noted that for
the translation system, speech synthesis was used
to produce the spoken output.

4.2 Evaluation Protocol
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938794117647">
The system is evaluated as a whole (black box
evaluation) and component by component (glass
box evaluation):
ASR evaluation. The ASR module is evaluated
by computing the Word Error Rate (WER) in case
insensitive mode.
SLT evaluation. For the SLT evaluation, the au-
tomatically translated text from the ASR output is
compared with two manual reference translations
by means of automatic and human metrics. Two
automatic metrics are used: BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2001) and mWER (Niessen et al., 2000).
For the human evaluation, each segment is eval-
uated in relation to adequacy and fluency (White
and O’Connell, 1994). For the evaluation of ad-
equacy, the target segment is compared to a ref-
erence segment. For the evaluation of fluency,
the quality of the language is evaluated. The two
types of evaluation are done independently, but
each evaluator did both evaluations (first that of
fluency, then that of adequacy) for a certain num-
ber of segments. For the evaluation of fluency,
evaluators had to answer the question: “Is the text
written in good Spanish?”. For the evaluation of
adequacy, evaluators had to answer the question:
“How much of the meaning expressed in the ref-
erence translation is also expressed in the target
translation?”.
For both evaluations, a five-point scale is pro-
posed to the evaluators, where only extreme val-
ues are explicitly defined. Three evaluations are
carried out per segment, done by three different
evaluators, and segments are divided randomly,
because evaluators must not recreate a “story”

and thus be influenced by the context. The total
number of judges was 10, with around 100 seg-
ments per judge. Furthermore, the same number
of judges was recruited for both categories: ex-
perts, from the domain with a knowledge of the
technology, and non-experts, without that knowl-
edge.
End-to-End evaluation. The End-to-End eval-
uation consists in comparing the speech in the
source language to the output speech in the tar-
get language. Two important aspects should be
taken into account when assessing the quality of
a speech-to-speech system.
First, the information preservation is measured
by using “comprehension questionnaires”. Ques-
tions are created from the source texts (the En-
glish excerpts), then questions and answers are
translated into Spanish by professional translators.
These questions are asked to human judges after
they have listened to the output speech in the tar-
get language (Spanish). At a second stage, the an-
swers are analysed: for each answer a Spanish val-
idator gives a score according to a binary scale (the
information is either correct or incorrect). This al-
lows us to measure the information preservation.
Three types of questions are used in order to di-
versify the difficulty of the questions and test the
system at different levels: simple Factual (70%),
yes/no (20%) and list (10%) questions. For in-
stance, questions were: What is the larynx respon-
sible for?, Have all sites participating in CHIL
built a CHIL room?, Which types of knowledge
sources are used by the decoder?, respectively.
The second important aspect of a speech-to-
speech system is the quality of the speech output
(hereafter quality evaluation). For assessing the
quality of the speech output one question is asked
to the judges at the end of each comprehension
questionnaire: “Rate the overall quality of this au-
dio sample”, and values go from 1 (“1: Very bad,
unusable”) to 5 (“It is very useful”). Both auto-
matic system and interpreter outputs were evalu-
ated with the same methodology.
Human judges are real users and native Span-
ish speakers, experts and non-experts, but different
from those of the SLT evaluation. Twenty judges
were involved (12 excerpts, 10 evaluations per ex-
cerpt and 6 evaluations per judge) and each judge
evaluated both automatic and human excerpts on a
50/50 percent basis.

Each segment within the human evaluation is eval-
uated 4 times, each by a different judge. This aims
at having a significant number of judgments and
measuring the consistency of the human evalua-
tions. The consistency is measured by computing
the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960).
Results show a substantial agreement for flu-
ency (kappa of 0.64) and a moderate agreement
for adequacy (0.52).The overall results of the hu-
man evaluation are presented in Table 2. Regard-
ing both experts’ and non-experts’ details, agree-
ment is very similar (0.30 and 0.28, respectively).

Both fluency and adequacy results are over the
mean. They are lower for experts than for non-

are more familiar with the domain and therefore
more demanding than non experts. Regarding the
detailed evaluation per judge, scores are generally
lower for non-experts than for experts.

6.1 Evaluators Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971285714286">
In this study, ten judges carried out the evaluation
for each excerpt. In order to observe the inter-
judges agreement, the global Fleiss’s Kappa co-
efficient was computed, which allows to measure
the agreement between m judges with r criteria of
judgment. This coefficient shows a global agree-
ment between all the judges, which goes beyond
Cohen’s Kappa coefficient. However, a low co-
efficient requires a more detailed analysis, for in-
stance, by using Kappa for each pair of judges.
Indeed, this allows to see how deviant judges are
from the typical judge behaviour. For m judges,
n evaluations and r criteria, the global Kappa is
defined as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9621655">
nm2 n r X2
- �i=1 �j=1 ij
nm(m − 1) Er j=1 Pj(1 − Pj)
where:
Pj =
nm
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999695307692308">
and: Xij is the number of judgments for the ith
evaluation and the jth criteria.
Regarding quality evaluation (n = 6, m = 10,
r = 5), Kappa values are low for both human in-
terpreters (K = 0.07) and the automatic system
(K = 0.01), meaning that judges agree poorly
(Landis and Koch, 1977). This is explained by
the extreme subjectivity of the evaluation and the
small number of evaluated excerpts. Looking at
each pair of judges and the Kappa coefficients
themselves, there is no real agreement, since most
of the Kappa values are around zero. However,
some judge pairs show fair agreement, and some
others show moderate or substantial agreement. It
is observed, though, that some criteria are not fre-
quently selected by the judges, which limits the
statistical significance of the Kappa coefficient.
The limitations are not the same for the com-
prehension evaluation (n = 60, m = 10, r = 2),
since the criteria are binary (i.e. true or false). Re-
garding the evaluated excerpts, Kappa values are
0.28 for the automatic system and 0.30 for the in-
terpreter. According to Landis and Koch (1977),
those values mean that judges agree fairly. In
order to go further, the Kappa coefficients were
computed for each pair of judges. Results were
slightly better for the interpreter than for the au-
tomatic system. Most of them were between 0.20
and 0.40, implying a fair agreement. Some judges
agreed moderately.
Furthermore, it was also observed that for the
120 available questions, 20 had been answered
correctly by all the judges (16 for the interpreter
evaluation and 4 for the automatic system one)
and 6 had been answered wrongly by all judges (1
for the former and 5 for the latter). That shows a
trend where the interpreter comprehension would
be easier than that of the automatic system, or at
least where the judgements are less questionable.

L043, which is more technical than T036. The
L043-3 excerpt is particularly technical, with for-
mulae and algorithm descriptions, and even a com-
plex description of the human articulatory system.
In fact, L043 provides a typical presentation with
an introduction, followed by a deeper description
of the topic. This increasing complexity is re-
flected on the quality scores of the three excerpts,
going from 3.1 to 2.4.
T036 is more fluent due to the less technical na-
ture of the speech and the more general vocabu-
lary used. However, the T036-2 and T036-3 ex-
cerpts get a lower quality score, due to the descrip-
tion of data collections or institutions, and thus the
use of named entities. The interpreter does not
seem to be at ease with them and is mispronounc-
ing some of them, such as “Grenoble” pronounced
like in English instead of in Spanish. The inter-
preter seems to be influenced by the speaker, as
can also be seen in his use of the neologism “el ce-
nario” (“the scenario”) instead of “el escenario”.
Likewise, “Karlsruhe” is pronounced three times
differently, showing some inconsistency of the in-
terpreter.
The general trend in quality errors is similar to
those of previous evaluations: lengthening words
(“seeeeñales”), hesitations, pauses between syl-
lables and catching breath (“caracterís...ticas”),
careless mistakes (“probibilidad” instead of “prob-
abilidad”), self-correction of wrong interpreting
(“reconocien-/reconocimiento”), etc.
An important issue concerns gender and num-
ber agreement. Those errors are explained by
the presence of morphological gender in Spanish,
like in “estos señales” instead of “estas señales”
(“these signals”) together with the speaker’s speed
of speech. The speaker seems to start by default
with a masculine determiner (which has no gen-
der in English), adjusting the gender afterward de-
pending on the noun following. A quick transla-
tion may also be the cause for this kind of errors,
like “del señal acustico” (“of the acoustic signal”)
with a masculine determiner, a feminine substan-
tive and ending in a masculine adjective. Some
translation errors are also present, for instance
“computerizar” instead of “calcular” (“compute”).
The errors made by the interpreter help to un-
derstand how difficult oral translation is. This
should be taken into account for the evaluation of
the automatic system.
The automatic system results, like those of
the interpreter, are higher for T036 than for L043.
However, scores are lower, especially for the
L043-1 excerpt. This seems to be due to the
type of lexicon used by the speaker for this ex-
cerpt, more medical, since the speaker describes
the articulatory system. Moreover, his description
is sometimes metaphorical and uses a rather col-
loquial register. Therefore, while the interpreter
finds it easier to deal with these excerpts (known
vocabulary among others) and L043-3 seems to be
more complicated (domain-specific, technical as-
pect), the automatic system finds it more compli-
cated with the former and less with the latter. In
other words, the interpreter has to “understand”
what is said in L043-3, contrary to the automatic
system, in order to translate.
Scores are higher for the T036 excerpts. In-
deed, there is a high lexical repetition, a large
number of named entities, and the quality of the
excerpt is very training-dependant. However, the
system runs into trouble to process foreign names,
which are very often not understandable. Differ-
ences between T036-1 and the other T036 excerpts
are mainly due to the change in topic. While the
former deals with a general vocabulary (i.e. de-
scription of projects), the other two excerpts de-
scribe the data collection, the evaluation metrics,
etc., thus increasing the complexity of translation.
Generally speaking, quality scores of the au-
tomatic system are mainly due to the transla-
tion component, and to a lesser extent to the
recognition component. Many English words are
not translated (“bush”, “keyboards”, “squeaking”,
etc.), and word ordering is not always correct.
This is the case for the sentence “how we solve
it”, translated into “cómo nos resolvers lo” instead
of “cómo lo resolvemos”. Funnily enough, the
problems of gender (“maravillosos aplicaciones”
- masc. vs fem.) and number (“pueden real-
mente ser aplicado” - plu. vs sing.) the in-
terpreter has, are also found for the automatic
system. Moreover, the translation of compound
nouns often shows wrong word ordering, in partic-
ular when they are long, i.e. up to three words (e.g.
“reconocimiento de habla sistemas” for “speech
recognition system” instead of “sistemas de re-
conocimiento de habla”).
Finally, some error combinations result in fully
non-understandable sentences, such as:
“usted tramo se en emacs es squeaking
ruido y dries todos demencial”
</bodyText>

where the following errors take place:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.914238294117647">
• tramo: this translation of “stretch” results
from the choice of a substantive instead of a
verb, giving rise to two choices due to the lex-
ical ambiguity: “estiramiento” and “tramo”,
which is more a linear distance than a stretch
in that context;
• se: the pronoun “it” becomes the reflexive
“se” instead of the personal pronoun “lo”;
• emacs: the recognition module transcribed
the couple of words “it makes” into “emacs”,
not translated by the translation module;
• squeaking: the word is not translated by the
translation module;
• dries: again, two successive errors are made:
the word “drives” is transcribed into “dries”
by the recognition module, which is then left
untranslated.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999876384615385">
The TTS component also contributes to decreas-
ing the output quality. The prosody module finds it
hard to make the sentences sound natural. Pauses
between words are not very frequent, but they do
not sound natural (i.e. like catching breath) and
they are not placed at specific points, as it would
be done by a human. For instance, the prosody
module does not link the noun and its determiner
(e.g. “otros aplicaciones”). Finally, a not user-
friendly aspect of the TTS component is the rep-
etition of the same words always pronounced in
the same manner, what is quite disturbing for the
listener.

Tables 5 and 6 present the results of the compre-
hension evaluation, for the interpreter and for the
automatic system, respectively. They provide the
following information:
identifiers of the excerpt: Source data are the
same for the interpreter and the automatic
system, namely the English speech;
subj. E2E: The subjective results of the end-to-
end evaluation are done by the same assessors
who did the quality evaluation. This shows
the percentage of good answers;
fair E2E: The objective verification of the an-
swers. The audio files are validated to check
whether they contain the answers to the ques-
tions or not (as the questions were created
from the English source). This shows the
maximum percentage of answers an evalua-
tor managed to find from either the interpreter
(speaker audio) or the automatic system out-
put (TTS) in Spanish. For instance, informa-
tion in English could have been missed by
the interpreter because he/she felt that this in-
formation was meaningless and could be dis-
carded. We consider those results as an ob-
jective evaluation.
SLT, ASR: Verification of the answers in each
component of the end-to-end process. In or-
der to determine where the information for
the automatic system is lost, files from each
component (recognised files for ASR, trans-
lated files for SLT, and synthesised files for
TTS in the “fair E2E” column) are checked.

Regarding the automatic system results (Table

above 50% since, by extension, more than half the
questions were correctly answered. The lowest
excerpt, L043-1, gets a rate of 25%, the highest,
T036-1, a rate of 76%, which is in agreement with
the observation for the quality evaluation. Infor-

from answering related questions. Moreover, the
ASR module loses 17% of the information. Those
results are certainly due to the specific vocabulary
used in this experiment.
So as to objectively compare the interpreter with
the automatic system, we selected the questions
for which the answers were included in the inter-
preter files (i.e. those in the “fair E2E” column
of Table 5). The goal was to compare the overall
quality of the speech-to-speech translation to in-
terpreters’ quality, without the noise factor of the
information missing. The assumption is that the
interpreter translates the “important information”
and skips the useless parts of the original speech.
This experiment is to measure the level of this in-
formation that is preserved by the automatic sys-
tem. So a new subset of results was obtained, on
the information kept by the interpreter. The same
study was repeated for the three components and
the results are shown in Tables 7 and 8.

Comparing the automatic system to the inter-
preter, the automatic system keeps 40% of the in-
formation where the interpreter translates the doc-
uments correctly. Those results confirm that ASR
loses a lot of information (20%), while SLT loses
10% further, and so does the TTS. Judges are quite
close to the objective validation and found most of
the answers they could possibly do.

Subjective results for the restricted evaluation
are similar to the previous results, on the full data
(80% vs 74% of the information found by the
judges). Performance is good for the interpreter:
98% of the information correctly translated by the
automatic system is also correctly interpreted by
the human. Although we can not compare the
performance of the restricted automatic system to
that of the restricted interpreter (since data sets of
questions are different), it seems that of the inter-
preter is better. However, the loss due to subjective
evaluation seems to be higher for the interpreter
than for the automatic system.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976411764706">
Regarding the SLT evaluation, the results achieved
with the simultaneous translation system are still
rather low compared to the results achieved with
offline systems for translating European parlia-
ment speeches in TC-STAR. However, the offline
systems had almost no latency constraints, and
parliament speeches are much easier to recognize
and translate when compared to the more spon-
taneous talks and lectures focused in this paper.
This clearly shows the difficulty of the whole task.
However, the human end-to-end evaluation of the
system in which the system is compared with hu-
man interpretation shows that the current transla-
tion quality allows for understanding of at least
half of the content, and therefore, may be already
quite helpful for people not understanding the lan-
guage of the lecturer at all.

It shows whether, and for which situations, such a system might be advantageous when compared to a human interpreter. Using speeches in English translated into Spanish, we present the evaluation procedure and we discuss the results both for the recognition and translation components as well as for the overall system.

Generally, about 1.1 billion Euros are spent per year on the translating and interpreting services within the European Union, which is around 1% of the total EU-Budget (Volker Steinbiss, 2006). This paper presents the end-to-end evaluation of an automatic simultaneous translation system, built with state-of-the-art components. It shows whether, and in which cases, such a system might be advantageous compared to human interpreters. 2 Challenges in Human Interpretation According to Al-Khanji et al. (2000), researchers in the field of psychology, linguistics and interpretation seem to agree that simultaneous interpretation (SI) is a highly demanding cognitive task involving a basic psycholinguistic process. This process requires the interpreter to monitor, store and retrieve the input of the source language in a continuous manner in order to produce the oral rendition of this input in the target language. It is clear that this type of difficult linguistic and cognitive operation will force even professional interpreters to elaborate lexical or synthetic search strategies.

The partial hypotheses produced by the ASR module are collected in the resegmentation component, for merging and re-splitting at appropriate “semantic” boundaries. The resegmented hypotheses are then transferred to one or more machine translation components (MT), at least one per language pair. Different output technologies may be used for presenting the translations to the audience. For a detailed description of the components as well as the client-server framework used for connecting the components please refer to (Fügen et al., 2006b; Fügen et al., 2006a; Kolss et al., 2006; Fü- gen and Kolss, 2007; Fügen et al., 2001). 3.2 End-to-End Evaluation The evaluation in speech-to-speech translation jeopardises many concepts and implies a lot of subjectivity.

Indeed, this allows to see how deviant judges are from the typical judge behaviour. For m judges, n evaluations and r criteria, the global Kappa is defined as follows: nm2 n r X2 - �i=1 �j=1 ij nm(m − 1) Er j=1 Pj(1 − Pj) where: Pj = nm and: Xij is the number of judgments for the ith evaluation and the jth criteria. Regarding quality evaluation (n = 6, m = 10, r = 5), Kappa values are low for both human interpreters (K = 0.07) and the automatic system (K = 0.01), meaning that judges agree poorly (Landis and Koch, 1977). This is explained by the extreme subjectivity of the evaluation and the small number of evaluated excerpts. Looking at each pair of judges and the Kappa coefficients themselves, there is no real agreement, since most of the Kappa values are around zero. However, some judge pairs show fair agreement, and some others show moderate or substantial agreement. It is observed, though, that some criteria are not frequently selected by the judges, which limits the statistical significance of the Kappa coefficient. The limitations are not the same for the comprehension evaluation (n = 60, m = 10, r = </context>

This process requires the interpreter to monitor, store and retrieve the input of the source language in a continuous manner in order to produce the oral rendition of this input in the target language. It is clear that this type of difficult linguistic and cognitive operation will force even professional interpreters to elaborate lexical or synthetic search strategies. Fatigue and stress have a negative effect on the interpreter, leading to a decrease in simultaneous interpretation quality. In a study by Moser-Mercer et al. (1998), in which professional speakers were asked to work until they could no longer provide acceptable quality, it was shown that (1) during the first 20 minutes the frequency of errors rose steadily, (2) the interpreters, however, seemed to be unaware of this decline in quality, (3) after 60 minutes, all subjects made a total of 32.5 meaning errors, and (4) in the category of nonsense the number of errors almost doubled after 30 minutes on the task.

According to a study by Kopczynski (1994), fluency and style were third on a list of priorities (after content and terminology) of elements rated by speakers and attendees as contributing to quality. Following the overview in (Yagi, 2000), an interpretation should be as natural and as authentic as possible, which means that artificial pauses in the middle of a sentence, hesitations, and false-starts should be avoided, and tempo and intensity of the speaker’s voice should be imitated. Another point to mention is the time span between a source language chunk and its target language chunk, which is often referred to as earvoice-span. Following the summary in (Yagi, 2000), the ear-voice-span is variable in duration depending on some source and target language variables, like speech delivery rate, information density, redundancy, w</context>
