The paper reports on a multi-layered corpus of
Italian, annotated at the syntactic and lexico-

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980736842105">
It is nowadays widely acknowledged that
linguistically annotated corpora have a crucial
theoretical as well as applicative role in Natural
Language Processing. Italian still lacks such a
resource. The paper describes a large scale effort
to provide Italian with a multi-level annotated
corpus, the Italian Syntactic-Semantic Treebank
(henceforth referred to as ISST). Evaluation of
ISST is foreseen in the framework of a machine
translation application. Specifically developed
software, including an intelligent interface,
supports both annotation and evaluation
activities.
ISST - which represents one of the main actions
of an ongoing Italian national project, SI-TAL1 -
is developed by a consortium of companies and
computational linguistics sites in Italy (see
author&apos;s affiliations above). 1], 4] and 5] are in
charge of the annotation, 3] of the design and

construction of the annotation software and 2] of
the evaluation of the developed resource.
Expected uses for ISST range from Natural
Language Processing tasks (such as Information
Retrieval, Word Sense Disambiguation,
linguistic knowledge acquisition) to training
(and/or tuning) of grammars and sense
disambiguation systems, to the evaluation of
language technology systems. ISST also promises
to contribute to the start up of commercial
systems for Italian processing. Last but not least,
although annotated corpora are typically built
and used in research and applicative contexts,
their potential for teaching purposes has also to
be emphasised; see, for instance, their use in the
classroom for teaching syntax at Nijmegen
University (Van Halteren 1997).
The final and tested version of ISST will be
available in year 2001. Currently, the annotation
phase is started, based on the linguistic
guidelines and the annotation software which
have just been released; yet, initial specifications
remain subject to extensions and further
refinements on the basis of feedback coming
from the annotation process (e.g. emergence
from the corpus of linguistic phenomena not yet
covered by the specifications).

1 Architecture of ISST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913714285714">
ISST has a three-level structure ranging over
syntactic and semantic levels of linguistic
description. Syntactic annotation is distributed
over two different levels, namely the constituent
structure level and the functional relations level:
constituent structure is annotated in terms of
phrase structure trees reflecting the ordered
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998184">
18
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962055555555">
arrangement of words and phrases within the
sentence, whereas functional annotation
provides a characterisation of the sentence in
terms of grammatical functions (i.e. subject,
object, etc.). The third level deals with lexico-
semantic annotation, which is carried out here in
terms of sense tagging augmented with other
types of semantic information. The three
annotation levels are independent of each other,
and all refer to the same input, namely a
morpho-syntactically annotated (i.e. pos-tagged)
text which is linked to the orthographic file with
the text and mark-up of macrotextual
organisation (e.g. titles, subtitles, summary,
body of article, paragraphs). The final resource
will be available in XML coding.
The multi-level structure of ISST shows two
main novelties with respect to other treebanks:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.608259">
• it combines within the same resource
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9617968">
syntactic and lexico-semantic annotations,
thus creating the prerequisites for corpus-
based investigations on the syntax-semantics
interface (e.g. on the semantic types
associated with functional positions of a
given predicate, or on specific
subcategorisation properties associated with a
specific word sense);
• it adopts a distributed approach to syntactic
annotation which presents several advantages
with respect both to the representation of the
syntactic properties of a language like Italian
(e.g. its highly free constituent order) and to
the compatibility with a wide range of
approaches to syntax.

2.1 Corpus composition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999520588235294">
ISST corpus consists of about 300,000 word
tokens reflecting contemporary language use. It
includes two different sections: 1) a &amp;quot;balanced&amp;quot;
corpus, testifying general language usage, for a
total of about 210,000 tokens; 2) a specialised
corpus, amounting to 90,000 tokens, with texts
belonging to the financial domain.
The balanced corpus contains a selection of
articles from different types of Italian texts,
namely newspapers (La Repubblica and Il
Corriere della Sera) and a number of different
periodicals which were selected to cover a high
variety of topics (politics, economy, culture,
science, health, sport, leisure, etc.). The financial
corpus includes articles taken from Il Sole-24
Ore. All in all, they cover a 10 year time period
(1985-1995).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998576">
2.2 Morpho-syntactic annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999803038461538">
Syntactic and lexico-semantic annotation takes
as input the morpho-syntactically annotated text.
Morpho-syntactic annotation was previously
carried out at ILC in the framework of the
European projects PAROLE (Goggi et al. 1997)
and ELSNET (Monachini and Corazzari 1995).
The text was automatically tagged; the output
was manually revised by a team of linguists. The
adopted morpho-syntactic tagset conforms to the
EAGLES international standard (Monachini and
Calzolari 1996).
Annotation at this level involves identification
of morphological words with specification of
part of speech, lemma, and morho-syntactic
features such as number, person, gender, etc.
Morphological words typically stand in a one-to-
one relation with orthographic words with two
exceptions, namely: i) the case of more than one
morphological word which forms part of the
same orthographic word (as in the case of
cliticized words, e.g. dammelo &apos;give+to_me+it&apos;);
ii) the case of more than one orthographic word
which make up a single morphological word not
otherwise decomposable (as in the case of multi-
word expressions such as ad_hoc, al_di_lˆ
&apos;beyond&apos;, fino_a &apos;up_to&apos;).

3 ISST annotation schemata
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.964726">
3.1 General requirements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995922">
The design of each individual annotation schema
underlying ISST and their interrelations are
intended to fit a list of basic requirements
following directly from the typology of foreseen
uses. They include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990768">
a) usability in both real applications and
research purposes;
b) compatibility with different approaches to
syntax, both dependency- and constituency-
based, either adopted in theoretical or
applicative frameworks;
c) applicability on a wide scale, in a coherent
and replicable way;
d) applicability to both written and spoken
language (this requirement does not apply to
the actual ISST but it is foreseen in view of
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.998612">
19
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958638888889">
possible resource extensions to spoken
language data).
Within ISST, requirements a) and b) are satisfied
by distributing the annotation over different
levels (mainly for what concerns syntactic
annotation) and, for each level, by factoring out
different information types according to
different dimensions.
Different strategies are pursued to meet
requirement c). This is achieved at the level of
individual annotation schemes by first providing
wide coverage and detailed annotation criteria
and then by avoiding as much as possible
arbitrary annotation decisions (i.e. uncertainty
cases are preferably dealt with through
underspecification or disjunction over different
interpretations). c) has also consequences on the
relationship between different annotation levels:
redundancy is avoided as much as possible; i.e. a
given information type has to be specified only
once, at the relevant annotation level (e.g.
grammatical relations such as subject and object
are only specified at the functional level).
Finally, d) is guaranteed by the independence of
syntactic annotation levels: spoken data, which
are typically fraught with ellipses, anacolutha,
syntactic incompleteness and other related
disfluency phenomena cannot be easily
represented in terms of constituency. By
contrast, the level of functional analysis - which
in ISST has an independent status - naturally
reflects a somewhat standardised representation,
since it abstracts away from the surface
realisation of syntactic units in a sentence, thus
being relatively independent of disfluency
phenomena and incomplete phrases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999868">
3.2 Syntactic annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967142857143">
Most treebanks, currently available or under
construction for different languages, adopt a
unique syntactic representation layer, following
either a costituency-based approach (see, among
many others, Marcus et al. 1993, Sampson 1995,
Greenbaum 1996, Sandoval et al. 1999) or a
dependency-based one (e.g. Karlsson et al.
1995), or a hybrid one combining features of
both (e.g. Brants et al. 1999, Abeill6 et al. 2000).
ISST departs from all of them since it adopts a
multi-level structure.
To our knowledge, the only multi-level treebank
is the Prague Dependency Treebank (PTD,
B6mov‡ et al. 1999), but in this case the
different annotation levels refer respectively to
a) the surface dependency relations and b) the
underlying sentence structure. By contrast, ISST
adopts a monostratal view of syntax, and thus
both syntactic annotation levels are rather
intended to provide orthogonal views of the
same surface syntax. These views, though
complementary, are developed independently of
each other.
This bi-level approach to syntactic
representation is particularly suited to deal with
a language like Italian, which allows for
considerable variation in the ordering of
constituents at the sentence level. In fact, by
decoupling functional information from the
constituent structure, the treatment of word
order variation does not interfere in any way
with the representation of functional relations,
i.e. the encoding of the latter becomes entirely
separate from the order of contituents in the
sentence.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.921443">
3.2.1 Constituency annotation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9960020625">
In ISST, constituency annotation departs from
other constituency-based syntactic annotation
schemes (e.g. the one adopted in the Penn
Treebank) in a number of respects, due to: a) the
peculiarities of Italian as a free constituent order
language; b) the distributed organisation of
syntactic annotation in ISST.
Constituency annotation in ISST uses an
inventory of 22 constituent types (see table
below). Specialized constituent names are used
for a number of complements or adjuncts, in
order to help the mapping with functional
annotation.

From the point of view of their relations to
functional labelling, syntactic constituents are
divided up into two main subgroups (see column
3 of the table above): functional constituents and
substantial constituents. This subdivision
reflects theoretical assumptions which are
derived from the Lexical Functional Grammar
theory. In particular, functional constituents are
internally subdivided into structural constituents
(used to set complements apart) and lexical
constituents (headed by a lexical head with or
without semantic content). Structural
constituents also contain F and CP where F has
the task of indicating the canonical sentential
constituent and CP indicates the presence of
sentential adjuncts, or some discontinuity in the
utterance.
At the same time, the fact that in ISST functional
relations are dealt with at a distinct level instead
of being defined in terms of constituent
structures allows ISST to dispense with empty
elements such as null subjects or traces, thus
making annotation more intelligible. In fact, the
relevant information is recovered at the
functional level, through a relation linking the
displaced element to its head. Therefore,
syntactic phenomena such as pro-drop, ellipsis
as well as cases of discontinuous or non
canonical order of constituents (topicalisation,
wh-questions, etc.) are not accounted for in
terms of empty categories and coindexation as
e.g. in the Penn Treebank but rather at the
functional annotation level.
Constituency annotation of ISST is worked out in
a semi-automatic way. First, the text is parsed by
a Shallow Parser (Delmonte 1999, 2000) whose
task is that of building shallow syntactic
structures for each safely recognizable
constituent. In uncertainty cases, no attachment
is performed at this stage in order to avoid being
committed to structural decisions which might
then reveal themselves to be wrong. In fact, it is
preferable to perform some readjustment
operations after structures have been built rather
than introducing errors from the start. Then, the
output of the shallow parser is manually revised
and corrected.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.987796">
3.2.2 Functional annotation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862189189189">
Functional annotation in ISST is carried out by
marking relations between words belonging to
major lexical classes only (i.e. non-auxiliary
verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs),
independently of previous identification of
phrasal constituents. Advantages of this choice
include, on the theoretical front, the fact that
ISST can be used as a reference resource for a
wider variety of different annotation schemes,
both constituency- and dependency-based ones
(Lin 1998). Moreover, on the applicative side,
head-based functional annotation is
comparatively easy and &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; to be used for
parsing evaluation since it overcomes some of
the well-known shortcomings of constituency-
based evaluation (see, among others, Carroll et
al. 1998, Sampson 1998, Lin 1998). Last but not
least, head-based functional annotation is
naturally i) multi-lingual, as functional relations
probably represent the most significant level of
syntactic analysis at which cross-language
comparability makes sense, and ii) multi-modal,
since it permits comparable annotation of both
spoken and written language.
FAME (Lenci et al. 1999, 2000) is the
annotation scheme (originally developed in the
SPARKLE project LE-2111 and then revised in
the framework of ELSE LE4-8340) adopted for
functional annotation in ISST, which has been
revised and integrated to make it suitable for
annotation of unrestricted Italian texts. The
building blocks of FAME are functional
relations, further subdivided into dependency
relations and other relation types dealing with
coordination phenomena and clause-internal co-
referential bonds. Only the former are described
below for sake of paper length.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99586">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.977279581395349">
A dependency relation is an asymmetric binary
relation between full words, respectively a head
and a dependent. Each dependency relation is
expressed as follows:
dep_type (lex_head.&lt;head_features&gt;,
dependent.&lt;dep_features&gt;)
where dep_type specifies the relationship
holding between the lexical head and its
dependent. At this level, either the head or the
dependent can correspond to elliptical material;
this makes it possible to deal with pro-drop
phenomena and other types of elliptical
constructions.
Dep_types are hierarchically structured to make
provision for underspecified representations of
highly ambiguous functional analyses (see
above). The typology of dependency relations,
hierarchically organized, is given below.
In the proposed scheme a crucial role is played
by the features associated with the elements of
the relation, which complement relational
information. Features convey, for instance,
information about the grammatical word
(preposition or conjunction) which possibly
introduces the dependent in a given relation, or
about the open/closed predicative function of
clausal dependents (in this way control
information is also encoded).
Functional annotation in ISST is thus modularly
represented, i.e. it is structured into relational
and feature information, each factoring out
different but interrelated facets of functional
annotation. This modular representation
provides the prerequisites for ISST to be used as
a reference annotation scheme which is
compatible with a wide range of theories and
thus mappable onto different syntactic
representation formats (for more details on the
intertranslatability of FAME into other syntactic
representation formats see Lenci et al. 1999,
2000).
Annotation at the functional level is carried out
manually.

The sketchy description of the syntactic
annotation schemes provided above is
complemented here with annotation examples.
The two ISST syntactic annotation levels, the
constituent structure and the functional ones, are
developed independently; in spite of this fact,
they are strictly interrelated and complement
each other.
In order to show the peculiarities of the two
annotation levels and their interrelations, let us
consider the ISST annotation of the following
Italian sentence, Giovanni sembra arrivare

Note that the subject relation holding between
arrivare and Giovanni in the functional
annotation does not find an explicit counterpart
at the level of constituent structure
representation since subject raising is not treated
at that level.
Depending on the expected uses, the two
annotation layers can be accessed and examined
independently. However, due to the
complementarity of the information contained in
them, combined views on the developed
resource can also be obtained. For instance,
projection of functional information onto the
constituent structure results as follows:
f-[ sn-sogg[Giovanni],
ibar-[sembra],
sv2-arg[arrivare,
savv-mod[domani]]]
where each constituent category is marked,

3.3 Lexico-semantic annotation
3.3.1 Basics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999808071428571">
The strategy set-up for annotation at this level
takes advantage of two previous experiments of
semantic tagging carried out at ILC in the
framework of the SENSEVAL initiative (Calzolari
et al., forthcoming) and of the ELSNET resources
task group activity (Corazzari et al., 2000).
In ISST, lexico-semantic annotation consists in
the assignment of semantic tags, expressed in
terms of attribute/value pairs, to full words or
sequences of words corresponding to a single
unit of sense (e.g. compounds, idioms). In
particular, annotation is restricted to nouns,
verbs and adjectives and corresponding multi-
word expressions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.865014125">
ISST semantic tags convey three different types
of information:
1) sense of the target word(s) in the specific
context: ItalWordNet (henceforth, IWN) is
the reference lexical resource used for the
sense tagging task (CPR et al., 2000). IWN,
developed from the EuroWordNet lexicon
(Alonge et al. 1998), includes two parts, a
general one and a specialized one with
financial and computational terminology;
2) other types of lexico-semantic information
not included in the reference lexical resource,
e.g. for marking of figurative uses;
3) information about the tagging operation,
mainly notes by the human annotator about
problematic annotation cases.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992715">
Note that through the taxonomical organisation
of IWN word senses an implicit assignment is
made to the semantic types of the IWN
ontology. In this way, ISST sense tagging can
also be seen as semantic tagging.
Starting from the assumption that senses do not
always correspond to single lexical items, the
following typology of annotation units is
identified and distinguished in ISST:
us: sense units corresponding to single lexical
items (either nouns, verbs or adjectives);
usc: semantically complex units expressed in
terms of multi-word expressions (e.g.
compounds, support verb constructions,
idioms);
ust: title sense units corresponding to titles of
any type (of newspapers, books, shows, etc.).
Titles receive a two-level annotation: at the
level of individual components and as a
single title unit.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.681435">
3.3.2 Annotation criteria
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997285">
Each annotation unit is tagged with the relevant
sense according to IWN sense distinctions. In
order to meet requirement c) in section 3.1
above, arbitrary sense assignments, which may
occur when more than one IWN sense applies to
the context being tagged, are avoided by means
of underspecification (expressed in terms of
disjunction/conjunction over different IWN
senses).
The other lexico-semantic tags allow to mark:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996154653846154">
• a us or usc used in a metaphoric or
methonymic or more generally in a figurative
sense: e.g. la molla di una simile violenza
&apos;the spring of such a violence&apos; where molla is
used in a metaphoric sense. The distinction
between lexicalized and non lexicalized
figurative usages can be inferred from the
assigned IWN sense: non lexicalized
figurative uses are linked to the literal sense;
• a us semantically modified through
evaluative suffixation (e.g. appartamentino
&apos;small flat&apos;, concertone &apos;big concert&apos;);
• the semantic type (i.e. human entity, artifact,
institution, location, etc.) of proper nouns,
either us (e.g. pds &apos;the pds party&apos; is
semantically tagged as a &apos;group&apos;) or usc (e.g.
Corno d’Africa &apos;the Horn of Africa&apos; is
assigned the sematic type of &apos;place&apos;);
• the usc subtype, e.g. compound (e.g. prestito
obbligazionario &apos;loan stock&apos;), idiom (e.g.
mettere i puntini sulle i &apos;to dot one’s i’s&apos;),
support verb construction (e.g. dare aiuto &apos;to
give assistance&apos;);
• the ust subtype, i.e. title of an opera (e.g. Il
barbiere di Siviglia), of a newspaper (e.g. La
Nazione) or of something else.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999815">
In this way, the annotated corpus provides more
than a list of instantiations of the senses attested
in the reference lexical resource. Through the
added value of this additional information, the
annotated corpus becomes a repository of
interesting semantic information going from
titles and proper nouns to non-lexicalized
metaphors, metonymies and evaluative

<bodyText confidence="0.992957470588235">
suffixation, and in general to non-conventional
uses of a word.
Finally, notes about the tagging operation are
mainly used to ease and speed up the annotation
process and its revision: the human annotator
can keep track of problematic cases (e.g. cases
of indistinguishable IWN senses, of ambiguous
corpus contexts, etc.). Input of this type may
also be useful for discussion with the team of
IWN lexicographers with a view to prospective
revisions and updating of the lexical resource.
As to the annotation methodology for this level,
in order to ensure that polysemous words and
usc are tagged consistently, the annotation is
manually performed ‘per lemma’ and not
sequentially, that is, word by word following the
text.

3.3.3 Annotation examples
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999815">
Let us exemplify the annotation strategy
illustrated in the previous sections with a few
semantically tagged corpus occurrences.
An example of an annotated us is given below:
the target word is ferite &apos;wounds&apos; in the context
curare le ferite del mondo &apos;to cure the wounds of
the world&apos;. In the annotation window, the target
word is assigned the sense number 2; the feature
figurato=metaf marks its metaphoric use in the
specific corpus context.
Annotation of semantically complex units (usc)
is exemplified below for the multi-word
expression essere alle corde &apos;to be hard-pressed&apos;:
The blue box covering the text shows that it has
been marked as a usc; the annotation window
specifies its sense number (1) in IWN and its
type (idiom).
Finally, an example is given below for title
sense units, or ust. It can be noticed that the
book title Europa 1937 &apos;Europe 1937&apos; is
annotated both at the level of its constituting
words (see Europa) and as a single unit of type
title of a book (tipo=semiotico). Obviously,
sense information does not apply to ust.

4 The multi-level Linguistic Annotation
Tool
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999758">
The labour intensive annotation task demands
for tools devoted to access efficiently the large
amount of textual data and the related
annotations. In this perspective, both a data
model and effective graphical representations
are mandatory.
GesTALt is the annotation tool defined for ISST
where an object oriented data definition has
been preferred for its flexibility. Specific data
models and graphical representations are defined
so to comply with the different needs of the
three levels of annotation. Building upon these
data models, level-oriented subsystems are
settled. The tool is also designed to ease the
control of intra-level and inter-levels coherence.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999672">
4.1 The linguistic data base
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866125">
The model of linguistic data is designed within
the object oriented formalism. The defined data
are directly used in the object oriented database
underlying GesTALt. For each level of
annotation, a specific container has to be
defined. The system (and its subsystems)
manages a collection of documents, the corpus:
this relation is represented in a class hierarchy.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997005">
24
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999538615384616">
Moreover, the different level interpretations
associated with sentences in the corpus are
modeled respectively via the class of objects. To
give the flavor of the object modeling of
linguistic structures, we present here the
hierarchy describing constituent annotation (i.e.
the class synt_int).
Constituency annotation is based on tree
structures where both internal nodes and leaves
are constituents (const). Leaves are called basic
constituents (b_const), while internal nodes
complex constituents (c_const). The resultant
synt_int sub-hierarchy is depicted in Fig. 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.999678142857143">
Complex constituents are collections of
constituents, either basic or complex ones. A
constituency-based syntactic interpretation is
thus the complex constituent representing the
interpretation of the whole sentence. This notion
is modeled by the relation between the c_const
class and the synt_int class in the hierarchy.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977352">
4.2 The visual representation of
annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999477666666666">
Managing large sentence annotations is
cumbersome. Effective graphical representations
are needed both for the annotator and the user.
Their aim is to ease the navigation in intricate
information.
Constituency-based annotation schemes are tree
structures. Graphical tree representations aim to
ease the user interactions with the tree
structures, i.e. the display, retrieval and updating
of annotation.
The visual representation defined is a strip tree
(see Fig. 2) which resembles standard bracketed
representations and provides an intuitive and
easy to modify hierarchical view of the
constituent structure.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.847213">
Fig. 2 Strip tree
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9920082">
Functional annotation is visually represented in
terms of graphs, where functional relations are
drawn as arcs linking the head and the
dependent. The insertion/deletion of elliptical
material is another essential feature of this tool
module.
Finally, lexico-semantic annotation, which
proceeds per lemma, does not pose specific
representation requirements, while browsing at
this level needs the parallel use of the IWN tool.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998184">
4.3 GesTALt architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928235294118">
The GesTALt annotation workbench is the
resultant system, constituted by a pool of
cooperative subsystems. The system manages
the linguistic database sketched in section 4.1
and allows its output in the XML standard.
The system is a suite composed by specific
applications: SinTAS for constituent annotation;
FunTAS for functional annotation; SemTAS for
lexico-semantic annotation; and ValTAS for
evaluation and correction of inter- and intra-
level annotations.
FunTAS, SinTAS, and SemTAS are stand alone
applications. The synthesis of the three
subsystems is obtained in ValTAS that need all
the capabilities spread in the subsystems. The
technologies adopted for the development
(object-oriented design), in conjunction with an
ad-hoc architectural design, allows an easy reuse
of the functionalities developed for the
subsystems in the global (i.e. ValTAS) system.
The overall GesTALt architecture is shown in
Fig. 3 (overleaf), where components are
represented as boxes, and interactions as arrows.
The creating/translating flow of the object-
oriented database (GestTALt–OODB) is shared
by the subsystems. Information is extracted from
and injected in XML containers via specific
wrappers (Wrapper-in and Wrapper-out) . The
GestTALt–OODB is the object oriented database
where the annotation of the different levels is
stored respectively by FunTAS, SinTAS and
SemTAS, together with the morphologically
annotated corpus used as input by all annotation
modules.

5 Treebank Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968214285714">
The information stored in ISST, in particular in
the financial corpus, will be used to improve an
automatic Italian-English translation system,
PeTra Word 2.0 , developed by Synthema and
already on the market.
PeTra is based on the Logical Grammars (&amp;quot;Slot
Grammars&amp;quot;) formalism (McCord 1980, 1989)
and is composed of three main components: the
Italian language analyser (morphologic analyser,
monolingual dictionary and syntactic parser), the
transfer component (bilingual dictionary and
structural transfer rules) and the English
morphologic generator. We expect to improve:
dictionaries, Italian grammar and transfer rules.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.912555">
5.1 Changes to the dictionary content
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970117647059">
Adding the missing entries: PeTra&apos;s dictionary
coverage will be enlarged through addition of
missing specialised entries and through
improvement of already contained entries.
Associated translations will be added to the
bilingual dictionary.
Inserting new multi-word expressions: the multi-
word expressions annotated in ISST will be
revised and added to the dictionary either in
terms of single entries or of particular
constructions associated with component
words, considering the system constrains.
Improving lexico-semantic hierarchy: by using
lexico-semantic annotation, the semantic-
hierarchical dictionary structure will be
revised: the semantic attributes are especially
used for the lexical transfer disambiguation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999182">
5.2 Analysis Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998391304348">
The current grammar has a good coverage (i.e.
88% on unrestricted texts), but it is likely that
many structures in the ISST corpus will be
analysed incompletely or incorrectly: the corpus
is a specialised one and it may contain
constructions which are not used in standard
Italian. ISST will be examined to check the
grammar coverage: accessing ISST on the basis
of functional relations, which correspond to the
slots, will allow to study the features and the
Constituents, in order to determine the possible
structures and encode the proper rules.
The translation tests will also allow to determine
the sentences which are not recognised by the
current grammar: the rules will be modified by
retrieving the “similar” structures contained into
ISST. The access to ISST will be made through
the sentence being examined in order to obtain
the two syntactic annotations, study them to
determine the uncovered structure and other
possible annotations of the same type inside the
corpus, and finally analyse them to decide
whether and how to apply possible changes.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988944">
5.3 Transfer Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967">
By analysing all of the new elements included
into the analysis rules and revising the
translation tests, the set of rules which forms the
syntactic transfer can be improved.

5.4 Results Evaluation

the translations of texts in the ISST financial
corpus. These translations will be obtained
before and after the system tuning. The
evaluation will verify the improvement obtained.

ISST departs from all of them since it adopts a multi-level structure. To our knowledge, the only multi-level treebank is the Prague Dependency Treebank (PTD, B6mov‡ et al. 1999), but in this case the different annotation levels refer respectively to a) the surface dependency relations and b) the underlying sentence structure. By contrast, ISST adopts a monostratal view of syntax, and thus both syntactic annotation levels are rather intended to provide orthogonal views of the same surface syntax. These views, though complementary, are developed independently of each oth</context>

Advantages of this choice include, on the theoretical front, the fact that ISST can be used as a reference resource for a wider variety of different annotation schemes, both constituency- and dependency-based ones (Lin 1998). Moreover, on the applicative side, head-based functional annotation is comparatively easy and &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; to be used for parsing evaluation since it overcomes some of the well-known shortcomings of constituencybased evaluation (see, among others, Carroll et al. 1998, Sampson 1998, Lin 1998). Last but not least, head-based functional annotation is naturally i) multi-lingual, as functional relations probably represent the most significant level of syntactic analysis at which cross-language comparability makes sense, and ii) multi-modal, since it permits comparable annotation of both spoken and written language. FAME (Lenci et al. 1999, 2000) is the annotation scheme (originally developed in the SPARKLE project LE-2111 and then revised in the framework of ELSE LE4-8340) adopted for functional annotation in ISST, which has been revised and integrated to make</context>

In ISST, lexico-semantic annotation consists in the assignment of semantic tags, expressed in terms of attribute/value pairs, to full words or sequences of words corresponding to a single unit of sense (e.g. compounds, idioms). In particular, annotation is restricted to nouns, verbs and adjectives and corresponding multiword expressions. ISST semantic tags convey three different types of information: 1) sense of the target word(s) in the specific context: ItalWordNet (henceforth, IWN) is the reference lexical resource used for the sense tagging task (CPR et al., 2000). IWN, developed from th</context>

In fact, the relevant information is recovered at the functional level, through a relation linking the displaced element to its head. Therefore, syntactic phenomena such as pro-drop, ellipsis as well as cases of discontinuous or non canonical order of constituents (topicalisation, wh-questions, etc.) are not accounted for in terms of empty categories and coindexation as e.g. in the Penn Treebank but rather at the functional annotation level. Constituency annotation of ISST is worked out in a semi-automatic way. First, the text is parsed by a Shallow Parser (Delmonte 1999, 2000) whose task is that of building shallow syntactic structures for each safely recognizable constituent. In uncertainty cases, no attachment is performed at this stage in order to avoid being committed to structural decisions which might then reveal themselves to be wrong. In fact, it is preferable to perform some readjustment operations after structures have been built rather than introducing errors from the start. Then, the output of the shallow parser is manually revised and corrected. 3.2.2 Functional annotation Functional annotation in ISST is carried out by marking relations between</context>

Last but not least, head-based functional annotation is naturally i) multi-lingual, as functional relations probably represent the most significant level of syntactic analysis at which cross-language comparability makes sense, and ii) multi-modal, since it permits comparable annotation of both spoken and written language. FAME (Lenci et al. 1999, 2000) is the annotation scheme (originally developed in the SPARKLE project LE-2111 and then revised in the framework of ELSE LE4-8340) adopted for functional annotation in ISST, which has been revised and integrated to make it suitable for annotation of unrestricted Italian texts. The building blocks of FAME are functional relations, further subdivided into dependency relations and other relation types dealing with coordination phenomena and clause-internal coreferential bonds. Only the former are described below for sake of paper length. 21 A dependency relation is an asymmetric binary rel</context>

Functional annotation in ISST is thus modularly represented, i.e. it is structured into relational and feature information, each factoring out different but interrelated facets of functional annotation. This modular representation provides the prerequisites for ISST to be used as a reference annotation scheme which is compatible with a wide range of theories and thus mappable onto different syntactic representation formats (for more details on the intertranslatability of FAME into other syntactic representation formats see Lenci et al. 1999, 2000). Annotation at the functional level is carried out manually. 3.2.3 Annotation examples The sketchy description of the syntactic annotation schemes provided above is complemented here with annotation examples. The two ISST syntactic annotation levels, the constituent structure and the functional ones, are developed independently; in spite of this fact, they are strictly interrelated and complement each other. In order to show the peculiarities of the two annotation levels and their interrelations, let us consider the ISST annotation of the following Italian sentence, Giovanni sembra arr</context>

Advantages of this choice include, on the theoretical front, the fact that ISST can be used as a reference resource for a wider variety of different annotation schemes, both constituency- and dependency-based ones (Lin 1998). Moreover, on the applicative side, head-based functional annotation is comparatively easy and &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; to be used for parsing evaluation since it overcomes some of the well-known shortcomings of constituencybased evaluation (see, among others, Carroll et al. 1998, Sampson 1998, Lin 1998).

PeTra is based on the Logical Grammars (&amp;quot;Slot Grammars&amp;quot;) formalism (McCord 1980, 1989) and is composed of three main components: the Italian language analyser (morphologic analyser, monolingual dictionary and syntactic parser), the transfer component (bilingual dictionary and structural transfer rules) and the English morphologic generator. We expect to improve: dictionaries, Italian grammar and transfer rules. 5.1 Changes to the dictionary content Adding the missing entries: PeTra&apos;s dictionary coverage will be enlarged through addition of missing specialised entries and through improvement of already contained entries.
