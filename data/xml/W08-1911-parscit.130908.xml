Rephrasing text spans is a common task
when revising a text. However, traditional
dictionaries often cannot provide direct as-
sistance to writers in performing this task.
In this article, we describe an approach
to obtain a monolingual phrase lexicon
using techniques used in Statistical Ma-
chine Translation. A part to be rephrased
is first translated into a pivot language,
and then translated back into the origi-
nal language. Models for assessing flu-
ency, meaning preservation and lexical di-
vergence are used to rank possible rephras-
ings, and their relative weight can be tuned
by the user so as to better address her
needs. An evaluation shows that these
models can be used successfully to select
rephrasings that are likely to be useful to a
writer.

Once an initial draft of a text is ready, writers face
the difficult phase of text revision. Changes may
be made for various reasons: correcting spelling or
grammatical errors, making the text locally more
fluent (for example, in case it contains wordings
that are literal translations from another language),
avoiding close repetitions or enforcing terminolog-
ical consistency, or better conveying the writer’s
ideas. All these changes can affect text spans of
various sizes, and can globally be seen as cases
of rephrasing. Paraphrasing involves rephrasings

that are semantically equivalent, but targets termi-
nology and style that are more suited to the con-
text of use of a text. In a broad sense, rephrasing
may involve wordings that convey different mean-
ings in an attempt to correct or make the writer’s
thoughts more precise. Research concerned with
the study of changes between writers’ drafts (tex-
tual genetic criticism) can help in understanding
writers’ rewriting processes, and can be supported
by automatic tools (e.g. (Bourdaillet et al., 2007)).
In this work, we address the issue of how writ-
ers can be assisted in finding wordings that corre-
spond to multi-word phrases of any nature. Given
an original text span, the writer is presented with
a list of rephrasings that are organized by taking
into account the context of the rephrasing and user-
specified preferences. Our proposal can therefore
be used as a lexicon operating at the phrasal level,
which can be used either when writers are faced
with a tip-of-the-tongue lexical access problem, or
when they are not completely satisfied with some
initial wording. In the former case, they may be
able to come up with some words or phrases that
would be different in meaning from what they are
looking for, and in the latter they may be looking
for a near-synonymous wording that is more ap-
propriate to a given context, for example to avoid
close repetitions. To define such a phrase lexi-
con and its possible mode of use, the following
questions should be considered: (a) how the lex-
icon entries are obtained, (b) what can be the entry
points and how can one navigate in the results, and
(c) how the results are displayed.
Rephrasing can be more or less complex and
problematic depending on the consequences at the
various levels:

• An entire expression or sentence is replaced

generally to obtain a good fit with regard to
the surrounding text, the replacing unit being
well-formed by definition.
• The replacing element may require syntactic
changes of the matrix, i.e. the text in which it
is embedded. This occurs if the source word
and the target word have different syntactic
requirements, and this can be seen as a good
reason to replace entire sentences, or at least
sentence fragments. This assumes a pattern
dictionary, where patterns achieving the same
conceptual goal are grouped together.

In the next section, we discuss limitations of tra-
ditional dictionaries with respect to the targeted
task, and describe an approach to obtain phrase
rephrasings through a pivot translation into another
language. In section 3, we discuss the issue of the
organization of the results along various axis: flu-
ency of rephrasings, preservation of meaning, and
lexical divergence between original text spans and
rephrasings. We then present an initial evaluation
of our approach on French rephrasing in section 4.
Related work is presented in section 5, and we fi-
nally discuss our approach and our future work in

2 Lexicon of phrase rephrasings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915676470588">
Dictionaries and semantic resources such as the-
sauri can be used to find words by following links
of different kinds from a given entry point. Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998) is one such resource. For a
proposal of other kinds of links and navigational
aids see also (Zock and Bilac, 2004; Zock, 2006;
Zock, 2007).
Words are the traditional units that people ex-
pect to find in dictionaries. Whereas some types
of dictionaries can contain multiword expressions,
such as compound nouns and terms, those corre-
spond to linguistically-motivated units. In order
to rephrase phrases of any type with a dictionary, a
writer may have to look up several words, combine
various information and validate the result using
her experience of the language or throught the use
of a concordancer. Moreover, dictionary lookups
are in most cases insensitive to the actual context
of words in an existing text. It is therefore the re-
sponsibility of its users to ensure that a choice is
appropriate for a given context, which can be quite
difficult, for example when writing in a second lan-
guage.
One way of obtaining phrase rephrasings is by
looking at phrases that occur in similar contexts
in a monolingual corpus (e.g. (Munteanu and
Marcu, 2006)). In order to extract a comprehensive
phrase lexicon, a very large number of sentences
should be compared to extract potential rephras-
ings, which furthermore may often correspond to
phrases that are too remotely connected. Parallel
corpora provide the interesting advantage that it is
reasonable to assume that elements from one side
of the corpus should be aligned to elements on the
other side, and that associations of elements can be
reinforced by the number of times they occur in the
corpus. Various approaches for word alignment
from parallel corpora have been proposed (see e.g.
(Och and Ney, 2003)), and the phrase-based ap-
proach to Statistical Machine Translation (Koehn
et al., 2003) has led to the development of heuris-
tics for obtaining alignments between phrases of
any number of words.
Unfortunately, monolingual parallel corpora
aligned at the sentence level, such as various trans-
lations of a novel in a foreign language, are re-
sources that are extremely scarce. Using bilingual
parallel corpora, a much more common resource,
one can obtain various possible phrase translations
for a given source phrase, as well as some estimate
of the distribution of probabilities for the various
translations of that phrase. Such N —* M aligne-
ments can capture lexical translations (e.g. exi-
geons —* ask for, call for, demand, expect, request,
etc.) and phrasal literal or idiomatic translations
(e.g. un bon d´ebut —* a good approach, a good
first move, a good starting point, a positive initia-
tive, an encouraging start, the right road, etc.), but
can also capture noise depending on the alignment
heuristics used (e.g. les ´etats candidats (candi-
date countries) —* Member States, the candidate
countries were to, the accession countries have
called for, candidate, the, etc.) Different target
phrases associated with a given source phrase can
either represent paraphrases or phrases with differ-
ent meanings. Among the limitations of this type
of phrasal alignments are their inability to model
non-consecutive words and to generalize the con-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99967692">
tents of phrases, and the fact that their translations
are not conditioned on their context.
If phrase extraction is performed in two oppo-
site directions, then it is possible to find the pos-
sible translations of a given phrase (and their con-
ditional probabilities), and then to translate back
those phrases into the original language. In this ap-
proach proposed by (Bannard and Callison-Burch,
2005), the second language acts as a pivot, as il-
lustrated on figure 1. Because of the nature of the
possible alignments, this pivot can represent vari-
ous senses, which in context can be equivalent or
comparable to that of the original phrase. In turn,
the same phenomena can take place when translat-
ing back from the pivot phrases to the original lan-
guage, and the resulting rephrasings can be equiv-
alent or comparable in meaning to that of the orig-
inal phrase in some context, may also be incom-
plete and/or require other changes in the rephrased
sentence.
Bannard and Callison-Burch have defined a
paraphrase probability between two phrases p1
and p2 (with p1 =6 p2) that uses conditional proba-
bilities between phrases and sums over all possible
pivot phrases:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.985206">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996146238095238">
(Callison-Burch, 2007) measured the impor-
tance of various factors impacting the quality of
the paraphrases obtained. Using manually built
alignments yields a significant improvement in
paraphrase quality, showing that if better align-
ments are available the proposed approach can
produce better paraphrases. Alignments between
several languages can be used for finding pivot
phrases, and using several simulateously tend to
improve alignment quality and therefore para-
phrases themselves. Using a language model to
find paraphrases that maximize its score in the
original sentencial context leads to improved flu-
ency, but has a negative impact on meaning preser-
vation. Lastly, restricting pivot phrases to those
actually aligned in a test aligned bilingual corpus
improves paraphrase quality, which illustrates the
importance of disambiguating source phrases rela-
tively to the pivot language.
The rephrasings obtained can be classified into
several categories when used in context:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988156172413793">
• A rephrasing can be a paraphrase that is valid
in all contexts (e.g. je vous donne raison →
je suis d’accord avec vous), in specific gram-
matical contexts (e.g. pouvoir accueillir dans
de bonnes conditions les pays → comme il se
doit) and/or pragmatic contexts (e.g. c’est un
bon d´ebut → nous partons du bon pied).
• A rephrasing can contain shifts in meaning
with the original phrase which might be ac-
ceptable or not (e.g. nous voulons apporter
notre contribution a` ce d´ebat → donner de
la valeur). Some such rephrasings reveal a
natural bias towards the bilingual corpus used
(e.g. le prochain ´elargissement constitue la
principale tˆache → l’ objectifprincipal).
• A rephrasing can be ill-formed but still con-
tain elements of interest to a writer (e.g. ceux
qui disent que ... se trompent → devrions
a` nouveau r´el´echir; here a rephrasing such
as devraient a` nouveau r´el´echir could be
deemed acceptable in some contexts).
• A rephrasing may introduce a contradiction
in a specific context (e.g. ce n’est pas le mo-
ment de se montrer h´esitant → il est trop tˆot
pour)
• A rephrasing may be inexploitable because it
is syntactically ill-formed in context and does
not contain any element of interest, or is too
close to the original phrase.

<bodyText confidence="0.999448857142857">
The most natural entry point to such a resource
is by entering a phrase or selecting it in a text under
revision. Approximate search can also be of use,
as done in some concordancer software, for exam-
ple by allowing the user to enter word-based reg-
ular expressions mixing literal words, word lem-
mas, word part-of-speech or even word classes
(e.g. types of named entities). Boolean queries
on indexes of word lemmas can also be used to of-
fer yet more flexibility to search the lexicon, but at
the cost of more candidate results. Once results are
returned, they can recursively be reused as source
phrases, so as to offer a means to navigate by iter-
ative refining.

to discard some of them. The proposed ranking
should reflect as best as possible the preferences of
the user for the task at hand in order to minimize
reading time and maintain the user’s interest in us-
ing the phrase lexicon. It is essential to give the
user some control over how the results are returned
depending on what is more important to her. For
example, (Ferret and Zock, 2006) have proposed
to present results from a dictionary enriched with
topical associations in chunks to allow for catego-
rial search. There will be cases where the user may
find acceptable only grammatical results, while in
other cases the user might accept agrammatical re-
sults provided they contain interesting suggestions.
Moreover, it seems extremely important that result
ranking can take into account the phrase substitu-
tion into the original context.
Considering how the proposed phrase lexicon is
built, the pivot paraphrasing probability of equa-
tion 1 (PIV) can be used as a baseline ordering.
Such a model reflects some strength of association
between a rephrased phrase and the original phrase
using the extracted phrases and conditional prob-
abilities derived from a bilingual training corpus.
It is therefore expected that results will be biased
towards that corpus if the latter belongs to a partic-
ular genre or theme. Nonetheless, one can expect
that some associations will be general enough to
be of general interest.
In addition, several models that users can in-
terpret as ranking criterion can be used simulate-
neously using the log-linear framework tradition-
ally used in SMT systems. However, contrary to
what is done in SMT, the weight of the models
cannot be automatically optimized if we do not use
an automatic evaluation of rephrasing quality, the
definition of which depending heavily on the sub-
jective appreciation of a user. Equation 2 shows
how the score of a rephrasing p2 of p1 can be com-
puted, where M is the set of models used, hm is
the logarithm of the normalized score of a model
and am its weight (with &amp;m∈M am = 1), and C
is the original sentence and the placeholder for the
rephrased phrase.

3.1 Control over fluency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973714285714">
As noted by (Mutton et al., 2007), the notion of
sentence-level fluency is not uniformely agreed
upon, and its evaluation by human judges is some-
times found subjective, but in practice judges can
obtain high levels of agreement about what can
be considered fluent or not. Like (Callison-Burch,
2007), we can use a language model (LM) to as-
sess the local fluency of a sentence after a phrase
has been substituted with a rephrasing. A degra-
dation in score (with a fluent original sentence)
can indicate that the rephrasing segment should be
adapted to the sentence, and/or that the sentence
itself should be modified in order to integrate the
new phrase as is.
Syntax parsers can produce various information
that can be relevant for assessing the fluency of
sentences, which can be used as features from dif-
ferent parsers for classification that can correlate
well with human judgment (Mutton et al., 2007).
When substituting a part of a sentence with an-
other phrase and if this substitution does not re-
quire other changes in the sentence, then at least
the dependency relationships between words out-
side that phrase should be preserved. This seems
coherent with our objective of focussing on the
task of phrase rephrasing when it is possible to
modify only a given phrase and obtain an accept-
able result.

3.2 Control over meaning preservation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978487179487">
The preservation of dependency relationships out-
side of the rephrased phrase can also play a role
in terms of meaning preservation. Dependency
relationships connecting words in the phrase and
words outside the phrase (i.e., whose governor is
outside the phrase and dependant inside it, or the
opposite) should still exist after such a substitution,
but possibly with a modified dependency target in
the phrase. Indeed, those relationships denote the
grammatical role of the words of the phrase rela-
tive to their context, and if those are preserved then
it is more likely that meaning is preserved.
We use a model based on dependency preser-
vation (DEP) which involves relationships outside
the rephrased phrase and relationships crossing
a boundary of that phrase. The score is based
on some proportion of the number of such de-
pendencies found after substitution over the num-
ber of original dependencies (see (Max, 2008) for
details). Another way of controlling for mean-
ing preservation is to ensure that only the pivot
phrases with the same meaning as the original
phrase are kept (and then their back translations).
(Callison-Burch, 2007) has shown the positive im-
pact on paraphrase quality of using a controlled
pivot present in an aligned sentence in a test bilin-
gual corpora. Phrase disambiguation techniques
have been proposed for SMT and could be applied
to the problem at hand (e.g. (Stroppa et al., 2007)).
In an interactive context, it makes sense to let the
user the opportunity to control for phrase sense by
rejecting bad pivot phrases if she wants to, which
is then similar to Callison-Burch’s experiment set-
tings. This manual selection must of course be op-
tional, but can be used when a user prefers a stricter
control on meaning. Another possibly interesting
use is to disambiguate in a pivot language corre-
sponding to one’s native language when writing in
a foreign language.

There will be cases when possible rephrasings will
be very close to their original phrase, differing
for example by only punctuation marks or verbal

ferent words. To account for differents words be-

4 Experiments and evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994678571428">
We carried out an evaluation on the local rephras-
ing of French sentences, using English as the
pivot language.2 We extracted phrase align-
ments of up to 7 word forms using the Giza++
alignment tool (Och and Ney, 2003) and the
grow-diag-final-and heuristics described
in (Koehn et al., 2003) on 948,507 sentences
of the French-English part of the Europarl cor-
pus (Koehn, 2005) and obtained some 42 million
phrase pairs for which probabilities were estimated
using maximum likelihood estimation. Statistics
for the extracted lexicons are reported on figure 2.
Entries of the monolingual phrase lexicon are built
dynamically from the entries of the monolingual
lexicons.
For the LM model, we used a 5-gram language
model trained on the French part of the corpus us-
ing Kneser-Ney smoothing. The robust parser for
French SYNTEX (Bourigault et al., 2005) was used
to obtain lemmas for word and labeled dependency
relationships between words, used respectively for
the LEM and DEP models. Robust parsers provide
the advantage that they can provide partial analysis
for correct chunks in agrammatical sentences, but
they can also recover information from agrammat-
ical chunks which can be undesirable in this case.3

2The main motivation for this choice was that we could
easily have access to French native speakers for manual eval-

glish, as well as experiments using another highly inflected
language as pivot such as Spanish.
3We intend to use several parsers for English implement-
ing different approaches as in (Mutton et al., 2007), but we
had access to only one parser for French.

language model was built. A human judge selected
one phrase of length 3 words or more per sen-
tence that would be a good candidate for rephras-
ing, and which was accepted if it belonged to the
French-English lexicon4. We kept at most the 20
first rephrasings obtained using the baseline PIV
model, and asked two French native speakers to
evaluate on a 5-level scale each the 1648 refor-
mulated sentences obtained on fluency, meaning
preservation, and authoring value, where the lat-
ter was described in the following way: (5) the
rephrasing can be directly reused for revising a
text, (4) the rephrasing can be used with a mi-
nor change, (3) the rephrasing contains elements
that could be used for a good rephrasing, (2) the
rephrasing contains elements that could suggest a
rephrasing, and (1) the rephrasing is useless.
After the judges had completed manual annota-
tion, smoothing of the scores was done by keep-
ing mean scores for each sentence. We measured
a value of 0.59 standard deviation for score differ-
ences between judges for grammaticality, 0.7 for
meaning preservation and 0.8 for authoring value.
Those values can indicate a growing difficulty in
judging those characteristics, and in particular that
judging authoring value on the proposed scale is
more dependant on personal judgment. Results of
mean scores for the first rank solutions with vari-
ous model combinations with uniform weights are
reported on figure 3, and results for mean author-
ing value scores depending on the number of top
results presented to the user are reported on fig-
ure 4.
Authoring value scores are lower, which can be
explained by the fact that rephrasings with bad
fluency and/or meaning preservation scores will
penalize authoring value scores according to our
scale. The best results are obtained when combin-
ing all models, which remains true when consider-
ing mean results up to at least 8 rephrasings.
The baseline PIV model seems to have the most
impact, but all other models also contribute in
different ways. This suggests that which model
should be used (or its weight in our framework)
could be chosen by a user. In the following ex-
ample, the LEM model helped select a rephrasing
which obtained good scores:

miner. The actual meaning of words depends on
the context in which they are used. The work done
by the team of Gross on lexicon-grammar (e.g.
(Gross, 1984)) showed that a relatively small set of
clause patterns and syntactic constraints suffices to
cover most of common French.
Comparable monolingual corpora have been
used for automatic paraphrasing. Barzilay and
Lee (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) learned paraphras-

then used to produce sentence level paraphrases.
Their corpus contained news agency articles on the
same events, which allows precise sentence para-
phrasing, but on a small sets of phenomena and
for a limited domain. As sentential paraphras-
ing is more likely to alter meaning, Quirk et al.
(Quirk et al., 2004) approached paraphrasing as
a monotonous decoding by a phrase-based SMT
system. Their corpus consisted of monolingual
sentences extracted from a comparable corpus that
were automatically aligned so as to allow aligned
phrase extraction. Pang et al. (Pang et al., 2003)
used parallel monolingual corpora built from news
stories that had been independantly translated sev-
eral times to learn lattices from a syntax-based
alignment process.
Bannard and Callison-Burch (Bannard and
Callison-Burch, 2005) proposed to use pivot trans-
lation for paraphrasing phrases. Fujita (Fujita,
2005) proposed a transfer-and-revision framework
using linguistic knowledge for generating para-
phrases in Japanese and a model for error detec-
tion. At the lexical level, a recent evaluation on En-
glish lexical substitution was held (McCarthy and
Navigli, 2007) in which systems had to find lexical
synonyms and disambiguate the context.

In this article, we have presented an approach for
obtaining rephrasings for short text spans from par-
allel bilingual corpora. These rephrasings can be
ranked according to user-defined preferences, and
the weights of the models used can be dynamically
adjusted by a user depending on what features are
more important to her, for instance after an initial
list of candidates has been proposed by the sys-
tem. Indeed, good candidates include paraphrases,
but also more generally phrases that could help a
writer revise a text with some shifts in meaning,
even if at the cost of some corrections to make the
resulting text grammatical. Furthermore, search
for rephrasings can be iteratively performed using
candidate rephrasings as source phrases, and the
user can have some fine-grained control if select-
ing or rejecting possible pivot phrases manually.
Possible user interfaces to this proposed bilingual
phrase lexicon could include rephrasing memory
features to learn from interaction with the user, and
concordancing features to display the context of
use in the bilingual corpus of the segments used to
build the relevant lexicon entries. In the latter case,
the similarity used to select examples could take
the context of the phrases into account in terms of
dependency relationships.
There are several open issues to the presented
work. Important issues are where the phrases
can come from and the bias introduced by the re-
source used. Using a bilingual corpora such as
the Europarl corpus with this pivot approach yields
both generic and domain/genre-specific rephras-
ings, and it is important to be able to determine
their appropriate context of use. It would also
be interesting to investigate enriching this frame-
work with phrases learnt from monolingual cor-
pora from a given domain or genre, and to use fea-
tures from the current text under revision. More
generally, we would need to get some idea of the
degree of possible reuse of a given rephrasing.
Another important group of issues concerns lim-
itations due to the nature of phrases for the task
at hand. As we have said, phrases as units of
rephrasing are limited because they cannot model
non-consecutive words and because of the rigidity
of their content. Various types of entry points to
the rephrasing lexicon such as using word-based
regular expressions can in some way alleviate this
problem, but work could be done on the lexicon
itself. As shown by Callison-Burch (Callison-
Burch, 2007), much can be gained by using bet-
ter alignments. Alignments techniques using syn-
tactic information could eliminate weak rephras-
ing candidates (i.e. increase in overall precision),
but interesting phrasal alignments could be lost as
well (decrease in overall recall). Furthermore, in-
formation from the context of alignments could
also be used to disambiguate the source phrase and
get only pivot phrases that are compatible with the
context of a given rephrasing, in similar ways as
recently done for SMT (Stroppa et al., 2007).

<abstract confidence="0.99778205">Rephrasing text spans is a common task when revising a text. However, traditional dictionaries often cannot provide direct assistance to writers in performing this task. In this article, we describe an approach to obtain a monolingual phrase lexicon using techniques used in Statistical Machine Translation. A part to be rephrased is first translated into a pivot language, and then translated back into the original language. Models for assessing fluency, meaning preservation and lexical divergence are used to rank possible rephrasings, and their relative weight can be tuned by the user so as to better address her needs. An evaluation shows that these models can be used successfully to select rephrasings that are likely to be useful to a writer.</abstract>

Among the limitations of this type of phrasal alignments are their inability to model non-consecutive words and to generalize the con78 tents of phrases, and the fact that their translations are not conditioned on their context. If phrase extraction is performed in two opposite directions, then it is possible to find the possible translations of a given phrase (and their conditional probabilities), and then to translate back those phrases into the original language. In this approach proposed by (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), the second language acts as a pivot, as illustrated on figure 1. Because of the nature of the possible alignments, this pivot can represent various senses, which in context can be equivalent or comparable to that of the original phrase. In turn, the same phenomena can take place when translating back from the pivot phrases to the original language, and the resulting rephrasings can be equivalent or comparable in meaning to that of the original phrase in some context, may also be incomplete and/or require other changes in the rephrased sentence.

In a broad sense, rephrasing may involve wordings that convey different meanings in an attempt to correct or make the writer’s thoughts more precise. Research concerned with the study of changes between writers’ drafts (textual genetic criticism) can help in understanding writers’ rewriting processes, and can be supported by automatic tools (e.g. (Bourdaillet et al., 2007)). In this work, we address the issue of how writers can be assisted in finding wordings that correspond to multi-word phrases of any nature. Given an original text span, the writer is presented with a list of rephrasings that are organized by taking into account the context of the rephrasing and userspecified preferences. Our proposal can therefore be used as a lexicon operating at the phrasal level, which can be used either when writers are faced with a tip-of-the-tongue lexical access problem, or when they are not completely satisfied with some initial wording. In the former case, they may </context>

In turn, the same phenomena can take place when translating back from the pivot phrases to the original language, and the resulting rephrasings can be equivalent or comparable in meaning to that of the original phrase in some context, may also be incomplete and/or require other changes in the rephrased sentence. Bannard and Callison-Burch have defined a paraphrase probability between two phrases p1 and p2 (with p1 =6 p2) that uses conditional probabilities between phrases and sums over all possible pivot phrases: 1: P(p2|p1) = arg max P(pivot|p1)P(p2|pivot) p27�p1 pivot (1) (Callison-Burch, 2007) measured the importance of various factors impacting the quality of the paraphrases obtained. Using manually built alignments yields a significant improvement in paraphrase quality, showing that if better alignments are available the proposed approach can produce better paraphrases. Alignments between several languages can be used for finding pivot phrases, and using several simulateously tend to improve alignment quality and therefore paraphrases themselves.

Like (Callison-Burch, 2007), we can use a language model (LM) to assess the local fluency of a sentence after a phrase has been substituted with a rephrasing. A degradation in score (with a fluent original sentence) can indicate that the rephrasing segment should be adapted to the sentence, and/or that the sentence itself should be modified in order to integrate the new phrase as is. Syntax parsers can produce various information that can be relevant for assessing the fluency of sentences, which can be used as features from different parsers for classification that can correlate well with human judgment (Mutton et al., </context>

We use a model based on dependency preservation (DEP) which involves relationships outside the rephrased phrase and relationships crossing a boundary of that phrase. The score is based on some proportion of the number of such dependencies found after substitution over the number of original dependencies (see (Max, 2008) for details). Another way of controlling for meaning preservation is to ensure that only the pivot phrases with the same meaning as the original phrase are kept (and then their back translations). (Callison-Burch, 2007) has shown the positive impact on paraphrase quality of using a controlled pivot present in an aligned sentence in a test bilingual corpora. Phrase disambiguation techniques have been proposed for SMT and could be applied to the problem at hand (e.g. (Stroppa et al., 2007)). In an interactive context, it makes sense to let the user the opportunity to control for phrase sense by rejecting bad pivot phrases if she wants to, which is then similar to Callison-Burch’s experiment settings. This manual selection must of course be optional, but can be used when a user prefers a stricter control on mea</context>

The proposed ranking should reflect as best as possible the preferences of the user for the task at hand in order to minimize reading time and maintain the user’s interest in using the phrase lexicon. It is essential to give the user some control over how the results are returned depending on what is more important to her. For example, (Ferret and Zock, 2006) have proposed to present results from a dictionary enriched with topical associations in chunks to allow for categorial search. There will be cases where the user may find acceptable only grammatical results, while in other cases the user might accept agrammatical results provided they contain interesting suggestions. Moreover, it seems extremely important that result ranking can take into account the phrase substitution into the original context.

Indeed, those relationships denote the grammatical role of the words of the phrase relative to their context, and if those are preserved then it is more likely that meaning is preserved. We use a model based on dependency preservation (DEP) which involves relationships outside the rephrased phrase and relationships crossing a boundary of that phrase. The score is based on some proportion of the number of such dependencies found after substitution over the number of original dependencies (see (Max, 2008) for details). Another way of controlling for meaning preservation is to ensure that only the pivot phrases with the same meaning as the original phrase are kept (and then their back translations). (Callison-Burch, 2007) has shown the positive impact on paraphrase quality of using a controlled pivot present in an aligned sentence in a test bilingual corpora.

Moreover, dictionary lookups are in most cases insensitive to the actual context of words in an existing text. It is therefore the responsibility of its users to ensure that a choice is appropriate for a given context, which can be quite difficult, for example when writing in a second language. One way of obtaining phrase rephrasings is by looking at phrases that occur in similar contexts in a monolingual corpus (e.g. (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006)). In order to extract a comprehensive phrase lexicon, a very large number of sentences should be compared to extract potential rephrasings, which furthermore may often correspond to phrases that are too remotely connected. Parallel corpora provide the interesting advantage that it is reasonable to assume that elements from one side of the corpus should be aligned to elements on the other side, and that associations of elements can be reinforced by the number of times they occur in the corpus.

Like (Callison-Burch, 2007), we can use a language model (LM) to assess the local fluency of a sentence after a phrase has been substituted with a rephrasing.

For example, (Ferret and Zock, 2006) have proposed to present results from a dictionary enriched with topical associations in chunks to allow for categorial search. There will be cases where the user may find acceptable only grammatical results, while in other cases the user might accept agrammatical results provided they contain interesting suggestions. Moreover, it seems extremely important that result ranking can take into account the phrase substitution into the original context. Considering how the proposed phrase lexicon is built, the pivot paraphrasing probability of equation 1 (PIV) can be used as a baseline ordering. Su</context>

We then present an initial evaluation of our approach on French rephrasing in section 4. Related work is presented in section 5, and we finally discuss our approach and our future work in section 6. 2 Lexicon of phrase rephrasings Dictionaries and semantic resources such as thesauri can be used to find words by following links of different kinds from a given entry point. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is one such resource. For a proposal of other kinds of links and navigational aids see also (Zock and Bilac, 2004; Zock, 2006; Zock, 2007). Words are the traditional units that people expect to find in dictionaries. Whereas some types of dictionaries can contain multiword expressions, such as compound nouns and terms, those correspond to linguistically-motivated units. In order to rephrase phrases of any type with a dictionary, a writer may have to look up several words, combine various information and validate the result using her experience of the language or throught the use of a concordancer. Moreover, dictionary lookups are in most cases insensitive to the actual context of words in an existing text. It is therefore the res</context>
