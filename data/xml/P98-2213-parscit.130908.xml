This paper describes methods for relating (thread-
ing) multiple newspaper articles, and for visualizing
various characteristics of them by using a directed
graph. A set of articles is represented by a set of
word vectors, and the similarity between the vec-
tors is then calculated. The graph is constructed
from the similarity matrix. By applying some con-
straints on the chronological ordering of articles, an
efficient threading algorithm that runs in 0(n) time
(where n is the number of articles) is obtained. The
constructed graph is visualized with words that rep-
resent the topics of the threads, and words that rep-
resent new information in each article. The thread-
ing technique is suitable for Webcasting (push) ap-
plications. A threading server determines relation-
ships among articles from various news sources, and
creates files containing their threading information.
This information is represented in eXtended Markup
Language (XML), and can be visualized on most
Web browsers. The XML-based representation and
a current prototype are described in this paper.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972421301587302">
The vast quantity of information available today
makes it difficult to search for and understand the
information that we want. If there are many related
documents about a topic, it is important to capture
their relationships so that we can obtain a clearer
overview. However, most information resources, in-
cluding newspaper articles do not have explicit re-
lationships. For example, although documents on
the Web are connected by hyperlinks, relationships
cannot be specified.
Webcasting (&amp;quot;push&amp;quot;) applications such as Point-
cast 1 constitute a promising solution to the prob-
lem of information overloading, but the articles they
provide do not have links, or else must be manually
linked at a high cost in terms of time and effort.
This paper describes methods for relating news-
paper articles automatically, and its application for
a Webcasting application. A set of article on a par-
&apos;http://www.pointcast.com
ticular topic is ordered chronologically, and the re-
sults are represented as a directed graph. There are
various ways of relating documents and visualizing
their structure. For example, USENET articles can
be accessed by means of newsreader software. In the
system, a label (title) is attached to each posted mes-
sage, specifying whether it deals with a new topic or
is a reply to a previous message. A chain of articles
on a topic is called a thread. In this case, the rela-
tionships between the articles are explicitly defined.
This post/reply-based approach makes it possible for
a reader to group all the messages on a particular
topic. However, it is difficult to capture the story of
the thread from its thread structure, since appropri-
ate titles are not added to the messages.
This paper aims to provide ways of relating mul-
tiple news articles and representing their structure
in a way that is easy to understand and computa-
tionally inexpensive. A set of relationships is defined
here as a directed graph. A node indicates an arti-
cle, and an arc from node X to Y indicates that the
article X is followed by Y (or that X is adjacent to
Y). An article contains both known and unknown
(new) information. Known information consists of
words shared by the beginning and ending points of
an arc. When node X is adjacent to Y, the words
are represented by (X fl Y). The known information
is called genus words in this paper. Even if an article
follows another one, it generally contains some new
information. This information can be represented
by subtraction (Y — X) (Damashek, 1995), and is
called differentia words, by analogy with definition
sentences in dictionaries, which contain genus words
and differentia. In this paper, genus and differentiae
words are used to calculate the similarities between
two articles, and to visualize topics in a set of arti-
cles.
Since articles are ordered chronologically, there
are some time constraints on the connectivity of
nodes. A graph is created by constructing an ad-
jacency matrix for nodes, which in turn is created
from a similarity matrix for nodes.
Some potential features of articles in a set can be
determined by analyzing some formal aspects of the

corresponding graph. For example, the paths in the
graph show the stories of the nodes they contain.
Multiple paths for a node (article) show that there
are multiple stories associated with it. Furthermore,
if the node has a long path, it is in the &amp;quot;main stream&amp;quot;
of the topic represented by the graph. An efficient
algorithm for finding such paths is described, later
in the paper.
Application of the threading method to docu-
ments on the Web would be very useful because, al-
though such documents are connected by hyperlinks,
their relationships cannot be specified. In this paper,
generated threads by this method are represented in
eXtended Markup Language (XML) (XML, 1997),
which is the proposed standard for exchange of in-
formation on the Web. XML-based threads can be
used by webcasting or push services, since various
tools for parsing and visualizing threads are avail-
able.
In Section 2, a directed graph structure for arti-
cles is defined, and the procedure for constructing a
directed graph is described in Section 3. In Section
4, some features of the created graph are discussed.
Section 5 introduces a webcasting application by us-
ing the threading technique, and Section 6 concludes
the paper.
2 Definition of a Graph Structure
A set of articles is represented as an ordered set V:
V ={d1,d2,..• ,dn}•
The suffix sequence 1, 2, ... , n represents the pas-
sage of time. Article d, is older than d1+1. The order
is obtained from the publication dates of the articles.
Different time points arbitrarily are assigned to ar-
ticles published on the same day.
Related articles are represented as a directed
graph (V, A). V is a set of nodes. A is a set of
ordered pairs (i, j), where i and j are members of
V. Figure 1 shows an example of a directed graph.
In this case, the graph is represented as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.924014">
V = {di , d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d6, d7}, A = {(di , d2),
(d2,d3), 4), (d5,d6), (d2,d7), (d3,4), (d7,4)}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9927785">
The nodes are ordered chronologically. The fol-
lowing constraint is introduced into the graph:

3 Creating a Graph Structure for
Articles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992154666666667">
This section describes how to construct a directed
graph structure from a set of articles. Any directed
graph can be represented by a matrix. Figure 3
shows the adjacency matrix MG of the graph G in
Figure 1.
For example, a value of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; for the (1, 2) element
in M indicates that d1 is adjacent to d2. Since an
article cannot follow itself, the value of (i, i) elements
is &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;. From the time constraint defined in Section
3, MG is an upper triangle matrix.
The following is a procedure for constructing a
directed graph for related articles:

3.2 Constructing a similarity matrix
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.939210625">
A similarity matrix for a set of articles is constructed
by using the sim function. In a conventional hierar-
chical clustering algorithm, a similarity for any com-
bination of two articles is required in order to con-
struct a hierarchical tree of the set of articles. This
causes n(n2-1) calculations of the similarity func-
tion, for n articles, with a consequent complexity
of 0(n2). This is very expensive when n is large.
In our algorithm for constructing a similarity ma-
trix, shown in Figure 4, the complexity of construct-
ing a graph structure for an article set by using a
constraint is 0(n). The following constraint, which

includes Constraint 1, is used for in threading algo-
rithm.
Constraint 2
For (d„d3) E A, j — (k +1) &lt; i &lt; j
This constraint means that an article can only fol-
low the last k articles. As the result, the number of
times the similarity matrix needs to be calculated is
reduced by kn, giving a complexity of 0(n).
By using the algorithm, each similarity between
nodes is calculated, and the similarity matrix in Fig-
ure 5 shows a similarity matrix S of V. In this case,
keywords are extracted from title sentences, and k
is set to five.

3.3 Conversion into an adjacency matrix
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999274">
From the similarity matrix, an adjacency matrix is
constructed. An element s(i, j) in the similarity ma-
trix corresponds to the element ss(i, j) in the adja-
cency matrix SS. There are various strategies for the
conversion. In this paper, ss(i, j) is set to 1 when
s(i, j) &gt; 0.18, and any node can follow at most k/2
nodes, in this case two nodes. Figure 6 shows a re-
sult of the conversion. Finally, a directed graph for
V is created (Figure 7). Figure 8 shows a graph that
visualizes the content of the articles in our example.

There are two threads in the graph. One concerns
for France&apos;s restarting of nuclear testing. The other
concerns China&apos;s latest nuclear test. The &amp;quot;France&amp;quot;
thread contains two sub-threads. One concern re-
quests by other countries for France to reconsider its
stated intension of restarting nuclear testing, and the
other concerns responses by other countries to the
France government&apos;s official statement on testing.
Some articles are followed by multiple articles. For
example, cl7 is the first official statement on France&apos;s
restarting of nuclear testing, and many related arti-
cles on this topic follow.
Each rectangle in Figure 8 represents an article.
Words in a rectangle are differentia words for the
articles. These words show new information in the
article, and make it easy to understand the content
of the articles. If a word in an article appears in
the differentia words for its parent article, the word
may represent a &amp;quot;turning point&amp;quot; in the story of the
articles. For example, the word &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; is the dif-
ferentia word for cl7, and is in its adjacent articles
c/8, d9, and d10. This means that cl7 is a starting point
of the new topic &amp;quot;state.&amp;quot; Such words are called topic
words, and are represented in Figure 8 by bold type.
Several features of the graph visualize the charac-
teristics and relationships of the articles: these fea-
tures will be discussed in the next section.
It is difficult to evaluate the result of threading.
We are implementing it in a webcasting (push) ap-
plication so that it can be evaluated by the many
people who use ordinary web browsers. The attempt
is described in Section 5.

The in-degree is the number of arcs leading to a node,
while the out-degree is the number of arcs leading
from it. The in-degree of d, can be calculated by
adding up the elements in the i-th column of an adja-
cency matrix. The out-degree of d, can be calculated
by adding up the elements in the i-th row of the ma-
trix (Figure 9). In Botafogo et al. (Botafogo et al.,
1992), a node that has a high out-degree is called an
index node, while a node that has a high in-degree is
called a reference node in their analysis of hypertext.
In the set of articles V shown in Figure 9, d7 is an
index node. In this paper, an index node denotes the
beginning of a new topic. When the topic is impor-

degree for the node increases. The contribution of
reference nodes is not clear in V (d6, 4, and d9 have
max in-degrees). Nodes that have high in-degree
have two characteristics. The first is that when the
articles contain multiple topics, they have many in-
bound arcs, each representing a different topic. The
second is that when the articles are closely related
for a particular topic, the in-degrees of related nodes
increase, since these articles are connected to each
other.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.954344">
4.2 Path
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875714285714">
A path from one node to another node shows the
&amp;quot;story flow&amp;quot; of articles. Multiple paths between
two nodes show different stories about the nodes.
For example, there are three paths between d1,
which is a first node, and d10. The shortest path
(d1, d2„ d7, d10) gives a simple outline of the articles.
The longest path (di , d2, d7, ds, ds, dio) contains all
related information on the topic. By extracting long
paths from the graph and combining them, various
stories can be created.
The length of a path shows how the nodes on it
elong to the &amp;quot;main stream&amp;quot; of the story. For ex-
mple, the maximum length of a path through d6, is
three, while that of a path through d7 is five. This
means that a path that contains d7 is on a main
stream of the thread and is likely to be continued.
The longest paths for nodes can be calculated by
using the algorithm shown in Figure 11. Its com-
plexity is 0(n), since the maximum number of arcs
is at most nk for n nodes, from Constraint 2, defined
in Section 3.2.

A cycle3 shows the existence of a topic. In V,

By recognizing cycles, we can extract topics from the
whole graph. Furthermore, we can abstract articles
by reducing cycles to single nodes.

It is important that the threading information be ex-

attributes can be defined, whereas in HTML they
are fixed. XML documents can be used to exchange
information that has various data structure. For
example, Channel Definition Format (CDF)(CDF,
1997) is a standard to offer frequently updated col-
lections of information (channels) on Web. A CDF
document can contains a collection of articles that
have tree structure. In this paper, graph structures
of created threads are represented in XML. Figure 10
shows a part of the thread in Figure 8.
The &lt;thread&gt; tag shows the beginning of the
thread. It contains a set of deceptions for arti-
cles, each marked &lt;art icle&gt;. Each instance of
the &lt;art icle&gt; tag has a reference to its source
document, an identifying id, genus and differentia
words, and other information on the article. The
tag &lt;follows&gt; is used to denote arcs from the ar-
ticle to related articles.
The XML documents can be separate from the
source articles. They can be provided as part of a
&amp;quot;push&amp;quot; service for Internet users, offering a solution
to the problem of information overloading. In such
a service, gatherer collects articles from Web sites
and threader makes threads for them. The results
are stored in XML, and then pushed to subscribers
who can capture the flow of topics by following the
threads. In another scenario, when a user gets an
article, and wants to see its origin or the next re-
lated article, he or she gets the thread containing
the article by consulting the threading server. The
advantage of using XML is that it will be supported
by various tools, including Web browsers. Now we
are prototyping the threading service system by us-
ing a XML processor developed at our laboratory.
Figure 12 shows a Java applet for viewing threads,
which can run on major Web browsers. A XML doc-
ument is parsed and visualized as tree-like structure.

There have been several studies how to relate arti-
cles (McKeown et at., 1995; Yamamoto et at., 1995;
Mani et at., 1997). McKeown et al. reported a
method for summarizing news articles (McKeown
et at., 1995). In their approach, templates, which
have slots and their values (for example, incident-
location= &amp;quot;New York&amp;quot;), are extracted from the ar-
ticles. Summary sentences are constructed by com-

capture topics contained in the articles, the relation-
ships between articles are not visualized.
Clustering techniques make it possible to visual-
ize the contents of a set of documents. Hearst et
al. proposed the scatter/gather approach for facil-
itating information retrieval (Hearst et at., 1995).
Maarek et al. related documents by using an hier-
archical clustering algorithm that interacts with the
user. Although these clustering algorithms impose a

We have described methods for threading multiple
articles and for visualizing various characteristics of
them by using directed graphs. An efficient thread-
ing algorithm whose complexity is 0(n) (where n is
the number of articles) was introduced with some
constraints on the chronological ordering of articles.
Some further work can be done to improve our
method. There are sothe strategies for constructing
an adjacency matrix from a distance matrix. Differ-
ent strategies give different graphs. We are now eval-
uating our method by testing it with various strate-
gies.
The development of a technique for visualizing di-
rected graphs is another task for the future. Al-
though directed graphs show more useful informa-
tion than tree structures, they are difficult to display
in a readily understandable way. Software tools for
handling graphs are also required.
Formal features of graphs can express the under-
lying characteristics of articles. More efficient and
useful algorithms are needed to overcome the prob-
lem of information overload.

<abstract confidence="0.973728363636364">This paper describes methods for relating (threading) multiple newspaper articles, and for visualizing various characteristics of them by using a directed graph. A set of articles is represented by a set of word vectors, and the similarity between the vectors is then calculated. The graph is constructed from the similarity matrix. By applying some constraints on the chronological ordering of articles, an threading algorithm that runs in (where n is the number of articles) is obtained. The constructed graph is visualized with words that represent the topics of the threads, and words that represent new information in each article. The threading technique is suitable for Webcasting (push) applications. A threading server determines relationships among articles from various news sources, and creates files containing their threading information. This information is represented in eXtended Markup Language (XML), and can be visualized on most Web browsers. The XML-based representation and a current prototype are described in this paper.</abstract>

The attempt is described in Section 5. 4 Features of a Graph This section describes how the features of a constructed graph represent the characteristics of articles. 4.1 In-degree and Out-degree The in-degree is the number of arcs leading to a node, while the out-degree is the number of arcs leading from it. The in-degree of d, can be calculated by adding up the elements in the i-th column of an adjacency matrix. The out-degree of d, can be calculated by adding up the elements in the i-th row of the matrix (Figure 9). In Botafogo et al. (Botafogo et al., 1992), a node that has a high out-degree is called an index node, while a node that has a high in-degree is called a reference node in their analysis of hypertext. In the set of articles V shown in Figure 9, d7 is an index node. In this paper, an index node denotes the beginning of a new topic. When the topic is important, many articles follow, and consequently the out1310 d3 d6 dl France restart nuclear d2 tesing suggest Defence Ministe France restart nuclear testing d4 d5 China latest China hold-up negotiation treaty Mr. Yohei Kohno attitude understand Japan position Summit request request New Ze</context>

A node indicates an article, and an arc from node X to Y indicates that the article X is followed by Y (or that X is adjacent to Y). An article contains both known and unknown (new) information. Known information consists of words shared by the beginning and ending points of an arc. When node X is adjacent to Y, the words are represented by (X fl Y). The known information is called genus words in this paper. Even if an article follows another one, it generally contains some new information. This information can be represented by subtraction (Y — X) (Damashek, 1995), and is called differentia words, by analogy with definition sentences in dictionaries, which contain genus words and differentia. In this paper, genus and differentiae words are used to calculate the similarities between two articles, and to visualize topics in a set of articles. Since articles are ordered chronologically, there are some time constraints on the connectivity of nodes. A graph is created by constructing an adjacency matrix for nodes, which in turn is created from a similarity matrix for nodes. Some potential features of articles in a set can be determined by analyzing some for</context>
