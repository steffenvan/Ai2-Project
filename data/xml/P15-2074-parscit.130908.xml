In Tibetan, as words are written consecutive-
ly without delimiters, finding unknown word
boundary is difficult. This paper presents a
hybrid approach for Tibetan unknown word
identification for offline corpus processing.
Firstly, Tibetan named entity is preprocessed
based on natural annotation. Secondly, other
Tibetan unknown words are extracted from
word segmentation fragments using MTC,
the combination of a statistical metric and a
set of context sensitive rules. In addition, the
preliminary experimental results on Tibetan
News Corpus are reported. Lexicon-based
Tibetan word segmentation system SegT with
proposed unknown word extension mecha-
nism is indeed helpful to promote the perfor-
mance of Tibetan word segmentation. It in-
creases the F-score of Tibetan word segmen-
tation by 4.15% on random-selected test set.
Our unknown word identification scheme can
find new words in any length and in any field.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999966833333333">
Tibetan is a phonetic writing script; it is syllabic,
like many of the alphabets of India and South
East Asia. Tibetan sentences are strings of sylla-
bles with no delimiters to mark word boundaries.
Therefore the initial step for Tibetan processing
is word segmentation. However, occurrences of
unknown words, which are not listed in the
dictionary, degraded significantly the perfor-
mances of most word segmentation methods.
Currently, the lexicon-based Tibetan word
segmentation scheme is widely adopted. In gen-
eral, any lexicon is limited and unable to cover
all the words in real texts. According to our sta-
tistics on a 326,062,576-bytes news corpus from
the website Tibet Daily, there are about 2.89%
unknown words. Therefore, unknown word iden-
tification (UWI) became a key technology for
Tibetan segmentation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we recall related work on UWI
methods. Semi-automatic Tibetan UWI method
is provided in Section 3. Section 4 gives the de-
scription of experimental results for evaluation,
and Section 5 offers concluding remarks.

For unknown words with more regular morpho-
logical structures, such as personal names, mor-
phological rules are commonly used for im-
proving the performance by restricting the
structures of extracted words (Chen et al. 1994,
Sun et al. 1995, Lin et al. 1993, Ma &amp; Chen
2003). However, it is not possible to list morpho-
logical rules for all kinds of unknown words,
especially those words with very irregular struc-
tures. Therefore, statistical approaches usually
play major roles on irregular UWI in most previ-
ous work (Sproat &amp; Shih 1990, Chiang et al.
1992, Tung &amp; Lee 1995, Palmer 1997, Chang et
al. 1997, Sun et al. 1998, Ge et al. 1999).
Many statistical metrics have been proposed,
including point-wise mutual information (MI)
(Church et al., 1991), mean and variance, hy-
pothesis testing (t-test, chi-square test, etc.), log-
likelihood ratio (LR) (Dunning, 1993), statistic
language model (Tomokiyo et al., 2003), con-
text-entropy (on each side) and frequency ratio
against background corpus (Luo &amp; Song 2004),
DCF (Hong et al., 2009), and so on. Point-wise
MI is often used to find interesting bigrams (col-
locations). However, MI is actually better to
think of it as a measure of independence than of
dependence (Manning et al., 1999). LR is one of
the most stable methods for automatic term ex-
traction so far, and more appropriate for sparse
data than other metrics. However, LR is still bi-
ased to two frequent words that are rarely adja-
cent, such as the pair (the, the) (Pantel et al.,
2001). On the other aspect, MI and LR metrics

are difficult to extend to extract multi-word
terms.
There are also many hybrid methods com-
bined statistical metrics with linguistic
knowledge and machine Learning algorithms,
such as Part-of-Speech filters (Smadja, 1994;
Asanee, 1997), roles tagging based (Zhang et al.,
2002), syntactic discriminators (Chen &amp; Ma
2002), max-margin Markov networks (Qiao and
Sun, 2010; Li and Chang, 2010), Unsupervised
Learning Strategy (Sun et al., 2004), Latent Dis-
criminative Model(Sun et al., 2011), boosting-
based ensemble learning (TeCho et al., 2012).
But POS filters, roles tagging, machine learning
algorithms does not work for Tibetan UWI. So
far, there is no Tibetan POS tagger and Tibetan
parser. We have built large scale Tibetan text
resources recently, and we are tagging Part-Of-
Speech and labeling role right now, these corpora
can form training set in the near future.
Previous research and work in Tibetan word
segmentation have made great progresses. How-
ever, cases with unknown words are not satisfac-
tory. In recent years, researchers mainly use
maximum-matching method accompanying with
some grammar rules (Chen et al. 2003a, Chen et
al. 2003b, Cai 2009a, Cai 2009b, Qi 2006, Dolha
2007, Zha 2007, Tashi 2009) to segment Tibetan
text. Liu et al. (2012) designed and implemented
a Tibetan word segmentation system named
“SegT” which is lexicon-based practical system
with a constant lexicon. However, it has the dif-
ficulty of identifying unknown words in newspa-
per articles and web documents which are highly
changeable texts with time.
The research on Tibetan UWI is, however, still
at its initial stage. There is no public report of
performance of Tibetan new word or unknown
word identification. This paper introduces Tibet-
an UWI work which is in progress.

Generally, Tibetan location name and organiza-
tion names are formed from a shorter word or
proper noun adding a morpheme, river(;Y),
lake(0&apos;49), beach(s&apos;,i), gorge(`4 i), ministry(%(3),
bureau(N), association(r&amp;quot;&apos;,), company(&apos;Z&apos;,i�),
province(�&apos;,i��), city(0&apos;,i�% county(�&apos;,) etc.; some
are also followed by modifiers, such as postposi-
tion, size, color, shape. We also observe that of-
ten, these morphemes are segmented separately
during the first-time segmentation process. “Nat-
ural annotation” in our news articles also indi-
cates the occurrence of unknown words. This
section simply introduces Tibetan script first and
then aims to detail the two key procedures in Ti-
betan UWI from Tibetan web resources, that is,
detect unknown words based on natural annota-

3.1 Characteristics of Tibetan Script

<bodyText confidence="0.999825785714285">
The Tibetan alphabet is syllabic; a syllable con-
tains one or up to seven character(s). Syllables
are separated by a marker known as intersyllabic
marks (tsheg), which is simply a superscripted
dot. Linguistic words are made up of one or more
syllables and are also separated by the same
symbol, “tsheg”. Consonant clusters are written
with special conjunct letters. Tibetan texts con-
sists of a string of syllables without any blanks to
mark word boundaries except for punctuation’l’,
called shad, at the end of each sentence, and ‘i’,
called tsheg, within syllables. Figure 1 shows the
structure of a Tibetan word which is made up of
two syllables and means “show” or “exhibition”.

Tibetan sentence consists of one or more
words, phrases or multi-word units. Another
marker known as “shad” indicates the sentence
boundary, which looks like a vertical pipe. Fig-
ure 2 shows a Tibetan sentence. It is segmented
in line 2 and word by word translation is given in
line 3.

Tibetan unknown word covers both named entity
and emerging new words in Tibetan web corpus.

tematic way for various tasks of natural language
processing, for examples, punctuation marks in
Tibetan can benefit word boundaries identifica-
tion, social tags in social media can benefit key-
word extraction, “categories” given in News
Corpus can benefit text categorization.
“Space”, “punctuation” and “Tibetan auxiliary
words” always appear next to a word. Hyperlink
in web text is a useful explicit natural annotation
too. In addition, &lt;head&gt; tag of html pages in-
cluding meta data as keywords, author, source,
description; these are also quite useful natural
annotation for UWI. Meanwhile, in our Tibetan
News Corpus, English and Chinese in brackets
give the hints for their corresponding Tibetan
translation words. Sentences including this kind
of annotation are as follow.

We will use a hybrid method MTC, that is, com-
bination of statistical metric and context sensitive
rules, to recognize the boundary of an unknown
word. It is applied to segmented texts.
Beforehand, we analyse the lexicon-based pre-
segmentation of a sentence. Unknown words in
the text would be incorrectly segmented into
pieces of single syllable or shorter words through
pre- segmentation.
Figure 3 illustrates two possible pre-
segmented results of syllable string, that is, ex-
plicit unknown words in above expression or
hidden unknown word in below expression.

Column II in Table 1 is the correct segmenta-
tion of these unknown words. After maximum-
matching word segmentation, it is segmented to
the content in column I. Almost all these un-
known words in our corpus are segmented into
monosyllables because these words are not in-
cluded in our Tibetan word segmentation lexi-
con.
At detection stages, the contextual rules were
applied to detect fragments of unknown words,
i.e. monosyllabic morphemes. Since it is hard to
derive a set of morphological rules, which exact-
ly cover all types of unknown words, statistical
rules are designed without differentiate their ex-
tracted word types.

A corpus-based learning method is proposed
to derive a set of rules for monosyllabic words
and monosyllabic morphemes. The idea is that if
two consecutive morphemes are highly associat-
ed then combines them to form a new word.
For each bi-seed-gram, the mutual information
MI and t-score are calculated. These scores re-
flect the co-occurrence affinity between the two
tokens of the bi-gram. These two scores are cal-
culated by the following formulas:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.917619">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999380666666667">
where, a, b, c and d are elements of a contingen-
cy table. For example, given a bi-gram contain-
ing tokens x and y,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.852085">
a = number of bi-grams in which both x and y
occur;
b = number of bi-grams in which only x occurs;
c = number of bi-grams in which only y occurs;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9938175">
d = number of bi-grams in which neither x nor y
occurs.
Another measure for Tibetan UWI is seed ex-
tension confidence. Denote Tibetan word (or syl-
lable) grouping of n-grams as ST (n) , where n
indicates the length of current word; Extend it to
an adjacent Tibetan syllable and get ST (n + 1) , so
the seed extension confidence defined as:

in which Wmean and indicates the mean of
MI and t-value in the scope of extended Tibetan
word respectively.
To characterize Tibetan unknown words and
their boundaries the extension step will be held.
For each extension-ready Tibetan seed word,
note the extension confidence C„ ; if is greater
than the threshold, current Tibetan word is ac-
cepted, and extension continues; when is less
than the threshold extension stops. Boundary for
Tibetan unknown word is obtained at the end of
extension. Figure 4 shows the detail of extension
process. High frequency bi-seed-gram can be
extended to an unknown word (which is in

We have built the largest Tibetan text resources
over the internet via an automatic crawler. They
are from three web sites, that are, Tibet Daily,
People’s Daily and Qinghai Daily. This News
Corpus includes different fields such as politics,
science, technology, education, language and
culture, religion, tourism, environment and Ti-
betan medicine. Presently, other types of text,
especially informal discussion on social network
like Twitter and Wikipedia in Tibetan is in small
size. Thus, we will utilize above Tibetan News
Corpus to extract likely new words in this paper.
Our evaluation data contains 12,027 words from

After analyzing the results, we find that
wrongly identified words can be divided into two
classes, i.e., Tibetan person name and translit-
erated names. We will add deictic words into
context sensitive rule and supplement translitera-
tion table to promote identification accuracy of
these kinds of unknown words.
4.3 Evaluation for Tibetan Word Segmen-
tation with the Extended Lexicon
In order to validate the effect of our unknown
word identification on Tibetan word segmenta-
tion, we conduct following experiments.
In a typical word segmentation system, once a
text is segmented using the available lexicon or
heuristic rules, the segmentation process is fin-
ished. We observe that unknown words make up
0.5% to 4% of all the words in our Tibetan news
articles. Therefore, UWI is an important issue for
a word segmentation algorithm. We add a semi-
automatic unknown word identification compo-
nent to the back-end of the whole segmentation
process.
We will evaluate the precision (Pseg), recall
(Rseg), f-score (Fseg) of Tibetan word segmenta-
tion in this subsection.
where I segl denotes the number of correctly seg-
mented Tibetan words; denotes total num-
ber of segmented Tibetan words; denotes
the total number of Tibetan words in the testing
texts.
The segmentation of original web texts uses a
basic Segmentor (SegT (Liu et al, 2012)) and a
general lexicon (with 220,000 Tibetan entries).
Unknown words (out of our lexicon) are seg-
mented into pieces in this step. The following
process is to detect possible unknown words
from word segmentation fragment which are
very likely to be words. We will compare lexi-
con-based Tibetan segmenter with and without
unknown word identification component on our
evaluation data. Presently, there is no Tibetan
word segmentation specification and standard; in
addition, there is no large and publicly available
Tibetan training corpus. Thus make comparison
with other research papers is difficult. We choose
the best Tibetan word segmentation system Liu’s
SegT (Liu et al. 2012) as baseline.
Table 2 illustrates the results of Tibetan seg-
mentation by SegT with general lexicon and
SegT with lexicon extension on evaluation.

od in section 3 has been applied to semi-

increased by 5.49%, 2.71%, 4.15% respectively

increased significantly because of the higher

In this paper, we present a hybrid method for
Tibetan unknown word identification. Its f-score
reaches around 80%. Compared with English or
Chinese unknown word recognition work, the
proposed methods doesn’t achieve satisfactory
results, however, preliminary experimental re-
sults demonstrate that SegT with proposed un-
known word extension mechanism is indeed
helpful to promote Tibetan word segmentation
performance. In the future, the evaluation of pro-
posed method needs to be extended to large-scale
test corpus and detailed context sensitive rules
are used to identify Tibetan unknown words.

<abstract confidence="0.971725807692308">minghua@iscas.ac.cn huidan@iscas.ac.cn congjun@nfs.iscas.ac.cn wujian@iscas.ac.cn of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; of Ethnology and Anthropology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing, China Abstract In Tibetan, as words are written consecutively without delimiters, finding unknown word boundary is difficult. This paper presents a hybrid approach for Tibetan unknown word identification for offline corpus processing. Firstly, Tibetan named entity is preprocessed based on natural annotation. Secondly, other Tibetan unknown words are extracted from word segmentation fragments using MTC, the combination of a statistical metric and a set of context sensitive rules. In addition, the preliminary experimental results on Tibetan News Corpus are reported. Lexicon-based Tibetan word segmentation system SegT with proposed unknown word extension mechanism is indeed helpful to promote the performance of Tibetan word segmentation. It increases the F-score of Tibetan word segmentation by 4.15% on random-selected test set. Our unknown word identification scheme can find new words in any length and in any field.</abstract>

However, it is not possible to list morphological rules for all kinds of unknown words, especially those words with very irregular structures. Therefore, statistical approaches usually play major roles on irregular UWI in most previous work (Sproat &amp; Shih 1990, Chiang et al. 1992, Tung &amp; Lee 1995, Palmer 1997, Chang et al. 1997, Sun et al. 1998, Ge et al. 1999). Many statistical metrics have been proposed, including point-wise mutual information (MI) (Church et al., 1991), mean and variance, hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square test, etc.), loglikelihood ratio (LR) (Dunning, 1993), statistic language model (Tomokiyo et al., 2003), context-entropy (on each side) and frequency ratio against background corpus (Luo &amp; Song 2004), DCF (Hong et al., 2009), and so on.

We have built large scale Tibetan text resources recently, and we are tagging Part-OfSpeech and labeling role right now, these corpora can form training set in the near future. Previous research and work in Tibetan word segmentation have made great progresses. However, cases with unknown words are not satisfactory. In recent years, researchers mainly use maximum-matching method accompanying with some grammar rules (Chen et al. 2003a, Chen et al. 2003b, Cai 2009a, Cai 2009b, Qi 2006, Dolha 2007, Zha 2007, Tashi 2009) to segment Tibetan text. Liu et al. (2012) designed and implemented a Tibetan word segmentation system named “SegT” which is lexicon-based practical system with a constant lexicon. However, it has the difficulty of identifying unknown words in newspaper articles and web documents which are highly changeable texts with time. The research on Tibetan UWI is, however, still at its initial stage. There is no public report of performance of Tibetan new word or unknown word identification. This paper introduces Tibetan UWI work which is in progress. 3 Tibetan Unknown Word Identification from News Corpus Generally, Tibetan location name and o</context>

Therefore, UWI is an important issue for a word segmentation algorithm. We add a semiautomatic unknown word identification component to the back-end of the whole segmentation process. We will evaluate the precision (Pseg), recall (Rseg), f-score (Fseg) of Tibetan word segmentation in this subsection. where I segl denotes the number of correctly segmented Tibetan words; denotes total number of segmented Tibetan words; denotes the total number of Tibetan words in the testing texts. The segmentation of original web texts uses a basic Segmentor (SegT (Liu et al, 2012)) and a general lexicon (with 220,000 Tibetan entries). Unknown words (out of our lexicon) are segmented into pieces in this step. The following process is to detect possible unknown words from word segmentation fragment which are very likely to be words. We will compare lexicon-based Tibetan segmenter with and without unknown word identification component on our evaluation data. Presently, there is no Tibetan word segmentation specification and standard; in addition, there is no large and publicly available Tibetan training corpus. Thus make comparison with other research papers is difficult.</context>

Many statistical metrics have been proposed, including point-wise mutual information (MI) (Church et al., 1991), mean and variance, hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square test, etc.), loglikelihood ratio (LR) (Dunning, 1993), statistic language model (Tomokiyo et al., 2003), context-entropy (on each side) and frequency ratio against background corpus (Luo &amp; Song 2004), DCF (Hong et al., 2009), and so on. Point-wise MI is often used to find interesting bigrams (collocations). However, MI is actually better to think of it as a measure of independence than of dependence (Mannin</context>
