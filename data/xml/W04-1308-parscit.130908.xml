<bodyText confidence="0.999968258064516">
Mainstream linguistic theory has traditionally
assumed that children come into the world
with rich innate knowledge about language
and grammar. More recently, computational
work using distributional algorithms has
shown that the information contained in the
input is much richer than proposed by the na-
tivist approach. However, neither of these ap-
proaches has been developed to the point of
providing detailed and quantitative predictions
about the developmental data. In this paper,
we champion a third approach, in which com-
putational models learn from naturalistic input
and produce utterances that can be directly
compared with the utterances of language-
learning children. We demonstrate the feasi-
bility of this approach by showing how
MOSAIC, a simple distributional analyser,
simulates the optional-infinitive phenomenon
in English, Dutch, and Spanish. The model ac-
counts for young children’s tendency to use
both correct finites and incorrect (optional) in-
finitives in finite contexts, for the generality of
this phenomenon across languages, and for the
sparseness of other types of errors (e.g., word
order errors). It thus shows how these phe-
nomena, which have traditionally been taken
as evidence for innate knowledge of Universal
Grammar, can be explained in terms of a sim-
ple distributional analysis of the language to
which children are exposed.

Children acquiring the syntax of their native lan-
guage are faced with a task of considerable com-
plexity, which they must solve using only noisy
and potentially inconsistent input. Mainstream lin-
guistic theory has addressed this ‘learnability prob-
lem’ by proposing the nativist hypothesis that chil-
dren come into the world with rich innate knowl-
edge about language and grammar (Chomsky,
1981; Piattelli-Palmarini, 2002; Pinker, 1984).

However, there is also strong empirical evidence
that the amount of information present in the input
is considerably greater than has traditionally been
assumed by the nativist approach. In particular,
computer simulations have shown that a distribu-
tional analysis of the statistics of the input can pro-
vide a significant amount of syntactic information
(Redington &amp; Chater, 1997).
One limitation of the distributional approach is
that analyses have rarely been done with naturalis-
tic input (e.g. mothers’ child-directed speech) and
have so far not been linked to the detailed analysis
of a linguistic phenomenon found in human data,
(e.g., Christiansen &amp; Chater, 2001). Indeed, neither
the nativist nor the distributional approach has
been developed to the point of providing detailed
and quantitative predictions about the developmen-
tal dynamics of the acquisition of language. In
order to remedy this weakness, our group has re-
cently been exploring a different approach. This
approach, which we think is a more powerful way
of understanding how children acquire their native
language, has involved developing a computational
model (MOSAIC; Model Of Syntax Acquisition In
Children) that learns from naturalistic input, and
produces utterances that can be directly compared
with the utterances of language-learning children.
This makes it possible to derive quantitative pre-
dictions about empirical phenomena observed in
children learning different languages and about the
developmental dynamics of these phenomena.
MOSAIC, which is based upon a simple distri-
butional analyser, has been used to simulate a
number of phenomena in language acquisition.
These include: the verb-island phenomenon (Gobet
&amp; Pine, 1997; Jones, Gobet, &amp; Pine, 2000); nega-
tion errors in English (Croker, Pine, &amp; Gobet,
2003); patterns of pronoun case marking error in
English (Croker, Pine, &amp; Gobet, 2001); patterns of
subject omission error in English (Freudenthal,
Pine, &amp; Gobet, 2002b); and the optional-infinitive
phenomenon (Freudenthal, Pine, &amp; Gobet, 2001,
2002a, 2003). MOSAIC has also been used to
simulate data from three different languages (Eng-
lish, Dutch, and Spanish), which has helped us to

The optional infinitive phenomenon is particu-
larly interesting as it occurs in languages that differ
considerably in their underlying grammar, and is
subject to considerable developmental and cross-
linguistic variation. It is also intriguing because
children in the optional infinitive stage typically
make few other grammatical errors. For example,
they make few errors in their use of the basic word
order of their language: English-speaking children
may say he go, but not go he.
Technically, the optional infinitive phenomenon
revolves around the notion of ‘finiteness’. Finite
forms are forms that are marked for Tense and/or
Agreement (e.g. went, goes). Non-finite forms are
forms that are not marked for Tense or Agreement.
This includes the infinitive form (go), the past par-
ticiple (gone), and the progressive participle (go-
ing). In English, finiteness marking increases with
development: as they grow older, children produce
an increasing proportion of unambiguous finite
forms.

4 Description of the model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993173658536585">
MOSAIC is a computational model that analyses
the distributional characteristics present in the in-
put. It learns to produce increasingly long utter-
ances from naturalistic (child-directed) input, and
produces output consisting of actual utterances,
which can be directly compared to children’s
speech. This allows for a direct comparison of the
output of the model at different stages with the
children’s developmental data.
The model learns from text-based input (i.e., it is
assumed that the phonological stream has been
segmented into words). Utterances are processed in
a left to right fashion. MOSAIC uses two learning
mechanisms, based on discrimination and generali-
sation, respectively. The first mechanism grows an
n-ary discrimination network (Feigenbaum &amp;
Simon, 1984; Gobet et al., 2001) consisting of
nodes connected by test links. Nodes encode single
words or phrases. Test links encode the difference
between the contents of consecutive nodes. (Figure
1 illustrates the structure of the type of discrimina-
tion net used.) As the model sees more and more
input, the number of nodes and links increases, and
so does the amount of information held in the
nodes, and, as a consequence, the average length of
the phrases it can output. The node creation prob-
ability (NCP) is computed as follows:
NCP = (N / M)L
where M is a parameter arbitrarily set to 70,000 in
the English and Spanish simulations, N = number
of nodes in the net (N :5 M), and L = length of the
phrase being encoded. Node creation probability is
thus dependent both on the length of the utterance
(longer utterances are less likely to yield learning)
and on the amount of knowledge already acquired.
In a small net, learning is slow. When the number
of nodes in the net increases, the node creation
probability increases and, as a result, the learning
rate also increases. This is consistent with data
showing that children learn new words more easily
as they get older (Bates &amp; Carnavale, 1993).

net. The Figure also illustrates how an utterance
can be generated. Because she and he have a gen-
erative link, the model can output the novel utter-
ance she sings. (For simplicity, preceding context
is ignored in this Figure.)
While the first learning mechanism is based on
discrimination, the second is based on generalisa-
tion. When two nodes share a certain percentage
(set to 10% for these simulations) of nodes
(phrases) following and preceding them, a new
type of link, a generative link is created between
them (see Figure 1 for an example). Generative
links connect words that have occurred in similar
contexts in the input, and thus are likely to be of
the same word class. As no linguistic constructs
are given to the model, the development of ap-
proximate linguistic classes, such as those of noun
or verb, is an emergent property of the distribu-
tional analysis of the input. An important feature of
MOSAIC is that the creation and removal of gen-
erative links is dynamic. Since new nodes are con-
stantly being created in the network, the percentage
overlap between two nodes varies over time; as a

consequence, a generative link may drop below the
threshold and so be removed.
The model generates output by traversing the
network and outputting the contents of the visited
links. When the model traverses test links only, the
utterances it produces must have been present in
the input. Where the model traverses generative
links during output, novel utterances can be gener-
ated. An utterance is generated only if its final
word was the final word in the utterance when it
was encoded (this is accomplished by the use of an
end marker). Thus, the model is biased towards
generating utterances from sentence final position,
which is consistent with empirical data from lan-
guage-learning children (Naigles &amp; Hoff-Ginsberg,
1998; Shady &amp; Gerken, 1999; Wijnen, Kempen, &amp;
Gillis, 2001).

5 Modelling the optional-infinitive phenome-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945571428571">
Despite the theoretical interest of the optional-
infinitive phenomenon, there is, to our knowledge,
no quantitative description of the developmental
dynamics of the use of optional infinitives in Eng-
lish, with detail comparable to that provided in
other languages, such as Dutch (Wijnen et al.,
2001). The following analyses fill this gap.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998476">
5.1 Children’s data: Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887871794872">
We selected the speech of two children (Anne,
from 1 year 10 months to 2 years 9 months; and
Becky, from 2 years to 2 years 11 months). These
data were taken from the Manchester corpus
(Theakston, Lieven, Pine, &amp; Rowland, 2001),
which is available in the CHILDES data base
(MacWhinney, 2000). Recordings were made
twice every three weeks over a period of one year
and lasted for approximately one hour per session.
Given that optional-infinitive phenomena are
harder to identify in English than in languages such
as Dutch or German (due to the relatively low
number of unambiguous finite forms), the analysis
focused on the subset of utterances that contain a
verb with he, she, it, this (one), or that (one) as its
subject. Restricting the analysis in this way avoids
utterances such as I go, which could be classified
both as non-finite and finite, and therefore makes it
possible to more clearly separate non-finites, sim-
ple finites, compound finites, and ambiguous utter-
ances.
Identical (automatic) analyses of the data and
model were carried out in a way consistent with
previous work on Dutch (Wijnen et al., 2001). Ut-
terances that had the copula (i.e., forms of the verb
to be) as a main verb were removed. Utterances
that contained a non-finite form as the only verb
were classified as non-finites. Utterances with an
unambiguous finite form (walks, went) were
counted as finite, while those containing a finite
verb form plus a non-finite form (has gone) were
classified as compound finites. The remaining ut-
terances were classified as ambiguous and counted
separately; they contained an ambiguous form
(such as bought in he bought) as the main verb,
which can be classified either as a finite past tense
form or as a (non-finite) perfect participle (in the
phrase he bought, the word has may have been
omitted).

5.2 Children’s data: Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982222222222">
The children’s speech was partitioned into three
developmental stages, defined by mean length of
utterance (MLU). The resulting distributions, por-
trayed in Figure 2, show that the proportion of non-
finites decreases as a function of MLU, while the
proportion of compound finites increases. There is
also a slight increase in the proportion of simple
finites, although this is much less pronounced than
the increase in the proportion of compound finites.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993728">
5.3 Simulations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994606060606">
The model received as input speech from the chil-
dren’s respective mothers. The size of the input
was 33,000 utterances for Anne’s model, and
27,000 for Becky’s model. Note that, while the
analyses are restricted to a subset of the children’s
corpora, the entire mothers’ corpora were used as
input during learning. The input was fed through
the model several times, and output was generated
after every run of the model, until the MLU of the
output was comparable to that of the end stage in
the two children. The output files were then com-
pared to the children’s data on the basis of MLU.
The model shows a steady decline in the propor-
tion of non-finites as a function of MLU coupled
with a steady increase in the proportion of com-
pound finites (Figure 3). On average, the model’s
production of optional infinitives in third person
singular contexts drops from an average of 31.5%
to 16% compared with 47% to 12.5% in children.
MOSAIC thus provides a good fit to the develop-
mental pattern in the children’s data (not including
the ‘ambiguous’ category: r2 = .65, p &lt; .01, RMSD
= 0.096 for Anne and her model; r2 = .88, p &lt; .001,
RMSD = 0.104 for Becky and her model). One
obvious discrepancy between the model’s and the
children’s output is that both models at MLU 2.1
produce too many simple finite utterances. Further
inspection of these utterances reveals that they
contain a relatively high proportion of finite mo-
dals such as can and will and finite forms of the
dummy modal do such as does and did. These
forms are unlikely to be used as the only verb in
children’s early utterances as their function is to

modulate the meaning of the main verb rather than
to encode the central relational meaning of the sen-
tence.
An important reason why MOSAIC accounts for
the data is that it is biased towards producing sen-
tence final utterances. In English, non-finite utter-
ances can be learned from compound finite ques-
tions in which finiteness is marked on the auxiliary
rather than the lexical verb. A phrase like He walk
home can be learned from Did he walk home?, and
a phrase like That go there can be learned from
Does that go there? As MLU increases, the rela-
tive frequency of non-finite utterances in the out-
put decreases, because the model learns to produce
more and more of the compound finite utterances
from which these utterances have been learned.
MOSAIC therefore predicts that as the proportion
of non-finite utterances decreases, there will be a
complementary increase in the proportion of com-
pound finites.

6 Modelling optional infinitives in Dutch
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998703676470588">
Children acquiring Dutch seem to use a larger pro-
portion of non-finite verbs in finite contexts (e.g.,
hij lopen, bal trappen) than children learning Eng-
lish. Thus, in Dutch, a very high percentage of
children’s early utterances with verbs (about 80%)
are optional-infinitive errors. This percentage de-
creases to around 20% by MLU 3.5 (Wijnen,
Kempen &amp; Gillis, 2001).
As in English, optional infinitives in Dutch can
be learned from compound finites (auxiliary/modal
+ infinitive). However, an important difference
between English and Dutch is that in Dutch verb
position is dependent on finiteness. Thus, in the
simple finite utterance Hij drinkt koffie (He drinks
coffee) the finite verb form drinkt precedes its ob-
ject argument koffie whereas in the compound fi-
nite utterance Hij wil koffie drinken (He wants cof-
fee drink), the non-finite verb form drinken is re-
stricted to utterance final position and is hence pre-
ceded by its object argument: koffie. Interestingly,
children appear to be sensitive to this feature of
Dutch from very early in development and
MOSAIC is able to simulate this sensitivity. How-
ever, the fact that verb position is dependent on
finiteness in Dutch also means that whereas non-
finite verb forms are restricted to sentence final
position, finite verb forms tend to occur earlier in
the utterance. MOSAIC therefore simulates the
very high proportion of optional infinitives in early
child Dutch as a function of the interaction be-
tween its utterance final bias and increasing MLU.
That is, the high proportion of non-finites early on
is explained by the fact that the model mostly pro-
duces sentence-final phrases, which, as a result of

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940945945946">
Wexler (1994, 1998) argues that the optional-
infinitive stage does not occur in pro-drop lan-
guages, that is, languages like Spanish in which
verbs do not require an overt subject. Whether
MOSAIC can simulate the low frequency of op-
tional-infinitive errors in early child Spanish is
therefore of considerable theoretical interest, since
the ability of Wexler’s theory to explain cross-
linguistic data is presented as one of its main
strengths. Note that simulating the pattern of fi-
niteness marking in early child Spanish is not a
trivial task. This is because although optional-
infinitive errors are much less common in Spanish
than they are in Dutch, compound finites are actu-

the outcome of the simulations run using
MOSAIC. The parental corpus used as input con-
sisted of about 27,000 utterances. The model’s
production of optional infinitives drops from 21%
to 13% compared with 23% to 4% in the child.
Both the child and the model show a lower propor-
tion of optional-infinitive errors than in Dutch. The
presence of (some rare) optional-infinitive errors in
the model’s output is explained by the same
mechanism as in English and Dutch: a bias towards
learning the end of utterances. For example, the
input ¿Quieres beber café? (Do you want to drink
coffee?) may later lead to the production of beber
café. But why does the model produce so few op-
tional-infinitive errors in Spanish when the Spanish
input data contain so many compound finites? The
answer is that finite verb forms are much more
likely to occur in utterance final position in Span-
ish than they are in Dutch, which makes them
much easier to learn.

<abstract confidence="0.99975284375">Mainstream linguistic theory has traditionally assumed that children come into the world with rich innate knowledge about language and grammar. More recently, computational work using distributional algorithms has shown that the information contained in the input is much richer than proposed by the nativist approach. However, neither of these approaches has been developed to the point of providing detailed and quantitative predictions about the developmental data. In this paper, we champion a third approach, in which computational models learn from naturalistic input and produce utterances that can be directly compared with the utterances of languagelearning children. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by showing how MOSAIC, a simple distributional analyser, simulates the optional-infinitive phenomenon in English, Dutch, and Spanish. The model accounts for young children’s tendency to use both correct finites and incorrect (optional) infinitives in finite contexts, for the generality of this phenomenon across languages, and for the sparseness of other types of errors (e.g., word order errors). It thus shows how these phenomena, which have traditionally been taken as evidence for innate knowledge of Universal Grammar, can be explained in terms of a simple distributional analysis of the language to which children are exposed.</abstract>

Mainstream linguistic theory has addressed this ‘learnability problem’ by proposing the nativist hypothesis that children come into the world with rich innate knowledge about language and grammar (Chomsky, 1981; Piattelli-Palmarini, 2002; Pinker, 1984).

In particular, computer simulations have shown that a distributional analysis of the statistics of the input can provide a significant amount of syntactic information (Redington &amp; Chater, 1997). One limitation of the distributional approach is that analyses have rarely been done with naturalistic input (e.g. mothers’ child-directed speech) and have so far not been linked to the detailed analysis of a linguistic phenomenon found in human data, (e.g., Christiansen &amp; Chater, 2001). Indeed, neither the nativist nor the distributional approach has been developed to the point of providing detailed and quantitative predictions about the developmental dynamics of the acquisition of language. In order to remedy this weakness, our group has recently been exploring a different approach. This approach, which we think is a more powerful way of understanding how children acquire their native language, has involved developing a computational model (MOSAIC; Model Of Syntax Acquisition In Children) that learns from naturalistic input, and produces utterances that can be directly com</context>

This allows for a direct comparison of the output of the model at different stages with the children’s developmental data. The model learns from text-based input (i.e., it is assumed that the phonological stream has been segmented into words). Utterances are processed in a left to right fashion. MOSAIC uses two learning mechanisms, based on discrimination and generalisation, respectively. The first mechanism grows an n-ary discrimination network (Feigenbaum &amp; Simon, 1984; Gobet et al., 2001) consisting of nodes connected by test links. Nodes encode single words or phrases. Test links encode the difference between the contents of consecutive nodes. (Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the type of discrimination net used.) As the model sees more and more input, the number of nodes and links increases, and so does the amount of information held in the nodes, and, as a consequence, the average length of the phrases it can output. The node creation probability (NCP) is computed as follows: NCP = (N / M)L where M is a parameter arbitrarily set to 70,000 in the En</context>

This allows for a direct comparison of the output of the model at different stages with the children’s developmental data. The model learns from text-based input (i.e., it is assumed that the phonological stream has been segmented into words). Utterances are processed in a left to right fashion. MOSAIC uses two learning mechanisms, based on discrimination and generalisation, respectively. The first mechanism grows an n-ary discrimination network (Feigenbaum &amp; Simon, 1984; Gobet et al., 2001) consisting of nodes connected by test links. Nodes encode single words or phrases. Test links encode the difference between the contents of consecutive nodes. (Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the type of discrimination net used.) As the model sees more and more input, the number of nodes and links increases, and so does the amount of information held in the nodes, and, as a consequence, the average length of the phrases it can output. The node creation probability (NCP) is computed as follows: NCP = (N / M)L where M is a parameter arbitrarily set to 70,000 in the English and Spanish sim</context>

These data were taken from the Manchester corpus (Theakston, Lieven, Pine, &amp; Rowland, 2001), which is available in the CHILDES data base (MacWhinney, 2000). Recordings were made twice every three weeks over a period of one year and lasted for approximately one hour per session. Given that optional-infinitive phenomena are harder to identify in English than in languages such as Dutch or German (due to the relatively low number of unambiguous finite forms), the analysis focused on the subset of utterances that contain a verb with he, she, it, this (one), or that (one) as its subject. Restricting the analysis in this way avoids utterances such as I go, which could be classified both as non-finite and finite, and therefore makes it possible to more </context>

Indeed, neither the nativist nor the distributional approach has been developed to the point of providing detailed and quantitative predictions about the developmental dynamics of the acquisition of language.

The following analyses fill this gap. 5.1 Children’s data: Methods We selected the speech of two children (Anne, from 1 year 10 months to 2 years 9 months; and Becky, from 2 years to 2 years 11 months). These data were taken from the Manchester corpus (Theakston, Lieven, Pine, &amp; Rowland, 2001), which is available in the CHILDES data base (MacWhinney, 2000). Recordings were made twice every three weeks over a period of one year and lasted for approximately one hour per session. Given that optional-infinitive phenomena are harder to identify in English than in languages such as Dutch or German (due to the relatively low number of unambiguous finite forms), the analysis focused on the subset of utterances that contain a verb with he, she, it, this (one), or that (one) as its subject. Restricting the analysis in this way avoids utterances such as I go, which could be classified both a</context>

Whether MOSAIC can simulate the low frequency of optional-infinitive errors in early child Spanish is therefore of considerable theoretical interest, since the ability of Wexler’s theory to explain crosslinguistic data is presented as one of its main strengths. Note that simulating the pattern of finiteness marking in early child Spanish is not a trivial task. This is because although optionalinfinitive errors are much less commo</context>

When the model traverses test links only, the utterances it produces must have been present in the input. Where the model traverses generative links during output, novel utterances can be generated. An utterance is generated only if its final word was the final word in the utterance when it was encoded (this is accomplished by the use of an end marker). Thus, the model is biased towards generating utterances from sentence final position, which is consistent with empirical data from language-learning children (Naigles &amp; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998; Shady &amp; Gerken, 1999; Wijnen, Kempen, &amp; Gillis, 2001). 5 Modelling the optional-infinitive phenomenon in English Despite the theoretical interest of the optionalinfinitive phenomenon, there is, to our knowledge, no quantitative description of the developmental dynamics of the use of optional infinitives in English, with detail comparable to that provided in other languages, such as Dutch (Wijnen et al., 2001).
