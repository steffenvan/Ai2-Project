This paper presents a method to combine
a set of unsupervised algorithms that can
accurately disambiguate word senses in a
large, completely untagged corpus. Al-
though most of the techniques for word
sense resolution have been presented as
stand-alone, it is our belief that full-fledged
lexical ambiguity resolution should com-
bine several information sources and tech-
niques. The set of techniques have been
applied in a combined way to disambiguate
the genus terms of two machine-readable
dictionaries (MRD), enabling us to con-
struct complete taxonomies for Spanish
and French. Tested accuracy is above 80%
overall and 95% for two-way ambiguous
genus terms, showing that taxonomy build-
ing is not limited to structured dictionaries
such as LDOCE.

<bodyText confidence="0.999885153846154">
While in English the &amp;quot;lexical bottleneck&amp;quot; problem
(Briscoe, 1991) seems to be softened (e.g. WordNet
(Miller, 1990), Alvey Lexicon (Grover et al., 1993),
COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994), etc.) there are
no available wide range lexicons for natural language
processing (NLP) for other languages. Manual con-
struction of lexicons is the most reliable technique
for obtaining structured lexicons but is costly and
highly time-consuming. This is the reason for many
researchers having focused on the massive acquisi-
tion of lexical knowledge and semantic information
from pre-existing structured lexical resources as au-
tomatically as possible.

As dictionaries are special texts whose subject
matter is a language (or a pair of languages in the
case of bilingual dictionaries) they provide a wide
range of information about words by giving defini-
tions of senses of words, and, doing that, supplying
knowledge not just about language, but about the
world itself.
One of the most important relation to be ex-
tracted from machine-readable dictionaries (MRD)
is the hyponym/hypernym relation among dictio-
nary senses (e.g. (Amsler, 1981), (Vossen and Serail,
1990) ) not only because of its own importance as the
backbone of taxonomies, but also because this rela-
tion acts as the support of main inheritance mecha-
nisms helping, thus, the acquisition of other relations
and semantic features (Cohen and Loiselle, 1988),
providing formal structure and avoiding redundancy
in the lexicon (Briscoe et al., 1990). For instance,
following the natural chain of dictionary senses de-
scribed in the Diccionario General Ilustrado de la
Lengua Espanola (DGILE, 1987) we can discover
that a bonsai is a cultivated plant or bush.
bonsai_1_2 planta y arbusto asi cultivado.
(bonsai, plant and bush cultivated in that way)
The hyponym/hypernym relation appears be-
tween the entry word (e.g. bonsai) and the genus
term, or the core of the phrase (e.g. planta and
arbusto). Thus, usually a dictionary definition is
written to employ a genus term combined with dif-
ferentia which distinguishes the word being defined
from other words with the same genus term&apos;.
As lexical ambiguity pervades language in texts,
the words used in dictionary are themselves lexically
ambiguous. Thus, when constructing complete dis-
ambiguated taxonomies, the correct dictionary sense
of the genus term must be selected in each dictionary
&apos;For other kind of definition patterns not based on
genus, a genus-like term was added after studying those
patterns.

Sense Disambiguation (WSD)2. In the previous ex-
ample planta has thirteen senses and arbusto only
one.
Although a large set of dictionaries have been ex-
ploited as lexical resources, the most widely used
monolingual MRD for NLP is LDOCE which was
designed for learners of English. It is clear that dif-
ferent dictionaries do not contain the same explicit
information. The information placed in LDOCE has
allowed to extract other implicit information easily,
e.g. taxonomies (Bruce et al., 1992). Does it mean
that only highly structured dictionaries like LDOCE
are suitable to be exploited to provide lexical re-
sources for NLP systems?
We explored this question probing two disparate
dictionaries: Diccionario General Ilustrado de la
Lengua Espanola (DGILE, 1987) for Spanish, and
Le Plus Petit Larousse (LPPL, 1980) for French.
Both are substantially poorer in coded information
than LDOCE (LDOCE, 1987)3. These dictionaries
are very different in number of headwords, polysemy
degree, size and length of definitions (c.f. table 1).
While DGILE is a good example of a large sized
dictionary, LPPL shows to what extent the smallest
dictionary is useful.
Even if most of the techniques for WSD are pre-
sented as stand-alone, it is our belief, following the
ideas of (McRoy, 1992), that full-fledged lexical am-
biguity resolution should combine several informa-
tion sources and techniques. This work does not ad-
dress all the heuristics cited in her paper, but prof-
its from techniques that were at hand, without any
claim of them being complete. In fact we use unsu-
pervised techniques, i.e. those that do not require
hand-coding of any kind, that draw knowledge from
a variety of sources — the source dictionaries, bilin-
gual dictionaries and WordNet — in diverse ways.

This paper tries to proof that using an appropriate
method to combine those heuristics we can disam-

2 Heuristics for Genus Sense
Disambiguation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934368421053">
As the methods described in this paper have been
developed for being applied in a combined way, each
one must be seen as a container of some part of the
knowledge (or heuristic) needed to disambiguate the
correct hypernym sense. Not all the heuristics are
suitable to be applied to all definitions. For combin-
ing the heuristics, each heuristic assigns each candi-
date hypernym sense a normalized weight, i.e. a real
number ranging from 0 to 1 (after a scaling process,
where maximum score is assigned 1, c.f. section 2.9).
The heuristics applied range from the simplest (e.g.
heuristic 1, 2, 3 and 4) to the most informed ones
(e.g. heuristics 5, 6, 7 and 8), and use information
present in the entries under study (e.g. heuristics 1,
2, 3 and 4) or extracted from the whole dictionary as
a unique lexical knowledge resource (e.g. heuristics
5 and 6) or combining lexical knowledge from sev-
eral heterogeneous lexical resources (e.g. heuristic 7
and 8).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.957854">
2.1 Heuristic 1: Monosemous Genus Term
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990881666666667">
This heuristic is applied when the genus term is
monosemous. As there is only one hypernym sense
candidate, the hyponym sense is attached to it. Only
12% of noun dictionary senses have monosernous
genus terms in DGILE, whereas the smaller LPPL
reaches 40%.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981208">
2.2 Heuristic 2: Entry Sense Ordering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999480428571429">
This heuristic assumes that senses are ordered in an
entry by frequency of usage. That is, the most used
and important senses are placed in the entry before
less frequent or less important ones. This heuristic
provides the maximum score to the first sense of the
hypernym candidates and decreasing scores to the
others.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.934936">
2.3 Heuristic 3: Explicit Semantic Domain
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999560857142857">
This heuristic assigns the maximum score to the hy-
pernym sense which has the same semantic domain
tag as the hyponym. This heuristic is of limited ap-
plication: LPPL lacks semantic tags, and less than
10% of the definitions in DGILE are marked with
one of the 96 different semantic domain tags (e.g.
med. for medicine, or der. for law, etc.).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.962757">
2.4 Heuristic 4: Word Matching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922909090909">
This heuristic trusts that related concepts will be
expressed using the same content words. Given
two definitions — that of the hyponym and that of
one candidate hypernym — this heuristic computes
the total amount of content words shared (including
headwords). Due to the morphological productivity
of Spanish and French, we have considered differ-
ent variants of this heuristic. For LPPL the match
among lemmas proved most useful, while DGILE
yielded better results when matching the first four
characters of words.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.890662">
2.5 Heuristic 5: Simple Cooccurrence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942666666667">
This heuristic uses cooccurrence data collected from
the whole dictionary (see section 4.1 for more de-
tails). Thus, given a hyponym definition (0) and a
set of candidate hypernym definitions, this method
selects the candidate hypernym definition (E) which
returns the maximum score given by formula (1):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9937435">
SC(0, E) = E cw(wi,..7) (1)
w,E0Aw3EE
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999736222222222">
The cooccurrence weight (cw) between two words
can be given by Cooccurrence Frequency, Mutual
Information (Church and Hanks, 1990) or Associ-
ation Ratio (Resnik, 1992). We tested them us-
ing different context window sizes. Best results were
obtained in both dictionaries using the Association
Ratio. In DGILE window size 7 proved the most
suitable, whereas in LPPL whole definitions were
used.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961342">
2.6 Heuristic 6: Cooccurrence Vectors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955857142857">
This heuristic is based on the method presented in
(Wilks et al., 1993) which also uses cooccurrence
data collected from the whole dictionary (c.f. sec-
tion 4.1). Given a hyponym definition (0) and a set
of candidate hypernym definitions, this method se-
lects the candidate hypernym (E) which returns the
maximum score following formula (2):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.941508">
CV (0, E) = sim(V0,VE) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996259333333333">
The similarity (sim) between two definitions can
be measured by the dot product, the cosine function
or the Euclidean distance between two vectors (Vo
and VE) which represent the contexts of the words
presented in the respective definitions following for-
mula (3):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.7749975">
VD e f =- E civ(w)
w‘EDef
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998953">
The vector for a definition (VDef ) is computed
adding the cooccurrence information vectors of the
words in the definition (civ(wi)). The cooccur-
rence information vector for a word is collected from
the whole dictionary using Cooccurrence Frequency,
Mutual Information or Association Ratio. The best
combination for each dictionary vary: whereas the
dot product, Association Ratio, and window size 7
proved best for DGILE, the cosine, Mutual Informa-
tion and whole definitions were preferred for LPPL.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.884061">
2.7 Heuristic 7: Semantic Vectors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997832416666667">
Because both LPPL and DGILE are poorly seman-
tically coded we decided to enrich the dictionary as-
signing automatically a semantic tag to each dictio-
nary sense (see section 4.2 for more details). Instead
of assigning only one tag we can attach to each dic-
tionary sense a vector with weights for each of the
25 semantic tags we considered (which correspond
to the 25 lexicographer files of WordNet (Miller,
1990)). In this case, given an hyponym (0) and a
set of possible hypernyms we select the candidate hy-
pernym (E) which yields maximum similarity among
semantic vectors:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.542662">
SV (0 , E) = sim(Vo , VE) (4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999845">
where sim can be the dot product, cosine or Eu-
clidean Distance, as before. Each dictionary sense
has been semantically tagged with a vector of se-
mantic weights following formula (5).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.988065">
VDef = SWV(Wi) (5)
wiEDef
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999366">
The salient word vector (swv) for a word contains
a saliency weight (Yarowsky, 1992) for each of the 2:5
semantic tags of WordNet. Again, the best method
differs from one dictionary to the other: each one
prefers the method used in the previous section.

2.8 Heuristic 8: Conceptual Distance

closeness in meaning among words, taking as refer-
ence a structured hierarchical net. Conceptual dis-

of the shortest path that connects the concepts in
the hierarchy. In order to apply conceptual distance,
WordNet was chosen as the hierarchical knowledge
base, and bilingual dictionaries were used to link
Spanish and French words to the English concepts.
Given a hyponym definition (0) and a set of candi-
date hypernym definitions, this heuristic chooses the
hypernym definition (E) which is closest according
to the following formula:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.978105">
C D(0 , E) =- dist(headwordo , genus E) (6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999181">
That is, Conceptual Distance is measured between
the headword of the hyponym definition and the
genus of the candidate hypernym definitions using
formula (7), c.f. (Agirre et al., 1994). To compute
the distance between any two words (wi ,w2), all the
corresponding concepts in WordNet (c1, c23) are
searched via a bilingual dictionary, and the mini-
mum of the summatory for each concept in the path
between each possible combination of cl, and c23 is
returned, as shown below:

<bodyText confidence="0.995953">
Formulas (6) and (7) proved the most suitable
of several other possibilities for this task, includ-
ing those which included full definitions in (6) or
those using other Conceptual Distance formulas, c.f.
(Agirre and Rigau, 1996).

2.9 Combining the heuristics: Summing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999626333333333">
As outlined in the beginning of this section, the way
to combine all the heuristics in one single decision
is simple. The weights each heuristic assigns to the
rivaling senses of one genus are normalized to the
interval between 1 (best weight) and 0. Formula (8)
shows the normalized value a given heuristic will give
to sense E of the genus, according to the weight as-
signed to the heuristic to sense E and the maximum
weight of all the sense of the genus E.

added up for each competing sense. The order in
which the heuristics are applied has no relevance at
all.

In order to test the performance of each heuristic and
their combination, we selected two test sets at ran-
dom (one per dictionary): 391 noun senses for DG-
ILE and 115 noun senses for LPPL, which give confi-
dence rates of 95% and 91% respectively. From these
samples, we retained only those for which the au-
tomatic selection process selected the correct genus
(more than 97% in both dictionaries). Both test sets
were disambiguated by hand. Where necessary mul-
tiple correct senses were allowed in both dictionaries.

3.2 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934642857143">
Table 3 summarizes the results for polysemous
genus.
In general, the results obtained for each heuristic
seem to be poor, but always over the random choice
baseline (also shown in tables 3 and 4). The best
heuristics according to the recall in both dictionaries
is the sense ordering heuristic (2). For the rest, the
difference in size of the dictionaries could explain the
reason why cooccurrence-based heuristics (5 and 6)
are the best for DGILE, and the worst for LPPL.
Semantic distance gives the best precision for LPPL,
but chooses an average of 1.25 senses for each genus.
With the combination of the heuristics (Sum)
we obtained an improvement over sense ordering
(heuristic 2) of 9% (from 70% to 79%) in DGILE,
and of 7% (from 66% to 73%) in LPPL, maintaining
in both cases a coverage of 100%. Including monose-
mous genus in the results (c.f. table 4), the sum
is able to correctly disambiguate 83% of the genus
in DGILE (8% improvement over sense ordering)
and 82% of the genus in LPPL (4% improvement).
Note that we are adding the results of eight different
heuristics with eight different performances, improv-
ing the individual performance of each one.
In order to test the contribution of each heuris-
tic to the total knowledge, we tested the sum of all
the heuristics, eliminating one of them in turn. The

(Gale et al., 1993) estimate that any sense-
identification system that does not give the cor-
rect sense of polysemous words more than 75% of
the time would not be worth serious consideration.
As table 5 shows this is not the case in our sys-
tem. For instance, in DGILE heuristic 8 has the
worst performance (see table 4, precision 57%), but
it has the second larger contribution (see table 5,
precision decreases from 83% to 77%). That is,
even those heuristics with poor performance can con-

The difference in performance between the two dic-
tionaries show that quality and size of resources is
a key issue. Apparently the task of disambiguating
LPPL seems easier: less polysemy, more monose-
mous genus and high precision of the sense order-
ing heuristic. However, the heuristics that depend
only on the size of the data (5, 6) perform poorly on
LPPL, while they are powerful methods for DGILE.
The results show that the combination of heuris-
tics is useful, even if the performance of some of the
heuristics is low. The combination performs better
than isolated heuristics, and allows to disambiguate
all the genus of the test set with a success rate of
83% in DGILE and 82% in LPPL.
All the heuristics except heuristic 3 can readily be
applied to any other dictionary. Minimal parameter
adjustment (window size, cooccurrence weigth for-
mula and vector similarity function) should be done
to fit the characteristics of the dictionary, but ac-
cording to our results it does not alter significantly
the results after combining the heuristics.

Heuristics 7 and 8 need external knowledge, not
present in the dictionaries themselves. This knowl-
edge is composed of semantic field tags and hier-
archical structures, and both were extracted from
WordNet. In order to do this, the gap between our
working languages and English was filled with two
bilingual dictionaries. For this purpose, we derived
a list of links for each word in Spanish and French
as follows.
Firstly, each Spanish or French word was looked
up in the bilingual dictionary, and its English trans-
lation was found. For each translation WordNet
yielded its senses, in the form of WordNet concepts
(synsets). The pair made of the original word and
each of the concepts linked to it, was included in a
file, thus producing a MTD with links between Span-
ish or French words and WordNet concepts. Obvi-
ously some of this links are not correct, as the trans-
lation in the bilingual dictionary may not necessarily
be understood in its senses (as listed in WordNet).
The heuristics using these MTDs are aware of this.
For instance when accessing the semantic fields
for yin (French) we get a unique translation, wine,
which has two senses in WordNet: &lt;wine , vino&gt;
as a beverage, and &lt;wine , wine-coloured&gt; as
a kind of color. In this example two links
would be produced (yin, &lt;wine , vino&gt;) and
(yin, &lt;wine, wine-coloured&gt;). This link allows
us to get two possible semantic fields for yin
(noun.food, file 13, and noun.attribute, file 7)
and the whole structure of the hierarchy in Word-
Net for each of the concepts.

5 Comparison with Previous Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990891648148148">
Several approaches have been proposed for attaching
the correct sense (from a set of prescribed ones) of a
word in context. Some of them have been fully tested
in real size texts (e.g. statistical methods (Yarowsky,
1992), (Yarowsky, 1994), (Miller and Teibel, 1991),
knowledge based methods (Sussna, 1993), (Agirre
and Rigau, 1996), or mixed methods (Richardson
et al., 1994), (Resnik, 1995)). The performance
of WSD is reaching a high stance, although usually
only small sets of words with clear sense distinctions
are selected for disambiguation (e.g. (Yarowsky,
1995) reports a success rate of 96% disambiguating
twelve words with two clear sense distinctions each
one).
This paper has presented a general technique
for WSD which is a combination of statistical and
knowledge based methods, and which has been ap-
plied to disambiguate all the genus terms in two dic-
tionaries.
Although this latter task could be seen easier than
general WSD4, genus are usually frequent and gen-
eral words with high ambiguity5. While the average
of senses per noun in DGILE is 1.8 the average of
senses per noun genus is 2.75 (1.30 and 2.29 respec-
tively for LPPL). Furthermore, it is not possible to
apply the powerful &amp;quot;one sense per discourse&amp;quot; prop-
erty (Yarowsky, 1995) because there is no discourse
in dictionaries.
WSD is a very difficult task even for humans6,
but semiautomatic techniques to disambiguate genus
have been broadly used (Amsler, 1981) (Vossen and
Serail, 1990) (Ageno et al., 1992) (Artola, 1993)
and some attempts to do automatic genus disam-
biguation have been performed using the semantic
codes of the dictionary (Bruce et al., 1992) or us-
ing cooccurrence data extracted from the dictionary
itself (Wilks et al., 1993).
Selecting the correct sense for LDOCE genus
terms, (Bruce et al., 1992)) report a success rate
of 80% (90% after hand coding of ten genus). This
impressive rate is achieved using the intrinsic char-
4In contrast to other sense distinctions Dictionary
word senses frequently differ in subtle distinctions (only
some of which have to do with meaning (Gale et al.,
1993)) producing a large set of closely related dictionary
senses (Jacobs, 1991).
5However, in dictionary definitions the headword and
the genus term have to be the same part of speech.
6(Wilks et al., 1993) disambiguating 197 occurrences
of the word bank in LDOCE say &amp;quot;was not an easy task,
as some of the usages of bank did not seem to fit any
of the definitions very well&amp;quot;. Also (Miller et al., 1994)
tagging semantically SemCor by hand, measure an error
rate around 10% for polysemous words.

acteristics of LDOCE. Furthermore, using only the
implicit information contained into the dictionary
definitions of LDOCE (Cowie et al., 1992) report
a success rate of 47% at a sense level. (Wilks et
al., 1993) reports a success rate of 45% disambiguat-
ing the word bank (thirteen senses LDOCE) using a
technique similar to heuristic 6. In our case, combin-
ing informed heuristics and without explicit seman-
tic tags, the success rates are 83% and 82% over-
all, and 95% and 75% for two-way ambiguous genus
(DGILE and LPPL data, respectively). Moreover,
93% and 92% of times the real solution is between
the first and second proposed solution.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970829268293">
The results show that computer aided construction
of taxonomies using lexical resources is not limited
to highly-structured dictionaries as LDOCE, but has
been succesfully achieved with two very different dic-
tionaries. All the heuristics used are unsupervised,
in the sense that they do not need hand-codding of
any kind, and the proposed method can be adapted
to any dictionary with minimal parameter setting.
Nevertheless, quality and size of the lexical knowl-
edge resources are important. As the results for
LPPL show, small dictionaries with short definitions
can not profit from raw corpus techniques (heuristics
5, 6), and consequently the improvement of preci-
sion over the random baseline or first-sense heuristic
is lower than in DGILE.
We have also shown that such a simple technique
as just summing is a useful way to combine knowl-
edge from several unsupervised WSD methods, al-
lowing to raise the performance of each one in isola-
tion (coverage and/or precision). Furthermore, even
those heuristics with apparently poor results provide
knowledge to the final result not provided by the rest
of heuristics. Thus, adding new heuristics with dif-
ferent methodologies and different knowledge (e.g.
from corpora) as they become available will certainly
improve the results.
Needless to say, several improvements can be
done both in individual heuristic and also in the
method to combine them. For instance, the cooccur-
rence heuristics have been applied quite indiscrim-
inately, even in low frequency conditions. Signifi-
cance tests or association coefficients could be used
in order to discard low confidence decisions. Also,
instead of just summing, more clever combinations
can be tried, such as training classifiers which use
the heuristics as predictor variables.
Although we used these techniques for genus dis-
ambiguation we expect similar results (or even bet-
ter taken the &amp;quot;one sense per discourse&amp;quot; property
and lexical knowledge acquired from corpora) for the
WSD problem.

Although most of the techniques for word sense resolution have been presented as stand-alone, it is our belief that full-fledged lexical ambiguity resolution should combine several information sources and techniques. The set of techniques have been applied in a combined way to disambiguate the genus terms of two machine-readable dictionaries (MRD), enabling us to construct complete taxonomies for Spanish and French. Tested accuracy is above 80% overall and 95% for two-way ambiguous genus terms, showing that taxonomy building is not limited to structured dictionaries such as LDOCE.</abstract>

As dictionaries are special texts whose subject matter is a language (or a pair of languages in the case of bilingual dictionaries) they provide a wide range of information about words by giving definitions of senses of words, and, doing that, supplying knowledge not just about language, but about the world itself. One of the most important relation to be extracted from machine-readable dictionaries (MRD) is the hyponym/hypernym relation among dictionary senses (e.g. (Amsler, 1981), (Vossen and Serail, 1990) ) not only because of its own importance as the backbone of taxonomies, but also because this relation acts as the support of main inheritance mechanisms helping, thus, the acquisition of other relations and semantic features (Cohen and Loiselle, 1988), providing formal structure and avoiding redundancy in the lexicon (Briscoe et al., 1990).

It is clear that different dictionaries do not contain the same explicit information. The information placed in LDOCE has allowed to extract other implicit information easily, e.g. taxonomies (Bruce et al., 1992). Does it mean that only highly structured dictionaries like LDOCE are suitable to be exploited to provide lexical resources for NLP systems? We explored this question probing two disparate dictionaries: Diccionario General Ilustrado de la Lengua Espanola (DGILE, 1987) for Spanish, and Le Plus Petit Larousse (LPPL, 1980) for French.

The set of techniques have been applied in a combined way to disambiguate the genus terms of two machine-readable dictionaries (MRD), enabling us to construct complete taxonomies for Spanish and French. Tested accuracy is above 80% overall and 95% for two-way ambiguous genus terms, showing that taxonomy building is not limited to structured dictionaries such as LDOCE. 1 Introduction While in English the &amp;quot;lexical bottleneck&amp;quot; problem (Briscoe, 1991) seems to be softened (e.g. WordNet (Miller, 1990), Alvey Lexicon (Grover et al., 1993), COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994), etc.) there are no available wide range lexicons for natural language processing (NLP) for other languages. Manual construction of lexicons is the most reliable technique for obtaining structured lexicons but is costly and highly time-consuming. This is the reason for many researchers having focused on the massive acquisition of lexical knowledge and semantic information from pre-existing structured lexical resources as automatically as possible. *This research has been partially funded by CICYT TIC96-1243-0O3-02 (ITEM proj</context>

Instead of assigning only one tag we can attach to each dictionary sense a vector with weights for each of the 25 semantic tags we considered (which correspond to the 25 lexicographer files of WordNet (Miller, 1990)). In this case, given an hyponym (0) and a set of possible hypernyms we select the candidate hypernym (E) which yields maximum similarity among semantic vectors: SV (0 , E) = sim(Vo , VE) (4) where sim can be the dot product, cosine or Euclidean Distance, as before. Each dictionary sense has been semantically tagged with a vector of semantic weights following formula (5). VDef = SWV(Wi) (5) wiEDef The salient word vector (swv) for a word contains a saliency weight (Yarowsky, 1992) for each of the 2:5 semantic tags of WordNet.
