We examine three different types of sense
clustering criteria with an Information
Retrieval application in mind: methods
based on the wordnet structure (such
as generalization, cousins, sisters...); co-
occurrence of senses obtained from Sem-
cor; and equivalent translations of senses
in other languages via the EuroWordNet
InterLingual Index (ILI). We conclude
that a) different NLP applications de-
mand not only different sense granulari-
ties but different (possibly overlapped)
sense clusterings. b) co-occurrence of
senses in Semcor provide strong evidence
for Information Retrieval clusters, un-
like methods based on wordnet structure
and systematic polysemy. c) parallel pol-
ysemy in three or more languages via
the ILI, besides providing sense clusters
for MT and CLIR, is strongly correlated
with co-occurring senses in Semcor, and
thus can be useful for Information Re-
trieval as well.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99990352">
WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and EuroWordNet
(Vossen, 1998), as most large-coverage electronic
dictionaries and semantic networks, are not de-
signed for a specific Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) application. It is commonly assumed
that sense distinctions in these lexical databases
are too fine-grained for a majority of applications.
In particular, we have used EuroWordNet in a
Cross-Language Text Retrieval (CLTR) applica-
tion (Verdejo et al., 2000) and a number of CLTR
experiments (Gonzalo et al., 1999; Vossen et al.,
1999), confirming that it is crucial to apply certain
sense clusters to Wordnet (WN) and EuroWord-
Net (EWN) to take real advantage of them in
Information Retrieval applications. Potentially,
a semantic network such as WN/EWN can help
distinguishing different word senses for retrieval,
enhancing precision, and identifying synonymic
or conceptually related terms, enhancing recall.
But not all sense distinctions in a lexical database
are meaningful for Information Retrieval. For in-
stance, the following sense distinctions are super-
fluous in an information retrieval application, as
the different senses do not lead to different topics
or different kinds of documents:

But sense clustering have been generally as-
sociated with identifying Systematic Polysemy
rules, taking into account lexicographic arguments
rather than potential applications. In (Peters et
al., 1998; Peters and Peters, 2000) the EuroWord-
Net structure, together with systematic polysemy,
is used to group senses (sisters, auto-hyponymy,
cousins, twins). This work is linked to the find-
ing of systematic polysemy classes in (Buitelaar,
1998; Buitelaar, 2000; Tomuro, 1998) and others.
While identifying systematic polysemy might be
a key issue for and adequate leadco-semantic spec-

ification, systematic relatedness does not always
mean sense proximity. In particular, such rules
do not necessarily predict a similar behavior of
the clustered senses in an NLP application. For in-
stance, the animal/food systematic polysemy does
not lead to good sense clusters neither for Machine
Translation between English and Spanish, nor for
Information Retrieval. In Spanish it is common
to give different names to an animal in a zoological
sense or in a food sense. For instance, it is nec-
essary to distinguish animal/food senses of fish in
order to translate into pez or peseta°, depending
on the context. And for Information Retrieval,
the animal sense will appear in documents about,
say, zoology, while the food sense will appear in
documents about cooking. Therefore, while the
animal/food rule is useful for lexical representa-
tion and prediction of sense extensions in English,
it cannot be used to cluster senses in MT or M.
In (Vossen et al., 1999) we performed a concept-
based IR experiment where using the ILI with
clusters was slightly worse than using the ILI with-
out the clusters. While clustering the EWN Inter-
lingual Index records on the basis of systematic
polysemy proved useful to provide better inter-
languages connectivity in the EWN database, this
result supports the idea that systematic polysemy,
per se, is not an indication of potential IR clusters.
However, we do not claim that all systematic
polysemy patterns are useless for IR. It is prob-
ably reasonable to classify different systematic
polysemy rules according to whether they pro-
duce M clusters or not. Some, already identi-
fied, patterns of regular polysemy, such as con-
tainer/quantity or music/dance (Peters and Pe-
ters, 2000) yield adequate IR clusters. Other
patterns, such as animal/food, plant/food, ani-
mal/skin, language/people tend to produce clus-
ters that are not valid for IR. This classification
of polysemy patterns is, to our opinion, strongly
related with the black and white dot operators in-
troduced in (Buitelaar, 1998). The black operator
was reserved for polysemy patterns including sets
of senses that may co-occur in the same word in-
stance (e.g. book as written work or as physical
object), and white operator is reserved for poly-
semy patterns for senses that never co-occur in
the same word instance (e.g. window as physi-
cal object or as computer frame). Unfortunately,
the distinction between black and white operators
classes has not been applied yet -to our knowl-
edge - to the set of polysemous classes defined in
Buitelaar&apos;s thesis.
But, in many cases, even useful polysemy
rules fail to extract pairs of systematically re-
lated senses in WN/EWN, because the hypemym
branches that they pertain to do not obey none of
the described systematic polysemy classes/types.
Take the following example:
sack:
I. The act of terminating someone&apos;s employment
TERMINATION, END, CONCLUSION
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986939416666667">
2. a bag made of paper or plastic for holding
customer purchases -4 BAG
3. unwaisted loose-fitting dress hanging straight
from the shoulders -+ DRESS, FROCK
4. hanging bed of canvas or rope netting -+ BED
5. a woman&apos;s full loose hip-length jacket -*
JACKET
6. dry white wine from SW Europe -4 WHITE
WINE
7. quantity contained in a sack -4 CONTAINER-
FUL
8. pocket. -4 ENCLOSED SPACE
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.972170272727273">
sack 2 (bag of paper for customer&apos;s pur-
chases) and sack 7 (quantity contained in a
sack) are related by systematic polysemy as con-
tainer/containerful. Similarly, sack 8 (pocket)
should be related to some sense with the mean-
ing of quantity. Nevertheless, sack 8, whose hy-
pemym is &amp;quot;enclosed space&amp;quot;, cannot be retained in
the same way that the former pair of senses, in
spite of identical semantic relationship. System-
atic polysemy cannot predict, as well, a poten-
tial IR cluster with senses 3 and 5 (both meaning
types of clothing and thus likely to appear in sim-
ilar contexts). Senses 3 and 5 indicate, also, that
clustering might also depend on the application
domain: they can be clustered in a generic search,
but they should be distinguished if the search is
performed in a clothing domain.
It is interesting to note, finally, that different
clustering criteria not only lead to different gran-
ularities, but they can produce tangled clusters,
as in
Onion:

The plant/food rule successfully relates senses
2 and 1, while for Information Retrieval the inter-
esting cluster is for senses 2 and 3, (both botanical

Our hypothesis is, therefore, that we cannot as-
sume general clustering criteria; different NLP ap-
plications require different clustering criteria that
are difficult to reconcile in a single clustering ap-
proach. Our work on clustering is centered on
identifying sense-distinctions that could be rel-
evant from an Information Retrieval and Cross
Language Information Retrieval point of view.
Next section describes a clustering strategy that
adequates to the Information Retrieval criterion:
cluster senses if they tend to co-occur in the same
Semcor documents.
In Section 3, we study a different clustering cri-
terion, based on equivalent translations for two
or more senses in other wordnets from the Eu-
roWordNet database. This is a direct criterion
to cluster senses in Machine Translation or Cross-
Language Text Retrieval. Then we measure the
overlap between both criteria, to conclude that the
EWN InterLingual Index is also a valuable source
of evidence for Information Retrieval clusters.

2 Cluster evidence from Semcor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987751">
One of our goals within the EuroWordNet and
ITEM projects was to provide sense clusterings
for WordNet (and, in general,for the EuroWord-
Net InterLingual Index, (Gonzalo et al., 1999)
that leave only the sense distinctions in wordnets
that indicate different (semantic) indexing units
for Information Retrieval. Our first lexicographic
examination of WordNet sense distinctions and
clusterings following criteria based on the wordnet
hierarchy did not produce clear criteria to classify
senses semi-automatically according to this IR re-
quirement. As we mentioned before, the clusters
applied on the EWN InterLingual Index which re-
lied solely on hierarchical information in Word-
net, produced a slight decrease of retrieval per-
formance in an experiment using ILI records as
indexing units.
Thus, we decided to stick to our only clear-cut
criterion: cluster senses if they are likely to co-
occur in the same document. The fact that the
same sense combination occurs in several seman-
tically tagged documents should provide strong
evidence for clustering. Fortunately, we had the
Semcor corpus of semantically-tagged documents
to start with.
For example, the first two senses of &amp;quot;breath&amp;quot;
co-occur in several Semcor documents:
Breath
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999481333333333">
1. (the air that is inhaled or exhaled in respira-
tion)
2. (the act of exhaling)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988987268292683">
This co-occurrence indicates that this sense dis-
tinction will not help to discriminate different doc-
ument contexts. While in this particular exam-
ple there is a clear relation between senses (sense
1 is involved in the action specified in sense 2),
it seems extremely difficult to find general clus-
tering techniques based on WordNet hierarchy to
capture all potential IR clusters.
We have scanned Semcor in search of sets of
(two or more) senses that co-occur frequently
enough. In practice, we started with a thresh-
old of at least 2 documents (out of 171) with
the co-occurring senses in a similar distribution.
We did not use the original Semcor files, but the
IR-Semcor partition (Gonzalo et al., 1998) that
splits multi-text documents into coherent retrieval
chunks. We completed this list of candidates to
cluster with pairs of senses that only co-occur once
but belong to any &amp;quot;cousin&amp;quot; combination (Peters et
al., 1998). Finally, we obtained 507 sets of sense
combinations (producing above 650 sense pairs)
for which Semcor provides positive evidence for
clustering. A manual verification of 50 of such
clusters showed that above 70% of them were use-
ful. We also noticed that raising the threshold
(the number of documents in which the senses co-
occur), the error rate decreases quickly.
Then we worked with this set of positive IR clus-
ters, trying to identify a set of common features
that could be used to cluster the rest of WN/EWN
senses. However, it seems extremely difficult to
find any single criterion, common to all clusters.
For instance, if we consider a) number of vari-
ants in common between the synsets correspond-
ing to the candidate senses; b) number of words
in common between the glosses; and c) common
hypemyms, we find that any combination of val-
ues for these three features is likely to be found
among the set of clusters inferred from Semcor.
For example:

The next logical step is to use this positive ev-
idence, combined with negative co-occurrence ev-
idence, in training some machine learning system
that can successfully capture the regularities hid-
den to our manual inspection. In principle, a bi-
nary classification task would be easy to capture
by decision trees or similar techniques.
Therefore, we have also extracted from Sem-
cor combinations of senses that appear frequently
enough in Semcor, but never appear together in
the same document. The threshold was set in,
at least, 8 occurrences of each sense in Semcor,
resulting in more than 500 negative clusters. A
manual verification of 50 of these negative clusters
showed that about 80% of them were acceptable
for Information Retrieval as senses that should
be distinguished. Together with the positive evi-
dence, we have more than 1100 training cases for
a binary classifier. Our plan is to apply this clas-
sifier to the whole EWN InterLingual Index, and
then perform precision/recall tests in the environ-
ment described in (Gonzalo et al., 1998; Gonzalo
et al., 1999).

3 Cluster evidence from the ILI
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999772953488372">
When translated into a target language, sense dis-
tinctions of a word may be lexicalind. For in-
stance, the English term spring is translated into
Spanish as primavem in its &amp;quot;season&amp;quot; sense, into
muelle in its &amp;quot;metal device&amp;quot; sense, or as fuente
in its &amp;quot;fountain&amp;quot; sense. For an English-Spanish
Machine Translation system, it is crucial to dis-
tinguish these three senses of spring. But it is
also frequent that two or more senses of a word
are translated into the same word, for one or more
languages. For instance, child as &amp;quot;human offspring
(son or daughter) of any age&amp;quot; and child as &amp;quot;young
male person&amp;quot; are both translated into &amp;quot;ninon in
Spanish, into &amp;quot;enfant&amp;quot; in French, and into &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot;
in German. We will use the term &amp;quot;parallel poly--
semy&amp;quot; to refer to this situation in the rest of this
article.
Obviously, a Machine Translation system does
not need to distinguish these two senses. But it is
also tempting to hypothesize that the existence of
parallel polysemy in two or more target languages
may indicate that the two senses are close enough
to be clustered in more applications. Indeed, in
(Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999) this criterion is pro-
posed to determine which word senses should be
retained or discarded in a testbed for automatic
Word Sense Disambiguation systems.
In particular, our goal has been to test whether
two or more senses of a word are likely to be clus-
tered, for IR purposes, if they have parallel pol-
ysemy in a certain number of languages via the
EuroWordNet InterLingual Index. If the answer
is positive, then the InterLingual Index, with eight
languages interconnected, would be a rich source
of information to provide IR clusters. In EWN,
each monolingual database is linked, via Cross-
Language equivalence relations, to the InterLin-
gual Index (11I) which is the superset of all con-
cepts occurring in all languages. The ILI permits
finding equivalent synsets between any pair of lan-
guages included in the database. For instance,
senses 1 and 2 of child are translated into Span-
ish, French and German as follows:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.448886">
Child

<bodyText confidence="0.518566625">
child 1 {child, kid} — (a human offspring (son

&amp;quot;they were able to send their kids to college&amp;quot;)
child 2 {male child, boy, child} — (a young
male person; &amp;quot;the baby was a boy&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;she made the
boy brush his teeth every night&amp;quot;)

Note that child 1 and child 2 have parallel trans-
lations in all three languages: Spanish (niiio),
French (enfant) and German (kind). In this case,
this criterion successfully detects a pair of senses
that could be clustered for Information Retrieval
purposes.
In order to test the general validity of this cri-
terion, we have followed these steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.823498194444445">
• Select a set of nouns for a full manual study.
We have chosen the set of 22 nouns used
in the first SENSEVAL competition (Kilgar-
riff and Palmer, 2000). This set satisfied
our requirements of size (small enough for an
exhaustive manual revision), reasonable de-
gree of polysemy, and unbiased for our test-
ing purposes (the criteria to select these 22
nouns was obviously independent of our ex-
periment). We had to reduce the original
set to 20 nouns (corresponding to 73 EWN
senses), as the other two nouns were polyse-
mous in the Hector database used for SEN-
SEVAL, but monosemous in WordNet 1.5 and
EuroWordNet. As target languages we chose
Spanish, French, Dutch and German.
• Extract the candidate senses that satisfy the
parallel polysemy criterion, in three variants:
— Experiment 1: sets of senses that have
parallel translations in at least two out
of the four target languages.
— Experiment 2: sets of senses that have
parallel translations in at least one out
of the four target languages. This is a
softer constraint that produces a super-
set of the sense clusters obtained in Ex-
periment 1.
— Experiment 3: sets of senses whose
synsets are mapped into the same target
synset for at least one of the target lan-
guages. This criterion cannot be tested
on plain multilingual dictionaries, only
on EWN-like semantic databases.
• Check out manually whether the clusters pro-
duced in Experiments 1-3 are valid for Infor-
mation Retrieval. At this step, the validity of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.966462">
clusters was checked by a human judge. Un-
fortunately, we did not have the chance yet to
attest the validity of these judgments using
more judges and extracting inter-annotator
agreement rates. We could compare anno-
tations only on a small fraction of cases (15
sense pairs), which we use to make the crite-
rion &amp;quot;valid for IR&amp;quot; precise enough for reliable
annotation. The results are reported in sec-
tions 3.2-3.4 for the different experiments.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99897225">
• Identify all possible lexicographic reasons be-
hind a parallel polysemy, taking advantage of
the previous study. This is reported in the
next section.
• Check how many clusters obtained from Sem-
car also satisfy the parallel translation crite-
rion, to have an idea of the overlap between
both (section 3.5).
• Finally, study whether the results have a de-
pendency on possible incompleteness or in-
adequacy of the InterLingual Index (section

3.1 Typology of parallel polysemy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862916666666">
Parallel polysemy can also be a sign of some sys-
tematic relation between the senses. As it is said
in (Seto, 1996), &amp;quot;(.) There often is a one-to-
one correspondence between different languages in
their lexicalization behaviour towards metonymy,
in other words, metonyrnically related word senses
are often translated by the same word in other lan-
guages&amp;quot;.
But the reasons for parallel polysemy are not
limited only to systematic polysemy. In the case
of the EWN database, we have distinguished the
following causes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.494960833333333">
1. There is a series of mechanisms of meaning
extension, if not universal, at least, common
to several languages:
(a) Generalization/specialization For
example, the following two senses for
band:
English: band; French: groupe; Ger-
man: Band, Musicgruppe
I. Instrumentalists not including string
players
2. A group of musicians playing popular
music for dancing
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.998425">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.986616666666667">
Sense 1 is a specialization of Sense 2, and
this pattern is repeated in French and
German.
(b) Metonymic relations. Some of them
form already well known systematic pol-
ysemy patterns. As for applicability to
IR, we should be capable to discrimi-
nate regular polysemy rules that provide
valid IR clusters from those that contain
senses that can not be interpreted simul-
taneously within a same document. Ex-
amples include:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.979985625">
English: glass; Spanish: vaso
1. container
2. quantity
which is a valid IR cluster, and
English: rabbit; Spanish: conejo;
French: lapin
I. mammal
2.rneat
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.8413701">
which should be distinguished for IR.
(c) Metaphors. This kind of semantic re-
lation usually does not produce good IR
clusters, because senses related by means
of metaphor usually belong to different
semantic fields and, consequently, tend
to occur in distinct documents. For ex-
ample:
English: giant; Spanish: coloso; French:
colosse; Dutch: kolossus
1.a person of exceptional importance and
reputation
2.someone who is abnormally large
(d) Semantic calque or loan transla-
tion. A (probably metaphorical) sense
extension is copied in other languages.
It also can produce undesirable clusters
for IR, because the original relation be-
tween two senses involved can be based
on a metaphor. For example:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.530085571428571">
English: window; Spanish: ventana;
Dutch: venster.

that is a display different of the rest of
the screen

<bodyText confidence="0.995977357142857">
The original computer sense for window
is also adopted in Spanish and German
for the corresponding words ventana and
venster.
2. In certain occasions, the particularities of
how the wordnets have been built semi-
automatically lead to a mimesis of the WN1.5
senses and, consequently, to parallel poly-
semy in several languages. These sense dis-
tinctions are not incorrect, but perhaps would
be different if every monolingual wordnet had
been constructed without WN 1.5 as a refer-
ence for semi-automatic extraction of seman-
tic relations. An example:

The question is what classes of parallel poly-
semy are dominant in EWN, and then whether
parallel polysemy can be taken as a strong indi-
cation of a potential IR cluster. A preliminary
answer to this question is reported in the next

tain a larger subset of 27 clusters. The 17 new

On the overall, we have 15 valid clusters, 11
inappropriate, and one error. The percentage of
useful predictions is 56%, only slightly worse than
for the tighter constraint of experiment 1. It is
worth noticing that:
1. The parallel translation criterion obtained 27
potential clusters for 20 nouns, nearly one
and a half cluster per noun. The criterion
is very productive!
2. The percentage of incorrect clusters (41%)
is high enough to suggest that parallel poly-
semy cannot be taken as a golden rule to clus-
ter close senses, at least with the languages
studied. Even 3 of the negative cases were
homonyms, totally unrelated senses. Perhaps
the general WSD clustering criterion pro-
posed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999) needs
to be revised for a specific application such
as IR. For instance, they argue that clusters
based on parallel polysemy &amp;quot;would eliminate
many distinctions that are arguably better
treated as regular polysemy&amp;quot;. But we have
seen that regular polysemy may lead to sense
distinctions that are important to keep in an
Information Retrieval application. On the
other hand, the results reported in (Resnik
and Yarowsky, 1999) suggest that we would
obtain better clusters if the parallel polysemy
criteria is tested on more distant languages,
such as Japanese or Basque to test English
sense distinctions.

source of information to cluster senses for IR, but
it is as well obvious that it needs to be refined or

To complete evidence for correlation between
Semcor-based clusters and ILI-based clusters, we
studied two subsets of Semcor-based clusters to
check if they matched the parallel polysemy crite-
ria on the ILI. The first set were the 11 sense com-
binations with a co-occurrence frequency above 7
in Semcor. 10 out of 11 (91%) also hold the most
restrictive criterion used in Experiment 1, again
indicating a strong correlation between both cri-
teria. Then we augmented the set of sense com-
binations to 50 - with co-occurrence frequencies
above 2-. This time, 27 clusters matched the cri-
terion in Experiment 2 (54%). As the evidence
for Semcor clustering decreases, the criterion of
parallel translations is also less reliable, again in-
dicating a correlation between both.

Clustering methods based on the criterion of par-

the adequacy and quality of the lexical resources
used. How many ILI clusters had we obtained in

pletely error-free?

roneous equivalence links in the Spanish and
Dutch wordnets. Taking into account that
EWN was built by semi-automatic means,
this seems a low error rate.
• Only 16 senses out of 73 have equivalence
links in the 4 selected wordnets. 19 senses
have equivalence links in 3 languages, 21
senses in 2 languages, 9 in only one language
and 6 have no equivalence links in any of the
selected wordnets. The lack of equivalence
links sometimes can be explained by the lack
of lexicalized terms for a certain WN concept.
For example, float2 (a drink with ice-cream
floating in it) is not lexicalized in Spanish, so
we should not expect an equivalence link for
this sense in the Spanish wordnet. In many
other cases though, the lack of the equiva-
lence links is due to incompleteness in the
database.
• Each monolingual wordnet reflects, to a
large extent, the kind of Machine-Readable
resources used to build it. The Span-
ish wordnet was built mainly from bilin-
gual dictionaries and therefore is closer to
the Wn 1.5 structure. The French word-
net departed from an ontology-like database,
and thus some non-lexicalized expressions
are still present (for instance, float 2 has
soda_avec_un_boule_de_glace as French equiv-
alent). The Dutch wordnet departed from a
lexical database rich in semantic information,
thus it departs more from the Wordnet struc-
ture, has a richer connectivity and complex
links into the InterLingual Index, etc. Cross-
Language equivalent relations are not, there-
fore, totally homogeneous in EWN.
On the overall, however, the ILI seems per-
fectly suitable for automatic applications regard-
ing multilingual sense mappings. In particular,
the fine-grainedness of Wordnet and EuroWord-
Net, in spite of its lack of popularity among NLP
researchers, may be an advantage for NLP appli-
cations, as it may suit different clusterings for dif-
ferent application requirements.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999209">
We examined three different types of sense chis-
tering criteria with an Information Retrieval ap-
plication in mind: methods based on the word-
net structure (such as generalization, cousins, sis-
ters...); co-occurrence of senses obtained from
Semcor; and equivalent translations of senses in
other languages via the EuroWordNet InterLin-
gual Index (ILI). We conclude that a) different
NLP applications demand not only different sense
granularities but different (possibly overlapped)
sense clusterings. b) co-occurrence of senses in
Semcor provide strong evidence for Information
Retrieval clusters, unlike methods based on word-
net structure and systematic polysemy. c) parallel
polysemy in two or more languages via the ILI, be-
sides providing sense clusters for MT and CLIR, is
correlated with coocurring senses in Semcor, and
thus can be useful to obtain IR clusters as well.
Both approaches to IR clusters for WN/EWN
(evidence from Semcor and from the ILI) seem
very promising. The positive and negative evi-
dence from Semcor (above 500 clusters each) can
possibly be used in a Machine Learning approach
to find additional clusters for the remaining sense
distinctions without enough evidence from Sem-
cor. The parallel polysemy criteria, over EWN, is
highly productive (more than one candidate per
word in our experiments), although a more diverse
set of languages would probably produce a higher
rate of valid clusters.

It is probably reasonable to classify different systematic polysemy rules according to whether they produce M clusters or not. Some, already identified, patterns of regular polysemy, such as container/quantity or music/dance (Peters and Peters, 2000) yield adequate IR clusters. Other patterns, such as animal/food, plant/food, animal/skin, language/people tend to produce clusters that are not valid for IR. This classification of polysemy patterns is, to our opinion, strongly related with the black and white dot operators introduced in (Buitelaar, 1998). The black operator was reserved for polysemy patterns including sets of senses that may co-occur in the same word instance (e.g. book as written work or as physical object), and white operator is reserved for polysemy patterns for senses that never co-occur in the same word instance (e.g. window as physical object or as computer frame). Unfortunately, the distinction between black and white operators classes has not been applied yet -to our knowledge - to the set of polysemous classes defined in Buitelaar&apos;s thesis.

It is commonly assumed that sense distinctions in these lexical databases are too fine-grained for a majority of applications. In particular, we have used EuroWordNet in a Cross-Language Text Retrieval (CLTR) application (Verdejo et al., 2000) and a number of CLTR experiments (Gonzalo et al., 1999; Vossen et al., 1999), confirming that it is crucial to apply certain sense clusters to Wordnet (WN) and EuroWordNet (EWN) to take real advantage of them in Information Retrieval applications. Potentially, a semantic network such as WN/EWN can help distinguishing different word senses for retrieval, enhancing precision, and identifying synonymic or conceptually related terms, enhancing recall. But not all sense distinctions in a lexical database are meaningful for Information Retrieval. For instance, the following sense distinctions are superfluous in an information retrieval application, as </context>

This is a direct criterion to cluster senses in Machine Translation or CrossLanguage Text Retrieval. Then we measure the overlap between both criteria, to conclude that the EWN InterLingual Index is also a valuable source of evidence for Information Retrieval clusters. 2 Cluster evidence from Semcor One of our goals within the EuroWordNet and ITEM projects was to provide sense clusterings for WordNet (and, in general,for the EuroWordNet InterLingual Index, (Gonzalo et al., 1999) that leave only the sense distinctions in wordnets that indicate different (semantic) indexing units for Information Retrieval. Our first lexicographic examination of WordNet sense distinctions and clusterings following criteria based on the wordnet hierarchy did not produce clear criteria to classify senses semi-automatically according to this IR requirement. As we mentioned before, the clusters applied on the EWN InterLingual Index which relied solely on hierarchical information in Wordnet, produced a slight decrease of retrieval performance in an experiment using ILI records as indexing un</context>

The threshold was set in, at least, 8 occurrences of each sense in Semcor, resulting in more than 500 negative clusters. A manual verification of 50 of these negative clusters showed that about 80% of them were acceptable for Information Retrieval as senses that should be distinguished. Together with the positive evidence, we have more than 1100 training cases for a binary classifier. Our plan is to apply this classifier to the whole EWN InterLingual Index, and then perform precision/recall tests in the environment described in (Gonzalo et al., 1998; Gonzalo et al., 1999). 3 Cluster evidence from the ILI When translated into a target language, sense distinctions of a word may be lexicalind. For instance, the English term spring is translated into Spanish as primavem in its &amp;quot;season&amp;quot; sense, into muelle in its &amp;quot;metal device&amp;quot; sense, or as fuente in its &amp;quot;fountain&amp;quot; sense. For an English-Spanish Machine Translation system, it is crucial to distinguish these three senses of spring. But it is also frequent that two or more senses of a word are translated into the same word, for one or more languages. For instance, child as &amp;quot;human offspring (son or daughter) of any age&amp;quot;</context>

In this case, this criterion successfully detects a pair of senses that could be clustered for Information Retrieval purposes. In order to test the general validity of this criterion, we have followed these steps: • Select a set of nouns for a full manual study. We have chosen the set of 22 nouns used in the first SENSEVAL competition (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000). This set satisfied our requirements of size (small enough for an exhaustive manual revision), reasonable degree of polysemy, and unbiased for our testing purposes (the criteria to select these 22 nouns was obviously independent of our experiment). We had to reduce the original set to 20 nouns (corresponding to 73 EWN senses), as the other two nouns were polysemous in the Hector database used for SENSEVAL, but monosemous in WordNet 1.5 and EuroWordNet. As target languages we chose Spanish, French, Dutch and German. • Extract the candidate senses that satisfy the parallel polysemy criterion, i</context>

We conclude that a) different NLP applications demand not only different sense granularities but different (possibly overlapped) sense clusterings. b) co-occurrence of senses in Semcor provide strong evidence for Information Retrieval clusters, unlike methods based on wordnet structure and systematic polysemy. c) parallel polysemy in three or more languages via the ILI, besides providing sense clusters for MT and CLIR, is strongly correlated with co-occurring senses in Semcor, and thus can be useful for Information Retrieval as well. 1 Introduction WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), as most large-coverage electronic dictionaries and semantic networks, are not designed for a specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) application. It is commonly assumed that sense distinctions in these lexical databases are too fine-grained for a majority of applications. In particular, we have used EuroWordNet in a Cross-Language Text Retrieval (CLTR) application (Verdejo et al., 2000) and a number of CLTR experiments (Gonzalo et al., 1999; Vossen et al., 1999), confirming that it is crucial to apply certain sense clusters to Wordnet (WN) and EuroWordNet (E</context>

While clustering the EWN Interlingual Index records on the basis of systematic polysemy proved useful to provide better interlanguages connectivity in the EWN database, this result supports the idea that systematic polysemy, per se, is not an indication of potential IR clusters. However, we do not claim that all systematic polysemy patterns are useless for IR. It is probably reasonable to classify different systematic polysemy rules according to whether they produce M clusters or not. Some, already identified, patterns of regular polysemy, such as container/quantity or music/dance (Peters and Peters, 2000) yield adequate IR clusters. Other patterns, such as animal/food, plant/food, animal/skin, language/people tend to produce clusters that are not valid for IR. This classification of polysemy patterns is, to our opinion, strongly related with the black and white dot operators introduced in (Buitelaar, 1998). The black operator was reserved for polysemy patterns including sets of senses that may co-occur in the same word instance (e.g. book as written work or as physical object), and white operator is reserved for polysemy patterns for senses that never co-occur in the same word instance (e.g. w</context>

We have scanned Semcor in search of sets of (two or more) senses that co-occur frequently enough. In practice, we started with a threshold of at least 2 documents (out of 171) with the co-occurring senses in a similar distribution. We did not use the original Semcor files, but the IR-Semcor partition (Gonzalo et al., 1998) that splits multi-text documents into coherent retrieval chunks. We completed this list of candidates to cluster with pairs of senses that only co-occur once but belong to any &amp;quot;cousin&amp;quot; combination (Peters et al., 1998). Finally, we obtained 507 sets of sense combinations (producing above 650 sense pairs) for which Semcor provides positive evidence for clustering. A manual verification of 50 of such clusters showed that above 70% of them were useful. We also noticed that raising the threshold (the number of documents in which the senses cooccur), the error rate decreases quickly. Then we worked with this set of positive IR clusters, trying to identify a set of common features that could be used to cluster the rest of WN/EWN senses.

We will use the term &amp;quot;parallel poly-- semy&amp;quot; to refer to this situation in the rest of this article. Obviously, a Machine Translation system does not need to distinguish these two senses. But it is also tempting to hypothesize that the existence of parallel polysemy in two or more target languages may indicate that the two senses are close enough to be clustered in more applications. Indeed, in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999) this criterion is proposed to determine which word senses should be retained or discarded in a testbed for automatic Word Sense Disambiguation systems. In particular, our goal has been to test whether two or more senses of a word are likely to be clustered, for IR purposes, if they have parallel polysemy in a certain number of languages via the EuroWordNet InterLingual Index. If the answer is positive, then the InterLingual Index, with eight languages interconnected, would be a rich source of information to provide IR clusters.

This is reported in the next section. • Check how many clusters obtained from Semcar also satisfy the parallel translation criterion, to have an idea of the overlap between both (section 3.5). • Finally, study whether the results have a dependency on possible incompleteness or inadequacy of the InterLingual Index (section 3.6). 3.1 Typology of parallel polysemy Parallel polysemy can also be a sign of some systematic relation between the senses. As it is said in (Seto, 1996), &amp;quot;(.)
