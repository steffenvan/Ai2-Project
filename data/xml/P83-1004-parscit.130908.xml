Metagrammatical formalisms that combine context-free
phrase structure rules and metarules (MPS grammars) allow con-
cise statement of generalizations about the syntax of natural lan-
guages. Unconstrained MPS grammars, unfortunately, are not
computationally &amp;quot;safe.&amp;quot; We evaluate several proposals for con-

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999586">
The computational-linguistics community has recently
shown interest in a variety of metagrammatical formalisms for
encoding grammars of natural language. A common technique
found in these formalisms involves the notion of a metaruk,
which, in its most common conception, is a device used to
generate grammar rules from other given grammar rules.&apos; A
metarule is essentially a statement declaring that, it a grammar
contains rules that match one specified pattern, it also contains
rules that match some other specified pattern. For example, the
following metarule

states that, if there is a rule that expands a finite VP into a
finite auxiliary and a nonfinite VP, there will also be a rule
that expands the VP as before except for an additional adverb
between the auxiliary and the nonfinite VP.2 The patterns may
contain variables, in which case they characterize &amp;quot;families&amp;quot; of
related rules rather than individual pairs.

We are indebted to Fernando Pereira, Stanley Peters, and Stanley
Roscnschein for many helpful discussions leading to the writing of this paper.
IMetarules were first utilized for natural-language research and are most
extensively developed within the theory of Generalized Phrase Structure
Grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar and Pullum, 1982; Gawron et 41, 1982;
Thompson. 19821.
2A metarule similar to our example was proposed by Gazdar, Pullum, and
Sag (1982, P. 8071.
The metarule notion is a seductive one, intuitively allowing
generalizations about the grammar of a language to be stated
concisely. However, unconstrained metarule formalisms may
possess more expressive power than is apparently needed, and,
moreover, they are not always computationally Safe.&amp;quot; For ex-
ample, they may generate infinite sets of rules and describe ar-
bitrary languages. In this paper we examine both the formal
and linguistic implications of various constraints on metagram-
matical formalisms consisting of a combination of context-free
phrase structure rules and metarules, which we will call metarule
phrase-structure (MPS) grammars.
The term &apos;`MPS grammar&amp;quot; is used in two ways in this
paper. An MPS grammar can be viewed as a grammar in its
own right that characterizes a language directly. Alternatively,
it can be viewed as a meiagrammar, that is, as a generator of
a phrase structure object grammar, the characterized language
being defined as the language of the object grammar.
Uszkoreit and Peters 119821 have developed a formal
definition of MPS grammars and have shown that an uncon-
strained MPS grammar can encode any recursively enumerable
language. As long as the framework for grammatical descrip-
tion is not seen as part of a theory of natural language, this
fact may not affect the usefulness of MPS grammars as tools for
purely descriptive linguistics research; however, it has direct and
obvious impact on those doing research in a computational or
theoretical linguistic paradigm. Clearly, some way of constrain-
ing the power of MPS grammars is necessary to enable their use
for encoding grammars in a computationally feasible way. In
the sections that follow, we consider several formal proposals for
constraining their power and discus, some of their computational
and linguistic ramifications.
In our discussion of the computational ramifications of the
proposed constraints, we will use the notion of weak-generative
capacity as a barometer of the expressive power of a formalism.
Other notions of expressivity are possible, although some of
the traditional ones may not. be applicable to MPS grammars.
Strong-generative capacity, for instance, though well-defined,
seems to be an inadequate notion for comparison of MPS gram-
mars, since it would have to be extended to include informa-
tion about rule derivations as well as tree derivations. Similarly,
we do not mean to imply by our arguments that the class of
natural languages corresponds to some class that ranks low in
the Chomsky hierarchy merely because the higher classes are less
constrained in weak-generative power. The appropriate charac-
terization of possible natural languages may not coincide at all
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.994751338461539">
with the divisions in the Chomsky hierarchy. Nevertheless weak-
generative capacity—the weakest useful metric of capacity—will
be the primary concern of this paper as a well-defined and
relevant standard for measuring constraints.
2. Constraints by Change of Perspective
Peters and Ritchie 119731 have pointed out that context-
sensitive grammars have no more than context-free power when
their rules are viewed as node-admissibility conditions. This
suggests that MPS grammars might be analogously constrained
by regarding the metarules as something other than phrase-
structure grammar generators. A brief examination of three
alternative approaches indicates, however, that none of them
clearly yields any useful constraints on weak-generative capacity.
Two of the alternatives discussed below consider metarules to be
part of the grammar itself, rather than as part of the metagram-
mar. The third views them as a set of redundant generalizations
about the grammar.
Stucky Iforthcomind investigates the possibility of defining
metarules as complex node-admissibility conditions, which she
calls meta-node-admissibility conditions. Two computationally
desirable results could ensue, were this reinterpretation possible.
Because the metarules do not generate rules under the meta-
node-admissibility interpretation, it follows that there will be
neither a combinatorial explosion of rules nor any derivation
resulting in an infinite set of rules (both of which are potential
problems that could arise under the original generative inter-
pretation).
For this reinterpretation to have a computationally tract-
able implementation, however, two preconditions must be met.
First, an independent mechanism must be provided that assigns
to any string a finite set of trees, including those admitted by
the metarules together with the base rules. Second, a procedure
must be defined that checks node admissibilities according to the
base rules and metarules of the grammar—and that terminates.
It is this latter condition that we suspect will not be possible
without constraining the weak-generative capacity of MPS gram-
mars. Thus, this perspective does not seem to change the basic
expressivity problems of the formalism by itself.
A second alternative, proposed by Kay 119821, is one in
which metarules are viewed as chart-manipulating operators on
a chart parser. Here too, the metarules are not part of a
metagrammar that generates a context-free grammar; rather,
they constitute a second kind of rule in the grammar. Just
like the meta-node-admissibility interpretation, Kay&apos;s explica-
tion seems to retain the basic problem of expressive power,
though Kay hints at a gain in efficiency if the metarules are
compiled into a finite-state transducer.
Finally, an alternative that does not integrate metarules
into the object grammar but, on the other hand, does not as-
sign them a role in generating an object grammar either, is to
view them as redundancy statements describing the relationships
that hold among rules in the full grammar. This interpretation
eliminates the problem of generating infinite rule sets that gave
rise to the Uszkoreit and Peters results. However, it is difficult
to see how the solution supports a computationally useful notion
of metarules, since it requires that all rules of the grammar be
stated explicitly. Confining the role of metarules to that of stat-
ing redundancies prevents their productive application, so that
the metarules serve no clear computational purpose for grammar
implementation.3
We thus conclude that, in contrast to context-sensitive
grammars, in which an alternative interpretation of the phrase
structure rules makes a difference in weak-generative capacity,
NIPS grammars do not seem to benefit from the reinterpretations
we have investigated.

3. Formal Constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766964285714">
at e it appears unlikely that a reinterpretation of MPS
grammars can be found that solves their complexity problem,
formal constraints on the MPS formalism itself have to be ex-
plored if we want to salvage the basic concept of metarules. In
the following examination of currently proposed constraints, the
two criteria for evaluation are their effects on computational trac-
tability and on the explanatory adequacy of the formalism.
As an example of constraints that satisfy the criterion of
computational tractability but not that of explanatory adequacy,
we examine the issue of essential variables. These are variables in
the metarule pattern that can match an arbitrary string of items
in a phrase structure rule. Uszkoreit and Peters have shown that,
contrary to an initial conjecture by Joshi (see Pazdar, 1982,
fn. 281), allowing even one such variable per metarule extends
the power of the formalism to recursive enumerability. Gazdar
has recommended 11982, p.16131 that the power of metarules be
controlled by eliminating essential variables, exchanging them
for abbreviatory variables that can stand only for strings in a
finite and extrinsically determined range. This constraint yields
a computationally tractable system with only context-free power.
Exchanging essential for abbreviatory variables is not,
however, as attractive a prospect as it appears at first blush.
Uszkoreit and Peters 119821 show that by restricting MPS gram-
mars to using abbreviatory variables only, some significant
generalizations are lost. Consider the following metarule that
is proposed and motivated in Pazdar 19821 for endowing VSO
languages with the category VP. The metarule generates flat
VSO sentence rules from VP rules.

<bodyText confidence="0.776616">
Since U is an abbreviatory variable, its range needs to be stated
explicitly. Let us imagine *hat the VSO language in question has

If these VP rules are the only rules that satisfy the left-
hand side of (2), then (2) generates exactly the same rules as it
would if we declared U to be an essential variable—i.e., let its
range be (VT IJ VN). But now imagine that the language adopts
a new subcategorization frame for verbs,4 e.g., a verb that takes
an NP and an 3 as complements. VP rule (4) is added:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.459586">
(4) VP V NP
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999777577777778">
Metarule (2) predicts that VPs headed by this verb do not have
a corresponding flat VSO sentence rule. We will have to change
the metarule by extending the range of U in order to retain the
generalization originally intended by the metarule. Obviously,
our metarule did not encode the right generalization (a simple
intension-extension problem).
This shortcoming can also surface in cases where the input
to a metarule is the output of another metarule. It might be
that metarule (2) not only applies to basic verb rules but also
includes the output of, say, a passive rule. The range of the
variable U would have to be extended to cover then cases too,
and, moreover, might have to be altered if its feeding metarules
change.
Thus, if the restriction to abbreviator), variables is to have
no effect on the weak-generative capacity of a grammar, the
range assigned to each variable must include the range that
would have actually instantiated the variable on an expansion of
the MPS grammar in which the variable AM treated as essential.
The assignment of a range to the variable can only be done post
factum. This would be a satisfactory result, were it not for the
fact that finding the necessary range of a variable in this way
is an undecidable problem in general. Thus, to exchange essen-
tial for abbreviatory variables is to risk affecting the generative
capacity of the grammar—with quite unintuitive and unpredict-
able results. In short, the choice is among three options: to affect
the language of the grammar in ways that are linguistically un-
motivated and arbitrary, to solve an undecidable problem, or
to discard the notion of exchanging essential for abbreviatory
variables—in effect, a Hobson&apos;a choice.
An example of a constraint that satisfies the second
criterion, that of explanatory adequacy, but not the first, com-
putational tractability, is the lexical-head constraint of GPSG
[Gazdar and Pullum, 19821. This constraint allows metarules
to operate only on rules whose stipulated head is a lexical
(preterminal) category. Since the Uszkoreit and Peters results are
achieved even under this restriction to the formalism, the con-
straint does not provide a solution to the problem of expressive
power. Of course, this is no criticism of the proposal, since it was
never intended as a formal restriction on the class of languages,
but rather as a restriction on linguistically motivated grammars.
Unfortunately, the motivation behind even this use of the lexical-
head constraint may be lacking. One of the few analyses that
relies on the lexical-head constraint is a recent GPSG analysis of
coordination and extraction in English [Gazdar, 19811. In this
case—indeed, in general—one could achieve the desired effect

4Note that it does not matter whether the grammar writer discovers an

<bodyText confidence="0.949985038461538">
simply by specifying that the coefficient of the bar feature be
lexical. It remains to be seen whether the constraint must be
imposed for enough metarules so as to justify its incorporation
as a general principle.
Even with such motivation one might raise a question
about the advisability of the lexical-head constraint on a meta-
theoretical level. The linguistic intuition behind the constraint
is that the role of metarules is to &amp;quot;express generalizations about
possibilities of subcategorization&amp;quot; exclusively [Gazdar, Klein,
Pullum, and Sag, 1982, p.39], e.g., to express the passive-active
relation. This result is said to follow from principles of syntax
Packendoff, 18771, in which just those categories that are sub-
categorized for are siblings of a lexical head. However, in a lan-
guage with freer word order than English, categories other than
those subcategorized for will be siblings of lexical heads; they
would, thus, be affected by metarules even under the lexical-head
constraint. This result will certainly follow from the liberation
rule approach to free word order [Pullum, 19821. The original
linguistic generalization intended by the lexical-head constraint,
therefore, will not hold cross-linguistically.
Finally, there is the current proposal of the GPSG com-
munity for constraining the formal powers of metarules by al-
lowing each metarule to apply only once in a derivation of a
rule. Originally dubbed the once-through hypothesis, this con-
straint is now incorporated into GPSG under the name finite
closure [Gazdar and Pullum, 19821. Although linguistic evidence
for the constraint has never been provided, the formal motiva-
tion is quite strong because, under this constraint, the metarule
formalism would have only context-free power.
Several linguistic constructions present problems with
respect to the adequacy of the finite-closure hypothesis. For in-
stance, the liberation rule technique for handling free-word-order
languages (Pullum, 19821 would require a noun-phrase liberation
rule to be applied twice in a derivation of a rule with sibling
noun phrases that permute their subconstituents freely among
one another. As a hypothetical example of this phenomenon, let
us suppose that English allowed relative clauses to be extraposed
in general from noun phrases, instead of allowing just one ex-
traposition. For instance, in this quasi-English, the sentence
(5) Two children are chasing the dog who are small that is
here.
would be a grammatical paraphrase of
(6) Two children who are small are chasing the dog that is
here.
Let us suppose further that the analysis of this phenomenon
involved liberation of the NP S substructure of the noun phrases
for incorporation into the main sentence. Then the noun-phrase
liberation rule would apply once to liberate the subject noun
phrase, once again to liberate the object noun phrase. That these
are not idle concerns is demonstrated by the following sentence
in the free-word-order Australian aboriginal language Warlpiri.5

The Warlpiri example is analogous to the quasi-English
example in that both sentences have two discontinuous NPs in
the same distribution. Furthermore, the liberation rule approach
has been proposed as a method of modeling the free word order
of Warlpiri. Thus, it appears that finite closure is not. consistent
with the liberation rule approach to free word order.
Adverb distribution presents another problem for the
hypothesis. In German, for example, and to a lesser extent in
English, an unbounded number of adverbs can be quite freely
interspersed with the complements of a verb. The following
German sentence is an extreme example of this phenomenon
(Uszkoreit, 19821. The sequence of its major constituents is given
under (9).
(8) Gestern hatte in der Mittagspau3e

A metarule might therefore be proposed that inserts a
single adverb in a verb-phrase rule. Repeated application
of this rule (in contradiction to the finite-closure hypothesis)
would achieve the desired effect. To maintain the finite-closure
hypothesis, we could merely extend the notion of context-free
rule to allow regular expressions on the right-hand side of a
rule. The verb phrase rule would then be accurately, albeit
clumsily, expressed as, say, VP NP ADVP* or VP—.
V NP ADVP* PP ADVP* for ditranaitives.
Similar constructions in free-word-order languages do not
permit such naive solutions. As an example, let US consider
the Japanese causative. In this construction, the verb suffix
&amp;quot;-sase&amp;quot; signals the causativization of the verb, allowing an extra
NP argument. The process is putatively unbounded (ignoring
performance limitations). Furthermore, Japanese allows the NPs
to order freely relative to one another (subject to considerations
of ambiguity and focus), so that a fiat structure with some kind
of extrinsic ordering is presumably preferable.
One means of achieving a flat structure with extrinsic
ordering is by using the ID/LP formalism, a subformalism of
GPSG that allows immediate dominance (ID) information to he
specified separately from linear precedence (LP) notions. (Cf.
context-free phrase structure grammar, which forces a strict one-
to-one correlation between the two types of information.) ID
information is specified by context-free style rules with unordered
right-hand sides, notated, e.g., A B, C, D. LP information is
specified as a partial order over the nonterminals in the t!.r., m mar,
notated, e.g., B &lt; C (read B precedes C). These two rules
can be viewed as schematizing a set of three context-free rules,
namely, A--.BCD, andA—.DB C.
Without a causativization metarule that can operate more
than once, we might attempt to use the regular expression nota-
tion that solved the adverb problem. For example, we might
postulate the ID rule VP NP* , V , ease* with the LP rela-
tion NP &lt; V &lt; ease, but no matching of NPs with eases
is achieved. We might attempt to write a liberation rule that
pulls NP-ease pairs from a nested structure into a flat one,
but this would violate the finite-closure hypothesis (as well as
Pullum&apos;s requirement precluding liberation through a recursive
category). We could attempt to use even more of the power of
regular-expression rules with ID/LP, i.e., VP •-• {N P , acme}&amp;quot;, V
under the same LP relation. The formalism presupposed by this
analysis, however, has greater than context-free power,6 so that
this solution may not be desirable. Nevertheless, it should not
be ruled out before the parsing properties of such a formalism
are under3tood.7 Gunji&apos;s analysis of Japanese, which attempts
to solve such problems with the multiple application of a slash
introduction metarule (Gunji, 19801, again raises the problem of
violating the finite-closure hypothesis (as well as being incom-
patible with the current version of GPSG which disallows mul-
tiple slashes). Finally, we could always move causativization into
the lexicon as a lexical rule. Such a move, though it does cir-
cumvent the difficulty in the syntax, merely serves to move it
elsewhere without resolving the basic problem.
Yet another alternative involves treating the right-hand
sides of phrase structure rules as sets, rather than multisets as is
implicit in the 1D/LP format. Since the nonterminal vocabulary
is finite, right-hand sides of ID rules must be subsets of a finite
set and therefore finite sets themselves. This hypothesis is quite
similar in effect to the finite-closure hypothesis, albeit even more
limited, and thus inherits the same problems as were discussed
above.

4. The Ultimate Solution

<bodyText confidence="0.9998432">
An obvious way to constrain MPS grammars is to eliminate
metarules entirely and replace them with other mechanisms. In
fact, within the GPSG paradigm, several of the functions of
metarules have been replaced by other metagrammatical devices.
Other functions have not, as of the writing of this paper, though

directly that includes a method for utilizing the Kleene star device. It
could be extended to even more of the regular expression notation, though
the effect of such extension on the time complexity of the algorithm is an
open question.

<bodyText confidence="0.999573280701755">
it is instructive to consider the ewes coven.ci ay this class. In
the discussion to follow we have isolated three of the primary
functions of metarules. This is not intended as an exhaustive
taxonomy, and certain metarules may manifest more than one
of these functions.
First, we consider generalizations over linear order. If
metarules are metagrammatical statements about rules encod-
ing linear order, they may relate rules that differ only in the
linear order of categories. With the introduction of ID/LP for-
mat, however, the hypothesis is that this latter metagrammatical
device will suffice to account for the linear order among the cat-
egories within rules. For instance, the problematic adverb and
causative metarules could be replaced by extended context-free
rules with ID/LP, as was suggested in Section 3 above. Shieber
[forthcoming] has shown that a pure ID/LP formalism (without
metarules, Kleene star, or the like) is no less computationally
tractable than context-fret grammars themselves. Although we
do not yet know what the consequences of incorporating the
extended context-free rules would be for computational com-
plexity, ID/LP format can be used to replace certain word-order-
variation metarules.
A second function of metarules was to relate sets of rules
that differed only in the values of certain specifed features. It
has been suggested [Gazdar and Pullum 19821 that such features
are distributed according to certain general principles. For in-
stance, the slash-propagation metarule has been replaced by the
distribution of slash features in accord with such a principle.
A third function of metarules under the original interpreta-
tion has not been relegated to other metagrammatical devices.
We have no single device to suggest, though we are exploring
alternative ways to account for the phenomena. Formally, this
third class can be characterized as comprising those metarules
that. relate sets of rules in which the number of categories on the
right- and left-hand sides of rules differ. It is this sort of metarule
that is essential for the extension of GPSGs beyond context-free
power in the Uszkoreit and Peters proofs [19821. Simply requiring
that such metarules be disallowed would not resolve the linguistic
issues, however, since this constraint would inherit the problems
connected with the regular expression and set notations discussed
in Section 3 above. This third class further breaks down into two
cases: those that have different parent categories on the right-
and left-hand sides of the metarule and those that have the same
category on both sides. The first case includes those liberation
rules that figure in analyses of free-word-order phenomena, plus
such other rules as the subject-auxiliary-inversion metarule in
English. Uszkoreit [forthcoming] is exploring a method for isolat-
ing liberation rules in a separate metagrammatical formalism. It
also appears that the subject-auxiliary inversion may be analyzed
by already existing principles governing the distribution of fea-
tures. The second case (those in which the categories on the
right. and left-hand sides are the same) includes such analyses
as the passive in English. This instance, at least, might be re-
placed by a lexical-redundancy rule. Thus, no uniform solution
has yet been found for this third function of metarules.
We conclude that it may be possible to replace MPS-style
metagrammatical formalisms entirely without losing generaliza-
tions. We are consequently pursuing researcu

The formal power of metarule formalisms is clearly an
important consideration for computational linguists. Uszkoreit
and Peters [1982] have shown that the potential exists for
defining metarule formalisms that are computationally &apos;unsafe.&amp;quot;
However, theste results do not sound a death knell for metarules.
On the contrary, the safety of metarule formalisms is still an
open question. We have merely shown that the constraints on
metarules necessary to make them formally tractable will have to
be based on empirical linguistic evidence as well as solid formal
research. The solutions to constraining metarules analyzed here
seem to be either formally or linguistically inadequate. Further
research is aeeded in the actual uses of metarules and in con-
structions that are problematic for metarules so as to develop
either linguistically motivated and computationally interesting
constraints on the formalisms, or alternative formalisms that are
linguistically adequate but not heir to the problems of metarules.

Finally, we could always move causativization into the lexicon as a lexical rule. Such a move, though it does circumvent the difficulty in the syntax, merely serves to move it elsewhere without resolving the basic problem. Yet another alternative involves treating the right-hand sides of phrase structure rules as sets, rather than multisets as is implicit in the 1D/LP format.

IMetarules were first utilized for natural-language research and are most extensively developed within the theory of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar and Pullum, 1982; Gawron et 41, 1982; Thompson. 19821. 2A metarule similar to our example was proposed by Gazdar, Pullum, and Sag (1982, P. 8071.

In short, the choice is among three options: to affect the language of the grammar in ways that are linguistically unmotivated and arbitrary, to solve an undecidable problem, or to discard the notion of exchanging essential for abbreviatory variables—in effect, a Hobson&apos;a choice. An example of a constraint that satisfies the second criterion, that of explanatory adequacy, but not the first, computational tractability, is the lexical-head constraint of GPSG [Gazdar and Pullum, 19821. This constraint allows metarules to operate only on rules whose stipulated head is a lexical (preterminal) category. Since the Uszkoreit and Peters results are achieved even under this restriction to the formalism, the constraint does not provide a solution to the problem of expressive power. Of course, this is no criticism of the proposal, since it was never intended as a formal restriction on the class of languages, but rather as a restriction on linguistically motivated grammars. Unfortunately, the motivation behind even this use of the lexicalhead constraint may be lacking. One of the f</context>

This result is said to follow from principles of syntax Packendoff, 18771, in which just those categories that are subcategorized for are siblings of a lexical head. However, in a language with freer word order than English, categories other than those subcategorized for will be siblings of lexical heads; they would, thus, be affected by metarules even under the lexical-head constraint. This result will certainly follow from the liberation rule approach to free word order [Pullum, 19821. The original linguistic generalization intended by the lexical-head constraint, therefore, will not hold cross-linguistically. Finally, there is the current proposal of the GPSG community for constraining the formal powers of metarules by allowing each metarule to apply only once in a derivation of a rule. Originally dubbed the once-through hypothesis, this constraint is now incorporated into GPSG under the name finite closure [Gazdar and Pullum, 19821. Although linguistic evidence for the constraint has never been provided, the formal motivation is quite strong because, under this constrai</context>

Shieber [forthcoming] has shown that a pure ID/LP formalism (without metarules, Kleene star, or the like) is no less computationally tractable than context-fret grammars themselves. Although we do not yet know what the consequences of incorporating the extended context-free rules would be for computational complexity, ID/LP format can be used to replace certain word-ordervariation metarules. A second function of metarules was to relate sets of rules that differed only in the values of certain specifed features. It has been suggested [Gazdar and Pullum 19821 that such features are distributed according to certain general principles. For instance, the slash-propagation metarule has been replaced by the distribution of slash features in accord with such a principle. A third function of metarules under the original interpretation has not been relegated to other metagrammatical devices. We have no single device to suggest, though we are exploring alternative ways to account for the phenomena. Formally, this third class can be characterized as comprising those metarules that. relate sets of rules in which the number of categories on the right- and le</context>
