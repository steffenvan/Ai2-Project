This volume contains the papers presented at the workshop on Recent Advances
in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, held on 8 October 2000
in conjunction with the 38th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics (ACL).
The aim of the workshop was to foster the interaction between researchers in the
areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), and
furthermore, to promote discussion on the current and potential benefits of com-
mon approaches to related research challenges. In putting the workshop together,
our goal was to bring these two communities together to establish opportunity for
communication. We hope there will be similar workshops at IR related conferences
so that a gradual closing of the existing gaps will occur. This workshop is not the
first on the topic, but one which reflects what we believe are increasing trends as
each field reaches its limits.
The growing research and application possibilities provided by the increased
amount of networked information have motivated new attempts to explore the re-
lationship between NLP and IR. For researchers in IR, a compelling challenge is to
move from (monolingual) document retrieval within controlled text collections, to
actually retrieving information, rather than individual documents, from multilin-
gual, heterogeneous and dynamic webs of interlinked documents and online services.
The reciprocal challenge for NLP research is to scale up, adapt and possibly reshape
techniques and resources to help bridge the gap between document and information
retrieval in practical applications.
The central topic of the workshop was the application of language technologies
to information retrieval, including
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.943915222222222">
• the role of lexical-syntactic information in mono- and multilingual IR, includ-
ing morphology, phrase detection and treatment, word sense disambiguation
adapted to IR needs, acquisition and use of lexical resources, etc.
• empirical evidence regarding the use of NL techniques in different retrieval
scenarios, typification of such scenarios, and the discussion of evaluation mea-
sures beyond precision/recall variants.
• interaction between NLP and IR techniques in topics related to both areas
such as Cross-Language and Interactive Text Retrieval, Question Answering,
Information Extraction, Text Summarization, Text Data Mining, etc.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98430080952381">
The original call for papers resulted in 25 submissions, from which 10 papers
were selected on the basis of a thorough reviewing process. A majority of the
papers contained in this volume study how to improve retrieval processes using
syntactic and semantic information, including lexical expansions for web querying,
semantic indexing, phrasal indexing in different languages, acquisition and use of
lexical databases, etc. The remaining papers combine NL techniques from related
areas - summarization, information extraction - to extend search capabilities and
presentation of results, including summarization of search engine hit lists and sum-
marization for text categorization, and a search interface that accepts template-like
general constraints and is able to return specific information items such as locations,
.nple or companies that satisfy user&apos;s constraints. Although none of these papers
deal directly with cross-language issues (well covered in the Cross-Language Evalu-
ation Forum held at Lisbon two weeks earlier), the monolingual systems presented
here cover five different languages (English, Japanese, Korean, Italian and Czech).
We would like to first of all thank the authors, whose research contributions
have made this workshop possible. Thanks are due also to the following: Nicoletta
Oak°lari (the ACL workshop chair), David Yarowsky, Priscilla Rasmussen and the
local organizing committee at HKUST. Finally, we would like to express our deep
gratitude to the members of the program committee, who did a careful reviewing
job under tight time constraints.
