Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980727272727">
This paper describes a bilingual sign language
dictionary (Japanese Sign Language and
American Sign Language) that can help
people learn each sign language directly from
their mother sign language. Our discussion
covers two main points. The first describes
the necessity for a bilingual dictionary. Since
there is no &amp;quot;universal sign language&amp;quot;, or real
&amp;quot;international sign language,&amp;quot; deaf people
would need to learn at least four languages if
they want to talk to people whose mother
tongue is different from their own: their
mother sign language, their mother spoken
language (as an intermediate language), the
target spoken language, and the sign language
fot the language in which they wish to
communicate. The two spoken languages
become language barriers for deaf people, and
our bilingual dictionary will remove these
barriers. The second describes the use of
computers. As the use of computers becomes
more widespread, it has become more
convenient to study using computer software
and/or the Internet facilities. Our dictionary
system provides deaf people with an easy
means of access using their mother-sign
language so that they don&apos;t have to overcome
the barrier of learning the target-spoken
language. It also provides a way for people
who are going to learn two sign languages to
look up new vocabulary. Further, we plan to
examine how our dictionary system could be
used to educate and assist deaf people.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957975">
Nowadays many deaf people have an
opportunity to study abroad and to learn a foreign
language. But there are three barriers they must
overcome to acquire the target sign language: the
first barrier is their mother-spoken language; the
second is the target-spoken language; and, the last
is the target-sign language.
Generally, deaf people are bilingual since they
have to learn their mother-spoken language and its
sign language. In the United States, many
universities offer American Sign Language(ASL)
as a second foreign language. It is recognized as
an independent languages in the U.S. In Japan,
Japanese Sign Language(JSL) has not yet been
recognized as an independent language.
One of the main purposes of our dictionary is to
remove these language barriers and help deaf
people improve their sign language abilityies based
on their spoken language(Japanese or
English)[Suzuld E., and Kakihana K 20021.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989813">
2.1 American Sign Language (ASL)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791">
American Sign Language (ASL) is a complex
visual—spatial language, used by the deaf
community in the United States and English-
speaking parts of Canada (Nakamura (1)). The
number of ASL users is almost five-hundred
thousand. It is the native language of many
hearing-impaired people, as well as some hearing
children born into deaf families The ASL is
derived from the Native American sign language,
with some words taken from French sign language.
ASL shares no grammatical similarities to
English and should not be considered in any way
to be a broken, mimed, or gestural form of English.
In terms of syntax, for example, ASL uses topic-
comment syntax, while English uses subject-verb-
object.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996194">
2.2 Japanese Sign Language (JSL)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971533333333">
There are two main sign languages in Japan:
&amp;quot;Japanese sign language,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Japanese oral sign
language.&amp;quot; The former is used by deaf people,
and the latter is mainly used by volunteers. It is a
type of pidgin-signed Japanese, often used in
formal situations, lectures, and speeches. The
main difference between the two is the sequence of
the words. Japanese sign language syntax is like
spoken English, using subject-verb-object, whereas
Japanese oral sign language syntax is like spoken
Japanese, using subject-object-verb. In this paper,
since we will only discuss the sign language word
dictionary and not with syntax, we will use the
acronym &amp;quot;JSL&amp;quot; to refer to both Japanese sign
languages.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999437">
2.3 Language Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999604">
As previously mentioned in terms of syntax,
ASL has more in common with spoken Japanese
than with English. For example, in spoken English,
they say &amp;quot;What is your name?&amp;quot; and ASL signs
&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;what&amp;quot;. This word order is identical to
oral Japanese. On the other hand, in JSL, the word
order is &amp;quot;what&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;name&amp;quot; which is more like spoken
English. That is one of the main reasons for us to
focus on ASL as a bilingual dictionary. Another
reason is that ASL is the fourth most commonly
used language in the U.S.A. We assume that it is
easier than learning another sign language for
those who already know Japanese sign language
(JSL) and are planning to learn a second sing
language(Nakamura (2)). Further, according to
some TV programs and newspaper reports, JSL is
becoming more popular among Japanese recently.
Therefore we decided to provide a bilingual
dictionary for those who wish to learn JSL and
ASL.

3 Digital sign language dictionary

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999086">
3.1 The problem of digital sign language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9595314">
Recently many digital dictionaries are available
on the Internet or on CD-ROM. Some of the
electronically accessible bilingual dictionaries and
corpora include: English-French, German-English,
Albanian-Spanish, English-Romanian, Greek-
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.649328" genericHeader="method">
Russian, English-Spanish, English-Russian,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999595846153846">
English-Estonian, English-Hungarian, and
Esperanto-English. These on-line dictionaries are
easy to access by searching an Internet dictionary
site.
Almost all of there digital dictionaries illustrate
signs using cartoon-animations and not human
gestures. We tried to make two types of
dictionaries, and decided that the animations were
more difficult to understand than human gestures
especially by beginners. On the other hand, people
who have been learning the sign language for a
long time might be able to understand animated
sign languages.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998353">
3.2 The purpose of our dictionary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99904636">
Almost all of these digital dictionaries are for the
people who can read and write their mother
language fluently and not for those who have a
disability with their mother tongue. The mother
tongue for those who were born deaf is sign
language, especially for those born into a deaf
family On the other hand, the main language for
those who were born deaf but whose parents are
not deaf is the parents&apos; spoken language. The
problem for these deaf children is that it is difficult
for them to learn their spoken language in their
country. Since their parents use their spoken
language and have become used to using sign
language for their child, a child who is deaf must
learn at least two languages. When they want to or
have to learn a foreign language, the foreign
language becomes the second foreign language.
The target sign language then, becomes their third
one.
Sign language is believed to help those who
want to communicate with people who have
another mother tongue. We think that the second
sign language helps deaf people to communicate
with each other without learning the target-spoken
language.

We believe that our digital dictionary will
remove the bathers for the deaf to learn another
foreign language. The users can choose the
language (Japanese or English) when they want to
search for signed words. They select the word
from their favourite language and just look for it in
the index. Our dictionary shows both Japanese and
American sign languages with moving pictures
taken from three directions.

4 Dictionary Configuration
4.1 Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960006875">
Figure 2 shows our bilingual dictionary
configuration. As you can see, we can search each
sign language using either Japanese or English
words. Thus, we can describe our system as a
quadra-lingual dictionary system. Once you
choose a word, our dictionary will show you the
corresponding Japanese and American sign
languages.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997148">
4.2 Search Flow
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999622428571429">
When this dictionary system starts up, the menu
displays the languages the user can select (Fig. 3).
As shown in Fig. 3, users can select &amp;quot;Exercise&amp;quot;
from the menu after first learning some signs.
Upon the selecting the language, the first
characters of the indices are shown in a
conventional alphabetical arrangement (Fig. 4).

Figure 4. First Characters of Japanaese
Indices
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.997234285714286">
For example, if Japanese is selected, the first
characters of the indices are arranged in dictionary
order (Fig. 4). While using Japanese to search the
dictionary, the user can check the equivalent
English words and ASL. Thus, they can learn
spoken English and ASL simultaneously as shown
in Fig. 5.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.991612">

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999397111111111">
The users can return to the Japanese indices and
English indices just by clicking a button on the
display using their mouse, as shown in Fig. 5. An
example of the English indices that appeared on
the screen is shown in Fig. 6. The resulting screen
is how the screen looks like after the user clicks
&amp;quot;w&amp;quot; for the search word in ASL. Also in Fig.6, you
can see that English words are displayed befpre
Japanese words.

4.3 Applications
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999602625">
We have improved the previous dictionary by
adding an explanation of each sign operation and
providing an example sentence for each word to
enable natural language learnng.
As shown in Figure 7, eight more buttons have
been added to the bilingual sign language display.
Each are explained in Japanese and English and the
example sentences are in Japanese and English.

5 Conclusion and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973296296296">
We have already completed a Japanese sign
language dictionary with SO entries that came from
the JSL dictionary for beginners [Yonaiyama and
Ogata 20011. We also used corresponding
American sign language entries, but some of the
words do not exist. We are planning to add more
Japanese and American sign language motion
pictures. The cross-referenced features in our
dictionary offer students, sign language learners,
and deaf people, a genuine two-language resource
that enhances the opportunity to obtain
communication skills in both modes. We know
that introducing ASL in the English learning
classroom attracts the students&apos; interest and is
effective in learning a foreign language[Pauly, M.,
Miyao M., and Ikeguchi C. 20031. As mentioned
earlier, the word order in ASL is from general to
specific and from large to small, similar to the
Japanese language. This results in easier learning
of each language.
We are currently working to expand our
bilingual dictionary to a courseware dictionary.
We are planning to test it and obtain feedback and
suggestions. At first, we are going to expand it to
conversational sentences, which will help users
identify signs and their meanings within specific
contexts.
