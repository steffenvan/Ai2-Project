Abstract

Although it is generally agreed that Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an ap-
plication dependent task, the great major-
ity of the efforts has aimed at the devel-
opment of WSD systems without consid-
ering their application. We argue that this
strategy is not appropriate, since some
aspects, such as the sense repository and
the disambiguation process itself, vary
according to the application. Taking Ma-
chine Translation (MT) as application
and focusing on the sense repository, we
present evidence for this argument by ex-
amining WSD in English-Portuguese MT
of eight sample verbs. By showing that
the traditional monolingual WSD strate-
gies are not suitable for multilingual ap-
plications, we intend to motivate the de-
velopment of WSD methods for particu-
lar applications.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998516883720931">
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is con-
cerned with the choice of the most appropriate
sense of an ambiguous word given its context.
The applications for which WSD has been
thought to be helpful include Information Re-
trieval, Information Extraction, and Machine
Translation (MT) (Ide and Verónis, 1998). The
usefulness of WSD for MT, particularly, has
been recently subject of debate, with conflicting
results. Vickrey et al. (2005), e.g., show that the
inclusion of a WSD module significantly im-
proves the performance of their statistical MT
system. Conversely, Carpuat and Wu (2005)
found that WSD does not yield significantly bet-
ter translation quality than a statistical MT sys-
tem alone. In this latter work, however, the WSD
module was not specifically designed for MT: it
is based on the use of monolingual methods to
identify the source language senses, which are
then mapped into the target language transla-
tions.
In fact, although it has been agreed that WSD
is more useful when it is meant for a specific ap-
plication (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Kilgarriff,
1997; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997), little has
been done on the development of WSD modules
specifically for particular applications. WSD
models in general are application independent,
and focus on monolingual contexts, particularly
English.
Approaches to WSD as an application-
independent task usually apply standardised
sense repositories, such as WordNet (Miller,
1990). For multilingual applications, a popular
approach is to carry out monolingual WSD and
then map the source language senses into the cor-
responding target word translations (Carpuat and
Wu, 2005; Montoyo et al., 2002). Although this
strategy can yield reasonable results for certain
pairs of languages, especially those which have a
common sense repository, such as EuroWordNet
(Vossen, 1998), mapping senses between lan-
guages is a very complex issue (cf. Section 2).
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999789036363636">
We believe that WSD is an intermediate, applica-
tion dependent task, and thus WSD modules for
particular applications must be developed fol-
lowing the requirements of such applications.
Many key factors of the process are application-
dependent. The main factor is the sense inven-
tory. As emphasized by Kilgarriff (1997), no
sense inventory is suitable for all applications.
Even for the same application there is often little
consensus about the most appropriate sense in-
ventory. For example, the use of WordNet, al-
though very frequent, has been criticized due to
characteristics such as the level sense granularity
and the abstract criteria used for the sense dis-
tinctions in that resource (e.g., Palmer 1998). In
particular, it is generally agreed that the granular-
ity in WordNet is too refined for MT.
In addition to requiring different sense inven-
tories (Hutchins and Somers, 1992), the disam-
biguation process itself often can be varied ac-
cording to the application. For instance, in mono-
lingual WSD, the main information source is the
context of the ambiguous word, that is, the sur-
rounding words in a sentence or paragraph. For
MT purposes, the context can be also that of the
translation in the target language, i.e., words
which have been already translated.
In this paper we focus on the differences in the
sense inventory, contrasting the WordNet inven-
tory for English disambiguation, which was cre-
ated according to psycholinguistics principles,
with the Portuguese translations assigned to a set
of eight verbs in a corpus, simulating MT as a
Computational Linguistics application.
We show that the relation between the number
of senses and translations is not a one-to-one,
and that it is not only a matter of the level of re-
finement of WordNet. The number of transla-
tions can be either smaller or larger, i.e., either
two or more senses can be translated as the same
word, or the same sense can be translated using
different words. With that, we present evidence
that employing a monolingual WSD method for
the task of MT is not appropriate, since monolin-
gual information offers little help to multilingual
disambiguation. In other words, we argue that
multilingual WSD is different from monolingual
WSD, and thus requires specific strategies. We
start by presenting approaches that show cognate
results for different pairs of languages, and also
approaches developed with the reverse goal of
using multilingual information to help monolin-
gual WSD (Section 2). We then present our ex-
periments (Sections 3 and 4) and their results
(Section 5).

Recently, others have also investigated the dif-
ferences between sense repositories for monolin-
gual and multilingual WSD. Chatterjee et al.
(2005), e.g., investigated the ambiguity in the
translation of the English verb “to have” into
Hindi. 11 translation patterns were identified for
the 19 senses of the verb, according to the vari-
ous target syntactic structures and/or target
words for the verb. They argued that differences
in both these aspects do not depend only on the
sense of the verb. Out of the 14 senses analyzed,
six had 2-5 different translations each.
Bentivogli et al. (2004) proposed an approach
to create an Italian sense tagged corpus (Mul-
tiSemCor) based on the transference of the anno-
tations from the English sense tagged corpus
SemCor (Miller et al., 1994), by means of word-
alignment methods. A gold standard corpus was
created by manually transferring senses in Sem-
Cor to the Italian words in a translated version of
that corpus. From a total of 1,054 English words,
155 annotations were considered non-
transferable to their corresponding Italian words,
mainly due to the lack of synonymy at the lexical
level.
Miháltz (2005) manually mapped senses from
the English in a sense tagged corpus to Hungar-
ian translations, in order to carry out WSD be-
tween these languages. Out of 43 ambiguous
nouns, 38 had all or most of their English senses
mapped into the same Hungarian translation.
Some senses of the remaining nouns had to be
split into different Hungarian translations. On
average, the sense mapping decreased the ambi-
guity from 3.97 English senses to 2.49 Hungar-
ian translations.
As we intend to show with this work, differ-
ences like those mentioned above in the sense
inventories make it inappropriate to use mono-
lingual WSD strategies for multilingual disam-
biguation. Nevertheless, some approaches have
successfully employed multilingual information,
especially parallel corpora, to support monolin-
gual WSD. They are motivated by the argument
that the senses of a word should be determined
based on the distinctions that are lexicalized in a
second language (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997).
In general, the assumptions behind these ap-
proaches are the following:
(1) If a source language word is translated dif-
ferently into a second language, it might be am-
biguous and the different translations can indi-
cate the senses in the source language.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998383">
34
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965897959184">
(2) If two distinct source language words are
translated as the same word into a second lan-
guage, it often indicates that the two are being
used with similar senses.
Ide (1999), for example, analyzes translations
of English words into four different languages, in
order to check if the different senses of an Eng-
lish word are lexicalized by different words in all
the other languages. A parallel aligned corpus is
used and the translated senses are mapped into
WordNet senses. She uses this information to
determine a set of monolingual sense distinctions
that is potentially useful for NLP applications. In
subsequent work (Ide et al., 2002), seven lan-
guages and clustering techniques are employed
to create sense groups based on the translations.
Diab and Resnik (2002) use multilingual in-
formation to create an English sense tagged cor-
pus to train a monolingual WSD approach. An
English sense inventory and a parallel corpus
automatically produced by an MT system are
employed. Sentence and word alignment systems
are used to assign the word correspondences be-
tween the two languages. After grouping all the
words that correspond to translations of a single
word in the target language, all their possible
senses are considered as candidates. The sense
that maximizes the semantic similarity of the
word with the others in the group is chosen.
Similarly, Ng et al. (2003) employ English-
Chinese parallel word aligned corpora to identify
a repository of senses for English. The English
word senses are manually defined, based on the
WordNet senses, and then revised in the light of
the Chinese translations. For example, if two oc-
currences of a word with two different senses in
WordNet are translated into the same Chinese
word, they will be considered to have the same
English sense.
In general, these approaches rely on the two
previously mentioned assumptions about the in-
teraction between translations and word senses.
Although these assumptions can be useful when
using cross-language information as an approxi-
mation to monolingual disambiguation, they are
not very helpful in the opposite direction, i.e.,
using monolingual information for cross-
language disambiguation, as we will show in
Section 4.

3 Experimental setting

<bodyText confidence="0.999429923076923">
We focused our experiments on verbs, which
represent difficult cases for WSD. In particular,
we experimented with five frequent and highly
ambiguous verbs identified as problematic for
MT systems in a previous study (Specia, 2005):
“to come”, “to get”, “to give”, “to look”, and “to
make”; and other three frequent verbs that are
not so ambiguous: “to ask”, “to live”, and “to
tell”. The inclusion of the additional verbs allows
us to analyze the effect of the ambiguity level in
the experiment. These verbs will then be trans-
lated into Portuguese so that the resulting transla-
tions can be contrasted to the English senses.

We collected all the sentences containing one of
the eight verbs and their corresponding phrasal
verbs from SemCor, Senseval-2 and Senseval-3

they are both widely used and easily available. In
each of these corpora, ambiguous words are an-
notated with WordNet 2.0 senses. Occurrences
which did not identify a unique sense were not
used. The numbers of sentences selected for each

It is worth mentioning that the phrasal verbs in-
clude simple verb-particle constructions, such as
“give up”, and more complex multi-word expres-
sions, e.g., “get in touch with”, “make up for”,
“come to mind”, etc.
In order to avoid biasing the experiment due to
possible misunderstandings of the verb uses, and
to make the experiment feasible, with a reason-
able number of occurrences to be analyzed, we
selected a subset of the total number of sentences
in Table 1, which were distributed among five
professional English-Portuguese translators (T1,
T2, T3, T4, T5), according to the following crite-
ria:
- The meaning of the verb/phrasal verb in the
context of the sentence should be understandable
and non-ambiguous (for human translators).

- The experiment should be the most compre-
hensive possible, with the largest possible num-
ber of senses for each verb/phrasal.
- Each translator should be given two occur-
rences (when available) of all the distinct senses
of each verb/phrasal verb, in order to make it
possible to contrast different uses of the verb.
- The translators should not be given any in-
formation other than the sentence to select the
translation.
To meet these criteria, a professional translator,
who was not involved in the translation task,
post-processed the selected sentences, filtering
them according to the criteria specified above.
Due to both the scarce number of occurrences of
each phrasal verb sense and the large number of
different phrasal verbs for certain verbs, the post-
selection of phrasal verbs was different from the
post-selection of verbs. In the case of verbs, the
translator scanned the sentences in order to get
10 distinct occurrences of each sense (two for
each translator), eliminating those sentences
which were too complex to understand or used
the verb in an ambiguous way. This process did
not eliminate any senses, and thus did not reduce
the coverage of the experiment. When there were
fewer than 10 occurrences of a given sense, sen-
tences were repeated among translators to guar-
antee that each translator would be given exam-
ples of all the senses of the verb. For instance, if
a sense had only four occurrences, the first two
occurrences were given to T1, T3 and T5, while
the other two occurrences were given to T2 and
T4. If a sense occurred only once for a verb, it
was repeated for all five translators.
For phrasal verbs, the same process was used
to eliminate the complex and ambiguous sen-
tences. Two occurrences (when available) of
each sense of a phrasal verb were then selected.
Due to the large number of different phrasal
verbs for certain verbs, they were divided among
translators, so that each translator was given two
occurrences of only some phrasal verbs of each
verb. Sentences were distributed so that all trans-
lators had a similar number of cases, as shown in
Table 2.
In order to avoid biasing the translations ac-
cording to the English senses, the original sense
annotations were not shown to the translators and
the sentences for each of the verbs, together with
their phrasal verbs, were randomly ordered.
Additionally, we gave the same set of selected
sentences to another group of five translators, so
that we could analyze the reliability of the ex-
periment by investigating the agreement between
the groups of translators on the same data.

As mentioned above, the corpora used are tagged
with WordNet senses. Although this may not be
the optimal sense inventory for many purposes, it
is the best option in terms of availability and
comprehensiveness. Moreover, it is the most fre-
quently used repository for monolingual WSD
systems, making it possible to generalize, to a
certain level, our results to most of the monolin-
gual work. The number of senses for the eight

the number of possible senses, in part because
synonyms are considered as different transla-

eliminate the use of synonyms as possible trans-

translators for our corpus will be considerably
smaller than the total number of possible transla-

4 Contrasting senses and translations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998714166666667">
In order to contrast the English senses with the
Portuguese translations, we submitted the se-
lected sentences (cf. Section 3.1) to two groups
of five translators (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5), all
native speakers of Portuguese. We asked the
translators to assign the appropriate translation to
each of the verb occurrences, which we would
then compare to the original English senses.
They were not told what their translations were
going to be used for.
The translators were provided with entire sen-
tences, but for practical reasons they were asked
to translate only the verb and were allowed to
use any bilingual resource to search for possible
translations, if needed. They were asked to avoid
considering synonyms as different translations.
The following procedure was defined to ana-
lyze the results returned by the translators, for
each verb and its phrasal verbs separately:
1) We grouped all the occurrences of an Eng-
lish sense and looked at all the translations used
by the translators in order to identify synonyms
(in those specific uses), using a dictionary of
Portuguese synonyms. Synonyms were consid-
ered as unique translations.
2) We then analyzed the sentences which had
been given to multiple translators of the same
group (when there were not enough occurrences
of certain senses, as mentioned in Section 3.1), in
order to identify a single translation for the oc-
currence and eliminate redundancies. The trans-
lation chosen was the one pointed out by the ma-
jority of the translators. When it was not possible
to elect only one translation, the n equally most
used were kept, and thus the sentence was re-
peated n times.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9026056">
3) Finally, we examined the relation between
senses and translations, focusing on two cases:
(1) if a sense had only one or many translations;
and (2) if a translation referred to only one or
many senses, i.e., whether the sense was shared
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992313862745098">
by many translations. We placed each sense into
two of the following categories, explained be-
low: (a) or (b), mutually exclusive, representing
the first case; and (c), (d) or (e), also mutually
exclusive, representing the second case.
(a) 1 sense 4 1 translation: all the occur-
rences of the same sense being translated as
the same Portuguese word. For example, “to
ask”, in the sense of “inquire, enquire”, is al-
ways translated as “perguntar”.
(b) 1 sense 4 n translations: different oc-
currences of the same sense being translated as
different, non-synonyms, Portuguese words.
For example, “to look”, in the sense of “per-
ceive with attention; direct one&apos;s gaze to-
wards” can be translated as “olhar”, “assistir”,
and “voltar-se”.
(c) n senses 4 1 translation (ambiguous):
Different senses of a word being translated as
the same Portuguese word, which encom-
passes all the English senses. For example,
“make”, in the sense of “engage in”, “create”,
and “give certain properties to something”, is
translated as “fazer”, which carries the three
senses.
(d) n senses 4 1 translation (non-
ambiguous): different senses of a word being
translated using the same Portuguese word,
which has only one sense. For example, “take
advantage” in both the senses of “draw advan-
tages from” and “make excessive use of”, be-
ing translated as “aproveitar-se”.
(e) n senses 4 n translations: different
senses of a word being translated as different
Portuguese words. For example, the “move
fast” and “carry out a process or program”
senses of the verb “run” being translated re-
spectively as “correr” and “executar”.
Items (a) and (e) represent cases where multilin-
gual ambiguity only reflects the monolingual
one, that is, to all the occurrences of every sense
of an English word corresponds a specific Portu-
guese translation. On the other hand, items (b),
(c) and (d) provide evidence that multilingual
ambiguity is different from monolingual ambigu-
ity. Item (b) means that different criteria are
needed for the disambiguation, as ambiguity
arises only during the translation, due to specific
principles used to distinguish senses in Portu-
guese. Items (c) and (d) mean that disambigua-
tion is not necessary, as either the Portuguese

Table 4 presents the number of different sen-
tences analyzed for each of the verbs (after
grouping and eliminating the repeated sen-
tences), the English (E) senses and (non-
synonyms) Portuguese (P) translations in our
corpus, followed by the percentage of occur-
rences of each of the categories outlined in Sec-
tion 4 (a – e) with respect to the number of
senses (# Senses) for that verb. Items (c) and (d)
were grouped, since for practical purposes it is
not important to tell if the P word translating the
various E senses encompasses one or many
senses. For items (b) and (c&amp;d) we also present
the average of P translations per E sense ((b) av-
erage), and the average of E senses per P transla-
tion, respectively ((c&amp;d) average).
We divided the analysis of these results ac-
cording to our two cases (cf. Section 4): the first
covers items (c&amp;d) and (e) (light grey in Table
4), while the second covers items (a) and (b)
(dark grey in Table 4).
1) Items (c), (d) and (e): n senses → ? transla-
tion(s)
The number of senses in the corpus is almost
always greater than the number of translations,
suggesting that the level of sense distinctions in
WordNet can be too fine-grained for translation
applications The numbers of senses and transla-
tions are in an opposite relation comparing to the
one shown in Table 3, where the number of pos-
sible translations was larger than the number of
possible senses. This shows that indeed many of
the possible translations are synonyms.
On average, the level of ambiguity decreased
from 40.3 (possible senses) to 24.4 (possible
translations), if the monolingual and multilingual
ambiguity are compared in the corpus. If we con-
sider the five most ambiguous verbs, the level of
ambiguity decreased from 58.8 to 35. For the
other three less ambiguous verbs, the level of
ambiguity decreased from 9.3 to 6.7.
Column % (c&amp;d) shows the percentage of
senses, with respect to the total shown in the
third column (# Senses), which share translations
with other senses. A shared translation means
that several senses of the verb have the same
translation. (c&amp;d) average indicates the average
number of E senses per P translation, for those
cases where translations are shared. For all verbs,
on average translations cover more than two
senses. The level of variation in the number of
shared translations among senses is high, e.g.,
from 2 (translation = “organizar”) to 27 (transla-
tion = “dar”) for the verb “to give”. Contrasting
the percentage of senses that share translations,
in % (c), with the percentages in % (d), which
refers to the senses for which translations are not
shared, we can see that the great majority of
senses have translations in common with other
senses, and thus the disambiguation among these
senses would not be necessary in most of the
cases. In fact, it could result in errors, since an
incorrect sense could be chosen.
2) Items (a) and (b): 1 sense → ? translation(s)
As previously mentioned, the differences in the
sense inventory for monolingual and multilingual
WSD are not only due to the fact that sense dis-
tinctions in WordNet are too refined. That would
only indicate that using monolingual WSD for
multilingual purposes implies unnecessary work.
However, we consider that the most important
problem is the one evidenced by item (b) in the
sixth column in Table 4. For all the verbs except
“to ask” (the least ambiguous), there were cases
in which different occurrences of the same sense
were translated into different, non-synonyms
words. Although the proportion of senses with
only one translation is greater, as shown by item
(a) in the fifth column, the percentage of senses
with more than one translation is impressive,
especially for the five most ambiguous verbs. In
face of this, the lack of disambiguation of a word
during translation based on the fact that the word
is not ambiguous in the source language can re-
sult in very serious translation errors when
monolingual methods are employed for multilin-
gual WSD. Therefore, this also shows that, for
these verbs, sense inventories that are specific to
the translation between the pair of languages un-
der consideration would be more appropriate to
achieve effective WSD.

In an attempt to quantify the agreement between
the two groups of translators, we computed the
Kappa coefficient for annotation tasks, as de-
fined by Carletta (1996). Kappa was calculated
separately for our two areas of inquiry, i.e., cases

verb was or was not shared by other senses. For
example, both groups agreed that the word
“fazer” should be used to translate occurrences
of many senses of the verb “to make”, including
“engage in”, “give certain properties to some-
thing”, and “make or cause to be or to become”.
On the other hand, the groups disagreed about
the sense “go off or discharge” of the phrasal
verb “to go off”: the first group found that the
translation of that sense, “disparar”, did not refer
to any other sense, while the second group used
that word to translate also the sense “be dis-
charged or activated” of the same phrasal verb.
In the experiment with case (2), groups were
considered to agree about a sense if they both
judged that the sense had or had not more than
one translation. For example, both groups agreed
that the sense “reach a state, relation, or condi-
tion” of the verb “to come” should be translated
by more than one Portuguese word, including
“terminar”, “vir”, and “chegar”. They also
agreed that the sense “move toward, travel to-
ward something or somebody or approach some-
thing or somebody” of the same verb had only
one translation, namely “vir”.
The average Kappa coefficient obtained was
0.66 for item (1), and 0.65 for item (2). There is
not a reference value for this particular annota-
tion task (translation annotation), but the levels
of agreement pointed by Kappa here can be con-
sidered satisfactory. The agreement levels are
close to the coefficient suggested by Carletta as
indicative of a good agreement level for dis-
course annotation (0.67), and which has been
adopted as a cutoff in Computational Linguistics.

6 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999475">
We presented experiments contrasting monolin-
gual and multilingual WSD. It was found that, in
fact, monolingual and multilingual disambigua-
tion differ in many respects, particularly the
sense repository, and therefore specific strategies
could be more appropriate to achieve effective
multilingual WSD. We investigated the differ-
ences in sense repositories considering English-
Portuguese translation, using a set of eight am-
biguous verbs collected from sentences in Sem-
Cor and Senseval corpora. The English sense
tags given by WordNet were compared to the
Portuguese translations assigned by two groups
of five human translators.
Results corroborate previous cognate work,
showing that there is not a one-to-one mapping
between the English senses and their translations
(to Portuguese, in this study). In most of the
cases, many different senses were translated into
the same Portuguese word. In many other cases,
different, non-synonymous, words were neces-
sary to translate occurrences of the same sense of
the source language, showing that differences
between monolingual and multilingual WSD are
not only a matter of the highly refined sense dis-
tinction criterion adopted in WordNet. Therefore,
these results reinforce our argument that apply-
ing monolingual methods for multilingual WSD
can either imply unnecessary work, or result in
disambiguation errors.
As future work we plan to carry out further in-
vestigation of the differences between monolin-
gual and multilingual WSD contrasting the Eng-
lish senses and translations into other languages,
and analyzing other grammatical categories, par-
ticularly nouns.

<abstract confidence="0.997492142857143">Although it is generally agreed that Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an application dependent task, the great majority of the efforts has aimed at the development of WSD systems without considering their application. We argue that this strategy is not appropriate, since some aspects, such as the sense repository and the disambiguation process itself, vary according to the application. Taking Machine Translation (MT) as application and focusing on the sense repository, we present evidence for this argument by examining WSD in English-Portuguese MT of eight sample verbs. By showing that the traditional monolingual WSD strategies are not suitable for multilingual applications, we intend to motivate the development of WSD methods for particular applications.</abstract>

The applications for which WSD has been thought to be helpful include Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, and Machine Translation (MT) (Ide and Verónis, 1998). The usefulness of WSD for MT, particularly, has been recently subject of debate, with conflicting results. Vickrey et al. (2005), e.g., show that the inclusion of a WSD module significantly improves the performance of their statistical MT system. Conversely, Carpuat and Wu (2005) found that WSD does not yield significantly better translation quality than a statistical MT system alone. In this latter work, however, the WSD module was not specifically designed for MT: it is based on the use of monolingual methods to identify the source language senses, which are then mapped into the target language translations. In fact, although it has been agreed that WSD is more useful when it is meant for a specific application (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Kilgarriff, 1997; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997), little has been done on the development of WSD modules specifically for particular </context>

As emphasized by Kilgarriff (1997), no sense inventory is suitable for all applications. Even for the same application there is often little consensus about the most appropriate sense inventory. For example, the use of WordNet, although very frequent, has been criticized due to characteristics such as the level sense granularity and the abstract criteria used for the sense distinctions in that resource (e.g., Palmer 1998). In particular, it is generally agreed that the granularity in WordNet is too refined for MT. In addition to requiring different sense inventories (Hutchins and Somers, 1992), the disambiguation process itself often can be varied according to the application. For instance, in monolingual WSD, the main information source is the context of the ambiguous word, that is, the surrounding words in a sentence or paragraph. For MT purposes, the context can be also that of the translation in the target language, i.e., words which have been already translated.

An English sense inventory and a parallel corpus automatically produced by an MT system are employed.

Conversely, Carpuat and Wu (2005) found that WSD does not yield significantly better translation quality than a statistical MT system alone. In this latter work, however, the WSD module was not specifically designed for MT: it is based on the use of monolingual methods to identify the source language senses, which are then mapped into the target language translations. In fact, although it has been agreed that WSD is more useful when it is meant for a specific application (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Kilgarriff, 1997; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997), little has been done on the development of WSD modules specifically for particular applications.

Many key factors of the process are applicationdependent. The main factor is the sense inventory. As emphasized by Kilgarriff (1997), no sense inventory is suitable for all applications. Even for the same application there is often little consensus about the most appropriate sense inventory. For example, the use of WordNet, although very frequent, has been criticized due to characteristics such as the level sense granularity and the abstract criteria used for the sense distinctions in that resource (e.g., Palmer 1998). In particular, it is generally agreed that the granularity in WordNet is too refined for MT. In addition to requiring different sense inventories (Hutchins and Somers, 1992), the disambiguation process itself often can be varied according to the application. For instance, in monolingual WSD, the main information source is the context of the ambiguous word, that is, the surrounding words in a sentence or paragraph. For MT purposes, the context can be also that of the translation in the target language, i.e., words which have been already translated. In this paper we focus on the differences i</context>

As we intend to show with this work, differences like those mentioned above in the sense inventories make it inappropriate to use monolingual WSD strategies for multilingual disambiguation. Nevertheless, some approaches have successfully employed multilingual information, especially parallel corpora, to support monolingual WSD. They are motivated by the argument that the senses of a word should be determined based on the distinctions that are lexicalized in a second language (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997). In general, the assumptions behind these approaches are the following: (1) If a source language word is translated differently into a second language, it might be ambiguous and the different translations can indicate the senses in the source language. 34 (2) If two distinct source language words are translated as the same word into a second language, it often indicates that the two are being used with similar senses.

Although these assumptions can be useful when using cross-language information as an approximation to monolingual disambiguation, they are not very helpful in the opposite direction, i.e., using monolingual information for crosslanguage disambiguation, as we will show in Section 4. 3 Experimental setting We focused our experiments on verbs, which represent difficult cases for WSD. In particular, we experimented with five frequent and highly ambiguous verbs identified as problematic for MT systems in a previous study (Specia, 2005): “to come”, “to get”, “to give”, “to look”, and “to make”; and other three frequent verbs that are not so ambiguous: “to ask”, “to live”, and “to tell”. The inclusion of the additional verbs allows us to analyze the effect of the ambiguity level in the experiment. These verbs will then be translated into Portuguese so that the resulting translations can be contrasted to the English senses. 3.1 Corpus selection We collected all the sentences containing one of the eight verbs and their corresponding phrasal verbs from SemCor, Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 corpora1.

The applications for which WSD has been thought to be helpful include Information Retrieval, Information Extraction, and Machine Translation (MT) (Ide and Verónis, 1998). The usefulness of WSD for MT, particularly, has been recently subject of debate, with conflicting results. Vickrey et al.
