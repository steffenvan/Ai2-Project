This paper is a progress report on a project in linguistically
based automatic speech recognition, The domain of this project
is English intonation. The system I will describe analyzes
fundamental frequency contours (F0 contours) of speech in
terms of the theory of melody laid out in Pierrehumbert (1980).
Experiments discussed in Liberman and Pierrehumbert (1983)
support the assumptions made about intonational phonetics, and
an FO synthesis program based on a precursor to the present
theory is described in Pierrehumbert (1981).
One aim of the project is to investigate the descriptive adequacy
of this theory of English melody. A second motivation is to
characterize cases where FO may provide useful information
about stress and phrasing. The third, and to my mind the most
important, motivation depends on the observation that English
intonation is in itself a small language, complete with a syntax
and phonetics. Building a recognizer for this small language is a
relatively tractable problem which still presents some of the
interesting features of the general speech recognition problem.
In particular, the FO contour, like other measurements of
speech, is a continuously varying time function without overt
segmentation. Its transcription is in terms of a sequence of
discrete elements whose relation to the quantitative level of
description is not transparent. An analysis of a contour thus
relates heterogeneous levels of description, one quantitative and
one symbolic. In developing speech recognizers, we wish to
exploit achievements in symbolic computation. At the same

time, we wish to avoid forcing into a symbolic framework
properties which could more insightfully or simply be treated as
quantitative. In the case of intonation, our experimental results
suggest both a division of labor between these two levels of
description, and principles for their interaction.
The next section of this paper sketches the theory of English
intonation on which the recognizer is based. Comparisons to
other proposals in the literature are not made here, but can be
found in the papers just cited. The third section describes a
preliminary implementation. The fourth contains discussion and
conclusions.

The primitives in the theory are two tones, low (L) and high
(H). The distinction between L and H is papdigmatic; that is,
L is lower than H would be in the same context. It can easily be
treated as a distinction in a single binary valued feature.
Utterances consist of one or more intonation phrases. The
melody of an intonation phrase is decomposed into a sequence of
elements, each made up of either one or two tones. Some are
associated with stressed syllables, and others with the beginning
and end of the phrase. Superficially global characteristics of
phrasal FO contours are explicated in terms of the concatenation
of these local elements.

The characteristic FO configurations on stressed syllables are due
to pitch accents, which consist of either a single tone or a
sequence of two tones. For example, each peak circled in Figure
I is attributed to a H pitch accent. The steps circled in Figure 2
are analyzed as I-14-L, because they have a relatively higher
level just before the stress and a relatively lower level on the
stress. In two tone accents, which tone falls on the stress is
distinctive, and will be transcribed with a *. In this notation,
the circled accents in Figure 2 are H+La. Seven different
accents are posited altogether. Some possible accents do not
occur because they would be neutralized in every context by the
realization rules. Different types of pitch accents can be mixed

in one phrase. Also, material which is presupposed in the
discourse may be unaccented. In this case, the surrounding tonal
elements control its FO contour.
The tonal correlates of phrasing are the boundary tones, which
control the FO at the onset and offset of the phrase, and an
additional element, the phrase accent, which controls the FO
between the last pitch accent and the final phrase boundary. The
boundary tones and the phrase accent are all single tones, either
L or H. In what follows, a &amp;quot;%&amp;quot; will be used as the diacritic for a
boundary tone. Figure 3 shows two pitch contours in which a L
phrase accent is followed by a H% boundary tone. When the last
pitch accent is early in the phrase, as in 3A, the level of the
phrase accent is maintained over a fairly long segmental string
(&amp;quot;doesn&apos;t think&amp;quot;). In 38, on the other hand, the pitch accent,
phrase accent, and boundary tone have all been compressed onto
a single syllable.
As far as is known, different pitch accents, phrase accents, and
boundary tones combine freely with each other. This means that
Figure Both of these contours have a L&amp;quot;+H accent followed
by a L phrase accent and a H% boundary tone. In 3A, the
accent is on &amp;quot;father-in-law&amp;quot;, and the L H% sequence determines
the FO contour on the rest of the utterance. The alignment of
the speech segments with the FO contour is roughly indicated by
the placement of lettering. In 38, L&amp;quot;+H L H% is compressed
onto a monosyllable.

the grammar of English phrasal melodies can be represented by
a transition network, as shown in Figure 4. This grammar
defines the level of description that the recognizer attempts to
recover. There is no effort to characterize the meaning of the
transcriptions established, since our focus is on the sound
structure of speech rather than its meaning. In production, the
choice of loci for pitch accents depends on the focus structure of
the sentence. The choice among different melodic elements
appears to be controlled by the attitudes of the speaker and the
relation of his phrase to others in the discourse. Meanings
suggested in the literature for such elements include surprise,
contradiction, elicitation, and judiciousness.

<bodyText confidence="0.999992760869565">
Two types of rules have a part in relating the tonal level of
description to the continuously varying FO contour. One set of
rules maps tones into crucial points, or targets, in the FO
contour. Both the small tonal inventory and the sequential
decomposition proposed depend on these rules being nontrivial.
Specifically, a rule of downstep lowers a H tone in the contexts
H+L and H L+_. The value of the downstepped H is a
fixed fraction of the value for the preceding H, once a phrasal
constant reflecting pitch range is subtracted. Iterative
application of this rule in a sequence of accents which meet its
structural description generates an exponential decay to a
nonzero asymptote. A related rule, upstep, raises a H% after a
H phrase accent. This means that the L• H H% melody often
used in yes/no questions (and illustrated in Figure 5 below)
takes the form of a rise--plateau--rise in the FO contour.
Differences in the relative level of accent tones can also result
from differences in the emphasis on the material they are
associated with. This is why the middle H• in Figure 1 is lower
than the other two, for example.
A second class of rules computes transitions between one target
and the next. These fill in the FO contour, and are responsible
for the FO on syllables which carry no tone. Transitions are not
always monotonic; in Figure I. for example, the FO dips between
each pair of H &apos;accents. Such dipping can be found between two
targets which are above the low part of the range. Its extent
seems to depend on the time-frequency separation of the targets.
In certain circumstances, a single tone gives rise to a flat stretch
in the FO contour. For example, the phrase accent in Figure 3A
has spread over two words. This phenomenon could be treated
either at a phonological level, by linking the tone to a large
number of syllables, or at a phonetic level, by positing a
sustained style of transition. There are some interesting
theoretical points here, but they do not seem to affect the design
of an intonation recognizer.
Note that the rules just described all operate in a small window,
as defined on the sequence of tonal units. To a good
approximation, the realization of a given tonal element can be
computed without look-ahead, and looking back no further than
the previous one. Of course, the window size could never be
stated so simply with respect to the segmental string; two pitch
accents could, for example, be squeezed onto adjacent syllables
or separated by many syllables. One of the crucial assumptions
of the work, taken from autosegmental and metrical phonology,
is that the tonal string can be projected off the segmental string.
The recognition system will make strong use of the locality
constraint that this projection makes possible.

2.3 Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999570625">
The major theoretical innovations of the description just
sketched have important computational consequences. The
theory has only two tones, L and H. whereas earlier tone-level
theories had four. In combination with expressive variation in
pitch range, a four tone system has too many degrees of freedom
for a transcription to be recoverable, in general, from the FO
contour. Reducing the inventory to two tones raises the hope of
reducing the level of ambiguity to that ordinarily found in
natural language. The claim that implementation rules for tonal
elements are local mean that the quantitative evidence for the
occurrence of a particular element is confined to a particular
area of the FO contour. This constraint will be used to simplify
the control structure. A third claim, that phrasal tunes are
constructed syntactically from a small number of elements,
means that standard parsing methods are applicable to the
recognition problem.

errors and minimizing the effects of the speech segments. Then,
a schematization in terms of events is established, by finding
crucial features of the smoothed contour through analysis of the
derivatives. Events are the interface between the quantitative
and symbolic levels of description; they are discrete and
relatively sparse with respect to the original contour, but carry
with them relevant quantitative information. Parsing of events is
carried out top down, with the aid of rules for matching the
tonal elements to event sequences. Tonal elements may account
for variable numbers of events, and different analyses of an
ambiguous contour may divide up the event stream in different
ways. Steps in the analysis of an example FO contour are shown
in Figure 5.

3.1 Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994176962962963">
The input to the system is an FO contour computed by the Gold
Rabiner algorithm (Gold and Rabiner, 1969). Two difficulties
with this input make it unsuitable for immediate prosodic
analysis. First, the pitch tracker in some cases returns values
which are related to the true values by an integer multiplier or
divisor. These stray values are fatal to any prosodic analysis if
they survive in the input to the smoothing of the contour. This
problem is addressed by imposing continuity constraints on the
FO contour. When a stray value is located, an attempt to find a
multiplier or divisor which will bring it into line is made, and if
this attempt fails, the stray value is deleted. In our -experience,
such continuity constraints are necessary to eliminate sporadic
errors; without them, no amount of parameter tweaking suffices.
A second problem arises because the speech segments perturb
the FO contour; here, consonantal effects are of particular
concern. There are no FO values during voiceless segments.
Glottal stops and voiced obstruents depress the FO on both sides.
In addition, voiceless obstruents raise the FO at the beginning of
a following vowel. Because of these effects, a attempt was made
Figure 5: Panel A shows an unprocessed FO contour. The
placement of lettering indicates roughly the alignment of tune
and text. Parts of the FO contour which survive the continuity
constraints and the clipping are drawn with a heavier line.
Panel B shows the connected and smoothed FO contour, together
with its event characterization. The two transcriptions of the
contour are shown underneath. The alignment of tonal elements
indicates what events each covers.

to remove FO values in the immediate vicinity of obstruents. An
adapted version of the Fleck and Liberman (1982) syllable peak
finder controlled this clipping. Our modification worked outward
from the syllabic peaks to find sonorant regions, and then
retained the FO values found there. In Figure 5A, the portions
of the FO contour remaining after this procedure are indicated
by a heavier line. The retained portions of the contour are
connected by linear interpolation. Following Hildreth and Marr&apos;s
work on vision, the connected contour is smoothed by
convolution with a Gaussian in order to permit analysis of the
derivatives. The smoothed contour for the example is shown in
Figure 5B.

3.2 Schematization

<bodyText confidence="0.999989588235294">
Events in the contour are found by analysis of the first and
second derivatives. The events of ultimate interest are maxima,
minima, plateaus, and points of inflection. Roughly speaking,
peaks correspond to H tones, some valleys are L tones, and
points of inflection can arise through downstep, upstep, or a
disparity in prominence between adjacent H accents. Plateaus,
or level parts of the contour, can arise from tone spreading or
from a sequence of two like tones. Events are implemented as
structures which store quantitative information, such as location,
FO value, and derivative values.
Maxima and minima can be located as zeroes in the first
derivative. Those which exhibit insufficient contrast with their
local environment are suppressed; in regions of little change,
such as that covered by the phrase accent in Figure 3A, this
threshholding prevents minor fluctuations from being treated as
prosodic. Plateaus are significant stretches of the contour which
are as good as level. A plateau is created from a sequence of low
contrast maxima and minima, or from a very broad peak or
valley. In either case, the boundaries of the plateau are marked
with events, whose type is relevant to the ultimate tonal analysis.
These events are not located at absolute maxima or minima,
which in nearly level stretches may fall a fair distance from
points of prosodic significance. Instead, they are pushed outward
to a near-maximum, or a near-minimum. The event locations in
Figure 5B reflect this adjustment. Minima in the absolute slope,
(which form a subset of zero crossings in the second derivative)
are retained as points of inflection if they contrast sufficiently in
slope with the slope maxima on either side. In some cases, such
points were engendered by smoothing from places where the
original contour had a shelf. In many others, however, the
shoulder in the original contour is a slope minimum, although a
more prototypical realization of the same prosodic pattern would
have a shelf. Presumably, this fact is due to the low pass
characteristics of the articulatory system itself.

3.3 Parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989470588236">
Tonal analysis of the event stream is carried out by a topdown
nondeterministic finite state parser, assisted by a set of
verification rules. The grammar is a close relative of the
transition network in Figure I. (There is no effort to make
distinctions which would require independent information about
stress location, and provision is made for the case where the
phrase accent and boundary tone collapse phonetically.) The
verification rules relate tonal elements to sequences of events in
the FO contour. As each tonal element is hypothesized, it is
checked against the event stream to see whether it plausibly
extends the analysis hypothesized so far. The integration of
successful local hypotheses into complete analyses is handled
conventionally (see Woods 1973).
The ontology of the verification rules is based on our
understanding of the phonetic realization rules for tonal
elements. Each rule characterizes the realization of a particular
element or class of elements, given the immediate left context.
Wider contexts are unnecessary, because the realization rules
are claimed to be local. Correct management of chained
computations, such as iterative downsteps, falls out
automatically from the control structure. The verification rules
refer both to the event types (e.g. &amp;quot;maximum&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;inflection,&amp;quot;) and
to values of a small vocabulary of predicates describing
quantitative characteristics. The present system has five
predicates, though a more detailed accounting of the FO contour
would require a few more. One returns a verdict on whether an
event is in the correct relation to a preceding event to be
considered downstepped. Another determines whether a
minimum might be explained by a non-monotonic FO transition,
like that pointed out in Figure I. In general, relations between
crucial points are considered, rather than their absolute values.
Even for a single speaker, absolute values are not very relevant
to melodic analysis, because of expressive variation in pitch
range. Our experiments showed that local relations, when stated
correctly, are much more stable.
Timing differences result in multiple realizations for some tonal
sequences. For example, the I.,* H H% sequence in Figure 5A
comes out as a rise--plateau--rise. If the same sequence were
compressed onto less segmental material, one would see a rise--
inflection--rise, or even a single large rise. For this reason, the
rules OR several ways of accepting a given tonal hypothesis. As
just indicated, these can involve different numbers of events.
The transcription under figure 5B indicates the two analyses
returned by the system. Note that they differ in the total
number of tonal elements, and in the number of events covered
by the H phrase accent. The first analysis correctly reflects the
speaker&apos;s intention. The second is consistent with the shape of
the FO contour, but would require a different phrasal stress
pattern. Thus the location of the phrasal stress cannot be
uniquely recovered from the FO contour, although analysis of the
FO does constrain the possibilities.

</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.90377">
4.1 Intellectual antecedents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999719842105263">
The work described here has been greatly influenced by the
work of Marr and his collaborators on vision. The
schematization of the FO contour has a family resemblance to
their primal sketch, and I follow their suggestion that analysis of
the derivatives, iS a useful step in making such a schematization.
Lea (1979) argues that stressed syllables and phrase boundaries
can be located by setting a threshhold on FO changes. This
procedure uses no representation of different melodic types,
which are the main object of interest here. Its assumptions are
commonly met, but break down in many perfectly well-formed
English intonation patterns.
Vives et al. (1977) use FO in French to screen lexical
hypotheses, by placing restrictions on the location of word
boundaries. This procedure is motivated by the observation that
the FO contour constrains but does not uniquely determine the
boundary locations. In English, FO does not mark word
boundaries, but there are somewhat comparable situations in
which it constrains but does not determine an analysis of how
the utterance is organized. However, the English prosodic

system is much more complex than that of French, and so an
implementation of this idea is accordingly more difficult.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.934129">
4.2 Segmentation and labelling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993448275862">
The approach to segmentation used here contrasts strongly with
that used in the past in phonemic analysis. Whereas the HWIM
system, for example, proposed segmental boundaries bottom up
(Woods et al., 1976), the system described here never
establishes boundaries. For example, there is no point on the rise
between a L* and a H&amp;quot; which is ever designated as the
boundary between the two pitch accents. Whereas phonetic
segments ordinarily carry only categorical information, the
events found here are hybrids, with both categorical and
quantitative information. A kind of soft segmentation comes
out, in the sense that a particular tonal element accounts for
some particular sequence of events. Study of ambiguous
contours indicates that this grouping of events cannot be carried
out separately from labelling. Thus, there is no stage of analysis
where the contour is segmented, even in this soft sense, but not
labelled.
It is not hard to find examples suggesting that the approach
taken here is also relevant for phonemic analysis. Consider the
word &amp;quot;joy&amp;quot;, shown in Figure 6. Here, the second Formant falls
from the palatal locus to a back vowel position, and then rises
again for the off-glide. A different transcription involving two
syllables might also be hypothesized; the second formant could
be falling through a rather nondistinct vowel into a vocalized
/1/, and then rising for a front vowel. Thus, we can only
establish the correct segment count for this word by evaluating
the hypothesis of a medial /I/. Even having done so, there is no
argument for boundary locations. The multiple pass strategy
used in the 1-IW1M system appears to have been aimed at such
problems, but does not really get at their root.

4.3 Problems

<bodyText confidence="0.93151425">
A number of defects in the current implementation have become
apparent. In the example, the amount of clipping and smoothing
needed to suppress segmental effects enough for parsing results
in poor time alignment of the second transcription. The H* in
this analysis is assigned to &amp;quot;source&amp;quot;, whereas the researcher
looking at the raw FO contour would be inclined to put it on
&amp;quot;gumes&amp;quot;. In general, curves which are too smooth may still be

insufficiently smooth to parse. An alternative approach based on
Hildreth&apos;s suggestions about integration of different scale
channels in vision was also investigated. (Hildreth, 1980.) Most
of the obstacles she mentions were actually encountered, and no
way was found to surmount them. Thus, I view the separation
of segmental and prosodic effects on FO as an open problem.
Adding verification rules for segmental effects appears to be the
most promising course.
Two classes of extraneous analyses generated by the system
merit discussion. Some analyses, such as the second in Figure 5,
violate the stress pattern. These are of interest, because they
inform us about how much FO by itself constrains the
interpretation of stress. A second group, namely analyses which
have too many tonal elements for the syllable count, is of less
interest. A future implementation should eliminate these by
referring to syllable peak locations.

Parsing of events is carried out top down, with the aid of rules for matching the tonal elements to event sequences. Tonal elements may account for variable numbers of events, and different analyses of an ambiguous contour may divide up the event stream in different ways. Steps in the analysis of an example FO contour are shown in Figure 5. 3.1 Preprocessing The input to the system is an FO contour computed by the Gold Rabiner algorithm (Gold and Rabiner, 1969). Two difficulties with this input make it unsuitable for immediate prosodic analysis. First, the pitch tracker in some cases returns values which are related to the true values by an integer multiplier or divisor. These stray values are fatal to any prosodic analysis if they survive in the input to the smoothing of the contour. This problem is addressed by imposing continuity constraints on the FO contour. When a stray value is located, an attempt to find a multiplier or divisor which will bring it into line is made, and if this attempt fails, the stray value is deleted. In our -experience, s</context>

Thus the location of the phrasal stress cannot be uniquely recovered from the FO contour, although analysis of the FO does constrain the possibilities. 4. Discussion and conclusions 4.1 Intellectual antecedents The work described here has been greatly influenced by the work of Marr and his collaborators on vision. The schematization of the FO contour has a family resemblance to their primal sketch, and I follow their suggestion that analysis of the derivatives, iS a useful step in making such a schematization. Lea (1979) argues that stressed syllables and phrase boundaries can be located by setting a threshhold on FO changes. This procedure uses no representation of different melodic types, which are the main object of interest here. Its assumptions are commonly met, but break down in many perfectly well-formed English intonation patterns. Vives et al. (1977) use FO in French to screen lexical hypotheses, by placing restrictions on the location of word boundaries. This procedure is motivated by the observation that the FO contour constrains but does not uniquely determine the boundary locations. In English, F</context>

Introduction This paper is a progress report on a project in linguistically based automatic speech recognition, The domain of this project is English intonation. The system I will describe analyzes fundamental frequency contours (F0 contours) of speech in terms of the theory of melody laid out in Pierrehumbert (1980). Experiments discussed in Liberman and Pierrehumbert (1983) support the assumptions made about intonational phonetics, and an FO synthesis program based on a precursor to the present theory is described in Pierrehumbert (1981). One aim of the project is to investigate the descriptive adequacy of this theory of English melody. A second motivation is to characterize cases where FO may provide useful information about stress and phrasing. The third, and to my mind the most important, motivation depends on the observation that English intonation is in itself a small language, complete with a syntax and phonetics. Building a recognizer for this small language is a relatively tractable problem which still presents some of the interesting features of the general speech recognition problem. In particular, the FO contour, l</context>

(There is no effort to make distinctions which would require independent information about stress location, and provision is made for the case where the phrase accent and boundary tone collapse phonetically.) The verification rules relate tonal elements to sequences of events in the FO contour. As each tonal element is hypothesized, it is checked against the event stream to see whether it plausibly extends the analysis hypothesized so far. The integration of successful local hypotheses into complete analyses is handled conventionally (see Woods 1973). The ontology of the verification rules is based on our understanding of the phonetic realization rules for tonal elements. Each rule characterizes the realization of a particular element or class of elements, given the immediate left context. Wider contexts are unnecessary, because the realization rules are claimed to be local. Correct management of chained computations, such as iterative downsteps, falls out automatically from the control structure. The verification rules refer both to the event types (e.g. &amp;quot;maximum&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;inflection,&amp;quot;) and to values of a small vocabulary of predicates describi</context>

In English, FO does not mark word boundaries, but there are somewhat comparable situations in which it constrains but does not determine an analysis of how the utterance is organized. However, the English prosodic 89 system is much more complex than that of French, and so an implementation of this idea is accordingly more difficult. 4.2 Segmentation and labelling The approach to segmentation used here contrasts strongly with that used in the past in phonemic analysis. Whereas the HWIM system, for example, proposed segmental boundaries bottom up (Woods et al., 1976), the system described here never establishes boundaries. For example, there is no point on the rise between a L* and a H&amp;quot; which is ever designated as the boundary between the two pitch accents. Whereas phonetic segments ordinarily carry only categorical information, the events found here are hybrids, with both categorical and quantitative information. A kind of soft segmentation comes out, in the sense that a particular tonal element accounts for some particular sequence of events. Study of ambiguous contours indicates that this grouping of events cannot be carried out separately from labelli</context>
