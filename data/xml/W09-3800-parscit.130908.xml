Welcome to the Eleventh International Conference on Parsing Technologies, IWPT’09, in the splendid
city of Paris.
IWPT’09 continues the tradition of biennial conferences on parsing technology organized by SIGPARSE,
the Special Interest Group on Parsing of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The first
conference, in 1989, took place in Pittsburgh and Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania. Subsequently, IWPT
conferences were held in Cancun (Mexico) in 1991; Tilburg (Netherlands) and Durbuy (Belgium) in
1993; Prague and Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) in 1995; Boston/Cambridge (Massachusetts) in 1997;
Trento (Italy) in 2000; Beijing (China) in 2001; Nancy (France) in 2003; Vancouver (Canada) in 2005;
and Prague (Czech Republic) in 2007.
Over the years the IWPT Workshops have become the major forum for researchers in natural language
parsing. They have lead to the publication of four books on parsing technologies; a fifth one about to be
published.
Where the IWPT conferences from 1989 through 2003 were standalone conferences, the last two IWPTs
were organised as co-satellite event of large conferences: IWPT 2005 was co-loated with the HLT-
EMNLP conference in Vancouver, and IWPT 2007 with the main ACL conference in Prague. This
worked well from a logistic point of view, thanks to the support from ACL, but it was felt to lead to
somewhat less interesting events than in the past, sitting in the shadow of the larger conference and
competing with other satellite events. It was therefore decided to return to the standalone format in 2009,
with INRIA Rocquencourt and the University of Paris 7 volunteering to take charge of the organisation.
We would like to thank Eric de la Clergerie, Laurence Danlos, Benoit Sagot and the support staff at
INRIA and University of Paris 7 for their efforts to realize IWPT’09.
IWPT’09 is fortunate to have three very distinguished invited speakers: John Carroll from the university
of Sussex, Mark Johnson from Brown University, and Joakim Nivre from the University of Uppsala.
I would like to thank all the programme committee members for their careful and timely work, especially
those that took up extra rewiewing obligations at very short notice and those who participated in
discussions on diverging reviews. Special thanks go to Eric de la Clergerie, the programme chair,
for organising the reviewing, designing the workshop programme and producing the proceedings. The
scientific programme includes 14 accepted full papers and 27 accepted short papers (the latter being an
all-time high for IWPT), covering virtually all currently hot topics in parsing technology. Together with
the three invited talks by top experts in parsing, these papers provide a fascinating picture of the state of
the art in parsing natural language, that I hope you will enjoy and will find inspiring.

Much recent research in natural language parsing
takes as input carefully crafted, edited text, of-
ten from newspapers. However, many real-world
applications involve processing text which is not
written carefully by a native speaker, is produced
for an eventual audience of only one, and is in
essence ephemeral. In this talk I will present a
number of research and commercial applications
of this type which I and collaborators are develop-
ing, in which we parse text as diverse as mobile
phone text messages, non-native language learner
essays, internet chat, and primary care medical
notes. I will discuss the problems these types of
text pose for a parser, and outline how we integrate
information from parsing into applications.

Nonparametric Bayesian methods are interesting
because they may provide a way of learning the
appropriate units of generalization (i.e., the ”rules”
of a grammar) as well as the generalization’s
probability or weight (i.e., the rule’s probability).
Adaptor Grammars are a framework for stating
a variety of hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian
models, where the units of generalization can be
viewed as kinds of PCFG rules. This talk de-
scribes the mathematical and computational prop-
erties of Adaptor Grammars and linguistic appli-
cations such as word segmentation, syllabification
and named entity recognition. The later part of
the talk reviews MCMC inference and describes
the MCMC algorithms we use to sample adaptor
grammars.
Joint work with Sharon Goldwater and Tom Grif-
fiths.

There is a strong tendency in natural language syn-
tax such that elements that have a direct syntac-
tic relation are also adjacent in the surface real-
ization of a sentence. Nevertheless, notable ex-
ceptions to this generalization exist in practically
all languages and are especially common in lan-
guages with free or flexible word order. Syntactic
theorists, on the one hand, have developed a va-
riety of representational devices for dealing with
these exceptions, including phonetically null ele-
ments, gap threading, and non-projective depen-
dency trees. Syntactic parsers, on the other hand,
use these devices very restrictively since they add
to the complexity of an already daunting task. This
is especially true of data-driven parsers, where dis-
continuity is often simply ignored. In this talk, I
will review techniques for dealing with discontin-
uous structures in the framework of dependency
parsing, focusing on parsing algorithms that build
structures from non-adjacent elements and in par-
ticular transition-based algorithms that use online
reordering.

<abstract confidence="0.999645">Much recent research in natural language parsing takes as input carefully crafted, edited text, often from newspapers. However, many real-world applications involve processing text which is not written carefully by a native speaker, is produced for an eventual audience of only one, and is in essence ephemeral. In this talk I will present a number of research and commercial applications of this type which I and collaborators are developing, in which we parse text as diverse as mobile phone text messages, non-native language learner essays, internet chat, and primary care medical notes. I will discuss the problems these types of text pose for a parser, and outline how we integrate information from parsing into applications.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.951803888888889">Nonparametric Bayesian methods are interesting because they may provide a way of learning the appropriate units of generalization (i.e., the ”rules” of a grammar) as well as the generalization’s probability or weight (i.e., the rule’s probability). Adaptor Grammars are a framework for stating a variety of hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian models, where the units of generalization can be as kinds of PCFG rules. This talk describes the mathematical and computational properties of Adaptor Grammars and linguistic applications such as word segmentation, syllabification and named entity recognition. The later part of the talk reviews MCMC inference and describes the MCMC algorithms we use to sample adaptor grammars. Joint work with Sharon Goldwater and Tom Griffiths.</abstract>

<email confidence="0.661814">joakim.nivre@lingfil.uu.se</email>
<abstract confidence="0.999884545454545">There is a strong tendency in natural language syntax such that elements that have a direct syntactic relation are also adjacent in the surface realization of a sentence. Nevertheless, notable exceptions to this generalization exist in practically all languages and are especially common in languages with free or flexible word order. Syntactic theorists, on the one hand, have developed a variety of representational devices for dealing with these exceptions, including phonetically null elegap threading, and non-projective dependency trees. Syntactic parsers, on the other hand, use these devices very restrictively since they add to the complexity of an already daunting task. This is especially true of data-driven parsers, where discontinuity is often simply ignored. In this talk, I will review techniques for dealing with discontinuous structures in the framework of dependency parsing, focusing on parsing algorithms that build structures from non-adjacent elements and in particular transition-based algorithms that use online reordering.</abstract>
