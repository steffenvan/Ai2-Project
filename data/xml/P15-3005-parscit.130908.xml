Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999936722222222">
Social media has attracted attention be-
cause of its potential for extraction of in-
formation of various types. For exam-
ple, information collected from Twitter en-
ables us to build useful applications such
as predicting an epidemic of influenza.
However, using text information from so-
cial media poses challenges for event de-
tection because of the unreliable nature of
user-generated texts, which often include
counter-factual statements.
Consequently, this study proposes the use
of modality features to improve disease
event detection from Twitter messages, or
“tweets”. Experimental results demon-
strate that the combination of a modal-
ity dictionary and a modality analyzer im-
proves the F1-score by 3.5 points.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999781047619048">
The rapidly increasing popularity of Social Net-
working Services (SNSs) such as Twitter and
Facebook has greatly eased the dissemination of
information. Such data can serve as a valuable in-
formation resource for various applications. For
instance, Huberman et al. (2009) investigated ac-
tual linked structures of human networks, Boyd et
al. (2010) mapped out retweeting as a conversa-
tional practice, and Sakaki et al. (2010) detected
earthquakes using SNSs.
An important and widespread application of
SNS mining is in the public health field such as
infection detection. Among various infectious dis-
eases, influenza is one of the most important dis-
eases worldwide.
However, it is difficult to estimate the precise
number of influenza-infected patients based on
naïve textual features because SNS messages that
contain the word “flu” might not necessarily refer
to being infected with influenza. The following
tweets are examples of such cases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996020333333333">
(1) I might have the flu.
(2) If I had the flu, I would be forced to
rest.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.967085619047619">
“might” in example (1) suggests that there is only
a suspicion of having influenza. Similarly, “if” in
example (2) shows that the person is not actually
infected.
To filter these instances, we propose to integrate
two modalities of information into factuality anal-
ysis: shallow modality analysis based on a surface
string match and deep modality analysis based on
predicate-argument structure analysis. The main
contribution of this paper is two-fold:
• We annotate a new dataset extracted from
Twitter for flu detection and prediction task,
and extend the naïve bag-of-words model of
Aramaki et al. (2011) and propose several
Twitter-specific features for disease event de-
tection tasks.
• We show that modality information con-
tributes to the factuality analysis in influenza-
related tweets, which demonstrates the basic
feasibility of the proposed approach. All fea-
tures presented in this paper increase recall.

The task of influenza detection and prediction
originates from the work of Serfling (1963) in epi-
demiology who tried to define a threshold for in-
fluenza breakout.
Since then, various approaches have been
proposed for influenza detection and prediction
(Groendyke et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2002;
Mugglin et al., 2002).
During the last decade, web-mining approaches
have been proposed to detect influenza bursts in

their early stages. Two sources of people’s behav-
ior have been mainly employed: (1) web search
queries (such as Yahoo! search (Polgreen et al.,
2008) and Google search (Ginsberg et al., 2009)),
and (2) activity logs of SNSs. This study specifi-
cally examines the latter because of the availability
and accessibility of data.
Twitter is the SNS that is most frequently used
for influenza detection (Achrekar et al., 2012; Ara-
maki et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2012; Sadilek et al.,
2012; Lamb, 2013). Previous research on the sub-
ject has revealed a high correlation ratio between
the number of influenza patients and actual tweets
related to influenza.
It is possible to obtain large amounts of data
from Twitter texts, but the main challenge is to fil-
ter noise from this data. For example, Aramaki
et al. (2011) reported that half of the tweets con-
taining the word “cold (disease)” simply mention
some information about a disease, but do not refer
to the actual eventuality of having the disease.
To address that problem, a classifier was pro-
duced to ascertain the factuality of the disease
event. This paper follows that approach, us-
ing modality analysis, which provides a strong
clue for factuality analysis (Saurí and Pustejovsky,
2012).
Modality has been used and discussed in vari-
ous places. Li et al. (2014) employ such modal-
ity features, although they do not describe the ef-
fect of using modality features in web application
tasks. Furthermore, several workshops have been
organized around the use of specific modalities,
such as Negation and Speculation (e.g. NeSP-
NLP1). In this study, we use generic modality fea-
tures to improve factuality analysis.

3.1 Task and data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990074074074">
The disease event detection task is a binary clas-
sification task to extract/differentiate whether the
writer or the person around the writer is infected
with influenza or not. However, because of the in-
herently noisy nature of tweets, some tweet mes-
sages are unrelated to influenza infection even
when the messages include the word “flu.” There-
fore, we adopt a supervised approach first pro-
posed by Aramaki et al. (2011).
We annotate a tweet with a binary label (in-
fluenza positive and negative), as in prior stud-
ies (Aramaki et al., 2011) 2. If a tweet writer
(or anybody near the writer) is infected with in-
fluenza, then the label is positive. Otherwise, the
label is negative. Additionally, we save the time
stamp when the tweet was posted online. Table
1 presents some examples. For this study, we
use 10,443 Japanese tweet messages including the
word “flu.” In this dataset, the number of positive
examples is 1,319; the number of negative exam-
ples is 9,124.
Because language heavily relies on modality to
judge the factuality of sentences, modality anal-
ysis is a necessary process for factuality analy-
sis (Matsuyoshi et al., 2010b). In line with this
observation, we propose two ways to incorporate
modality analysis for factuality analysis.

The result of disease event detection is shown in
Table 4. Overall, they seem to have low recall and
F1-Score. However, it turns out to be difficult to
achieve high recall because the percentage of pos-
itive cases is extremely low (about 12.6%).
As shown, N-gram and Season features improve
F1-score. Although the shallow modality feature
boosts both precision and recall, the deep modal-
ity feature only improves recall in compensation
with precision. The highest recall for the F1-score
is achieved when using both shallow and deep
modality features from Tsutsuji and Zunda (in the
case of “All”). This result underscores the utility
of the modality features for classifying a post by
its factuality.
In addition, to judge the performance with re-
spect to the amount of data, we plot a learning
curve in Figure 1. Although the decision changes
only slightly, recall tends to improve by increasing
the amount of data.

As described in this paper, we demonstrate the

<bodyText confidence="0.99999025">
Table 5 shows the correct and incorrect examples
for the shallow modality. Example 1 is a cor-
rect example. In this case, we convert “1;LC”
(“seem”) into sense ID; the classifier outputs an
appropriate label. Example 2 is an example of
false positive. Example 3 is an example of a false
negative. Both examples are incorrect because
they are assigned wrong sense IDs. That point il-
lustrates the limitations of a simple string match,
which does not take the context into account. It is
necessary to perform word sense disambiguation
for modality-related words.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.93263">
5.2 Contribution and error analysis for deep
modality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942">
Next, we examine the deep modality features. Ta-
ble 6 presents results of the deep modality features
sorted by weight in descending order.
In many cases, the features can be understood
intuitively compared to those of shallow modal-
ity features. Among the posts including the word
“flu,” posts about disease warnings, posts about

vaccinations, and posts about epidemic news ac-
count for a large proportion. This tendency is ex-
hibited clearly when one assigns negative weights.
Positive weights include many event-nouns and
verbs that are related directly to the disease.
Table 7 presents correct and incorrect examples
for deep modality. Example 4 is a correct exam-
ple. The deep modality feature “infection = hap-
pened” makes it possible to judge Example 4 cor-
rectly. Deep modality features appear to be criti-
cal in many cases, but in some cases they do not
function as expected. Example 5 is an example
of a false positive. Because of the “infection =
happened” feature, the classifier judges it positive.
However, not the writer, but a well-known figure
(Watanabe of ASPARAGUS) has been infected
with influenza. This is a common mistake that the
classifier makes. This result indicates the impor-
tance of identifying the entity that is involved in
a disease event. Furthermore, our classifier is not
robust for non-event problems. Example 6 is an
example of false positive. This example does not
have the argument of an event. It is the character-
istics of the colloquial sentence. Such examples
can often be found in web documents.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991166666667">
This study examined a disease event detection
method incorporating both shallow and deep
modality features. Results show that the modality
features improve the accuracy of the influenza de-
tection. Although we have demonstrated that our
method is useful for particular disease event detec-
tions, we must still ascertain whether it is applica-
ble for other infectious diseases such as norovirus
and dengue.
As future work, we would like to disambiguate
functional expressions using sequence labeling
techniques (Utsuro et al., 2007); we would also
like to identify the predicate–argument structure
of disease events (Kanouchi et al., 2015). Apart
from that, an information extraction approach that
looks for more specific patterns should be verified.
Finally, we would like to adopt these findings to
improve the prediction of epidemics.

<abstract confidence="0.998047315789474">Social media has attracted attention because of its potential for extraction of information of various types. For example, information collected from Twitter enables us to build useful applications such as predicting an epidemic of influenza. However, using text information from social media poses challenges for event detection because of the unreliable nature of user-generated texts, which often include counter-factual statements. Consequently, this study proposes the use of modality features to improve disease event detection from Twitter messages, or “tweets”. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of a modality dictionary and a modality analyzer improves the F1-score by 3.5 points.</abstract>

Similarly, “if” in example (2) shows that the person is not actually infected. To filter these instances, we propose to integrate two modalities of information into factuality analysis: shallow modality analysis based on a surface string match and deep modality analysis based on predicate-argument structure analysis. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold: • We annotate a new dataset extracted from Twitter for flu detection and prediction task, and extend the naïve bag-of-words model of Aramaki et al. (2011) and propose several Twitter-specific features for disease event detection tasks. • We show that modality information contributes to the factuality analysis in influenzarelated tweets, which demonstrates the basic feasibility of the proposed approach. All features presented in this paper increase recall. 2 Related work The task of influenza detection and prediction originates from the work of Serfling (1963) in epidemiology who tried to define a threshold for influenza breakout. Since then, various approaches have been proposed for influenza detection and prediction (Groendyke et al., 2011; Mo</context>

In this study, we use generic modality features to improve factuality analysis. 1www.clips.ua.ac.be/NeSpNLP2010/ 3 Modality analysis for disease event detection 3.1 Task and data The disease event detection task is a binary classification task to extract/differentiate whether the writer or the person around the writer is infected with influenza or not. However, because of the inherently noisy nature of tweets, some tweet messages are unrelated to influenza infection even when the messages include the word “flu.” Therefore, we adopt a supervised approach first proposed by Aramaki et al. (2011). We annotate a tweet with a binary label (influenza positive and negative), as in prior studies (Aramaki et al., 2011) 2. If a tweet writer (or anybody near the writer) is infected with influenza, then the label is positive. Otherwise, the label is negative. Additionally, we save the time stamp when the tweet was posted online. Table 1 presents some examples. For this study, we use 10,443 Japanese tweet messages including the word “flu.” In this dataset, the number of positive examples is 1,319; the number of negative examples is 9,124.

Overall, they seem to have low recall and F1-Score. However, it turns out to be difficult to achieve high recall because the percentage of positive cases is extremely low (about 12.6%).

Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of a modality dictionary and a modality analyzer improves the F1-score by 3.5 points. 1 Introduction The rapidly increasing popularity of Social Networking Services (SNSs) such as Twitter and Facebook has greatly eased the dissemination of information. Such data can serve as a valuable information resource for various applications. For instance, Huberman et al. (2009) investigated actual linked structures of human networks, Boyd et al. (2010) mapped out retweeting as a conversational practice, and Sakaki et al. (2010) detected earthquakes using SNSs. An important and widespread application of SNS mining is in the public health field such as infection detection. Among various infectious diseases, influenza is one of the most important diseases worldwide. However, it is difficult to estimate the precise number of influenza-infected patients based on naïve textual features because SNS messages that contain the word “flu” might not necessarily refer to being infected with influenza. The following tweets are examples of such cases: (1) I might have the flu. (2) If I had the flu, I would be forced to rest. “migh</context>

To address that problem, a classifier was produced to ascertain the factuality of the disease event. This paper follows that approach, using modality analysis, which provides a strong clue for factuality analysis (Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2012). Modality has been used and discussed in various places. Li et al. (2014) employ such modality features, although they do not describe the effect of using modality features in web application tasks. Furthermore, several workshops have been organized around the use of specific modalities, such as Negation and Speculation (e.g. NeSPNLP1). In this study, we use generic modality features to improve factuality analysis. 1www.clips.ua.ac.be/NeSpNLP2010/ 3 Modality analysis for disease event detection 3.1 Task and data The disease event detection task is a binary classification task to extract/diffe</context>
