In this paper, we approach the problem of organisation
and control in automatic speech understanding systems
firstly, by presentine, a theory of the non-serial
interactions necessary between two processors in the
system; namely, the morphosyntactic and the prosodic,
and secondly, by showing how, when generalised, this
theory allows one to specify a highly efficient
architecture for a speech understanding system with a
simple control structure and genuinely independent
components. The theory of non-serial interactions we
present predicts that speech is temporally organised in
a very specific way; that is, the system would not
function effectively if the temporal distribution of
various types of information in speech were different.
The architecture we propose is developed from a study
of the task of speech understanding and, furthermore, is
specific to this task. Consequently, the paper argues
that general problem solving methods are unnecessary
for speech understanding.

I INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.998623285714286">
It is generally accepted that the control structures of
speech understanding systems (SUSs) must allow for
non-serial interactions between different knowledge
sources or components within the system. By non-
serial interaction (NSI) we refer to communication
which extends beyond the normal, serial, flow of
information entailed by the tasks undertaken by each
component. For example, the output of the word
recognition system will provide the input to
morphosyntactie analysis, almost by definition;
however, the operation of the morphosyntactie
analyser should be constrained on sonic occasions by
prosodic cues: soy, that her is accented and followed
by a &amp;quot;pause&amp;quot;. whilst clog is not, in

<bodyText confidence="0.998443830188679">
Similarly, the output of the morphosyntactic analyser
will provide the input to semantic analysis, but on
occasion, the operation of the rnorphosyntacile
analyser will be more efficient if it has access to
information about the discourse: say, that the horse
has no unique referent in
(2) The horse raced past the horn fell,
because this information will facilitate the reduced
relative interpretation (see Crain &amp; Steedman, in
press). Thus, NSIs will he required between
components which occur both before and after the
morphosynlactic analyser in the serial chain of
processors which constitute the complete SUS.
NSis can be captured in a strictly serial,
hierarchical model, in which the flow of information is
always &amp;quot;upwards&amp;quot;, by computing every possibility
compatible wilh the input at each level of processing.
However, this will involve much unnecessary
computation within each separate component which
could be avoided by utilising information already
teraaorally available in the signal or context of
utterance, but not part of the input to that level. An
alternative architecture is the heterarchical system;
this avoids such inefficiency, in principle, by allowing
each component to communicate with all other
components in the system. However, controlling the
flow of information and specifying the interfaces
between components in such systems has proved very
difficult (Reddy &amp; Erman, 1975). The most
sophisticated SUS architecture to date is the
blackboard model (Erman at al., 1980). The model
provides a means for common representation and a
global database for cornntunication between
components and allows control of the system to be
centralised and relatively independent of individual
components. The four essential elements of the model
- blackboard entries, knowledge sources, the
blackboard and an intelligent control mechanism -
interact to emulate a problem solving style that is
characteristically incremental and opportunistic. NSIs
are thus allowed to occur, in principle, when they will
be of greatest value for preventing unnecessary
computation.
What is striking about these system architectures
is that they place no limits on the kinds of interaction
which occur between components, that is, none of
them are based on any thecry of what kind of
interactions and communication will be needed in a
SUS. The designers of the Hearsay-II system were
explicit about this, arguing that what was required
was an architecture capable of supporting any form of
interaction, but which was still relatively efficient
(Erman &amp; Lesser, 1975:484).
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999619980392157">
There appear to be at least two problems with such an
approach Firstly. the designer of an individual
component must still Lake into account which other
components should be activated by its outputs, as well
as who provides its inputs, precisely because no
principles of interaction are provided by the model. This
entails, ever. within the loosely structured aggregation
hierarchy of the blackboard, some commitment to
decisions about inter-component traffic in information -
rational answers to these decisions cannot be provided
without a theory of interaction between individual
components in a SUS.
Secondly, a considerable amount of effort has gone
into specifying global scheduling heuristics for
maintaining an agenda of knowledge source activation
records in blackboard systems, and this has sometimes
led to treating the control problem as a distinct issue
indep:mdent of the domain under consideration,
localising it on a separate, scheduling, blackboard
(Balzer, Erman and London. 1980: Hayes-Roth, 1983a).
Once again, this is because the blackboard framework,
as it is defined, provides no inherent constraints on
interactions (Hayes-Roth, 1983b). While this means that
the model is powerful enough to replicate control
strategies used in qualitatively different. Al systems, as
well as generalise to problem-solving in multiple domains
(Hayes-Roth, 1983a). the blackboard method of control
still fails to provide a complete answer to the scheduling
problem. It is intended predominantly for solving
problems whose solution depends on heuristics which
must cope with large volumes of noisy data.
In the context of a blackboard-based SUS, where
Lhe assumption that the formation of the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot;
interpretation of an input signal will, inevitably, be
accompanied by the generation of many competing
(partial) interpretations is implicit in the redundancy
encodcid in the individual knowledge sources, the only
real and practical answer to the control problem
remains the development of global strategies to keep
unnecessary computation within practical limits. These
strategies are developed by tuning the system on the
basis of performance criteria; this Luning appears to
limit interactions to just. those optimal cases which are
likely to yield successful analyses. However, insofar as
Lhe final system might claim to embody a theory about
which interactions are useful, this will never be
represented in an explicit form in the loosely structured
system components, but only implicitly in the the run-
time behaviour of the whole system: and therefore is
unlikely to be recoverable (see the analogous criticism in
I layes-Roth, 1983a:55).

I INTERACTIVE DETERMINISM:
A THEORY OF NON-SERIAL INTERACTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970138211538461">
In this section, we concentrate on the study of NSI
between morphosyntactic and prosodic information in
speech, largely from the perspective of
morphosyntactic analysis. This interaction occurs
between two of the better understood components of a
SUS and therefore seems an appropriate starting point
for the development of a theory of NSIs.
Lea (1980) argues that prosodic information will
be of use for morphosyntactic processing. This
discussion is based on the observation (see Cooper &amp;
Paccia-Cooper. 1980; Cooper &amp; Sorenson, 1981), that
there is a strong correlation between some syntactic
boundaries and prosodic effects such as lengthening,
step up in fundamental frequency, changes of
amplitude ani., sometimes, pausing. However, many of
these effects are probably irrelevant to
morphosyntactic analysis, being, for example, side
effects of production, such as planning, hesitation,
afterthoughts, false starts, and so forth. If prosody is
to be utilised effectively to facilitate morphosyntactic
analysis, then we require a theory capable of
indicating when an ambiguous prosodic cue such as
lengthening is a consequence of syntactic environment
and, therefore, relevant to morphosyntactic analysis.
None of Lea&apos;s proposals make this distinction.
In order to develop such a theory, we require a
precise account of morphosyntactic analysis embedded
in a model of a SUS which specifies the nature of the
NSIs available to the morphosyntactic analyser
Consider a simple modular architecture of a SUS in
which most information flows upwards through each
level of processing, as in the serial, hierarchical
model. This information is passed without delay, so
any operation performed by a processor will be passed
up to its successor in the chain of processors
immediately (see Fig. i).
Furthermore, we constrain the model as follows:
at least from the point of word recognition upwards,
only one interpretation is computed at each level.
That is, word recognition returns a series of unique,
correct words, then morphosyntactic analysis provides
the unique, correct grammatical description of these
words, and so forth. In order to implement such a
constraint on the processing, the model includes, in
addition to the primary flow of information, secondary
channels of communication which provide for the NSIs
(represented by single arrows in the diagram). These
interactive channels are bidirectional, allowing one
component to request certain highly restricted kinds
of information from another component and, in
principle, can connect any pair of processors in a
SUS

Imagine a morphosyntactic analyser which builds
a unique structure without backtracking and employs
no, or very little, look-ahead Such a parser will face a
choice point, irresolvable morphosyntactically, almost
every time it encounters a structural ambiguity,
whether local or global. Further, suppose that this
parser seeks to apply some general strategies to
resolve such choices, that is. to select a particular
grammatical interpretation when faced with ambiguity.
If such a parser is to be able to operate
deterministically. and still return the correct analysis
without error, in cases when a general strategy would
yield the wrong analysis, then it will require
interactive channels for transmitting a signal capable
of blocking the application of the strategy and forcing
the correct analysis. These are the secondary
channels of communication posited in the model of the
SUS above.
A theory of NSIs should specify when, in terms
of the operation of any individual processor,
interaction will be necessary; interactive channels for
this parser must be capable of providing this
information at the onset of any given
morphosyntactic ambiguity, which is defined as the
point at which the parser will have to apply its
resolution strategy. In order to make the concept of
onset of ambiguity precise a model of the

rnorphosyntactic component of a SUS was designed
and implemented. This analyser (henceforth the
LEXical-CATegorial parser - because it employs an
Extended Categorial Gl-ammar (eg. Ades Sc Steedman,
1982) representing morphosyntactic information as an
extension of the lexicon) makes specific predictions
about the temporal availability of non-morphosyntactic
information crucial to the theory of NSIs presented
here. LEXICAT&apos;s strategy for resolution of ambiguities
is approximately a combination of late closure
(Frazier, 1979) and right association (Kimball, 1073).
LEXICAT is a species of shift-reduce parser which
employs the same stack for the storage and analysis
of input and inspects the top three cells of the stuck
before each parsing operation. Reduction, however,
never involves more than two cells, so the top cell of
the stack acts as a very restricted one word look-
ahead buffer. In general, LEXICAT reduces the items in
cells two and three provided that reduction between
cells one and two is not grammatically possible.
When LEXICAT encounters ambiguity, in the
majority of situations this surfaces as a choice
between shifting and reducing. When a shift-reduce
choice arises between either cells one and two or two
and three, reduction will be preferred by default;
although, of course, a set of interactive requests will
be generated at the point when this choice arises, and
these may provide information which blocks the
preferred strategy. The approximate effect of the
preference for reduction is that incoming material is
attached to the constituent currently under analysis
which is &amp;quot;lowest&amp;quot; in the phrase structure tree. LEXICAT
is similar to recent proposals by Church (1980),
Pereira (in press) and Shieber (1983), in that it.
employs general strategies, stated in terms of the
parser&apos;s basic operations, in order to parse
detcrminh cally with an ambiguous grammar.
A theory of NSIs should also specify how
interaction occurs. When LEXICAT recognises a choice
point, it makes a request for non-morphosyntactic
information relevant to this choice on all of the
interactive channels to which it is connected; if any of
these channels returns a positive response, the
default interpretation is overridden. The parser is
therefore agnostic concerning which channel might
provide the relevant information: for example,
analysing
(3) Before the King rides his horse
it usually groomed.
The onset of this morphosyntactic ambiguity arises
when the horse has been analysed as a noun phrase.
LEXICAT must decide at this point whether rides is to
be treated as transitive or intransitive: the transitive
This is not completely accurate; see Briscoe
1984:Ch3 for a full description of LEXICAT.

reading is preferred given the res7.1iution strategy
outlined al:ove. Therefore, an interactive request will
be generated requesting information concerning the
relationship between these two constituents. A simple
yes/no response is all that is needed along this
interactive channel: &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to prevent application of the
strategy, &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; if the processor concerned finds
nothing relevant to the decision. In relation to this
example, consider the channel to the prosodic
analyser which monitors for prosodic &amp;quot;breaks&amp;quot; (defined
in terms of vowel lengthening, change of fundamental
frequency and so forth): when the request is received
the prosodic analyser returns a positive response if
such a break is present in the appropriate part of the
speech signal. In (3) none of these cues is likely to
occur since the relevant boundary is syntactically
weak (see- Cooper Sc Paccia-Cooper, 1980), so the
interactive request will not result in a positive
response, the default resolution strategy will apply
and his horse will be interpreted as direct object of
rides. In
(4) ilefore the King rides his horse
is usually groomed,
en the other hand, an interactive request will be
generated at the same point, but the interactive
channel between the prosodic and morphosyntactic
components is likely to produce a positive response
since the boundary between rides and his horse is
syntactically stronger. Thus, at tachment will be
blocked, closing the subordinate clause, and thereby
forcing the correct interpretation.
NSI *then, is restricted to a set. of yes/no
responses over the interactive channels at the
explicit request of the processor connected to those
channels, where a positive respense on one interactive
channel suffices to override the unmarked choice
which would be made in the absence of such a signal.
This highly restricted form of interaction is sufficient
to guarantee that I,EXICAT will prouuce the correct
analysis even in cases of severe multiple ambiguity;
for example, ..malysing the noun compound in
(3)/3oron epoxy rocket motor chambers,
(from Marcus, 1980:253), there are fourteen+ licit
morphosyntactic interpretations, assuming standard
grammatical analyses (eg. Selkirk, 1993). However, if
this example were spoken and we assume that it would
have the prosodic structure predicted by Cooper &amp;
Paccia-Cooper&apos;s (1980) algorithm for deriving prosody
from syntactic structure, LEXICAT could produce the
correct analysis without error, just through
interaction with the prosodic analyser. As each noun
enters the analyser, reduction will be blocked by the
general strategy but, because 1,EXICAT will recognise
the existence of ambiguity, an interactive request will
be generotecl before each shift. The prosodic break
channel will then prevent reduction after epoxy and
after motor, forcing the correct analysis ((boron
epoxy) ((rocket motor) chambers)), as opposed to the
default right-branching structure.
Thus, NSI between the morphosyntactic and
prosodic components can be captured by a bistable,
bidirectional link capable of transmitting a request
and signaling a binary reponse, either blocking or
allowing the application of the relevant strategy
according to the presence or absence of a prosodic
break. Given the simplicity of this interaction, the
prosodic analyser requires no more information from
the parser than that a decision is requested
concerning a particular boundary. Nor need the
prosodic analyser decide, prior to an interactive
request on this channel, whether a particular
occurrence of, say lengthening, is signalling the
presence of a prosodic break, rather than for instance
stress, since the request itself will help resolve the
interpretation of the cue. Moreover, we have a simple
generalisation about when interactive requests will be
made since this account of NSIs predicts that prosodic
information will only be relevant to morphosyntactic
analysis at the onset of a morphosyntactic ambiguity.
If we assume (boldly) that this account of NSI
between the morphosyntactic and prosodic analysers
will generalise to a complete model of SUS, then such
a model makes a set of predictions concerning the
temporal availability of interactive information in the
speech signal and representation of the context of
utterance. In effect, it claims that the SUS
arcnilecture simply presupposes that language is
organised in the appropriate fashion since the model
will not. function if it is not. We call this strong
prediction about the temporal organisation of the
speech signal the Interactive Determinism (ID)
Hypothesis since it is essentially an extension of
Marcus&apos; (1930) Determinism Hypothesis.

The ID hypothesis predicts that speech and the
representation of context is organised in such a way
that, information will be available, when needed, via
NSI to resolve a choice in any individual component at
the point when that choice arises. Thus in the case of
prosodic interaction with morphosyntactic analysis the
theory predicts that a prosodic break should be
present in speech at the onset of a morphosyntactic

confidence ratings rather than a discrete choice.
In this case levels of certainty concerning the
presence/absence of relevant events could be

ambiguity which requires a non-default interpretation
and which is not resolved by other non-
morphosyntactic information. This aspect of the ID
hypothesis has been tested and corroborated by Paul
Warren (1983; in prep; also see Briscoe, 1984:Ch4),
who has undertaken a series of speech production
experiments in which (typically) ten subjects read
aloud a list of sentences. This list contains sets of
pairs of locally ambiguous sentences, and some filler
sentences so that the purpose of the experiment is
not apparent to the subjects. Their productions are
analysed acoustically and the results of this analysis
are then checked statistically. The technique gives a
good indication of whether the cues associated with a
prosodic break are present at the appropriate points
in the speech signal, and their consistency across
different speakers.
Returning to examples (3) and (4) above, we
noted that a prosodic break would be required in (4),
but not (3), to prevent attachment of rides and his
horse. Warren found exactly this pattern of results;
the duration of rides (and similar items in this
position) is an average 51% longer in (4) and the fall
in fundamental frequency is almost twice as great with
a corresponding step up to horse, as compared to a
smooth declination across this boundary in (3)

LEXICAT prefers attachment of The company to
awarded, treating awarded as the main verb. In the
case where awarded must be treated as the beginning
of a reduced relative, Warren found that the duration
of the final syllable of company is lengthened and that
the same pattern of fall and step up in fundamental
frequency occurs. Perhaps the most, interesting cases
are ambiguous constituent questions; Church
(1980.117) argued that it is probably impossible to
parse these deterministically by employing look-ahead:
&amp;quot;The really hard problem with wh-movement is
finding the &amp;quot;gap&amp;quot; where the wh-element
originated. This is not particularly difficult for
a non-deterministic competence theory, but it
is (probably) impossible for a deterministic
processing model.&amp;quot;
LEXICAT predicts that in a sentence such as

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992775666666667">
the potential point of attachment of Who as direct
object of want will be ignored by default in preference
for the immediate attachment of to give. Thus there is
a prediction that the sentence, when spoken, should
contain a prosodic break at this point. Warren has
found some evidence for this prediction, i.e. want is
lengthened as compared to examples where this is not
the correct point of attachment of the proposed
phrase, such as

but the prosodic cues, although consistent, are
comparatively weak, and it is not clear that listeners
are utilising them in the manner predicted by the
theory (see Briscoe, 1984:Ch4).
A different kind of support is provided by
sentences such as

<listItem confidence="0.5492565">
(9) Before the King rides a servant

<bodyText confidence="0.999759714285714">
which exhibit the same local ambiguity as (3) and (4)
but where the semantic interpretation of the noun
phrase makes the direct object reading implausible. In
this case it is likely that an interactive channel
between the semantic and morphosyntactic analysers
would block the incorrect interpretation. So there is a
prediction that the functional load on prosodic
information will decrease and, therefore, that the
prosodic cues to the break may be less marked. This
prediction was again corroborated by Warren who
found that the prosodic break in examples such as (9)
was significantly less marked acoustically than for
e-:amples such as (4) . In general then, these
experimental results support the ID hypothesis.

<bodyText confidence="0.999928458333333">
In a SUS based on the ID model, the main flow of
information will be defined by the tasks of each
component, and their medium of communication, will
be a natural consequence of these tasks; as for the
serial, hierarchical model. However, in the ID model,
unlike the hierarchical model, there are less
overheads because unnecessary computation at any
levci of processing will be eliminated by the INSIs
between components. These interactions will, of
course, require a large number of interactive
channels; but these do not imply a common
representation language because the information
which passes along them is representation-independent
and restricted to a minimal request and a binary
response. Each channel in the full SOS will be
dedicated to a specific interaction between
components; so the morphosyntactic component will
require a prosodic break channel and a unique
referent channel (see example (1)), and so forth.
Thus, a complete model of SUS will implement a theory
of the types of NSI required between all components.
Finally, the ID model will not require that any
individual processor has knowledge of the nature of
the operations of another processor; that is. the

morphosyhtactic analyser need not know what is being
computed at the other end of the prosodic break
channel, or how: nor need the prosodic analyser know
why it is computing the presence or absence of a
prosodic break. Rather, the knowledge that this
informal ion is potentially important is expressed by
the existence of this particular interactive channel.
The control structure of this model is
straightforward; after each separate operation of each
individual cGmponent the results of this operation will
be passed to the next component in the serial chain
of processors. An interactive request will be made by
any component only when laced with an indeterminism
irresolvable in terms of the input available to it. No
further scheduling or centralised control of processing
will be required. Furthermore, although each individual
component determines when NSis will occur, because
of the restricted nature of this interaction each
component can still be developed as a completely
independent knowledge source.
The deterministic nature of the individual
components of this SUS eliminates the need for any
global heurist ics to be brought into the analysis of the
speech signal. Thus we have di:ipensed neatly with the
requirement for an over-powerful and over-general
problem-solving framework, such as the blackboard,
and replaced it with a theory specific to the domain
under coru;:derAt ion; tmrnely, language. The theory of
!,Sis offers a satisfactory specific method for speech
und(. cstanding which allows the separate specialist
coinponent procedures of a SUS to be
&amp;quot;algori thmetized- and compiled. As Erman et al.
(1980:246) suggest: &amp;quot;In such a case the flexibility of a
system like Hearsay-II may no longer be needed&amp;quot;.
The restrictions on the nature and directionality
of NSI channels in a SUS, and the situations in which
they need to be activated, allows a modular system
whose control structure is not much more complex
than that of the hierarchical model, and yet, via the
network of interactive channels, achieves the
efficiency sought by the heterarehical and blackboard
models, without the concomitant preblems of common
knowledge representations and complex
communications protocols between separate knowledge
se/Ai-cies. Thus, the ID model dispenses with the
overhead costs of data-directed activation of
::aowledge sources and the need for opportunistic
scheduling or a complex focus-of-control mechanism.
IV CONCLUSION
In this paper we have proposed a very idealised model
of a SUS with a simple organisation and control
structure. Clearly, the ID model assumes a greater
level of understanding of many aspects of speech
processing than is current. For example, we have
assumed that the word recognition component is
capable of returning a series of unique, correct lexical
items; even with interaction of the kind envisaged, it
is doubtful that our current understanding of
acoustic-phonetic analysis is good enough for it to be
possible to build such a component now. Nevertheless,
, experimental work reported by Marslen-Wilson &amp;
Tyler (1980) and Cole &amp; Jakimik (1980), for example,
suggests that listeners are capable of accessing a
unique lexical item on the basis of the acoustic signal
and interactive feedback from the developing analysis
of the utterance and its context (often before the
acoustic signal is complete). More seriously, from the
perspective of interactive determinism, little has been
said about the many other interactive channels which
will be required for speech understanding and, in
particular, whether. these channels can be as
restricted as the prosodic break channel. For example,
consider the channel which will be required to capture
the interaction in example (9); this will need to be
sensitive to something like semantic &amp;quot;anomaly&amp;quot;.
However, semantic anomaly is an inherently vague
concept., particularly by comparison with that of a
prosodic break. Similarly, as we noted above, the
morphosyntaclic analyser will require an interactive
channel to the discourse analyser which indicates
whether a noun phrase followed by a potential relative
clause, such as the horse in (2), has a unique
referent. However, since this channel would only seem
to be relevant to ambiguities involving relative clauses,
it appears to cast doubt on the claim that interactive
requests are generated automatically on every channel
each time any type of ambiguity is encountered. This,
in turn, suggests that the control structure proposed
in the last section is oversimplified.
Nevertheless, by studying those tasks in terms of
far more restricted and potentially more
computationally efficient models, we are more likely to
uncover restrictions on language which, once
discovered, will take us a step closer to tractable
solutions to the task of speech understanding. Thus,
the work reported here suggests that language is
organised in such a manner that morphosyntactic
analysis can proceed deterministically on the basis of
a very restricted parsing algorithm, because non-
structural information necessary to resolve
ambiguities will be available in the speech signal (or
representation of the context of utterance) at the
point when the choice arises during morphosyntactic
analysis.
The account of morphosyntactic analysis that
this constraint allows is more elegant, parsimonious

and empirically adequate than employing look-ahead
(Marcus, 1980). Firstly, an account based on look-
ahead is forced to claim that local and global
ambiguities are resolved by different mechanisms
(since the latter, by definition, cannot be resolved by
the use of morphosyntactic information further
downstream in the signal), whilst the ID model
requires only one mechanism. Secondly, restricted
look-ahead fails to delimit accurately the class of so-
called garden path sentences (Milne, 1982; Briscoe,
1983), whilst the ID account correctly predicts their
&amp;quot;interactive&amp;quot; nature (Briscoe, 1982, 1984; Crain Sc
Steedrnan, in press). Thirdly, look-ahead involves
delaying decisions, a strategy which is made
implausible, at least in the context of speech
understanding, by the body of experimental results
summarised by Tyler (1981), which suggest that
morphosynin,.lic analysis is extremely rapid.
The generalisation of these results to a complete
model of SUS represents commitment to a research
programme which sets as its goal the discovery of
constraints on language which allow the associated
processing tasks to be implemented in an efficient and
tractable manner. What is advocated here, therefore,
is the development of a computational theory of
language processing derived through the study of
language from the perspective of these processing
tasks, much in the same way in which Marr (1982)
developed his computational theory of vision.

<abstract confidence="0.99870085">paper, we approach the problem of organisation and control in automatic speech understanding systems firstly, by presentine, a theory of the non-serial interactions necessary between two processors in the system; namely, the morphosyntactic and the prosodic, and secondly, by showing how, when generalised, this theory allows one to specify a highly efficient architecture for a speech understanding system with a simple control structure and genuinely independent components. The theory of non-serial interactions we present predicts that speech is temporally organised in a very specific way; that is, the system would not function effectively if the temporal distribution of various types of information in speech were different. The architecture we propose is developed from a study of the task of speech understanding and, furthermore, is specific to this task. Consequently, the paper argues that general problem solving methods are unnecessary for speech understanding.</abstract>
