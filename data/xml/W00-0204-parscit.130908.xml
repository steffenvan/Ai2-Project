In this paper, we describe the Universal Networking Language, an interlingua
to be plugged in a Web environment aiming at allowing for many-to-many
information exchange, &apos;many&apos; here referring to many natural languages. The
interlingua is embedded in a Knowledge-Base MT system whose language-
dependent modules comprise an encoder, a decoder, and linguistic resources
that have been developed by native speakers of each language involved in the
project. Issues concerning both the interlingua formalism and its foundational
issues are discussed.

<bodyText confidence="0.979770696969697">
The widespread use of the Web and the
growing Internet facilities have sparked
enormous interest in improving the ways
people use to communicate. In this context
multilingual Machine Translation systems
become prominent, for they allow for a huge
information flow. To date, MT systems have
been built under limited conditions, of which
we highlight two: i) in general, they mirror
one-to-many(languages) or many(languages)-
to-one approaches, often involving English at
the &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; end; ii) communication is reduced
to basic information exchange, ignoring
richness and flexibility implied by human
mind. The first limitation has been seldom
overcome, since it requires a robust
environment and research teams that can
cope with knowledge of several languages&apos;,
to derive precise automatic language
analyzers and synthesizers. The second
limitation follows up the first: adding up
communicative issues to linguistic
processing/modeling makes still harder to
overcome MT limitations.
In this article, we elaborate on work using
an interlingua conceived to overcome the first
limitation, i.e., to allow for a many-to-many
information exchange environment, which
shall be plugged in a nontraditional Internet
platform. The goal is to allow interlocutors to
entangle communication even if they do not
share the same mother tongue or the English
&apos;Standing, most often, for natural language, or NL.

language, unlike MT systems that have just
one language at one of their edges. As the
main component of a Knowledge-Base MT
system (hereafter, KBMT), the interlingua
approach has been developed under the
Universal Networking Language Project, or
simply UNL Project. What makes the
interlingua UNL special is its intended use:
as an electronic language for networks, it has
to allow for high quality2 conversation
systems involving many languages. As the
main component of a ICI3MT system, it has to
be sufficiently robust to ground research and
development (R&amp;D) of the language-specific
modules to be attached to the system. It is
this latter perspective that is undertaken here:
from the viewpoint of R&amp;D, we discuss how
broad, or language-independent, the
interlingua UNL is, especially focusing on its
syntax and coverage. In addition to being
consistent and complete to represent
meaning, we also consider its sharing by
researchers all around the world, which is an
important bottleneck of the UNL Project,
since information exchange by researchers
during R&amp;D brings about the problems
introduced by the interlingua UNL itself,
concerning both its formalism and
foundational issues. Before discussing this
topic in Section 5, we present an overview of
the UNL Project (Section 2) and describe the
main features of the interlingua UNL
(Section 3). In Section 4, we describe the
UNL system architecture. Hereafter,
&apos;interlingua UNL&apos; will be simply referred to
as UNL, the acronym for Universal
Networking Language. Also, the viewpoint
presented here is that of interlingua users
who experience R&amp;D for a given NL, and not
of its authors.

The UNL Project3 has been launched by
the United Nations University to foster and
ease international web communication by
means of NLP systems. Its main strength lies
on the development of the UNL, as a unique
semantic (or meaning) representation that can
be interchanged with the various languages to
be integrated in the ICBMT system. In the
UNL Project, plug-in software to encode NL
texts onto UNL ones (NL-UNL encoders)
and to decode UNL into NL texts (UNL-NL
decoders) have been developed by R&amp;D
groups in their own native languages. The
modules to process Brazilian Portuguese4, for
example, have been developed by a team of
Portuguese native speakers that comprises
linguists, computational linguists, and
computer experts. Such packages will be
made available in WWW servers and will be
accessible by browsing through Internet, thus
overcoming the need for people all around
the world to learn the language of their
interlocutors. Several linguistic groups have
signed to the. Project, namely: the Indo-
European (Portuguese, Spanish, French,
Italian, English, German, Russian, Latvian
and Hindi), the Semitic (Arabic), the Sino-
Tibetan (Chinese), the Ural-Altaic
(Mongolian), the Malayan-Polynesian
(Indonesian), and the Japanese.
On the one hand, the main strength of
the Project is that knowledgeable specialists
address language-dependent issues of their
mother tongue, most of which are related to
R&amp;D of the encoding and decoding modules
and to the specification of the NL-UNL
lexicon. On the other hand, this also
represents a crucial problem faced by the
project participants, for distinct groups may
interpret the interlingua specification
differently. There is thus the need for a
consensus about the UNL formalism,

The UNL is a formal language designed
for rendering automatic multilingual
information exchange. It is intended to be a
cross-linguistic semantic representation of
NL sentence meaning, being the core of the
UNL System, the KBMT system developed
by H. Uchida (1996) at the Institute of
Advanced - Studies, United Nations
University, Tokyo; Japan.
UNL subsumes a tridimensional theory of
(sentence) meaning, whose components are
defined according to one of the following sets
(Martins et al., 1998a): concepts (e.g., &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;sit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;mat&amp;quot;), concept relations (e.g.,
&amp;quot;agent&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;place&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;object&amp;quot;), and concept
predicates (e.g., &amp;quot;past&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;definite&amp;quot;). Such
components are formally and
correspondingly represented by three
different kinds of entities, namely: Universal
Words (UWs), Relation Labels (RLs), and
Attribute Labels (ALs). According to the
UNL syntax, information conveyed by each
sentence can be represented by a hypergraph
whose nodes represent UWs and whose arcs
represent RLs. To make symbol processing
simpler, hypergraphs are often reduced to
lists of ordered binary relations between
concepts, as it is shown in Figure 1 for the
sentence (1) The cat sat on the mat.5

UWs are labels for concept-like
information, roughly corresponding to the
lexical level in the sentence structure. They
comprise an open large inventory, virtually
capable of denoting every non-compositional
meaning to be conveyed by any speaker of
any language. For the sake of representation,
these atomic semantic contents are associated
to English words and expressions, which play
the role of semantic labels. However, there is
no one-to-one mapping between the English
vocabulary and the UNL lexicon, for UNL,
as a multilingual representation code, is
larger than the English vocabulary. To avoid
unnecessary proliferation of the UNL
vocabulary and to certify that standards be
observed by UNL teams, control over the
specification of the UW set is centered at the
UNL Center, in Japan.
Several semantic relationships hold
between UWs, namely synonymy, antonymy,
hyponymy, hypemymy and meronymy,
which compose the. UNL Ontology. Steady
semantic valencies (such as agent and object
features) can also be represented, forming the
UNL Knowledge-Base. Both Ontology and
Knowledge-Base aim at constraining the
scope of UW labels, whenever ambiguity is
to be avoided. The UNL representation of
sentence (1), for example, can be ambiguous

in Romance languages, for the translation of
&apos;cat&apos; should make explicit the animal sex: if
male, it would be &amp;quot;gato&amp;quot; (Portuguese and
Spanish), &amp;quot;gatto&amp;quot; (Italian), &amp;quot;chat&amp;quot; (French),
whereas different names would have to be
used for the female cat. Instead of having a
unique UW &apos;cat&apos;, it is thus quite feasible to
have a whole structure in which &apos;cat&apos; is only
the hyper-ordinate option.
For the English-UNL association not to
undermine the intended universality of the
UW inventory, its semantic-orthograpical
correspondence has to be considered rather
incidental, or even- approximated. It is not
always the case that extensions6 of a UW
label and of its corresponding English word
coincide. The extension of the English word
&amp;quot;mat&amp;quot;, for example, does not exactly coincide
with the extension of any Portuguese word,
although we can find many overlaps between
&amp;quot;mat&amp;quot; and, e.g., &amp;quot;capacho&amp;quot; (Portuguese).
Portuguese speakers, however, would not say
&amp;quot;capacho&amp;quot; for the ornamental dishmat, as
would not English speakers use the word
&amp;quot;mat&amp;quot; for a fawner (still &amp;quot;capacho&amp;quot; in
Portuguese). Since each language categorizes
the world in a very idiosyncratic way, it
would be misleading to impose a
straightforward correspondence between
lexical items of two different languages. In
UNL, this problem has been overcome by
proposing a rather analogic lexicon, instead
of a digital one. Although discrete, UWs
convey continuous entities, in the sense that
semantic gaps between concepts are fulfilled
by the UNL Knowledge-Base, as it is shown
for the UW &apos;mat&apos; in Figure 2. Granularity
thus plays an important role in UNL lexical
organization and brings flexibility into cross-
linguistic lexical matching.

While lexical representation in UNL
comprises a set of universal concepts
signaled by UWs, the cross-lexical level
involves a set of ordered binary relations
between UWs, which are the Relation Labels
(RLs). RLs specification are similar to
Fillmore&apos;s semantic cases (1968), with RLs
corresponding to semantic-value relations
linking concept-like information. There are
currently 44 RLs, but this set has been
continuously modified by empirical evidence
of lack, or redundancy, of relations. The
inventory of RLs can be divided into three
parts, according to the functional aspects of
the related concepts: ontological, event-like
and logical relations. Ontological relations
are used as UW constraints in reducing
lexical granularity or, avoiding ambiguity as
shown above, and they help positioning UWs
in a UNL lexical structure. Five different
labels are used to convey ontological
relations: id l (hyponymy), equ (synonymy),
ant (antonymy), pof (meronymy), and fid
(semantic field).

UNL depicts sentence meaning as a fact
composed by either a simple or a complex
event, which is considered here the starting
point of a UNL representation, i.e., its
minimal complete semantic unit. Event-like
relations are assigned by an event external or
internal structure, or by both. An event
external structure has to do nearly always
with time and space boundaries. It can be
referred to by a set of RLs signaling the event
co-occurrent meanings, such asl its
environment (sen); starting place (pit),
finishing place (pit), or, simply, place (plc);
range (fmt); starting time (tmt), finishing
time (tmt), or, simply, time (tim); and
duration (dur). Action modifiers, . such as
manner (man) and method (met) can also
qualify this structure. An event internal
structure is associated to one of the following
simple frames: action, activity, movement,
state, and process, each expressing different
RLs in the event itself, including its actors
and circumstances.
Event actors are any animate or inanimate
character playing any role in events, which
can be the main or the coadjutant actors.
There can be up to eight actors, signaled by
the following RLs: agent (agt), co-agent
(cag), object (obj), co-object (cob), object
place (opl), beneficiary (ben), partner (ptn)
and instrument (ins). They can also be
coordinated through the RLs conjunction
(and) and disjunction (or), or subordinated to
each other by possession (pos), content (cnt),
naming (nam), comparison (bas), proportion
(per), and modification (mod). They can still
be quantified (qua) or qualified by the RLs
&amp;quot;property attribution&amp;quot; (aoj) and co-attribution
(cao). It is possible to refer to an &amp;quot;initial
actor&amp;quot; (src), a &amp;quot;final actor&amp;quot; (go]), or an
&amp;quot;intermediary actor&amp;quot; (via). Finally, spatial
relationships can also hold between actors:
current place (plc), origin (frm), destination
(to), and path (via). Besides single events,
there can still be complex cross-event
RLs names are bracketed.
relationships which express either paralleled
events â€” co-occurrence (coo), conjunction
(and), and disjunction (or) â€” or hierarchically
posed events â€” purpose (pur), reason (rsn),
condition (con), and sequence (seq). They
can all be referred to as logical relations,
since they are often isomorphic to first-order
logic predicates.
According to the UNL authors, it is
possible to codify any sentence written in any
NL into a corresponding UNL text expressing
the sentence meaning through the use of the
above RLs. This is still a claim to be verified,
since cases of superposition and competition
between different RLs have been observed,
as it is discussed in Section 5.
In addition to UWs and RLs, UNL
makes use of predicate-like information, or
Attribute Labels (ALs), which are names for
event and concept &amp;quot;transformations&amp;quot;, in a
sense very close to that intended by Chomsky
(1957, 1965). They are not explicitly
represented in a UNL hypergraph, although
they are used to modify its nodes. ALs can
convey information about concept intensions
and extensions. In the former case, ALs name
information about utterers&apos; intensions over
either specific parts of a sentence (focus,
topic, emphasis, theme) or the whole
structure (exclamation, interrogation,
invitation, recommendation, obligation, etc.).
In the latter case, ALs refer to spatial
(definite, indefinite, generic, plural) or
temporal (past, present, future) information,
or still, temporal external (begin-soon, begin-
just, end-soon, end-just) or internal
(perfective, progressive, imperfective,
iterative) structures. To differentiate ALs
from UWs, ALs are attached to UWs by the
symbol &amp;quot;.@&amp;quot;. The concept expressed by the
UW &apos;sit&apos; in &amp;quot;sit.@entry. @past&amp;quot;, for example,
is taken as the starting point (.@entry) of the
corresponding hypergraph and it is to be
modified by temporal information (. @past).

A source document (SLD) conveys
written text on any subject, in any of the NLs
considered. There is no constraint in the
domain or structure of the SLD, but there is
necessarily a loss of semantic expressiveness
during NL-UNL encoding. The goal of the
UNL is not, in principle, to fully preserve text
meaning, but only its main components, i.e.,
those considered to be essential. However,
there is no measurable account as to what is
essential in the UNL Project. By convention,
this is linked to what has been called the
literal meaning, which is directly derived
from interpreting the sentence surface
structure. Therefore, there is no room to
represent content that is not directly mapped
onto the NL syntactic-semantic licensed
structures.
The NL-UNL encoding tool, or UNL
Encoder, is generic enough to handle all the

languages included in the Project. Apart from
the (supposedly) universal knowledge-base,
used to fill-in possible interlexical gaps when
mapping is not precise, all other linguistic
resources are language-dependent. The
source grammar essentially guides the
elicitation of the sentence semantic structure
into its corresponding UNL structure, by
determining RLs and ALs, always giving
priority to information content.
The UNL-NL decoding tool, or UNL
.Decoder, works in the opposite way to the
Encoder. Besides the lexicon and the
grammar, a cooccurrence dictionary is also
used at this stage, to disentangle lexical
choice. The target grammar is responsible for
the semantic-syntactic mapping, now
resolving semantic organization by making
syntactic and dependence choices between
UWs, taking RLs and ALs into account.

5. Remarks on language-independence
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957557142858">
The main strength of the UNL Project
rests on human expertise: language-specific
aspects to be included in the multilingual
KBMT system are handled by native
speakers of that language, in an attempt to
overcome the need of representing
knowledge across several languages or
cultures. It has been successful in developing
NL-driven resources and processes by
researchers all around the world. For
example, the BP UNL lexicon has over
65,000 entries that are categorized according
to grammatical and some semantic features,
and this will be extended considerably in the
future to cover the Portuguese vocabulary to
a greater extent. Up to the present time, only
decoding systems customized to each NL
have been plugged into a general decoder
skeleton (provided by the UNL Center) and
have already been assessed, producing
promising results. The BP decoder, for
example, is able to produce outputs whose
literal meaning is preserved in most cases
(Martins et al., 1998b), using handcoded
UNL expressions. Actually, to decode any
UNL text, NL-UNL encoding has to be
handmade, since customization of the UNL
Encoder to each NL has not yet been
undertaken in the project. In spite of the
promising decoding results, a) output quality
varies enormously with UNL sentences
encoding, which can be different across
distinct research groups; b) communicative
aspects of information exchange on the web
are not explored in depth, as it can be seen
through the list of RLs or ALs. UNL is not
knowledge intensive and there are no
guidelines as to consistently recognize or
extract such kind of information from the
surface of the source texts.
There are several reasons why
interpretation and use of the UNL among the
various teams are not uniform, including
cultural aspects and syntax differences of the
languages involved. Using English as the
lingua franca for communication and
cooperation among the research groups and
as the knowledge representation language has
also brought limitations into the Project,
since it implies a non-desirable level of
language-dependence. This is inevitable,
however, for limitations definitely come
along with the choice made. For example,
attaching a NL word to a UW may be
difficult, owing to the cross-references
introduced by using English to convey UNL
symbols. Resuming the example shown in
Figure 1, this is the case of the UW &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; in
(lb): the preposition &apos;on&apos; fills in the position
feature of the verb &apos;sit&apos; and, thus, is
represented in UNL correspondingly as the
second term of the binary relation &apos;plc&apos; and
the first term of &apos;obj&apos;. This, undoubtedly, is
critical, for &apos;sit&apos; can be juxtaposed to other
prepositions leading to different meanings,
which, in turn, may introduce different sets of
binary relations, implying a high-level
complexity in the UNL representation. As a
result, languages whose syntactic structures
deeply differ from the English ones may
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995828">
30
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935696969697">
present an additional level of complexity that
makes mapping to/from UNL impossible or
unrealistic. In this respect, we have not been
facing many problems in fitting Portuguese
structures with UNL ones, since Portuguese,
like English, is an inflectional language that
also employs prepositional constructions.
However, prepositions in Portuguese may
play considerably different roles compared to
English. Various extensions of the English
spatial prepositions &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;over&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;above&amp;quot;, for example, are subsumed in
Portuguese by a single form &amp;quot;sobre&amp;quot; (which
may also mean ..about). Therefore, in
Portuguese, cats could be, at the same time,
not only &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; but also &amp;quot;over&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;above&amp;quot;
mats. Only world knowledge, associated to
contextual indexes, both absent in the
referred UNL hypergraph, could avoid the
unsuited encodings The cat sat over the mat.
or The cat sat above the mat. from the
Portuguese sentence &amp;quot;0 gato sentou sobre o
tapete&amp;quot;.
Another problem related to the sentence
The cat sat on the mat. refers to the existence
of competing analyses: it is quite plausible
that a UNL representation suggesting a noun
phrase instead of a full sentence holds for this
sentence. It so happens when the arc between
&apos;sitting&apos; and &apos;cat&apos; concepts are labeled by the
RL &apos;obj&apos;, instead of the RL &apos;agt&apos; in (1), as it
is shown in Figure la&apos;, yielding the UNL text
shown in Figure lb&apos;.

Both analyses are equally accurate and
can lead to good NL surface expressions,
although they refer to different semantic
facts. Indeed, to define an object relationship
between &amp;quot;sitting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot; is to say that the
cat was already sat before the beginning of
the event (e.g., The cat sat on the mat ate the
fish.). In this case, the animal does not
actually perform the action, but is
conditioned to it, the main performer position
being empty, thus yielding the referred noun
phrase. In Figure 1, instead, the cat on its
own has taken the sitting position, therefore
introducing an agent relationship. These two
different semantic facts may correspond, in
English, to a single surface structure. Indeed,
(1) is orthographically identical to (1&apos;).
However, other languages (e.g., Portuguese)
do behave differently.
Although it is also possible to have, in
Portuguese, the same surface structure
corresponding to both UNL representations
(&amp;quot;sentado no tapete&amp;quot;), it is more feasible to
have, for each case, completely different
constructions. In the case depicted by Figure
1, the UW &amp;quot;sit&amp;quot; would be associated to the
verb &amp;quot;sentar&amp;quot; (corresponding to &amp;quot;to sit&amp;quot;).
Thus, the generation result should be
something like &amp;quot;0 gato sentou no tapete&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;0 gato sentado no tapete&amp;quot;. On the other
hand, for Figure 1&apos;, the same UW &apos;sit&apos; would
be generated in a completely different way,
corresponding to the passive form of the
Portuguese expression &amp;quot;colocar sentado&amp;quot; (to
be put in a skied position), for which there is
no adequate English surface expression.
Distinguishing such situations to cope
with syntactic-semantic troublesome
mappings, though interesting, is a highly

context-sensitive task, often surpassing
sentence boundaries. UNL descriptions do
not address such fine-grained level of
meaning representation, being limited to
meanings derived from context-free source
sentences, even when context-freeness
implies insufficient information. When this is
not possible, UNL offers a default analysis
for semantically ambiguous sentences, in
which case we can say that the UNL
representation is probabilistic, rather than
deterministic.
The way we believe some of UNL
limitations can be overcome and/or
minimized is by designing a fully-fledged
testing procedure to assess outputs of both
decoder and encoder for the various
languages. Since the same encoding and
decoding procedures have been delivered to
the UNL teams, it is possible that part of the
set of rules or translation strategies of a given
team may be interchangeable with another
one from a different language. In this way,
sharing procedures may become a warranty
for common ground assessment of the varied
models, in which case it may be possible to
make eligible concurrent strategies equally
available for the languages involved.
Concerning the UNL means to
disambiguate or proceed to reference
resolution or other discourse figures, most of
the troublesome occurrences are enclosed in
the treatment issued by specialists and, thus,
they are constrained to, and handled by, at the
level of native speakers use. This measure
can be somewhat fruitful, provided that each
signatory of the Project finds a way to trace a
UNL text back onto its own NL text or vice-
versa, making a proper use of the UNL
syntax or symbols. This, in fact, can be a
good method to evaluate (de)coding: once a
UNL code has been produced from any NL
text, this code can be the source to decoding
into the same NL, in order to compare the
original NL text with the automatically
generated one. Evaluation, in this case, can
be carried out by the same research group
responsible for both processes.
Compared to other interlingua approaches
(e.g., Mikrokosmos, Gazelle, or Kant), the
UNL Project is in a much earlier stage â€” most
of those are over 10 years old, while the UNL
one is about 3 years old â€” but it is much more
ambitious than most of the current systems
under construction. For UNL is actually a
front-end to a many-to-many communication
system, with no constraints that are normally
inherent in MT systems. Since knowledge is
specified by native speakers for each NL
module, grammar, semantics and world
knowledge can be well founded. Its
limitations, from a conceptual viewpoint, are
shared by most of its counterparts, as in
treating text at the sentence level only. In
addition, by no means is the UNL system
committed to event replication as it is the
case of human translation. Automatic
strategies have no psychological motivation
whatsoever and are solely based upon
computer efficiency principles, namely time
and space.

According to the UNL authors, it is possible to codify any sentence written in any NL into a corresponding UNL text expressing the sentence meaning through the use of the above RLs. This is still a claim to be verified, since cases of superposition and competition between different RLs have been observed, as it is discussed in Section 5. In addition to UWs and RLs, UNL makes use of predicate-like information, or Attribute Labels (ALs), which are names for event and concept &amp;quot;transformations&amp;quot;, in a sense very close to that intended by Chomsky (1957, 1965). They are not explicitly represented in a UNL hypergraph, although they are used to modify its nodes. ALs can convey information about concept intensions and extensions. In the former case, ALs name information about utterers&apos; intensions over either specific parts of a sentence (focus, topic, emphasis, theme) or the whole structure (exclamation, interrogation, invitation, recommendation, obligation, etc.). In the latter case, ALs refer to spatial (definite, indefinite, generic, plural) or temporal (past, present, future) information, or still, temporal external (begin-soon, beginjust, </context>
