In this paper, we study the problem of combining
a Chinese thesaurus with a Chinese dictionary by
linking the word entries in the thesaurus with the
word senses in the dictionary, and propose a
similar word strategy to solve the problem. The
method is based on the definitions given in the
dictionary, but without any syntactic parsing or
sense disambiguation on them at all. As a result,
their combination makes the thesaurus specify the
similarity between senses which accounts for the
similarity between words, produces a kind of
semantic classification of the senses defined in the
dictionary, and provides reliable information
about the lexical items on which the resources
don&apos;t conform with each other.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900826086957">
Both ((TongYiCi CiLin)) (Mei. et al, 1983) and
((XianDai HanYu CiDian)) (1978) are important
Chinese resources, and have been widely used in
various Chinese processing systems (e.g., Zhang
et al, 1995). As a thesaurus, ((TongYiCi CiLin))
defines semantic categories for words, however, it
doesn&apos;t specify which sense of a polysemous
word is involved in a semantic category. On the
other hand, ((XianDai HanYu CiDian)) is an
ordinary dictionary which provides definitions of
senses while not giving any information about
their semantic classification.
A manual effort has been made to build a
resource for English, i.e., WordNet, which
contains both definition and classification
information (Miller et al., 1990), but such
resources are not available for many other
languages, e.g. Chinese. This paper presents an
automatic method to combine the Chinese
thesaurus with the Chinese dictionary into such a
resource, by tagging the entries in the thesaurus
with appropriate senses in the dictionary,
meanwhile assigning appropriate semantic codes,
which stand for semantic categories in the
thesaurus, to the senses in the dictionary.
D.Yarowsky has considered a similar problem
to link Roget&apos;s categories, an English thesaurus,
with the senses in COBUILD, an English
dictionary (Yarowsky, 1992). He treats the
problem as a sense disambiguation one, with the
definitions in the dictionary taken as a kind of
contexts in which the headwords occur, and deals
with it based on a statistical model of Roget&apos;s
categories trained on large corpus. In our opinion,
the method, for a specific word, neglects the
difference between its definitions and the ordinary
contexts: definitions generally contain its
synonyms, hyponyms or hypernyms, etc., while
ordinary contexts generally its collocations. So
the trained model on ordinary contexts may be not
appropriate for the disambiguation problem in
definition contexts.
A seemingly reasonable method to the
problem would be common word strategy, which
has been extensively studied by many researchers
(e.g., Knight, 1993; Lesk, 1986). The solution
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994014">
600
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991936">
would be, for a category, to select those senses
whose definitions hold most number of common
words among all those for its member words. But
the words in a category in the Chinese thesaurus
may be not similar in a strict way, although
similar to some extend, so their definitions may
only contain some similar words at most, rather
than share many words. As a result, the common
word strategy may be not appropriate for the
problem we study here.
In this paper, we extend the idea of common
word strategy further to a similar word method
based on the intuition that definitions for similar
senses generally contain similar words, if not the
same ones. Now that the words in a category in
the thesaurus are similar to some extent, some of
their definitions should contain similar words. We
see these words as marks of the category, then the
correct sense of a word involved in the category
could be identified by checking whether its
definition contains such marks. So the key of the
method is to determine the marks for a category.
Since the marks may be different word tokens, it
may be difficult to make them out only based on
their frequencies. But since they are similar words,
they would belong to the same category in the
thesaurus, or hold the same semantic code, so we
can locate them by checking their semantic codes.
In implementation, for any category, we first
compute a salience value for each code with
respect to it, which in fact provides the
information about the marks of the category, then
compute distances between the category and the
senses of its member words, which reflect
whether their definitions contain the marks and
how many, finally select those senses as tags by
checking whether their distances from the
category fall within a threshold.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
the following: in section 2, we give a formal
setting of the problem and present the tagging
procedure; in section 3, we explore the issue of
threshold estimation for the distances between
senses and categories based on an analysis of the
distances between the senses and categories of
univocal words; in section 4, we report our
experiment results and their evaluation; in section
5, we present some discussions about our
methodology; finally in section 6, we give some
conclusions.

2. Problem Setting
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997016307692308">
The Chinese dictionary provides sense
distinctions for 44,389 Chinese words, on the
other hand, the Chinese thesaurus divides 64,500
word entries into 12 major, 94 medium and 1428
minor categories, which is in fact a kind of
semantic classification of the words&apos;. Intuitively,
there should be a kind of correspondence between
the senses and the entries. The main task of
combining the two resources is to locate such kind
of correspondence.
Suppose X is a category2 in the thesaurus, for
any word we X, let Sw be the set of its senses in
the dictionary, and Sx = , for any SE Sx, let

the following text, if no confusion is involved. Furthermore,
we also use a semantic code to refer to a category.
A category is given a semantic code, a word may belong to
several categories, and hold several codes.

To define a distance between a category X and a

two categories according to the distribution of

80 million Chinese characters.
For any category X, suppose its members are

mutual information with each semantic code

select 10 top semantic codes as its environmental
codes6, which hold the biggest mutual information

codes, CT be the set of all the semantic codes
given in the thesaurus, for any ce C7-, we define its
context salience with respect to X in 4).

Igaodar is the Pinyin of the word, and &amp;quot;high and big&amp;quot; is its

5 We see each occurrence of a word in the corpus as one
occurrence of its codes. Each co-occurrence of a word and a
code falls within a 5-word distance.
6 The intuition behind the parameter selection (10) is that the
words which can combined with a specific word to form
collocations fall in at most 10 categories in the thesaurus.

define their distance dis(X, Y) as 6) based on the
cosine of the two vectors.

Intuitively, if CODE, contains the salient
codes with respect to X, i.e., those with higher
salience with respect to X, dis(X, s) will be
smaller due to the fact that the contribution of a
semantic code to the distance increases with its
salience, so s tends to be a correct sense tag of
some word.
For any category X, let we X and se Sâ€ž,, if

Now we consider the problem of estimating an

the dictionary&apos;, then check the distances between
these senses and categories. The number of such
words is 22,028.

<bodyText confidence="0.999940578947368">
The object function is built on the following
inference. About the explanation of the words
which are regarded as univocal by both Chinese
resources, the two resources tend to be in
accordance with each other. It means that for most
univocal words, their senses should be the correct
tags of their entries, or the distance between their
categories and senses should be smaller, falling
within the under-specified threshold. So it is
reasonable to suppose that the intervals within the
threshold hold a higher point density, furthermore
that the difference between the point density in [0,
a and that in [t*, 1] gets the biggest value.
With t falling in its value set {dis(X, s)}, we
get ts as 0.384, when for 18,653 (84.68%)
univocal words, their unique entries are tagged
with their unique senses, and for the other
univocal words, their entries not tagged with their
senses.

where RTE is a set of the sense tags for the entries
in E produced by the tagging procedure, and CTE
is a set of the sense tags for the entries in E, which
are regarded as correct ones somehow.
What we expect for the tagging procedure is
to select the appropriate sense tags for the entries
in the thesaurus, if they really exist in the
dictionary. To evaluate the procedure directly
proves to be difficult. We turn to deal with it in an
indirect way, in particular, we explore the
efficiency of the procedure of tagging the entries,
when their appropriate sense tags don&apos;t exist in
the dictionary. This indirect evaluation, on the one
hand, can be carried out automatically in a large
scale, on the other hand, can suggest what the
direct evaluation entails in some way because that
none appropriate tags can be seen as a special tag
for the entries, say None9.
In the first experiment, let&apos;s consider the
18,653 univocal words again which are selected in
parameter estimation stage. For each of them, we
create a new entry in the thesaurus which is
different from its original one. Based on the
analysis in section 3, the senses for theses words
should only be the correct tags for their
corresponding entries, the newly created ones
have to take None as their correct tags.
When creating new entries, we adopt the
following 3 different kinds of constraints:
i) the new entry belongs to the same
medium category with the original one;
ii) the new entry belongs to the same
major category with the original one;
iii) no constraints;
With each constraint, we select 5 groups of new

From Tab. 4, we can see that the accuracy rate

a bit more likely for them to be tagged with the
original senses. On the other hand, notice that the
accuracy rates and loss rates in Tab.4 are
complementary with each other, the reason is that
IRTEI equals ICTEI in such cases.
In another experiment, we select 5 groups of
0-tag, 1-tag and 2-tag entries respectively, and

The main reasons are:
i) No salient codes exist with respect to a
category, or the determined are not the expected.
This may be attributed to the fact that the words in
a category may be not strict synonyms, or that a
category may contain too less words, etc.
ii) The information provided for a word by
the resources may be incomplete. For example,
word f( (/quanshuf, all) holds one semantic
code Ka06 in the thesaurus, its definition in the
dictionary is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.910664">
[Eb02]
/quanshu/ /quanbu/
all
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.974821393939394">
The correct tag for the entry should be the sense
listed above, but in fact, it is tagged with None in
the experiment. The reason is that word ifil ;
(/quanbu/, all) can be an adverb or an adjective,
and should hold two semantic codes, Ka06 and
Eb02, corresponding with its adverb and adjective
usage respectively, but the thesaurus neglects its
adverb usage. If Ka06 is added as a semantic code
of word Â±U (/quanbu/, all), the entry will be
successfully tagged with the expected sense.
iii) The distance defined between a sense and
a category fails to capture the information carried
by the order of salient codes, more generally, the
information carried by syntactic structures
involved. As an example, consider word t{
(/yaochuan/), which has two definitions listed in
the following.
im 1) lin[Da19] M[Ie01].
/yaochuan/ /yaoyan/ /chuanbo/
hearsay spread
the hearsay spreads.
2) 4iA[Ie01] M igli[Da19]
/chuanbo/ /de/ /yaoyan/
spread of hearsay
the hearsay which spreads
The two definitions contain the same content
words, the difference between them lies in the
order of the content words, more generally, lies in
the syntactic structures involved in the definitions:
the former presents a sub-obj structure, while the
latter with a &amp;quot;IM/de/,of)&amp;quot; structure. To distinguish
such definitions needs to give more consideration
on word order or syntactic structures.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.997635" genericHeader="evaluation">
5. Discussions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998881580645161">
In the tagging procedure, we don&apos;t try to carry out
any sense disambiguation on definitions due to its
known difficulty. Undoubtedly, when the noisy
semantic codes taken by some definition words
exactly cover the salient ones of a category, they
will affect the tagging accuracy. But the
probability for such cases may be lower,
especially when more than one salient code exists
with respect to a category.
The distance between two categories is
defined according to the distribution of their
member words in a corpus. A natural alternative is
based on the shortest path from one category to
another in the thesaurus (e.g., Lee at al., 1993;
Rada et al., 1989), but it is known that the method
suffers from the problem of neglecting the wide
variability in what a link in the thesaurus entails.
Another choice may be information content
method (Resnik, 1995), although it can avoid the
difficulty faced by shortest path methods, it will
make the minor categories within a medium one
get a same distance between each other, because
the distance is defined in terms of the information
content carried by the medium category. What we
concern here is to evaluate the dissimilarity
between different categories, including those
within one medium category, so we make use of
semantic code based vectors to define their
dissimilarity, which is motivated by Shuetze&apos;s
word frequency based vectors (Shuetze, 1993).
In order to determine appropriate sense tags
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997091">
605
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984777777778">
for a word entry in one category, we estimate a
threshold for the distance between a sense and a
category. Another natural choice may be to select
the sense holding the smallest distance from the
category as the correct tag for the entry. But this
choice, although avoiding estimation issues, will
fail to directly demonstrate the inconsistency
between the two resources, and the similarity
between two senses with respect to a category.

6. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963037037037">
In this paper, we propose an automatic method to
combine a Chinese thesaurus with a Chinese
dictionary. Their combination establishes the
correspondence between the entries in the
thesaurus and the senses in the dictionary, and
provides reliable information about the lexical
items on which the two resources are not in
accordance with each other. The method uses no
language-specific knowledge, and can be applied
to other languages.
The combination of the two resources can be
seen as improvement on both of them. On the one
hand, it makes the thesaurus specify the similarity
between word senses behind that between words,
on the other hand, it produces a semantic
classification for the word senses in the
dictionary.
The method is in fact appropriate for a more
general problem: given a set of similar words,
how to identify the senses, among all, which
account for their similarity. In the problem we
consider here, the words fall within a category in
the Chinese thesaurus, with similarity to some
extent between each other. The work suggests that
if the set contains more words, and they are more
similar with each other, the result will be more
sound.

<abstract confidence="0.999383625">In this paper, we study the problem of combining a Chinese thesaurus with a Chinese dictionary by linking the word entries in the thesaurus with the word senses in the dictionary, and propose a similar word strategy to solve the problem. The method is based on the definitions given in the dictionary, but without any syntactic parsing or sense disambiguation on them at all. As a result, their combination makes the thesaurus specify the similarity between senses which accounts for the similarity between words, produces a kind of semantic classification of the senses defined in the dictionary, and provides reliable information about the lexical items on which the resources don&apos;t conform with each other.</abstract>

In our opinion, the method, for a specific word, neglects the difference between its definitions and the ordinary contexts: definitions generally contain its synonyms, hyponyms or hypernyms, etc., while ordinary contexts generally its collocations. So the trained model on ordinary contexts may be not appropriate for the disambiguation problem in definition contexts. A seemingly reasonable method to the problem would be common word strategy, which has been extensively studied by many researchers (e.g., Knight, 1993; Lesk, 1986).

As a thesaurus, ((TongYiCi CiLin)) defines semantic categories for words, however, it doesn&apos;t specify which sense of a polysemous word is involved in a semantic category. On the other hand, ((XianDai HanYu CiDian)) is an ordinary dictionary which provides definitions of senses while not giving any information about their semantic classification. A manual effort has been made to build a resource for English, i.e., WordNet, which contains both definition and classification information (Miller et al., 1990), but such resources are not available for many other languages, e.g. Chinese. This paper presents an automatic method to combine the Chinese thesaurus with the Chinese dictionary into such a resource, by tagging the entries in the thesaurus with appropriate senses in the dictionary, meanwhile assigning appropriate semantic codes, which stand for semantic categories in the thesaurus, to the senses in the dictionary. D.Yarowsky has considered a similar problem to link Roget&apos;s categories, an English thesaurus, with the senses in COBUILD, an English dictionary (Yarowsky, 1992). He treats the prob</context>

But the probability for such cases may be lower, especially when more than one salient code exists with respect to a category. The distance between two categories is defined according to the distribution of their member words in a corpus. A natural alternative is based on the shortest path from one category to another in the thesaurus (e.g., Lee at al., 1993; Rada et al., 1989), but it is known that the method suffers from the problem of neglecting the wide variability in what a link in the thesaurus entails. Another choice may be information content method (Resnik, 1995), although it can avoid the difficulty faced by shortest path methods, it will make the minor categories within a medium one get a same distance between each other, because the distance is defined in terms of the information content carried by the medium category. What we concern here is to evaluate the dissimilarity between different categories, including those within one medium category, so we make use of semantic code based vectors to define their dissimilarity, which is motivated by Shuetze&apos;s word frequency based vectors (Shuetze, 1993).
