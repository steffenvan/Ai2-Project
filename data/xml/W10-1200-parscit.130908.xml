Welcome to the NAACL HLT Workshop on Semantic Search!
Information retrieval (IR) research has been actively driven by the challenging information overload
problem and many successful general-purpose commercial search engines. While the popularity of the
largest search engines is a confirmation of the success and utility of IR, the identification, representation,
and use of the often-complex semantics behind user queries has not yet been fully explored.
In this workshop we target methods that exploit semantics in search-related tasks. One of the major
obstacles in bridging the gap between IR and Natural Language Processing (NLP) is how to retain the
flexibility and precision of working with text at the lexical level while gaining the greater descriptive
precision that NLP provides. We have solicited contributions on automatic analysis of queries and
documents in order to encode and exploit information beyond surface-level keywords: named entities,
relations, semantic roles, etc.
This workshop is meant to accelerate the pace of progress in semantic search techniques by connecting
IR and NLP, bridging semantic analysis and search methodologies, and exploring the potentials of
search utilizing semantics. We also focus on forming an interest group from different areas of research,
exploring collaboration opportunities, providing deeper insight into bringing semantics into search, and
provoking or encouraging discussions on all of its potential.
We are interested in semantic search technologies including the following topics:

<listItem confidence="0.981826727272727">
- Query Parsing and Semantic Tagging
- Query Suggestion and Recommendation
- Query Expansion and Intention Detection
- Web Query Analysis and Mining
- Semantic Annotation and Indexing
- Language Modeling for Information Retrieval
- Information Extraction and Summarization for Indexing and Search
- Question Answering
- Search Reranking Integrating Semantic Features
- Search Relevance Evaluation using Semantic Technology
- Topic Modeling and Semantic Tagging

We received 11 submissions and selected 6 papers after a rigorous review process. Each paper has been
reviewed by at least three reviewers. We are pleased to present these papers in this volume.
Our workshop will start with a keynote speech by Ronald Kaplan (Powerset Division of Microsoft
Bing). We will also hold a panel discussion on the potential to explore semantic search technologies.
We are very grateful to the Program Committee for their hard work, and the presenters for their excellent
papers.
