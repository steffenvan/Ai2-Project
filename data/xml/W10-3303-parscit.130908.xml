<bodyText confidence="0.999986235294118">
We are describing the construction
process of a specialized multilingual
lexical resource dedicated for the ar-
chive of the Digital Silk Road DSR. The
DSR project creates digital archives of
cultural heritage along the historical Silk
Road; more than 116 of basic references
on Silk Road have been digitized and
made available online. These books are
written in various languages and attract
people from different linguistic back-
ground, therefore, we are trying to build
a multilingual repository for the termi-
nology of the DSR to help its users, and
increase the accessibility of these books.
The construction of a terminological da-
tabase using a classical approach is dif-
ficult and expensive. Instead, we are in-
troducing specialized lexical resources
that can be constructed by the commu-
nity and its resources; we call it Multi-
lingual Preterminological Graphs
MPGs. We build such graphs by ana-
lyzing the access log files of the website
of the Digital Silk Road. We aim at
making this graph as a seed repository
so multilingual volunteers can contrib-
ute. We have used the access log files
of the DSR since its beginning in 2003,
and obtained an initial graph of around
116,000 terms. As an application, We
have used this graph to obtain a preter-
minological multilingual database that
has a number of applications.

<bodyText confidence="0.999987291666667">
This paper describes the design and develop-
ment of a specialized multilingual lexical re-
source for the archive constructed and main-
tained by the Digital Silk Road project. The
Digital Silk Road project (NII 2003) is an initia-
tive started by the National Institute of Infor-
matics (Tokyo/Japan) in 2002, to archive cul-
tural historical resources along the Silk Road,
by digitizing them and making them available
and accessible online.
One of the most important sub-projects is the
Digital Archive of Toyo Bunko Rare Books
(NII 2008) where 116 (30,091 pages) of old rare
books available at Toyo Bunko library have
been digitized using OCR (Optical Character
Recognition) technology. The digitized collec-
tion contains books from nine languages includ-
ing English. The website of the project attracts
visitors from the domain of history, archeology,
and people who are interested in cultural heri-
tage. It provides services of reading and search-
ing the books of Toyo Bunko, along with vari-
ety of services. Table 1 shows the countries
from which DSR is being accessed. The table

shows that around 60% of visitors are coming
from countries other than Japan. The diversity
of the visitors’ linguistic backgrounds suggests
two things: 1) Monolingual translation service is
not enough. 2) It shows that we can benefit from
allowing them to contribute to a multilingual
repository. So we design and build a collabora-
tive multilingual terminological database and
seed using the DSR project and its resources
(Daoud, Kitamoto et al. 2008). However, Dis-
covering and translating domain specific termi-
nology is a very complicated and expensive
task, because (1) traditionally, it depends on
human terminologists (Cabre and Sager 1999)
which increases the cost, (2) terminology is dy-
namic (Kageura 2002), thousands of terms are
coined each year, and (3) it is difficult to in-
volve domain experts in the construction proc-
ess. That will not only increase the cost, but it
will reduce the quality, and the coverage (num-
ber of languages and size). Databases like (UN-
Geo 2002; IATE 2008; UN 2008) are built by
huge organizations, and it is difficult for a
smaller community to produce its own multilin-
gual terminological database.

Terminological sphere of a domain is the set of
terms related to that domain. A smaller set of
that sphere is well documented and available in
dictionaries and terminological databases such
as (FAO 2008; IEC 2008; IDRC 2009)... How-
ever, the majority of terms are not multilingual-
ized, nor stored into a database, even though,
they may be used and translated by the commu-
nity and domain experts. This situation is shown
in Figure 1, where the majority of terms are in
area B. Preterminological sphere (area B) of a
domain is a set of terms (preterms) related to
the domain and used by the community but it
might not be documented and included in tradi-
tional lexical databases.

<figureCaption confidence="0.86999">

<bodyText confidence="0.999625823529412">
Every year thousands of terms are coined and
introduced in correspondence to new concepts,
scientific discoveries or social needs. Most of
these terms are produced in the top dominant
languages, i.e. English. Interested people from
different linguistic backgrounds would find
suitable translations to new terms and use it
amongst them. For example, the term ‘status
update’ is used by people who visit social net-
working websites like facebook.com. Transla-
tion of this term to Arabic might not be avail-
able in area A of Figure 1. However the Arabic
community found a translation that is acceptable
which is 11_�� ,&gt;,�,_;. So this term is in the area B.
We are trying to use what is in area A, and what
can be contributed from B to build preterminol-
ogy (Daoud, Boitet et al. 2009).

2.2 Structure of MPG
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99982875">
We are building preterminological resource as a
lexical network (graph) to handle the diversity
of the resources that we use. A multilingual pre-
terminological graph MPG(N,E) is a finite non-
empty set N={n1,n2, ...} of objects called
Nodes together with a set E={e1,e2, ...} of un-
ordered pairs of distinct nodes of MPG called
edges. This definition is based on the general
definition of a graph at the following references
(Even 1979; Loerch 2000). MPG of domain X,
contains possible multilingual terms related to
that domain connected to each other with rela-
tions. A multilingual lexical unit and its transla-
tions in different languages are represented as
connected nodes with labels.
In an MPG the set of nodes N consists of p,l,
s, occ, where p is the string of the preterm, l is
the language, s is the code of the first source of
the preterm, and occ is the number of occur-
rences. Note that l could be undefined. For ex-
ample: N={[silk road, en, log],[Great Wall of China, en,
,wikipedia, 5], [L:���ا, ar, contributorx,6]}, here we have
three nodes, 2 of them are English and one in
Arabic, each term came from a different source.
Note that English and Arabic terms belong to
the same N thus, the same MPG.
An Edge e={n, v} is a pair of nodes adjacent in
an MPG. An edge represents a relation between
two preterms represented by their nodes. The
nature of the relation varies. However, edges are
weighted with several weights (described be-
low) to indicate the possible nature of this rela-
tion.
The following are the weights that label the
edges on an MPG: Relation Weights rw: For an
edge e={[p1,l1,s1], [p2,l2,s2]}, rw indicates
that there is a relation between the preterm p1
and p2. The nature of the relation could not be
assumed by rw. Translation Weights tw: For an
edge e={[p1,l1,s1], [p2,l2,s2]}, tw suggests that
p1 in language l1 is a translation of p2 in lan-
guage l2. Synonym Weights sw: For an edge
e={[p1,l1,s1], [p2,l1,s2]}, sw suggests that p1
and p2 are synonyms.

3 Automatic Initialization of DSR-
MPG
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999734769230769">
Basically we seeded DSR-MPG, through two
steps, the firs one is the automatic seeding,
which consists of the following: 1) Initialization
by finding interesting terms used to search the
website of the DSR. 2) Multilingualization, us-
ing online resources. 3) Graph Expansion using
the structure of the graph it self. The second
step is the progressive enhancement, by receiv-
ing contributions from users, through set of use-
ful applications. In this section we will discuss
the first three steps. In section 4, we will discuss
the human factor in the development of DSR-
MPG.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99994">
3.1 Analyzing Access Log Files
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973846153846">
We analyze two kinds of access requests that
can provide us with information to enrich the
MPG: (1) requests made to the local search en-
gine of DSR (2) requests from web-based
search engine (like Google, Yahoo!...). These
requests provide the search terms that visitors
used to access the website. Moreover, we can
understand the way users interpret a concept
into lexical units. For example, if we find that
five different users send two search requests t1
and t2, then there is a possibility that t1 and t2
have a relation. The graph constructor analyzes
the requests to make the initial graph by creat-
ing edges between terms in the same session.
rw(x,y), is set to the number of sessions contain-
ing x and y within the log file.
For example, rw(x,y) = 10 means that 10
people thought about x and y within the same
search session. Figure 2 shows an example of a
produced graph. The method did not discover
the kind of relation between the terms. But it
discovered that there is a relation, for example,
three users requested results for “yang” fol-
lowed by “yin” within the same session. Hence,
edge with weight of 2 was constructed based on
this.

3.2 Multilingualization Using Online Re-
sources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98716835483871">
Many researchers focused on the usage of dic-
tionaries in digital format to translate lexical
resources automatically (Gopestake, Briscoe et
al. 1994) (Etzioni, Reiter et al. 2007). We are
concerned with the automatic utilization of
these resources to acquire multilingual preter-
minological resources through the following: 1)
Wikipedia 2) online MT systems 3) online dic-
tionaries.
Wikipedia (Wikipedia-A 2008) is a rich
source of preterminology, it has good linguistic
and lexical coverage. As of December, 2009,
there are 279 Wikipedias in different languages,
and 14,675,872 articles. There are 29 Wikipe-
dias with more that 100000 articles and 91 lan-
guages have more than 10,000 articles. Beside,
Wikipedia is built by domain experts. We ex-
ploit the structure of Wikipedia to seed an
MPG, by selecting a root set of terms, for each
one of them we fetch its wikipedia article, and
then we use the language roll of the article. For
example, we fetch the article (Cuneiform script)
En: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform script, to reach its
translation in Arabic from this url:
http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/ -رL— _4z
We use also online machine translation sys-
tems as general purpose MRDs. One of the
main advantages of MT systems is the good
coverage even for multiword terms. The agree-
ment of some MT systems with other resources
on the translation of one term enhanced the con-

In a similar way, we used several online re-
positories; to make good use of what is avail-
able and standardized, to initializing the MPG
with various resources, and to construct a meta-
system to call online dictionaries automatically.
We used IATE (IATE 2008) as an example of a
terminological db, and Google dictionary
(Google 2008). The concept is similar to the
concept of using online translations, where we
construct an http request, to receive the result as
html page.

3.3 Graph Expansion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934444444444">
And then, the Graph is expanded by finding the
synonyms according to formula (1) described at
(Daoud, Boitet et al. 2009). After finding syno-
nyms we assume that synonyms share the same
translations. As Figure 4 shows, X1 and X2 have
translations overlaps, and relatively high rw, so
that suggest they are synonyms. Therefore we
constructed heuristic edges between the transla-
tions of X1 and X2.

After initializing the graph, we target contribu-
tions from the visitors to the DSR website. In
this section we will start by analyzing the possi-

applications on the DSR-MPG that can help the

4.1 Analyzing Possible Contributors of the
DSR
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999326">
We are trying to analyze access log files to find
out the possible contributors to a pretermi-
nological multilingual graph dedicated to an
online community. This kind of information is
necessary for the following reasons: 1) it pro-
vide feasibility analysis predicting the possibil-
ity of receiving contribution to a multilingual
preterminological repository. 2) it gives infor-
mation that can be used by the collaborative
environment to personalize the contribution
process for those who prove to be able to con-
tribute.
In the analysis process we are using the fol-
lowing information that can be easily extracted
the access records:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999899571428571">
• Key terms to access the historical resources of
the Digital Silk Road, whether it is the local
search engine, or any external search engine.
• Access frequency: number of access requests
by a visitor over a period of time.
• Language preferences
• Period of visits
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999682">
Knowing these points helps determining the
possible users who might be willing to contrib-
ute. A contributor should satisfy the following
characteristics: 1) Loyalty 2) Multilinguality. A
multilingual user is a visitor who uses multilin-
gual search terms to access the online resources.
We rank users based on their linguistic compe-
tence, we measure that by tracking users’ search
requests, and matching them with the multilin-
gual preterminological graph, users with higher
matches in certain pair of languages are ranked
higher. A loyal user is a user who visits the web
site frequently and stays longer than other users.
Users based on how many months they accessed
the website more that k times.

4.2 DSR-MPG Applications

<bodyText confidence="0.999931777777778">
For a historical archive like the DSR, we find
that reading and searching where the most im-
portant for users. Log files since 2003 shows
that 80% of the project visitors were interested
in reading the historical records. Moreover,
around 140000 search requests have been sent
to the internal search engine. So we imple-
mented two applications (1) “contribute-while-
reading” and (2) “contribute-while-searching”.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.853231">
4.2.1 Contribute While Searching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995216058823529">
Physical books have been digitized and indexed
into a search engine. We expect users to send
monolingual search requests in any language
supported by our system to get multilingual an-
swers. Having a term base of multilingual
equivalences could achieve this (Chen 2002). A
bilingual user who could send a bilingual search
request could be a valid candidate to contribute.
We plan that users who use our search engine
will use the DSR-pTMDB to translate their re-
quests and will contribute to the graph sponta-
neously. As Figure 5 shows, a user would trans-
late the search request, during the searching
process; the user can ask to add new translation
if s/he was not happy with the suggested transla-
tion, by clicking on “Add Suggestions” to view
a contribution page.

The other application is trying to help users
from different linguistic backgrounds to trans-
late some of the difficult terms into their lan-
guages while they are reading, simply by select-
ing a term from the screen. As shown in Figure
6, readers will see a page from a book as an im-
age, with its OCR text. Important terms will be
presented with yellow background. Once a term
is clicked, a small child contribution/lookup
window will be open, similar. Also user can
lookup/translate any term from the screen by
selecting it. This application helps covering all
the important terms of each book.
After multilingualization, the graph has 210,781
nodes containing terms from the most important
languages. The graph has now 779,765 edges
with tw &gt; 0. The important languages are the
languages of the majority of the visitors, the
languages of the archived books, and represen-
tative languages a long the Silk Road. DSR-
MPG achieved high linguistic coverage as 20
languages have more than 1000 nodes on the
graph. To evaluate the produced graph, we ex-
tracted 350 English terms manually from the

from December 2003 to January 2009. The ini-
tial graph after normalization contained 89,076
nodes. Also we extracted 81,204 terms using
Yahoo terms. 27,500 of them were not discov-

We assume that the terms available in these
books are strongly related to the DSR. Hence,
we tried to translate them into Arabic and
French. Figure 7 compares between DSR-MPG,
and various general purpose dictionaries. Out of
the 350 terms, we found 189 correct direct
translations into Arabic. However, the number
reached 214 using indirect translations. On the
other hand, the closest to our result was PanI-
mages, which uses Wikitionaries and various
dictionaries, with only 83 correct translations.
DSR-MPG1 is the translations obtained from
formula 1, DSR-MPG2 represents the transla-
tions obtained from indirect translations, which
increased the amount of correct translation by

25 terms in the case of En-Ar. The result can be
progressively enhanced by accepting contribu-
tions from volunteers through the applications
we described in the section three and the generic
nature of MPG makes it easy to accept contribu-
tions from any dictionary or terminological da-
tabase.
Around 55200 root English terms were used
as a seed set of terms; these terms were selected
from the initial DSR-MPG. Around 35000
terms have been translated from Wikipedia into
at least 1 language, mostly in French, German.
Wikipedia increased the density of the graph by
introducing around 113,000 edges (with tw).

With K=2, meaning that a multilinguality com-
petence is counted only if the two terms sent by
a user has to have more than 2 points of transla-
tion weight on the MPG.
The highest score was 33, achieved by this
IP: p27250-adsao05douji-acca.osaka.ocn.ne.jp.
That means that this user sent 33 multilingual
search requests. We have another 115 users with
score higher than 5.
For example, the following two request, sent by
one user:
p27250-adsao05douji-acca.osaka.ocn.ne.jp
&amp;input=peshawar
p27250-adsao05douji-acca.osaka.ocn.ne.jp
&amp;input=ペシャワール
On the DSR-MPG the translation weight be-
tween peshawer and ペシャワール = 5, thus
this IP earned a point. With k=10, means that a
user should send 10 requests to earn a loyalty
point, only 309 users earned 12 point (for 12
months), 43 of them has more than 3 points.

6 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.995588176470588">
We presented our work in constructing a new
lexical resource that can handle multilingual
terms based on the historical archive of the
Digital Silk Road. Multilingual Preterminologi-
cal Graphs (MPGs) are constructed based on
domain dedicated resources, and based on vol-
unteer contributions.
Figure 10. DSR preterminology
It compiles terms available in the pretermi-
nological sphere of a domain. In this article we
defined the framework of the construction of
preterminology, and we described the approach
for using access log files to initialize such pre-
terminological resource by finding the trends in
the search requests used to access the resources
of an online community. Aiming at a standard-
ized multilingual repository is very expensive

and difficult. Instead of that, MPGs tries to use
all available contributions. This way will en-
hance the linguistic and informational coverage,
and tuning the weights (tw, rw, and sw) will
give indications for the confidence of the trans-
lation equivalences, as the tedges accumulate
the agreements of the contributors and MDRs
(online resources).
We used the resources of the Digital Silk
Road Project to construct a DSR-MPG and
some applications that attract further contribu-
tion to the MPG. DSR-MPG achieved high lin-
guistic and informational coverage compared to
other general purpose dictionaries, Figure 10.
Furthermore, the generic structure of the MPG
makes it possible to accept volunteer contribu-
tions, and it facilitates further study of comput-
ing more lexical functions and ontological rela-
tions between the terms. We made a study on
the possibility of receiving contributions from
users, by analyzing the access log file to find
multilinguality and loyalty of the DSR visitors;
we found 115 users with the needed linguistic
capacity 43 of them scored high loyalty points.
This gives an indication of the future of the con-
tributions. These measures are just estimations
and expected to go high with the help of the
MPG-DSR applications.

<abstract confidence="0.999698">We are describing the construction process of a specialized multilingual lexical resource dedicated for the archive of the Digital Silk Road DSR. The DSR project creates digital archives of cultural heritage along the historical Silk Road; more than 116 of basic references on Silk Road have been digitized and made available online. These books are written in various languages and attract people from different linguistic background, therefore, we are trying to build a multilingual repository for the terminology of the DSR to help its users, and increase the accessibility of these books. The construction of a terminological database using a classical approach is difficult and expensive. Instead, we are introducing specialized lexical resources that can be constructed by the community and its resources; we call it Multilingual Preterminological Graphs MPGs. We build such graphs by analyzing the access log files of the website of the Digital Silk Road. We aim at making this graph as a seed repository so multilingual volunteers can contribute. We have used the access log files of the DSR since its beginning in 2003, and obtained an initial graph of around 116,000 terms. As an application, We have used this graph to obtain a preterminological multilingual database that has a number of applications.</abstract>

The initial graph after normalization contained 89,076 nodes. Also we extracted 81,204 terms using Yahoo terms. 27,500 of them were not discovered from the access files. So, the total number of nodes in the initial graph was 116,576 nodes, see Figure 7 for sample nodes. Figure 7. A comparison between DSR-MPG, and other dictionaries. The En-Ar bi-dictionary is Babylon (Babylon 2009), and the En-Fr bidictionary was IATE. We assume that the terms available in these books are strongly related to the DSR. Hence, we tried to translate them into Arabic and French. Figure 7 compares between DSR-MPG, and various general purpose dictionaries. Out of the 350 terms, we found 189 correct direct translations into Arabic. However, the number reached 214 using indirect translations. On the other hand, the closest to our result was PanImages, which uses Wikitionaries and various dictionaries, with only 83 correct translations.

The diversity of the visitors’ linguistic backgrounds suggests two things: 1) Monolingual translation service is not enough. 2) It shows that we can benefit from allowing them to contribute to a multilingual repository. So we design and build a collaborative multilingual terminological database and seed using the DSR project and its resources (Daoud, Kitamoto et al. 2008). However, Discovering and translating domain specific terminology is a very complicated and expensive task, because (1) traditionally, it depends on human terminologists (Cabre and Sager 1999) which increases the cost, (2) terminology is dynamic (Kageura 2002), thousands of terms are coined each year, and (3) it is difficult to involve domain experts in the construction process. That will not only increase the cost, but it will reduce the quality, and the coverage (number of languages and size). Databases like (UNGeo 2002; IATE 2008; UN 2008) are built by huge organizations, and it is difficult for a smaller community to produce its own multilingual terminological database.

We expect users to send monolingual search requests in any language supported by our system to get multilingual answers. Having a term base of multilingual equivalences could achieve this (Chen 2002). A bilingual user who could send a bilingual search request could be a valid candidate to contribute. We plan that users who use our search engine will use the DSR-pTMDB to translate their requests and will contribute to the graph spontaneously. As Figure 5 shows, a user would translate the search request, during the searching process; the user can ask to add new translation if s/he was not happy with the suggested translation, by clicking on “Add Suggestions” to view a contribution page.

MPG of domain X, contains possible multilingual terms related to that domain connected to each other with relations. A multilingual lexical unit and its translations in different languages are represented as connected nodes with labels. In an MPG the set of nodes N consists of p,l, s, occ, where p is the string of the preterm, l is the language, s is the code of the first source of the preterm, and occ is the number of occurrences.

A smaller set of that sphere is well documented and available in dictionaries and terminological databases such as (FAO 2008; IEC 2008; IDRC 2009)... However, the majority of terms are not multilingualized, nor stored into a database, even though, they may be used and translated by the community and domain experts. This situation is shown in Figure 1, where the majority of terms are in area B. Preterminological sphere (area B) of a domain is a set of terms (preterms) related to the domain and used by the community but it might not be documented and included in traditional lexical databases.

MPG sample nodes In a similar way, we used several online repositories; to make good use of what is available and standardized, to initializing the MPG with various resources, and to construct a metasystem to call online dictionaries automatically. We used IATE (IATE 2008) as an example of a terminological db, and Google dictionary (Google 2008). The concept is similar to the concept of using online translations, where we construct an http request, to receive the result as html page. 3.3 Graph Expansion And then, the Graph is expanded by finding the synonyms according to formula (1) described at (Daoud, Boitet et al. 2009). After finding synonyms we assume that synonyms share the same translations. As Figure 4 shows, X1 and X2 have translations overlaps, and relatively high rw, so that suggest they are synonyms. Therefore we constructed heuristic edges between the translations of X1 and X2. 22 Figure 4. Graph expansion 4 Human Involv</context>

A multilingual preterminological graph MPG(N,E) is a finite nonempty set N={n1,n2, ...} of objects called Nodes together with a set E={e1,e2, ...} of unordered pairs of distinct nodes of MPG called edges. This definition is based on the general definition of a graph at the following references (Even 1979; Loerch 2000). MPG of domain X, contains possible multilingual terms related to that domain connected to each other with relations. A multilingual lexical unit and its translations in different languages are represented as connected nodes with labels. In an MPG the set of nodes N consists of p,l, s, occ, where p is the string of the preterm, l is the language, s is the code of the first source of the preterm, and occ is the number of occurrences. Note that l could be undefined. For example: N={[silk road, en, log],[Great Wall of China, en, ,wikipedia, 5], [L:���ا, ar, contributorx,6]}, here we have three n</context>
