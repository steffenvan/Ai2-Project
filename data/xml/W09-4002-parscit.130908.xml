The main goal of this paper is to investigate
the behavior of Romanian syllables related to
some classical minimum effort laws: the laws of
Chebanow, Menzerath and Fenk. The results are
compared with results of similar researches real-

<bodyText confidence="0.9998190625">
In the last decade, the building of language resources
(LR) and theirs relevance to practically all fields of In-
formation Society Technologies has been widely recog-
nized. LRs cover basic software tools for their acqui-
sition, preparation, collection, management, customi-
sation and use and are used in many types of appli-
cations (from language services to e-learning and lin-
guistic studies, etc.) The relevance of the evaluation
for language technologies development is increasingly
recognised. On the other hand, the lack of these re-
sources for a given language makes the computational
analyzes of that language almost impossible.
The lexical resources contain a lot of data base of
linguistics resources like tree banks, morphemes, dic-
tionaries, annotated corpora, etc. In the last years,
one of the linguistics structures which regained the at-
tention of the scientific community from Natural Lan-
guage Processing area was the syllable (Kaplan and
Kay 1994, Levelt and Indefrey 2001, Muller 2002, Dinu
and Dinu 2005a,b). New and exciting researches re-
garding the formal, quantitative, or cognitive aspects
of syllables arise, and new applications of syllables in
various fields are proposed: speech recognition, auto-
matical transcription of spoken language into written
language, or language acquisition are just few of them.
A rigorous study of the structure and characteris-
tics of the syllable is almost impossible without the
help provided by a complete data base of the sylla-
bles in a given language. A syllable data base has not
only a passive role of description, but an active role in
applications as speech recognition. Also, the psycho-
linguistic investigation could greatly benefit from the

existence of such a data base. These are some of the
reasons which provided our motivation for investigat-
ing the behavior of Romanian syllable related to some
cognitive laws, based on the corpus of Romanian syl-
lable extracted from DOOM.
</bodyText>

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964342105263">
The linguists refused to accord to the syllable the sta-
tus of structural unity of the language, as opposed to
the units as the phoneme and the morpheme. As a
consequence, the mathematical models of the syllable
failed to equal the complexity of the morpheme and
phoneme mathematical models.
From the point of view of the language acquisition,
the syllables are the first linguistical units learned dur-
ing the acquisition process. Numerous studies showed
that the children’s first mental representation is syl-
labic in nature, the phonetic representation occurring
only later.
Each language has its own way of grouping the
sounds into syllables, as a result of its structure. The
grouping of the syllables takes place depending on the
innate psychic inclination of the group. If the vow-
els in a word are suppressed and only the consonants
remain, the word form can be reconstructed with a
high probability, when the syllabification of the word
is known. This shows that from the existence of the
consonant one can deduce the presence of the vowel,
so one can determine the graphical form of the syl-
lable an of the whole word. These aspects may have
application in cryptography.
Numerous physiological experiments concerning the
syllable are realized between the second part of the
XIX-th century and the first part of the XX-th cen-
tury. The experiments from 1899 made by Oussoff
showed that the syllable does not always coincide with
the respiratory act, because, during a single expira-
tion, more then one syllable can be produced. In
1928 Stetson also showed that the syllable synchro-
nizes with the movement of the thoracic muscles: each
new movement of the muscles produces a new syllable
(cf. Rosetti, 1963).
The psycholinguistic elements are situated inside
the speech production area. Experiments revealed
the presence of a library of articulatory pre-compiled

routines, which is accessed during the speech produc-
tion process. In 1994 these observations leaded to the
so-called mental syllabary. The theory of Levelt and
Wheeldon (1994) assumes the existence of this men-
tal syllabary: for frequently used syllables there is a
library of articulatory routines that is accessed dur-
ing the process of speech production. The adjoining
of such syllabic gesture generates the spoken word and
greatly reduce the computational cost of articulatory
programs.
These aspects determined us to study and analyze
the syllable. In the following we will focus on the lex-
ical (not phonological) aspects of the syllable.

3 Quantitative aspects of the
syllable
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993388">
Opposite to the lack of qualitative insight regarding
the syllable, the quantitative, statistic nature of the
syllable was intensely studied.
Determining the optimal values of the length of
sentences and of the words depending on the certain
groups of readers may prove to be very useful in practi-
cal application. By optimum value we understand the
value for which the level of comprehensibility is the
biggest for the class of readers. Knowing this value
should be especially important for the teachers and
for publishers who print text books. The main con-
clusion of (Elts and Mikk, 1996) is that, for a good
understanding of a text, the length of sentences in the
text must be around the average length of sentences.
Some optimum values are presented in the next table:
The optimal length of the words (Bamberge,
Vanecek, 1984-cf. Elts and Mikk, 1996) (the first row
is the readers’ level, the second row is the length of
words in syllables, and the third row is the length of
words in letters):
Another experiment on 98 students which were given
48 texts, produced the following optimal values:
Level 8 Level 10
Optimal words (in letters) 8.53 8.67
Optimal sentences (in letters) 71.5 76.0

3.1 On the data base of Romanian syl-
lables
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991756521739131">
In order to properly investigate the cognitive aspects
of the syllables (often embedded in minimum effort
laws), it is necessary to have a data base of syllables.
In [9] a such database of Romanian syllables is pre-
sented. We list here some of the main results of this
study, with possible cognitive implications. Based on
this database, in the next section we will investigate
the behavior of Romanian syllables related to some
cognitive laws.
Based on the DOOM dictionary, which contains
Nwords = 74.276 words, the following series of quan-
titative and descriptive results for the syllables of Ro-
manian language was extracted ([9]):
1. it was identified NStype = 6496 (type syllables) in
Romanian language. The total number of sylla-
bles (token syllables) is NStoken = 273261. So,the
average length of a word measured in syllables is
Lwordssyl = NStoken/Nwords = 273261/74276 =
3,678.
2. The 74276 words are formed of Nletters = 632702
letters. So, the average length of a word mea-
sured in letters is Lwordslet = Nletters/Nwords =
632702/74276 = 8,518.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.886547142857143">
3. In order to characterize the average length of a
syllable measured in letters, two cases were inves-
tigated:
(a) the average length of the token sylla-
bles measured in letters is: Lsyltoken =
Nletters/NStoken = 632706/273261 = 2,315
(b) The type syllables are formed of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.968036275862069">
NTletters = 24406 letters. Thus, the
average length of a type syllable measured
in letters is Lsyltype = NTletters/NStype =
24406/6496 = 3,757
4. The number of consonant-vowel structures which
appear in the syllables is 56. Depending on the
type-token rapport, the most frequent consonant-
vowel structures are:
(a) for the type syllables: cvc (22%), ccvc (14%),
cvcc (10%).
(b) for the token-syllables: cv(53%), cvc (17%),
v (8%), ccv (6%), vc (4%), cvv (2%) and
cvcc (2%).
It is remarkable that these last 7 structures
(i.e. 12% of the 56 structures) cover approx-
imatively 95% of the total number of the ex-
istent syllables.
5. the most frequent 50 syllables (i.e. 0,7% of the syl-
lables number NStype) have 137662 occurrences,
i.e. 50,03% of NStoken.
6. the most frequent 200 syllables cover 76% of
NStoken, the most frequent 400 cover 85% of
NStoken and the most frequent 500 syllables (i.e.
7,7 % of NStype) cover 87% of NStoken. Over this
number, the percentage of covering rises slowly.
7. the first 1200 syllables in there frequency order
cover 95% of NStoken.
8. 2651 syllables of NStype occur only once (hapax
legomena).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.656237333333333">
9. 5060 syllables (i.e. 78%) of NStype occur less then
10 times. These syllables represent 11960 sylla-
bles (4% of NStoken).
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.992499">
10
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.96829916">
10. 158941 syllables (58% of NStoken) are formed of 2
letters; the syllables formed of 3 letters represent
27% of NStoken, those formed of 1 letter repre-
sent 9% of NStoken and those formed of 4 letters
represent 6% of NStoken.
The upper results are similar to other results, from
different languages. For Dutch (cf. Schiller et al.,
1996), the first 500 type syllables, ordered after their
frequency,(,: 5% of the total number of type syllables),
cover approximatively 85% of the total number of to-
ken syllables. For English, the result is similar, the
first 500 syllables cover approximatively 80% of the
total number of the token syllables. This results sup-
port the mental syllabary thesis.
4 The laws of Chebanow, Menz-
erath and Fenk for Romanian
syllables
Several studies proposed laws of the minimum effort
type: the famous Zipf’s law, Menzerath’s law which
states that the bigger the number of syllables in a
word, the lesser the number of phonemes compos-
ing these syllables. In cognitive economy terms, this
means that The more complex a linguistic construct,
the smaller its constituents. Fenk proposes another
three forms of this law:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96185275">
1. The bigger the length of a word, measured in
phonemes, the lesser the length of its constituent
syllables, measured in phonemes.
2. The bigger the average length of sentences, mea-
sured in syllables, the lesser the average length of
syllables, measured in phonemes.
3. There is a negative correlation between the length
of sentences, measured in words, and the length

of the words, measured in syllables.
In this section we investigate the behavior of Ro-
manian syllables related to the three above mentioned
laws.

4.1 Chebanow’s law
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981289142857143">
An intens studied problem in quantitative linguistics
was the one regarding the existence of a correlation be-
tween the words’ length (in syllables) and theirs occur-
rence’s probability. In 1947, Chebanow investigated
127 Indo-European languages and he proposed a Pois-
son type law for the above problem.
For each particular language, he used a large num-
ber of texts to obtain the frequency of words. Denot-
ing by F(n) the frequency of a word having n syllables
� nF(n)
and by i = � F(n) the average length (measured in
syllables) of the words, Chebanow proposed the fol-
lowing law between the average i and the probability
of occurences P(n) of the words having n syllables:

We checked the Chebanow’s law on the data base of
Romanian syllables and we obtained a strong similar-
ity between the Poisson’s distribution (Fig.1) and the
distribution of length (in syllables) of words (Fig. 2):
Remark 1 It is important to see that the graphic from
Fig. 2 must be translated with 1 to the left in order
to overlap with Chebanow’s law (probability P(n) of
the words of length n is the Poisson distribution with
parameter n − 1).
Remark 2 In the Fig. 1 we represented the following
Poisson’s distribution (the average length of word is
3.678, so we have to use the value 3.678-1=2.678, cf.
Chebanow’s law) :

In this paper we have presented some quantitative ob-
servations obtained from the analyze of a data base of
Romanian syllables and we checked the behavior of the
laws of Chebanow, Menzerath and Fenk for Romanian
syllables. All of our results are similar to the results of
other researches from different other natural languages
(e.g. English, Dutch, Korean, cf. Schiller et. al 199
6, Choi 2000) . In some future work we hope to be
able to present results obtained by analyzing a corpus
of spoken Romanian language other then the one we
used (DOOM) and compare them to the results in this

Elts and Mikk, 1996) (the first row is the readers’ level, the second row is the length of words in syllables, and the third row is the length of words in letters): Another experiment on 98 students which were given 48 texts, produced the following optimal values: Level 8 Level 10 Optimal words (in letters) 8.53 8.67 Optimal sentences (in letters) 71.5 76.0 3.1 On the data base of Romanian syllables In order to properly investigate the cognitive aspects of the syllables (often embedded in minimum effort laws), it is necessary to have a data base of syllables. In [9] a such database of Romanian syllables is presented. We list here some of the main results of this study, with possible cognitive implications. Based on this database, in the next section we will investigate the behavior of Romanian syllables related to some cognitive laws. Based on the DOOM dictionary, which contains Nwords = 74.276 words, the following series of quantitative and descriptive results for the syllables of Romanian language was extracted ([9]): 1. it was identified NStype = 6496 (type syllables) in Romanian language. The total number of syllables (token syllables) is NStoken = 2</context>
