which chooses a focus of attention in a discourse and moves it
around as the speaker&apos;s focus changes. The paper shows how to
use the focussing algorithm by an extended example given below.
D1-1 Alfred and Zohar liked to play baseball.

dinner.
3 After their game, the two usually went for ice
cream cones.
4 They tasted really good.
5 Alfred always had the vanilla super scooper,

In this example, the discourse focusses initially on baseball. The
focus moves in D1-3 to the ice cream cone. Using this example,
I show how the formal algorithm computes focus and determines
how the focus moves according to the signals which the speaker
uses in discourse to indicate the movement.
Given a process notion of focus, the paper reviews the
difficulties with previous approaches (Rieger [1974], Charniak
[1972], Winograd [1971], Hobbs [1975] and Lock tnan [1978]).
Briefly, the first four authors all point out the need for
inferencing as part of anaphora disambiguation, but each of
their schemes for inferencing suffer from the need for control
which will reduce the combinatorial search or which will insure
only one search path is taken. In addition, Winograd and
Lockman are aware of pronoun phenomena which cannot be
treated strictly by inference, as shown below.

In order to state formal rules for pronoun
interpretation, the concept of antecedence is defined
computationally as a relationship among elements represented in
a database. Using this framework, the paper supports two
claims by means of rules for antecedence.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9475245">
1. The focus provides a source of
antecedence in rules for interpreting
pronominal anaphora.
2. Focussing provides a control for the
inferencing necessary for some kinds of
anaphora.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995180260869565">
The rules for pronominal anaphora rely on three sources of
confirming information: syntactic criteria, semantic selectional
restrictions and consistency checks from inferencing procedures.
The use of these rules are presented for examples D2 above and
D3 below.
03-1 Whitimore isn&apos;t such a good thief.
2 The man whose watch he stole called the
police.
3 They caught him.
These examples show how to use the three sources of
information to support or reject a predicted antecedence. In
particular, inferencing is controlled by checking for consistency
on a predicted choice rather than by search ?ming general
inference.
The paper also indicates what additional requirements
are needed for a full treatment of pronominal anphora. These
include use of a representation such as that of Webber [1978];
linguistic rules such as the disjoint reference rules of Lasnik
[1976] and Reinhart [1976] as well as rules of anaphora in
logical form given by Chomsky [19761 and presence of actor
foci such as they in 03. The nature of these requirements is
discussed, while the computational inclusion of them is found in
Sid ner (1979).
