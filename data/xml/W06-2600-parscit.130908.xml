INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999557533333333">
Language processing largely deals with multidimensional and highly structured forms of
information. Indeed, from the morphological up to the deep syntactic and semantic levels,
linguistic information is often described by structured data, making the learning of the
associated linguistic tasks more complex.
Traditional methods for the design of language applications involve the extraction of
features that map data representations to vectors of attributes/values. Unfortunately, there
is no methodology that helps in this feature modeling problem. Consequently, in order to
encode structured data, the designer has to rely on his/her deep knowledge, expertise and
intuition about the linguistic phenomenon associated with the target structures.
Recently, approaches that attempt to alleviate such modeling complexity by directly
encoding structured data have been developed. Among other, kernel methods and
conditional random fields provide interesting properties. The former use kernel functions
to implicitly define richer feature spaces (e.g. substructure spaces) whereas the latter allow
the designer to directly encode the probabilistic model on the structures. The promising
aspects of such approaches open new research directions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984651333333333">
(a) the study of their impact on the modeling of diverse natural language structures,
(b) their comparative assessment with traditional attribute-value models, and
(c) the investigation of techniques which aim to improve their efficiency.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.933377902439024">
Additionally, the complementary study of mapping the classification function in structured
spaces is very interesting. Classification functions can be designed to output structured
data instead of simple values. In other words, the output values may be interpreted as
macro-labels which describe configurations and dependencies over simpler components, e.g.
parse trees or semantic structures.
The workshop was held on April 3, 2006, just preceding the 11th Conference of the
European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Its primary objective
was to favor the discussing on the above topics. For this purpose, researchers from different
communities such as machine learning, computational linguistics, information retrieval and
data mining were invited to partecipate at the workshop to promote the discussion and
development of new ideas and methods for the effective exploitation of ”structured data”
for natural language learning and applications.
Regarding these latter, Coreference Resolution, Information/Relation Extraction,
Machine Translation, Multilingual Corpus Alignment, Named Entity Recognition, Question
Classification, Semantic Role Labeling, Semantic Parsing, Syntactic Parsing and Parse Re-
Ranking, Text Categorization and Word Sense Disambiguation were considered particularly
interesting for the workshop discussion. Moreover, machine learning approaches based
on Kernel Methods, Maximal Margin Classifiers, Conditional Random Fields and Support
Vector Machines (SVMs) were judged those most promising to deal with structured data.
This volume contains twelve papers accepted for presentation at the workshop. We
received a rather large number of high quality papers. Consequently, due to the restriction
imposed by one day workshop, we decided to divide the papers in two categories: those
reporting almost conclusive results and/or theories supported by a sound experimentation
(full papers) and those proposing preliminary results and/or theories that would have been
received significant benefits from a more extensive experimentation (position papers).
ii
The program committee accepted eight submissions as full papers (about 50% of
acceptance rate) and others four as position papers. The workshop papers deal with
several interesting aspects of structured data in natural language learning. From a machine
learning perspective, the contributions on: kernel methods within SVMs, probabilistic
approaches and unsupervised methods, e.g. latent semantic analysis, support an interesting
comparative discussion. Regarding the NLP tasks, the papers touch almost all the targeted
applications: Named Entity recognition, Relation Extraction, Discourse Parsing, Semantic
Role Labeling, Prepositional Phrase Attachment problem, Text Categorization, Machine
Translation and Question Answering.
We believe that the workshop outcome will be helpful to increase the knowledge about
advanced machine learning techniques in the modeling of structured data for Natural
Language Applications.
We gratefully acknowledge all the members of the Program Committee for the excellent
work done in reviewing and commenting the individual submissions within the very short
time.
