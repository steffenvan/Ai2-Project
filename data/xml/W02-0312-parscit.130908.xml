3.2 Shallow Parsing Module
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99973445">
The construction of shallow parse trees involves
a cascade of five separate automata, each focus-
ing on a distinct family of grammatical construc-
tions. This is very much in the spirit of Hindle
(1983), McDonald (1992) and Pustejovsky et al.
(1997). These can be distinguished as follows:
Level I: Noun chunking groups proper nouns
and common nouns. It also groups some double
prepositions, and compound relational terms.
Level II: Creates noun phrase chunks without
prepositional phrases (including adjectives and
determiners). It also creates relational terms
chunks (verbal chunks, including some adjecti-
val and adverbial terms).
Level III: Creates chunks for coordinated
nouns or noun chunks, and coordinated verbal
chunks or verbs.
Level IV: Creates chunks of noun phrases with
of-prepositional phrase.
Level V: Identifies subordinate clauses chunks.

3.3 Semantic Type Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903949152543">
The role of semantic typing is to accurately de-
termine the conceptual categories of the words
and phrases encountered in Medline abstracts.
Aside from direct applications, such as query
reformulation or filtering of results according to
type restrictions, the accurate assignment of se-
mantic types to entities and predicates facili-
tates the tasks of anaphora resolution and re-
lation extraction. The set of categories used
in semantic typing needs to be adequate for
these tasks, as applied to the biomedical do-
main. There are a number of efforts under way
to develop specialized taxonomies and knowl-
edge bases for the biomedical domain (UMLS,
Gene Ontology, SWISS-PROT, OMIM, DIP).
Wide coverage taxonomies combining a number
of sources, such as UMLS, seem particularly fit-
ting for the semantic typing task, especially if
they can be enriched with more focused special-
ized knowledge bases. Our initial system for se-
mantic typing relies on the UMLS semantic type
system.
Medline abstracts are shallow-parsed, with
limited prepositional attachment (only of-
attachment) using finite-state techniques. Se-
mantic typing of the resulting noun chunks
is performed using a combination of lookup
and morphology-based heuristics. The lookup
is performed from UMLS. Each noun phrase
is put through a cascade of hierarchically ar-
ranged type-assignment heuristics. Higher pri-
ority heuristics take absolute precedence, that
is, if a semantic typing is possible, it is assigned.
During direct lookup, a string is assigned a
given semantic type if the UMLS Metathesaurus
contains a mapping of that string to one con-
cepts so typed. If a semantic type for the whole
phrase is not found in UMLS, we attempt to
identify the syntactic head of the phrase us-
ing a modification of the right hand head rule
(cf. (Pustejovsky et al., 1997)), and determine
its type. For chunks with of-attachment, i.e.,
phrases of the form, [&lt;NP-1&gt; of &lt;NP-2&gt;], the
lookup is also attempted on NP-1 as a whole. If
lookup on the given prospective head fails, it is
tested for match with morphological heuristics,
using a limited number of suffixes.
Direct semantic typing using the above ap-
proach confirms the need to adapt and extend
the UMLS semantic type system. In particular,
in must be enriched with string-to-type map-
pings from other sources, using more specific
typing (e.g. &apos;protein&apos;, rather than &apos;Amino Acid,
Peptid, or Protein). This has motivated the de-
velopment of semantic re-rendering algorithms,
designed to enrich the ontological specificity of
a domain-specific semantic tag set, based on in-
ductive techniques described in (Pustejovsky et
al., 2002c).

3.4 Rerendering Semantic Ontologies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999502380952381">
The UMLS, like many industry-standard tax-
onomies, contains a large number of word-
concept pairings (&gt;500K typed terms), making
it potentially attractive as a resource for seman-
tic tagging information. However, the overall
type structure of UMLS is very shallow. For ex-
ample, for the semantic tag &amp;quot;Amino Acid, Pep-
tide, or Protein&amp;quot; (AAPP), there are 180,998 en-
tries, for which there are dozens of functional
subtypes that are distinguished by biologists,
but not in the UMLS.
One specific example of the type system
deficiencies illustrates this point very clearly:
the extraction of relations and their arguments
from text is greatly improved with entity and
anaphora resolution capabilities. However, en-
tity and event anaphora resolution rely on
(among other things) the semantic typing of the
anaphor and its potential antecedents, particu-
larly with sortal and event anaphora, as shown
in (1) below.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90081575">
(1) a. [p21, inhibits the regulation of
[This inhibitor, binds to ...]
b. [A phosphorylates, B.] ...
phosphorylation, of B ...]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999010327272727">
Strict UMLS typing presents a problem for
anaphora resolution algorithm. For example,
(1a) shows a known protein (p21) being subse-
quently referred to as an &apos;inhibitor&apos; (a functional
of such class of proteins). This type does not ex-
ist in UMLS and the noun &apos;inhibitor&apos; is merely
typed as an AAPP. It is therefore difficult to
discriminate p21 from other proteins (as poten-
tial antecedents) for the sortal anaphor &amp;quot;this in-
hibitor&amp;quot;. A related difficulty is encountered with
event anaphora cases such as (lb), where an
event nominal anaphor binds to a tensed event
as its antecedent, both of which are of differ-
ent types in UMLS. Hence, the existing UMLS
system does not allow for recognition of type-
subtype relations of the kinds that are needed
in order to identify anaphoric bindings in Med-
line texts.
Given these motivations, we are developing a
set of techniques for &amp;quot;rerendering&amp;quot; an existing
semantic ontology to satisfy the requirements
of specific features of a (set of) application(s).
For the present case (i.e., the UMLS and bio-
entity and relation extraction), we will iden-
tify candidate subtypes for inclusion in the type
system by two means: (a) corpus analysis on
compound nominal phrases that express unique
functional behavior of the compound head; (b)
identification of functionally defined subtypes
derived from bio-relation parsing and extraction
from the corpus. The results of rerendering will
be evaluated for correctness against the original
type system, and against additional taxonomies,
should they exist, such as the GO ontology.
Our system uses one of two resources for dy-
namic semantic typing of the input: (a) the
UMLS Thesaurus can be exploited to assign
types to nouns or noun phrases according to
the UMLS type ontology; (b) the GO ontology
is also available as a type resource for specific
genomic data. The UMLS types were however
used in the anaphora resolution task, as one
of the parameters in ranking the possible an-
tecedents list.
The relation identification module was built in-
dependent of the specifics of any verb and associ-
ated nominals in Medline. Rather, this module
was defined and designed to work on the out-
put of the shallow parsing module to identify
argument and relational chunks, independently
of any specific lexical item. The extraction of
a particular relation (e.g. inhibit or regulate),
is accomplished by specifying stems that de-
note the required relation. Sentence-level pars-
ing identifies the following constructions:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996825">
In the nominal domain, head nouns may typi-
cally carry relational semantics; for example the
noun inhibitor can refer to both the relation as
well as the biological entity itself. The parsing
decisions involved for these forms are distinct
from the verbal form. The constructions and
relations identified by the nominal-level module
are given below:

Note that relations inside Level IV are decom-
posed first, i.e., of-prepositional relations. Our
next step will be to add reduced relative clauses
and gerundive relations to this parser module.
As mentioned briefly above, the initial cor-
pus analysis distinguished the verbal forms from
the nominal forms. Because of their distinct
argument binding and complementation behav-
iors, we decided to develop separate automata
for each form, and then merge the results in a
subsequent database population phase. In fact,
however, there is reason to believe that keep-
ing the results extracted from the two modules
separate is actually desirable for database pur-
poses as well; this is due in large part to the
degree of relevance associated with &apos;given&apos; ver-
sus &apos;new&apos; information as presented in documents
(cf. (Pustejovsky et al., in preparation)).

5.1 Acronym Sense Disambiguation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9887122">
Acronyms are widely used in biomedical and
other technical texts. Understanding their
meaning constitutes an important problem in
the automatic extraction and mining of informa-
tion from text. Moreover, an even harder prob-
lem is sense disambiguation of acronyms; that
is, where a single acronym has a multiplicity of
meanings (polynyms), a common occurrence in
the biomedical literature. In such cases, it is
necessary to identify the correct corresponding
sense for the polynym, which is often not di-
rectly specified in the text. For example, the
acronym AC appeared associated to the follow-
ing different long forms in a search through dif-
ferent documents:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.9158635">

<bodyText confidence="0.999978961538462">
Here we present a system called AcroMed
which finds acronym-meaning pairs as part of a
set of information extraction tools designed for
processing and extracting data from abstracts
in the Medline database. Our strategy for find-
ing acronym-meaning pairs differs from previ-
ous automated acronym extraction methods by
incorporating shallow parsing of the text into
the acronym recognition algorithm. The per-
formance of our system has been tested with a
highly diverse set of Medline texts, giving 98 %
precision. We then present an initial approach
for disambiguating polynyms, using a vector
space model. Our disambiguation tests pro-
duced 97.62 % accuracy in one test for acronyms
and 86.6 % accuracy in another for aliases.
A second task here is that of grouping to-
gether equivalent long forms which constitute a
single sense of a given acronym. To that end we
have used two formal criteria. Two long forms
are considered to mean the same when they have
a common normalized form (the corresponding
version of a long form in lower case and not con-
taining either hyphens or a plural &apos;s&apos;) or when
an 80% of the longest form is also present in the
shortest one. Some examples of grouping are:

<bodyText confidence="0.999661333333333">
Currently we are also working on the identi-
fication and correlation of acronym aliases (i.e.,
different terms that refer to the same entity, or
synonyms). Our final aim is to be able to point
to a concept from different aliases and know
what other denominations the concept receives.

5.2 Coherence and Anaphora
Resolution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799568627451">
Identifying the arguments of the relations may
not be enough for identifying the actual entities
involved in the relation. Quite often anaphors
(e.g., it, they) and sortal anaphoric noun phrases
(e.g. the protein, both enzymes) are the actual
arguments to a relation, but unfortunately are
not specific enough to establish a unique ref-
erence to an entity or process. Although the
use of anaphoric terms seems to be relatively
infrequent in Medline abstracts, the use of sor-
tal anaphors is quite prevalent. This module
focuses on the resolution of biologically rele-
vant sortal terms (i.e., proteins, genes, and bio-
processes), as well as pronominal anaphors, in-
cluding third person pronouns and reflexive pro-
nouns. The initial data source for this resolu-
tion algorithm is the preprocessed Medline text
(shallow parsed), where each noun phrase (NP)
has been identified and annotated with a syn-
tactic tag and semantic tag(s). The anaphora
resolution algorithm examines the text sequen-
tially and represents each sentence as a &amp;quot;frame
environment&amp;quot;. Every NP within a sentence is
a potential referent and is made into an entity
with a unique ID and syntactic/semantic tags,
and added to the sentence environment in which
it occurs. If an NP is identified as an anaphor,
then the resolution algorithm will attempt to re-
solve it by traversing through the sentence envi-
ronments from the most recent (which contains
the anaphor), back to the first sentence of the
abstract, and selecting the NP among the sen-
tences that has the highest compatibility with
the anaphor as the antecedent (cf. Kennedy and
Boguraev (1996)). The choice of antecedent is
determined by matching syntactic and semantic
features of the candidate NP with that of the
anaphor, which includes person/number agree-
ment, semantic type, as well as physical string
comparisons. In the case that more than one
NP is found to be equally compatible, prefer-
ence is given to the one that is most adjacent to
the anaphor in the text. If an anaphor requires
multiple antecedents (e.g., the anaphor both en-
zymes) then the resolution algorithm will con-
tinue in the sentence environment where the first
antecedent is found, and then select the subse-
quent antecedent which is most compatible with
both the anaphor and the first antecedent.
Here we are concerned with 2 types of
anaphors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9949908">
• Pronominal Anaphors: including third per-
son pronouns and reflexive pronouns. E.g.,
Human growth hormone ( hGH ) binds to
its receptor ( hGHr ) in a three-body inter-
action: one molecule of it and two identical
monomers of the receptor form a trimer.
• Sortal Anaphors as Epithets. E.g., we
quantitatively analyzed the relationship be-
tween the structure and inhibiting ac-
tivity of these substances toward acetyl-
cholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase.
Hydrophobic interactions were found to be
important for the inhibition of both en-
zymes but are more pronounced in the case
of butyryl cholinesterase.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99947175">
From our analysis of the Medline corpus, we
found that the use of both types of anaphors,
especially sortal anaphors, is quite prevalent in
Medline abstracts. For instance, out of 100
distinct anaphors derived from a set of 60-70
Medline documents, approximately 60% are sor-
tal anaphors. Our initial tests (Castafio et al.,
2002) resulted in 77% precision and 71% recall.

are the arguments of the relation. As a result of
the search, all biological relations relevant to the

The tagged elements were then stemmed with a version of the Porter stemmer The incorresponding to the syntactic tag, and the corresponding stem is stored a A simple morphological analysis is performed to identify derived words that are not in the lexical databases for subsequent database inclusion. 3.2 Shallow Parsing Module The construction of shallow parse trees involves a cascade of five separate automata, each focusing on a distinct family of grammatical constructions. This is very much in the spirit of Hindle (1983), McDonald (1992) and Pustejovsky et al. (1997). These can be distinguished as follows: I: chunking groups proper nouns and common nouns. It also groups some double prepositions, and compound relational terms. II: noun phrase chunks without prepositional phrases (including adjectives and determiners). It also creates relational terms chunks (verbal chunks, including some adjectival and adverbial terms). III: chunks for coordinated nouns or noun chunks, and coordinated verbal chunks or verbs. IV: chunks of noun phrases with of-prepositional phrase. V: subordinate clauses chunks. 3.3 Semantic Type Identification The role of semantic typing is to accurately determine the conceptual categories of the words and phrases encountered in Medline abstracts. Aside from direct applications, such as query reformulation or filtering of results according to type restrictions, the accurate assignment of semantic types to entities and predicates facilitates the tasks of anaphora resolution and relation extraction. The set of categories used in semantic typing needs to be adequate for these tasks, as applied to the biomedical domain. There are a number of efforts under way to develop specialized taxonomies and knowledge bases for the biomedical domain (UMLS, Gene Ontology, SWISS-PROT, OMIM, DIP). Wide coverage taxonomies combining a number of sources, such as UMLS, seem particularly fitting for the semantic typing task, especially if they can be enriched with more focused specialized knowledge bases. Our initial system for semantic typing relies on the UMLS semantic type system. Medline abstracts are shallow-parsed, with prepositional attachment (only ofattachment) using finite-state techniques. Semantic typing of the resulting noun chunks is performed using a combination of lookup and morphology-based heuristics. The lookup is performed from UMLS. Each noun phrase is put through a cascade of hierarchically arranged type-assignment heuristics. Higher priority heuristics take absolute precedence, that is, if a semantic typing is possible, it is assigned. During direct lookup, a string is assigned a given semantic type if the UMLS Metathesaurus contains a mapping of that string to one concepts so typed. If a semantic type for the whole phrase is not found in UMLS, we attempt to identify the syntactic head of the phrase usa modification of the hand head rule (cf. (Pustejovsky et al., 1997)), and determine its type. For chunks with of-attachment, i.e., of the form, of lookup is also attempted on NP-1 as a whole. If lookup on the given prospective head fails, it is tested for match with morphological heuristics, using a limited number of suffixes. Direct semantic typing using the above approach confirms the need to adapt and extend the UMLS semantic type system. In particular, in must be enriched with string-to-type mappings from other sources, using more specific typing (e.g. &apos;protein&apos;, rather than &apos;Amino Acid, Peptid, or Protein). This has motivated the deof re-rendering designed to enrich the ontological specificity of a domain-specific semantic tag set, based on inductive techniques described in (Pustejovsky et al., 2002c). 3.4 Rerendering Semantic Ontologies The UMLS, like many industry-standard taxonomies, contains a large number of wordconcept pairings (&gt;500K typed terms), making it potentially attractive as a resource for semantic tagging information. However, the overall type structure of UMLS is very shallow. For example, for the semantic tag &amp;quot;Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein&amp;quot; (AAPP), there are 180,998 entries, for which there are dozens of functional subtypes that are distinguished by biologists, but not in the UMLS. One specific example of the type system deficiencies illustrates this point very clearly: the extraction of relations and their arguments from text is greatly improved with entity and anaphora resolution capabilities. However, entity and event anaphora resolution rely on (among other things) the semantic typing of the anaphor and its potential antecedents, particularly with sortal and event anaphora, as shown in (1) below. (1) a. [p21, inhibits the regulation of [This inhibitor, binds to ...] b. [A phosphorylates, B.] phosphorylation, of B ...] Strict UMLS typing presents a problem for anaphora resolution algorithm. For example, (1a) shows a known protein (p21) being subsequently referred to as an &apos;inhibitor&apos; (a functional of such class of proteins). This type does not exist in UMLS and the noun &apos;inhibitor&apos; is merely typed as an AAPP. It is therefore difficult to discriminate p21 from other proteins (as potential antecedents) for the sortal anaphor &amp;quot;this inhibitor&amp;quot;. A related difficulty is encountered with event anaphora cases such as (lb), where an event nominal anaphor binds to a tensed event as its antecedent, both of which are of different types in UMLS. Hence, the existing UMLS system does not allow for recognition of typesubtype relations of the kinds that are needed in order to identify anaphoric bindings in Medline texts. Given these motivations, we are developing a set of techniques for &amp;quot;rerendering&amp;quot; an existing semantic ontology to satisfy the requirements of specific features of a (set of) application(s). For the present case (i.e., the UMLS and bioentity and relation extraction), we will identify candidate subtypes for inclusion in the type system by two means: (a) corpus analysis on compound nominal phrases that express unique functional behavior of the compound head; (b) identification of functionally defined subtypes derived from bio-relation parsing and extraction from the corpus. The results of rerendering will be evaluated for correctness against the original type system, and against additional taxonomies, should they exist, such as the GO ontology. Our system uses one of two resources for dynamic semantic typing of the input: (a) the UMLS Thesaurus can be exploited to assign types to nouns or noun phrases according to the UMLS type ontology; (b) the GO ontology is also available as a type resource for specific genomic data. The UMLS types were however used in the anaphora resolution task, as one of the parameters in ranking the possible antecedents list. The relation identification module was built independent of the specifics of any verb and associated nominals in Medline. Rather, this module was defined and designed to work on the output of the shallow parsing module to identify argument and relational chunks, independently of any specific lexical item. The extraction of particular relation (e.g. is accomplished by specifying stems that denote the required relation. Sentence-level parsing identifies the following constructions: SENTENCE-LEVEL RELATION IDENTIFICATION (1) Main predicate relational chunk in the sentence. (2) Subject nominal chunk (nominal chunks at 4th level above). (3) Object nominal chunks. (4) Subordinate clauses (identifying also antecedents of relative clauses, and main predicates of object clauses). [The 4 Relation Identification (5) Sentential coordination. It has also the capability of identifying: (6) Preverbal adjuncts. (7) Post Object target adjuncts (ambiguous between adjuncts and nominal modifiers, PP attachment ambiguity). In the nominal domain, head nouns may typically carry relational semantics; for example the refer to both the relation as well as the biological entity itself. The parsing decisions involved for these forms are distinct from the verbal form. The constructions and relations identified by the nominal-level module are given below: NOMINAL-LEVEL RELATION IDENTIFICATION (1) Nominal chunks of Level IV. (2) Prepositional relational chunks. Note that relations inside Level IV are decomposed first, i.e., of-prepositional relations. Our next step will be to add reduced relative clauses and gerundive relations to this parser module. As mentioned briefly above, the initial corpus analysis distinguished the verbal forms from the nominal forms. Because of their distinct argument binding and complementation behaviors, we decided to develop separate automata for each form, and then merge the results in a subsequent database population phase. In fact, however, there is reason to believe that keeping the results extracted from the two modules separate is actually desirable for database purposes as well; this is due in large part to the degree of relevance associated with &apos;given&apos; versus &apos;new&apos; information as presented in documents (cf. (Pustejovsky et al., in preparation)). 5 Entity Recognition 5.1 Acronym Sense Disambiguation Acronyms are widely used in biomedical and other technical texts. Understanding meaning constitutes an important problem in the automatic extraction and mining of information from text. Moreover, an even harder problem is sense disambiguation of acronyms; that is, where a single acronym has a multiplicity of meanings (polynyms), a common occurrence in the biomedical literature. In such cases, it is necessary to identify the correct corresponding sense for the polynym, which is often not directly specified in the text. For example, the acronym AC appeared associated to the following different long forms in a search through different documents: atrioventricular connection anterior colporrhaphy procedure auditory cortex atypical carcinoid abdominal circumference acalculous cholecystitis adenylyl cyclase adenyl cyclase Adenylyl cyclase adenylate cyclase Here we present a system called AcroMed which finds acronym-meaning pairs as part of a set of information extraction tools designed for processing and extracting data from abstracts in the Medline database. Our strategy for finding acronym-meaning pairs differs from previous automated acronym extraction methods by incorporating shallow parsing of the text into the acronym recognition algorithm. The performance of our system has been tested with a highly diverse set of Medline texts, giving 98 % precision. We then present an initial approach for disambiguating polynyms, using a vector space model. Our disambiguation tests produced 97.62 % accuracy in one test for acronyms and 86.6 % accuracy in another for aliases. A second task here is that of grouping together equivalent long forms which constitute a single sense of a given acronym. To that end we have used two formal criteria. Two long forms are considered to mean the same when they have a common normalized form (the corresponding version of a long form in lower case and not containing either hyphens or a plural &apos;s&apos;) or when an 80% of the longest form is also present in the shortest one. Some examples of grouping are: of the &amp;taus arteriosus patency of &amp;taus arteriosus patent &amp;taus arteriosus Adenylyl cyclase adenyl cyclase adenylate cyclase Currently we are also working on the identification and correlation of acronym aliases (i.e., different terms that refer to the same entity, or synonyms). Our final aim is to be able to point to a concept from different aliases and know what other denominations the concept receives. 5.2 Coherence and Anaphora Resolution Identifying the arguments of the relations may not be enough for identifying the actual entities involved in the relation. Quite often anaphors they) sortal anaphoric noun phrases protein, both enzymes) the actual arguments to a relation, but unfortunately are not specific enough to establish a unique reference to an entity or process. Although the use of anaphoric terms seems to be relatively infrequent in Medline abstracts, the use of sortal anaphors is quite prevalent. This module focuses on the resolution of biologically relevant sortal terms (i.e., proteins, genes, and bioprocesses), as well as pronominal anaphors, including third person pronouns and reflexive pronouns. The initial data source for this resolution algorithm is the preprocessed Medline text (shallow parsed), where each noun phrase (NP) has been identified and annotated with a syntactic tag and semantic tag(s). The anaphora resolution algorithm examines the text sequentially and represents each sentence as a &amp;quot;frame environment&amp;quot;. Every NP within a sentence is a potential referent and is made into an entity with a unique ID and syntactic/semantic tags, and added to the sentence environment in which it occurs. If an NP is identified as an anaphor, then the resolution algorithm will attempt to resolve it by traversing through the sentence environments from the most recent (which contains the anaphor), back to the first sentence of the abstract, and selecting the NP among the sentences that has the highest compatibility with the anaphor as the antecedent (cf. Kennedy and Boguraev (1996)). The choice of antecedent is determined by matching syntactic and semantic features of the candidate NP with that of the anaphor, which includes person/number agreement, semantic type, as well as physical string comparisons. In the case that more than one NP is found to be equally compatible, preference is given to the one that is most adjacent to the anaphor in the text. If an anaphor requires antecedents (e.g., the anaphor enthe resolution algorithm will continue in the sentence environment where the first antecedent is found, and then select the subsequent antecedent which is most compatible with both the anaphor and the first antecedent. Here we are concerned with 2 types of anaphors: • Pronominal Anaphors: including third person pronouns and reflexive pronouns. E.g., Human growth hormone ( hGH ) binds to its receptor ( hGHr ) in a three-body interone molecule of two identical monomers of the receptor form a trimer. Sortal Anaphors as Epithets. E.g., quantitatively analyzed the relationship between the structure and inhibiting activity of these substances toward acetylcholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase. Hydrophobic interactions were found to be for the inhibition of enare more pronounced in the case of butyryl cholinesterase. From our analysis of the Medline corpus, we found that the use of both types of anaphors, especially sortal anaphors, is quite prevalent in Medline abstracts. For instance, out of 100 distinct anaphors derived from a set of 60-70 Medline documents, approximately 60% are sortal anaphors. Our initial tests (Castafio et al., resulted in and 71% recall. 6 Information Servers BioRelation We have populated a bio-relational database using a a robust parser for identifying and extracting biomolecular relations from the biomedliterature (Medline) (e.g., inhibits B, X We have measured the system at a performance of 90% precision, 59% recall, and 22% partial recall, results which were published previously (Pustejovsky et al., 2002a). The Bio-Relation server provides the ability to search the Medstract relational database, which contains various regulatory and inhibitory relations of bio-entities (proteins, cellular processes, etc.) extracted from six months of Medline data (250,000 abstracts). The user can select the type relation to be searched regulate, as well as the UMLS type (e.g. acid) name of the bio-entities which are the arguments of the relation. As a result of the search, all biological relations relevant to the specified bio-entities are returned in either the form of a database table or a navigable hyperbolic graph. Both forms link directly to the citations from the abstracts.

In this paper we have described an approach to architecting domain specific information servers, where the target Data Bases are constructed in incremental and independent layers. This is a methodology that we would like to promote generally within the CL community. From an engineering perspective this approach embodies elements of best practices, where the end-user interacts in the development cycle providing feedback and enabling the community to supply the Quality Analysis (QA). We find this is a promising perspective on the deployment of large NL systems.</abstract>

Each noun phrase is put through a cascade of hierarchically arranged type-assignment heuristics. Higher priority heuristics take absolute precedence, that is, if a semantic typing is possible, it is assigned. During direct lookup, a string is assigned a given semantic type if the UMLS Metathesaurus contains a mapping of that string to one concepts so typed. If a semantic type for the whole phrase is not found in UMLS, we attempt to identify the syntactic head of the phrase using a modification of the right hand head rule (cf. (Pustejovsky et al., 1997)), and determine its type. For chunks with of-attachment, i.e., phrases of the form, [&lt;NP-1&gt; of &lt;NP-2&gt;], the lookup is also attempted on NP-1 as a whole. If lookup on the given prospective head fails, it is tested for match with morphological heuristics, using a limited number of suffixes. Direct semantic typing using the above approach confirms the need to adapt and extend the UMLS semantic type system. In particular, in must be enriched with string-to-type mappings from other sources, using more specific typing (e.g. &apos;protein&apos;, rather than &apos;Amino Acid, Peptid, or Protein).
