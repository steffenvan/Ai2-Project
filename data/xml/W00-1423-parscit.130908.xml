We describe the generation of communicative ac-
tions in an implemented embodied conversational
agent. Our agent plans each utterance so that mul-
tiple communicative goals may be realized oppor-
tunistically by a composite action including not only
speech but also coverbal gesture that fits the con-
text and the ongoing speech in ways representative
of natural human conversation. We accomplish this
by reasoning from a grammar which describes ges-
ture declaratively in terms of its discourse function,

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.996423375">
When we are face-to-face with another human, no
matter what our language, cultural background, or
age, we virtually all use our faces and hands as an in-
tegral part of our dialogue with others. Research on
embodied conversational agents aims to imbue in-
teractive dialogue systems with the same nonverbal
skills and behaviors (Cassell, 2000a).
There is good reason to think that nonverbal be-
havior will play an important role in evoking from
users the kinds of communicative dialogue behav-
iors they use with other humans, and thus allow
them to use the computer with the same kind of ef-
ficiency and smoothness that characterizes their di-
alogues with other people. For example, (Cassell
and Thorisson, 1999) show that humans are more
likely to consider computers lifelike, and to rate their
language skills more highly, when those computers
display not only speech but appropriate nonverbal
communicative behavior_ This argument takes on
particular importance given that users repeat them-
selves needlessly, mistake when it is their turn to
speak, and so forth when interacting with voice di-
alogue systems (Oviatt, 1995): In life, noisy situa-
tions like these provoke the non-verbal modalities to
come into play (Rogers, 1978).
In this paper, we describe the generation of com-
municative actions in an implemented embodied
conversational agent. Our generation framework
adopts a goal-directed view of generation and casts
knowledge about communicative action in the form
of a grammar that specifies how forms combine,
what interpretive effects they impart and in what
contexts they are appropriate (Appelt, 1985; Moore,
1994; Dale, 1992; Stone and Doran, 1997). We ex-
pand this framework to take into account findings,
by ourselves and others, on the relationship between
spontaneous coverbal hand gestures and speech. In
particular, our agent plans each utterance so that
multiple communicative goals may be realized op-
portunistically by a composite action including not
only speech but also coverbal gesture. By describing
gesture declaratively in terms of its discourse func-
tion, semantics and synchrony with speech, we en-
sure that coverbal gesture fits the context and the on-
going speech in ways representative of natural hu-
man conversation. The result is a streamlined imple-
mentation that instantiates important theoretical in-
sights into the relationship between speech and ges-
ture in human-human conversation.
2 Exploring the relationship between
-speech and gesture
To generate embodied communicative action re-
quires an architecture for embodied conversation;
ours is provided by the agent REA (&amp;quot;Real Estate
Agent&amp;quot;), a computer-generated humanoid that has
an articulated graphical body, can sense the user
passively through cameras and audio input, and
supports communicative actions realized in speech
with intonation, facial display, and animated ges-
ture. REA currently offers the reasoning and dis-
play capabilities to act as a real estate agent showing

menting models of the relationship between speech
and spontaneous hand gestures during conversation.
For more details about the functionality of REA see
(Cassell, 2000a).
Evidence from many sources suggests that this re-
lationship is a close one. About three-quarters of all
clauses in narrative discourse are accompanied by
gestures of one kind or another (McNeill, 1992), and
within those clauses, the most effortful part of ges-
tures tends to co-occur with or just before the phono-
logically most prominent syllable of the accompany-
ing speech (Kendon, 1974).
Of course, communication is still possible with-
out gesture. But it has been shown that when speech
is ambiguous (Thompson and Massaro, 1986) or in
a speech situation with some noise (Rogers, 1978),
listeners do rely on gestural cues (and, the higher the
noise-to-signal ratio, the more facilitation by ges-
ture). Similarly, Cassell et al. (1999) established that
listeners rely on information conveyed only in ges-
ture as they try to comprehend a story.
Most interesting in terms of building interactive
dialogue systems is the semantic and pragmatic rela-
tionship between gesture and speech. The two chan-
nels do not always manifest the same information,
but what they convey is virtually always compati-
ble. Semantically, speech and gesture give a con-
sistent view of an overall situation. For example,
gesture may depict the way in which an action was
carried out when this aspect of meaning is not de-
picted in speech. Pragmatically, speech and ges-
ture mark information about this meaning as advanc-
ing the purposes of the conversation in a consistent
way. Indeed, gesture often emphasizes information
that is also focused pragmatically by mechanisms
like prosody in speech (Cassell, 2000b). The seman-
tic and pragmatic compatibility seen in the gesture-
speech relationship recalls the interaction of words
and graphics in multimodal presentations (Feiner
and McKeown, 1991; Green et al., 1998; Wahlster
et al., 1991). In fact, some suggest (McNeill, 1992),
that gesture and speech arise together from an under-
lying representation that has both visual and linguis-
tic aspects, and so the relationship between gesture
and speech is essential to the production of meaning
and to its comprehension.
This theoretical perspective on speech and gesture
involves two key claims with computational import:
that gesture and speech .reflect-a- common concep-
tual source; and that the content and form of a ges-
ture is tuned to the communicative context and the
actor&apos;s communicative intentions. We believe that
these characteristics of the use of gesture are uni-
versal, and see the key contribution of this work as
providing a general framework for building dialogue
systems in accord with them. However, a concrete
implementation requires more than just generalities
behind its operation; we&apos;also need an understanding
of the precise ways gesture and speech are used to-
gether in a particular task and setting.
To this end, we collected a sample of real-estate
descriptions in line with what REA might be asked
to provide. To elicit each description, we asked one
subject to study a video and floor plan of a partic-
ular house, and then to describe the house to a sec-
ond subject (who did not know the house and had not
seen the video). During the conversation, the video
and floor plan were not available to either subject;
the listener was free to interrupt and ask questions.
The collected conversations were transcribed,
yielding 328 utterances and 134 referential gestures,
and coded to describe the general communicative
goals of the speaker and the kinds of semantic fea-
tures realized in speech and gesture.
Analysis of the data revealed that for roughly
50% of the gesture-accompanied utterances, gestu-
ral content was redundant with speech; for the other
50% gesture contributed content that was different,
but complementary, to that contributed by speech.
In addition, the relationship between content of ges-
ture, content of speech and general communicative
functions in house descriptions could be captured by
a small number or rules; these rules are informed by
and accord with our two key claims about speech
and gesture. For example, one rule describes di-
alogue contributions whose general function was
what we call presentation, to advance the descrip-
tion of the house by introducing a single new ob-
ject.. These contributions tended to be made up of
a sentence that asserted the existence of an object
of some type, accompanied by a non-redundant ges-
ture that elaborated theâ€¢shape or location of the ob-
ject. Our approach casts this extended description of
a new entity, mediated by two compatible modali-
ties, as the speaker&apos;s expression of one overall func-
tion of presentation.

the state of the dialogue, and to regulate the over-
all process of conversation (interactional function)?
Within this focus, REA&apos;s talk is firmly delimited.
REA&apos;s utterances take a question-answer format, in
which the user asks about (and REA describes) a
single house .at _a time. REA&apos;s .sentences are short;
generally, they contribute just a few new semantic
features about particular rooms or features of the
house (in. speech and gesture), and flesh this contri-
bution out with a handful of meaningful elements (in
speech and gesture) that ground the contribution in
shared context of the conversation.
Despite the apparent simplicity, the dialogue
manager must contribute a wealth of information
about the domain and the conversation to represent
the communicative context. This detail is needed for
REA to achieve a theoretically-motivated realization
of the common patterns of speech and gesture we ob-
served in human conversation. For example, a vari-
ety of changing features determine whether marked
forms in speech and gesture are appropriate in the
context. REA&apos;s dialogue manager tracks the chang-
ing status of such features as:
O Attentional prominence, represented (as usual
in natural language generation) by setting up a
context set for each entity (Dale, 1992). Our
model of prominence is a simple local one sim-
ilar to (Strube, 1998).
â–ª Cognitive status, including whether an entity is
hearer-old or hearer-new (Prince, 1992), and
whether an entity is in-focus or not (Gundel
et al., 1993). We can assume that houses and
their rooms are hearer-new until REA describes
them; and that just those entities mentioned in
the prior sentence are in-focus.
a Information structure, including the open
propositions or, following (Steedman, 1991),
themes, which describe the salient questions
currently at issue in the discourse (Prince,
1986). In REA&apos;s dialogue, open questions are
always general questions about some entity
raised by a recent turn; although in principle
such an open question ought to be formalized
as theme(A.P.Pe), REA can use the simpler
therne(e).
In fact, both speech and gesture depend on the same
kinds of featurestand.acces-s-them in the&apos; same way;-
this specification of the dialogue state crosscuts dis-
tinctions of communicative modality.

transcriptions (recall) and apply with an accuracy of
96% (precision). These patterns provide a concrete
specification for the main communicative strategies
and communicative resources required for REA. A
full discussion of the experimental methods and
analysis, and the resulting rules, can be found in
(Yan, 2000).
3 Framing the generation problem
In REA, requests for the generation of speech and
gesture are formulated within the dialogue manage-
ment module. REA&apos;s utterances reflect a coordina-
tion of multiple kinds of processing in the dialogue
managerâ€”the system recognizes that it has the floor,
derives the appropriate communicative context for
a response and an appropriate set of communicative
goals, triggers the generation process, and realizes
the resulting speech and gesture. The dialogue man-
ager is only one component in a multithreaded ar-
chitecture that carries out hardwired reactions to in-
put as well as deliberative processing. The diver-
sity is required in order to exhibit appropriate inter-
actional and propositional conversational behaviors
at a range of time scales, from tracking the user&apos;s
movements with gaze and providing nods and other
feedback as the user speaks, to participating in rou-
tine exchanges and generating principled responses
to user&apos;s queries. See (Cassell, 2000a) for descrip-
tion and motivation of the architecture, as well as the
conversational functions and behaviors it supports.
REA&apos;S design and capabilities reflect our research
focus on allying conversational content with conver-
sation management, and allying nonverbal modali-
ties with speech: how can an embodied-agent aseall
its communicative modalities to contribute new con-
tent when needed (propositional function), to signal
173
Another component of context is provided by a
domain knowledge base, consisting of facts explic-
itly labeled with the kind of information they repre-
sent. This defines the common ground in the con-
versation in terms of sources of information that
speaker and hearer share. Modeling the discourse, as.
a shared source of informaiion *means that new se-
mantic features REA imparts are added to the com-
mon ground as the dialogue proceeds. Following re-
sults from (Kelly et al., 1999) which show that infor-
mation from both speech and gesture is used to pro-
vide context for ongoing talk, our common ground
may be updated by both speech and gesture.
The structured domain knowledge also provides
a resource for specifying communicative strategies.
Recall that REAk&apos;s communicative strategies are for-
mulated in terms of functions which are common
in naturally-occurring dialogues (such as &amp;quot;presenta-
tion&amp;quot;) and which lead to distinctive bundles of con-
tent in gesture and speech. The knowledge base&apos;s
kinds of information provide a mechanism for spec-
ifying and reasoning about such functions. The
knowledge base is structured to describe the rela-
tionship between the system&apos;s private information
and the questions of interest that that information
can be used to settle. Once the user&apos;s words have
been interpreted, a layer of production rules con-
structs obligations for response (Traum and Allen,
1994); then, a second layer plans to meet these obli-
gations by deciding to present a specified kind of
information about a specified object. This deter-
mines some concrete communicative goalsâ€”facts
of this kind that a contribution to dialogue could
make. Both speech and gesture can access the
whole structured database in realizing these concrete
communicative goals. For example, a variety of
facts that bear on where a residence isâ€”which city.
which neighborhood or, if appropriate, where in a
buildingâ€”all provide the same kind of information,
and would therefore fit the obligation to specify the
location of a residence. Or, to implement the rule-
for presentation described in connection with (1), we
can associate an obligation of presentation with a
cluster of facts describing an object&apos;s type, its loca-
tion in a house, and its size, shape or quality.
The communicative context and concrete com-
municative goals provide a common source for gen-
erating speech and gesture in REA. The utterance
generation problem in REA,,then, is to &apos;construct a-
complex communicative action, made up of speech
and coverbal gesture, that achieves a given constel-
lation of goals and tightly fits the context specified
by the dialogue manager.

We model REA&apos;s communicative actions as corn-
-posed--of a veileetiorretatornic-demen ts n clu din g
both lexical items in speech and clusters of seman-
tic features expressed as gestures; since we assume
that any such item usually conveys a specific piece
of content, we refer to these elements generally as
lexicalized descriptors. The generation task in REA
thus involves selecting a number of such lexical-
ized descriptors and organizing them into a gram-
matical whole that manifests the right semantic and
pragmatic coordination between speech and gesture.
The information conveyed must be enough that the
hearer can identify the entity in each domain ref-
erence from among its context set. Moreover, the
descriptors must provide a source which allows the
hearer to recover any needed new domain proposi-
tion, either explicitly or by inference.
We use the SPUD generator (&amp;quot;Sentence Planning
Using Description&amp;quot;) introduced in (Stone and Do-
ran, 1997) to carry out this task for REA. SPUD
builds the utterance element-by-element; at each
stage of construction, SPUD&apos;S representation of the
current, incomplete utterance specifies its syntax,
semantics, interpretation and fit to context. This rep-
resentation both allows SPUD to determine which
lexicalized descriptors are available at each stage to
extend the utterance, and to assess the progress to-
wards its communicative goals which each exten-
sion would bring about. At each stage, then, SPUD
selects the available option that offers the best im-
mediate advance toward completing the utterance
successfully. (We have developed a suite of guide-
lines for the design of syntactic structures, seman-
tic and pragmatic representations, and the interface
between them so that SPUD&apos;S greedy search, which
is necessary for real-time performance, succeeds in
finding concise and effective Utterances -described
by the grammar (Stone et al., 2000).)
As part of the development Of REA, we have con-
structed a new inventory of lexicalized descriptors.
REA &apos;s descriptors consist of entries that contribute
to coverbal gestures, as well as revised entries for
spoken words that allow for their coordination with
gesture under appropriate discourse conditions. The

The interpretation of speech and gesture has been
investigated since the pioneering work of (Bolt,
1980) on deictic gesture; recent work includes
(Koons et al., 1993; Bolt and Heffanz, 1992). Sys-
tems have also attempted generation of gesture in
conjunction with speech. Lester et al. (1998) gener-
ate deictic gestures and choose referring expressions
as a function of the potential ambiguity of objects re-
ferred to, and their proximity to the animated agent.
Rickel and Johnson (1999)&apos;s pedagogical agent pro-
duces a deictic gesture at the beginning of explana-
tions about objects in the virtual world. Andre et
al. (1999) generate pointing gestures as a sub-action
of the rhetorical action of labeling, in turn a sub-
action of elaborating.
Missing from these prior systems, however, is a
representation of communicative action that treats
the different modalities on a par. Such representa-
tions have been explored in research on combining
linguistic and graphical interaction. For example,
multimodal managers have been described to allo-
cate an underlying content representation for gen-
eration of text and graphics (Wahlster et al., 1991.,
Green et al., 1998). Meanwhile, (Johnston et al.,
1997; Johnston, 1998) describe a formalism for
Lightly-coupled interpretation which uses a gram-
mar and semantic constraints to analyze input from
speech and pen. While many insights from these
formalisms are relevant in embodied conversation,
spontaneous gesture requires a distinct analysis with
different emphasis: For example;--we need some no-
tion of discourse pragmatics that would allow us to
predict where gesture occurs with respect to speech,

model of the communicative effects of spontaneous
coverbal gestureâ€”one that allows us to reason nat-
urally about the multiple goals speakers have in pro-
ducing each utterance.

<bodyText confidence="0.999962666666667">
Research on the robustness of human conversation
suggests that a dialogue agent capable of acting
as a conversational partner would provide for effi-
cient and natural collaborative dialogue. But human
conversational partners display gestures that derive
from the same underlying conceptual source as their
speech, and which relate appropriately to their corn-
-municative intent. In this paper, we have summa-
rized the evidence for this view of human conver-
sation, and shown how it informs the generation
of communicative action in our artificial embodied
conversational agent, REA. REA has a working im-
plementation, which includes the modules described
in this paper, and can engage in a variety of interac-
tions including that in (5). Experiments are under-
way to investigate the extent to which REA &apos;s conver-
sational capacities share the strengths of the human
capacities they are modeled on.

In this paper, we describe the generation of communicative actions in an implemented embodied conversational agent. Our generation framework adopts a goal-directed view of generation and casts knowledge about communicative action in the form of a grammar that specifies how forms combine, what interpretive effects they impart and in what contexts they are appropriate (Appelt, 1985; Moore, 1994; Dale, 1992; Stone and Doran, 1997). We expand this framework to take into account findings, by ourselves and others, on the relationship between spontaneous coverbal hand gestures and speech. In particular, our agent plans each utterance so that multiple communicative goals may be realized opportunistically by a composite action including not only speech but also coverbal gesture. By describing gesture declaratively in terms of its discourse function, semantics and synchrony with speech, we ensure that coverbal gesture fits the context and the ongoing speech in ways representati</context>

Choices of remaining elementsâ€”the words garden and nice, the semantic features to represent the garden in the gestureâ€”proceed similarly. Thus SPUD arrives at the response in (5b) just by reasoning from the declarative specification of the meaning and context of communicative actions. 6 Related Work The interpretation of speech and gesture has been investigated since the pioneering work of (Bolt, 1980) on deictic gesture; recent work includes (Koons et al., 1993; Bolt and Heffanz, 1992). Systems have also attempted generation of gesture in conjunction with speech. Lester et al. (1998) generate deictic gestures and choose referring expressions as a function of the potential ambiguity of objects referred to, and their proximity to the animated agent. Rickel and Johnson (1999)&apos;s pedagogical agent produces a deictic gesture at the beginning of explanations about objects in the virtual world. Andre et al.

Of course, communication is still possible without gesture. But it has been shown that when speech is ambiguous (Thompson and Massaro, 1986) or in a speech situation with some noise (Rogers, 1978), listeners do rely on gestural cues (and, the higher the noise-to-signal ratio, the more facilitation by gesture). Similarly, Cassell et al. (1999) established that listeners rely on information conveyed only in gesture as they try to comprehend a story. Most interesting in terms of building interactive dialogue systems is the semantic and pragmatic relationship between gesture and speech. The two channels do not always manifest the same information, but what they convey is virtually always compatible. Semantically, speech and gesture give a consistent view of an overall situation.

Research on embodied conversational agents aims to imbue interactive dialogue systems with the same nonverbal skills and behaviors (Cassell, 2000a). There is good reason to think that nonverbal behavior will play an important role in evoking from users the kinds of communicative dialogue behaviors they use with other humans, and thus allow them to use the computer with the same kind of efficiency and smoothness that characterizes their dialogues with other people. For example, (Cassell and Thorisson, 1999) show that humans are more likely to consider computers lifelike, and to rate their language skills more highly, when those computers display not only speech but appropriate nonverbal communicative behavior_ This argument takes on par</context>

Pragmatically, speech and gesture mark information about this meaning as advancing the purposes of the conversation in a consistent way. Indeed, gesture often emphasizes information that is also focused pragmatically by mechanisms like prosody in speech (Cassell, 2000b).

We expand this framework to take into account findings, by ourselves and others, on the relationship between spontaneous coverbal hand gestures and speech. In particular, our agent plans each utterance so that multiple communicative goals may be realized opportunistically by a composite action including not only speech but also coverbal gesture. By describing gesture declaratively in terms of its discourse function, semantics and synchrony with speech, we ensure that coverbal gesture fits the context and the ongoing speech in ways representative of natural human conve</context>

For example, (Cassell and Thorisson, 1999) show that humans are more likely to consider computers lifelike, and to rate their language skills more highly, when those computers display not only speech but appropriate nonverbal communicative behavior_ This argument takes on particular importance given that users repeat themselves needlessly, mistake when it is their turn to speak, and so forth when interacting with voice dialogue systems (Oviatt, 1995): In life, noisy situations like these provoke the non-verbal modalities to come into play (Rogers, 1978). In this paper, we describe the generation of communicative actions in an implemented embodied conversational agent. Our generation framework adopts a goal-directed view of generation and casts knowledge about communicative action in the form of a grammar that specifies how forms combine, what interpretive effects they impart and in what contexts they are appropriate (Appelt, 1985; Moore, 1994; Dale, 1992; Stone and Doran, 1997).

About three-quarters of all clauses in narrative discourse are accompanied by gestures of one kind or another (McNeill, 1992), and within those clauses, the most effortful part of gestures tends to co-occur with or just before the phonologically most prominent syllable of the accompanying speech (Kendon, 1974). Of course, communication is still possible without gesture. But it has been shown that when speech is ambiguous (Thompson and Massaro, 1986) or in a speech situation with some noise (Rogers, 1978), listeners do rely on gestural cues (and, the higher the noise-to-signal ratio, the more facilitation by gesture). Similarly, Cassell et al. (1999) established that listeners rely on information conveyed only in gesture as they try to comprehend a story. Most interesting in terms of building interactive dialogue systems is the semantic and pragmatic relationship between gesture and speech. The two channels do not always manifest the same information, but what they convey is virtually always compatible. Semantically, speech and gesture give a consistent view of an overall situation.

We expand this framework to take into account findings, by ourselves and others, on the relationship between spontaneous coverbal hand gestures and speech. In particular, our agent plans each utterance so that multiple communicative goals may be realized opportunistically by a composite action including not only speech but also coverbal gesture. By describing gesture declaratively in terms of its discourse function, semantics and synchrony with speech, we ensure that coverbal gesture fits the context and the ongoing speech in ways representative of natural human conversation. The result is a</context>

The generation task in REA thus involves selecting a number of such lexicalized descriptors and organizing them into a grammatical whole that manifests the right semantic and pragmatic coordination between speech and gesture. The information conveyed must be enough that the hearer can identify the entity in each domain reference from among its context set. Moreover, the descriptors must provide a source which allows the hearer to recover any needed new domain proposition, either explicitly or by inference. We use the SPUD generator (&amp;quot;Sentence Planning Using Description&amp;quot;) introduced in (Stone and Doran, 1997) to carry out this task for REA. SPUD builds the utterance element-by-element; at each stage of construction, SPUD&apos;S representation of the current, incomplete utterance specifies its syntax, semantics, interpretation and fit to context. This representation both allows SPUD to determine which lexicalized descriptors are available at each stage to extend the utterance, and to assess the progress towards its communicative goals which each extension would bring about. At each stage, then, SPUD selects the available option that offers the best immediate advance toward completing the utterance succe</context>

The knowledge base&apos;s kinds of information provide a mechanism for specifying and reasoning about such functions. The knowledge base is structured to describe the relationship between the system&apos;s private information and the questions of interest that that information can be used to settle. Once the user&apos;s words have been interpreted, a layer of production rules constructs obligations for response (Traum and Allen, 1994); then, a second layer plans to meet these obligations by deciding to present a specified kind of information about a specified object. This determines some concrete communicative goalsâ€”facts of this kind that a contribution to dialogue could make. Both speech and gesture can access the whole structured database in realizing these concrete communicative goals. For example, a variety of facts that bear on where a residence isâ€”which city. which neighborhood or, if appropriate, where in a buildingâ€”all provide the same kind of information, and would therefore fit the obligation to specify the loca</context>

Pragmatically, speech and gesture mark information about this meaning as advancing the purposes of the conversation in a consistent way. Indeed, gesture often emphasizes information that is also focused pragmatically by mechanisms like prosody in speech (Cassell, 2000b). The semantic and pragmatic compatibility seen in the gesturespeech relationship recalls the interaction of words and graphics in multimodal presentations (Feiner and McKeown, 1991; Green et al., 1998; Wahlster et al., 1991). In fact, some suggest (McNeill, 1992), that gesture and speech arise together from an underlying representation that has both visual and linguistic aspects, and so the relationship between gesture and speech is essential to the production of meaning and to its comprehension. This theoretical perspective on speech and gesture involves two key claims with computational import: that gesture and speech .reflect-a- common conceptual source; and that the content and form of a gesture is tuned to the communicative context and the actor&apos;s communicative intentions. We believe that these characteristi</context>

Andre et al. (1999) generate pointing gestures as a sub-action of the rhetorical action of labeling, in turn a subaction of elaborating. Missing from these prior systems, however, is a representation of communicative action that treats the different modalities on a par. Such representations have been explored in research on combining linguistic and graphical interaction. For example, multimodal managers have been described to allocate an underlying content representation for generation of text and graphics (Wahlster et al., 1991., Green et al., 1998). Meanwhile, (Johnston et al., 1997; Johnston, 1998) describe a formalism for Lightly-coupled interpretation which uses a grammar and semantic constraints to analyze input from speech and pen. While many insights from these formalisms are relevant in embodied conversation, spontaneous gesture requires a distinct analysis with different emphasis: For example;--we need some notion of discourse pragmatics that would allow us to predict where gesture occurs with respect to speech, and what its role might be. Likewise, we need a model of the communicative effects of spontaneou</context>
