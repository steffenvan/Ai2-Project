<bodyText confidence="0.9998546">
We assess the use of hedge phrases in “affec-

non-native speakers prefer texts that contain hedge
phrases, but native speakers prefer texts that do not
contain hedge phrases.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998164375">
In recent years there has been growing interest in
“affective” Natural Language Generation (NLG).
Affective NLG has been defined as: “NLG that re-
lates to, arises from or deliberately influences emo-
tions or other non-strictly rational aspects of the
Hearer” (de Rosis, 2001).
One open issue in affective NLG is how texts
that communicate emotionally sensitive information
should be worded. In this paper we focus on the
usage of ’hedge phrases’ which communicate em-
pathetic information, such as &amp;quot;unfortunately.&amp;quot; An
experiment in the domain of communicating exam
results to students suggests that such emphathetic
hedge phrases are appreciated by non-native En-
glish speakers, but disliked by native English speak-
ers.

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950571428571">
Some NLG systems produce texts that communicate
emotionally sensitive information. In particular, the
BT-Parent system, which is part of the BabyTalk
project (Portet et al., 2007; Reiter, 2007), produces
texts that summarise the condition of a baby in a
neonatal intensive care unit, for the baby’s parents.
Such texts must be worded in a way which min-
imises emotional distress, while of course still be-
ing truthful. The work here is an initial attempt
to explore one aspect of how sensitive information
should be communicated. Because of ethical con-
siderations, we have conducted this initial experi-
ment with a different group, students who are being
told about exam results.

3 Hedge Phrases
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999429256410256">
Hedging can be described as a strategy by which
speakers mitigate and soften the force of their utter-
ances (Nikula, 1997). The term was first coined by
Lakoff (1973), but the original definition has been
widened in part due to the observation that certain
verbs and syntactic constructions convey hedged
performatives (Markkanen and Schröder, 1997a).
Verbs such as suppose, guess, and think are ex-
amples of these hedged performatives. However
these verbs have also been defined as hedges that
affect the amount of commitment which a speaker
may have to the truth-value of a particular sen-
tence (Markkanen and Schröder, 1997a). Prince et
al. (1982) in their analysis on hedging found that
hedges can be be classified into two distinct groups
with respect to their effect on the truth-value.The
first are approximators which do modify the truth-
condition of the proposition (e.g. I suppose the sky
is blue). The second is shields which unlike ap-
proximators do not affect the truth-conditon of the
proposition, but instead show the amount of com-
mitment that the speaker/writer has to the proposi-
tion (e.g. I think his feet are blue) (Markkanen and
Schröder, 1997a).
In the hedging literature distinctions are not al-
ways made between the strategies to be applied and
the modifying devices used to achieve the hedg-
ing (Clemen, 1997). The five distinct strategies de-
fined by Clemen (1997) are: Politeness, Indirect-
ness, Mitigation, Vagueness, and Understatement.
It can be argued that hedging is determined by a
combination of factors, namely the type of con-
text (discourse type), the colloquial situation, the
speaker’s/writer’s intention and knowledge of the
background dialogue/conversation (Clemen, 1997).
The aspects of hedging that were of interest to us
was the usage of evaluative adverbs (Bonami and
Godard, 2006) as a modifying device (such as un-
fortunately, sadly, etc.) combined with aspects of

defined by Clemen (1997).
whereas back hedges are phrases that are inserted
after a proposition:

4 Empathy in NLG
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968157894737">
Reiter et al. (2000) asked two doctors to rewrite a
computer-generated smoking cessation letter, with
one doctor asked to enhance the empathy of the let-
ter and another doctor asked to enhance the read-
ability of the letter, thus producing two differing
letters. They then asked 20 smokers which ver-
sion they preferred, and why. They found strong
individual differences, with 8 smokers preferring
one version and 9 smokers preferring the other (and
3 expressing no preference). In terms of qualita-
tive comments, some of the participants finding the
empathic version too “patronising”, whilst others
found it to be “encouraging”.
Perhaps the most important lesson from this ex-
periment is that there seem to be major individual
differences in how diffent people react to “empa-
thetic” texts. Hence it would be very helpful if we
could create rules which predicted which texts peo-
ple prefer, based on their characteristics.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.989824" genericHeader="method">
5 System Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812363636364">
We created a simple NLG system which generated
short texts which summarised the exam results of a
student; this used the simplenlg API (Reiter, 2007).
The system can insert evaluative adverbs (words and
phrases) into generated sentences. These adverbs
were classified into two distinct groups: Negative
hedges and Positive hedges. Negative hedges were
adverbs that were used when a given proposition
was negative in content. While the positive hedges
were used when dealing with a positive content. The
example below illustrates these two types of hedges:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997635">
(1) Unfortunately, you got CAS 9 in CS5038
(2) Happily, the CAS result for CS5035 was 19
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999531090909091">
The Common Assessment Scale (CAS) score is a
scoring mechanism used by the University of Ab-
erdeen. The scale comprises of 21 discrete points
with 0 being the lowest and 20 being the highest
score. For the NLG system, a student’s score was
used to determine whether a given proposition was
positive or negative.
There were also two different types of hedges
deployed; Front hedges and back hedges. Front
hedges, as illustrated above, are hedges in which an
adverb is injected in front of a given proposition,

(3) Sadly, you got CAS 9 in CS5035 and CS5037.
Hopefully, this won’t effect your degree re-
sult by much.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999758666666667">
Our system randomly chooses which hedge phrase
to use; however, it will never insert more than one
front hedge or more than one back hedge into a sen-
tence.
The system differs from the ADVISOR expert
system (Elhadad, 1991) because of its focus on a
specific collection of adverbial words that act as
hedges rather than using adjectives for argumenta-
tive usage.

6 Experiment

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.946351">
6.1 Aims
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999706">
This initial experiment compared the individual
preference of participants when presented with
hedged and non-hedged texts from our system. The
texts gave results for mythical students, not for the
experiment participants.

6.2 Participants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998764272727273">
The trial for this experiment was organised as fol-
lows. A 1-page, double-sided questionnaire was
distributed to a total of 37 Masters students (9 fe-
males and 28 males). A total of 5 questionnaires
were rejected as incomplete. In the experiment 14
participants were native and fluent in English (Na-
tive speakers), whilst 18 participants were not native
to the English language. The 18 non-native English
speakers were asked if they were fluent in English:
7 said they were (Fluent speakers), and 11 said they
were not (Non-fluent speakers).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995305">
6.3 Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975916666667">
The questionnaire in the experiment showed to each
participant an artificially generated exam test result
for two differing scenarios. The first was in a pos-
itive context in which a hypothetical student has
achieved a set of high results. The second in a neg-
ative context in which a set of low results was pre-
sented. For each scenario participants were shown
two texts summarising the exam results: one with-
out hedges (Text A) and one with hedges (Text B).
The participants were asked to state which of the
two texts they would prefer in the context of having
their results delivered to them.

6.4 Evaluation Criteria

<bodyText confidence="0.99923">
The questionnaire asked each participant for a set
of personal details; Age, English fluency level, and
gender. The main questionnaire then consisted of
two sections as described in the previous section.

Subjects were asked to state a preference which
ran from -3 for Text A to + 3 for Text B. If both texts
were considered by a participant to be the same then
a score of 0 was given. The participants were asked
to provide free text comments on why they made
their particular choice of text.

6.5 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959571428572">
The overall results in this experiment were calcu-
lated by a mean average of the participants selec-
tion of hedging preference in sections 1 and 2 of the
questionnaire. These results are presented in table
1. It is quite clear that on average most participants
favoured texts without any form of hedging. How-
ever, if we break the results down by language flu-
ency a different picture emerges.
A one-way ANOVA statistical analysis shows a
significant effect by group (p = 0.01). Further anal-
ysis using Post-Hoc Tukey HSD shows a significant
difference (p = 0.013) between native and fluent
speaker groups. This significant difference is also
present between native and non-fluent (p = 0.002)
speaker groups. There was no significant differ-
ence (p = 0.487) between the fluent and non-fluent
speaker groups. It can be concluded from this sta-
tistical analysis that there is a correlation between
native/non-native status and the amount of prefer-
ence for hedged and non-hedged texts.
In comparing the number of participants that pre-
ferred hedged text in sections 1 &amp; 2 it seems that 16
people preferred the hedged text in section 1 com-
pared to 8 people who preferred the opposite ten-
dency in section 2. However, there was no statis-
tical significant factor found which determined the
preference of either hedged text when a univariate
analysis of variance was conducted.

<bodyText confidence="0.999955948717949">
From the results above we can see that there is a
statistical correlation between the overall preference
for these types of hedges and whether the partici-
pant is a native speaker. This correlation between
being a native speaker and preference for hedging
may be partially due to the differing cultural ex-
pectations in text of non-native speakers compared
to those that have English as their primary lan-
guage. This is consistent with research conducted
by Crismore et al. (1993) which has shown that
there is a difference in the amount of hedges used
in written text between Finnish and American Uni-
versity students.
The scenario in which the hedges were inserted
may play a role in defining the preference for hedg-
ing. One of the typical comments which was
repeated by several native speakers was that the
hedges were less favourable since they were inap-
propriate for the textual content type. In general the
hedges were perceived to be adding opinion to text
or were just “wishy-washy”. The quote below is
from a native speaker and is a good overall repre-
sentative of the comments received:
“[Text] B is over-personal, yet in this
context it could be constructed as conde-
scending as well. Although [Text] A is
a bit more abrupt, it’s more formal and
suited to University letters.”
Such sentiments were not as pervasive in the other
speaker groups, which instead commented on how
the hedged text was more “humanised” and com-
fortable. An example of this from a non-fluent
speaker is shown below:
“Good result, so ‘wonderful’ can make
the student happy. Humanised.”
It is possible that cultural expectations may play a
big role in the wide disparity in perception between
the native and non-native speaker groups. However,
it is also possible that the preference for such hedges

just reflects the varying degrees of English under-
standing by the different groups. Such “hedges”
may act as “emotional navigators” for those who
aren’t fluent with English language conventions. On
the other hand it is quite possible that the preference
for hedging is based upon personal preference rather
than any singular principle.

8 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993058823529">
There are at least two areas that need further inves-
tigation. The first is to explore the impact that cul-
tural background may have on a particular individ-
ual’s preference for hedging. It would be interesting
to see the types of hedges preferred by some cul-
tures and the ones that aren’t. It is possible that this
line of research could in turn allow a NLG system
to adapt its textual output depending on the cultural
background of the recipient.
The second area would look into defining a model
for hedging. Currently there is no model for the
placement and frequency of hedges within NLG
text. One approach for defining such a model would
be to look into the statistical frequency of hedges
within different corpora to see whether there are any
particular defining grammatical or contextual fea-
tures that are shared between hedges.

The aspects of hedging that were of interest to us was the usage of evaluative adverbs (Bonami and Godard, 2006) as a modifying device (such as unfortunately, sadly, etc.) combined with aspects of 155 the Indirectness and Mitigation hedging strategies defined by Clemen (1997). whereas back hedges are phrases that are inserted after a proposition: 4 Empathy in NLG Reiter et al. (2000) asked two doctors to rewrite a computer-generated smoking cessation letter, with one doctor asked to enhance the empathy of the letter and another doctor asked to enhance the readability of the letter, thus producing two differing letters. They then asked 20 smokers which version they preferred, and why. They found strong individual differences, with 8 smokers preferring one version and 9 smokers preferring the other (and 3 expressing no preference). In terms of qualitative comments, some of the participants finding the empathic version too “patronising”, whilst others found it to be “encoura</context>

Perhaps the most important lesson from this experiment is that there seem to be major individual differences in how diffent people react to “empathetic” texts. Hence it would be very helpful if we could create rules which predicted which texts people prefer, based on their characteristics. 5 System Implementation We created a simple NLG system which generated short texts which summarised the exam results of a student; this used the simplenlg API (Reiter, 2007). The system can insert evaluative adverbs (words and phrases) into generated sentences. These adverbs were classified into two distinct groups: Negative hedges and Positive hedges. Negative hedges were adverbs that were used when a given proposition was negative in content. While the positive hedges were used when dealing with a positive content. The example below illustrates these two types of hedges: (1) Unfortunately, you got CAS 9 in CS5038 (2) Happily, the CAS result for CS5035 was 19 The Common Assessment Scale (CAS) score is a scoring mechanism used by the University of Aberdeen.
