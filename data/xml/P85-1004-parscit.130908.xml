This paper proposes an analysis method for
Japanese modality. In this purpose, meaning of
Japanese modality is classified into four semantic
categories and the role of it is formalized into five
modality functions. Based on these formalizations,
information and constraints to be applied to the
modality analysis procedure are specified. Then by
combining these investigations with case analysis, the
analysis method is proposed. This analysis method has
been applied to Japanese analysis for machine
translation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999951086956522">
Since the meaning of a sentence consists of both
proposition and modality,I21 analysis of modality is as
indispensable as that of proposition for natural
language understanding and machine translation.
However studies on natural language analysis have
mainly concerned with the propositional part, and
algorithms for analyzing modality have not yet been
sufficiently developed. The aim of this paper is to
clarify the function of modality and to propose a method
for analyzing the modality in Japanese sentences.
Structure of a Japanese complex sentence can be
formalized roughly by iterbtive concatenation of simple
sentences. The simple sentence consists of eases and a
predicate. The cases have surface representations of
noun phrases or adverb phrases while the predicate has
that of verb or adjective or adjective verb. A noun
phrase is defined as the recursive concatenation of noun
phrase or that of embedded sentence. We have
employed the case structure as a basic meaning
structure for a simple sentence, and extended it to
retain the construction of complex sentences
mentioned. Modality is additive information
represented by auxiliary words such as modal particles,
ending particles, and auxiliary verbs and sentence
adverbs. The modal particle is attached to a noun
phrase or a sentence element while the ending particle
is attached to the eoci position of a sentence. The
auxiliary verb immediately follows a verb phrase.
Modality represented in such grammatically different
context is incorporated into the ease structure, and the
result construction is named as an extended case
structurem which enable us to propose a uniform
framework for analyzing both proposition and modality.
In this paper, we first classify modality into four
semantic categories. Second, we define five modality
functions using the logical representation of the
meaning and then characterize the roles of each
function. Third, we specify hard problems to be
resolved in modality analysis. Fourth, we list. the
information and constraints to be considered in
establishing the procedure of modality analysis. Then,
we propose a method for analyzing modality based on
these investigations. Finally, we exemplify the
analysis by showing translations from Japanese into
English. The method has been used to analyze
Japanese sentences in a machine translation systerICI

2. Classification of modality
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993860210526316">
Traditionally, modality has been classified into
three categories, i.e. tense, aspect and modal.:21 This
classification is not sufficient for the deep analysis of
the meaning structure of a sentence, however, because
it does not account for the role of Japanese modal
particles. Adding this role, we expand this
classification into four categories, namely tense, aspect,
modal and implicature shown in Table 1. Each category
can be further classified into subcategories, and those
are shown in Table 2 through Table 5 (Each table gives
both examples of Japanese expressions and their
English equivalents). Our classification of modality
features two characteristics concerning the assignment
of adverbs and modal particles:
(1) Among the two kinds of adverbs, namely
sentence adverbs and case adverbs, we assign
sentence adverbs to modality while case
adverbs to case relations. Sentence adverbs are
classified into three subcategories in the modal

3. Modality functions and their roles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997558923076923">
By employing logical expression as the
representation of the meaning structure, we can define
modality functions as operations on logical expressions
in strict terms. In the past, studies on modality
analysis in logical framework treated each type of
modality individuallyisllsi Here, we deal with it,
however, as a whole and combine it with the
propositional structure so that we can provide a
uniform framework for the representation and the
analysis of the meaning structure. In this purpose we
employ the higher order modal logic formalism.&amp;quot;&apos;
In this regard, we introduce the five types of
modality functions, which add or modify modality:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9963866">
(1) addition of the modality operator,
(2) surface modification of the case structure,
(3) semantic modification of the case structure,
(4) determination of the scope of negation,
(5) addition of the implicative meaning.

<bodyText confidence="0.992139666666667">
We will now discuss the roles of each type of
modality function respectively by indicating their
logical representations.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999984">
3.1 Addition of the modality operator
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9448902">
This is the most fundamental function and it simply
adds the modality meaning to the propositional
meaning. In the following two sentences, (Si) has no
modality while (s2) has modality:
(sl) Hiroko ga hashiru. (Hiroko runs.)

3.2 Surface modification of the case structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995471375">
This does not change the logical meaning structure
even when the surface structure is modified. However
higher level information such as focus and attention is
sometimes added.
The passive auxiliary verb &amp;quot;reru&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot; can
modify the surface case structure without changing the
logical meaning structure. The focus is usually placed
on the subject part of the passive sentence, as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.915271">
(s3) Hiroko ga yasai wo taberu.
(Hiroko eats vegetables.),
3x( Vegetable( x)A.Eat( Hi roko.x )),

3.3 Semantic modification of the case structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.762630428571429">
This results in one of the two alternatives :
(a) one argument is added to the original predicate,
(13) a higher order predicate is introduced.
Both changes are equivalent in meaning but the way of
representing the change is different.
The following fragments of modality cause the
semantic modification of the case structure :

For an example, the causative auxiliary verb &amp;quot;seru&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;saseru&amp;quot; results in (a) the addition of the causative
agent, or (b) the introduction of a second-order
predicate CAUSE(x,y) in which argument x represents
the causative agent and argument y represents a
predicate, as follows:

Eat(Hiroko,x))),
where the predicate Eat&apos;(x, y, z) is obtained by adding
the argument z corresponding to the causative agent to
the predicate Eat(x, y) in (s3).
For another example, though the auxiliary verb
&amp;quot;reru&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot; has five meanings, namely,
&amp;quot;passive&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;affected-passive&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ability&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;respective&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;spontaneity&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; meaning among them falls
into type (2) above while &amp;quot;affected-passive&amp;quot; meaning
falls into this type and the affected-agent is added :

4. Problems in modality analysis
4.1 Ambiguity of the modality meaning
(1) Ambiguity due to multiple meaning
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.827932">
The aspect expression &amp;quot;teiru&amp;quot; has three different
kinds of meanings, that is, the &amp;quot;durative&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;iterative&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;terminative-state&amp;quot; aspects. For example,
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.813856714285714">

(Hiroko {is eating, eats and eats, has eaten}

Eat(Hiroko, x)).
(2) Ambiguity concerned with case structure
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.968272307692307">
As stated in Section 3.3 above, the auxiliary verb
&amp;quot;reru&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot; has five meanings, and, among them,
the &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;affected-passive&amp;quot; meanings result in
modification to the case structure. Therefore,
disambiguation of the meaning of &amp;quot;reru&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot;
has a close relationship to analysis of the propositional
meaning.
Moreover the auxiliary verb &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot; in the
following (s12) means &amp;quot;respect&amp;quot;, and that in (s13)
means &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot;, respectively. Whereas, both
expressions are same except the additional meaning of
respect and focus, as follows :
(s12)Sensei ga yasai wo tabe rareru.

where the predicate Respect(x,y) means that x respects
y.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996109">
4.2 Scope of modality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9028582">
Even if the main clause has a negative expression, it
does not always mean that the main clause is negated.
Sometimes the subordinate clause is negated. We call
this phenomenon the transfer of negation.
Furthermore even if modality involved is not negation,
it sometimes affects the subordinate clause.
Although the main clause in the following (s14) is
not usually negated, the subordinate clause is.
Nevertheless, the tense information in the main clause
has an effect on the subordinate clause. (s14) is
constructed from (s14-1) and (s14-2) by a simple
coordinate conjunction, however the corresponding
logical expression is not a simple concatenation of each
logical expression:
(s14)Taro wa hige wo sot te kaisha e ika nakat ta.
(Taro went to the company without shaving.)
[past] --.Shave(Taro,beard)
A(past]Go(Taro,Company),
(s14-1)Taro wa hige wo soru. (Taro shaves beard.)
Shave(Taro, beard),
(s14-2)Taro wa kaisha e ika nakat ta.
(Taro did not go to the company.)
(past)-”Go(Taro, Company).
(s8) and (s9) also exemplify the problem for determining
the scope of negation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999563">
4.3 Treatment of implicative meaning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962799058823529">
Modal particles such as &amp;quot;shika (only)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sae
(even)&amp;quot; convey individual implicative meaning. In
order to obtain the logical representation of the
implicative meaning, we are forced to provide different
formulae expressive of the each meaning of each modal
particle. For example, if we assign the formula (fl) to
the expression &amp;quot;shika...nai&amp;quot; which consists of the modal
particle &amp;quot;shika&amp;quot; and auxiliary verb &amp;quot;nai&amp;quot;, we get the
logical representation of the sentence (s10) by the
procedure of A-calculus shown in Fig. 1.
( fl APXQXR( 3x(P( x )ARQ( x))
Ax(--,P(x)DR-,Q(x))).
As can be seen from the example, the logical formula for
the implicative meaning is very individual. This
concludes that specification of it for each meaning is
very complicated and hard, and a more effective method
is therefore needed.

5. Information and constraints on modality
analysis
(1) Lexical meaning
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989041857142857">
The lexical meaning assigned to each modality
expression is the most fundamental information. So we
need to specify and provide it. For example, the lexical
meaning of the auxiliary verb &amp;quot;ta&amp;quot; is generally the
&amp;quot;past&amp;quot; tense as in :
(s15)Hiroko ga hashit ta. (Hiroko ran.)
(past)Run(Hiroko).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.864054">
(2) Predicate features
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7259735">
Predicate features are available for disambiguating
the meaning of modality.
Though the aspect auxiliary verb &amp;quot;teiru&amp;quot; is
ambiguous in meaning, we can resolve it by using
predicate features such as the &amp;quot;stative&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;continuous&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;spontaneous&amp;quot;, as in:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992836">

[clurative]llun(Hiroko),
(s17)Akari ga kie teiru. (The light is turned off)
(terminative-statelTurn-off(the-Light),
where the verb &amp;quot;hashiru (run)&amp;quot; has the &amp;quot;continuous&amp;quot;
feature while the verb &amp;quot;kieru (turn off)&amp;quot; has the
&amp;quot;spontaneous&amp;quot; feature. The aspect expression &amp;quot;teiru&amp;quot;
following a &amp;quot;continuous&amp;quot; verb usually means the
&amp;quot;durative&amp;quot; aspect, and &amp;quot;teiru&amp;quot; following a
&amp;quot;spontaneous&amp;quot; verb usually means the &amp;quot;terminative-
state&amp;quot; aspect.
The &amp;quot;spontaneity&amp;quot; meaning of &amp;quot;reru&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot; is
realized only when it follows the verbs having
spontaneity feature such as &amp;quot;omoidasu (remember)&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;anjiru (care)&amp;quot;.

(6) Semantic relations between the subordinate

This information is used to determine the scope of
negation in the main clause. In the subordinate clause
with the conjunctive particle &amp;quot;te&apos;&apos;, if the event expressed
by it is subsidiary for the occurrence of the event in the
main clause, the transfer of negation can occur. On the
other hand, if the subordinate event is indispensable to
the occurrence of the main event, the transfer never
occurs. For example, in (s14), since the modifier event
Shave(Taro,beard) is a subsidiary event for the
occurrence of the main event Go(Taro,Company), the
transfer of negation is possible. In the following
sentence (s21), however, since the event Go(Taro,
Washington) is an indispensable event for the
occurrnece of the main event See(Taro,White-House),
the transfer is impossible :
(s21)Taro wa Washington e it te
White House wo mi nakat ta.
(Taro did not see the White House
when he went to Washington.)

6.1 Strategy of the modality analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981">
Considering the five modality functions defined in
Section 3, it is apparent that the logical analysis
method alone is not effective for modality analysis.
There are three reasons for this:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992162166666667">
(1) Reference to other expressions is needed to
resolve the ambiguity of the modality function,
(2) Structural modification occurs when the scope
of negation is transferred,
(3) Analysis of the implicative meaning sometimes
cause the change of logical expression.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.948263470588235">
There remains, however, the problem of taking the
individuality of each modality into account. For some
kinds of modality, the result of the case analysis or the
conjunctive analysis is used to analyze it. These
represent the reasons why we propose an analysis
method consisting of the following three modules
combined with the case analysis and the conjunctive
analysis:
(1)pre-case-analysis :
activated before the case analysis,
(2)post-case-analysis :
activated after the case analysis,
(3)post-conjunctive-analysis :
activated after the conjunctive analysis.
The relationship of these three modules to the case
analysis and the conjunctive analysis is shown in Fig.

• 6.2 Algorithms of each sub-analysis
(1) Pre-case-analysis
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997525">
The modality whose analysis requires only lexical
meaning or which causes a change of the case structure
is analysed at this stage. The case frame to be assigned
to the predicate is mcdified by utilizing the result of
this analysis before starting the case analysis. As for
the semantically ambiguous auxiliary verb &amp;quot;reru&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot;, its role is only predicted at this stage, because
it is also concerned with the modification of the case
structure. After case analysis, the plausibility of the
prediction is evaluated. The modification of the case
frame is as follows:
(a) For the &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; meaning of &amp;quot;reru&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&apos;went&amp;quot;
(which causes a surface change to the case
structure as mentioned in Section 3.2), the
object case of the original case frame is changed
into the surface subjective case, and the modality
category &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; is assigned to the meaning
structure. If two object cases exist, two possible
modifications are performed.
(b) With the modality causing a semantic change to
the case structure (for the modality function
stated in Section 3.3), a new case is added as
follows:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.586105">
(b1)For the

causative&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;affected-passive&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;hope&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;request&amp;quot; meaning : A new agent (e.g.
causative-agent affected-agent) is added, and
the case particle of the original subjective case is
changed from &amp;quot;ga&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;ni&amp;quot;,
(b2)With the &amp;quot;benefit&amp;quot; meaning : A beneficiary
case is added. The case particle in this case is
&amp;quot;ni&amp;quot;.
Also the modality category corresponding to
each meaning (e.g. &amp;quot;causative&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;affected-
passive&amp;quot;) is assigned to the meaning structure.
(2) Post-case-analysis
The modality whose analysis requires case structure
information is analyzed at this stage. This module
determines the function of the modality as follows:
(a) If the category of the modality expression is
unique, this category is assigned to the meaning
3tructure.
(b) if a daemon (a procedure to resolve ambiguities
by using heuristics) is attached to the modality
expression, it performs the three tasks:
(b1) disambiguating the function of the modality
expression,
(b2) determining the scope,
(b3) adding the implicative meaning.
The daemon utilizes the information mentioned in (1) -

6.3 Application to Japanese analysis
(1) Extended case analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982596507042254">
We have already proposed a method named
extended case analysis for Japanese sentences.m Input
to the extended case analysis is an ordered list of word
frames produced by a morphological analysis. The
analysis begins to predict a constituent construction of
the sentence to be analyzed by utilizing syntactic
structure patterns, and then enter into the detail
analysis of semantic relations between pairs of the
modifier and the modificant by utilizing semantic
relation frames. There are four types of the semantic
relations, namely, case relation, noun concept relation,
embeding relation and conjunctive relation. All of
these semantic relations are analyzed in a uniform
framework. The both analyses go on iteratively and/or
recursively from a small chunk of constituents to large
one. Each iteration and recursion executes both the
prediction of the syntactic structure and the analysis of
semantic structure. The modality analysis is
incorporated into those processes.
Let us show the modality analysis process for the
following example sentence:
(s22)Niku wa nokot teite,
yasai dake ga Hiroko ni tabe rare teita.
Meat had remained, and
only vegetables had been eaten by Hiroko.
At first, it is analysed that this sentence is a complex
sentence by utilizing syntactic structure patterns.
After semantic structures of the modifier and the main
clause are analysed, conjunctive relation between these
clauses is analyzed. Now, we show analysis of the main
sentence.
The following case elements and a predicate are
analysed by applying structure patterns before starting
case analysis:
casel = &amp;quot;yasai&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;ga&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;dake&amp;quot;,
case2 = &amp;quot;Hiroko&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;ni&amp;quot;,
predicate = &amp;quot;taberu&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;teiru&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ta&amp;quot;,
where &amp;quot;dake&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;teiru&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;ta&amp;quot; are modality
expressions. &amp;quot;Hiroko&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;yasai&amp;quot; have semantic
categories, (human) and [food] respectively in each
word frame.
(2) Modification of case frame
Case frame is prepared for each meaning of each
predicate. An intrinsic case frame for the verb &amp;quot;taberu
(eat)&amp;quot; is as follows (Optional cases such as time and
place are omitted here) :
[the intrinsic case frame of the verb &amp;quot;taberu (eat)&amp;quot;]:
Agent = [human] , &amp;quot;ga&apos;&apos;,
Object = [food], &amp;quot;wo&amp;quot;.
Each case slot in the case frame is assigned semantic
categories and case particles as constraints to be
satisfied by the filler.
The following alternative case frames produced by
modifying the intrinsic frame are also prepared before
starting case analysis because of the existence of the
auxiliary verb &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot;:
[&amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; modification of the case frame] :
Agent = [human] , &amp;quot;ni&amp;quot;,
Object = [food] , &amp;quot;ga&amp;quot;,
[&amp;quot;affected-passive&amp;quot; modification of the case frame] :
Affected-agent = [human] , &amp;quot;ga&amp;quot;,
Agent = [human] ,&amp;quot;ni&amp;quot;,
Object = (food] , &amp;quot;wo&amp;quot;.
These three case frames are examined whether each
case element in the sentence satisfies constraints. As a
result, in this case, &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; modification case frame is
selected as a best matching, and case role of each case
element is determined as follows :
casel= Object, case2 =Agent.
This result is showing that the meaning of &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot; is
&amp;quot;passive&amp;quot;.

meaning is determined as &amp;quot;terminative-state&amp;quot; judging
from the fact that &amp;quot;teiru&amp;quot; follows &amp;quot;rareru&amp;quot;. The
meaning of the modal particle &amp;quot;dake&amp;quot; is multiple, that
is, &amp;quot;limitation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;degree&amp;quot;. In this case, &amp;quot;limitation&amp;quot;
is selected by heuristics.
(4) Determination of scope of modality in the main
clause
After conjunctive analysis between the modifier and
the main clause, scope of the auxiliary verb &amp;quot;ta&amp;quot; in the
main clause is analyzed. Using heuristics shown in
Fig. 4, it is analyzed that &amp;quot;ta&amp;quot; also &apos;operates on the
subordinate clause.
In a result, the meaning structure of (s22) is
obtained as follows:
3x((Meat(x)A(past][terrninative-state IRemai n( x))

Avx((--Vegetable(x)

A{Focus(x)}).
An English sentence corresponding to this semantic
structure is shown in (s22).

(1) [speech act] As shown in (s24), modality contains
much information concerning speech act (question,
command, guess, intention, etc.). In conversational
systems such as qustion answering systems, these
meaning can be used for selecting apropriate reactions.
(2) (type of object] Analysis results of aspect or tense are
used for determining the type of objects.

<bodyText confidence="0.917912">
The subordinate clause of (s23) describes a general
character of &amp;quot;densha (train)&amp;quot;, and the first occurrence of
&amp;quot;densha&amp;quot; denotes a generic object On the other hand,
the second occurrence of &amp;quot;densha&amp;quot; is modified by an
embedded sentence, and &amp;quot;densha&amp;quot; denotes a specific
object which &apos;I saw in a movie yesterday&amp;quot;. Like this, if
the character of the event is analysed by the analysis of
aspect or tense, the character of the objects can be
specified.
(3) [translation] As shown in the translated sentences
in (s23) and (s24), results of the modality analysis are
clearly realized in quality of translated sentences. In
these sentences, modality such as &amp;quot;limitation&amp;quot;,

7. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940055555556">
We proposed an analysis method for Japanese
modality. In this purpose, we classified the meaning of
modality into four categories, and then defined five
modality functions which characterize the role of
modality. By employing logical expressions to
represent the meaning structure, we could effectively
specify the modality function. Though logical
expression has the same expressive power as frames or
semantic networks, a more concise semantic
representation can be realized by this method.
Although we dealt with the modality analysis
restricted within the scope of one sentence in this paper,
we must investigate the effect of discourse information
on the analysis of modality in the future.
We have applied this modality analysis method to
the Japanese sentence analysis in the Japanese-
English experimental machine translation system,
