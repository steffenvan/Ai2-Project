This paper presents our systems for the
participation of Chinese Personal Name
Disambiguation task in the CIPS-
SIGHAN 2010. We submitted two dif-
ferent systems for this task, and both of
them all achieve the best performance.
This paper introduces the multi-stage
clustering framework and some key
techniques used in our systems, and
demonstrates experimental results on
evaluation data. Finally, we further dis-
cuss some interesting issues found dur-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999750727272728">
Personal name disambiguation (PND) is very
important for web search and potentially other
natural language applications such as question
answering. CIPS-SIGHAN bakeoffs provide a
platform to evaluate the effectiveness of various
methods on Chinese PND task.
Different from English PND, word segmenta-
tion techniques are needed for Chinese PND
tasks. In practice, person names are highly am-
biguous because different people may have the
same name, and the same name can be written
in different ways. It’s an n-to-n mapping of per-
son names to the specific people. There are two
main challenges on Chinese PND: the first one
is how to correctly recognize personal names in
the text, and the other is how to distinguish dif-
ferent persons who have the same name. For
address these challenges, we designed a rule-
based combination technique to improve NER
performance and propose a multi-stage cluster-
ing framework for Chinese PND. We partici-
pated in the bakeoff of the Chinese PND task,
on the test set and the diagnosis test set, our two
systems are ranked at the 1st and 2nd position.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we first give the key features and
techniques used in our two systems. In Section
3, experimental results on the evaluation test
data demonstrated that our methods are effec-
tive to disambiguate the personal name, and
discussions on some issues we found during the
development of the system are given. In Section
4, we conclude our work.

2 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996796">
In this section, we describe the framework of
our systems in more detail, involving data pre-
processing, discard-class document identifica-
tion, feature definition, clustering algorithms,
and sub-system combination.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977107">
2.1 Data Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996962">
There are around 100-300 news articles per per-
sonal name in the evaluation corpus. Each arti-
cle is stored in the form of XML and encoded in
UTF-8. At first, each news article should be
preprocessed as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986034428571429">
• Use a publicly available Chinese encoding
Converter tool to convert each news article
from UTF-8 coding into GB1;
• Remove all XML tags;
• Process Chinese word segmentation, part-
of-speech (POS) tagging and name entity
recognition (NER);
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.8990605">
The performance of word segmentation and
NER tools generally affect the effectiveness of
our Chinese PND systems. During system de-

veloping process, we found that the publicly
available NER systems obtain unsatisfactory
performance on evaluation data. To address this
challenge, we propose a new rule-based combi-
nation technique to improve NER performance.
In our combination framework, two different
NER systems are utilized, including a CRF-
based NER system and our laboratory’s NER
system (Yao et al.,2002). The latter was imple-
mented based on the maximum matching prin-
ciple and some linguistic post-preprocessing
rules. Since both two NER systems adopt dif-
ferent technical frameworks, it is possible to
achieve a better performance by means of sys-
tem combination techniques.
The basic idea of our combination method is
to first simply combine the results produced by
both NER systems, and further utilize some
heuristic post-processing rules to refine NE
identification results. To achieve this goal, we
first investigate error types caused by both NER
systems, and design some post-preprocessing
rules to correct errors or select the appropriate
NER results from disagreements. Notice that
such rules are learned from sample data (i.e.,
training set), not from test set. Experimental
results demonstrate satisfactory NER perform-
ance by introducing these heuristic refinement
rules as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999315851851852">
• Conjunction Rules. Two NEs separated
by a conjunction (such as “和”,“或”,“与”,
“、” ) belong to the same type, e.g., “高明
/adj.和/吴倩莲/person”. Such a conjunc-
tion rule can help NER systems make a
consistent prediction on both NEs, e.g., “高
明/person” and “高峰/person”.
• Professional Title Rules. Professional title
words such as “主任” are strong indicators
of person names, e.g., “主任/李刚”. Such a
rule can be written in the form of “profes-
sional_title+person_name”.
• Suffix Rules. If an identified person name
is followed by a suffix of another type of
named entities such as location, it is not a
true person name, for example, “阿萨姆邦
德马杰/person 镇/的/居民”. Since “镇” is
a suffix of a location name. “阿萨姆邦德
马杰/person 镇/location-suffix” should be
revised to be a new location name, namely
“阿萨姆邦德马杰镇/location”.
• Foreign Person Name Rules. Two identi-
fied person names connected by a dot are
merged into a single foreign person name,
e.g., “菲/./罗杰斯” =&gt; “菲.罗杰斯”
• Chinese Surname Rules. Surnames are
very important for Chinese person name
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.917202428571429">
identification. However, some common
surnames can be single words depending
upon the context, for example, the Chinese
word “张” can be either a surname or a
quantifier. To tackle this problem, some
post-processing rules for “张, 段, 高, 刘,
赵” are designed in our system.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992421">
• Query-Dependent Rules. Given a query
person name A, if the string AB occurring
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993295153846154">
in the current document has been identified
as a single person name many times in
other documents, our system would tend to
segment AB as a single person name rather
than as A/B. For example, if “郭伟明” was
identified as a true person name more than
one time in other documents, in such a case,
“议员/郭伟/明/表示/”=&gt; “议员/郭伟明
/person 表示/”
Incorporating these above post-processing
rules, our NER system based on heuristic post-
processing rules shows 98.89% precision of
NER on training set.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998081">
2.2 Discard-Class Document Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883133333334">
Seen from evaluation data, there are a lot of
documents belonging to a specific class, re-
ferred to as discard-class. In the discard-class,
the query person name occurring in the docu-
ment is not a true person name. For example, a
query word “黄海” is a famous ocean name not
a person name in the sentence “三江飘流分别
可达日本海、 黄海和鄂霍茨克海”. In such a
case, the corresponding document is considered
as discard-class. Along this line, actually the
discard-class document identification is very
simple task. If a document does not contain a
true person name that is the same as the query
or contains the query, it is a discard-class
document.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992931">
2.3 Feature Definition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996705">
To identify different types of person name and
for the PND purpose, some effective binary fea-
tures are defined to construct the document rep-
resentation as feature vectors as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9985666">
• Personal attributes: involving profes-
sional title, affiliation, location, co-
occurrence person name and organization
related to the given query.
• NE-type Features: collecting all NEs oc-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.95925325">
curring in the context of the given query.
There are two kinds of NE-type features
used in our systems, local features and
global features. The global features are de-
fined with respect to the whole document
while the local features are extracted only
from the two or three adjacent sentences
for the given query.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.957377">
• BOW-type features: constructing the con-
text feature vector based on bag-of-word
model. Similarly, there are local and global
BOW-type features with respect to the con-
text considered.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992001">
2.4 A Multi-stage Clustering Framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953692307692">
Seen from the training set, 36% of person
names indicate journalists, 10% are sportsmen,
and the remaining are common person names.
Based on such observations, it is necessary to
utilize different methodology to PND on differ-
ent types of person names, for example, because
the most effective information to distinguish
different journalists are the reports’ location and
colleagues, instead of the whole document con-
tent. To achieve a satisfactory PND perform-
ance, in our system we design three different
modules for analyzing journalist, sportsman and
common person name, respectively.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.541685">
2.4.1 PND on the Journalist Class
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980891">
In our system, some regular expressions are
designed to determine whether a person name is
a journalist or not. For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999226833333333">
• 新华社/ni */ns */t */t 消息|电/n (/w .*
[《/w */ni 》/w ]* query name/nh .*)/w
• (/w .*query name/nh .*)/w
• [*/nh]* query name/nh [*/nh]
• 记 t  |编 辑 /n [*/nh]* query name/nh
[*/nh]*
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995745">
To disambiguate on the journalist class, our
system utilizes a rule-based clustering technique
distinguish different journalists. For each
document containing the query person name as
journalists, we first extract the organization and
the location occurring in the local context of the
query. Two such documents can be put into the
same cluster if they contain the same organiza-
tion or location names, otherwise not. In our
system, a location dictionary containing prov-
ince-city information extracted from Wikipedia
is used to identify location name. For example:
辽宁省 (沈阳 大连 铁岭 鞍山 ...), 河北(石家
庄 唐山 秦皇岛 邯郸 邢台...). Based on this
dictionary, it is very easy to map a city to its
corresponding province.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.639463">
2.4.2 PND on the Sportsman Class
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999373235294118">
Like done in PND on the journalist class, we
also use rule-based clustering techniques for
disambiguating sportsman class. The major dif-
ference is to utilize topic features for PND on
the sportsman class. If the topic of the given
document is sports, this document can be con-
sidered as sportsman class. The key is to how to
automatically identify the topic of the document
containing the query. To address this challenge,
we adopt a domain knowledge based technique
for document topic identification. The basic
idea is to utilize a domain knowledge dictionary
NEUKD developed by our lab, which contains
more than 600,000 domain associated terms and
the corresponding domain features. Some do-
main associated terms defined in NEUKD are
shown in Table 1.
</bodyText>

2.4.3 Multi-Stage Clustering Framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990153846154">
We proposed a multi-stage clustering frame-
work for PND on common person name class,
as shown In Figure 1.
In the multi-stage clustering framework, the
first-stage is to adopt strict rule-based hard clus-
tering algorithm using the feature set of per-
sonal attributes. The second-stage is to imple-
ment constrained hierarchical agglomerative
clustering using NE-type local features. The
third-stage is to design hierarchical agglomera-
tive clustering using BOW-type global features.
By combining those above techniques, we sub-
mitted the first system named NEU_1.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.762755">
2.4.4 The second system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.893814">
Besides, we also submitted another PND system
named NEU_2 by using the single-link hierar-
chical agglomerative clustering algorithm in
which the distance of two clusters is the cosine
similarity of their most similar members (Ma-
saki et al., 2009, Duda et al., 2004). The differ-
ence between our two submission systems
NEU_1 and NEU_2 is the feature weighting
method. The motivation of feature weighting
method used in NEU_2 is to assume that words
surrounding the query person name in the given
document are more important features than
those far away from it, and person name and
location names occurring in the context are
more discriminative features than common
words for PND purpose. Along this line, in the
feature weighting scheme used in NEU_2, for
each feature extracted from the sentence con-
taining the query person name, the weight of a
word-type feature with the POS of “ns”, ”ni”
or ”nh ” is assigned as 3, Otherwise 1.5; For
the features extracted from other sentences, the

3.3 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9854724">
We propose a multi-stage clustering framework
for Chinese personal name disambiguation. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the features
and key techniques our systems adopt are effec-
tive. Our systems achieve the best performance
in this competition. However, our recall values
are not unsatisfactory. In such a case, there is
still much room for improvement. Observed
from experimental results, some interesting is-
sues are worth being discussed and addressed in
our future work as follows:
(1) For PND on some personal names, the
document topic information seems not effective.
For example, the personal name &amp;quot; 郭 华 (Guo
Hua)&amp;quot; in training set represent one shooter and
one billiards player. The PND system based on
traditional clustering method can not effectively
work in such a case due to the same sports topic.
To solve this problem, one solution is to suffi-
ciently combine the personal attributes and
document topic information for PND on this
person name.
(2) For the journalist-class personal names,
global BOW-type features are not effective in
this case as different persons can report on the
same or similar events. For example, there are
four different journalists named “朱朱朱(Zhu
Jianjun)” in the training set, involving different
locations such as Beijing, Zhengzhou, Xining or
Guangzhou. We can distinguish them in terms
of the location they are working in.
(3) We found that some documents in the
training set only contain lists of news title and
the news reporter. In this case, we can not dis-
criminate the persons with respect to the loca-
tion of entire news. It’s worth studying some
effective solution to address this challenge in
our future work.
(4) Seen from the experimental results, some
personal names such as “李刚(Li gang)” are
wrong identified because this person is associ-
ated with multiple professional titles and affili-
ates. In this case, the use of exact matching
methods can not yield satisfactory results. For
example, the query name “李刚(Li gang)” in
the documents 274 and 275 is the president of
“中国对外文刖交流协会(China International
Culture Association)” while in the documents
202, 225 and 228, he is the director of “文刖部
对外文刖联络局(Bureau of External Cultural
Relations of Chinese Ministry of Culture)”. To
group both cases into the same cluster, it’s
worth mining the relations and underlying se-
mantic relations between entities to achieve this
goal.
