<bodyText confidence="0.999906470588235">
The evolution of competing lexical categories
is simulated within a model in which lexical
outputs are organized as sequences of
articulatory gestures. When exemplar-based
categories compete for assignment and storage
of incoming exemplars in a production/storage
loop, contrast between categories
spontaneously emerges and remains stable,
driven by the differences in storage
consistency between more contrastive and less
contrastive variants. Further, when lexical
outputs are biased toward use of previously
produced gestures, the set of exemplars in the
lexicon evolve to be derived from a small set
of contrastive units used in combination,
despite the absence of direct selection for
contrast at the sub-lexical level.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999958922077923">
The probability of accurate information
transmission is dependent on the perceptibility of
difference between differently signifying forms,
that is, contrast. The possible mechanisms by
which contrast arises and is preserved in lexical
forms, on the other hand, have been less clear.
Many grammatical theories of the last century
assume that the language faculty is constituted to
directly optimize contrast in some way, e.g.,
(Martinet 1955), (Flemming 1995), and much
computational work also operates within the
assumption that contrast between units of form is
maintained through some kind of direct monitoring
and manipulation of contrast, e.g., (Lindblom
1986), (de Boer 2000). In all of these approaches,
contrast is a property of forms. Here, I will present
evidence within an exemplar model of lexical
production and perception (Goldinger 2000),
(Pierrehumbert 2001) that the fact of a distinction
between categories themselves, rather than the
forms that instantiate them, can be indirectly
responsible for driving contrast preservation
through the statistics of assignment of forms to
categories.
Within exemplar models of linguistic category
structure, the act of categorizing a percept does not
strip that percept of all non-contrastive detail, e.g.,
(Johnson 1997), (Pierrehumbert 2001). When we
take into account evidence that production of an
output of a lexical category may be based on
details of previously perceived instances of that
category (Goldinger 2000), we see that a
production-perception feedback loop is closed, in
which details in what is perceived can be
subsequently reflected in the details of what is
produced (Pierrehumbert 2001), (Oudeyer 2002).
Whenever a system exhibits variation among
elements, selection of variants over some criterion,
and subsequent reproduction of selected elements,
the system will evolve through natural selection on
the basis of that criterion. Hence, any factors
within the production-perception loop that bias the
distribution of forms that are produced, the
distribution of forms that are perceived, or the way
that percepts are categorized, will result in
evolution of category contents. Within the model
presented here, lexical categories are populated by
exemplars that have been previously categorized as
correspondents of that category, and the output of a
given category follows a distribution defined in
part by the range of exemplars of that category,
e.g., (Goldinger 2000), (Pierrehumbert 2001,
2002). Outputs are recognized as correspondents of
a given category by comparison to exemplars
already stored within that category (Pierrehumbert
2001); see also (Luce and Pisoni, 1998). Because
outputs of a category can be re-stored as new
exemplars within that category within a
community of speakers, any asymmetries in either
the form of outputs, or the likelihood of
recognition and storage of those outputs, will result
in a shift in the contents of that category over time
(Pierrehumbert 2001), (Oudeyer 2002), and
(Wedel 2004).
Here, I show simulation results suggesting that
contrast between distinct form-meaning pairings
can arise indirectly from asymmetries in the
consistency of categorization of more contrastive,
versus less contrastive outputs1. Because more
contrastive outputs make up a relatively greater
proportion of the regularly stored exemplars in a
given category than less contrastive outputs, they
should have a proportionally greater influence on
the evolution of that category. This asymmetry in
the statistics of recognition and storage results in
biased evolution of categories towards greater
contrast.

1.1 Contrast preservation through
categorization in morphology.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954038461538">
Within linguistics, the notion that contrast
maintenance is an indirect effect of contrast’s
effect on a hearer/acquirer’s categorization
behavior has been suggested by Pierrehumbert
(2002), and by Gregory Guy (1996) on the basis of
corpus data on preservation of morphological
contrasts. Guy notes that data from production
corpora will always underestimate the true extent
of speakers’ failure to produce a given meaningful
contrast. For example, if a transcriber perceives the
utterance ‘I cook the chicken’, in the absence of
additional information s/he is likely to simply
transcribe it as such, even if the speaker actually
intended the sentence to be in past tense, but elided
the [-t] past tense marker. Guy notes that language
acquirers are no different from transcribers, such
that the perception data from which a language
learner develops a grammar will be biased towards
the more contrastive utterances in the production
data set. This steady selection of more contrastive
forms in the categorized utterance set upon which
acquisition is based should result in a tendency for
grammatical processes to emerge that appear to
function to preserve contrast, when they in fact
only act to reproduce the patterns in the data set
that the acquirer perceives.

1.2 Contrast maintenance as a form of niche
specialization.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991554557142857">
This mechanism for category separation through
competition for category members is formally
parallel to a proposed mechanism of sympatric
speciation first proposed by Darwin (1859, chap.
4) and further developed in recent theoretical
research on the effects of resource competition on
the distribution of phenotypes in a population
(Kondrashov and Kondrashov 1999), (Dieckmann
and Doebeli 1999 and references therein). In this
model of sympatric speciation (speciation in the
absence of geographical separation), phenotypic

result of lexical access is a unique output-category
match, e.g., (Luce and Pisoni 1998).
divisions within a population and subsequent
speciation can be driven by inequalities in the
degree of competition experienced by individuals
lying at different points on a distribution of
phenotypes relating to resource exploitation.
Individuals exhibiting intermediate phenotypes
compete against a larger fraction of the population,
while more extreme phenotypes have fewer
competitors, and therefore greater individual
access to resources. The higher fitness of
individuals lying at the extremes of a phenotypic
distribution can eventually produce a split in the
population along this phenotypic dimension,
setting the stage for subsequent speciation.
The same statistical influence of resource
competition on fitness has also been proposed to
drive ‘niche specialization’ among separate species
occupying overlapping niches (Schoener 1974),
(Dieckmann and Doebeli 1999). For example, if
two species that utilize an overlapping set of
resources jointly colonize a new environment, they
tend to evolve to specialize on different portions of
the resource distribution. This is proposed to occur
because phenotypic variants of each species that
happen to focus on an extreme of the resource
distribution experience less competition than those
who prefer the center of the distribution.
Within the exemplar based model proposed here
for contrast maintenance, lexical categories are
formally parallel to competing species undergoing
selection for niche specialization. A category will
be less often matched with a percept that is also
close to another category than a percept that is
close to no other category. Further, because the
matching behavior of a category is determined by
its contents, a category will evolve to be more
specific for those percepts most often identified as
members of that category. In this way, categories
will tend to evolve to split the available percept
space evenly, minimizing regions of overlap (see
(Pierrehumbert 2002) for additional discussion of
overlap minimization in evolving exemplar-based
categories).
2 Modeling contrast maintenance through
category competition.
To provide a simple illustration of the
phenomenon of category boundary maintenance
through patterns of category assignment, I show
below results of a simple simulation of two
interacting categories. Each category contains ten
numerical ‘exemplars’ that can vary in value
within a range from zero to ten. In each round,
each category produces all of its exemplars one by
one. Noise is introduced in production by adding to
each output a random value between +/-0.4;
increasing the amount of noise in outputs increases

When category competition is reintroduced,
however, something quite different happens:
although target values still show significant
consolidation over the course of the simulation,
sufficient distinctions remain to preserve contrast
between lexical categories. Figure 3A shows the

In Figure 3B, equivalent ‘segments’ are shaded
equivalently. Each lexical category is distinct from
every other. In runs with larger numbers of lexical
categories, two Y target values often develop as
well, assorting with two or more X target values to
provide sufficient numbers of contrastive units (not
shown).
Note that this effect is not dependent on less
contrastive variants being less often stored. In the
numerical simulations described above in section
2, every output was stored in a category. In the
simulations described in this section, every variant
form was stored in some category, provided it
could be matched to at least one exemplar. A
variant lying between two categories has then in
fact a greater chance of being matched and stored
than a variant that lies an equivalent distance away
from a single category, even though the latter is
functionally more contrastive. This generous
assignment and storage procedure was chosen to
make it less likely that the development and
maintenance of contrast within the simulations
could be due to differential rates of storage, as
opposed to differential consistency of storage.
Previous work (Wedel 2004) showed that in
similar simulations in which outputs matching
multiple categories were at a disadvantage in
storage efficiency relative to those matching just
one category, development and maintenance of
contrast was yet more robust than in the
simulations shown here. Phenomena such as the
neighborhood density effect in lexical access
indicate that outputs activating multiple lexical
categories may in fact be at a disadvantage in

form, they never split and regain contrast. This
appears to be largely true for actual lexical
categories as well (but see e.g., (Yaeger-Dror
1996) and (Jurafsky et al. 1996) for evidence that
homophonous categories may be able to split under

<bodyText confidence="0.999991654135339">
The simulation results described here illustrate
that competition between categories for form
variants in a production/storage loop indirectly
supports maintenance of contrast across form-
category pairs. As suggested by (Guy 1996) and
(Pierrehumbert 2002) in linguistics, and by
theoretical work in niche specialization in
evolutionary biology (Schoener 1974),
(Deickmann and Doebeli 1997), this phenomenon
rests on unequal partitioning of variants across
self-reproducing categories: those variants that are
split among multiple categories contribute less to
the evolving form of any given category than those
variants that are more consistently stored, with the
result that the lexicon evolves to reflect the more
contrastive variants.
Is this a potential mechanism contributing to
contrast maintenance at the sub-morphemic level?
In support of this possibility, speakers have been
shown to produce more contrastive phonetic detail
when producing words in high-density lexical
neighborhoods, e.g., (Goldinger and Summers
1989), (Wright 1996), and (Brown 2002), which
could be a reflection of the distribution of phonetic
details stored in the lexical categories in high
density neighborhoods.
The structure of exemplars in the simulations in
section 3 reflect the fact that lexical forms consist
of multiple, temporally ordered articulatory
gestures. This structure allows, but does not
dictate, the development of a combinatorial system
in which simulated gestures or gestural groupings
are reused in distinct lexical forms. However,
evidence strongly suggests that practice of
coordinated muscular gestures results in
consolidation into larger-scale motor programs,
which then serve as attractors in motor planning
and execution (Shadmehr and Bashers-Krug 1997
and references therein). To simulate this effect, in
output assembly target values and larger groupings
of target values were warped towards those values
that had been frequently produced in the speaker’s
recent history. The resulting tendency to minimize
target value differences conflicts with the statistical
reward enjoyed by more contrastive forms,
resulting in a optimization in which lexical entries
evolve to contain contrastive exemplars, which are
themselves composed of a small number of
contrastive units. Rather than being stipulated
anywhere in the system, the contrastiveness of
these sub-lexical units evolves indirectly through
competition between the actual form-category
pairs that contain them. Interestingly, as we saw in
the simulations described in conjunction with
Figures 4A and B, the tight association of target
values as ‘motor units’ allows a functionally
unnecessary contrast to persist in a given lexical
category, if that contrast is functionally required in
another.
The potential influence of contrast on sound
change suggested by these results is supported by
at least two well-described phonological patterns.
First, certain exceptions to otherwise regular sound
change, sometimes referred to as &apos;anti-homophony
effects&apos;, occur precisely where sound change would
give rise to loss of a paradigmatic contrast. In this
case, data from unrelated languages supports a
cross-linguistic tendency for contrastive exemplars
to be preferred exactly where lexical categories are
in greatest competition (Blevins to appear), and
(Gessner &amp; Hansson 2004). A second finding is
that rare phonological contrasts (e.g., a three-way
contrast in vowel or consonant length, or a three-
way contrast in nasalization) are not randomly
distributed in the lexicon. Rather in languages
making use of rare contrasts, these contrasts are
frequently the exponents of contrastive
morphological features, and hence are only
contrastive in contexts of lexical competition
(Blevins 2004, chapter 8). The simulations
presented here can account for both these findings
in terms of contrast-driven statistical selection of
exemplars at category extremes. In the case of
antigemination, this selection inhibits the
progression of a sound change in limited contexts
where morphemes compete. In the case of rare
contrasts, selection inhibits expected mergers in
limited contexts where that contrast is the sole
exponent of contrast.
Finally, the results of these simulations
contribute to an ongoing discussion of the
divergent relationship between lexical frequency
and morphological, versus phonological
‘regularity’ (see e.g., Pierrehumbert 2002). The
well-known tendency to morphological irregularity
in high-frequency forms can be explained as an
effect of frequency on lexical access: the higher
resting activation level of frequent forms should
allow them to be identified holistically, rather than
through identification of their individually
contrastive morphemes. Similarly then, we might
expect that highly frequent words should be able to
evolve to be phonologically exceptional, for
example by resisting a sound change sweeping
through the rest of the lexicon, or developing an
otherwise unattested phone. However, in general
we find just the opposite: highly frequent forms do
conform to sound changes initiated elsewhere, tend
to be the most lenited, and tend as well to comprise
more common sounds (see Bybee (2002) and
Pierrehumbert (2002) for discussion). This can be
explained within a model in which phonological,
but not morphological categories tend to be
coextensive with motor units, if we assume a
tendency toward effort minimization in production.
Ceteris paribus, highly practiced motor scores are
deployed more rapidly and accurately than less
practiced motor scores (Shadmehr and Bashers-
Krug 1997 and references therein), and so we can
consider lexical evolution toward use of more
common motor scores a form of lenition, defined
with respect to the particular language use of
speakers in a speech community. If a sound change
sweeps through most of a lexicon altering a motor
score into another, highly frequent forms might
also be expected to shift away from the original,
now infrequent motor score to the new highly
frequent one, not because they must, but because
their high frequency encourages lenition (reviewed
in Bybee 2001). Preliminary simulation results
exploring the interaction of exemplar frequency
and warping toward frequent target values support
this hypothesis.

Is this a potential mechanism contributing to contrast maintenance at the sub-morphemic level? In support of this possibility, speakers have been shown to produce more contrastive phonetic detail when producing words in high-density lexical neighborhoods, e.g., (Goldinger and Summers 1989), (Wright 1996), and (Brown 2002), which could be a reflection of the distribution of phonetic details stored in the lexical categories in high density neighborhoods.

Similarly then, we might expect that highly frequent words should be able to evolve to be phonologically exceptional, for example by resisting a sound change sweeping through the rest of the lexicon, or developing an otherwise unattested phone. However, in general we find just the opposite: highly frequent forms do conform to sound changes initiated elsewhere, tend to be the most lenited, and tend as well to comprise more common sounds (see Bybee (2002) and Pierrehumbert (2002) for discussion). This can be explained within a model in which phonological, but not morphological categories tend to be coextensive with motor units, if we assume a tendency toward effort minimization in production. Ceteris paribus, highly practiced motor scores are deployed more rapidly and accurately than less practiced motor scores (Shadmehr and BashersKrug 1997 and references therein), and so we can consider lexical evolution toward use of more common motor scores a form of lenition, defined with respect to the particular language use of speakers in a speech comm</context>

The potential influence of contrast on sound change suggested by these results is supported by at least two well-described phonological patterns. First, certain exceptions to otherwise regular sound change, sometimes referred to as &apos;anti-homophony effects&apos;, occur precisely where sound change would give rise to loss of a paradigmatic contrast. In this case, data from unrelated languages supports a cross-linguistic tendency for contrastive exemplars to be preferred exactly where lexical categories are in greatest competition (Blevins to appear), and (Gessner &amp; Hansson 2004). A second finding is that rare phonological contrasts (e.g., a three-way contrast in vowel or consonant length, or a threeway contrast in nasalization) are not randomly distributed in the lexicon. Rather in languages making use of rare contrasts, these contrasts are frequently the exponents of contrastive morphological features, and hence are only contrastive in contexts of lexical competition (Blevins 2004, chapter 8). The simulations presented here can account for both these findings in terms of contrast-driven statistical selection of exemplars at category extremes. In the case of antigemi</context>

This asymmetry in the statistics of recognition and storage results in biased evolution of categories towards greater contrast. 1.1 Contrast preservation through categorization in morphology. Within linguistics, the notion that contrast maintenance is an indirect effect of contrast’s effect on a hearer/acquirer’s categorization behavior has been suggested by Pierrehumbert (2002), and by Gregory Guy (1996) on the basis of corpus data on preservation of morphological contrasts. Guy notes that data from production corpora will always underestimate the true extent of speakers’ failure to produce a given meaningful contrast. For example, if a transcriber perceives the utterance ‘I cook the chicken’, in the absence of additional information s/he is likely to simply transcribe it as such, even if the speaker actually intended the sentence to be in past tense, but elided the [-t] past tense marker. Guy notes that language acquirers are no different from transcribers, such that the perception data from</context>

This appears to be largely true for actual lexical categories as well (but see e.g., (Yaeger-Dror 1996) and (Jurafsky et al. 1996) for evidence that homophonous categories may be able to split under some circumstances). 4 Discussion The simulation results described here illustrate that competition between categories for form variants in a production/storage loop indirectly supports maintenance of contrast across formcategory pairs. As suggested by (Guy 1996) and (Pierrehumbert 2002) in linguistics, and by theoretical work in niche specialization in evolutionary biology (Schoener 1974), (Deickmann and Doebeli 1997), this phenomenon rests on unequal partitioning of variants across self-reproducing categories: those variants that are split among multiple categories contribute less to the evolving form of any given category than those variants that are more consistently stored, with the result that the lexicon evolves to reflect the more contrastive variants.

Within exemplar models of linguistic category structure, the act of categorizing a percept does not strip that percept of all non-contrastive detail, e.g., (Johnson 1997), (Pierrehumbert 2001). When we take into account evidence that production of an output of a lexical category may be based on details of previously perceived instances of that category (Goldinger 2000), we see that a production-perception feedback loop is closed, in which details in what is perceived can be subsequently reflected in the details of what is produced (Pierrehumbert 2001), (Oudeyer 2002). Whenever a system exhibits variation among elements, selection of variants over some criterion, and subsequent reproduction of selected elements, the system will evolve through natural selection on the basis of that criterion. Hence, any factors within the production-perception loop that bias the distribution of forms that are produced, the distribution of forms that are perceived, or the way that percepts are categorized, will result in evolution of category contents.

Many grammatical theories of the last century assume that the language faculty is constituted to directly optimize contrast in some way, e.g., (Martinet 1955), (Flemming 1995), and much computational work also operates within the assumption that contrast between units of form is maintained through some kind of direct monitoring and manipulation of contrast, e.g., (Lindblom 1986), (de Boer 2000). In all of these approaches, contrast is a property of forms. Here, I will present evidence within an exemplar model of lexical production and perception (Goldinger 2000), (Pierrehumbert 2001) that the fact of a distinction between categories themselves, rather than the forms that instantiate them, can be indirectly responsible for driving contrast preservation through the statistics of assignment of forms to categories. Within exemplar models of linguistic category structure, the act of categorizing a percept does not strip that percept of all non-contrastive detail, e.g., (Johnson 1997), (Pierrehumbert 2001).

Within the model presented here, lexical categories are populated by exemplars that have been previously categorized as correspondents of that category, and the output of a given category follows a distribution defined in part by the range of exemplars of that category, e.g., (Goldinger 2000), (Pierrehumbert 2001, 2002).

This asymmetry in the statistics of recognition and storage results in biased evolution of categories towards greater contrast. 1.1 Contrast preservation through categorization in morphology. Within linguistics, the notion that contrast maintenance is an indirect effect of contrast’s effect on a hearer/acquirer’s categorization behavior has been suggested by Pierrehumbert (2002), and by Gregory Guy (1996) on the basis of corpus data on preservation of morphological contrasts. Guy notes that data from production corpora will always underestimate the true extent of speakers’ failure to produce a given meaningful contrast. For example, if a transcriber perceives the utterance ‘I cook the chicken’, in the absence of additional information s/he is likely to simply transcribe it as such, even if the speaker actually intended the sentence to be in past tense, but elided the [-t] past tense marker. Guy notes that language acquirers are no different from transcribers, such th</context>

A category will be less often matched with a percept that is also close to another category than a percept that is close to no other category. Further, because the matching behavior of a category is determined by its contents, a category will evolve to be more specific for those percepts most often identified as members of that category. In this way, categories will tend to evolve to split the available percept space evenly, minimizing regions of overlap (see (Pierrehumbert 2002) for additional discussion of overlap minimization in evolving exemplar-based categories). 2 Modeling contrast maintenance through category competition. To provide a simple illustration of the phenomenon of category boundary maintenance through patterns of category assignment, I show below results of a simple simulation of two interacting categories. Each category contains ten numerical ‘exemplars’ that can vary in value within a range from zero to ten. In each round, each category produces all of its exemplars one by one. Noise is introduced in production by adding to each output a random val</context>

This appears to be largely true for actual lexical categories as well (but see e.g., (Yaeger-Dror 1996) and (Jurafsky et al. 1996) for evidence that homophonous categories may be able to split under some circumstances). 4 Discussion The simulation results described here illustrate that competition between categories for form variants in a production/storage loop indirectly supports maintenance of contrast across formcategory pairs. As suggested by (Guy 1996) and (Pierrehumbert 2002) in linguistics, and by theoretical work in niche specialization in evolutionary biology (Schoener 1974), (Deickmann and Doebeli 1997), this phenomenon rests on unequal partitioning of variants across self-reproducing categories: those variants that are split among multiple categories contribute less to the evolving form of any given category than those variants that are more consistently stored, with the result that the lexicon evolves to reflect the more contrastive variants. Is this a potential mechanism contributing to contrast maintenance at the sub-morphemic level? In support of this pos</context>

In the case of antigemination, this selection inhibits the progression of a sound change in limited contexts where morphemes compete. In the case of rare contrasts, selection inhibits expected mergers in limited contexts where that contrast is the sole exponent of contrast. Finally, the results of these simulations contribute to an ongoing discussion of the divergent relationship between lexical frequency and morphological, versus phonological ‘regularity’ (see e.g., Pierrehumbert 2002). The well-known tendency to morphological irregularity in high-frequency forms can be explained as an effect of frequency on lexical access: the higher resting activation level of frequent forms should allow them to be identified holistically, rather than through identification of their individually contrastive morphemes. Similarly then, we might expect that highly frequent words should be able to evolve to be phonologically exceptional, for example by resisting a sound change sweeping through the rest of the lexicon, or developing an otherwise unattested phone. However, in general we find ju</context>

The structure of exemplars in the simulations in section 3 reflect the fact that lexical forms consist of multiple, temporally ordered articulatory gestures. This structure allows, but does not dictate, the development of a combinatorial system in which simulated gestures or gestural groupings are reused in distinct lexical forms. However, evidence strongly suggests that practice of coordinated muscular gestures results in consolidation into larger-scale motor programs, which then serve as attractors in motor planning and execution (Shadmehr and Bashers-Krug 1997 and references therein). To simulate this effect, in output assembly target values and larger groupings of target values were warped towards those values that had been frequently produced in the speaker’s recent history. The resulting tendency to minimize target value differences conflicts with the statistical reward enjoyed by more contrastive forms, resulting in a optimization in which lexical entries evolve to contain contrastive exemplars, which are themselves composed of a small number of contrastive units. Rather than being stipulated anywhere in the system, the contrastiveness of these</context>

Individuals exhibiting intermediate phenotypes compete against a larger fraction of the population, while more extreme phenotypes have fewer competitors, and therefore greater individual access to resources. The higher fitness of individuals lying at the extremes of a phenotypic distribution can eventually produce a split in the population along this phenotypic dimension, setting the stage for subsequent speciation. The same statistical influence of resource competition on fitness has also been proposed to drive ‘niche specialization’ among separate species occupying overlapping niches (Schoener 1974), (Dieckmann and Doebeli 1999). For example, if two species that utilize an overlapping set of resources jointly colonize a new environment, they tend to evolve to specialize on different portions of the resource distribution. This is proposed to occur because phenotypic variants of each species that happen to focus on an extreme of the resource distribution experience less competition than those who prefer the center of the distribution.

A variant lying between two categories has then in fact a greater chance of being matched and stored than a variant that lies an equivalent distance away from a single category, even though the latter is functionally more contrastive. This generous assignment and storage procedure was chosen to make it less likely that the development and maintenance of contrast within the simulations could be due to differential rates of storage, as opposed to differential consistency of storage. Previous work (Wedel 2004) showed that in similar simulations in which outputs matching multiple categories were at a disadvantage in storage efficiency relative to those matching just one category, development and maintenance of contrast was yet more robust than in the simulations shown here.
