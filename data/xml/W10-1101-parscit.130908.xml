MedEval is a Swedish medical test collection
where assessments have been made, not only
for topical relevance, but also for target reader
group: Doctors or Patients. The user of the
test collection can choose if s/he wishes to
search in the Doctors or the Patients scenar-
ios where the topical relevance assessments
have been adjusted with consideration to user
group, or to search in a scenario which regards
only topical relevance. MedEval makes it pos-
sible to compare the effectiveness of search
terms when it comes to retrieving documents
aimed at the different user groups. MedEval is
also the first medical Swedish test collection.

1 A New Test Collection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888928571428">
When the decision was made to build a new test col-
lection, the Department of Swedish at the Univer-
sity of Gothenburg was involved in projects of re-
search in medical language processing. There was
also a growing interest of research in information re-
trieval. There existed no Swedish medical test col-
lection. Creating one seemed to be a good invest-
ment in knowledge and resources, even though this
involved a team of people during many months. As
building a test collection is a major undertaking not
many exist. OHSUMED is a medical test collection,
albeit in English. It is built on nearly 350 000 refer-
ences from MEDLINE. The OHSUMED documents
are assessed on a three graded scale: definitely, pos-
sibly and not relevant. OHSUMED contains 106
topics generated by physicians from authentic situa-
tions. The topics consist of both information about
the patient and the request. (OHSUMED, 2007)
With a new collection such as MedEval, the
Swedish department could take control over the ar-
chitecture and make decisions such as using a four
graded scale of relevance, making it possible to em-
ploy a variety of evaluation tools. However, the
most important decision was to assess documents,
not only for relevance to topics, but also for intended
groups of readers, ‘Doctors: medical professionals’
or ‘Patients: lay persons’, and to allow the user to
choose user scenario: None, Doctors or Patients.

<bodyText confidence="0.99977">
The MedEval test collection is built on docu-
ments from the MedLex medical corpus (Kokki-
nakis, 2004). MedLex consists of scientific arti-
cles from medical journals, teaching material, guide-
lines, patient FAQs, health care information, etc.
The set of documents used in MedEval is a snapshot
of MedLex in October 2007, approximately 42 200
documents or 15 million tokens (see table 1). The
documents are stored in the trectext format.

3 Indexes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995342888888889">
The MedEval test collection has two indexes. One
where the documents are converted to lower case,
tokenized and lemmatized, and one where the com-
pounds also are decomposed. In the second index,
the compound terms are indexed as a whole together
with the compound constituents. For instance: the
compound saltkoncentration ‘salt concentration’ is
indexed as saltkoncentration, salt, and koncentra-
tion.

4 Topics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979347666666667">
Two medical students in their fourth year of studies
were hired to create the topics. Their instructions
were to create information needs that could be re-
quested in real medical situations. 100 topics were
created in the first stage. 62 of these were used in
the collection.
A topic consists of a title, a description and a nar-
rative. The title is a short phrase summarizing the in-
formation need. The description is concise informa-
tion about the topic, usually in the form of a question
or a request. The narrative is a few sentences long
and it stipulates what makes a document relevant to
the topic. The narrative contains the guidelines for
the assessors when judging the relevance of the doc-
uments in the next stage. An example of a topic is
given below. The English equivalent of the descrip-
tion of topic 51 is: Why can a patient with cancer
contract anemia?

5 Selecting Documents to Assess
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982611111111">
In the ideal test collection every document would be
assessed for relevance with respect to every topic.
But with over 42 000 documents and 62 topics, tak-
ing 8 minutes to assess each document, it would take
four persons more than 40 years working 40 hours
per week to finish the assessments.
Instead, only the documents that were considered
most likely to be relevant to each topic were as-
sessed. The documents were filtered out by use of
four queries, one specific and one exhaustive for
each index. The documents selected for each topic
were sorted by document ID and duplicates were re-
moved. This was done so that the assessors would
not know how high a document had been ranked,
or in how many searches it had been retrieved. For
each topic and each of the four queries the 100 high-
est ranked documents were selected, if, in fact, there
were that many.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.991839" genericHeader="method">
6 Relevance Judgments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999869538461539">
For the relevance judgments four new medical stu-
dents were consulted. For each of 62 topics, an as-
sessor read through the documents to be assessed
and decided, for each document, the intended group
of readers and the degree of relevance to the topic.
The documents for each individual need were as-
sessed by one and the same assessor for reasons of
consistency.
The MedEval relevance assessments were made
on a four graded scale, 0-3, where 0 is ‘Not at all
relevant’ and 3 is ‘Highly relevant’. The scale is
easily turned into a binary scale by stating that the
documents with the lower grades are to be consid-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999711">
ered non-relevant and the ones with higher grades
relevant. Where the division is made between rel-
evant and non-relevant depends on the needs of the
user in each case.
The relevance considered by the assessors was
topical relevance, how well a document corresponds
to a topic. The assessors were instructed not to in-
volve user relevance in this score. Each document
was judged on its own merits. The novelty of the
contents of a document should not be considered.

7 Target Groups
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999842371794872">
In addition to topical relevance the assessors judged
each document for reader target group, that is which
group of readers was the intended: Patients, if a doc-
ument was written for lay persons, or Doctors, if it
was written for medical professionals.
For a classification of documents according to
intended reader group to be useful, there must be
a measureable difference between the document
classes. Table 2 shows a number of type/token fre-
quencies in different subsets of the collection. In
each set duplicates were removed in the case that
a document had been assessed for more than one
topic. The subsets considered are described below.
Full form types are the original terms of the doc-
uments before lemmatization and lemma types are
the same terms after lemmatization.
Entire collection All documents of the MedEval
collection.
Assessed documents All documents that have been
assessed for any topic.
Doctors assessed All documents that for at least
one topic have been assessed to have target
group Doctors.
Patients assessed All documents that for at least
one topic have been assessed to have target
group Patients.
Common files All documents that for at least one
topic have been assessed to have target group
Doctors and for another to have target group
Patients.
Doctors relevant All documents that for at least
one topic have been assessed to have at least
relevance grade 1 and to have target group Doc-
tors.
Patients relevant All documents that for at least
one topic have been assessed to have at least
relevance grade 1 and to have target group Pa-
tients.
Before counting frequencies, the files were
cleaned from tags, IDs, dates (in the date tag, not
in the actual text), web information and punctua-
tion marks. Some observations are readily made by
studying table 2.
The number of tokens per document is signifi-
cantly smaller for the entire collection, than for any
subset. This means that there is a large number
of short documents that were not retrieved by any
query when the documents to be assessed were se-
lected. Maybe not surprising, since short documents
contain few terms which can match the queries.
The documents in the set ‘Patients assessed’ had
only 57% the number of tokens per document, com-
pared to the documents in ‘Doctors assessed’. Even
though there were over 1 000 more documents in
‘Patients assessed’ than in ‘Doctors assessed’, there
were over 50 000 more lemma types in the doctor
documents and almost 30 000 more lemma com-
pound types. The average word length in ‘Doctors
assessed’ was 6.29 compared to 5.73 for ‘Patients
assessed’. The ratio of compound tokens was also
higher in the doctor documents, 0.128 compared to
0.098.
Table 3 illustrates the fact that the doctor docu-
ments contain more and longer terms and more com-
pounds than patient documents. This table shows
frequencies of all full form types of strings be-
ginning with f¨ormak ‘atria’ in ‘Patients assessed’
and ‘Doctors assessed’ respectively. The patient
documents have 18 full form types beginning with
f¨ormak while doctor documents have 75. That is
more than four times more types for the doctor doc-
uments.
A closer look at the frequencies off¨ormak∗ in the
professional and lay person texts reveals that not all
frequencies are higher for professionals. The fre-
quencies of nouns in the definite form in the lay per-
son texts are close to, equal or higher than the same
forms in the professional texts.

Looking at all instances of strings beginning with
f¨ormak∗ in the two sets of documents there is a sig-
nificant difference. In the patient documents 66 to-
kens of 372, or 17.7%, are nouns in the definite
form, while the corresponding numbers for the doc-
tor documents is 89 of 932 tokens, or 9.6%. At this
stage one can only speculate why this is so. A hy-
pothesis is that doctors/medical professionals often
discuss matters in a generic point of view, while pa-
tients/lay persons discuss specific cases.

8 User Groups
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99975130952381">
The MedEval test collection allows the user to state
user group: None (no specified group), Doctors or
Patients. This choice directs the user to one of three
scenarios. The None scenario contains the topical
relevance grades as made by the assessors. The Doc-
tors scenario contains the same grades with the ex-
ception that the grades of the documents marked for
Patients target group are downgraded by one. In
the same way the Patients scenario has the docu-
ments marked for Doctors target group downgraded
by one. This means that for a doctor user patient
documents originally given relevance 3, are graded
with 2, documents given relevance 2 are graded 1
and documents given relevance 1 are graded 0. The
same is done in the Patients scenario with the doc-
tor documents. The idea is that a document that is
written for a reader from one target group but re-
trieved for a user from the other group will not be
non-relevant, but less useful than a document from
the correct target group. Put differently, a docu-
ment intended for patients would contain informa-
tion that doctors (hopefully) already know. On the
other hand, documents intended for doctors, even
though they might be topically relevant for a pa-
tient’s need, run a great risk of being written in such
a way that a patient will have problems grasping the
whole content.
Adjusting relevance in the manner described af-
fects the scenario recall bases. Since relevance
grades are downgraded for documents of the oppos-
ing target group there will be fewer relevant docu-
ments in the Doctors and Patients scenarios than in
the None scenario. This is demonstrated in figure 1
where the ideal cumulated gain for the three scenar-
ios of topics 28, 36 and 92 are shown. The ideal cu-
mulated gain is the maximum score of retrieved in-
formation possible at each position in a ranked list of
documents (J¨arvelin, Kek¨al¨ainen, 2002). The score
for each position is the sum of all relevance scores
so far in the ranked list.
The three topics of figure 1 show different char-
acteristics with reference to the number of relevant

To demonstrate the effectiveness of search terms
from the different styles of language of the two tar-

In the Doctors scenario the difference between

This paper shows a few aspects of medical informa-
tion retrieval which can be studied with the use of
the MedEval test collection. The main novelty of the
collection is the marking of document target groups,
Doctors and Patients, together with with the possi-

<abstract confidence="0.998390158730159">MedEval is a Swedish medical test collection where assessments have been made, not only for topical relevance, but also for target reader group: Doctors or Patients. The user of the test collection can choose if s/he wishes to search in the Doctors or the Patients scenarios where the topical relevance assessments have been adjusted with consideration to user group, or to search in a scenario which regards only topical relevance. MedEval makes it possible to compare the effectiveness of search terms when it comes to retrieving documents aimed at the different user groups. MedEval is also the first medical Swedish test collection. 1 A New Test Collection When the decision was made to build a new test collection, the Department of Swedish at the University of Gothenburg was involved in projects of research in medical language processing. There was also a growing interest of research in information retrieval. There existed no Swedish medical test collection. Creating one seemed to be a good investment in knowledge and resources, even though this involved a team of people during many months. As building a test collection is a major undertaking not many exist. OHSUMED is a medical test collection, albeit in English. It is built on nearly 350 000 references from MEDLINE. The OHSUMED documents are assessed on a three graded scale: definitely, possibly and not relevant. OHSUMED contains 106 topics generated by physicians from authentic situations. The topics consist of both information about the patient and the request. (OHSUMED, 2007) With a new collection such as MedEval, the Swedish department could take control over the architecture and make decisions such as using a four graded scale of relevance, making it possible to employ a variety of evaluation tools. However, the most important decision was to assess documents, not only for relevance to topics, but also for intended groups of readers, ‘Doctors: medical professionals’ or ‘Patients: lay persons’, and to allow the user to choose user scenario: None, Doctors or Patients. 2 Documents The MedEval test collection is built on documents from the MedLex medical corpus (Kokkinakis, 2004). MedLex consists of scientific articles from medical journals, teaching material, guidelines, patient FAQs, health care information, etc. The set of documents used in MedEval is a snapshot of MedLex in October 2007, approximately 42 200 documents or 15 million tokens (see table 1). The documents are stored in the trectext format. 3 Indexes The MedEval test collection has two indexes. One where the documents are converted to lower case, tokenized and lemmatized, and one where the compounds also are decomposed. In the second index, the compound terms are indexed as a whole together with the compound constituents. For instance: the concentration’ is as and koncentra-</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.994262201298702">4 Topics Two medical students in their fourth year of studies were hired to create the topics. Their instructions were to create information needs that could be requested in real medical situations. 100 topics were created in the first stage. 62 of these were used in the collection. A topic consists of a title, a description and a narrative. The title is a short phrase summarizing the information need. The description is concise information about the topic, usually in the form of a question or a request. The narrative is a few sentences long and it stipulates what makes a document relevant to the topic. The narrative contains the guidelines for the assessors when judging the relevance of the documents in the next stage. An example of a topic is given below. The English equivalent of the descripof topic 51 is: can a patient with cancer contract anemia? och cancer kan en patient med cancer av anemi? dokument ska inneh˚alla information om vad anemi /blodbrist ¨ar, symtom, behandling och orsaker. Information om cancerrelaterad anemi dels utl¨ost av cancern och dels utl¨ost av cancerbehandlingen ¨ar 5 Selecting Documents to Assess In the ideal test collection every document would be assessed for relevance with respect to every topic. But with over 42 000 documents and 62 topics, taking 8 minutes to assess each document, it would take four persons more than 40 years working 40 hours per week to finish the assessments. Instead, only the documents that were considered most likely to be relevant to each topic were assessed. The documents were filtered out by use of four queries, one specific and one exhaustive for each index. The documents selected for each topic were sorted by document ID and duplicates were removed. This was done so that the assessors would not know how high a document had been ranked, or in how many searches it had been retrieved. For each topic and each of the four queries the 100 highest ranked documents were selected, if, in fact, there were that many. 6 Relevance Judgments For the relevance judgments four new medical students were consulted. For each of 62 topics, an assessor read through the documents to be assessed and decided, for each document, the intended group of readers and the degree of relevance to the topic. The documents for each individual need were assessed by one and the same assessor for reasons of consistency. The MedEval relevance assessments were made on a four graded scale, 0-3, where 0 is ‘Not at all relevant’ and 3 is ‘Highly relevant’. The scale is easily turned into a binary scale by stating that the with the lower grades are to be consid- 2 ered non-relevant and the ones with higher grades relevant. Where the division is made between relevant and non-relevant depends on the needs of the user in each case. The relevance considered by the assessors was topical relevance, how well a document corresponds to a topic. The assessors were instructed not to involve user relevance in this score. Each document was judged on its own merits. The novelty of the contents of a document should not be considered. 7 Target Groups In addition to topical relevance the assessors judged each document for reader target group, that is which group of readers was the intended: Patients, if a document was written for lay persons, or Doctors, if it was written for medical professionals. For a classification of documents according to intended reader group to be useful, there must be a measureable difference between the document classes. Table 2 shows a number of type/token frequencies in different subsets of the collection. In each set duplicates were removed in the case that a document had been assessed for more than one topic. The subsets considered are described below. Full form types are the original terms of the documents before lemmatization and lemma types are the same terms after lemmatization. collection documents of the MedEval collection. documents documents that have been assessed for any topic. assessed documents that for at least one topic have been assessed to have target group Doctors. assessed documents that for at least one topic have been assessed to have target group Patients. files documents that for at least one topic have been assessed to have target group Doctors and for another to have target group Patients. relevant documents that for at least one topic have been assessed to have at least relevance grade 1 and to have target group Doctors. relevant documents that for at least one topic have been assessed to have at least relevance grade 1 and to have target group Patients. Before counting frequencies, the files were cleaned from tags, IDs, dates (in the date tag, not in the actual text), web information and punctuation marks. Some observations are readily made by studying table 2. The number of tokens per document is significantly smaller for the entire collection, than for any subset. This means that there is a large number of short documents that were not retrieved by any query when the documents to be assessed were selected. Maybe not surprising, since short documents contain few terms which can match the queries. The documents in the set ‘Patients assessed’ had only 57% the number of tokens per document, compared to the documents in ‘Doctors assessed’. Even though there were over 1 000 more documents in ‘Patients assessed’ than in ‘Doctors assessed’, there were over 50 000 more lemma types in the doctor documents and almost 30 000 more lemma compound types. The average word length in ‘Doctors assessed’ was 6.29 compared to 5.73 for ‘Patients assessed’. The ratio of compound tokens was also higher in the doctor documents, 0.128 compared to 0.098. Table 3 illustrates the fact that the doctor documents contain more and longer terms and more compounds than patient documents. This table shows frequencies of all full form types of strings bewith in ‘Patients assessed’ and ‘Doctors assessed’ respectively. The patient documents have 18 full form types beginning with doctor documents have 75. That is more than four times more types for the doctor documents. closer look at the frequencies the professional and lay person texts reveals that not all frequencies are higher for professionals. The frequencies of nouns in the definite form in the lay person texts are close to, equal or higher than the same forms in the professional texts. 3 Entire collection Assessed documents Doctors assessed Patients assessed Common Doctors relevant relevant files Number of documents 42 250 7 044 3 272 4 334 562 1 233 1 654</abstract>

Looking at all instances of strings beginning with the two sets of documents there is a significant difference. In the patient documents 66 tokens of 372, or 17.7%, are nouns in the definite form, while the corresponding numbers for the doctor documents is 89 of 932 tokens, or 9.6%. At this stage one can only speculate why this is so. A hypothesis is that doctors/medical professionals often discuss matters in a generic point of view, while patients/lay persons discuss specific cases.

The frequencies of these word forms in the documents written for the two target groups are compared. 8 User Groups The MedEval test collection allows the user to state group: specified group), This choice directs the user to one of three scenarios. The None scenario contains the topical relevance grades as made by the assessors. The Doctors scenario contains the same grades with the exception that the grades of the documents marked for Patients target group are downgraded by one. In same way the Patients scenario has the documents marked for Doctors target group downgraded by one. This means that for a doctor user patient documents originally given relevance 3, are graded with 2, documents given relevance 2 are graded 1 and documents given relevance 1 are graded 0. The same is done in the Patients scenario with the doctor documents. The idea is that a document that is written for a reader from one target group but retrieved for a user from the other group will not be non-relevant, but less useful than a document from the correct target group. Put differently, a document intended for patients would contain information that doctors (hopefully) already know. On the other hand, documents intended for doctors, even though they might be topically relevant for a patient’s need, run a great risk of being written in such a way that a patient will have problems grasping the whole content. Adjusting relevance in the manner described affects the scenario recall bases. Since relevance grades are downgraded for documents of the opposing target group there will be fewer relevant documents in the Doctors and Patients scenarios than in the None scenario. This is demonstrated in figure 1 where the ideal cumulated gain for the three scenarios of topics 28, 36 and 92 are shown. The ideal cumulated gain is the maximum score of retrieved information possible at each position in a ranked list of documents (J¨arvelin, Kek¨al¨ainen, 2002). The score for each position is the sum of all relevance scores so far in the ranked list.

For topic 28 most of the highly relevant and fairly relevant documents were assessed to have target group Doctors. Topic 36 had the relevant documents spread fairly evenly between the Doctors and Patients target groups. Topic 92 showed no documents of any relevance grade for documents marked for target group Doctors. Thus the None and the Patients ideal gain vector coincide fully, while the cumulated gain for the Doctors scenario is very low. doctor and patient documents. Topic 36 has fairly similar cumulated gain curves for the Doctors and Patients scenarios. Topic 28 has a majority of doctor documents, while topic 92 had no documents of any relevance grade for documents marked for target group Doctors. Thus the None and the Patients ideal gain vector coincide fully, while the cumulated gain for the Doctors scenario is very low, originating from downgraded patient documents. 9 Example Runs To demonstrate the effectiveness of search terms from the different styles of language of the two targroups, the synonyms and blodlack’ were run as search keys for topic in the Doctors and Patients scenarios. a neoclassical term, belonging to the professional lanand the corresponding lay person term. In the Doctors scenario the difference between the results of the two search keys was striking: full recall for the neoclassical term quite early in the ranked list of documents and no recall at all for the lay person term. The Patients scenario did not show as big difference between the search keys. Note that the resulting ranked lists of documents is the same for both scenarios for the same search key. It is the relevance grades of the retrieved documents that differ.
