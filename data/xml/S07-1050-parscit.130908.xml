In this paper we describe the MELB-MKB
system, as entered in the SemEval-2007 lex-
ical substitution task. The core of our sys-
tem was the “Relatives in Context” unsuper-
vised approach, which ranked the candidate
substitutes by web-lookup of the word se-
quences built combining the target context
and each substitute. Our system ranked third
in the final evaluation, performing close to
the top-ranked system.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999353043478261">
This paper describes the system we developed for
the SemEval lexical substitution task, a new task in
SemEval-2007. Although we tested different con-
figurations on the trial data, our basic system relied
on WordNet relatives (Fellbaum, 1998) and Google
queries in order to identify the most plausible sub-
stitutes in the context.
The main goal when building our system was to
study the following factors: (i) substitution candi-
date set, (ii) settings of the relative-based algorithm,
and (iii) syntactic filtering. We analysed these fac-
tors over the trial data provided by the organisation,
and used the BEST metric to tune our system. This
metric accepts multiple answers, and averages the
score across the answers. We did not experiment
with the OOT (top 10 answers) and MULTIWORD
metrics.
In the remainder of this paper we briefly intro-
duce the basic Relatives in Context algorithm in Sec-
tion 2. Next we describe our experiments on the trial
data in Section 3. Our final system and its results are
described in Section 4. Finally, our conclusions are
outlined in Section 5.

2 Algorithm
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968689655173">
Our basic algorithm is an unsupervised method pre-
sented in Martinez et al. (2006). This technique
makes use of the WordNet relatives of the target
word for disambiguation, by way of the following
steps: (i) obtain a set of close relatives from Word-
Net for each sense of the target word; (ii) for each
test instance define all possible word sequences that
include the target word; (iii) for each word sequence,
substitute the target word with each relative, and
then query Google; (iv) rank queries according to
the following factors: length of the query, distance
of the relative to the target word, and number of hits;
and (v) select the relative from the highest ranked
query.l
For the querying step, first we tokenise each tar-
get sentence, and then we apply sliding windows of
different sizes (up to 6 tokens) that include the tar-
get word. For each window and each relative in the
pool, we substitute the target word for the relative,
and query Google. The algorithm stops augment-
ing the window for the relative when one of its sub-
strings returns zero hits. The length of the query is
measured as the number of words, and the distance
of the relative to the target words gives preference
to synonyms over hypernyms, and immediate hyper-
nyms over further ones.
One important parameter in this method is the
candidate set. We performed different experiments
to measure the expected score we could achieve

3 Development on Trial data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999821833333333">
In this section we analyse the coverage of WordNet
over the data, the basic parameter exploration pro-
cess, a syntactic filter, and finally the extra experi-
ments we carried out before submission. The trial
data consisted on 300 instances of 34 words with
gold-standard annotations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998988">
3.1 WordNet coverage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989466666667">
The most obvious resource for selecting substitution
candidates was WordNet, due to its size and avail-
ability. We used version 2.0 throughout this work.
In our first experiment, we tried to determine which
kind of relationships to use, and the coverage of the
gold-standard annotations that we could expect from
WordNet relations only. As a basic set of relations,
we used the following: SYNONYMY, SIMILAR-TO,
ENTAILMENT, CAUSE, ALSO-SEE, and INSTANCE.
We created two extended candidate sets using im-
mediate and 2-step hypernyms (hype and hype2, re-
spectively, in Table 1).
Given that we are committed to using Word-
Net, we set out to measure the percentage of gold-
standard substitutes that were “reachable” using dif-
ferent WordNet relations. Table 1 shows the cov-
erage for the three sets of candidates. Instance-
coverage indicates the percentage of instances that
have at least one of the gold-standard instances cov-
ered from the candidate set. We can see that the per-
centage is surprisingly low.
Any shortcoming in coverage will have a direct
impact on performance, suggesting the need for al-
ternate means to obtain substitution candidates. One
possibility is to extend the candidates from Word-
Net by following links from the relatives (e.g. col-
lect all synonyms of the synonymous words), but
this could add many noisy candidates. We can also
use other lexical repositories built by hand or auto-
matically, such as the distributional theusauri built

in Lin (1998). A different approach that we are test-
ing for future work is to adapt the algorithm to work
with wildcards instead of explicit candidates. Due to
time constraints, we only relied on WordNet for our
submission.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9961">
3.2 Parameter Tuning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991575">
In this experiment we tuned different parameters of
the basic algorithm. First, we observed the data in
order to identify the most relevant variables for this
task. We tried to avoid including too many parame-
ters and overfitting the system to the trial dataset. At
this point, we separated the instances by PoS, and
studied the following parameters:
Candidate set: From WordNet, we tested four
possible datasets for each target word: basic-set, 1st-
sense (basic relations from the first sense only), hype
(basic set and immediate hypernyms), and hype2
(basic set and up to two-step hypernyms).
Semcor-based filters: Semcor provides frequency
information for WordNet senses, and can be used
to identify rare senses. As each candidate is ob-
tained via WordNet semantic relations with the tar-
get word, we can filter out those candidates that are
related with unfrequent senses in Semcor. We tested
three configurations: (1) no filter, (2) filter out candi-
dates when the candidate-sense in the relation does
not occur in Semcor, (3) and filter out candidates
when the target-sense in the relation does not oc-
cur in Semcor. The filters can potentially lead to the
removal of all candidates, in which case a back-off
is applied (see below).
Relative-ranking criteria: Our algorithm ranks
relatives according to the length in words of their
context-match. In the case of ties, the number of re-
turned hits from Google is applied. The length can
be different depending on whether we count punc-
tuation marks as separate tokens, and whether the
word-length of substitute multiwords is included.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.988025">
238
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855608695652">
We tested three options: including the target word,
not including the target word (multiwords count as a
single word), and not counting punctuation marks.
Back-off: We need a back-off method in case the
basic algorithm does not find any matches. We
tested the following: sense-ordered synonyms from
WordNet (highest sense first, randomly breaking
ties), and most frequent synonyms from the first sys-
tem (using two corpora: Semcor and BNC).
Number of answers: We also measured the per-
formance for different numbers of system outputs
(1, 2, or 3).
All in all, we performed 324 (4x3x3x3x3) runs
for each PoS, based on the different combinations.
The best scores for each PoS are shown in Table 2,
together with the baselines. We can see that the pre-
cision is above the official WordNet baseline, but is
still very low. The results illustrate the difficulty of
the task. In error analysis, we observed that the per-
formance and settings varied greatly depending on
the PoS of the target word. Adverbs produced the
best performance, followed by nouns. The scores
were very low for adjectives and verbs (the baseline
score for verbs was only 2%).
We will now explain the main conclusions ex-
tracted from the parameter analysis. Regarding the
candidate set, we observed that using synonyms only
was the best approach for all PoS, except for verbs,
where hypernyms helped. The option of limiting the
candidates to the first sense only helped for adjec-
tives, but not for other PoS.
For the Semcor-based filter, our results showed
that the target-sense filter improved the performance
for verbs and adverbs. For nouns and adjectives, the
candidate-sense filter worked best. All in all, apply-
ing the Semcor filters was effective in removing rare
senses and improving performance.
The length criteria did not affect the results signif-
icantly, and only made a difference in some extreme
cases. Not counting the length of the target word
helped slightly for nouns and adverbs, and removing
punctuation improved results for adjectives. Regard-
ing the back-off method, we observed that the count
of frequencies in Semcor was the best approach for
all PoS except verbs, which reached their best per-
formance with BNC frequencies.

to precision (which is the same as recall).
Finally, we observed that the performance for the
BEST score decreased significantly when more than
one answer was returned, probably due to the diffi-
culty of the task.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999537">
3.3 Syntactic Filter
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9966033125">
After the basic parameter analysis, we studied the
contribution of a syntactic filter to remove those can-
didates that, when substituted, generate an ungram-
matical sentence. Intuitively, we would expect this
to have a high impact for verbs, which vary consid-
erably in their subcategorisation properties. For ex-
ample, in the case of the (reduced) target If we order
our lives well ..., the syntactic filter should ideally
disallow candidates such as If we range our lives
well ...
In order to apply this filter, we require a parser
which has an explicit notion of grammaticality, rul-
ing out the standard treebank parsers. We experi-
mented briefly with RASP, but found that the En-
glish Resource Grammar (ERG: Flickinger (2002)),
combined with the PET run-time engine, was the
best fit for out needs. Unfortunately we could not get
unknown word handling working within the ERG
for our submission, such that we get a meaningful
output for a given input string only in the case that
the ERG has full lexical coverage over that string
(we will never get a spanning parse for an input
where we are missing lexical entries). As such, the
syntactic filter is limited in coverage only to strings
where the ERG has lexical coverage.
Ideally, we would have tested this filter on trial
data, but unfortunately we ran out of time. Thus, we
simply eyeballed a sample of examples, and we de-
cided to include this filter in our final submission. As
we will see in Section 4, its effect was minimal. We
plan to perform a complete evaluation of this module
in the near future.

3.4 Extra experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999412">
One of the limitations of the “Relatives in Context”
algorithm is that it only relies on the local con-
text. We wanted to explore the contribution of other
words in the context for the task, and we performed
an experiment including the Topical Signatures re-
source (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, 2004). We
simply counted the overlapping of words shared be-
tween the context and the different candidates. We
only tested this for nouns, for which the results were
below baseline. We then tried to integrate the topic-
signature scores with the “Relatives in Context” al-
gorithm, but we did not improve our basic system’s
results on the trial data. Thus, this approach was not
included in our final submission.
Another problem we observed in error analysis
was that the Semcor-based filters were too strict in
some cases, and it was desirable to have a way of
penalising low frequency senses without removing
them completely. Thus, we weighted senses by the
inverse of their sense-rank. As we did not have time
to test this intuition properly, we opted for applying
the sense-weighting only when the candidates had
the same context-match length, instead of using the
number of hits. We will see the effect of this method
in the next section.

4 Final system
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958315789474">
The test data consisted of 1,710 instances. For our
final system we applied the best configuration for
each PoS as observed in the development experi-
ments, and the syntactic filter. We also incorpo-
rated the sense-weighting to solve ties. The results
of our system, the best competing system, and the
best baseline (WordNet) are shown in Table 3 for the
BEST metric. Precision and recall are provided for
all the instances, and also for the “Mode” instances
(those that have a single preferred candidate).
Our method outperforms the baseline in all cases,
and performs very close to the top system, ranking
third out of eight systems. This result is consistent
in the “further analysis” tables provided by the task
organisers for subsets of data, where our system al-
ways performs close to the top score. The overall
scores are below 13% recall for all systems when
targeting all instances. This illustrates the difficulty
of the task, and the similarity of the top-3 scores sug-

After the release of the gold-standard data, we
tested two extra settings to measure the effect of the
syntactic filter and the sense-weighting in the final
score. We observed that our application of the syn-
tactic filter had almost no effect in the performance,
but sense-weighting increased the overall recall by
0.4% (from 12.3% to 12.7%).

Although the task was difficult and the scores were
low, we showed that by using WordNet and the lo-
cal context we are able to outperform the baselines
and achieve close to top performance. For future
work, we would like to integrate a parser with un-
known word handling in our system. We also aim to
adapt the algorithm to match the target context with
wildcards, in order to avoid explicitly defining the
candidate set.

This technique makes use of the WordNet relatives of the target word for disambiguation, by way of the following steps: (i) obtain a set of close relatives from WordNet for each sense of the target word; (ii) for each test instance define all possible word sequences that include the target word; (iii) for each word sequence, substitute the target word with each relative, and then query Google; (iv) rank queries according to the following factors: length of the query, distance of the relative to the target word, and number of hits; and (v) select the relative from the highest ranked query.l F</context>
