In this paper, we model conversational
roles in terms of distributions of turn level
behaviors, including conversation acts and
stylistic markers, as they occur over the
whole interaction. This work presents a
lightly supervised approach to inducing
role definitions over sets of contributions
within an extended interaction, where the
supervision comes in the form of an out-
come measure from the interaction. The
identified role definitions enable a map-
ping from behavior profiles of each par-
ticipant in an interaction to limited sized
feature vectors that can be used effectively
to predict the teamwork outcome. An em-
pirical evaluation applied to two Massive
Open Online Course (MOOCs) datasets
demonstrates that this approach yields su-
perior performance in learning representa-
tions for predicting the teamwork outcome
over several baselines.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990041637931035">
In language technologies research seeking to
model conversational interactions, modeling ap-
proaches have aimed to identify conversation acts
(Paul, 2012; Wallace et al., 2013; Bhatia et al.,
2014) on a per turn basis, or to identify stances
(Germesin and Wilson, 2009; Mukherjee et al.,
2013; Piergallini et al., 2014; Hasan and Ng, 2014)
that characterize the nature of a speaker’s ori-
entation within an interaction over several turns.
What neither of these two perspectives quite offer
is a notion of a conversational role. And yet,
conversational role is a concept with great utility
in current real world applications where language
technologies may be applied.
Important teamwork is achieved through collab-
oration where discussion is an important medium
for accomplishing work. For example, distributed
work teams are becoming increasingly the norm
in the business world where creating innovative
products in the networked world is a common
practice. This work requires the effective ex-
change of expertise and ideas. Open source
and open collaboration organizations have suc-
cessfully aggregated the efforts of millions of
volunteers to produce complex artifacts such as
GNU/Linux and Wikipedia. Discussion towards
decision making about how to address problems
that arise or how to extend work benefit from
effective conversational interactions. With a grow-
ing interest in social learning in large online
platforms such as Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs), students form virtual study groups and
teams to complete a course project, and thus
may need to coordinate and accomplish the work
through discussion. In all such environments,
discussions serve a useful purpose, and thus the
effectiveness of the interaction can be measured in
terms of the quality of the resulting product.
We present a modeling approach that leverages
the concept of latent conversational roles as an
intermediary between observed discussions and a
measure of interaction success. While a stance
identifies speakers in terms of their positioning
with respect to one another, roles associate speak-
ers with rights and responsibilities, associated
with common practices exhibited by performers
of that role within an interaction, towards some
specific interaction outcome. That outcome may
be achieved through strategies characterized in
terms of conversation acts or language with partic-
ular stylistic characteristics. However, individual
acts by themselves lack the power to achieve a
complex outcome. We argue that roles make up
for this decontextualized view of a conversational
contribution by identifying distributions of con-
versation acts and stylistic features as behavior
profiles indicative of conversational roles. These

approach. Then we describe a series of role

The concept of social role has long been used in
social science fields to describe the intersection
of behavioral, symbolic, and structural attributes
that emerge regularly in particular contexts. The-
ory on coordination in groups and organizations
emphasizes role differentiation, division of labor
and formal and informal management (Kittur and
Kraut, 2010). However, identification of roles as
such has not had a corresponding strong emphasis
in the language technologies community, although
there has been work on related notions. For
example, there has been much previous work mod-
eling disagreement and debate framed as stance
classification (Thomas et al., 2006; Walker et al.,
2012). Another similar line of work studies the
identification of personas (Bamman et al., 2013;
Bamman et al., 2014) in the context of a social
network, e.g. celebrity, newbie, lurker, flamer,
troll and ranter, etc, which evolve through user
interaction (Forestier et al., 2012).
What is similar between stances and personas
on the one hand and roles on the other is that the
unit of analysis is the person. On the other hand,
they are distinct in that stances (e.g., liberal) and
personas (e.g., lurker) are not typically defined in
terms of what they are meant to accomplish, al-
though they may be associated with kinds of things
they do. Teamwork roles are defined in terms of
what the role holder is meant to accomplish.
The notion of a natural outcome associated with
a role suggests a modeling approach utilizing the
outcome as light supervision towards identifica-
tion of the latent roles. However, representations
of other notions such as stances or strategies can
similarly be used to predict outcomes. Cadilhac et
al. maps strategies based on verbal contributions
of participants in a win-lose game into a prediction
of exactly which players, if any, trade with each
other (Cadilhac et al., 2013). Hu et al. (Hu et
al., 2009) predict the outcome of featured article
nominations based on user activeness, discussion
consensus and user co-review relations. In other
work, the authors of (Somasundaran and Wiebe,
2009) adopt manually annotated characters and
leaders to predict which participants will achieve
success in online debates. The difference is the
interpretation of the latent constructs. The latent
construct of a role, such as team leader, is defined
in terms of a distribution of characteristics that
describe how that role should ideally be carried
out. However, in the case of stances, the latent
constructs are learned in order to distinguish one
stance from another or in order to predict who
will win. This approach will not necessarily
offer insight into what marks the most staunch
proponents of a stance, but instead distinguish
those proponents of a stance who are persuasive
from those who are not.
Roles need not only be identified with the
substance of the text uttered by role holders.
Previous work discovers roles in social networks
based on the network structure (Hu and Liu,
2012; Zhao et al., 2013). Examples include such
things as mixed membership stochastic block-
models (MMSB) (Airoldi et al., 2008), similar
unsupervised matrix factorization methods (Hu
and Liu, 2012), or semi-supervised role inference
models (Zhao et al., 2013). However, these ap-
proaches do not standardly utilize an outcome as
supervision to guide the clustering.
Many open questions exist about what team
roles and in what balance would make the ideal
group composition (Neuman et al., 1999), and
how those findings interact with other contextual
factors (Senior, 1997; Meredith Belbin, 2011).
Thus, a modeling approach that can be applied
to new contexts in order to identify roles that
are particularly valuable given the context would
potentially have high practical value.

work. This approach would be similar to prior
work where constraints that describe successful
teams were used to group participants into teams
in which each member’s expertise is modeled so
that an appropriate mixture of expertise can be
achieved in the assignment (Anagnostopoulos et
al., 2010).
In this section, we begin with an introduction of
some basic notations. Then we present an iterative
model, which involves two stages: teamwork qual-
ity prediction and student role matching. Further-
more, we generalize this model to a constrained
version which provides more interpretable role
assignments. In the end, we describe how to
construct student behavior representations from
their teamwork collaboration process.

Suppose we have C teams where students col-
laborate to finish a course project together. The
number of students in the j-th team is denoted as
Nj, (1 G j G Nj). There are K roles across C
teams that we want to identify, where 1 G K G
Nj, bj E [1, C]. That is, the number of roles is
smaller than or equal to the number of students in a
team, which means that each role should have one
student assigned to it, but not every student needs
to be assigned to a role. Each role is associated
with a weight vector Wk E RD to be learned,
1 G k G K and D is the number of dimensions.
Each student i in a team j is associated with a
behavior vector Bj,i E RD. The measurement
of teamwork quality is denoted as Qj for team
j, and ˆQj is the predicted quality. Here, ˆQj is
determined by the inner product of the behavior
vectors of students who are assigned to different
roles and the corresponding weight vectors.
Teamwork Role Identification Our goal is
to find a proper teamwork role assignment that
positively contributes to the collaboration outcome
as much as possible.

Our role identification process is iterative and
involves two stages. The first stage adjusts the
weight vectors to predict the teamwork qual-
ity, given a fixed role assignment that assumes
students are well matched to roles; the second
stage iterates the possible assignments and finds a
matching to maximize our objective measure. The

two stages run iteratively until both role assign-
ment and teamwork quality prediction converge.
Teamwork Quality Prediction: Given the
identified role assignment, i.e. we know who is
assigned to which roles in a team, the focus is to
accurately predict the teamwork quality under this
role assignment. pj,k refers to the student who
is assigned to role k in team j. We minimize
the following objective function to update the role
weight vector W:

<bodyText confidence="0.999017">
Here, A is the regularization parameter; large A
leads to higher complexity penalization. To give
the optimal solution to Equation 1, which is a clas-
sical ridge regression task (Hoerl and Kennard,
2000), we can easily compute the optimal solution
by its closed form representation, as shown in the
Algorithm 1.
Matching Members to Roles: Once the weight
vector W is updated, we iterate over all the
possible assignments and find the best role as-
signment, where the goal is to maximize the
predicted teamwork quality since we want our
assignment of students and roles to be associated
with improvement in the quality of teamwork.
The complexity of brute-force enumeration of all
possible role assignments is exponential. To avoid
such an expensive computational cost, we design
a weighted bipartite graph and apply a maximum
weighted matching algorithm (Ravindra et al.,
1993) to find the best matching under the objective
of maximizing ECj=1 ˆQj. Because this objective is
a summation, we can further separate it into C iso-

The above role identification model puts no con-
straints on the roles that we want to identify in
teamwork. This might result in more effort to
explain how different roles collaborate to produce
the teamwork success. Therefore, we introduce
a constrained role identification model, which is
able to integrate external constraints on roles. For
example, we can require our extracted role set to
contain a role that makes a positive contribution
to the project success and a role that contributes
relatively negatively, instead of extracting several
generic roles. To address such constraints, in the
stage of teamwork quality prediction, we reformu-
late the Equation 2 as follows:

The external constraints are handled by the log
barrier terms (Ahuja et al., 1993). Here, µ+ and
µ_ are positive parameters used to penalize the
violation of role constraints. S+ is the set of roles
that we want to assign students who contribute
positively to the group outcome (i.e. above av-
erage level), and S_ contains the roles that we
want to capture students who contribute negatively
to the group outcome (i.e. below average level).
The solving of Equation 2 cannot directly apply
the previous ridge regression algorithm, thus we
use the Interior Point Method (Potra and Wright,
2000) to solve it. The detailed procedure is illus-
trated in Algorithm 2, where the θ is a constant to
control the shrinkage and η is the learning rate.

In this section, we begin with the dataset descrip-

validation on two MOOCs, followed by a series of
quantitative and qualitative analyses.

4.1 Dataset

<bodyText confidence="0.97599652173913">
Our datasets come from a MOOC provider
NovoEd, and consist of two MOOC courses.
Both courses are teacher professional develop-
ment courses about Constructive Classroom Con-
versations; one is in elementary education and
another is about secondary education. Students
in a NovoEd MOOC have to initiate or join a
team in the beginning of the course. A NovoEd
team homepage consists of blog posts, comments
and other content shared within the group. The
performance measure we use is the final team
project score, which is in the range of 0 to 40.
There are 57 teams (163 students) who survived
until the end in the Elementary education course,
and 77 teams (262 students) who survived for
the Secondary course. The surviving teams are
the ones in which none of the team members
dropped out of the course, and who finished all the
course requirements. For the purpose of varying
teamwork roles K, we only keep the teams with
1675
at least 3 members. Self-identified team leader are
labeled in the dataset.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987539">
4.2 Baselines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999646756756757">
We propose several baselines to extract possible
roles and predict the teamwork quality for compar-
ison with our models. Preprocessing is identical
for baselines as for our approach.
Top K Worst/Best: The worst performing stu-
dent is often the bottleneck in a team, while the
success of a team project largely depends on the
outstanding students. Therefore, we use the top K
worst/best performing students as our identified K
roles. Their behavior representation are then used
to predict the teamwork quality. The performing
scores are only accessible after the course.
K-Means Clustering: Students who are as-
signed to the same roles tend to have similar
activity profiles. To capture the similarities of
student behavior, we adopt a clustering method to
group students in a team into K clusters, and then
assign students to roles based on their distances
to the centroid of clusters. Prediction is then
performed on the basis of those corresponding
behavior vectors. Here, we use K-Means method
for clustering. That is, each cluster is a latent rep-
resentation of a role and each student is assigned
to its closest cluster (role).
Leader: Leaders play important roles for the
smooth functioning of teams, and thus might
have substantial predictive power of team success.
We input our role identification model with only
the identified leader’s behavior representation and
conduct our role identification algorithm as illus-
trated in Algorithm 1. Each team in our courses
have a predefined leader.
Average: The average representation of all
team members is a good indication of team ability
level and thus teamwork success. Here, we av-
erage all team members’ behavior feature vectors
and use that to predict the teamwork quality.

The purpose of our role identification is to find
a role assignment that minimizes the prediction
error, thus we measure the performance of our
models using RMSE (Rooted Mean Square Error).
10-fold Cross Validation is employed to test the
overall performance. Table 2 and Table 3 presents
the results of our proposed models and baselines
on our two courses. Our role identification model
shown in Algorithm 1, is denoted as RI. θ is set as
0.9 and we vary the role number K from 1 to 3 in
order to assess the added value of each additional
role over the first one.

If we set the number of roles K as 1, what
will the role identification pick as the most im-
portant person to the teamwork outcome? From
Table 2 and 3, we find that, RI performs better than
Leader, and either Top K Best gives a good RMSE
in one course and Top K Worst gives a good
RMSE in the other course. This indicates that, the
predefined leader is not always functioning well
in facilitating the teamwork, thus we need a more
fair mechanism to select the proper leading role.
Besides, Top K worst has quite good performance
on the Elementary course, which reflects that the
success of a teamwork is to some extent dependent
on the worst performing student in that team. The
best performing student matters for the teamwork
outcome on the Secondary course.

From Table 2 and 3, in the setting of K=3, RI
achieved better results compared to Top K Best,
Top K Worst and K-means methods. One expla-
nation is that our RI model not only considers indi-
vidual student’s behaviors, but also takes into ac-
count the collaboration patterns through all team-
work. Besides, RI achieves better performance
compared to our baselines as K becomes larger.
We also noticed that Top K Best gives a quite good
approximation to the teamwork quality on both
courses. However, such performing scores that
are used to rank students are not accessible until
the course ends, and have high correlation with
team score. Thus an advantage of our RI model
is that it does not make use of that information.
Compared with all other results, our RI has a good
generalization ability, and achieves both a smallest
RMSE of around 10 across both MOOCs.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801702702703">
By incorporating constraints into the role iden-
tification process, we expect to guide the model
using human intuition such that the results will be
more interpretable, although the prediction error
might increase because of the limitation of the
search space. We present three alternative pos-
sible constrained models here. The RIC model
emphasizes picking one best member, one worst
member and another generic member, which is
achieved by putting one role to S+ and one to S_
as defined in Equation 2. RIC+ aims at picking
three best team members who collaborate to make
the best contribution to the team success, achieved
by putting three roles into S+. Similarly, RIC_
rewards poorly performing students to contribute
to teamwork quality, i.e. putting all roles into S_.
Based on results shown in Table 2 and 3, we
found that RIC+ and RIC work similar as RI
even though RI is slightly better. RIC_ gives
quite unsatisfying performance which shows that
examining the behavior of a set of poorly per-
forming students is not very helpful in predicting
teamwork success. The comparison of RIC+ and
RIC_ can be shown clearly in Figure 2, which
presents the behavior representation of each role
identified by RIC+ and RIC_. Obviously, RIC+
produces positive roles that contribute largely to
the teamwork quality across all feature dimen-
sions; such behaviors are what we want to en-
courage. Those identified roles are diverse and
not symmetrical because each role achieves peaks
at different feature dimensions. On the contrary,
roles identified by RIC_ works negatively towards
teamwork quality and they have homogeneous
behavior representation curves. Therefore, our
constrained models can provide much interpreta-
tion, with a little loss of accuracy compared to RI.

4.4.2 Role Assignment Interpretation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967176470588">
Leading Role Validation: As a validation, we
found that one of our identified roles has substan-
tial overlap with team leaders. For instance, in
the Elementary course, around 70% of students
who are assigned to Role 0 are actual leaders for
RIC and RIC+ models. On the Secondary course,
around 86% students who are in the position of
Role 0 are real team leaders. When it comes
to RIC_, such ratio drops to around 2% for all
roles. This validates the ability of our models in
producing role definitions that make sense.
Information Diffusion: Figure 3 compares the
information diffusion among different identified
roles of RI, RIC, RIC+ and RIC_. The darker
the node, the better grade it achieves. The number
associated with each role indicates the average
final grades (scale 0-100) of all students who are
assigned to this role. The edge represents how
many messages sent from one node to another.
The thicker the edge, the more information it con-
veys. From the figure, we found that, RI performs
similarly with RIC and roles in RIC+ have much
higher grades compared to RIC_. One explana-
tion is that RIC actually does not incorporate many
constraints and is less interpretable compared to
RIC+ and RIC_. As shown in (c), RIC+ Role 0
contributes more information to Role 1 with an
average of 5.5 messages and to Role 2 with weight
6.1. Role 1 and Role 2 also have many messages
communicated with others in their team. However,
less communication happens in RIC_ roles. This
comparison comes much easier when it comes
to each role’s behaviors on different normalized
feature representations as shown in Figure 2 for

RIC+ and RIC− models. It can be concluded
that by incorporating rewarding and penalizing
constraints, our model works effectively in picking
the behavior profiles we want to encourage and
avoid in a teamwork.
Behavior Comparison: Table 4 presents sev-
eral representative posts and their corresponding
behavior features for our identified roles. Most
features shown in Table 4 correspond to the peak
behaviors associated with roles in Figure 2, which
is consistent with our previous interpretation. For
example, RIC+ picks the well performing student
who adds calmness to the teamwork as indicated
by using positive words and adopting collaborative
strategies. On the contrary, RIC− reflects a less
cooperative teamwork, such as strong subjectivity,
negation and negativity indicated in their posts.
In summary, our role identification models pro-
vide quite interpretable identified roles as dis-
cussed above, as well as accurate prediction of
teamwork quality. More interpretability can be
achieved by incorporating intuitive constraints and
sacrificing a bit of accuracy.

<bodyText confidence="0.999660733333333">
In this work, we propose a role identification
model, which iteratively optimizes a team member
role assignment that can predict the teamwork
quality to the utmost extent. Furthermore, we
extend it to a general constrained version that en-
ables humans to incorporate external constraints to
guide the identification of roles. The experimental
results on two MOOCs show that both of our
proposed role identification models can not only
perform accurate predictions of teamwork quality,
but also provide interpretable student role assign-
ment results ranging from leading role validation
to information diffusion.
Even though we have only explored up to 3
roles in this work that would enable us to use most

of our data, our role identification method is capa-
ble to experiment with a larger range of values of
K, such as in the context of Wikipedia (Ferschke et
al., 2015). Furthermore, our model can be directly
applied to other online collaboration scenarios to
help identify the roles that contribute to collab-
oration, not limited in the context of MOOCs.
In the future, we are interested in relaxing the
assumptions that people can take only one role
and roles are taken up by only one person and
incorporating mixed membership role matching
strategies into our method. Furthermore, nonlinear
relationship between roles and performance as
well as the dependencies between roles should be
explored. Last but not least, we plan to take ad-
vantage of our identified roles to provide guidance
and recommendation to those weakly performing
teams for better collaboration and engagement in
online teamworks.

This work presents a lightly supervised approach to inducing role definitions over sets of contributions within an extended interaction, where the supervision comes in the form of an outcome measure from the interaction. The identified role definitions enable a mapping from behavior profiles of each participant in an interaction to limited sized feature vectors that can be used effectively to predict the teamwork outcome. An empirical evaluation applied to two Massive Open Online Course (MOOCs) datasets demonstrates that this approach yields superior performance in learning representations for predicting the teamwork outcome over several baselines.</abstract>

This approach will not necessarily offer insight into what marks the most staunch proponents of a stance, but instead distinguish those proponents of a stance who are persuasive from those who are not. Roles need not only be identified with the substance of the text uttered by role holders. Previous work discovers roles in social networks based on the network structure (Hu and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2013). Examples include such things as mixed membership stochastic blockmodels (MMSB) (Airoldi et al., 2008), similar unsupervised matrix factorization methods (Hu and Liu, 2012), or semi-supervised role inference models (Zhao et al., 2013). However, these approaches do not standardly utilize an outcome as supervision to guide the clustering. Many open questions exist about what team roles and in what balance would make the ideal group composition (Neuman et al., 1999), and how those findings interact with other contextual factors (Senior, 1997; Meredith Belbin, 2011).

Our modeling goal is to identify behavior profiles that describe the emergent roles that team members take up in order to work towards a successful group grade for their team project. Identification of effective role based behavior profiles would enable work towards supporting effective team formation in subsequent 1672 work. This approach would be similar to prior work where constraints that describe successful teams were used to group participants into teams in which each member’s expertise is modeled so that an appropriate mixture of expertise can be achieved in the assignment (Anagnostopoulos et al., 2010). In this section, we begin with an introduction of some basic notations. Then we present an iterative model, which involves two stages: teamwork quality prediction and student role matching. Furthermore, we generalize this model to a constrained version which provides more interpretable role assignments. In the end, we describe how to construct student behavior representations from their teamwork collaboration process. 3.1 Notation Suppose we have C teams where students collaborate to finish a course project together.

Teamwork Quality Prediction: Given the identified role assignment, i.e. we know who is assigned to which roles in a team, the focus is to accurately predict the teamwork quality under this role assignment. pj,k refers to the student who is assigned to role k in team j. We minimize the following objective function to update the role weight vector W: WkT -Bj,pj,k)+A-I1WI12 (1) Here, A is the regularization parameter; large A leads to higher complexity penalization. To give the optimal solution to Equation 1, which is a classical ridge regression task (Hoerl and Kennard, 2000), we can easily compute the optimal solution by its closed form representation, as shown in the Algorithm 1. Matching Members to Roles: Once the weight vector W is updated, we iterate over all the possible assignments and find the best role assignment, where the goal is to maximize the predicted teamwork quality since we want our assignment of students and roles to be associated with improvement in the quality of teamwork. The complexity of brute-force enumeration of all possible role assignments is exponential. To avoid such an expensive computational cost, we design a weighted bipartite grap</context>

However, in the case of stances, the latent constructs are learned in order to distinguish one stance from another or in order to predict who will win. This approach will not necessarily offer insight into what marks the most staunch proponents of a stance, but instead distinguish those proponents of a stance who are persuasive from those who are not. Roles need not only be identified with the substance of the text uttered by role holders. Previous work discovers roles in social networks based on the network structure (Hu and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2013). Examples include such things as mixed membership stochastic blockmodels (MMSB) (Airoldi et al., 2008), similar unsupervised matrix factorization methods (Hu and Liu, 2012), or semi-supervised role inference models (Zhao et al., 2013). However, these approaches do not standardly utilize an outcome as supervision to guide the clustering.

Here, µ+ and µ_ are positive parameters used to penalize the violation of role constraints. S+ is the set of roles that we want to assign students who contribute positively to the group outcome (i.e. above average level), and S_ contains the roles that we want to capture students who contribute negatively to the group outcome (i.e. below average level). The solving of Equation 2 cannot directly apply the previous ridge regression algorithm, thus we use the Interior Point Method (Potra and Wright, 2000) to solve it. The detailed procedure is illustrated in Algorithm 2, where the θ is a constant to control the shrinkage and η is the learning rate. 3.4 Behavior Construction 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 One essential component in our teamwork role identification models is the student behavior representation.

Matching Members to Roles: Once the weight vector W is updated, we iterate over all the possible assignments and find the best role assignment, where the goal is to maximize the predicted teamwork quality since we want our assignment of students and roles to be associated with improvement in the quality of teamwork. The complexity of brute-force enumeration of all possible role assignments is exponential. To avoid such an expensive computational cost, we design a weighted bipartite graph and apply a maximum weighted matching algorithm (Ravindra et al., 1993) to find the best matching under the objective of maximizing ECj=1 ˆQj.

However, these approaches do not standardly utilize an outcome as supervision to guide the clustering. Many open questions exist about what team roles and in what balance would make the ideal group composition (Neuman et al., 1999), and how those findings interact with other contextual factors (Senior, 1997; Meredith Belbin, 2011). Thus, a modeling approach that can be applied to new contexts in order to identify roles that are particularly valuable given the context would potentially have high practical value. 3 Role Identification Models The context of this work is team based MOOCs using the NovoEd platform. In this context, we examine the interaction between team members as they work together to achieve instructional goals in their project work.

However, representations of other notions such as stances or strategies can similarly be used to predict outcomes. Cadilhac et al. maps strategies based on verbal contributions of participants in a win-lose game into a prediction of exactly which players, if any, trade with each other (Cadilhac et al., 2013). Hu et al. (Hu et al., 2009) predict the outcome of featured article nominations based on user activeness, discussion consensus and user co-review relations. In other work, the authors of (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) adopt manually annotated characters and leaders to predict which participants will achieve success in online debates. The difference is the interpretation of the latent constructs. The latent construct of a role, such as team leader, is defined in terms of a distribution of characteristics that describe how that role should ideally be carried out. However, in the case of stances, the latent constructs are learned in order to distinguish one stance from another or in order to predict who will win.

What neither of these two perspectives quite offer is a notion of a conversational role. And yet, conversational role is a concept with great utility in current real world applications where language technologies may be applied.
