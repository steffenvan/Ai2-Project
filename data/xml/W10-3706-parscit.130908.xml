This paper presents the automatic ex-
traction of Complex Predicates (CPs)
in Bengali with a special focus on
compound verbs (Verb + Verb) and
conjunct verbs (Noun /Adjective +
Verb). The lexical patterns of com-
pound and conjunct verbs are extracted
based on the information of shallow
morphology and available seed lists of
verbs. Lexical scopes of compound and
conjunct verbs in consecutive sequence
of Complex Predicates (CPs) have
been identified. The fine-grained error
analysis through confusion matrix
highlights some insufficiencies of lexi-
cal patterns and the impacts of different
constraints that are used to identify the
Complex Predicates (CPs). System
achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and
77.92% for compound verbs and
89.90% and 89.66% for conjunct verbs
respectively on two types of Bengali
corpus.

Complex Predicates (CPs) contain [verb] +
verb (compound verbs) or [noun/
adjective/adverb] +verb (conjunct verbs)
combinations in South Asian languages (Hook,
1974). To the best of our knowledge, Bengali
is not only a language of South Asia but also
the sixth popular language in the World 1 ,
second in India and the national language of
Bangladesh. The identification of Complex
Predicates (CPs) adds values for building
lexical resources (e.g. WordNet (Miller et al.,
1990; VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)),
parsing strategies and machine translation
systems.
Bengali is less computerized compared to
English due to its morphological enrichment.
As the identification of Complex Predicates
(CPs) requires the knowledge of morphology,
the task of automatically extracting the Com-
plex Predicates (CPs) is a challenge. Complex
Predicates (CPs) in Bengali consists of two
types, compound verbs (CompVs) and conjunct
verbs (ConjVs).
The compound verbs (CompVs) (e.g. ����
���� mere phela ‘kill’, ���� ���� bolte laglo
‘started saying’) consist of two verbs. The first
verb is termed as Full Verb (FV) that is present
at surface level either as conjunctive participial
form -e –e or the infinitive form -�� –te. The
second verb bears the inflection based on
Tense, Aspect and Person. The second verbs
that are termed as Light Verbs (LV) are
polysemous, semantically bleached and
confined into some definite candidate seeds
(Paul, 2010).
On the other hand, each of the Bengali con-
junct verbs (ConjVs) (e.g. ���� ��� bharsha

kara ‘to depend’, ���� ��� jhakjhak kara ‘to
glow’) consists of noun or adjective followed
by a Light Verb (LV). The Light Verbs (LVs)
bear the appropriate inflections based on
Tense, Aspect and Person.
According to the definition of multi-word
expressions (MWEs)(Baldwin and Kim, 2010),
the absence of conventional meaning of the
Light Verbs in Complex Predicates (CPs)
entails us to consider the Complex Predicates
(CPs) as MWEs (Sinha, 2009). But, there are
some typical examples of Complex Predicates
(CPs), e.g. ���� ��� dekha kara ‘see-do’ that
bear the similar lexical pattern as Full Verb
(FV)+ Light Verb (LV) but both of the Full
Verb (FV) and Light Verb (LV) loose their
conventional meanings and generate a
completely different meaning (‘to meet’ in this
case).
In addition to that, other types of predicates
such as ���� ��� niye gelo ‘take-go’ (took and
went), ���� ��� diye gelo ‘give-go’ (gave and
went) follows the similar lexical patterns
FV+LV as of Complex Predicates (CPs) but
they are not mono-clausal. Both the Full Verb
(FV) and Light Verb (LV) behave like
independent syntactic entities and they belong
to non-Complex Predicates (non-CPs). The
verbs are also termed as Serial Verb (SV)
(Mukherjee et al., 2006).
Butt (1993) and Paul (2004) have also
mentioned the following criteria that are used
to check the validity of complex predicates
(CPs) in Bengali. The following cases are the
invalid criteria of complex predicates (CPs).

Sometimes, the successive sequence of the
Complex Predicates (CPs) shows a problem of
deciding the scopes of individual Complex
Predicates (CPs) present in that sequence. For
example the sequence, u�� ��� ������ uthe pore
dekhlam ‘rise-wear-see’ (rose and saw) seems
to contain two Complex Predicates (CPs) (u��
��� uthe pore ‘rose’ and ��� ������ pore
dekhlam ‘wore and see’). But there is actually
one Complex Predicate (CP). The first one u��
��� uthe pore ‘rose’ is a compound verb
(CompV) as well as a Complex Predicate (CP).
Another one is ������ dekhlam ‘saw’ that is a
simple verb. As the sequence is not mono-
clausal, the Complex Predicate (CP) u�� ���
uthe pore ‘rose’ associated with ������ dekhlam
‘saw’ is to be separated by a lexical boundary.
Thus the determination of lexical scopes of
Complex Predicates (CPs) from a long con-
secutive sequence is indeed a crucial task.
The present task therefore not only aims to
extract the Complex Predicates (CPs)
containing compound and conjunct verbs but
also to resolve the problem of deciding the
lexical scopes automatically. The compound
verbs (CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs)
are extracted from two separate Bengali
corpora based on the morphological
information (e.g. participle forms, infinitive
forms and inflections) and list of Light Verbs
(LVs). As the Light Verbs (LVs) in the
compound verbs (CompVs) are limited in
number, fifteen predefined verbs (Paul, 2010)
are chosen as Light Verbs (LVs) for framing
the compound verbs (CompVs). A manually
prepared seed list that is used to frame the
lexical patterns for conjunct verbs (ConjVs)
contains frequently used Light Verbs (LVs).
An automatic method is designed to identify
the lexical scopes of compound and conjunct
verbs in the long sequences of Complex
Predicates (CPs). The identification of lexical
scope of the Complex Predicates (CPs)
improves the performance of the system as the
number of identified Complex Predicates
(CPs) increases.
Manual evaluation is carried out on two
types of Bengali corpus. The experiments are
carried out on 800 development sentences
from two corpora but the final evaluation is
carried out on 1000 sentences. Overall, the
system achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and
77.92% for compound verbs and 89.90% and
89.66% for conjunct verbs respectively.

The error analysis shows that not only the
lexical patterns but also the augmentation of
argument structure agreement (Das, 2009), the
analysis of Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or
Serial Verb, Control Construction (CC),
Modal Control Construction (MCC), Passives
(Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC) (Butt,
1993; Paul, 2004) are also necessary to
identify the Complex Predicates (CPs). The
error analysis shows that the system suffers in
distinguishing the Complex Predicates (CPs)
from the above constraint constructions.
The rest of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the related work
done in this area. The automatic extraction of
compound and conjunct verbs is described in
Section 3. In Section 4, the identification of
lexical scopes of the Complex Predicates
(CPs) is mentioned. Section 5 discusses the
results of evaluation along with error analysis.
Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

<bodyText confidence="0.998779327868853">
The general theory of complex predicate is
discussed in Alsina (1996). Several attempts
have been organized to identify complex
predicates in South Asian languages (Abbi,
1991; Bashir, 1993; Verma, 1993) with a spe-
cial focus to Hindi (Burton-Page, 1957; Hook,
1974), Urdu (Butt, 1995), Bengali (Sarkar,
1975; Paul, 2004), Kashmiri (Kaul, 1985) and
Oriya (Mohanty, 1992). But the automatic ex-
traction of Complex Predicates (CPs) has been
carried out for few languages, especially
Hindi.
The task described in (Mukherjee et al.,
2006) highlights the development of a database
based on the hypothesis that an English verb is
projected onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi.
The simple idea of projecting POS tags across
an English-Hindi parallel corpus considers the
Complex Predicate types, adjective-verb (AV),
noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb (Adv-V), and
verb-verb (VV) composites. A similar task
(Sinha, 2009) presents a simple method for
detecting Complex Predicates of all kinds us-
ing a Hindi-English parallel corpus. His simple
strategy exploits the fact that Complex Predi-
cate is a multi-word expression with a meaning
that is distinct from the meaning of the Light
Verb. In contrast, the present task carries the
identification of Complex Predicates (CPs)
from monolingual Bengali corpus based on
morphological information and lexical pat-
terns.
The analysis of V+V complex predicates
termed as lexical compound verbs (LCpdVs)
and the linguistic tests for their detection in
Hindi are described in (Chakrabarti et al.,
2008). In addition to compound verbs, the pre-
sent system also identifies the conjunct verbs
in Bengali. But, it was observed that the identi-
fication of Hindi conjunct verbs that contain
noun in the first slot is puzzling and therefore a
sophisticated solution was proposed in (Das,
2009) based on the control agreement strategy
with other overtly case marked noun phrases.
The present task also agrees with the above
problem in identifying conjunct verbs in Ben-
gali although the system satisfactorily identi-
fies the conjunct verbs (ConjVs).
Paul (2003) develops a constraint-based
mechanism within HPSG framework for com-
posing Indo-Aryan compound verb construc-
tions with special focus on Bangla (Bengali)
compound verb sequences. Postulating seman-
tic relation of compound verbs, another work
(Paul, 2009) proposed a solution of providing
lexical link between the Full verb and Light
Verb to store the Compound Verbs in Indo
WordNet without any loss of generalization.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first
attempt at automatic extraction of Complex
Predicates (CPs) in Bengali.

parser gives different morphological informa-

of Complex Predicates (CPs).

Manual observation shows that the Complex
Predicates (CPs) contain the lexical pattern
{[XXX] (n/adj) [YYY] (v)} in the shallow
parsed sentences where XXX and YYY repre-
sent any word. But, the lexical category of the
root word of XXX is either noun (n) or adjec-
tive (adj) and the lexical category of the root

sentences are pre-processed to generate the

The extraction of Bengali compound verbs
(CompVs) is straightforward rather than con-
junct verbs (ConjVs). The lexical pattern of
compound verb is {[XXX](v) [YYY] (v)} where
the lexical or basic POS categories of the root
words of “XXX” and “YYY” are only verb. If
the basic POS tags of the root forms of “XXX”
and “YYY” are verbs (v) in shallow parsed sen-
tences, then only the corresponding lexical

dates of compound verbs (CompVs).

Bengali, like any other Indian languages, is
morphologically very rich. Different suffixes
may be attached to a Light Verb (LVs) (in this
case [YYY]) depending on the various features
such as Tense, Aspect, and Person.
In case of extracting compound verbs
(CompVs), the Light Verbs are identified from
a seed list (Paul, 2004). The list of Light Verbs
is specified in Table 1. The dictionary forms of
the Light Verbs are stored in this list. As the
Light Verbs contain different suffixes, the pri-
mary task is to identify the root forms of the
Light Verbs (LVs) from shallow parsed result.
Another table that stores the root forms and the
corresponding dictionary forms of the Light
Verbs is used in the present task. The table
contains a total number of 378 verb entries
including Full Verbs (FVs) and Light Verbs
(LVs). The dictionary forms of the Light Verbs
(LVs) are retrieved from the Table.
On the other hand, the conjunctive particip-
ial form -e/i�� -e/iya or the infinitive form -
��/i�� –te/ite are attached with the Full Verbs

(FVs) (in this case [XXX]) in compound verbs
(CompVs). i�� / iya and i��/ ite are also used
for conjunctive participial form -e –e or the
infinitive form -�� –te respectively in litera-
ture. The participial and infinitive forms are
checked based on the morphological informa-
tion (e.g. suffixes of the verb) given in the
shallow parsed results. In Example 1, the Full
Verb (FV) contains -i�� -iya suffix. If the dic-
tionary forms of the Light Verbs (LVs) are pre-
sent in the list of Light Verbs and the Full
Verbs (FVs) contain the suffixes of -e/i�� -
e/iya or ��/i�� –te/ite, both verbs are combined
to frame the patterns of compound verbs
(CompVs).

The identification of conjunct verbs
(ConjVs) requires the lexical pattern (Noun /
Adjective + Light Verb) where a noun or an
adjective is followed by a Light Verb (LV). The
dictionary forms of the Light Verbs (LVs) that
are frequently used as conjunct verbs (ConjVs)
are prepared manually. The list of Light Verbs
(LVs) is given in Table 2. The detection of
Light Verbs (LVs) for conjunct verbs (ConjVs)
is similar to the detection of the Light Verbs
(LVs) for compound verbs (CompVs) as de-
scribed earlier in this section. If the basic POS
of the root of the first words ([XXX]) is either
“noun” or “adj” (n/adj) and the basic POS of
the following word ([YYY]) is “verb” (v), the
patterns are considered as conjunct verbs
(ConjVs). The Example 2 is an example of
conjunct verb (ConjV).
For example, ���� ��� (jhakjhak kara ‘to
glow’), ���� ��� (taktak ‘to glow’), ������ ���
(chupchap kara ‘to silent’) etc are identified as
conjunct verbs (ConjVs) where the basic POS
of the former word is an adjective (adj) fol-
lowed by ��� kara ‘to do’, a common Light
Verb.

But, the extraction of conjunct verbs
(ConjVs) that have a “noun+verb” construction
is descriptively and theoretically puzzling
(Das, 2009). The identification of lexical pat-
terns is not sufficient to recognize the com-
pound verbs (CompVs). For example, �i ��3��
boi deoya ‘give book’ and ���� ��3�� bharsa
deyoa ‘to assure’ both contain similar lexical
pattern (noun+verb) and same Light Verb ��3��
deyoa. But, ���� ��3�� bharsa deyoa ‘to assure’
is a conjunct verb (ConjV) whereas �i ��3�� boi
deoya ‘give book’ is not a conjunct verb
(ConjV). Linguistic observation shows that the
inclusion of this typical category into conjunct
verbs (ConjVs) requires the additional knowl-
edge of syntax and semantics.
In connection to conjunct verbs (ConjVs),
(Mohanty, 2010) defines two types of conjunct
verbs (ConjVs), synthetic and analytic. A syn-
thetic conjunct verb is one in which both the
constituents form an inseparable whole from
the semantic point of view or semantically
non-compositional in nature. On the other
hand, an analytic conjunct verb is semantically
compositional. Hence, the identification of
conjunct verbs requires knowledge of seman-
tics rather than only the lexical patterns.
It is to be mentioned that sometimes, the
negative markers (�� no, ��i nai) are attached
with the Light Verbs u����� uthona ‘do not get
up’ ������� phelona ‘do not throw”. Negative
attachments are also considered in the present
task while checking the suffixes of Light Verbs
(LVs).

Predicates (CPs) can occur in a long sequence.
An automatic method is employed to identify
the Complex Predicates (CPs) along with their
lexical scopes. The lexical category or basic
POS tags are obtained from the parsed sen-
tences.
If the compound and conjunct verbs occur
successively in a sequence, the left most two
successive tokens are chosen to construct the
Complex Predicate (CP). If successive verbs
are present in a sequence and the dictionary
form of the second verb reveals that the verb is
present in the lists of compound Light Verbs
(LV), then that Light Verb (LV) may be a part
of a compound verb (CompV). For that reason,
the immediate previous word token is chosen
and tested for its basic POS in the parsed result.
If the basic POS of the previous word is “verb
(v)” and any suffixes of either conjunctive par-
ticipial form -e/i�� -e/iya or the infinitive form
-��/i�� –te/ite is attached to the previous verb,
the two successive verbs are grouped together
to form a compound verb (CompV) and the
lexical scope is fixed for the Complex Predi-
cate (CP).
If the previous verb does not contain -e/i��
-e/iya or -��/i�� –te/ite inflections, no com-
pound verb (CompV) is framed with these two
verbs. But, the second Light Verb (LV) may be
a part of another Complex Predicate (CP). This
Light Verb (LV) is now considered as the Full
Verb (FV) and its immediate next verb is
searched in the list of compound Light Verbs
(LVs) and the formation of compound verbs
(CompVs) progresses similarly. If the verb is
not in the list of compound Light Verbs, the
search begins by considering the present verb
as Full Verb (FV) and the search goes in a
similar way.
The following examples are given to illus-
trate the formation of compound verbs
(CompVs) and find the lexical scopes of the
compound verbs (CompVs).
��� ���� ���� ��� �����
(ami) (chalte) (giye) (pore) (gelam).
I &lt;fell down while walking&gt;.
Here, “chalte giye pore gelam” is a verb
group. The two left most verbs ���� ���� chalte
giye are picked and the dictionary form of the
second verb is searched in the list of com-
pound Light Verbs. As the dictionary form
(jaoya ‘go’) of the verb ���� giye is present in
the list of compound Light Verbs (as shown in
Table 1), the immediate previous verb ����
chalte is checked for inflections -e/i�� -e/iya
or -��/i�� –te/ite. As the verb ���� chalte con-
tains the inflection -�� -te , the verb group ����
���� chalte giye is a compound verb (CompV)
where ���� giye is a Light Verb and ���� chalte
is the Full Verb with inflection (-�� -te). Next
verb group, ��� ����� pore gelam is identified
as compound verb (CompV) in a similar way
(��+ (-e) por+ (-e) + ����� gelam (jaoya ‘go’)).
Another example is given as follows.

(CompV) u�� ��� where u�� uthe is a Full Verb
with inflection -e –e and ��� pore is a Light
Verb. The final verb ������ dekhlam is
chosen and as there is no other verb present,
the verb ������ dekhlam is excluded from any
formation of compound verb (CompV) by con-
sidering it as a simple verb.
Similar technique is adopted for identifying
the lexical scopes of conjunct verbs (ConjVs).
The method seems to be a simple pattern
matching technique in a left-to-right fashion
but it helps in case of conjunct verbs (ConjVs).
As the noun or adjective occur in the first slot
of conjunct verbs (ConjVs) construction, the
search starts from the point of noun or adjec-
tive. If the basic POS of a current token is ei-
ther “noun” or “adjective” and the dictionary
form of the next token with the basic POS
“verb (v)” is in the list of conjunct Light Verbs
(LVs), then the two consecutive tokens are

<bodyText confidence="0.998899181818182">
combined to frame the pattern of a conjunct
verb (ConjV).
For example, the identification of lexical
scope of a conjunct verb (ConjV) from a se-
quence such as u����� ���� ����� uparjon korte
gelam ‘earn-do-go’ (went to earn) identifies
the conjunct verb (ConjV) u����� ���� uparjon
korte. There is another verb group ���� �����
korte gelam that seems to be a compound verb
(CompV) but is excluded by considering ������
gelam as a simple verb.

<bodyText confidence="0.9994167">
The system is tested on 800 development sen-
tences and finally applied on a collection of
500 sentences from each of the two Bengali
corpora. As there is no annotated corpus avail-
able for evaluating Complex Predicates (CPs),
the manual evaluation of total 1000 sentences
from the two corpora is carried out in the pre-
sent task.
The recall, precision and F-Score are con-
sidered as the standard metrics for the present
evaluation. The extracted Complex Predicates
(CPs) contain compound verb (CompV) and
conjunct verbs (ConjVs). Hence, the metrics
are measured for both types of verbs individu-
ally. The separate results for two separate cor-
pora are shown in Table 3 and Table 4 respec-
tively. The results show that the system identi-
fies the Complex Predicates (CPs) satisfacto-
rily from both of the corpus. In case of Com-
pound Verbs (CompVs), the precision value is
higher than the recall. The lower recall value
of Compound Verbs (CompVs) signifies that
the system fails to capture the other instances
from overlapping sequences as well as non-
Complex predicates (non-CPs).
But, it is observed that the identification of
lexical scopes of compound verbs (CompVs)
and conjunct verbs (ConjVs) from long se-
quence of successive Complex Predicates
(CPs) increases the number of Complex Predi-
cates (CPs) entries along with compound verbs
(CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs). The
figures shown in bold face in Table 3 and Ta-
ble 4 for the Travel and Tourism corpus and
Short Story corpus of Rabindranath Tagore
indicates the improvement of identifying lexi-
cal scopes of the Complex Predicates (CPs).
In comparison to other similar language
such as Hindi (Mukerjee et al., 2006) (the re-
ported precision and recall are 83% and 46%
respectively), our results (84.66% precision
and 83.67% recall) are higher in case of ex-
tracting Complex Predicates (CPs). The reason
may be of resolving the lexical scope and han-
dling the morphosyntactic features using shal-
low parser.
In addition to Non-MonoClausal Verb
(NMCV) or Serial Verb, the other criteria
(Butt, 1993; Paul, 2004) are used in our pre-
sent diagnostic tests to identify the complex
predicates (CPs). The frequencies of
Compound Verb (CompV), Conjunct Verb
(ConjV) and the instances of other constraints
of non Complex Predicates (non-CPs) are
shown in Figure 2. It is observed that the num-
bers of instances of Conjunct Verb (ConjV),
Passives (Pass), Auxiliary Construction (AC)
and Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or Serial
Verb are comparatively high than other in-
stances in both of the corpus.

The error analysis is conducted on both of
the corpus. Considering both corpora as a
whole single corpus, the confusion matrix is
developed and shown in Table 5. The bold face
figures in Table 5 indicate that the percentages
of non-Complex Predicates (non-CPs) such as
Non-MonoClausal Verbs (NMCV), Passives
(Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC) that
are identified as compound verbs (CompVs).
The reason is the frequencies of the non-
Complex Predicates (non-CPs) that are rea-
sonably higher in the corpus. In case of con-
junct verbs (ConjVs), the Non-MonoClausal
Verbs (NMCV) and Auxiliary Construction
(AC) occur as conjunct verbs (ConjVs). The
system also suffers from clausal detection that
is not attempted in the present task. The Pas-
sives (Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC)
requires the knowledge of semantics with ar-
gument structure knowledge.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894">
In this paper, we have presented a study of
Bengali Complex Predicates (CPs) with a spe-
cial focus on compound verbs, proposed auto-
matic methods for their extraction from a cor-
pus and diagnostic tests for their evaluation.
The problem arises in case of distinguishing
Complex Predicates (CPs) from Non-Mono-
Clausal verbs, as only the lexical patterns are
insufficient to identify the verbs. In future task,
the subcategorization frames or argument
structures of the sentences are to be identified
for solving the issues related to the errors of
the present system.

Manual evaluation is carried out on two types of Bengali corpus. The experiments are carried out on 800 development sentences from two corpora but the final evaluation is carried out on 1000 sentences. Overall, the system achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and 77.92% for compound verbs and 89.90% and 89.66% for conjunct verbs respectively. 38 The error analysis shows that not only the lexical patterns but also the augmentation of argument structure agreement (Das, 2009), the analysis of Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or Serial Verb, Control Construction (CC), Modal Control Construction (MCC), Passives (Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC) (Butt, 1993; Paul, 2004) are also necessary to identify the Complex Predicates (CPs).

The analysis of V+V complex predicates termed as lexical compound verbs (LCpdVs) and the linguistic tests for their detection in Hindi are described in (Chakrabarti et al., 2008). In addition to compound verbs, the present system also identifies the conjunct verbs in Bengali. But, it was observed that the identification of Hindi conjunct verbs that contain noun in the first slot is puzzling and therefore a sophisticated solution was proposed in (Das, 2009) based on the control agreement strategy with other overtly case marked noun phrases. The present task also agrees with the above problem in identifying conjunct verbs in Bengali although the system satisfactorily identifies the conjunct verbs (ConjVs). Paul (2003) develops a constraint-based mechanism within HPSG framework for composing Indo-Aryan compound verb constructions with special focus on Bangla (Bengali) compound verb sequences.

On the other hand, an analytic conjunct verb is semantically compositional. Hence, the identification of conjunct verbs requires knowledge of semantics rather than only the lexical patterns.

The compound verbs (CompVs) (e.g. ���� ���� mere phela ‘kill’, ���� ���� bolte laglo ‘started saying’) consist of two verbs. The first verb is termed as Full Verb (FV) that is present at surface level either as conjunctive participial form -e –e or the infinitive form -�� –te. The second verb bears the inflection based on Tense, Aspect and Person. The second verbs that are termed as Light Verbs (LV) are polysemous, semantically bleached and confined into some definite candidate seeds (Paul, 2010). On the other hand, each of the Bengali conjunct verbs (ConjVs) (e.g. ���� ��� bharsha 1http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distributio n.asp?by=size 37 Proceedings of the Multiword Expressions: From Theory to Applications (MWE 2010), pages 37–45, Beijing, August 2010 kara ‘to depend’, ���� ��� jhakjhak kara ‘to glow’) consists of noun or adjective followed by a Light Verb (LV).

The present task therefore not only aims to extract the Complex Predicates (CPs) containing compound and conjunct verbs but also to resolve the problem of deciding the lexical scopes automatically. The compound verbs (CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs) are extracted from two separate Bengali corpora based on the morphological information (e.g. participle forms, infinitive forms and inflections) and list of Light Verbs (LVs). As the Light Verbs (LVs) in the compound verbs (CompVs) are limited in number, fifteen predefined verbs (Paul, 2010) are chosen as Light Verbs (LVs) for framing the compound verbs (CompVs). A manually prepared seed list that is used to frame the lexical patterns for conjunct verbs (ConjVs) contains frequently used Light Verbs (LVs). An automatic method is designed to identify the lexical scopes of compound and conjunct verbs in the long sequences of Complex Predicates (CPs). The identification of lexical scope of the Complex Predicates (CPs) improves the performance of the system as the number of identified Complex Predicates (CPs) increases. Manual evaluation is carried out on two types of Bengali corpus. </context>

The error analysis shows that the system suffers in distinguishing the Complex Predicates (CPs) from the above constraint constructions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the related work done in this area. The automatic extraction of compound and conjunct verbs is described in Section 3. In Section 4, the identification of lexical scopes of the Complex Predicates (CPs) is mentioned. Section 5 discusses the results of evaluation along with error analysis.

Different suffixes may be attached to a Light Verb (LVs) (in this case [YYY]) depending on the various features such as Tense, Aspect, and Person. In case of extracting compound verbs (CompVs), the Light Verbs are identified from a seed list (Paul, 2004). The list of Light Verbs is specified in Table 1. The dictionary forms of the Light Verbs are stored in this list. As the Light Verbs contain different suffixes, the primary task is to identify the root forms of the Light Verbs (LVs) from shallow parsed result. Another table that stores the root forms and the corresponding dictionary forms of the Light Verbs is used in the present task. The table contains a total number of 378 verb entries including Full Verbs (FVs) and Light Verbs (LVs). The dictionary forms of the Light Verbs (LVs) are retrieved from the Table.

In comparison to other similar language such as Hindi (Mukerjee et al., 2006) (the reported precision and recall are 83% and 46% respectively), our results (84.66% precision and 83.67% recall) are higher in case of extracting Complex Predicates (CPs). The reason may be of resolving the lexical scope and handling the morphosyntactic features using shallow parser. In addition to Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or Serial Verb, the other criteria (Butt, 1993; Paul, 2004) are used in our present diagnostic tests to identify the complex predicates (CPs). The frequencies of Compound Verb (CompV), Conjunct Verb (ConjV) and the instances of other constraints of non Complex Predicates (non-CPs) are shown in Figure 2. It is observed that the numbers of instances of Conjunct Verb (ConjV), Passives (Pass), Auxiliary Construction (AC) and Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or Serial Verb are comparatively high than other instances in both of the corpus.

In addition to compound verbs, the present system also identifies the conjunct verbs in Bengali. But, it was observed that the identification of Hindi conjunct verbs that contain noun in the first slot is puzzling and therefore a sophisticated solution was proposed in (Das, 2009) based on the control agreement strategy with other overtly case marked noun phrases. The present task also agrees with the above problem in identifying conjunct verbs in Bengali although the system satisfactorily identifies the conjunct verbs (ConjVs). Paul (2003) develops a constraint-based mechanism within HPSG framework for composing Indo-Aryan compound verb constructions with special focus on Bangla (Bengali) compound verb sequences. Postulating semantic relation of compound verbs, another work (Paul, 2009) proposed a solution of providing lexical link between the Full verb and Light Verb to store the Compound Verbs in Indo WordNet without any loss of generalization. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt at automatic extraction of Complex Predicates (CPs) in Bengali. 3 Identification of Complex Predicates (CPs) The compound verbs </context>

In Section 4, the identification of lexical scopes of the Complex Predicates (CPs) is mentioned. Section 5 discusses the results of evaluation along with error analysis. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related Work The general theory of complex predicate is discussed in Alsina (1996). Several attempts have been organized to identify complex predicates in South Asian languages (Abbi, 1991; Bashir, 1993; Verma, 1993) with a special focus to Hindi (Burton-Page, 1957; Hook, 1974), Urdu (Butt, 1995), Bengali (Sarkar, 1975; Paul, 2004), Kashmiri (Kaul, 1985) and Oriya (Mohanty, 1992). But the automatic extraction of Complex Predicates (CPs) has been carried out for few languages, especially Hindi. The task described in (Mukherjee et al., 2006) highlights the development of a database based on the hypothesis that an English verb is projected onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi. The simple idea of projecting POS tags across an English-Hindi parallel corpus considers the Complex Predicate types, adjective-verb (AV), noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb (Adv-V), and verb-verb (VV) composites.
