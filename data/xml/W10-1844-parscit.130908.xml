In this paper, we report on the annotation
procedures we developed for annotating
the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB), an
effort that extends the Penn Discourse
Tree Bank (PDTB) annotation style by
using it for annotating Turkish discourse.
After a brief introduction to the TDB, we
describe the annotation cycle and the
annotation scheme we developed,
defining which parts of the scheme are an
extension of the PDTB and which parts
are different. We provide inter-coder
reliability calculations on the first and
second arguments of some connectives
and discuss the most important sources of
disagreement among annotators.

1.1 The Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936025641026">
The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) project aims
to annotate the 500,000-word-subcorpus of the
two-million-word METU Turkish Corpus (MTC)
(Say et al, 2002). The subcorpus includes a wide
range of texts, e.g. fiction, interviews, memoirs,
news articles, etc. reflecting the distribution of
the genres in the MTC (Zeyrek et al, 2009). The
main objective of the project is to annotate
discourse connectives with their two arguments,
modifiers and supplementary text spans.
Following the Penn Discourse Tree Bank
(PDTB), we take discourse connectives as
discourse-level predicates taking two (and only
two) arguments, called Arg1 and Arg2, which
may span one or more clauses and sentences that
are adjacent or nonadjacent to the connective
(Prasad et al, 2007, Webber, 2004). Discourse
relations can certainly be expressed without
connectives but we have chosen to annotate
discourse relations encoded by connectives since
they are more specific about their semantics.
Discourse connectives are identifiable from
three syntactic classes, namely, coordinating
conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions, and
discourse adverbials. As in the PDTB, we take
elements belonging to these syntactic classes as
discourse connectives when they semantically
relate syntactic entitities such as clauses,
sentences, sequences of sentences, and
nominalizations having an abstract object
interpretation i.e., eventualities, possibilities,
situations, facts, and propositions (as in Asher,
1993, cf. Webber, et al, 2005). Major departures
from the PDTB are, attribution is not annotated,
only overt connectives are being annotated, and
the nominal arguments of connectives are being
annotated where they denote an abstract object.
Annotation of implicit connectives is further
work.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999379">
Before the annotation process started, the
annotators studied the guidelines, which defined
some general principles and illustrated difficult
cases. The guidelines were written in a way to
allow the annotators enough freedom to reflect
their intuitions on the annotations. The
annotators were also told to observe the
minimality principle (MP) of the PDTB
guidelines, which expects them to mark as
argument parts of a clause or sentence that are

minimally sufficient and necessary for the
discourse relation encoded by the connective.
The annotation cycle includes three steps.
First, the annotators go through the whole
subcorpus to annotate a given connective at a
time. Any disagreements are discussed and
resolved by the project team. In the second step,
the definitions in the annotation guidelines are
revised with the new issues that emerged in
annotating the connective. Finally, the agreed
annotations are checked to ensure they obeyed
the annotation guidelines fully. The annotations
were created by a tool designed by Aktaş (2008).
The connectives are being annotated for the
categories given in the next section by three
annotators, who have been in the project since
the annotation effort started. The three-step
annotation process and the number of annotators
we use slow down the task considerably but
given the complexity of discourse annotation and
the need for annotation efforts in Turkish, we
were compelled to target maximum reliability
achieved by three annotators.
The inter-coder reliability has recently
stabilized and to speed the annotation effort, two
annotators have started to carry out their task as a
pair, while the other annotator works
independently. This annotation style involves
two annotators working side-by-side at one
computer, continuously collaborating on one
connective type at a time to code all its tokens in
the subcorpus. One of the annotators carries out
the task on the annotation tool, while the other
observes her continuously for any defects and
problems and suggests alternative solutions. This
style of annotation, created by our group
independently of pair programming, corresponds
to the practice explained in Williams, et al
(2000) and Williams and Kessler (2000). It is
quite a beneficial and reliable method that also
speeds up the process (Demirşahin, et al ms). 1
We give the preliminary results of this procedure
in section 2.1.4.

In Turkish, coordinators are typically
s(entence)-medial, they may also be found s-
initially, or s-finally. Coordinators show an
affinity with the second clause, as evidenced by
punctuation and their ability to move to the end
of the second clause. Subordinators take as their
second argument a nonfinite clause that contains
a genitive marked subject that agrees with the
subordinate verb in terms of person and number.
The subordinate clause may also be assigned
case by the postposition that functions as the
connective. The subordinator and its host clause
are always adjacent and the subordinate clause
may appear s-initially or s-finally. Anaphoric
connectives are characterized by an anaphoric
element in the phrase and hence they have the
ability to access the inference in the prior
discourse (Webber, et al 2003). Furthermore,
they may take as their first argument text spans
that are nonadjacent to the sentence containing
the connective (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008).3 As
example (1) illustrates, discourse adverbials can
be used with connectives from other syntactic
classes, e.g. a coordinating conjunction, fakat
‘but’ may be used with sonradan ‘then’, and in
accessing its first argument, the discourse
adverbial may cross one or more clauses. In the
examples, Arg1 is italicized, Arg2 set in bold,
and the connective head is underlined.
2 The capital letters are used to capture the cases where a
vowel agrees with the vowel harmony rules of the language.
The vowel rendered by the capital letter I may be resolved
as any of the high vowels in the language, i.e., i, Ÿ, õ, u.
3In the PDTB, expressions like after that are coded as
“alternative lexicalization” while coding implicit
connectives, i.e., as a “nonconnective expression” (Prasad et
al, 2007:22). In Turkish, such phrasal expressions are
abundant. They are two-part expressions with one part
referring to the relation, the other anaphorically to Arg1 as
in English. We decided to take these expressions as
connectives because otherwise, we would be missing an
important fact about Turkish. Therefore they are being
annotated as connectives in the TDB project.

Largely following the annotation style of the
PDTB, we determined the categories that form
the annotation of a relation as follows:
Conn: This is the connective head of an
explicit connective.
Arg2: This tag refers to the argument that
forms a syntactic unit with the connective.
Arg1: This tag is for the other argument that
the connective relates semantically to Arg2.
Sup1/Sup2: This attribute specifies either the
material that makes the semantic contribution of
the argument more specific (as in the PDTB), or
the clause/sentence where an anaphoric element
expressed in the argument is resolved. The Sup
tag is not specifically used for anaphor resolution
in the PDTB.
Mod: This tag specifies the following
features: (a) the adverbs that are used along with
connective heads, e.g. tam aksine ‘just to the
contrary’, (b) the focus particle dE used together
with the connective head (e.g., ve de ‘and-focus
particle ‘and’), (c) adverbs showing the
determinacy of the relation, e.g. belki ‘perhaps’,
sadece ‘only’ etc., (d) polarity of postpositional
phrases (e.g. igin dekil ‘not for’). In the PDTB,
the Mod category is utilized only for adverbs
used together with connective heads. The other
categories are used to capture aspects of
attribution and verbs of attribution.
Shared: This attribute identifies the subjects,
objects, or any temporal adverbs shared by the
arguments of the discourse relation. This
category was required for Turkish, which is a
pro-drop and free word-order language. In
Turkish, subjects, objects or adverbs can appear
s-initially, s-medially or s-finally. Subjects and
objects are dropped if they are salient in the
discourse. This category allows us to capture the
variable position of subjects, objects and adverbs
shared by the arguments of a discourse relation.
The PDTB does not have this feature.
In what follows, we will report on the inter-
coder reliability statistics on Arg1 and Arg2 of a
set of connectives for which we obtained low
inter-coder reliability results and discuss the
most common inconsistencies. The remaining
categories mentioned above are under use but
inter-coder reliability statistics have not been
calculated for them.
2 A quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of the inconsistent
annotations in the TDB
So far, 60 types of discourse connectives
amounting to 6873 relations have been annotated
in the TDB project. We computed the reliability
of the coders’ agreement for Arg1 and Arg2 of
these connectives by means of the Kappa statistic
(Carletta, 1996). A value of K agreement
coefficient (henceforth K values) between 0.80
and 1.00 shows a good agreement, and a value
between 0.60 and 0.80 indicates some agreement
(Poesio, 2000). The K values we obtained for
Arg1 and Arg2 of most connectives annotated so
far range between 0.80 and 1.00 but for the
connectives that are in focus in this paper, the K
values for Arg1 are less than 0.80 (see Appendix
B). It is these connectives that we now turn to.
These connectives are listed below again,
along with the K values obtained for their Arg1
and Arg2. Before calculating the K values, all
annotated text spans were re-processed in order
to express the annotations in (pseudo) categories.
During re-processing, for each annotator the
annotated text span boundary characters (i.e., the
beginning and end characters) were coded as 1
and the remaining text was coded as 0, so that an
agreement table could be constructed (Artstein,
and Poesio, 2008; Di Eugenio and Glass,
2004). It is on the basis of this table which we
measured inter-coder reliability.

As seen in Table 2, inter-coder agreement in
discontinuous connectives is high. We argue that
discontinuous connectives are maximally
different from anaphoric connectives (and
discourse adverbials) since they unambiguously
draw the boundaries of their arguments. As a
result, the inter-coder reliability tests yield good
agreements, with K values &gt; 0.80. Anaphoric
connectives relate their second argument with
another argument adjacent or nonadjacent to the
connective, in a way much similar to how
definite NPs find their antecedents in the
previous discourse. Depending on the relation
encoded by the connective, the previous
discourse is likely to contain clauses that
elaborate and expand a generalization, refute an
assertion, list the components of a statement,
explain the cause of an eventuality, etc. It may
not be an easy task to decide whether one should
take all or part of these clauses as Arg1;
therefore inconsistencies are expected in drawing
the Arg1’s boundaries. Arg2, on the other hand,
is relatively easier to determine since it is
syntactically related to the connective and hence
its domain is determined.
Example (2), which shows a relation encoded
by the connective tersine ‘on the contrary’,
presents one of the most common cases of
inconsistency in determining the Arg1 span.

on the contrary, (it) is his action.
Two annotators selected as Arg1 the italicized
part in (2c) while the third one selected as Arg1
the clauses in (2a), and (2c). In fact, a careful
analysis of the discourse connective tersine ‘on
the contrary’ reveals that in all tokens in the
corpus, the speaker introduces an assertion, then
refutes some aspect of it with an overt negation
and then rectifies it in Arg2. (Turan and Zeyrek,
2010). The third annotator’s selection of Arg1 is
compatible with this observation, while the other
annotators’ selection of Arg1 appears to be
guided by the MP.

2.1 Common Sources of Disagreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990833333333">
An examination of the 8 connectives for which
K values were below 0.80 for Arg1 or Arg2
showed that there were 6 main sources for the
inconsistencies. These were (a) no overlapping
annotations for Arg1, (b) partially overlapping
annotations for Arg1 or (c) Arg2, (d) lack of
adequate definitions in the guidelines, (e)
annotators’ errors in following the linguistic
definitions in the guidelines, (f) other
inconsistencies, e.g., errors in selecting spaces,
leaving characters out, etc. (Appendix A). 4
Among these, partially overlapping Arg1
annotations is the major source of discrepancy
observed in 63.98% of the inconsistent cases,
followed by partially overlapping Arg2
annotations observed in 10.17% of the cases, and
no overlapping annotations in 9.74% of the
cases. While errors grouped under the ‘other’
category is 9.74%, annotators’ errors in
following the linguistic definitions in the
guidelines is negligible (2.97%). The percentage
of lacking definitions in the guidelines is also
low (3.39%), showing that the coverage is good

common sources of disagreement among
annotators.
2.1.1 Interpretations of the minimality
principle
A frequent reason for inconsistent annotations
was lack of agreement in determining the exact
boundaries of argument spans, which is
ultimately related to how the MP is interpreted.
For example, in (3), the connective fakat ‘but’
may be taken as linking clauses (3a) and (3b).
Yet, the scope of the predicative morpheme (i.e.
–tõr in (3c)) that determines finiteness is shared
by the verbs of (3b) and (3c), i.e. this morpheme
takes into its scope two consecutive clauses.
While two annotators coded only clause (3b) as
Arg2, the third annotator tended to interpret Arg2
as the clauses within the scope of the shared
predicative morpheme (-tõr), coding (3b) and
(3c) as Arg2. It appears that the disagreement in
example (3) stems from different interpretations
of the MP coupled with a structural property of
Turkish.

But later on, loosening this tradition, (they)

finally, it was believed that it would be sufficient
to throw a stone or paper animal figures to the
water, as well as other objects that represent
these animals.
The text given in (4) further illustrates a case
where the annotators disagreed on the final
boundary of Arg2. One annotator selected as
Arg2 the span “this is .. noted” (4b), while the
other annotators selected the span “this is.... a
lost place” ((4b)-(4c)); i.e., they included as Arg2
not only the clause adjacent to the connective,
but they also selected the clause that followed
where the cataphor is resolved. Faced with such
inconsistencies, we decided to annotate the
material that is needed for pronoun resolution as
supplementary text. In this case, the clause in
(4c) is marked as Sup2.

The inconsistencies that derive from different
interpretations of the minimality requirement is
particularly interesting from a theoretical
perspective. It appears that this principle may be
interpreted as syntactic minimality as illustrated
in example (3), and as a factor that goes against
basic insights of discourse interpretation such as
anaphor/cataphor resolution as in example (4). In
the former case, the MP pulls the annotators in
one direction, and the need to reflect their
understanding of the discourse in the annotations
pulls them in the opposite direction, especially
when there is morphological/syntactic evidence
for them to choose more than one clause. In the
latter case, the annotators seem to feel they
would lose the anaphoric/coreference chains in
the discourse if they left out the text span where
the anaphor was resolved. After using the Sup
label for anaphor resolution/coreference chains,
disagreements of the latter sort diminished
considerably but this was a methodological
approach with a bias towards the MP rather than
the desired solution of the role of
anaphoric/coreference chains in argument spans.
We aim to tackle this issue in further research.
A parenthetical or evaluative clause in the
argument span also led to inconsistencies in
determining argument boundaries. For example,
the annotators gave conflicting decisions as to
whether or not they should select parenthetical
clauses, especially when they are s-medial, as in
(5):
(5)
Kemal, bir yandan askeri bir savaş
verirken šte yandan yerli
i§birlikgilerle –ki bunlarin başinda

the media.

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999674333333333">
Disagreements that arise from parenthetical
clauses have diminished after we added a new
principle to the guidelines, asking annotators to
select the parenthetical together with the
argument if it contributed to the meaning of the
argument.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.476309">
2.1.2 Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999582076923077">
Another reason for inconsistent annotations
was ambiguity in meaning. Consider example (1)
once again, where the contrast relation can be
interpreted in three ways: it is not clear whether
the contrast is between to be surprised in (1a)
and to regain composure in (1c) or whether it is
between not expecting such a thing in (1b) and to
regain composure in (1c). Alternatively, the
contrast can be interpreted between (1a) and (1b)
on the one hand, and between (1a) and (1c) on
the other. We observed that some of the
disagreements concerning the span of Arg 1
stemmed from such cases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.856805">
2.1.3 Type of discourse relation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983589113636364">
Yet another type of inconsistency appears to
be associated with the type of discourse relation.
Sanders and Noordman (2000) and Pitler, et. al.
(2008) state that causal (contingency) relations
are among the most salient coherence relations.
They suggest that the connectives that signal
comparison and contingency are mostly
unambiguous. Being cognitively salient, causal
and contingency relations are more tightly
organized than the additive list relation. This is
because in causal relations, one target sentence is
more important than the other; while in a list
relation there is more than one sentence
contributing to the discourse. Sanders and
Noordman (2000:53) argue that causal relations
are more strongly connecting than additive
relations. This salience in discourse relations can
be universal. In fact, we found that the inter-
coder agreement of the causal connective günkü
‘because’ was high (0.888 for Arg1 and 0.941 for
Arg2). However, for the connective ayrõca ‘in
addition toÕ, which encodes the list relation, the
inter-coder K value was 0.545 for Arg1, 0.765
for Arg 2. An example of the list reading
interpretation of this connective is illustrated in
(6) below.
(6)
a. Babanin yaşami artik derli toplu olmuştu.
The father’s life now became orderly.
b. Evde kavgalar da azalmişti.
The fights at home have diminished
c. Ayrõca yeni bir 9evrede de bulunuyorlardi.
Besides, (they) are now in a new
neighborhood.
In the extract given in (6), the topic under
discussion seems to be the list of the family’s
diminishing problems: Father’s having an
orderly life, reduced fights at home, etc. While
two annotators preferred to select (6b) as Arg 1,
the third one preferred to select (6a) and (6b)
together. The connective ayrõca, marking a
weaker relation between its two arguments, is
among the connectives that yielded such
instances of disagreement.

2.1.4 Nominalized arguments
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999688">
In this section, we will report on some
preliminary results about a common
inconsistency that occurred while annotating the
connective ve ‘and,’ namely the problem of
teasing apart nominalized arguments that have an
abstract object interpretation and those that do
not. We also explain the pair annotation process.
In Turkish, a nominalizing process realized by
various inflectional suffixes forms nonfinite
clauses. The clauses formed by some of these
suffixes are abstract enough to be easily
specified as an argument of a discourse relation,
e.g. –mAk. On the other hand, some of the
suffixes (e.g. –mA, -Iş) are very productive in
deriving ordinary nouns referring to actual
instances or things. It is these cases where
disagreement among the annotators increases.
Example (7) illustrates the use of –mAk, where
the clauses it forms were easily determined as
arguments with abstract object interpretations.

What the 18th century did was to increase and
to extend what the 17th century created.
Example (8) shows a difficult case where the
annotators were inconsistent in deciding whether
the connective’s arguments have abstract object
interpretations or not. This is because the
morphological form of the words gelişme
(improve-mA) ‘improvement’ and yapõlaşma
(construct-mA) ‘(re)construction’ are very much
the same as the words bekleme (wait-mA)
‘waiting’ and arama (search-mA) ‘search,
searching’ shown in (9). The final decision was
to annotate (9) only.

After a brief introduction to the TDB, we describe the annotation cycle and the annotation scheme we developed, defining which parts of the scheme are an extension of the PDTB and which parts are different. We provide inter-coder reliability calculations on the first and second arguments of some connectives and discuss the most important sources of disagreement among annotators. 1 A brief introduction to the Turkish Discourse Bank 1.1 The Data The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) project aims to annotate the 500,000-word-subcorpus of the two-million-word METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al, 2002). The subcorpus includes a wide range of texts, e.g. fiction, interviews, memoirs, news articles, etc. reflecting the distribution of the genres in the MTC (Zeyrek et al, 2009). The main objective of the project is to annotate discourse connectives with their two arguments, modifiers and supplementary text spans. Following the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB), we take discourse connectives as discourse-level predicates taking two (and only two) arguments, called Arg1 and Arg2, which may span one or more clauses and sentences that are adjacent or nonadjacent to the connective (Prasad et al, 2007</context>

Two annotators selected as Arg1 the italicized part in (2c) while the third one selected as Arg1 the clauses in (2a), and (2c). In fact, a careful analysis of the discourse connective tersine ‘on the contrary’ reveals that in all tokens in the corpus, the speaker introduces an assertion, then refutes some aspect of it with an overt negation and then rectifies it in Arg2. (Turan and Zeyrek, 2010). The third annotator’s selection of Arg1 is compatible with this observation, while the other annotators’ selection of Arg1 appears to be guided by the MP. 2.1 Common Sources of Disagreement An examination of the 8 connectives for which K values were below 0.80 for Arg1 or Arg2 showed that there were 6 main sources for the inconsistencies. These were (a) no overlapping annotations for Arg1, (b) partially overlapping annotations for Arg1 or (c) Arg2, (d) lack of adequate definitions in the guidelines, (e) annotators’ errors in following the linguistic definitions in the guidelines, (f) other i</context>

Discourse connectives are identifiable from three syntactic classes, namely, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions, and discourse adverbials. As in the PDTB, we take elements belonging to these syntactic classes as discourse connectives when they semantically relate syntactic entitities such as clauses, sentences, sequences of sentences, and nominalizations having an abstract object interpretation i.e., eventualities, possibilities, situations, facts, and propositions (as in Asher, 1993, cf. Webber, et al, 2005). Major departures from the PDTB are, attribution is not annotated, only overt connectives are being annotated, and the nominal arguments of connectives are being annotated where they denote an abstract object. Annotation of implicit connectives is further work. 1.2 The annotation cycle Before the annotation process started, the annotators studied the guidelines, which defined some general principles and illustrated difficult cases. The guidelines were written in a way to allow the annotators enough freedom to reflect their intuitions on the annotations. The annotators were also told to observ</context>

Subordinators take as their second argument a nonfinite clause that contains a genitive marked subject that agrees with the subordinate verb in terms of person and number. The subordinate clause may also be assigned case by the postposition that functions as the connective. The subordinator and its host clause are always adjacent and the subordinate clause may appear s-initially or s-finally. Anaphoric connectives are characterized by an anaphoric element in the phrase and hence they have the ability to access the inference in the prior discourse (Webber, et al 2003). Furthermore, they may take as their first argument text spans that are nonadjacent to the sentence containing the connective (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008).3 As example (1) illustrates, discourse adverbials can be used with connectives from other syntactic classes, e.g. a coordinating conjunction, fakat ‘but’ may be used with sonradan ‘then’, and in accessing its first argument, the discourse adverbial may cross one or more clauses.
