<bodyText confidence="0.999925705882353">
The present study explores the vocal intensity
of turn-initial cue phrases in a corpus of dia-
logues in Swedish. Cue phrases convey rela-
tively little propositional content, but have
several important pragmatic functions. The
majority of these entities are frequently occur-
ring monosyllabic words such as “eh”, “mm”,
“ja”. Prosodic analysis shows that these words
are produced with higher intensity than other
turn-initial words are. In light of these results,
it is suggested that speakers produce these ex-
pressions with high intensity in order to claim
the floor. It is further shown that the difference
in intensity can be measured as a dynamic in-
ter-speaker relation over the course of a dia-
logue using the end of the interlocutor’s previ-
ous turn as a reference point.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99996649122807">
In dialogue, interlocutors produce speech incre-
mentally and on-line as the dialogue progresses.
Articulation can be initiated before the speaker
has a complete plan of what to say (Pechmann,
1989). When speaking, processes at all levels
(e.g. semantic, syntactic, phonologic and articu-
latory) work in parallel to render the utterance.
This processing strategy is efficient, since the
speaker may employ the time devoted to articu-
lating an early part of an utterance to plan the
rest.
Speakers often initiate new turns with cue
phrases – standardized lexical or non-lexical ex-
pressions such as “ehm” “okay”, “yeah”, and
“but” (c.f. Gravano, 2009). Cue phrases (or dis-
course markers) are linguistic devices used to
signal relations between different segments of
speech (for an overview see Fraser, 1996). These
devices convey relatively little propositional con-
tent, but have several important pragmatic func-
tions. For example, these words provide feed-
back and signal how the upcoming utterance re-
lates to previous context. Another important
function is to claim the conversational floor (c.f.
Levinson, 1983).
With these fundamental properties of language
production in mind, it is proposed that turn-initial
cue phrases can be used in spoken dialogue sys-
tems to initiate new turns, allowing the system
additional time to generate a complete response.
This approach was recently explored in a user
study with a dialogue system that generates turn-
initial cue phrases incrementally (Skantze &amp;
Hjalmarsson, in press). Results from this experi-
ment show that an incremental version that used
turn-initial cue phrases had shorter response
times and was rated as more efficient, more po-
lite and better at indicating when to speak than a
non-incremental implementation of the same sys-
tem. The present study carries on this research,
investigating acoustic parameters of turn-initial
cue phrases in order to build a dialogue system
that sounds convincing intonation wise.
Another aim of this study was to explore if the
vocal intensity of the other speaker’s immedi-
ately preceding speech can be used as a reference
point in order to measure intensity as an inter-
speaker relation over the course of a dialogue.
Thus, in addition to measuring overall differ-
ences in intensity, the relative difference between
the first token of a new turn and the last token of
the immediately preceding turn was measured.
This dynamic approach, if proven feasible, al-
lows spoken dialogue system designers to adjust
the system’s vocal intensity on-line in order to
accommodate variations in the surrounding
acoustic environment.

barge-ins are disallowed in particular dialogue
states. Theoretical support for such manipula-
tions is provided by an early line of research on
interruptions in dialogue (Meltzer et al., 1971).
Meltzer et al. (1971) propose that the outcome of
speech overlaps is affected by prosodic charac-
teristics and show that the greater the increase in
amplitude, the greater the likelihood of “interrup-
tion success”. Moreover, it is show that the suc-
cess of interruptions, that is who retains the floor,
is based on how much higher the intensity of the
interruption is compared to the previous
speaker’s intensity or compared to the speaker’s
own intensity at the end of that speaker’s previ-
ous speaker turn.
Measuring inter-speaker relative intensity is
further motivated by research that suggests that
speakers adjust their vocal intensity online over
the course of a dialogue in order to accommodate
the surrounding acoustic context. For example,
speakers tend to raise their voice unintentionally
when background noise increases to enhance
their audibility; this is the so-called Lombard
effect (Pick et al., 1989). Moreover, speakers
adjust intensity based on their conversational
partners (Natale, 1975) and the distance to their
listeners (Healey et al., 1997).

3.1 Data: The DEAL corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935020408164">
DEAL is a dialogue system that is currently be-
ing developed at the department of Speech, Mu-
sic and Hearing, KTH (Wik &amp; Hjalmarsson,
2009). The aim of the DEAL dialogue system is
to provide conversation training for second lan-
guage learners of Swedish. The scene of DEAL
is set at a flea market where a talking animated
persona is the owner of a shop selling used
goods.
The dialogue data used as a basis for the data
analyzes presented in this paper were human-
human dialogues, collected in a recording envi-
ronment set up to mimic the interaction in the
DEAL domain. The dialogue collected were in-
formal, human-human, face-to-face conversation
in Swedish. The recordings were made with
close talk microphones with six subjects (four
male and two female). In total, eight dialogues
were collected. Each dialogue was about 15 min-
utes, making for about two hours of speech in
total in the corpus. The dialogues were tran-
scribed orthographically and annotated for enti-
ties such as laughter, lip-smacks, breathing and
hemming. The transcripts from the dialogues
were time-aligned with the speech signal. This
was done using forced alignment with subse-
quent manual verification of the timings. The
dialogues were also segmented into speaker
turns. A speaker turn here is a segment of speech
of arbitrary length surrounded by another
speaker’s vocalization. All together, the dia-
logues contained 2036 speaker turns.
The corpus was also annotated for cue phrases
using 11 functional categories. The definition of
cue phrases used for annotation of the DEAL
corpus was broad and all types of vocalizations
that the speakers use to hold the dialogue to-
gether at different communicative levels were
included. Cue phrase annotation was designed as
a two-fold task: (i) to decide if a word was a cue
phrase or not – a binary task, and (ii) to select its
functional class according to the annotation
scheme. The annotators could see the transcrip-
tions and listen to the recordings while labelling.
The kappa coefficient for task (i) was 0.87
(p&lt;.05). The kappa coefficient for (ii) was 0.82
(p&lt;.05). For a detailed description of the cue
phrase categories and their annotation, see
(Hjalmarsson, 2008).

3.2 Data analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999786185185185">
The first word in each turn was extracted and
analyzed. Here, a word is all annotated tokens in
the corpus except breathing, lip-smacks, and
laughter, which are all relevant, but outside the
scope of this study. 1137 (57%) words were an-
notated as some type of cue phrase, and 903 (43
%) were other words. The turn-initial cue phrases
were annotated with different cue phrase catego-
ries. 587 (28%) turn-initial words were annotated
as either RESPONSIVE, RESPONSIVE DISPREFER-
ENCE or RESPONSIVE NEW INFORMATION. The
annotation of these was based on the interpreta-
tion of the speakers’ attitudes, expressing either
neutral feedback (RESPONSIVE), non-agreement
(RESPONSIVE DISPREFERENCE) or surprise (RE-
SPONSIVE NEW INFORMATION). The RESPON-
SIVES were most frequently realized as either
“ja”, “a”, and “mm” (Eng: “yeah”, “mm”).
Furthermore, 189 (9%) of all turn-initial words
were annotated as CONNECTIVES. The connective
cue phrase categories indicate how the new ut-
terance relates to previous context. For example,
these signal whether the upcoming speaker turn
is additive, contrastive or alternative to previous
context. Examples of these categories are “och”
(Eng: “and”), “men” (Eng: “but”) and “eller”
(Eng: “or”), respectively.

A third category of cue phrases in a turn-initial
position was filled pauses (57, 3%). Whereas
filled pause may not typically be considered as
cue phrases, these elements have similar charac-
teristics. For example, fillers provide important
pragmatic information that listeners attend and
adjust their behaviour according to. For example,
a corpus study of Dutch fillers showed that these
tokens highlight discourse structure (Swertz,
1998). Frequently occurring filler words in the
corpus were “eh” and “ehm”.
The majority of the turn-initial cue phrases
were high frequency monosyllabic words, which
are typically not associated with stress, although
on listening, they give the impression of being
louder than other turn-initial vocalizations. To
verify this observation, the intensity in decibel of
the first word of each turn was extracted using
Snack (www.speech.kth.se/snack). In order to
explore the vocal intensity as an inter-speaker
relation over the course of the dialogue, the aver-
age intensity of the last word of all turns was
extracted. The motivation of this approach is to
use the previous speaker’s voice intensity as a
reference point. Thus, in order to avoid the need
for global analysis over speakers and dialogues,
only the (un-normalized) difference in intensity
between the last word of the immediately preced-
ing turn and the first word of a new turn was cal-
culated.
All turns following a one word only turn from
the other speaker were excluded as an approxi-
mation to avoid speech following backchannel
responses. 300 (33%) of the speaker changes
contained overlapping speech. These overlaps
were excluded from the data analysis since the
recordings were not completely channel-
separated and crosstalk could conceivably inter-
fere with the results.
Since the distance between the lips and the
microphone was not controlled for during the
recordings, the values were first normalized per
speaker and dialogue (each value was shifted by
the mean value per speaker and dialogue).

significant difference in intensity between turns
initiated with cue phrases (M=3.20 dB, SD=6.99)
and turns initiated with other words (M=-4.20

these consist of high frequency monosyllabic
words such as “yes”, “mm” and “okay”. The
most frequent turn-initial words that were not
annotated as cue phrases were “den” (Eng: “it”),
“vad” (Eng: “what”), and “jag” (Eng: “I”). Thus,
similar to turn-initial cue phrases, this category
contains high-frequency monosyllabic words,
items that are not typically associated with pro-
sodic stress. Yet, the results show that turn-initial
cue phrases are produced with higher intensity
than other turn-initial words are. In the light of
previous research, which suggests that increased
intensity have turn-claiming functions, one can
speculate that speakers produce talkspurt-initial
cue phrases with increased intensity in order to
claim the floor convincingly before having for-
mulated a complete utterance.
It is further argued that turn-initial cue phrases
can be used in dialogue systems capable of in-
cremental speech production. Such words can be
used to initiate turns once the user has stopped
speaking, allowing the system more time to
process input without response delays.
Finally, it is suggested that intensity may be
better modelled relative to the intensity of the
immediately preceding speech rather than in ab-
solute of speaker-normalized terms. Speakers
adjust their intensity to the current acoustical
environment, and such a dynamic inter-speaker
relative model may accommodate the current
acoustic context over the course of a dialogue. In
support of this approach, the present study shows
that the increase in intensity can be calculated
dynamically over the dialogue using the end of
the previous speaker’s turn as a reference point.
Inter-speaker relative measures are also moti-
vated practically. Extracting objective measures
of intensity is problematic since contextual fac-
tors such as the distance between the microphone
and the lips are difficult to control between dia-
logues and speakers, but the effects are mitigated
by dynamic and relative measures. This is not to
say that measuring intensity over the course of a
single dialogue is trivial. Variation due to for
example unforeseen alterations of the distance
between the lips and the microphone during the
dialogue are still problematic, but it is less of a
problem within a session than between different
sessions.

Gravano, 2009). Cue phrases (or discourse markers) are linguistic devices used to signal relations between different segments of speech (for an overview see Fraser, 1996). These devices convey relatively little propositional content, but have several important pragmatic functions. For example, these words provide feedback and signal how the upcoming utterance relates to previous context. Another important function is to claim the conversational floor (c.f. Levinson, 1983). With these fundamental properties of language production in mind, it is proposed that turn-initial cue phrases can be used in spoken dialogue systems to initiate new turns, allowing the system additional time to generate a complete response. This approach was recently explored in a user study with a dialogue system that generates turninitial cue phrases incrementally (Skantze &amp; Hjalmarsson, in press). Results from this experiment show that an incremental version that used turn-initial cue phrases had shorter response times and was rated as more efficient, more polite and better at indicating</context>

In light of these results, it is suggested that speakers produce these expressions with high intensity in order to claim the floor. It is further shown that the difference in intensity can be measured as a dynamic inter-speaker relation over the course of a dialogue using the end of the interlocutor’s previous turn as a reference point. 1 Introduction In dialogue, interlocutors produce speech incrementally and on-line as the dialogue progresses. Articulation can be initiated before the speaker has a complete plan of what to say (Pechmann, 1989). When speaking, processes at all levels (e.g. semantic, syntactic, phonologic and articulatory) work in parallel to render the utterance. This processing strategy is efficient, since the speaker may employ the time devoted to articulating an early part of an utterance to plan the rest. Speakers often initiate new turns with cue phrases – standardized lexical or non-lexical expressions such as “ehm” “okay”, “yeah”, and “but” (c.f. Gravano, 2009).

Thus, in addition to measuring overall differences in intensity, the relative difference between the first token of a new turn and the last token of the immediately preceding turn was measured. This dynamic approach, if proven feasible, allows spoken dialogue system designers to adjust the system’s vocal intensity on-line in order to accommodate variations in the surrounding acoustic environment. 2 Related work There are a few examples of research that have manipulated intensity to signal pragmatic functions.

Examples of these categories are “och” (Eng: “and”), “men” (Eng: “but”) and “eller” (Eng: “or”), respectively. 226 A third category of cue phrases in a turn-initial position was filled pauses (57, 3%). Whereas filled pause may not typically be considered as cue phrases, these elements have similar characteristics. For example, fillers provide important pragmatic information that listeners attend and adjust their behaviour according to. For example, a corpus study of Dutch fillers showed that these tokens highlight discourse structure (Swertz, 1998). Frequently occurring filler words in the corpus were “eh” and “ehm”. The majority of the turn-initial cue phrases were high frequency monosyllabic words, which are typically not associated with stress, although on listening, they give the impression of being louder than other turn-initial vocalizations. To verify this observation, the intensity in decibel of the first word of each turn was extracted using Snack (www.speech.kth.se/snack). In order to explore the vocal intensity as an inter-speaker relation over the course of the dialogue, the average intensity of the last word of all turns wa</context>
