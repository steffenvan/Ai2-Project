This workshop is the fifth meeting of computational phonologists under the auspices
of SIGPHON. Our goal is to bring together researchers working in different theoretical
frameworks and to advance the understanding of the computational and formal issues of
current approaches to phonology.
Finite-state methods have been used very successfully to model classical phonological
descriptions based on rewrite rules. It was C. Douglas Johnson (1972) who apparently first
realized that phonological derivations could be modeled as a finite-state transduction in which
each rule represents a regular relation between the input and the output languages. This is also
the fundamental insight of Koskenniemi&apos;s two-level morphology (1983).
Although the rhetoric of Optimality Theory suggests that OT is fundamentally
different from old-fashioned &amp;quot;serial&amp;quot; approaches to phonological description, there are many
similarities. Ellison (1994) was the first to provide a computational account of OT using
finite-state automata. In later works, it has been widely assumed that GEN is a regular
relation. Many of the constraints that have been proposed in the OT literature can be
formalized as a simple finite-state automaton or as an input-output transducer as in the two-
level model.
However desirable it might be from a computational point of view, it is by no means
evident that OT can be reduced to yet another way of encoding regular relations, except by
limiting the number of violations that need to be counted and by restricting the type of
allowable constraints. The question of what will turn out to be the appropriate way to model
OT computationally is very much open at this point. Three of the papers in this volume
address this very issue.
One of the reasons why OT appears to go beyond the finite-state domain is that much
of the &amp;quot;cutting-edge&amp;quot; OT work in phonology deals with phenomena such as reduplication that
were not considered as central in the earlier times. In this domain the distinction between
phonology and morphology becomes blurred. Two of the papers in this volume address this
topic, from very different points of view.
We thank our dedicated reviewers who enabled us to bring together the papers for
these proceedings. We hope that you enjoy the workshop!

A new finite-state technique, &amp;quot;compile-replace&amp;quot;, lets a regular expression compiler
reapply and modify its own output, freeing morphotactic description to use any finite-
state operation. This provides an elegant solution for classic examples of non-
concatenative phenomena in Malay and Arabic.

A simple version of the automatic constraint ranking problem is easier than previously
known (linear on the number of constraints). But slightly more realistic versions are
as bad as Σ2-complete. Even checking a ranking against data is up to Δ2-complete.
Approximation and Exactness in Finite State Optimality Theory
Dale Gerdemann and Gertjan van Noord
Frank &amp; Satta (1998) showed that OT with gradient constraints generally is not finite-
state. We present an improvement of the approximation of Karttunen (1998). The
new method is exact and compact for the syllabification analysis of Prince and
Smolensky (1993).

Daniel M. Albro
Extends the Primitive Optimality Theory formalism (Eisner 1997) to handle
reduplication. Each candidate set becomes a Multiple Context-Free Language.
Constraints, however, remain finite-state. Efficient candidate filtering is possible via
an extended Earley&apos;s algorithm.
