<bodyText confidence="0.9999066875">
The PUNDIT system processes natural
language descriptions of situations and the inter-
vals over which they hold using an algorithm that
integrates aspect and tense logic. It analyses the
tense and aspect of the main verb to generate
representations of three types of situations—
states, processes and events— and to locate the
situations with respect to the time at which the
text was produced. Each situation type has a dis-
tinct temporal structure, represented in terms of
one or more intervals. Further, every interval has
two features whose different values capture the
aspectual differences between the three different
situation types. Capturing these differences makes
it possible to represent very precisely the times for
which predications are asserted to hold.

This paper describes a semantics of situa-
tions and the intervals over which they hold
that is neither situation semantics (Barwise and
Perry, 1983) nor interval semantics (Dowty, 1979,
1982, 1986; Taylor, 1977). It is unfortunately
difficult to avoid the overlap in terminology
because what will be described here shares certain
goals and assumptions with each. The concerns
addressed here, however, arise from the computa-
tional task of processing references to situations in
natural language text in order to represent what
predicates are asserted to hold over what entities
and when.

The PUNDIT text-processing system&apos; processes
references to situations using an algorithm that
integrates tense logic (Reichenbach, 1947) with
aspect, or what Talmy (1985) calls the-pattern -of--

structure of three types of situations, namely
states, processes and events, and how these
situations are located in time.

2. Problems in Computing Appropriate
Representations

<bodyText confidence="0.998509777777778">
The critical problems in the semantic
analysis of references to situations and their
associated times are: 1) language encodes
several different kinds of temporal information, 2)
this information is distributed in many distinct
linguistic elements, and finally, 3) the semantic
contribution of many of these elements is
context-dependent and cannot be computed
without looking at co-occurring elements.

&apos;PUNDIT is an acronym for Prolog UNderstands and In-
tegrates Text. It is a modular system, implemented in
Quintus Prolog, with distinct syntactic, semantic and prag-
matic components (cf. Dahl et al., 1987).

These problems have been addressed as fol-
lows. A decision was made to focus on the kinds
of temporal information embodied in the verb and
its categories of tense, taxis4 and grammatical
aspect,5 and to temporarily ignore other kinds of
temporal information.5 Computation of this infor-
mation was then divided into two relatively
independent tasks, with appropriate information
passed between the modules performing these
tasks in order to accommodate context-
dependencies. The first task, carried out by
Module 1, makes use of the aspectual information
in the verb phrase (lexical and grammatical
aspect) to determine the situation type being
referred to and its temporal structure. An abstract
component of temporal structure, referred to as
the event time (following Reichenbach, 1947),
serves as input to Module 2, where the deictic
information in the verb phrase (tense and taxis) is
used to compute temporal ordering relations, i.e.,
where the situation is located with respect to the
time of text production. Section §3 outlines the
general goals for computing temporal structure
and §4 describes in detail how it is computed.
Then §5 briefly illustrates how the event time
which Module 1 passes to Module 2 simplifies the
interaction of tense and aspect.

3. Goals for Representing Situations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999705734693877">
The goal in generating representations of the
temporal structure of situations was to closely
link the times at which situations are said to hold
with the lexical decompositions of the predicates
used in referring to them. The decompositions
encode aspectual information about the situation
types which is used in determining what type of
situation has been referred to and what its tem-
poral structure is. Distinct components of the
semantic decompositions correspond to different
features of the intervals with which they are asso-
ciated. As §4 will demonstrate, the interpretation
of these components of temporal meaning depends
on the interaction between lexical and grammati-
cal aspect.
(Jakobson, 1957) refers to the semantic effect of
the presence or absence of the perfect auxiliary.
&apos;Aspect is both part of the inherent meaning of a verb
(lexical aspect) and also signalled by the presence or absence
of the progressive suffix -ing (grammatical aspect).
rate (given by adverbs like rapidly), &amp;quot;patterns of
frequency or habituation&amp;quot;, and so on (cf. Mourelatos, 1981).
This approach to the compositional seman-
tics of temporal reference is similar in spirit to
interval semantics. Interval semantics captures
the distinct temporal properties of situations by
specifying a truth conditional relation between
a full sentence and a unique interval (Dowty,
1979, 1986). This is motivated by the observa-
tion that the aspectual type of a sentence
depends simultaneously on the aspectual class of
a particular lexical item, its tense, taxis and
grammatical aspect, and the nature of its argu-
ments (cf. Mourelatos, 1981; note that the
latter factor is not handled here).
The goal of PUNDIT&apos;s temporal analysis is
not simply to sort references to situations into
states, processes and events, but more specifically
to represent the differences between the three
types of situations by considering in detail the
characteristics of the set of temporal intervals that
they hold or occur over (Allen, 1983, p. 132). Thus,
instead of specifying truth conditional properties
of sentences, the temporal semantics outlined here
specifies what property of an interval is entailed
by what portion of the input sentence, and then
compositionally constructs a detailed representa-
tion of a state, process or event from the inter-
vals and their associated properties.

8.1. Intervals and Their Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.937603454545455">
Each situation type has a distinct temporal
structure comprised of the interval or intervals
over which it holds. Two features are associated
with each interval, kinesis and boundedness.
Very briefly, kinesis pertains to the internal
structure of an interval, or in informal terms,
whether something is happening within the inter-
val. Boundedness pertains to the way in which
an interval is located in time with respect to other
times, e.g., whether it is bounded by another inter-
val.
4. Part One of the Algorithm: Computing
Temporal Structure
The input used to compute the temporal
structure of a situation consists of the grammati-
cal aspect of the verb, that is, whether it is pro-
gressive, and the decomposition produced by
PUNDIT&apos;s semantic interpreter (Palmer et al.,
1986). The lexical decompositions employed by
PUNDIT (Passonneau, 1986b) not only represent
the predicate/argument structure of verbs, but in
addition, following the example of Dowty&apos;s aspect

calculus (1979), they represent a verb&apos;s inherent
temporal properties, or lexical aspect.7 In
PUNDIT&apos;s lexical entries, there are three values of
lexical aspect corresponding to the three types of
situations. Four of the six possible combinations
of grammatical and lexical aspect are temporally
distinct. This section will go through the four
cases one by one.

4.1. States

<bodyText confidence="0.999119">
The following conditional statement sum-
marises the first of four cases of temporal struc-
ture. The antecedent specifies the necessary input
condition, the first clause of the consequent
specifies the situation type, the second specifies
the kinesis of its associated interval and the third
specifies its boundedness.

<bodyText confidence="0.988823518987342">
As shown here, if the lexical aspect of a predica-
tion is stative, its grammatical aspect is
irrelevant. The justification for ignoring grammat-
ical aspect in the context of lexical stativity
appears at the end of this section.
A state is defined as a situation which holds
for some interval that is both static and
unbounded. Example 1) illustrates a typical
reference to a state situation along with its
semantic decomposition. Note that the lexical
head of the verb phrase is the adjective low.
1) The pressure was low.
low (patient( [pressurel])8
As in Dowty&apos;s aspect calculus (1979), the decompo-
sitions of stative predicates consist of semantic
predicates with no aspectual operators or Connec-
tives. Computing the temporal structure associ-
ated with 1) means finding a single interval with
the appropriate features of kinesis and bounded-
ness to associate with the stative predicate
low (patient(X)).
7The literature on aspectual classes of verbs provides a
variety of diagnostics for determining the inherent aspect of
verbs (cf. Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979).
&apos;PUNDIT&apos;. current application is to process short
messages texts called CASREPS (CASualty REPorts) which
describe Navy equipment failures. The arguments in the
decompositions, e.g., (pressure/I, are unique identifiers of the
entities denoted by the surface noun phrases. They are crest-
Kinesis of states. A static interval is tem-
porally homogeneous. With respect to the relevant
predication, there is no change within the interval;
consequently, any subinterval is equivalent to any
other subinterval. Thus, a static interval is
defined much as stative predications are defined in
interval semantics:
An interval I associated with some predication 11) is
static if it follows from the truth of tb at I that tb is
true at all subintervals of I (cf. Dowty, 1986, p. 42).
Situations are represented as predicates identify-
ing the situation type (e.g., state). The situation
denoted by 1) would be represented as follows:
statealow11,
low (patient apressure7D,
period ([low11)
The three arguments are: the unique identifier of
the situation (e.g., [lowl]), the semantic decompo-
sition, and the time argument (e.g., period
alow1D). The same symbol (e.g.,[lowl]) identifies
both the situation and its time argument because
it is the actual time for which a situation holds
which uniquely identifies it.° A period time argu-
ment in the context of a state predicate always
represents a static interval.
Boundedness of states. The intervals asso-
ciated with states are inherently unbounded. A
temporal bound can be provided by an appropri-
ate temporal adverbial (e.g., The pressure was nor-
mal mita the pump seize d),1° but here we consider
only the temporal semantics specified by the verb
form itself. When an unbounded interval is
located with respect to a particular point in time,
it is assumed to extend indefinitely in both direc-
tions around that time. In 1), at least part of the
interval for which the predication
low(patientapressurei.D) is asserted to hold is
located in the past. However, this interval may or
may not end prior to the present. The unbounded
property of the interval can be illustrated more
precisely by examining the relationship between
the predication and the temporal adverbial
ed by PUNDIT&apos;s reference resolution component (Dahl, 1986).
&apos;Though a situation is something quite different for Bar-
wise and Perry (1983), they take a similar view of the role of a
particular space-time location in tokenising a situation type
(cf. esp. pp. 51ff).
Inn general, temporal adverbial. can modify an existing
component of temporal structure or add components of tem-
poral structure.

modifying it in example 2):
2) The pressure was low at 08:00.
This sentence asserts that the state of
low(patientapressurelp) holds at 08:00 and
possibly prior and subsequent to 08:00. That is,
the sentence would be true if the pressure were
low for only an instant coincident with 08:00, but
it is not asserted to hold only for that instant.
This is captured by defining the interval as
unbounded.
A situation representation does not itself
indicate the boundedness of its period time
argument. Instead, this feature is passed as a
parameter to the component which interprets
tense and taxis (cf. §5).
As will be shown in the following section, the
progressive assigns the features active and
unbounded to non-stative verbs. But with sta-
tive verbs, the progressive contributes no temporal
information. Inability to occur with the progres-
sive has in fact been cited as a diagnostic test of
statives, but as Dowty notes (1979), there is a
class of progressives which denotes locative states
(e.g., The socks are lying under the bed). Such sta-
tives occur in PUNDIT&apos;s current application
domain in examples like the following sentence
fragment:

A complete discussion of the interaction between
progressive grammatical aspect and stative lexical
aspect would have to address cases in which the
progressive contributes non-temporal information
(cf. Smith, 1983). However, these issues are not
pertinent to the computation of temporal struc-
ture.

active intervals of time.11 Active intervals can be
unbounded or unspecified for boundedness,
depending on the grammatical aspect of the predi-
cation. The two possible temporal structures asso-
ciated with processes are discussed in this and the
following section.
Example 4) illustrates a typical predication
denoting a temporally unbounded process
along with its semantic decomposition.
4) The alarm was sounding.
D 0 (sound(actor ( Ealarm41)))
DO is an aspectual operator identifying a decom-
position as a process predicate (cf. Dowty, 1979).12
As with statives, computing the temporal struc-
ture for sentences like 4) involves finding a single
interval to associate with the semantic decomposi-
tion.
Kinesis of processes. The presence of a DO
operator in a decomposition indicates that the
interval for which it holds must be active. Active
and static intervals contrast in that change
occurs within an active interval with respect to
the relevant predication. For example, for any
interval for which DO(sound(actoraalarm4D))
is true, the [alarm4] participant must undergo
changes that qualify as sounding, and must con-
tinue to do so throughout the interval. As Moure-
latos (1981) has pointed out, process predicates
vary regarding how narrowly one can subdivide
such intervals and still recognise the same process.
Dowty has used this threshold of granularity as
the defining characteristic of process sentences,
and it is borrowed here to define active intervals:
An interval I associated with some predication tk is
active if it follows from the truth of tk at I that 11, is
true at all subintervals of I down to a certain limit
in size.
As the process representation for 4) illustrates,
processes and states are represented similarly.

&apos;The distinction between static and active intervals is
useful for interpreting manner adverbial. indicating rate of
change. Since stative predications denote the absence of
change over time, they cannot be modified by rate adverbial..
1213ecause the aspectual operator DO always has an ac-
tor semantic role associated with it, PUNDIT&apos;s semantic
decompositions actually omit DO and use the presence of the
actor role to identify process predicates.

The situation predicate identifies the situation
type as a process. Note that a period time
argument in the context of a process predicate
indicates an active interval.
The rule given above specifies that transi-
tion event verbs in the progressive also denote
temporally unbounded processes (cf. 5).
5) The engineer is installing the oil filter.
cause (D 0 (install (agent([engineer 3]))),
BECOME(installed(themeafilter41),
location(X))))
The cause predicate in the decomposition of
install indicates that it is a causative verb, and
the BECOME operator that its lexical aspect is
transition event. This aspectual class is a hetero-
geneous one, but in general, transition event
verbs are temporally more complex than stative or
process verbs, and have a correspondingly more
complex relation between their semantic decompo-
sitions and temporal structure. Consequently, the
discussion of the treatment of progressive transi-
tion event verbs is postponed until after the func-
tion of the aspectual operator BECOME has been
explained.
Boundeciness. In 6), the interval associated
with the alarm sounding is unbounded. It bears
the same relationship to the at adverbial phrase
modifying the predication as does the static inter-
val in 2) above, repeated here as 7).
6) The alarm was sounding at 08:00.
7) The pressure was low at 08:00.
This similarity between statives and progressives
has led Vlach (1981) to identify them with each
other. Here, the commonality among sentences like
1), 2), 4) and 6) is captured by associating the
feature value unbounded both with stative lexi-
cal aspect and with progressive grammatical
aspect. The differences between the predications
in 6) and 7), which show up in the types of
modification and anaphoric processes to which
such predications are susceptible, are encapsulated
in their contrasting values of kinesis (cf. fn. 11
above).

The third case of temporal structure
accounts for the differences between sentences like
4), having a process verb in the progressive, and
8), where the process verb is non-progressive.
8) The alarm sounded.
The differences, which will be explained below, are
captured in the following rule indicating that the
active interval for which the predication is said to

Again, the parameter indicating that the interval
associated with 8) is unspecified gets passed to
Module 2 which interprets tense and taxis. In
every other respect, the analysis of the temporal
structure associated with 8) resembles that for 4).
A comparison of progressive and non-
progressive process verbs in the context of an at
adverbial phrase illustrates the relative indeter-
minacy of the non-progressive use. In the context
of the progressive process verb in 6), the clock
time is interpreted as falling within the active
interval of sounding but in 9), where the verb is
not progressive, 08:00 can be interpreted as falling
at the inception of the process or as roughly locat-
ing the entire process.

Non-progressive process verbs exhibit a wide vari-
ation with respect to what part of the temporal
structure is located by tense (Passonneau, 1986a).
The influencing factors seem to be pragmatic in
nature, rather than semantic. The solution taken
here is to characterise the event time of such
predications as having an unspecified relation to
the active interval associated with the denoted

A transition event is a complex situation consist-
ing of a process which culminates in a transition
to a new state or process. Its temporal structure
is thus an active interval followed by—and
bounded by—a new active or static interval.
The new state or process comes into being as a
result of the initial process-13
As in Dowty (1986), both Vendler&apos;s achieve-
ments and his accomplishments collapse into one
class, viz., transition events. That is, achieve-
ments
are those kinesis predicates which are not only typi-
cally of shorter duration than accomplishments, but
also those which we do not normally understand as
entailing a sequence of sub-events, given our usual
every-day criteria for identifying the events
named by the predicate (Dowty, 1986, p. 43).
Causative verbs, in which the action of one parti-
cipant results in a change in another participant,
are typical accomplishment verbs.
10) The pump sheared the drive shaft.
cause (D 0 (shear (agent ([puznp61))),
BE C OME (sheared(patient([shaft81))))
Sentence 10) asserts that a process in which the
pump participated (shearing) caused a change in
the drive shaft (being sheared). Note that the
decomposition explicitly indicates a causal relation
between two conjoined predicates, one represent-
ing an activity perfomed by an agent, and the
other representing the resulting situation.
BECOME serves as the aspectual operator for
marking transition event decompositions. The
argument to BECOME constitutes the semantic
decomposition of the new state or process arising
at the culmination of the event.
Non-causative verbs can also denote transi-
tion events. With inchoatives, the same entity
participates in both the initial process and the
resulting situation denoted by the predication.
11) The engine failed.
DO(fail(agent([engine11))),
BE C OME (fal led(patientaenginelp))
In 11), an engine is said to participate in some
process (failing) which culminates in a new state
being inoperative). The semantic
&amp;quot;A state may be a necessary precondition for a certain
change to occur, but since states are defined by the absence of
change, or negative klnesis, they are inherently incapable of
generating new situations.
decompositions used in PUNDIT do not explicitly
represent the initial processes involved in transi-
tion events because they are completely predict-
able from the presence of the BECOME operator.
But both conjuncts are shown here to illustrate
that computing the temporal structure of a transi-
tion event situation requires finding two intervals,
one associated with the initial process predicate
(e.g., DO(fall(agentaenginelp))) and the other
with the predicate for the resulting situation (e.g.,
failed(patient([engine11))).
As indicated in the rule for this case, the
temporal structure also includes a moment of
transition between the two intervals, i.e., its tran-
sition bound. Since a transition event is one
which results in a new situation, there is in theory
a point in time before which the new situation
does not exist and subsequent to which it does. A
transition bound is a theoretical construct not
intended to correspond to an empirically deter-
mined time. In fact, it should be thought of as the
same kind of boundary between intervals implied
by Allen&apos;s meets relation (Allen, 1983; 1984, esp.
p. 128). However, it is a convenient abstraction for
representing how transition events are perceived
and talked about.
We can now return to the question of the
interpretation of progressive transition event
verbs. In the context of a decomposition with a
BECOME operator, the progressive is con-
strained to apply to the predicate corresponding
to the initial process, i.e., the predicate denoting
the portion of a transition event prior to the
moment of transition. Computing the temporal
structure for the progressive of install in 12), for
example, involves generating a single active,
unbounded interval for which the predication
D 0 (agent ( [engineer 8])) holds:
12) The engineer is installing the oil filter.
cause (D 0 (agent( (engineer 31),
BECOME(installed(themeafilter4D,
location(X)))))
In this context, the remainder of the semantic
decomposition denotes what the person reporting
on the event assumes to be the eventual culmina-
tion of the process referred to as installing.
Kinesis. Examples 13) and 14) illustrate two
types of transition events, one resulting in a new

Temporal Ordering Relations

PUNDIT employs a Reichenbachian analysis
of tense which temporally locates situations in
terms of three abstract times: the time of the
situation (event time), the time of speech/text
production (speech time), and the time with
&amp;quot;At present, PUNDIT explicitly represents only two
components of transition event predications: the moment as-
sociated with an event of becoming, and a period associated
with a resulting situation. This representation has been found
to be adequate for the current application. The omission of
the first interval is purely a matter of practical convenience,
but could easily be represented should the need arise.
respect to which relational adverbials are inter-
preted (reference time). Reichenbach (1947) did
not distinguish between the temporal structure of
a situation and its event time. In PUNDIT,
event time is a carefully defined abstract com-
ponent of temporal structure in terms of which
ordering relations are specified. It is determined
on the basis of boundedness, and is always
represented as a dimensionless moment.

The three values of boundedness outlined
above correspond to three possible relations of
event time to a time argument. Examples 16)
through 18) illustrate these relations. If an inter-
val is unbounded, its event time is represented
as an arbitrary moment included within the
period time argument:
16) The pressure is low.
Boundedness: unbounded
Event time: MI such that

For an interval unspecified for boundedness the
event time kiss a non-committal relation to the
interval, i.e., it may be an endpoint of or included
within the period time argument:
17) The alarm sounded.
Boundedness: unspecified
Event time: M1 such that

The moment time argument of a transition event
is ideatiesl to its event time. Identity, or the lack
of referential distinctness, is handled through Pro-
log unification.

Defining these three different relations of event
time to temporal structure simplifies the computa-
tion of the ordering relations given by the perfect
and non-perfect tenses.

The rules for the past and present tenses are quite
simple. They locate the event time as coincident

the Report Time):

These two rules in combination with the different
relations of event time to the temporal structures
of situations makes it possible to capture impor-
tant facts about the interaction of tense and
aspect. For example, present tense denotes an
actual time only when applied to unbounded
intervals. Thus a reference to an actual situation
is computed for sentences like 19) but not 20).
19) The engine is failing.
20) The engine fails.
In 20), the present tense pertains not to a specific
event of engine failure, but rather to the ten-
dency for this type of situation to recur.
A predication denoting a past unbounded
situation can be followed by a predication assert-
ing the continuation or cessation of the same
situation:
21) The pump was operating at 08:00 and is still
operating.
A single interval would be generated for the two
clauses in 21). However, a similar assertion follow-
ing a predication with a transition event verb in
the simple past is contradictory if still is inter-
preted as indicating persistence of the same
event.15
22) ?The pump sheared the drive shaft and is
still shearing it.
The event time for the first conjunct in 22) is a
moment necessarily culminating in a new situa-
tion (i.e., a state of being sheared). Since the
transition bound is dimensionless, the adverb still
cannot refer to its persistence. A predication

context can be interpreted analogously to either
21) or 22):
23) The pump operated at 08:00 and is still
operating.
The non-committal relation of event time to tem-
poral structure for unspecified intervals makes
both interpretations of 23) possible, and selecting
among them is undoubtedly a pragmatic task
rather than a semantic one. As we will see next,
the utility of distinguishing between unbounded
and unspecified process predications is especially
apparent in the context of temporal adverbials.

The representations described above were
inspired by remarks found in the literature on
tense and aspect to the effect that the time ache-
mats (\readier, 1967) associated with different
situations are crucial to the way we perceive and
talk about them. One of the crucial types of evi-
dence used in deriving PUNDIT&apos;s temporal seman-
tics as the interpretation of temporal adverbials in
different contexts (Passonneau, 1986a). Conse-
quently, one of the advantages to the representa-
tions is that they make it possible to tailor the
interpretation of a temporal adverb to the tem-
poral structure of the modified situation.
For example, specifying a different relation
for the event time of an active interval, depend-
ing on its boundedness, yields different temporal
relations between the situations described in sen-
tences like 24-26), as shown informally in the
examples.
24) The pump failed when the engine was rotat-
ing.
transition of failure during period of rotation
25) The pump failed when the engine rotated.
transition of failure during
OR at one endpoint of period of rotation
26) The engine rotated when the pump failed.
Same as 25)
Sentences like 25) and 26) are often interpreted
with the process (e.g., rotation) beginning at or
after the transition event moment (e.g., failure).
PUNDIT&apos;s representations of the temporal seman-
tics of predications are explicit enough yet
sufficiently non-committal to provide suitable
input to a pragmatic reasoner that could decide
these cases.

It is a modular system, implemented in Quintus Prolog, with distinct syntactic, semantic and pragmatic components (cf. Dahl et al., 1987). 16 These problems have been addressed as follows. A decision was made to focus on the kinds of temporal information embodied in the verb and its categories of tense, taxis4 and grammatical aspect,5 and to temporarily ignore other kinds of temporal information.5 Computation of this information was then divided into two relatively independent tasks, with appropriate information passed between the modules performing these tasks in order to accommodate contextdependencies.

Mourelatos, 1981). This approach to the compositional semantics of temporal reference is similar in spirit to interval semantics. Interval semantics captures the distinct temporal properties of situations by specifying a truth conditional relation between a full sentence and a unique interval (Dowty, 1979, 1986). This is motivated by the observation that the aspectual type of a sentence depends simultaneously on the aspectual class of a particular lexical item, its tense, taxis and grammatical aspect, and the nature of its arguments (cf. Mourelatos, 1981; note that the latter factor is not handled here).

As §4 will demonstrate, the interpretation of these components of temporal meaning depends on the interaction between lexical and grammatical aspect. (Jakobson, 1957) refers to the semantic effect of the presence or absence of the perfect auxiliary. &apos;Aspect is both part of the inherent meaning of a verb (lexical aspect) and also signalled by the presence or absence of the progressive suffix -ing (grammatical aspect). rate (given by adverbs like rapidly), &amp;quot;patterns of frequency or habituation&amp;quot;, and so on (cf. Mourelatos, 1981). This approach to the compositional semantics of temporal reference is similar in spirit to interval semantics. Interval semantics captures the distinct temporal properties of situations by specifying a truth conditional relation between a full sentence and a unique interval (Dowty, 1979, 1986). This is motivated by the observation that the aspectual type of a sentence depends simultaneously on the aspectual class of a particular lexical item, its tense, taxis and grammatical aspect, and the nature of its arguments (cf. Mourelatos, 1981; note that the latter factor is not handled here). The g</context>

Kinesis of processes. The presence of a DO operator in a decomposition indicates that the interval for which it holds must be active. Active and static intervals contrast in that change occurs within an active interval with respect to the relevant predication. For example, for any interval for which DO(sound(actoraalarm4D)) is true, the [alarm4] participant must undergo changes that qualify as sounding, and must continue to do so throughout the interval. As Mourelatos (1981) has pointed out, process predicates vary regarding how narrowly one can subdivide such intervals and still recognise the same process. Dowty has used this threshold of granularity as the defining characteristic of process sentences, and it is borrowed here to define active intervals: An interval I associated with some predication tk is active if it follows from the truth of tk at I that 11, is true at all subintervals of I down to a certain limit in size. As the process representation for 4) illustrates, processes and states are represented similarly. processasound3], low (patientaalarm71), p</context>

The first task, carried out by Module 1, makes use of the aspectual information in the verb phrase (lexical and grammatical aspect) to determine the situation type being referred to and its temporal structure. An abstract component of temporal structure, referred to as the event time (following Reichenbach, 1947), serves as input to Module 2, where the deictic information in the verb phrase (tense and taxis) is used to compute temporal ordering relations, i.e., where the situation is located with respect to the time of text production. Section §3 outlines the general goals for computing temporal structure and §4 describes in detail how it is computed. Then §5 briefly illustrates how the event time which Module 1 passes to Module 2 simplifies the interaction of tense and aspect. 3.

Reichenbach (1947) did not distinguish between the temporal structure of a situation and its event time. In PUNDIT, event time is a carefully defined abstract component of temporal structure in terms of which ordering relations are specified. It is determined on the basis of boundedness, and is always represented as a dimensionless moment. 5.1. Event Time The three values of boundedness outlined above correspond to three possible relations of event time to a time argument. Examples 16) through 18) illustrate these relations.

Each situation type has a distinct temporal structure, represented in terms of one or more intervals. Further, every interval has two features whose different values capture the aspectual differences between the three different situation types. Capturing these differences makes it possible to represent very precisely the times for which predications are asserted to hold. 1. Introduction This paper describes a semantics of situations and the intervals over which they hold that is neither situation semantics (Barwise and Perry, 1983) nor interval semantics (Dowty, 1979, 1982, 1986; Taylor, 1977). It is unfortunately difficult to avoid the overlap in terminology because what will be described here shares certain goals and assumptions with each. The concerns addressed here, however, arise from the computational task of processing references to situations in natural language text in order to represent what predicates are asserted to hold over what entities and when.
