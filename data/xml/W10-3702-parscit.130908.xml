The morphosyntactic treatment of multi-
word units is particularly challenging in
morphologically rich languages. We
present a comparative study of two for-
malisms meant for lexicalized description
of MWUs in Polish. We show their ex-
pressive power and describe encoding ex-
periments, involving novice and expert
lexicographers, and allowing to evaluate
the accuracy and efficiency of both imple-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841631578947">
Multi-word units (MWU) are linguistic objects
placed between morphology and syntax: their
general syntactic behavior makes them similar to
free phrases, while some of their idiosyncratic
(notably from the morphological point of view)
properties call for a lexicalized approach in which
they are treated as units of description. Moreover,
MWUs, which encompass such classes as com-
pounds, complex terms, multi-word named enti-
ties, etc., often have unique and constant refer-
ences, thus they are seen as semantically rich ob-
jects in Natural Language Processing (NLP) ap-
plications such as information retrieval. One of
the main problems here is the conflation of dif-
ferent surface realizations of the same underlying
concept by the proper treatment of orthographic
(head word vs. headword), morphological (man
servant vs. men servants), syntactic (birth date
vs. birth of date), semantic (hereditary disease
vs. genetic disease) and pragmatic (Prime minis-
ter vs. he) variants (Jacquemin, 2001).
In this paper we are mainly interested in or-
thographic, morphological, and partially syntactic
variants of contiguous MWUs (i.e. not admitting
insertions of external elements). Describing them
properly is particularly challenging in morpholog-
ically rich languages, such as Slavic ones.
We believe that the proper treatment of MWUs
in this context calls for a computational approach
which must be, at least partially, lexicalized,
i.e. based on electronic lexicons, in which MWUs
are explicitly described. Corpus-based machine
learning approaches bring interesting complemen-
tary robustness-oriented solutions. However taken
alone, they can hardly cope with the following im-
portant phenomenon: while MWUs represent a
high percentage of items in natural language texts,
most of them, taken separately, appear very rarely
in corpora. For instance, (Baldwin and Villavi-
cencio, 2002) experimented with a random sam-
ple of two hundred English verb-particle construc-
tions and showed that as many as two thirds of
them appear at most three times in the Wall Street
Journal corpus. The variability of MWUs is an-
other challenge to knowledge-poor methods, since
basic techniques such as lemmatisation or stem-
ming of all corpus words, result in overgeneral-
izations (e.g. customs office vs. *custom office)
or in overlooking of exceptions (e.g. passersby).
Moreover, machine learning methods cannot re-
liably be used alone for less resourced languages.
In such cases an efficient annotation of a large cor-
pus needed for machine learning usually requires
the pre-existence of e-lexicons (Savary and Pisko-
rski, 2010).
Despite these drawbacks machine learning al-
lows robustness and a rapid development, while

knowledge-based methods in general have the
reputation of being very labor intensive. In this
paper we try to show how effective tools of the
the latter class can be. We present two formalisms
and tools designed in view of lexicalized MWU
variant description: Multiflex and POLENG. We
discuss their expressivity, mainly with respect to
Polish. We also show their applications and per-
form their qualitative and quantitative compara-

Compounds show complex linguistic properties
including: (i) heterogeneous status of sepa-
rators in the definition of a MWU’s compo-
nent, (ii) morphological agreement between se-
lected components, (iii) morphosyntactic non-
compositionality (exocentricity, irregular agree-
ment, defective paradigms, variability, etc.), (iv)
large sizes of inflection paradigms (e.g. dozens of
forms in Polish). A larger class of verbal multi-
word expressions additionally may show huge
variability in word order and insertion of external
elements.
For instance in the Polish examples below: (1)
requires case-gender-number agreement between
the two first components only, in (2) the compo-
nents agree in case and number but not in gen-
der, (3) admits a variable word order, (4) shows
a depreciative paradigm (no plural), (5) includes
a foreign lexeme inflected in Polish manner, (6)
is characterized by a shift in gender (masculine
animate noun is the head of a masculine human
compound1), and (7) is a foreign compound with
unstable Polish gender (masculine, neuter or non-
masculine plural).

Due to this complex behavior, as well as to a
rich semantic content, MWUs have been a hot
topic in international research for quite a num-
ber of years (Rayson et al., 2010) in the context
of information retrieval and extraction, named en-
tity recognition, text alignment, machine transla-
tion, text categorization, corpus annotation, etc. In
this study we are interested in lexical approaches
to MWUs, i.e. those in which MWUs are ex-
plicitly described on the entry-per-entry basis, in
particular with respect to their morpho-syntax.
Earlier examples of such approaches include lexc
(Karttunen et al., 1992), FASTR (Jacquemin,
2001), HABIL (Alegria et al., 2004), and Mul-
tiflex discussed below. They mainly concentrate
on contiguous nominal and adjectival MWUs,
sometimes considering limited insertions of ex-
ternal elements. More recent approaches, such
as (Villavicencio et al., 2004), (Seretan, 2009)
and (Grégoire, 2010), increasingly address verbal
and other non contiguous multi-word expressions
(MWEs). These studies are complemented by re-
cent advances in parsing: robust and reliable syn-
tactic analysis now available can be coupled with
MWEs identification, and possibly also transla-
tion. The POLENG formalism discussed below
belongs to some extent to this class of tools. While
the processing of non contiguous MWEs is an im-
portant step forward, the morphological phenom-
ena in MWUs should still be addressed with preci-
sion, in particular in inflectionally rich languages.
Therefore we present below a comparative study
of Multiflex and POLENG based on an experiment
with encoding nominal and adjectival MWUs in
Polish.

3 Multiflex
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859875">
Multiflex (Savary, 2009) (Savary et al., 2009) is
a graph-based cross-language morpho-syntactic
generator of MWUs relying on a ‘two-tier ap-
proach’. First, an underlying morphological mod-
ule for simple words allows us to tokenize the
MWU lemma, to annotate its components, and to
generate inflected forms of simple words on de-
mand. Then, each inflected MWU form is seen as
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997081">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.978763818181818">
a particular combination of the inflected forms of
its components. All inflected forms of an MWU
and their variants are described within one graph.
Compounds having the same morpho-syntactic
behavior are assigned to the same graph. A uni-
fication mechanism accounts for compact repre-
sentation of agreement within constituents. For
instance, Fig. 1 presents the inflection graph for
compounds inflecting like example (3). Its first
path combines the first component $1 (here: sub-
sydia) inflected in any case with the unchanged
second component $2 (here: space) and a case-
inflected third component $3 (here: zielone).
The common unification variable $c imposes case
agreement between components $1 and $3. The
second path describes the inverted variant of this
term, in any of the cases. The description between
the paths says that each resulting compound form
agrees in case with components $1 and $3, and
inherits its gender (Gen) and number (Nb) from
component $1 as it appears in the MWU lemma
(here: neutral-2 plural).

pounds inflecting like subsydia zielone.

<bodyText confidence="0.998935045454545">
The main drawbacks of the formalism in-
clude: (i) the difficulty of conflating variants of
MWUs containing numerical expressions (ulica
XI Poprzeczna, ulica Jedenasta Poprzeczna ’11th
Cross Street’), (ii) impossibility of expressing re-
lations existing between an MWU and external el-
ements (e.g. in German die Vereinten Nationen,
Vereinte Nationen ’United Nations’). Last but not
least, Multiflex is meant for describing only con-
tiguous compounds, i.e. those that admit no inser-
tions of external elements (He made up his bloody
mind.).
For the current study we are using a MWU
encoding environment Toposław (Woli´nski et al.,
2009), which integrates Multiflex along with the
morphological analyser and generator for Polish
Morfeusz (Savary et al., 2009), and the graph edi-
tor from Unitex (Paumier, 2008). Toposław speeds
up the automated controlled encoding of MWUs
by automatic look-up of constituents, filtering of
MWUs entries, as well as automatic graph cre-
ation, debugging and filtering.

4 POLENG Formalism
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999637947368421">
By the “POLENG formalism” we mean the for-
malism used in the POLENG rule-based machine
translation system (Jassem, 1996; Jassem, 2004)
for the purposes of morphosyntactic description
of MWUs in bilingual lexicons.
The POLENG formalism was designed with
simplicity, conciseness and practical applicability
for the MWU recognition and generation in mind,
rather than care for nuances and theoretical co-
herence or elegance. As in Multiflex, a two-tier
approach was used; however all inflected forms
of a MWU are described by means of a compact,
linear string rather than a graph. (One of the ad-
vantages of using such an approach is that MWU
descriptions can be edited within a regular text in-
put control and can be easily stored in a single
database field.) For instance the term subsydia
zielone from example (3) has the following de-
scription:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.966665294117647">
(8) N:5p[subsydium_N! zielony_A]
where:
• N is a part-of-speech tag (N = noun, i.e. it is
a nominal phrase),
• additional morphosyntactic flags are given
after the colon – 5 stands for the fifth (neuter)
gender, p – stands for plural (i.e. the phrase
is used only in plural),
• the description of individual components
is given in square brackets, namely the
first component of subsydia zielone is
the lexeme identified with subsydium_N
(i.e. the noun subsydium ‘subsidy’) and
the second2 one – the lexeme identified
with zielony_A (i.e. the adjective zielony
‘green’); the main (head) component is
marked with !.

<footnote confidence="0.974507">

</footnote>
<page confidence="0.99598">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.966266090909091">
Note that case, number and gender agreement
between the MWU components is not imposed ex-
plicitly. It is rather assumed implicitly (by default,
all inflected components of a nominal MWU must
agree in case, number and gender). Such assump-
tions have to be hard-coded into MWU recogni-
tion/generation modules for particular languages
– this is the price one pays for the simplicity of
the formalism.
The order of the components of a MWU
is assumed to be fixed (except for verbal
MWUs, more on this later), e.g. zielone
subsydia is not covered by (8), i.e. a sep-
arate entry zielone subsydia described as
N:5p[zielony_A subsydium_N!] must
be entered.3
The identifier of a lexeme is usually its base
form followed by an underscore and its part-
of-speech tag (e.g. subsydium_N). In case of
homonyms of the same part of speech, consec-
utive numbers are appended. For instance, the
Polish verb upa´s´c ‘fall down’ is denoted with
upa´s´c_V and its homonym upa´s´c ‘fatten up’
is denoted with upa´s´c_V2.4 Homonym identi-
fiers are assigned roughly in order of frequency.
In POLENG, lexeme identifiers can be abbre-
viated to the POS tag (followed by a number,
if necessary) on condition that its base form is
the same as the form that is used in the base
form of the MWU. For instance, in Example (a)
in Table 15 N:3[N! A] is an abbreviation for
N:3[system_N! operacyjny_A].
A component of a MWU which is not inflected
(in that particular MWU) is referred to simply as
0, see Example (b) in Table 1.
A lexeme identifier may be followed by a hy-
phen and a so-called sublexeme tag if a subset of
inflected forms can be used in a given MWU, see
Example (c) in Table 1 (PA denotes active partici-
ple forms and GR – gerundial forms). Also addi-
3Note that the position of the adjective may affect the
meaning of a Polish MWU, e.g. twardy dysk is a disk that
happens to be hard, whereas dysk twardy is a term (hard disk,
HDD).

<footnote confidence="0.9600814">
4Both verbs have the same base form but different valence
and inflected forms.
5All the examples in Table 1 are real entries from the lexi-

tem.

<bodyText confidence="0.998407473684211">
tional flags may be specified, for instance in Ex-
ample (d) the flag u is used (it means that the up-
per case of the first letter is required).
Polish verbal MWUs are treated in a different
manner than other types of MWUs. Namely the
fixed order of components is not assumed, for
instance, in Example (e) in Table 1 each of the
six permutations of the main verb chodzi´c ‘walk’,
the adverb boso ‘barefoot’ and the prepositional
phrase po rosie ‘through the dew’ is acceptable
(the flag T denotes the imperfective aspect). The
only restriction is the fixed order of the compo-
nents of the PP. This restriction is specified using
round brackets. What’s more, a verbal phrase does
not need to be contiguous in a given sentence to be
recognized by the POLENG system. For example,
the verbal MWU chodzi´c boso po rosie, described
as in Example (e), will be detected in the follow-
ing sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.674659">
(9) Po
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.970382666666667">
Through
‘Anna walked barefoot through the dew today.’
POLENG allows for describing required (but
not fixed) constituents, using so-called slots, see
Example (f) in Table 1, where $L$ is a slot for a
noun phrase in locative (note that slots are given in
the “base form” of a MWU, not in its description,
where a slot is simply marked with 0).
It is also possible to describe some relations
between MWUs and external elements (e.g. be-
tween a German MWU and an article, cf. die
Vereinten Nationen, Vereinte Nationen ’United
Nations’) within the POLENG formalism. How-
ever, this is achieved by rather ad hoc methods.
The descriptions of MWUs does not have to
be entered manually. The POLENG machine
translation system is equipped with a special
“translation” direction in which a phrase can be
“translated” automatically into its description as
a MWU. New MWUs are usually described in
this automatic manner and are corrected manually
if necessary (e.g. while entering equivalents in
other languages). There are also tools for the au-
tomatic detection of anomalies in MWU descrip-
tions (e.g., cases when a Polish MWU was de-
scribed as a nominal phrase and its English equiv-
alent as a verbal phrase).

Both POLENG and Multiflex have proved ade-
quate for the large-scale lexicalized description of
MWUs in several languages and in different appli-
cations. Table 2 lists the lexical resources created
within both formalisms.
The Multiflex formalism has been used for the
construction of language resources of compounds
in various applications (Savary, 2009): (i) general-
purpose morphological analysis, (ii) term extrac-
tion for translation aid, (iii) named entity recogni-
tion, (iv) corpus annotation. The Multiflex imple-
mentation has been integrated into several NLP
tools for corpus analysis and resource manag-

5.2 Describing New Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975271791666667">
In order to perform a qualitative and quantitative
comparative analysis of POLENG and Multiflex
we have performed an experiment with encoding
new linguistic data. By “encoding” we mean as-
signing a Multiflex inflection graph or a POLENG
MWU description to each MWU. Four distinct
initial lists of about 500 compounds each have
been prepared: (i) two lists with compounds of
general Polish, (ii) two lists with economical and
financial terms. About 80% of the entries con-
sisted of 2 words. One or two novice lexicogra-
phers were to encode one list of (i) and one of (ii).7
The two remaining lists were to be dealt with by
an expert lexicographer. Almost all entries were
compound common nouns although some con-
tained proper name components (reguła Ramseya
‘Ramsey rule’) and some were compound adjec-
tives (biały jak ´smier´c ‘as white as death’).
Table 2 shows the time spent on each part of
the experiment. The training phase of each system
consisted in watching its demo, reading the user’s
documentation, making sample descriptions, and
discussing major functionalities with experts. The

further encoding phase was performed by each
lexicographer on his own with rare interaction
with experts.
Describing general language data proves
slightly more time consuming for novice lexi-
cographers due to exceptional behavior of some
units, such as depreciativity, gender variation,
etc. With Multiflex, the average speed of a novice
lexicographer is of 21 and 27 entries per hour for
the general and terminological language, respec-
tively. In the case of an expert, these figures are
of 36 and 67 entries per hour. Thus, the encoding
by an expert is about 1.6 and 2.5 times faster
than by a novice for terminological and general
language, respectively. The big difference in ex-
pert encoding time between both data categories
can be justified by the fact that terminological
data require domain-specific knowledge, and
contain more components per entry and more
embedded terms. Nevertheless, the general
language compounds present more grammatical
idiosyncrasies such as depreciativeness, gender
change, etc. The two novice lexicographers
reported that it took them about 6 to 7.5 hours of
personal efforts (training excluded) in order to
gain confidence and efficiency with the formalism
and the tools, as well as with the rather rich Polish
tagset. The Multiflex expert spent about 50%
of her time on creating graphs from scratch and
assigning them to MWUs. As these graphs can be
reused for further data, the future encoding time
should drop even more. Both novice and expert
lexicographers heavily used the block working
mode and filtering options.
With POLENG, the lexicographers were given
the MWU descriptions generated automatically
by the POLENG system (see Section 4). As most
of these descriptions (90%) were correct, the lex-
icographers’ work was almost reduced to revi-
sion and approval. Most errors in the descrip-
tions generated automatically involved non-trivial
homonyms and rare words, not included in the
POLENG lexicons (e.g. names of exotic curren-
cies).
Table 3 shows the quantitative analysis of
MWU inflection paradigms created by the expert
lexicographer.8 Unsurprisingly, the 5 most fre-
quent paradigms cover up to 77% of all units.
They correspond to 3 major syntactic struc-
tures (in Multiflex, possibly embedded): Noun
Adj (agencja towarzyska ’escort agency’), Noun
Noungenitive (dawca organów ’organ donor’), and
Adj Noun (biały sport ’winter sport’), with or
without number inflection (adwokat/adwokaci di-
abła ’devil’s advocate/advocates’ vs dzieła wszys-
tkie ’collected works’), and some of them allow-
ing for inversion of components (brat cioteczny,
cioteczny brat ’cousin’). Conversely, 33%
through 57% of all Multiflex paradigms (about
50% for POLENG) concern a single MWU each.
In Multiflex delimiting embedded compounds al-
lows to keep the number of paradigms reasonably
low, here 23 and 3 embedded MWU were identi-
fied for terminological and general language, re-
spectively (embedded MWUs are not allowed in
POLENG).
With Multiflex some data remain erroneously or
only partially described after the experiment. Ta-
ble 4 shows the typology and quantities of prob-
lems encountered by novice lexicographers:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962764625">
• For general language, the high percentage of
errors in inflection paradigms is due to one
repeated error: lack of the number value. As
the full list of all inflection categories rele-
vant to a class is explicitly known, this kind
of errors may be avoided if the encoding
tool automatically checks the completeness
of morphological descriptions.

tifiers were reduced to POS-tags and some redundant mor-

• Redundancies in graphs are mainly due to
identical or isomorphic graphs created sev-

detect such cases would be helpful.
• The incompletely described entries are
mainly due to unknown single components.
Despite its very high coverage, the mor-
phological analyzer and generator Morfeusz
lacks some single items9: general language
lexemes (radarowiec ‘radar-operating po-
liceman’), rare currency units (cedi), foreign
person names (inflected in Polish, e.g. Bev-
eridge’owi), and borrowed terms (forwar-
dowy ‘forward-bound’). Some rare words
are homonyms of common words but they
differ in inflection (lek ‘Albanian currency
unit’). It is thus necessary to incorporate an
encoding tool for new general language or
application-dependent single units.
• We consider the description of an entry non
optimal if the data helpful for determining
the inflection graph are not correctly indi-
cated. The effective graphs are however cor-
rect here, and so are the resulting inflected
forms.

<bodyText confidence="0.99974965">
Some further problems stem from the limits of
either Multiflex or Morfeusz design. Firstly, unlike
POLENG, Multiflex does not allow to describe
compounds having a lexically free but grammat-
ically constrained element (‘slots’, cf sec. 4).
Secondly, inflection variants of single words,
such as transformacyj ’transformationgen.pl.’ are
not distinguished in Morfeusz by grammatical
features, thus it is impossible to forbid them
in compounds via feature constraints (transfor-
macji wolnorynkowych but not *transformacyj
wolnorynkowych ’free market transformations’).
Thirdly, since depreciativity is modeled in Mor-
feusz as inflectional class rather than category it
is not easy to obtain depreciative forms of nouns
from their base forms (chłopi/chłopy na schwał
’lusty fellows’).
The following problems were encountered dur-
ing the descriptions of MWUs with the POLENG
formalism:

• As was the case with Multiflex, some sin-
gle components (mainly of economical and
financial compounds) were absent in the
POLENG Polish lexicon. Nonetheless, in-
flected forms of an unknown component can
be recognized/generated provided that they
end in frequent and regular suffixes (e.g. in
suffixes typical of adjectives such as -owy, -
cyjny) – i.e. “virtual” lexemes are created if
needed. Otherwise, an unknown component

makes the recognition/generation of a given
MWU impossible. However, the descrip-
tion can be entered anyway, and as soon as a
missing lexeme is entered into the POLENG
lexicon, the MWU will be correctly recog-
nized/generated.

• What is a multi-word unit is defined by the
POLENG tokenizer. Some of the terms de-
scribed in the experiment, such as by-pass,
quasi-pienia¸dz (quasi-money), are tokenized
as single terms by the POLENG tokenizer
and, consequently cannot be covered by the
POLENG MWU formalism.
• As it was mentioned in Section 4, it is not

possible to cover variability in word order
with one description in the POLENG formal-
ism (unlike in Multiflex), the only exception
being totally free order of verbal phrases.
The same limitation applies to MWUs with
alternative or optional components. In such
cases, multiple MWUs have to be entered
and described separately. However, in order
to avoid redundancy in bilingual lexicons, it
is possible to link variant MWUs with so-
called references (i.e. an equivalent in the
target language has to be specified for just
one of them).
• The rate of actual errors is higher than
in Multiflex. Most of them involve non-
trivial homonyms and words absent from
the POLENG lexicon. If MWUs with such
words were marked in some way for a lexi-
cographer, the error rate would probably be
much lower.

6 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999972488372093">
MWUs show a complex linguistic behavior, par-
ticularly in inflectionally rich languages, such as
Slavic ones. They call for descriptive formalisms
that allow to account for their numerous morpho-
logical, syntactic and semantic variants. We have
presented two formalisms used for the description
of MWUs in Polish, and we have performed a
comparative analysis of the two formalisms. Mul-
tiflex aims at a precise and explicit description,
as well as at adaptivity to different languages and
morphological models. It allows to conflate many
types of MWUs variants such as acronyms, inver-
sions etc. However its use is relatively slow, and
non contiguous units, or units containing semanti-
cally free elements (‘slots’), cannot be described.
See also (Savary, 2008) for a detailed contrastive
analysis of Multiflex with respect to 10 other sys-
tems for a lexical description of MWUs in dif-
ferent languages such as (Karttunen et al., 1992),
(Jacquemin, 2001), and (Alegria et al., 2004).
POLENG offers a complementary approach: it
includes a faster semi-controlled encoding pro-
cess, allows for the treatment of non contiguous
units or ‘slots’, and was applied to more massive
data in professional machine translation. Its for-
malism is however more implicit, thus less inter-
operable, and variant conflation can be done to a
limited degree only.
Encoding experiments involving both novice
and expert lexicographers showed that both tools
can be efficiently used for creating morphologi-
cal resources of MWUs. They also allowed to put
forward further improvements of our tools such
as verifying the completeness of morphological
description, checking paradigm identity, and en-
coding new single-word entries. Both tools are
used for the morphological description of MWUs
in different languages, notably Slavic ones, which
show a rich inflection system. They have been
used in various NLP applications: computational
lexicography, machine translation, term extrac-
tion, named entity identification, and text normal-
ization.

We believe that the proper treatment of MWUs in this context calls for a computational approach which must be, at least partially, lexicalized, i.e. based on electronic lexicons, in which MWUs are explicitly described. Corpus-based machine learning approaches bring interesting complementary robustness-oriented solutions. However taken alone, they can hardly cope with the following important phenomenon: while MWUs represent a high percentage of items in natural language texts, most of them, taken separately, appear very rarely in corpora. For instance, (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002) experimented with a random sample of two hundred English verb-particle constructions and showed that as many as two thirds of them appear at most three times in the Wall Street Journal corpus. The variability of MWUs is another challenge to knowledge-poor methods, since basic techniques such as lemmatisation or stemming of all corpus words, result in overgeneralizations (e.g. customs office vs. *custom office) or in overlooking of exceptions (e.g. passersby). Moreover, machine learning methods cannot reliably be used alone for less resourced languages. In such cases an efficient annotation of</context>

The POLENG formalism was designed with simplicity, conciseness and practical applicability for the MWU recognition and generation in mind, rather than care for nuances and theoretical coherence or elegance. As in Multiflex, a two-tier approach was used; however all inflected forms of a MWU are described by means of a compact, linear string rather than a graph.

Toposław speeds up the automated controlled encoding of MWUs by automatic look-up of constituents, filtering of MWUs entries, as well as automatic graph creation, debugging and filtering. 4 POLENG Formalism By the “POLENG formalism” we mean the formalism used in the POLENG rule-based machine translation system (Jassem, 1996; Jassem, 2004) for the purposes of morphosyntactic description of MWUs in bilingual lexicons. The POLENG formalism was designed with simplicity, conciseness and practical applicability for the MWU recognition and generation in mind, rather than care for nuances and theoretical coherence or elegance. As in Multiflex, a two-tier approach was used; however all inflected forms of a MWU are described by means of a compact, linear string rather than a graph. (One of the advantages of using such an approach is that MWU descriptions can be edited within a regular text input control and can be easily stored in a sin</context>

Earlier examples of such approaches include lexc (Karttunen et al., 1992), FASTR (Jacquemin, 2001), HABIL (Alegria et al., 2004), and Multiflex discussed below. They mainly concentrate on contiguous nominal and adjectival MWUs, sometimes considering limited insertions of external elements. More recent approaches, such as (Villavicencio et al., 2004), (Seretan, 2009) and (Grégoire, 2010), increasingly address verbal and other non contiguous multi-word expressions (MWEs). These studies are complemented by recent advances in parsing: robust and reliable syntactic analysis now available can be coupled with MWEs identification, and possibly also translation.

Multiflex aims at a precise and explicit description, as well as at adaptivity to different languages and morphological models. It allows to conflate many types of MWUs variants such as acronyms, inversions etc. However its use is relatively slow, and non contiguous units, or units containing semantically free elements (‘slots’), cannot be described. See also (Savary, 2008) for a detailed contrastive analysis of Multiflex with respect to 10 other systems for a lexical description of MWUs in different languages such as (Karttunen et al., 1992), (Jacquemin, 2001), and (Alegria et al., 2004). POLENG offers a complementary approach: it includes a faster semi-controlled encoding process, allows for the treatment of non contiguous units or ‘slots’, and was applied to more massive data in professional machine translation. Its formalism is however more implicit, thus less interoperable, and variant conflation can be done to a limited degree only. Encoding experiments involving both novice and expert lexicographers showed that both tools can be efficiently used for creating morphological resources of MWUs.

The variability of MWUs is another challenge to knowledge-poor methods, since basic techniques such as lemmatisation or stemming of all corpus words, result in overgeneralizations (e.g. customs office vs. *custom office) or in overlooking of exceptions (e.g. passersby). Moreover, machine learning methods cannot reliably be used alone for less resourced languages. In such cases an efficient annotation of a large corpus needed for machine learning usually requires the pre-existence of e-lexicons (Savary and Piskorski, 2010). Despite these drawbacks machine learning allows robustness and a rapid development, while 2 Proceedings of the Multiword Expressions: From Theory to Applications (MWE 2010), pages 2–10, Beijing, August 2010 knowledge-based methods in general have the reputation of being very labor intensive. In this paper we try to show how effective tools of the the latter class can be. We present two formalisms and tools designed in view of lexicalized MWU variant description: Multiflex and POLENG.

First, an underlying morphological module for simple words allows us to tokenize the MWU lemma, to annotate its components, and to generate inflected forms of simple words on demand. Then, each inflected MWU form is seen as 3 a particular combination of the inflected forms of its components. All inflected forms of an MWU and their variants are described within one graph.
