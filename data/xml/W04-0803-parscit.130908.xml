<bodyText confidence="0.999958">
The SENSEVAL-3 task to perform automatic
labeling of semantic roles was designed to
encourage research into and use of the FrameNet
dataset. The task was based on the considerable
expansion of the FrameNet data since the
baseline study of automatic labeling of semantic
roles by Gildea and Jurafsky. The FrameNet data
provide an extensive body of “gold standard”
data that can be used in lexical semantics
research, as the basis for its further exploitation
in NLP applications. Eight teams participated in
the task, with a total of 20 runs. Discussions
among participants during development of the
task and the scoring of their runs contributed to
a successful task. Participants used a wide
variety of techniques, investigating many aspects
of the FrameNet data. They achieved results
showing considerable improvements from Gildea
and Jurafsky’s baseline study. Importantly, their
efforts have contributed considerably to making
the complex FrameNet dataset more accessible.
They have amply demonstrated that FrameNet is
a substantial lexical resource that will permit
extensive further research and exploitation in
NLP applications in the future.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991804">
Word-sense disambiguation has frequently been
criticized as a task in search of a reason. Since a
considerable portion of a sense inventory has only a
single sense, the question has been raised whether the
amount of effort required by disambiguation is
worthwhile. Heretofore, the focus of disambiguation
has been on the sense inventory and has not examined
the major reason why we would have lexical
knowledge bases: how the meanings would be
represented and thus, available for use in natural
language processing applications. At the present
time, a major paradigm for representing meaning has
emerged in frame semantics, specifically in the
FrameNet project.
A worthy objective for the Senseval community
is the development of a wide range of methods for
automating frame semantics, specifically identifying
and labeling semantic roles in sentences. An
important baseline study of this process has recently
appeared in the literature (Gildea and Jurafsky,
2002). The FrameNet project (Johnson et al., 2003)
has put together a body of hand-labeled data and the
Gildea and Jurafsky study has put together a set of
suitable metrics for evaluating the performance of an
automatic system.

1 The Senseval-3 Task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99782426923077">
This Senseval-3 task calls for the development of
systems to meet the same objectives as the Gildea and
Jurafsky study. The data for this task is a sample of
the FrameNet hand-annotated data. Evaluation of
systems is measured using precision and recall of
frame elements and overlap of a system’s frame
element sentence positions with those identified in the
FrameNet data.
The basic task for Senseval-3 is: Given a
sentence, a target word and its frame, identify the
frame elements within that sentence and tag them
with the appropriate frame element name.
The FrameNet project has just released a major
revision (FrameNet 1.1) to its database, with 487
frames using 696 distinctly-named frame elements
(although it is not guaranteed that frame elements
with the same name have the same meaning). This
release includes 132,968 annotated sentences (mostly
taken from the British National Corpus). The
Senseval-3 task used 8,002 of these sentences
selected randomly from 40 frames (also selected
randomly) having at least 370 annotations (out of the
100 frames having the most annotations).1
Participants were provided with a training set
that identified, for each of the 40 frames, the lexical
unit identification number (which equates to a file
name) and a sentence identification name. They were
also provided with the answers, i.e., the frame
element names and their beginning and ending
positions. Since the training set was much larger than
the test set, participants were required to use the
FrameNet 1.1 dataset to obtain the full sentence, its
target word, and the tagged frame elements.
For the test data, participants were provided, for
each frame, with sentence instances that identified the
lexical unit, the lexical unit identification number, the
sentence identification number, the full sentence, and
a specification of the target along with its start and
end positions.
Participants were required to submit their
answers in a text file, with one answer per line. Each
line was to identify the frame name and the sentence
identifier and then all the frame elements with their
start and end positions that their systems were able to
identify. For example, for the sentence
However, its task is made much more
difficult by the fact that derogations
granted to the Welsh water authority allow
&lt;Agent&gt;it&lt;/&gt; to &lt;Target&gt;pump&lt;/&gt;
&lt;Fluid&gt;raw sewage&lt;/&gt; &lt;Goal&gt;into both
those rivers&lt;/&gt;.
the correct answer would appear as follows:

The sentences provided to participants were not
presegmented (as defined in the Gildea and Jurafsky
1The test set was generated with the Windows-based
program FrameNet Explorer, available at
http://www.clres.com/SensSemRoles.html. FrameNet
Explorer provides several facilities for examining the
FrameNet data: by frame, frame element, and lexical
units. For each unit, a user can explore a frame’s
elements, associated lexical units, frame-to-frame
relations, frame and frame element definitions, lexical
units and their definitions, and all sentences.
study); this was left to the participants&apos; systems. The
FrameNet dataset contains considerable information
that was tagged by the FrameNet lexicographers.
Participants could use (and were strongly encouraged
to use) any and all of the FrameNet data in
developing and training their systems. In the test,
participants could use any of this data, but were
strongly encouraged to use only data available in the
sentence itself and in the frame that is identified.
(This corresponds to the “more difficult task”
identified by Gildea and Jurafsky.) Participants could
submit two runs, one with (non-restrictive case) and
one without (restrictive case) using the additional
data; these were scored separately.
FrameNet recognizes the permissibility of
“conceptually salient” frame elements that have not
been instantiated in a sentence; these are called null
instantiations (see Johnson et al. for a fuller
description). An example occurs in the following
sentence (sentID=&amp;quot;1087911&amp;quot;) from the Motion
frame: “I went and stood in the sitting room doorway,
but I couldn&apos;t get any further -- my legs wouldn&apos;t
move.” In this case, the FrameNet taggers considered
the Path frame element to be an indefinite null
instantiation (INI). Frame elements that have been so
designated for a particular sentence appear to be
Core frame elements, but not all core frame elements
missing from a sentence have designated as null
instantiations. The correct answer for this case, based
on the tagging, is as follows:
Motion.1087911 Theme (82,88) Path (0,0)
Participants were instructed to identify null
instantiations in submissions by giving a (0,0) value
for the frame element’s position.2 Participants were
told in the task description that null instantiations
would be analyzed separately.3
For this Senseval task, participants were allowed
to download the training data at any time; the 21-day
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.425426875">
2This turned out to be an incorrect method, since some
frame elements (notably “I” at the beginning of a
sentence) would have a position of (0,0), i.e, the
beginning and ending positions are both 0. Such
instances in the test set were identified and handled
separately to distinguish them from null instantiations.
3No analysis of null instantiations has yet been
performed.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996345">
restriction on submission of results after downloading
the training data was waived since this is a new
Senseval task and the dataset is very complex.
Participants could work with the training data as long
as they wished. The 7-day restriction of submitting
results after downloading the test data still applied.
In general, FrameNet frames contain many frame
elements (perhaps an average of 10), most of which
are not instantiated in a given sentence. Systems were
not penalized if they returned more frame elements
than those identified by the FrameNet taggers. For
the 8002 sentences in the test set, only 16212 frame
elements constituted the answer set.
In scoring the runs, each frame element (not a
null instantiation) returned by a system was counted
as an item attempted. If the frame element was one
that had been identified by the FrameNet taggers, the
answer was scored as correct. In addition, however,
the scoring program required that the frame
boundaries identified by the system’s answer had to
overlap with the boundaries identified by FrameNet.
An additional measure of system performance was
the degree of overlap. If a system’s answer coincided
exactly to FrameNet’s start and end position, the
system received an overlap score of 1.0. If not, the
overlap score was the number of characters
overlapping divided by the length of the FrameNet
start and end positions (i.e., end-start+1)4
The number attempted was the number of non-
null frame elements generated by a system. Precision
was computed as the number of correct answers
divided by the number attempted. Recall was
computed as the number of correct answers divided
by the number of frame elements in the test set.
Overlap was the average overlap of all correct
answers. The percent Attempted was the number of
frame elements generated divided by the number of
frame elements in the test set, multiplied by 100. If a
system returned frame elements not identified in the
test set, its precision would be lower.

Four of these five teams submitted a restricted run
and an unrestricted run (frame boundaries were
identified, i.e., the task was a classification task of
identifying the applicable frame element).
The results for the classification task are shown
in Table 1. The average precision over all these runs
is 0.803 and the average recall is 0.757. The overlap
in each run is almost identical to the precision, and
differs slightly because there may have been some
slight positional errors in either the FrameNet data or
the sentence string provided in the test data.

In both cases, the percent attempted is quite high,
except for one system in the restricted runs. This
indicates that systems were able to identify potential
frame elements in quite a large percentage of the
cases. Systems were allowed to return any number of
frame elements for a sentence and it is possible for a
system to identify more frame elements than were
identified by the FrameNet taggers. For example, run
08a asserted many more frame elements than were
identified in the answer key. As a result, its percent
attempted was much higher than 100 percent. The
number of frame elements in other runs not identified
in the answer key is unknown. The effect of a higher
number attempted lowers the precision for a run and
increases the percent attempted.

<bodyText confidence="0.9784766">
Overall, the results achieved in this SENSEVAL-3
task were quite high. Several teams achieved results
much better than those obtained by Gildea and
Jurafsky. The average precision of 0.80 for all runs
in the unrestricted case is only slightly lower than the
82% accuracy achieved in that study when using
presegmented constituents. Many teams achieved
precision at or above 0.90, indicating that their
routines for classifying constituents is quite good. In
view of the fact that the number of frames and frame
elements in FrameNet has expanded considerably
since the Gildea and Jurafsky study, it appears that
the methods employed have become quite accurate in
classifying constituents.5
Results for the restricted were also quite good in
comparison with the Gildea and Jurafsky study,
which achieved 65% precision and 61% recall at the
“more difficult task of simultaneously segmenting
constituents and identifying their semantic role.” In
this task, four teams achieved results between 80 and
90 percent for precision and between 65 and 78
percent for recall.
The participants in this task used a wide variety
of methods and data in their systems. In addition,
they used the FrameNet dataset from a wide diversity
of perspectives. In some cases, they developed
mechanisms for grouping the FrameNet data by part
of speech or making use of the nascent inheritance
hierarchy in FrameNet. In some cases, they used all
frames as a basis for training and in others, they

not yet been investigated, so the assertion that this task

employed novel grouping methods based on the
similarities among different frames.
The successes of many teams seems to indicate
that the FrameNet dataset is an excellent lexical
resource and that the resources devoted to its
development have been quite valuable. The collective
efforts of the participants have contributed greatly to
making this complex database more accessible and
more amenable to even further development, not only
for research purposes, but also for use in many NLP
applications.
