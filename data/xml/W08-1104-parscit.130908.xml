Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999974928571429">
Summarising georeferenced (can be iden-
tified according to it’s location) data in
natural language is challenging because it
requires linking events describing its non-
geographic attributes to their underlying
geography. This mapping is not straightfor-
ward as often the only explicit geographic
information such data contains is latitude
and longitude. In this paper we present an
approach to generating textual summaries
of georeferenced data based on spatial ref-
erence frames. This approach has been im-
plemented in a data-to-text system we have
deployed in the weather forecasting domain.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917111111111">
Data-to-text systems are NLG systems that gener-
ate texts from raw input data. Many examples of
such systems have been reported in the literature,
which have been applied in a number of domains and
to different types of input. For example, BabyTalk
(Portet et al., 2007) generates medical reports from
sensors monitoring a baby in a Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit, while (Hallett and Scott, 2005) describe a
system for generating reports from events in medical
records. SumTime (Reiter et al., 2005), (Coch, 1998)
and Fog (Goldberg et al., 1994) generate weather
forecasts from the output of weather computer sim-
ulation models, while (Iordanskaja et al., 1992) and
(R¨osner, 1987) both generate summaries from em-
ployment statistics.
As the above examples show most work in data-to-
text up to now has concentrated almost exclusively
on time series data. Work on generating text from
spatial data has been reported in Coral (Dale et al.,
2005), which generates route descriptions of a path
constructed from Geographical Information Systems
(GIS) datasets. Unlike the input to Coral however,
most georeferenced data contains only limited spatial
information(in many cases, only latitude and longi-
tude).
As (Roy and Reiter, 2005) point out, connecting
language to the non-linguistic world is an important
issue in Cognitive Science and Aritificial Intelligence;
moreover, geographic data is becoming increasingly
ubiquitous as the availability of low cost locational
devices such as GPS increases, and GIS become more
user friendly. Therefore, we believe exploring the
issue of generating textual reports grounded in real
world geographical data is an important challenge.
On a more practical level, it is also a natural next
step in the application of data-to-text technology to
apply it to geographically referenced data.
In the RoadSafe project described in the following
section, we have been investigating this issue in a
data-to-text system that generates road ice weather
forecasts. The subsequent focus of this paper is the
adaption of NLG techniques to the task of summaris-
ing georeferenced data. In particular, the incorpora-
tion of spatial reference frames to generate grounded
(from external GIS data sources) spatial references.

2 Background

<bodyText confidence="0.999788625">
Weather forecasting has been one of the most suc-
cessful and widely researched application domains for
NLG systems. The main novel aspect that sets Road-
Safe apart from other weather forecast generators
and indeed, other data-to-text systems, is it’s appli-
cation to spatio-temporal data. The input to Road-
Safe is generated by a road ice simulation model,
which outputs a large (in order of Megabytes) mul-
tivariate data set, shown in Figure 1.
The output of the model contains predicted mea-
surements of 9 meteorological parameters for 1000’s
of points across a road network, each measured at
20 minute intervals during a 24 hour forecast pe-
riod. A map of such a network, belonging to a lo-
cal council in the UK, is shown in Figure 2. This
model forms the basis of a road ice forecasting ser-

trivial due to the complexity and size of the in-
put data.
2. Our system is required to achieve a huge
data/text compression ratio (Human authored
texts are short and concise summaries). There-
fore, content selection is a serious issue for our
system.
3. Describing the effect of the underlying geogra-
phy on weather conditions, such as ‘possible gale
force gusts on higher ground’, is an integral part
of the communicative goal of the text. Infor-
mation containing such relationships is not ex-
plicit in the input data and therefore must be
grounded.

vice provided by Aerospace and Marine International
(AMI), which is delivered to local councils via an
online Road Weather Information System (RWIS).
This service provides road engineers with up to the
minute weather information using graphs, graphics
and textual reports that allows them to base their
road maintenance operations on during the winter
months. In RoadSafe we have been working on gen-
erating the textual reports, such as the one shown in
Figure 3, automatically from the model data.
The communicative goal of the textual reports is
to complement detailed tabular and graphical pre-
sentations of the model data with a more general
overview of the weather conditions. In the context
of our work this presents a number of challenges:
1. The input data has to be analysed, this is non-
‘Another night with all routes quickly falling be-
low zero this evening. Only isolated urban spots in
the south will only drop to around zero. Freezing
fog patches will become more widespread during the
night but thin a little tomorrow morning especially
in the south.’

As noted in the previous section, the input data to
our system contains only limited spatial information:
a point identifier that ties the measurement site to
a particular route and a latitude longitude coordi-
nate. Therefore it is necessary for our system to per-
form additional spatial reasoning to characterise the
input in terms of its underlying geography. The ar-

in (Reiter, 2007) to include this additional process-
ing. In Section 3.1 we explain some of the rationale
behind these design decisions based on observations
from our knowledge acquisition(KA) Studies. In Sec-

3.1 Observations from Knowledge
Acquisition Studies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999926">
We have been working closely with experts at AMI
for a number of winters now in the development of
RoadSafe. During this time we have found that two
interrelated aspects in particular have influenced the
architecture of our system, which we describe next.

Spatial Reference Frames Frames of reference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9823788">
in this context are a particular perspective in which
the domain can be observed. More precisely, they are
sets of related geographical features (such as elevated
areas) which partition the domain into meaningful
sub areas for descriptive purposes. In Levinson’s ter-
minology (Levinson, 2003), they are absolute refer-
ence systems as they employ fixed bearings. In the
RoadSafe domain we have identified 4 main spatial
frames of reference used by experts in our corpus de-
scribed in (Turner et al., 2008):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99976595">
1. Altitude e.g. ‘rain turning to snow on higher
ground’.
2. Absolute Direction e.g. ‘some heavier bursts in
the north’.
3. Coastal Proximity e.g. ‘strong winds along the
coast’.
4. Population e.g. e.g. ‘Roads through the Urban
areas holding just above freezing’.
Communicative Purpose of Spatial Descrip-
tions From our studies we have found that experts
generally follow 4 steps when writing road ice fore-
casts:
1. Build frames of reference to geographical fea-
tures that may affect general weather condi-
tions.
2. Build an overview of the general weather pat-
tern.
3. Select important features to communicate from
the pattern.
4. Communicate the summary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999198181818182">
Building frames of reference to geographical fea-
tures is important for a human forecaster to be able
to take into account how the geography of the region
influences the general weather conditions. Under-
standing the weathers interaction with the terrain
enables them to make reliable meteorological infer-
ences. For example a spatial description such as ‘rain
turning to snow in rural areas’ may be geographically
accurate, but does not make sense meteorologically
as it is purely by chance that this event is occurring
at that location.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995201">

<bodyText confidence="0.9999416">
From a NLG system perspective it is important to
take into account the communicative purpose of spa-
tial descriptions in this context, which are express-
ing causality (the effect of geographical features on
weather conditions) rather than being purely loca-
tive. For example, changes in precipitation type are
more commonly seen in higher elevation areas where
the air temperature is generally lower, so a spatial de-
scription describing such an event should make use of
a reference frame that reflects this interaction. Simi-
larly, road surface temperatures are generally higher
in urban areas where there is a general population
effect. For a referring expression generation (REG)
strategy this means that this requires not only ade-
quate spatial representation and reasoning capabili-
ties about an objects location, but also additional in-
formation about an objects function in space. This is
a problem which has been acknowledged in the psy-
cholinguistic literature e.g. (Coventry and Garrod,
2004).

3.2 Geographic Characterisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968761904762">
Geographic Characterisation is responsible for
grounding the location of the data by making the
relationship between it’s underlying geography ex-
plicit. As the first stage of data analysis it assigns
additional spatial properties to each data point by in-
tersecting the point with external GIS data sources
representing the frames of reference we have iden-
tified. For example after characterisation, the first
point in the spatial attribute table shown in Figure
1 is assigned values [0m,SSW,Urban,Coastal] to rep-
resent elevation, absolute compass direction, popula-
tion density of its immediate area and its proximity
to the coast respectively. This process is more com-
monly known as a form of data enrichment in the
Spatial Data Mining community (Miller and Han,
2001). In the scope of our work it is important for
two reasons: most importantly, it provides a set of
properties that are used by the REG module to gen-
erate spatial descriptions; secondly, these properties
can be taken into account by our analysis method
during the initial segmentation of the data.

3.3 Spatial Reasoner and Spatial Database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991166666666">
The spatial database provides a repository of geo-
graphic information. Frames of reference are stored
as thematic layers from various GIS data sources con-
sisting of sets of boundary objects. For example, al-
titude is represented as sets of polygons representing
altitude contours at a given resolution and popula-
tion is a set of town boundary polygons. The spatial
reasoning module provides a high level interface be-
tween the spatial database and the rest of the system.
It is responsible for performing geographic character-
isation and providing spatial query functionality to
the rest of the system.

4 Text Generation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894285714286">
In Section 2 we outlined 3 main challenges that our
system must address. Our approach to the first,
analysis of the input data, is described in (Turner
et al., 2007). In the following Sections 4.1 and 4.2,
we describe the approach taken by our text generator
to the former two: content selection and generating
spatial references.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99611">
4.1 Content Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999272">
The input to the document planning module of our
system is a series of meteorological events (such as
rises in temperature) describing each parameter over
specific periods of time and locations. The basic
events are generated by data analysis which are then
abstracted into higher level concepts by data inter-
pretation. As it is impossible to include all these
events in such a short summary our system also gen-
erates a table as well as text shown in Figure 5.
In our KA studies we have found experts use
a qualitative overview of weather conditions when
writing forecasts to perform this task, confirming
similar observations reported in (Sripada et al.,
2001). We take the same approach as experts in
our system by including the internal information
of the table (generated by the data analysis mod-
ule) as input to document planning. This serves as
the overview for content selection and allows con-
struction of an initial document plan consisting of
overview event leaf nodes. An example of this struc-
ture for the system output shown in Figure 5 is given
in Figure 6. Each overview event corresponds to a
column (or columns in the case of snow and rain) in
the table if the column indicates a significant thresh-
old for the parameter it describes (i.e. yes for ice).

<bodyText confidence="0.99998752631579">
The next stage is to construct messages from the
leaf nodes of the document plan. This is done in a
top down fashion by further annotating the tree with
events from the input list. Additional events are se-
lected by using the information from the overview
events to retrieve them from the list. This has the
benefit of keeping the content of both text and ta-
ble consistent. The final tree comprises the input
to the microplanner where messages are realised as
sentences in the final text and typically contain two
events per message (as observed in our corpus). For
example the overview event describing Precip in Fig-
ure 6 is realised as two sentences in Figure 5: Win-
try precipitation will affect most routes throughout
the forecast period at first [overview event], falling
as snow flurries in some places above 300M at first
[event]. Snow spreading throughout the forecast pe-
riod to all areas [event] and persisting in some places
above 300M until end of period [event].

4.2 Generating Spatial References to
Geographic Areas
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99907635">
Approaches to REG to date have concentrated
on distinguishing descriptions (e.g. (Gatt and
van Deemter, 2007),(van Deemter, 2006),(Horacek,
2006),(Krahmer et al., 2003),(Dale and Reiter,
1995); more specifically that is given a domain, they
look to generate a description of a target object that
uniquely distinguishes it from all other objects within
that domain. In a large geographic environment
such as a road network consisting of 1000’s of points,
where the task is to refer to an event occurring at a
small subset of those points, it is impractical (gen-
erated descriptions may be long and complex) and
prohibitively expensive (large numbers of spatial re-
lations between objects may have to be computed) to
take this approach. A more practical approach is to
generate spatial descriptions in terms of regions that
are not strictly distinguishing (i.e. urban areas, high
ground) rather than in terms of the points contained
within that region. Indeed, this is the strategy em-
ployed by human authors in our corpus. Therefore,
in a description such as ‘road surface temperatures
will fall below zero in some places in the south west’,
distractors can be defined as the set of points within
the south western boundary that do not satisfy this
premise.
The relaxation of the requirement to generate a
distinguishing description simplifies the REG task in
this context as a single referring expression may be
deemed acceptable to refer to a wide range of situa-
tions. For example, ‘in some places in the south west’
could be used to refer to a large number of possible
subsets of points that fall within the south western
boundary of the network. A simple REG strategy
is to find the set of properties to use in a descrip-
tion that introduce the least number of distractors.
However, as mentioned previously in Section 3.1, an
added constraint is that a spatial description should
use an appropriate frame of reference in the context
of the event it is describing. For example, describing
a change in precipitation type using population as
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.97359">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99975437037037">
a frame of reference (i.e ‘rain turning snow in some
rural places’) is not a sound meteorological inference
because population density does not affect precipi-
tation. This could cause a reader to infer false im-
plicatures (Grice, 1975), and consequently lead to
unnecessary treatment of part of the road network
so should be avoided. To account for this, following
(Dale and Reiter, 1995) we include a preference set
of reference frames for each type of event that must
be described. Absence from the set signifies that the
specified frame of reference should not be used in
that context.
Recall from Section 3.2 that properties in this case
relate directly to sets of boundary objects within a
frame of reference. Our content selection module
takes as input a series of individual proportions de-
scribing the spatial distribution of each parameter
within each frame of reference at a particular time
point. A score is calculated for each set of properties
by averaging over the sum of proportions for each
frame of reference. An appropriate frame of refer-
ence is then selected by choosing the one with the
highest score from the preference set for the given
event. An examples of the input for the generated
description ‘falling as snow flurries in some places
above 300M at first’ in Figure 5 is shown in Figure
7.

5 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9934222">
The system presented in this paper is in its first
incarnation, RoadSafe is still actively under devel-
opment in preparation for a full scale user evalua-
tion. We have been evaluating the quality of the
output of the current system using post edit tech-
niques and feedback from expert meteorologists at
AMI. Our prototype has been installed at AMI since
the start of the year and is being used to generate
draft road ice forecasts for one of their local council
clients. One forecast is generated per day which is
then post-edited by an on duty forecaster before it is
sent to the client. While common in Machine Trans-
lation post-edit evaluations are still relatively rare in
NLG. The only large scale post-edit evaluation of an
NLG system to our knowledge has been reported in
(Sripada et al., 2005).
Our current evaluation is small in comparison to
that evaluation; SumTime-Mousam, the system be-
ing evaluated in that work was generating 150 draft
forecasts per day. However, it does try to address
some of the problems the authors encountered during
that evaluation. The main issue outlined by (Sripada
1N.B. this example is taken from route network that is
land locked and therefore coastal proximity is not taken into
account in this case.

et al., 2005) was that their analysis was post-hoc and
therefore not supported by authors or by an editing
tool, which made it difficult to analyse why post-edits
were made. We have accounted for this by including
post-editing as part of our development process and
making use of a simple online interface that allows
the editor to select check boxes as they edit and in-
sert any general comments they may have. Check
boxes record edit reasons at a high level, for exam-
ple content, sentence order, spatial description used
etc. This is because it is not reasonable to expect a
time-constrained forecaster to spend time recording
every edit he makes.
Another important lesson pointed out by (Sripada
et al., 2005) is the need for a pilot study to analyse
the post-edit behaviour of individual authors to ac-
count for noisy data. This is certainly worthwhile,
but is difficult to carry out in our domain where fore-
casters work in variable shift patterns and on vari-
able forecasting tasks at different times. Instead, we

have used feedback forms as a way to gain qualitative
data on both the general quality of the texts and the
post-editing process. We present our results in Sec-
tion 5.1. In Section 5.2 we provide some discussion
of the results and describe future work.

5.1 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987446808511">
Our post-edit corpus currently consists of 112 texts,
2 texts(1 generated,1 edited) for 56 forecast days.
Of the 56 generated texts 54 have been edited before
being released to the user. As a general evaluation
criterion, our generated texts are generally too long
with a mean word length of 72 (standard deviation
of 21) compared to a mean word length of 53 (stan-
dard deviation of 17). The mean word count differ-
ence per forecast is 21 (standard deviation of 15). In
general analysis of the corpus is difficult, as in some
cases (18) texts have been basically rewritten. This
is not reflecting the quality of the text as such, but
the fact that the author has access to other informa-
tion sources such as satellite maps, which can lead
him to draw different inferences to those in the raw
model data available to the system. Furthermore,
(Hopwood, 2004) acknowledge as ice prediction mod-
els have become increasingly advanced, the primary
added value provided by weather forecasters is to
function as quality control and error mitigation for
the model, using their insight and experience to make
amendments particularly on marginal nights (where
the road surface temperature may or may not fall be-
low zero). Such cases can only be considered as noise
for analysis purposes, and the fact that our system
cannot account for this without the additional infor-
mation has been acknowledged by all forecasters in
their editing comments and feedback forms.
Focusing on 74 real post-edits (not attributed to
model data) recorded in our corpus, they can be clas-
sified into the following broad error categories: con-
tent edits - 65% and microplanning edits 35%. One
major problem we have identified with the current
generated text is the way in which overview events
described in 4.1 are realised. Deletions of whole sen-
tences describing overview events such as the one
highlighted in bold in Figure 8 constitute over half
(52%) of content edits, which may help to explain
the large descrepency in word counts. Essentially
forecasters believe they can often communicate sim-
ilar information as subsequent statements about the
same parameter making the texts repetitive at times.
Therefore they suggest they should either be omit-
ted or be realised as more interpretative statements,
such as ‘A marginal night for most routes’ for the
omitted statement in Figure 8. Forecasters also of-
ten delete subsequent statements following overview

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990958333334">
The general feedback to our system has been encour-
aging. In terms of the exploitability of the system in
its current form it has received mixed reviews from
4 forecasters: 1 forecaster rated the system as good
for content and very poor on fluency; 1 rated it as
ok for both; 1 forecaster rated it as poor for content
and ok for fluency; 1 forecaster rated it as poor for
both. Generally all forecasters believe the generated
texts should tell a more fluent story about weather
conditions with more causal linking between events.
In terms of the techniques and approach outlined in
this paper they have worked well, although as ac-
knowledged in the previous section more sophisti-
cated domain reasoning and aggregation techniques
are required if the text is to function as a concise
summary, and indeed reach the standard of human
authored texts.
Making the required improvements highlighted in
the previous section is the focus of current work. Af-
ter these improvements have been made we plan to
carry out an evaluation with users of the forecasts.
We hope to also extend the functionality of the sys-
tem by generating individual route forecasts, which
can be accessed interactively through the table.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996730769231">
We have presented an approach to generating ge-
ographically grounded summaries of georeferenced
data using spatial reference frames. This approach
has been implemented in a data-to-text system for
generating road ice forecasts. An important task in
summarising georeferenced data is to describe the
data in terms of its underlying geography it refer-
ences. This presents an interesting challenge for con-
ventional REG approaches as finding a distinguish-
ing description for large numbers of objects in geo-
graphic space is not practical. We have found char-
acterising the geography in terms of spatial reference
frames provides a good solution as it provides a flex-
ible representation to describe set of objects in terms
of geographic areas.
We have also implemented a simple top down
content selection approach based on the idea of
overview, taken from how we have observed ex-
perts commonly performing the summarisation task.
While this approach works well for content selection,
a post-edit evaluation with experts has highlighted
that realising the overview in the text can make texts
verbose and have the effect of making subsequent
statements describing related events in the discourse
sound repetitive. This is important as experts re-
quire a short concise summary of weather conditions.

<abstract confidence="0.996740866666667">Summarising georeferenced (can be identified according to it’s location) data in natural language is challenging because it requires linking events describing its nongeographic attributes to their underlying geography. This mapping is not straightforward as often the only explicit geographic information such data contains is latitude and longitude. In this paper we present an approach to generating textual summaries of georeferenced data based on spatial reference frames.

Many examples of such systems have been reported in the literature, which have been applied in a number of domains and to different types of input. For example, BabyTalk (Portet et al., 2007) generates medical reports from sensors monitoring a baby in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, while (Hallett and Scott, 2005) describe a system for generating reports from events in medical records. SumTime (Reiter et al., 2005), (Coch, 1998) and Fog (Goldberg et al., 1994) generate weather forecasts from the output of weather computer simulation models, while (Iordanskaja et al., 1992) and (R¨osner, 1987) both generate summaries from employment statistics. As the above examples show most work in data-totext up to now has concentrated almost exclusively on time series data.

Similarly, road surface temperatures are generally higher in urban areas where there is a general population effect. For a referring expression generation (REG) strategy this means that this requires not only adequate spatial representation and reasoning capabilities about an objects location, but also additional information about an objects function in space. This is a problem which has been acknowledged in the psycholinguistic literature e.g. (Coventry and Garrod, 2004). 3.2 Geographic Characterisation Geographic Characterisation is responsible for grounding the location of the data by making the relationship between it’s underlying geography explicit. As the first stage of data analysis it assigns additional spatial properties to each data point by intersecting the point with external GIS data sources representing the frames of reference we have identified. For example after characterisation, the first point in the spatial attribute table shown in Figure 1 is assigned values [0m,SSW,Urban,Coastal] to represent elevation, absolute compass direction, populati</context>

In a large geographic environment such as a road network consisting of 1000’s of points, where the task is to refer to an event occurring at a small subset of those points, it is impractical (generated descriptions may be long and complex) and prohibitively expensive (large numbers of spatial relations between objects may have to be computed) to take this approach.

For example, describing a change in precipitation type using population as 20 a frame of reference (i.e ‘rain turning snow in some rural places’) is not a sound meteorological inference because population density does not affect precipitation. This could cause a reader to infer false implicatures (Grice, 1975), and consequently lead to unnecessary treatment of part of the road network so should be avoided. To account for this, following (Dale and Reiter, 1995) we include a preference set of reference frames for each type of event that must be described. Absence from the set signifies that the specified frame of reference should not be used in that context. Recall from Section 3.2 that properties in this case relate directly to sets of boundary objects within a frame of reference. Our content selection module takes as input a series of individual proportions describing the spatial distribution of each parameter within each frame of reference at a particular time point.

Furthermore, (Hopwood, 2004) acknowledge as ice prediction models have become increasingly advanced, the primary added value provided by weather forecasters is to function as quality control and error mitigation for the model, using their insight and experience to make amendments particularly on marginal nights (where the road surface temperature may or may not fall below zero). Such cases can only be considered as noise for analysis purposes, and the fact that our system cannot account for this without the additional information has been acknowledged by all forecasters in their editing comments and feedback forms.

During this time we have found that two interrelated aspects in particular have influenced the architecture of our system, which we describe next. Spatial Reference Frames Frames of reference in this context are a particular perspective in which the domain can be observed. More precisely, they are sets of related geographical features (such as elevated areas) which partition the domain into meaningful sub areas for descriptive purposes. In Levinson’s terminology (Levinson, 2003), they are absolute reference systems as they employ fixed bearings. In the RoadSafe domain we have identified 4 main spatial frames of reference used by experts in our corpus described in (Turner et al., 2008): 1. Altitude e.g. ‘rain turning to snow on higher ground’. 2. Absolute Direction e.g. ‘some heavier bursts in the north’. 3. Coastal Proximity e.g. ‘strong winds along the coast’. 4.

As the first stage of data analysis it assigns additional spatial properties to each data point by intersecting the point with external GIS data sources representing the frames of reference we have identified. For example after characterisation, the first point in the spatial attribute table shown in Figure 1 is assigned values [0m,SSW,Urban,Coastal] to represent elevation, absolute compass direction, population density of its immediate area and its proximity to the coast respectively. This process is more commonly known as a form of data enrichment in the Spatial Data Mining community (Miller and Han, 2001). In the scope of our work it is important for two reasons: most importantly, it provides a set of properties that are used by the REG module to generate spatial descriptions; secondly, these properties can be taken into account by our analysis method during the initial segmentation of the data. 3.3 Spatial Reasoner and Spatial Database The spatial database provides a repository of geographic information. Frames of reference are stored as thematic layers from various GIS data sources consisting of sets of boundary objects.

In this paper we present an approach to generating textual summaries of georeferenced data based on spatial reference frames. This approach has been implemented in a data-to-text system we have deployed in the weather forecasting domain. 1 Introduction Data-to-text systems are NLG systems that generate texts from raw input data. Many examples of such systems have been reported in the literature, which have been applied in a number of domains and to different types of input. For example, BabyTalk (Portet et al., 2007) generates medical reports from sensors monitoring a baby in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, while (Hallett and Scott, 2005) describe a system for generating reports from events in medical records.

As (Roy and Reiter, 2005) point out, connecting language to the non-linguistic world is an important issue in Cognitive Science and Aritificial Intelligence; moreover, geographic data is becoming increasingly ubiquitous as the availability of low cost locational devices such as GPS increases, and GIS become more user friendly. Therefore, we believe exploring the issue of generating textual reports grounded in real world geographical data is an important challenge. On a more practical level, it is also a natural next step in the application of data-to-text technology to apply it to geographically referenced data. In th</context>

The basic events are generated by data analysis which are then abstracted into higher level concepts by data interpretation. As it is impossible to include all these events in such a short summary our system also generates a table as well as text shown in Figure 5. In our KA studies we have found experts use a qualitative overview of weather conditions when writing forecasts to perform this task, confirming similar observations reported in (Sripada et al., 2001). We take the same approach as experts in our system by including the internal information of the table (generated by the data analysis module) as input to document planning. This serves as the overview for content selection and allows construction of an initial document plan consisting of overview event leaf nodes. An example of this structure for the system output shown in Figure 5 is given in Figure 6. Each overview event corresponds to a column (or columns in the case of snow and rain) in the table if the column indicates a significant threshold for the parameter it describes (i.e. yes for</context>

Our prototype has been installed at AMI since the start of the year and is being used to generate draft road ice forecasts for one of their local council clients. One forecast is generated per day which is then post-edited by an on duty forecaster before it is sent to the client. While common in Machine Translation post-edit evaluations are still relatively rare in NLG. The only large scale post-edit evaluation of an NLG system to our knowledge has been reported in (Sripada et al., 2005). Our current evaluation is small in comparison to that evaluation; SumTime-Mousam, the system being evaluated in that work was generating 150 draft forecasts per day. However, it does try to address some of the problems the authors encountered during that evaluation. The main issue outlined by (Sripada 1N.B. this example is taken from route network that is land locked and therefore coastal proximity is not taken into account in this case.

We have accounted for this by including post-editing as part of our development process and making use of a simple online interface that allows the editor to select check boxes as they edit and insert any general comments they may have. Check boxes record edit reasons at a high level, for example content, sentence order, spatial description used etc. This is because it is not reasonable to expect a time-constrained forecaster to spend time recording every edit he makes. Another important lesson pointed out by (Sripada et al., 2005) is the need for a pilot study to analyse the post-edit behaviour of individual authors to account for noisy data. This is certainly worthwhile, but is difficult to carry out in our domain where forecasters work in variable shift patterns and on variable forecasting tasks at different times. Instead, we 21 have used feedback forms as a way to gain qualitative data on both the general quality of the texts and the post-editing process. We present our results in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2 we provide some discussion of the results and describe future work. 5.1 Results Our post-edit corpus current</context>
