Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.998611142857143">
Unstructured clinical notes are rich sources
for valuable patient information. Information
extraction techniques can be employed to
extract this valuable information, which in
turn can be used to discover new knowledge.
Named entity recognition and normalization
are the basic tasks involved in information
extraction. In this paper, identification of
disorder named entities and the mapping of
identified disorder entities to SNOMED-CT
terminology using UMLS Metathesaurus is
presented. A supervised linear chain
conditional random field model based on sets
of features to predict disorder mentions is
used in conjunction with MetaMap to
identify and normalize disorders. Error
analysis conclude that recall of the developed
system can be significantly increased by
adding more features during model
development and also by using a frame based
approach for handling disjoint entities.

EHR data typically contains demographics,
medications, administrative and billing data. The
contents of EHR can be either in structured, semi-
structured or unstructured. Clinical notes
contribute to majority of the unstructured data in
EHR.
Clinical notes in EHR are often plain text
records and valuable resources to obtain patient
information (Denny, 2012). Clinical notes are rich
in content and may include information on a
patient’s demographics, medical history, family
history, medications prescribed and lab test
results. Information extraction tools can be used
to extract the aforementioned unstructured data to
discover new knowledge (Jensen, Jensen, &amp;
Brunak, 2012).
Named entity recognition (NER) is an
important subtask of information extraction to
identify the boundaries of named entities. Clinical
notes often include a wide variety of entities like
diseases, disorders, anatomical sites, symptoms
and procedures. However, often these entities are
expressed in various forms and formats.
Normalization is another sub-task of information
extraction where the entities identified during
NER are accurately mapped to concepts of
standard terminologies or ontologies. Rich tools

Medical Language System (UMLS)
Metathesaurus and National Center for
Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal are two
resources that are very useful for normalization in
the biomedicine domain. The UMLS
Metathesaurus provides access to medical
standard terminologies such as SNOMED-CT,
ICD9, and RxNorm (Bodenreider, 2004). In this
paper, the authors presented an information
extraction system to i) identify the disorders in
clinical notes using conditional random fields
(CRFs) (Lafferty, McCallum, &amp; Pereira, 2001),
and ii) normalize the identified disorders to
SNOMED-CT terminology concepts (Spackman,
Campbell, &amp; CÃ, 1997) using MetaMap (Aronson
&amp; Lang, 2010).

<bodyText confidence="0.776629923076923">
The authors used SemEval 2015 ShARe corpus to
develop a CRF based information extraction
system (Suominen et al., 2013). The ShARe
corpus included training, development and test
sets which were prepared using clinical notes
from the MIMICII database (Saeed, Lieu, Raber,
&amp; Mark, 2002). The clinical notes were manually
annotated by the annotators for disorder mentions
and were normalized to SNOMED-CT concepts
using UMLS concept unique identifiers (CUIs).
Details on the corpus development are available
in the annotation guideline1. Table 1 summarizes
the details of training, development and test sets.
In this paper, disorder refers to SNOMED-CT
concepts that belong to the eleven UMLS
semantic types: Congenital Abnormality;
Acquired Abnormality; Injury or Poisoning;
Pathologic Function; Disease or Syndrome;
Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction; Cell or
Molecular Dysfunction; Experimental Model of
Disease; Anatomical Abnormality; Neoplastic
Process; and Signs and Symptoms. In other
words, an entity which is not part of these eleven
UMLS semantic types or is not possible to map to
a SNOMED-CT is not a disorder. These kinds of
disorders are annotated as CUI-less in the corpus.

2.3 Disorder Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823222222222">
The authors used discharge summaries from both
training and development sets to develop the CRF
model. Mallet implementation of CRF was used
for disorder recognition using BIO tagging
method (McCallum, 2002). The authors
developed the CRF-model using BIO tagging
method where each word token is assigned one of
three tags &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;I&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;O&amp;quot;. The “B” tag corresponds to
beginning of a disorder entity, “I” tag corresponds
to Inside disorder entity and “O” tag corresponds
to outside (not a disorder entity). For example, let
us consider this sentence - &amp;quot;The patient had
headache with neck stiffness and was unable to
walk for minutes.&amp;quot; The classifier will produce the
following token annotation “The/O patient/O
had/O headache/B with/O neck/B stiffness/I
and/O was/O unable/B to/I walk/I for/O
minutes/O. /O”. The disorder identification CRF
classifier uses word, syntactic features like POS
tags and shallow parser tags. Authors also used
previous word, its POS tags and next word and its
POS tags as feature. Also, the authors developed
a custom dictionary by extracting all disorder
mentions in the training set, tokenized them and
labelled each tokens as B-dict and I-dict. The
developed custom dictionary was also used as
features to build the classifier.

2.4 Disorder Normalization

<bodyText confidence="0.999963153846154">
Each disorder recognized by the CRF model was
passed through MetaMap to find normalized
concepts. For normalization of disorder concepts
to UMLS SNOMED-CT CUIs, MetaMap 2013
version with UMLS 2013AB as data source was
used. MetaMap server (also known as mmserver)
is configured to process the output from the CRF
model using Java API. MetaMap was configured
to normalize entities that can be mapped to
SNOMED-CT terminology only. No additional
rules or logic is used to handle one entity mapped
to multiple UMLS CUIs from different UMLS
semantic types. Entity with the highest MetaMap

2.5 Evaluation Metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976956521739">
The system developed (disorder identification and
normalization) was evaluated using the test set.
The official evaluation script provided by the
SemEval 2015 Task 14 organizers was used to
evaluate performance of the developed system
using precision (P), recall (R) and F score (F).
Evaluation was carried using strict (St) and
relaxed (Re) F-scores. In strict setting, the official
evaluation script identified the predicted disorder
mention as a true positive if the spans (start and
end offsets) are exactly the same as in the gold
standard and the predicted CUI is correct. The
predicted disorder is evaluated as false positive if
spans are incorrect or the identified CUI is
incorrect. In relaxed setting, the official
evaluation script identified the predicted disorder
mention as a true positive if there is any overlap
between the predicted (start and end offsets) and
gold standard spans. The predicted disorder is
evaluated as false positive if spans are incorrect or
identified CUI is incorrect. It is important to note
that the evaluation metrics for both NER and
normalization are calculated together.

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998573857142857">
The authors developed the current system based
on their previous work (Jonnagaddala, Kumar,
Dai, Rachmani, &amp; Hsu, 2014). A custom built
dictionary to handle disjoint disorders is
integrated into the current system. With this
addition, the system was able to find most of the
disjoint mentions in the development set. The
official evaluation results of the performance of
the developed system on NER and normalization
was not reported independently. A thorough error
analysis was performed on the output generated
by the developed system. Unfortunately, it is
found that the authors misinterpreted the UMLS
semantic types covered in the training,
development and test sets. The authors used the
default disease disorder semantic group which
consists of twelve semantic types including
“Findings” type. However, in the ShARe corpus
“Findings” semantic type was ignored. The
concepts related to this type should have been
normalized as CUI-less. This significantly made
an impact on the overall system performance.
Implementing additional rules to filter out CUIs
belonging to “Findings” semantic type and
labelling them as CUI-less have significantly
improved the system performance. During CRF
model development, the authors experimented
with various n-grams on the training set and found
that trigrams performed best, so trigram of word
and trigram of word POS tags as a feature. The
identification of disorder might have been
improved further with post processing if custom
dictionaries to handle abbreviations, acronyms
and misspelled entities were employed
(Jonnagaddala, Liaw, Ray, Kumar, &amp; Dai, 2014).

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999874785714286">
In conclusion, the authors presented an
information extraction system based on CRF and
MetaMap to identify disorder mentions in clinical
notes and normalize the identified entities to
SNOMED CT terminology using UMLS CUIs.
The performance of the developed system was not
as expected mainly due to the fact that system
included “findings” semantic type in the
normalized entities, when they were supposed to
be normalized as CUI-less. In future, the authors
would like to improve the performance of the
system by employing semi-supervised techniques
and custom dictionaries for abbreviations,
acronyms and misspellings.

In this paper, the authors presented an information extraction system to i) identify the disorders in clinical notes using conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty, McCallum, &amp; Pereira, 2001), and ii) normalize the identified disorders to SNOMED-CT terminology concepts (Spackman, Campbell, &amp; CÃ, 1997) using MetaMap (Aronson &amp; Lang, 2010). 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Dataset The authors used SemEval 2015 ShARe corpus to develop a CRF based information extraction system (Suominen et al., 2013).

A custom built dictionary to handle disjoint disorders is integrated into the current system. With this addition, the system was able to find most of the disjoint mentions in the development set. The official evaluation results of the performance of the developed system on NER and normalization was not reported independently. A thorough error analysis was performed on the output generated by the developed system. Unfortunately, it is found that the authors misinterpreted the UMLS semantic types covered in the training, development and test sets. The authors used the default disease disorder</context>

Implementing additional rules to filter out CUIs belonging to “Findings” semantic type and labelling them as CUI-less have significantly improved the system performance. During CRF model development, the authors experimented with various n-grams on the training set and found that trigrams performed best, so trigram of word and trigram of word POS tags as a feature. The identification of disorder might have been improved further with post processing if custom dictionaries to handle abbreviations, acronyms and misspelled entities were employed (Jonnagaddala, Liaw, Ray, Kumar, &amp; Dai, 2014). 5 Conclusion In conclusion, the authors presented an information extraction system based on CRF and MetaMap to identify disorder mentions in clinical notes and normalize the identified entities to SNOMED CT terminology using UMLS CUIs. The performance of the developed system was not as expected mainly due to the fact that system included “findings” semantic type in the normalized entities, when they were supposed to be normalized as CUI-less. In future, the authors would like to improve the performance of the system by employing semi-supervised techniques and custom dictionaries for abbrevi</context>

For pre-processing, the authors used apache OpenNLP2 library which is a machine learning based toolkit. The output from preprocessing was used to extract several features which were used to train a Conditional Random Field based model. An overview of the developed system is schematized in figure 1. 2.3 Disorder Identification The authors used discharge summaries from both training and development sets to develop the CRF model. Mallet implementation of CRF was used for disorder recognition using BIO tagging method (McCallum, 2002). The authors developed the CRF-model using BIO tagging method where each word token is assigned one of three tags &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;I&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;O&amp;quot;. The “B” tag corresponds to beginning of a disorder entity, “I” tag corresponds to Inside disorder entity and “O” tag corresponds to outside (not a disorder entity). For example, let us consider this sentence - &amp;quot;The patient had headache with neck stiffness and was unable to walk for minutes.&amp;quot; The classifier will produce the following token annotation “The/O patient/O had/O headache/B with/O neck/B stiffness/I and/O was/O unable/B to/I walk/I for/O minutes/O. /O”.
