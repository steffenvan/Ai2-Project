We propose a unified model of syntax and dis-
course in which text structure is viewed as a
tree structure augmented with anaphoric rela-
tions and other secondary relations. We de-
scribe how the model accounts for discourse
connectives and the syntax-discourse-seman-
tics interface. Our model is dependency-based,
ie, words are the basic building blocks in our
analyses. The analyses have been applied
cross-linguistically in the Copenhagen Depen-
dency Treebanks, a set of parallel treebanks
for Danish, English, German, Italian, and Spa-
nish which are currently being annotated with
respect to discourse, anaphora, syntax, mor-
phology, and translational equivalence.

<bodyText confidence="0.999866608695652">
The Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks, CDT,
consist of five parallel open-source treebanks for
Danish, English, German, Italian, and Spanish.1
The treebanks are annotated manually with re-
spect to syntax, discourse, anaphora, morpho-
logy, as well as translational equivalence (word
alignment) between the Danish source text and
the target texts in the four other languages.
The treebanks build on the syntactic annota-
tion in the 100,000-word Danish Dependency
Treebank (Kromann 2003) and Danish-English
Parallel Dependency Treebank (Buch-Kromann
et al. 2007). Compared to these treebanks, which
are only annotated for syntax and word align-
ment, the new treebanks are also annotated for
discourse, anaphora, and morphology, and the
syntax annotation has been revised with a much
more fine-grained set of adverbial relations and a
number of other adjustments. The underlying
Danish PAROLE text corpus (Keson and
Norling-Christensen 1998) consists of a broad
mixture of 200-250 word excerpts from general-
purpose texts.2 The texts were translated into the

other languages by professional translators who
had the target language as their native language.
The final treebanks are planned to consist of
approximately 480 fully annotated parallel texts
for Danish and English, and a subset of approx-
imately 300 fully annotated parallel texts for
German, Italian, and Spanish, with a total of ap-
proximately 380,000 (2·100,000 + 3·60,000) an-
notated word or punctuation tokens in the five
treebanks in total. So far, the annotators have
made complete draft annotations for 67% of the
texts for syntax, 40% for word alignments, 11%
for discourse and anaphora, and 3% for morpho-
logy. The annotation will be completed in 2010.
In this paper, we focus on how the CDT tree-
banks are annotated with respect to syntax and
discourse, and largely ignore the annotation of
anaphora, morphology, and word alignments. In
sections 2 and 3, we present the syntax and dis-
course annotation in the CDT. In section 4, we
present our account of discourse connectives. In
section 5, we briefly discuss the syntax-discour-
se-semantics interface, and some criticisms
against tree-based theories of discourse.
2 The syntax annotation of the CDT
The syntactic annotation of the CDT treebanks is
based on the linguistic principles outlined in the
dependency theory Discontinuous Grammar
(Buch-Kromann 2006) and the syntactic annota-
tion principles described in Kromann (2003),
Buch-Kromann et al. (2007), and Buch-Kromann
et al (2009). All linguistic relations are represen-
ted as directed labelled relations between words
or morphemes. The model operates with a prima-
ry dependency tree structure in which each word
or morpheme is assumed to act as a complement
or adjunct to another word or morpheme, called
the governor (or head), except for the top node

cerpts that have a coherent discourse structure, which in-
cludes 80% of the excerpts in our text corpus. Moreover,
given the upper limit on the corpus size that we can afford
to annotate, small text excerpts allow our corpus to have a
diversity in text type and genre that may well offset the the-
oretical disadvantage of working with reduced texts.

of the sentence or unit, typically the finite verb.
This structure is augmented with secondary rela-
tions, e.g., between non-finite verb forms and
their subjects, and in antecedent-anaphor rela-
tions. Primary relations are drawn above the
nodes and secondary below, all with directed ar-
rows pointing from governor to dependent. The
relation label is written at the arrow tip, or in the
middle of the arrow if a word has more than one
incoming arrow.

<bodyText confidence="0.96292470212766">
An example is given in Figure 1 above. Here, the
arrow from “had2” to “It1” identifies “It” as the
subject of “had”, and the arrow from “forced3” to
“to5” identifies the phrase headed by “to” as the
prepositional object of “forced”. Every word de-
fines a unique phrase consisting of the words that
can be reached from the head word by following
the downward arrows in the primary tree.3 For
example, in Figure 1, “worked11” heads the
phrase “worked11 for12”, which has a secondary
noun object nobj in “all8”; “had10” heads the
phrase “she9 had10 worked11 for12”; and “It1”
heads the phrase “It1”. Examples of secondary
dependencies include the coreferential relation
between “her4” and “she9”, and the anaphoric re-
lation in Figure 2. Part-of-speech functions are
written in capital letters under each word. The in-
ventory of relations is described in detail in our
annotation manual (posted on the CDT web site).
Dependency arrows are allowed to cross, so
discontinuous word orders such as topicalisations
and extrapositions do not require special treat-
ment. This is exemplified by the discontinuous
dependency tree in Figure 2, in which the relat-
ive clause headed by “was7” has been extraposed
from the direct object and placed after the time
adverbial “today5”.4
3Because of this isomorphism between phrases and head
words, a dependency tree can always be represented as a
phrase-structure tree in which every phrase has a unique
lexical head; the resulting phrase-structure tree is allowed to
contain crossing branches.
4In our current syntax annotation, we analyze the initial con-
nective or conjunction as the head of the subordinate clause;
Figure 2. Primary dependency tree and second-
ary relations for the sentence “We discussed a
book today which was written by Chomsky”.
Buch-Kromann (2006) provides a detailed theory
of how the dependency structure can be used to
construct a word-order structure which provides
fine-grained control over the linear order of the
sentence, and how the dependency structure
provides an interface to compositional semantics
by determining a unique functor-argument struc-
ture given a particular modifier scope (ie, a spe-
cification of the order in which the adjuncts are
applied in the meaning construction).5

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9863286875">
Just like sentence structures can be seen as de-
pendency structures that link up the words and
morphemes within a sentence (or, more preci-
sely, the phrases headed by these words), so dis-
course structures can be viewed as dependency
structures that link up the words and morphemes
within an entire discourse. In Figures 1 and 2, the
top nodes of the analysed sentences (the only
words without incoming arrows) are the finite
verbs “had2” and “discussed2” respectively, and
these are shown in boldface. Basically, the CDT
discourse annotation consists in linking up each
such sentence top node with its nucleus (under-
stood as the unique word within another sentence
that is deemed to govern the relation) and la-
belling the relations between the two nodes.
The inventory of discourse relations in CDT is
described in the CDT manual. It borrows heavily
from other discourse frameworks, in particular
Rhetorical Structure Theory, RST (Mann and
Thompson, 1987; Tabaoda and Mann, 2006;
Carlson et al, 2001) and the Penn Discourse
Treebank, PDTB (Webber 2004; Dinesh et al.,
2005, Prasad et al., 2007, 2008), as well as
(Korzen, 2006, 2007), although the inventory
had to be extended to accommodate the great
in relative clauses, the relative verb functions as the head,
i.e., the arrow goes from “a (book)” to “was (written)”.
5In terms of their formal semantics, complements function
as arguments to their governor, whereas adjuncts function as
modifiers; i.e., semantically, the governor (type X) acts as
an argument with the modifier (type X/X) as its functor.

variety of text types in the CDT corpus other
than news stories. The inventory allows relation
names to be formed as disjunctions or conjunc-
tions of simple relation names, to specify mul-
tiple relations or ambiguous alternatives.
One of the most important differences be-
tween the CDT framework and other discourse
frameworks lies in the way texts are segmented.
In particular, CDT uses words as the basic build-
ing blocks in the discourse structure, while most
other discourse frameworks use clauses as their
atomic discourse units, including RST, PDTB,
GraphBank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005), and the
Pottsdam Commentary Corpus, PCC (Stede
2009).6 This allows the nucleus and satellite in a
discourse relation to be identified precisely by
means of their head words, as in the example (1)
below from the CDT corpus, where the second
paragraph is analyzed as an elaboration of the de-
verbal noun phrase “their judgment” (words that
are included in our condensed CDT analysis in
Figure 4 are indicated with boldface and sub-
scripted with numbers that identify them):
6As noted by Carlson and Marcu (2001), the boundary be-
tween syntax and discourse is rather unclear: the same
meaning can be expressed in a continuum of ways that ran-
ge from clear discourse constructions (“He laughed. That
annoyed me.”) to clear syntactic constructions (“His laugh
annoyed me.”). Moreover, long discourse units may func-
tion as objects of attribution verbs in direct or indirect
speech, or as parenthetical remarks embedded within an oth-
erwise normal sentence. CDT&apos;s use of words as basic build-
ing blocks, along with a primary tree structure that spans
syntax and discourse, largely eliminates these problems.

The full CDT analysis of (1) is given in Figure 3,
a more readable condensed version in Figure 4.
The last sentence of the first paragraph, “The
prosecuting authority has3 also reserved the pos-
sibility of appeal”, is a conjunct to the first sen-
tence, and its top node “has3” is linked to the top
node of the first sentence, “appealed1”. The slash
after a relation name indicates an explicit or im-
plicit discourse connective used by the annotat-
ors to support their choice of relation type.
As in CDT&apos;s syntax annotation, the primary
syntax and discourse relations must form a tree
that spans all the words in the text, possibly sup-
plemented by secondary relations that encode
anaphoric relations and other secondary depen-
dencies. Apart from this, CDT does not place any
restrictions on the relations; in particular, a word

4 Discourse connectives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999690555555556">
Discourse connectives play a prominent role in
PDTB, and inspire the analysis of connectives in
CDT. However, there are important differences
in analysis, which affect the way discourse struc-
tures are construed. In a construction of the form
“X C Y” where X and Y are clauses and C is a
discourse connective (such as “because”, “sin-
ce”, “when”), three dependency analyses suggest
themselves, as summarized in Table 5.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.953576333333333">

</table>
<tableCaption confidence="0.969986">
Table 5. Three analyses of discourse connectives.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998529651162791">
When analyzed as the head of the construction,
C takes X and Y as its (discourse) complements;
semantically, the meaning C&apos; of C acts as func-
tor, and the meanings X&apos;,Y&apos; of X,Y act as argu-
ments of C&apos;. When analyzed as a subordinating
conjunction, C subcategorizes for Y and modifies
X; semantically, C&apos; computes a meaning C&apos;(Y&apos;)
from Y&apos;, which acts as functor with X&apos; as argu-
ment. Finally, analyzed as a marker, C modifies
Y which in turn modifies X; semantically, Y&apos; se-
lects its meaning Y&apos;(C&apos;) based on the marker C&apos;
(i.e., the marker merely helps disambiguate Y&apos;);
Y&apos;(C&apos;) then acts as functor with argument X&apos;.
The three analyses are markedly different in
terms of their headedness, but quite similar in
terms of their semantics. CDT opts for the mark-
er analysis, with the obvious benefit that there is
no need to postulate the presence of a phonetic-
ally empty head for implicit connectives. This
analysis also implies that since discourse markers
always modify the satellite, explicit and implicit
discourse markers can be used to determine the
discourse relation and its direction.
It is interesting that almost all theories of dis-
course structure, including RST, PDTB, Graph-
Bank, PCC, and the dependency-based discourse
analysis proposed by Mladová (2008), seem to
analyze connectives as heads – even in the case
where C+Y is an adverbial clause modifying X,
where virtually all mainstream theories of syntax
opt for one of the two other analyses. Perhaps
current theories of discourse structure perceive
discourse structure as a semantic rather than syn-
tactic structure. In any case, it is not clear that
this is the most fruitful analysis. A clear distinc-
tion between syntactic structure and semantic
structure has proved crucial to the understanding
of headedness in syntax (e.g. Croft 1995, Man-
ning 1995), and it is one of the hardwon insights
of syntax that semantic centrality or prominence
is not directly reflected in the syntactic surface
structure. Something similar might be true for
discourse structure as well.

5 Syntax-discourse-semantics interface
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997633125">
CDT models discourse structure as a primary de-
pendency tree supplemented by secondary rela-
tions. We believe that a tree-based view of dis-
course provides many important benefits, most
importantly a clear interface to syntax and com-
positional semantics. There has been several at-
tempts to refute the tree hypothesis on empirical
grounds, though, including Wolf and Gibson
(2005), Prasad et al (2005), Lee et al (2008), and
Stede (2009), who have put forward important
criticisms. Our framework addresses many of
these objections, including the many problems
related to attribution verbs, which do require a
complicated treatment in our framework with
secondary dependencies. A full discussion of this
topic is, however, beyond the scope of this paper.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948916666667">
In this paper, we have presented a dependency-
based view of discourse and syntax annotation
where the syntax and discourse relations in a text
form a primary dependency tree structure linking
all the words in the text, supplemented by ana-
phoric relations and other secondary dependen-
cies. The framework forms the basis for the an-
notation of syntax, discourse, and anaphora in
the Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks. In fu-
ture papers, we will address some of the criti-
cisms that have been raised against tree-based
theories of discourse.

The treebanks build on the syntactic annotation in the 100,000-word Danish Dependency Treebank (Kromann 2003) and Danish-English Parallel Dependency Treebank (Buch-Kromann et al. 2007). Compared to these treebanks, which are only annotated for syntax and word alignment, the new treebanks are also annotated for discourse, anaphora, and morphology, and the syntax annotation has been revised with a much more fine-grained set of adverbial relations and a number of other adjustments.

That annoyed me.”) to clear syntactic constructions (“His laugh annoyed me.”). Moreover, long discourse units may function as objects of attribution verbs in direct or indirect speech, or as parenthetical remarks embedded within an otherwise normal sentence. CDT&apos;s use of words as basic building blocks, along with a primary tree structure that spans syntax and discourse, largely eliminates these problems. (1) Two conv</context>

Basically, the CDT discourse annotation consists in linking up each such sentence top node with its nucleus (understood as the unique word within another sentence that is deemed to govern the relation) and labelling the relations between the two nodes. The inventory of discourse relations in CDT is described in the CDT manual. It borrows heavily from other discourse frameworks, in particular Rhetorical Structure Theory, RST (Mann and Thompson, 1987; Tabaoda and Mann, 2006; Carlson et al, 2001) and the Penn Discourse Treebank, PDTB (Webber 2004; Dinesh et al., 2005, Prasad et al., 2007, 2008), as well as (Korzen, 2006, 2007), although the inventory had to be extended to accommodate the great in relative clauses, the relative verb functions as the head, i.e., the arrow goes from “a (book)” to “was (written)”. 5In terms of their formal semantics, complements function as arguments to their governor, whereas adjuncts function as modifiers; i.e., semantically, the governor (type X) acts as an argument with the modifier (type X/X) as its functor. 128 Figure 3.

The inventory allows relation names to be formed as disjunctions or conjunctions of simple relation names, to specify multiple relations or ambiguous alternatives. One of the most important differences between the CDT framework and other discourse frameworks lies in the way texts are segmented. In particular, CDT uses words as the basic building blocks in the discourse structure, while most other discourse frameworks use clauses as their atomic discourse units, including RST, PDTB, GraphBank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005), and the Pottsdam Commentary Corpus, PCC (Stede 2009).6 This allows the nucleus and satellite in a discourse relation to be identified precisely by means of their head words, as in the example (1) below from the CDT corpus, where the second paragraph is analyzed as an elaboration of the deverbal noun phrase “their judgment” (words that are included in our condensed CDT analysis in Figure 4 are indicated with boldface and subscripted with numbers that identify them): 6As noted by Carlson and Marcu (2001), the boundary between syntax and discourse is rather unclear: the same meaning can be expr</context>

Something similar might be true for discourse structure as well. 5 Syntax-discourse-semantics interface CDT models discourse structure as a primary dependency tree supplemented by secondary relations. We believe that a tree-based view of discourse provides many important benefits, most importantly a clear interface to syntax and compositional semantics. There has been several attempts to refute the tree hypothesis on empirical grounds, though, including Wolf and Gibson (2005), Prasad et al (2005), Lee et al (2008), and Stede (2009), who have put forward important criticisms. Our framework addresses many of these objections, including the many problems related to attribution verbs, which do require a complicated treatment in our framework with secondary dependencies. A full discussion of this topic is, however, beyond the scope of this paper. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a dependencybased view of discourse and syntax annotation where the syntax and discourse relations in a text form a primary dependency tree structure linking all the words in the t</context>
