<bodyText confidence="0.999692857142857">
We are modeling roles of individual messages
and participants in Q&amp;A discussion forums. In
this paper, we present a mixed network model
that represents message exchanges and message
influences within a discussion thread. We first
model individual message roles and thread-level
user roles using discussion content features. We
then combine the resulting message roles and the
user roles to generate the overall influence net-
work. Message influences and their aggregation
over the network are analyzed using B-centrality
measures. We use the results in identifying the
most influential message in answering the initial
question of the thread.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999953666666667">
Online discussion boards play an important role in
various fields, including science, politics, and edu-
cation. Understanding patterns of group interac-
tions can be important in many applications. For
example, in Q&amp;A forums, some messages contain
more useful or influential answers than others.
Identifying useful content can help future discus-
sions with similar issues. That is, useful informa-
tion on a topic can be sent to related discussions
(Kim et al., 2009).
There has been some work on analyzing dia-
logue patterns in online discussion boards (Feng et
al, 2006). Some of these model message roles us-
ing dialogue acts such as question act or answer
act. Most of these focus on modeling individual
messages, often using surface forms. There has
been limited study on thread-level modeling of the
true roles of the messages, whether they provide
information (source) or seek information (sink), or
which message in the thread is most useful or in-
fluential as the source.
In this paper, we present a novel model of mes-
sage influence within a discussion thread. In mod-
eling the thread-level influence of the messages,
besides the sink/source role of the individual mes-
sages, we take into account the roles of the mes-
sage posters within the thread. In Q&amp;A discussion
threads, since the roles of the posters as an infor-
mation provider or an information seeker often do
not change within the same thread, such informa-
tion can help us identify the true roles or influence
of the messages.
We combine the message roles and the user
roles with a network model. Message influences
and their aggregation over the network are ana-
lyzed using B-centrality measures. We use the
resulting influence scores in identifying the most
influential message in answering the initial ques-
tion of the thread.

We use discussion data from an Operating Systems
course in the Computer Science department at the
University of Southern California. Students use a
discussion board, most commonly, to seek help on
the project assignments. For this study, we use data
from the Fall 2007 semester, with 177 discussion
threads (randomly choose 133 for training and 44
for test) with 580 messages (randomly choose 451
for training and 129 for test).

2.1 Sink and source roles of a message
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909">
For each pair of messages where one is a reply to
the other, we model the roles of the latter, as a sink
or a source with respect to the former message or
the message author. Some messages, especially
long ones, can have both roles. Figure 1 shows an
influence model of sink and source. A node repre-
sents either a user or a message. An edge is either a
reply-to relation between two messages or an own-
ership of a message by a user. The direction of
each edge indicates the direction of influence. A
source is a message that provides information and
it generates influence. In the top graph, B responds

to A’s message as an information source. A sink
message requests information from others so the
edge direction goes towards it. Note that sinks and
sources are different from questions and answers
since some of sources can take a form of a question
(e.g. have you checked the manual?).

2.2 Information seeker and information pro-

Figure 2 shows an influence model of an informa-
tion seeker and an information provider when they
exchange messages. The information flows from
the information provider to the information seeker,
as indicated by the direction of the edges. In gen-
eral, the initial poster seeks information and his or
her role does not usually change within the thread.
Without loss of generality, we assume that within a

a certain amount of time, although he or she can
post both Sink and Source messages, as shown in
Figure 2. Using this model, we can capture the
intention of the message based on who posted the
message.

2.3 Message and Participant Role Classifiers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985631578948">
Individual messages were annotated with sink and
source information. The same message can have
both sink and source roles with respect to the prior
message or its poster.
The features used include cue phases (n-
grams) and their positions, message position in the
thread, author change information, the relative po-
sition of the message in the thread, a user’s partici-
pation frequency (normalized), n-gram of previous
messages with their positions and the message
length. The details of these features are described
in Kim et al (2009).
We used a Support Vector Machine (Chang
and Lin 2001) to create two binary classifiers
(since one message can have both roles) that iden-
tify message roles: source and sink, and one binary
classifier for user roles: information seeker and
information provider. The precisions/recalls range
from 0.89 to 0.96. F-scores are within 0.92-0.93.

3 Profiling Influence of Message with Cen-

<bodyText confidence="0.99987975">
We generate a message-role graph and a user-role
graph using the above model, and generate influ-
ence network combining user and message roles.
Message influences and their aggregation over the
network are analyzed using B-centrality measures.
To evaluate our source score accuracy (Ghosh and
Lerman 2009), we annotated the most influential
source message for the initial question (sink) in
each thread. We use Mean Reciprocal Rank Score
(MRR) to evaluate our results. The combined
model provides better results with an MRR score
of 0.90.
