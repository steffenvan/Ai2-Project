An automatic compound retrieval method is pro-
posed to extract compounds within a text mes-
sage. It uses n-gram mutual information, relative
frequency count and parts of speech as the features
for compound extraction. The problem is mod-
eled as a two-class classification problem based
on the distributional characteristics of n-gram to-
kens in the compound and the non-compound clus-
ters. The recall and precision using the proposed
approach are 96.2% and 48.2% for bigram com-
pounds and 96.6% and 39.6% for trigram com-
pounds for a testing corpus of 49,314 words. A
significant cutdown in processing time has been
observed.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999805">
In technical manuals, technical compounds
[Levi 1978] are very common. Therefore, the qual-
ity of their translations greatly affects the per-
formance of a machine translation system. If a
compound is not in the dictionary, it would be
translated incorrectly in many cases; the reason
is: many compounds are not compositional, which
means that the translation of a compound is not
the composite of the respective translations of the
individual words [Chen and Su 1988]. For exam-
ple, the translation of &apos;green house&apos; into Chinese
is not the composite of the Chinese fianslations of
&apos;green&apos; and &apos;house&apos;. Under such circumstances,
the number of parsing ambiguities will also in-
crease due to the large number of possible parts
of speech combinations for the individual words.
It will then reduce the accuracy rate in disam-
biguation and also increase translation time.
In practical operations, a computer-translated
manual is usually concurrently processed by sev-
eral posteditors; thus, to maintain the consistency
of translated terminologies among different poste-
ditors is very important, because terminological
consistency is a major advantage of machine trans-
lation over human translation. If all the termi-
nologies can be entered into the dictionary before
translation, the consistency can be automatically
maintained, the translation quality can be greatly
improved, and lots of postediting time and consis-
tency maintenance cost can be saved.
Since compounds are rather productive and
new compounds are created from day to day, it
is impossible to exhaustively store all compounds
in a dictionary. Also, it is too costly and time-
consuming to inspect the manual by people for
the compound candidates and update the dictio-
nary beforehand. Therefore, it is important that
the compounds be found and entered into the dic-
tionary before translation without much human
effort; an automatic and quantitative tool for ex-
tracting compounds from the text is thus seriously
required.
Several compound extracting approaches have
been proposed in the literature [Bourigault 1992,
Calzolari and Bindi 1990]. Traditional rule-based
systems are to encode some sets of rules to ex-
tract likely compounds from the text. However, a
lot of compounds obtained with such approaches
may not be desirable since they are not assigned
objective preferences. Thus, it is not clear how
likely one candidate is considered a compound.
In LEXTER, for example, a text corpus is ana-
lyzed and parsed to produce a list of likely ter-
minological units to be validated by an expert
[Bourigault 1992]. While it allows the test to be
done very quickly due to the use of simple anal-
ysis and parsing rules, instead of complete syn-
tactic analysis, it does not suggest quantitatively
to what extent a unit is considered a terminology
and how often such a unit is used in real text. It
might therefore extract many inappropriate termi-
nologies with high false alarm. In another statis-
tical approach by [Calzolari and Bindi 1990], the
association ratio of a word pair and the disper-
sion of the second word are used to decide if it
is a fixed phrase (a compound). The drawback is
that it does not take the number of occurrences
of the word pair into account; therefore, it is not
</bodyText>

known if the word pair is commonly or rarely used.
Since there is no performance evaluation reported
in both frameworks, it is not clear how well they
work.
A previous framework by [Wu and Su 1993]
shows that the mutual information measure and
the relative frequency information are discrimi-
native for extracting highly associated and fre-
quently encountered n-gram as compound. How-
ever, many non-compound n-grams, like &apos;is a&apos;,
which have high mutual information and high rel-
ative frequency of occurrence are also recognized
as compounds. Such n-grams can be rejected if
syntactic constraints are applied. In this paper,
we thus incorporate parts of speech of the words
as a third feature for compound extraction. An
automatic compound retrieval method combining
the joint features of n-gram mutual information,
relative frequency count and parts of speech is pro-
posed. A likelihood ratio test method, designed
for a two-class classification task, is used to check
whether an n-gram is a compound. Those n-grams
that pass the test are then listed in the order of
significance for the lexicographers to build these
entries into the dictionary. It is found that, by
incorporating parts of speech information, both
the recall and precision for compound extraction
is improved. The simulation result shows that the
proposed approach works well. A significant cut-
down of the postediting time has been observed
when using this tool in an MT system, and the
translation quality is greatly improved.
A Two Cluster Classification Model
for Compound Extraction
The first step to extract compounds is to find
the candidate list for compounds. According to
our experience in machine translation, most com-
pounds are of length 2 or 3. Hence, only bigrams
and trigrams compounds are of interest to us. The
corpus is first processed by a morphological ana-
lyzer to normalize every word into its stem form,
instead of surface form, to reduce the number of
possible alternatives. Then, the corpus is scanned
from left to right with the window sizes 2 and 3.
The lists of bigrams and trigrams thus acquired
then form the lists of compound candidates of in-
terest. Since the part of speech pattern for the n-
grams (n=2 or 3) is used as a compound extraction
feature, the text is tagged by a discrimination ori-
ented probabilistic lexical tagger [Lin et al. 1992].
The n-gram candidates are associated with a
number of features so that they can be judged as
being compound or non-compound. In particular,
we use the mutual information among the words
in an n-gram, the relative frequency count of the
n-gram, and the part of speech patterns associated
with the word n-grams for the extraction task.
Such features form an &apos;observation vector&apos; (to be
described later) in the feature space for an input
n-gram. Given the input features, we can model
the compound extraction problem as a two-class
classification problem, in which an n-gram is ei-
ther classified as a compound or a non-compound,
using a likelihood ratio A for decision making:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.950734">
A =
P(i1M,) x P(M c)
P(ilMnc) x P(M)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.984226411764706">
where Mc stands for the event that &apos;the n-gram
is produced by a compound model&apos;,
st ands
for the alternative event that &apos;the n-gram is pro-
duced by a non-compound model&apos;, and is the
Mnc
observation associated with the n-gram consisting
of the joint features of mutual information, rela-
tive frequency and part of speech patterns. The
test is a kind of likelihood ratio test commonly
used in statistics [Papoulis 1990]. If A &gt; 1, it is
more likely that the n-gram belongs to the com-
pound cluster. Otherwise, it is assigned to the
non-compound cluster. Alternatively, we could
use the logarithmic likelihood ratio ln A for testing:
if ln A &gt; 0, the n-gram is considered a compound;
it is, otherwise, considered a non-compound.

The statistics of mutual information among the
words in the n-grams, the relative frequency count
for each n-gram and the transition probabilities
of the parts of speech of the words are adopted
as the discriminative features for classification as
described in the following subsections.
Mutual Information Mutual information is a
measure of word association. It compares the
probability of a group of words to occur together
(joint probability) to their probabilities of occur-
ring independently. The bigram mutual informa-
tion is known as [Church and Hanks 1990]:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999855666666667">
P(x, y)
I(x; y) 7,- log2
P(x) x P(y)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99948525">
where x and y are two words in the corpus, and
I(x;y) is the mutual information of these two
words (in this order). The mutual information of
a trigram is defined as [Su et al. 1991]:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.980376">
I(x; y; z) 1°g2
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9455472">
where PD(x ,y, z)-=- P(x , y, z) is the probability
for x, y and z to occur jointly (Dependently), and
PI(x, y, z) is the probability for x, y and z to oc-
cur by chance (Independently), i.e., Pi(x, y, z)
P(x)x P(y)x P(z)+P(x)x P(y, , z)+ P(x , y)x P(z).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993855">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9949076">
In general, I(.) &gt;&gt; 0 implies that the words in the
n-gram are strongly associated. Otherwise, their
appearance may be simply by chance.
Relative Frequency Count The relative fre-
quency count for the ith n-gram is defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.959891">
Ii
ri =
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999203">
where f is the total number of occurrences of the
ith n-gram in the corpus, and K is the average
number of occurrence of all the entries. In other
words, f, is normalized with respect to K to get
the relative frequency. Intuitively, a frequently en-
countered word n-gram is more likely to be a com-
pound than a rarely used n-gram. Furthermore, it
may not worth the cost of entering the compound
into the dictionary if it occurs very few times. The
relative frequency count is therefore used as a fea-
ture for compound extraction.
Using both the mutual information and rel-
ative frequency count as the extraction features
is desirable since using either of these two fea-
tures alone cannot provide enough information for
compound finding. By using relative frequency
count alone, it is likely to choose the n-gram
with high relative frequency count but low as-
sociation (mutual information) among the words
comprising the n-gram. For example, if P(x)
and P(y) are very large, it may cause a large
P(x, y) even though they are not related. How-
ever, P(x,y)1 P(x) x P(y) would be small for this
case.
On the other hand, by using mutual informa-
tion alone it may be highly unreliable if P(x) and
P(y) are too small. An n-gram may have high
mutual information not because the words within
it are highly correlated but due to a large estima-
tion error. Actually, the relative frequency count
and mutual information supplement each other.
A group of words of both high relative frequency
and mutual information is most likely to be com-
posed of words which are highly correlated, and
very commonly used. Hence, such an n-gram is a
preferred compound candidate.
The distribution statistics of the training cor-
pus, excluding those n-grams that appear only
once or twice, is shown in Table 1 and 2 (MI: mu-
tual information, RFC: relative frequency count,
cc: correlation coefficient, sd: standard devia-
tion). Note that the means of mutual informa-
tion and relative frequency count of the compound
cluster are, in general, larger than those in the
non-compound cluster. The only exception is the
means of relative frequencies for trigrams. Since
almost 86.5% of the non-compound trigrams oc-
cur only once or twice, which are not considered
in estimation, the average number of occurrence
of such trigrams are smaller, and hence a larger

which only about 30.6% are excluded from consid-
eration.
Note also that mutual information and rel-
ative frequency count are almost un correlated in
both clusters since the correlation coefficients are
close to 0. Therefore, it is appropriate to take
the mutual information measure and relative fre-
quency count as two supplementary features for
compound extraction.
Parts of Speech Part of speech is a very impor-
tant feature for extracting compounds. In most
cases, part of speech of compounds has the forms:
[noun, noun] or [adjective, noun] (for bigrams)
and [noun, noun, noun], [noun, preposition, noun]
or [adjective, noun, noun] (for trigrams). There-
fore, n-gram entries which violate such syntactic
constraints should be filtered out even with high
mutual information and relative frequency count.
The precision rate of compound extraction will
then be greatly improved.
Parameter Estimation and
Smoothing
The parameters for the compound model Al, and
non-compound model Mn, can be evaluated form
a training corpus that is tagged with parts of
speech and normalized into stem forms. The cor-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995729">
244
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831296296296">
pus is divided into two parts, one as the training
corpus, and the other as the testing set. The n-
grams in the training corpus are further divided
into two clusters. The compound cluster com-
prises the n-grams already in a compound dictio-
nary, and the non-compound cluster consists of the
n-grams which are not in the dictionary. How-
ever, n-grams that occur only once or twice are
excluded from consideration because such n-grams
rarely introduce inconsistency and the estimation
of their mutual information and relative frequency
are highly unreliable.
Since each n-gram may have different part
of speech (POS) patterns Li in a corpus (e.g.,
Li = [n n] for a bigram) the mutual information
and relative frequency counts will be estimated for
each of such POS patterns. Furthermore, a partic-
ular POS pattern for an n-gram may have several
types of contextual POS&apos;s surrounding it. For ex-
ample, a left context of &apos;adj&apos; category and a right
context of &apos;n&apos; together with the above example
FOS pattern can form an extended POS pattern,
such as Lij = [a d j (n n) n], for the n-gram. By
considering all these features, the numerator fac-
tor for the log-likelihood ratio test is simplified in
the following way to make parameter estimation
feasible:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997968">
P(il/l/c) x P(Mc)
ir—i[P(ML, RL, IM) Fr; P(LijIM)] x P(Me)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998367478260869">
where n is the number of POS patterns occuring
in the text for the n-gram, ni is the number of
extended POS patterns corresponding to the
POS pattern, Li, Li, is the jth extended POS pat-
tern for Li, and ML, and RL, represent the means
of the mutual information and relative frequency
count, respectively, for n-grams with PUS pattern
Li. The denominator factor for the non-compound
cluster can be evaluated in the same way.
For simplicity, a subscript c (Inc) is used
for the parameters of the compound (/non-
compound) model, e.g., P(IM) = As-
sume that ML, and RL, are of Gaussian distribu-
tion, then the bivariate probability density func-
tion .13,(ML,RL,) for ML, and RL, can be evalu-
ated from their estimated means and standard de-
viations [Papoulis 1990]. Further simplification on
the factor P(L) is also possible. Take a bigram
for example, and assume that the probability den-
sity function depends only on the part of speech
pattern of the bigram (Ci , C2) (in this order), one
left context POS Co and one right lookahead POS
C3, the above formula can be decomposed as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.980531">
P(Lij
= Pc(Co, C1, C2, C3)
Pc(C3IC2) x Pc(C21C1) x Pc(C1 IQ) X &apos;MCP)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945052631579">
A similar formulation for trigrams with one left
context POS and one right context POS, i.e.,
Pc(Co,C1, C21 C3) C4), can be derived in a similar
way.
The n-gram entries with frequency count &lt;2
are excluded from consideration before estimating
parameters, because they introduce little inconsis-
tency problem and may introduce large estimation
error. After the distribution statistics of the two
clusters are first estimated, we calculate the means
and standard deviations of the mutual informa-
tion and relative frequency counts. The entries
with outlier values (outside the range of 3 stan-
dard deviations of the mean) are discarded for es-
timating a robust set of parameters. The factors,
like Pc(C21C1), are smoothed by adding a flatten-
ing constant 1/2 [Fienberg and Holland 1972] to
the frequency counts before the probability is es-
timated.

After all the required parameters are estimated,
both for the compound and non-compound clus-
ters, each input text is tagged with appropriate
parts of speech, and the log-likelihood function
In A for each word n-gram is evaluated. If it turns
out that ln A is greater than zero, then the n-gram
is included in the compound list. The entries in
the compound list are later sorted in the descend-
ing order of A for use by the lexicographers.
The training set consists of 12,971 sentences
(192,440 words), and the testing set has 3,243
sentences (49,314 words) from computer manu-
als. There are totally 2,517 distinct bigrams and
1,774 trigrams in the testing set, excluding n-
grams which occur less than or equal to twice.
The performance of the extraction approach for
bigrams and trigrams is shown in Table 3 and 4.
The recall and precision for the bigrams are 96.2%
and 48.2%, respectively, and they become 96.6%
and 39.6% for the trigrams. The high recall rates
show that most compounds can be captured to the
candidate list with the proposed approach. The
precision rates, on the other hand, indicate that a
real compound can be found approximately every
2 or 3 entries in the candidate list. The method
therefore provides substantial help for updating
the dictionary with little human efforts.
Note that the testing set precision of bigrams
is a little higher than the training set. This sit-
uation is unusual; it is due to the deletion of the
low frequency n-grams from consideration. For in-
stance, the number of compounds in the testing set
occupies only a very small portion (about 2.8%)
after low frequency bigrams are deleted from con-
sideration. The recall for the testing set is there-
fore higher than for the training set.

To make better trade-off between the preci-
sion rate and recall, we could adjust the threshold
for ln A. For instance, when ln A = —4 is used
for separating the two clusters, the recall will be
raised with a lower precision. On the contrary, by
raising the threshold for ln A to positive numbers,
the precision will be raised at the cost of a smaller
recall.
compounds and non-compounds. The compound
extraction problem is formulated as a two cluster
classification problem in which an n-gram is as-
signed to one of those two clusters using the like-
lihood test method. With this method, the time
for updating missing compounds can be greatly
reduced, and the consistency between different
posteditors can be maintained automatically. The
testing set performance for the bigram compounds
is 96.2% recall rate and 48.2% precision rate. For
trigrams, the recall and precision are 96.6% and

In machine translation systems, information of
the source compounds should be available before
any translation process can begin. However, since
compounds are very productive, new compounds
are created from day to day. It is obviously im-
possible to build a dictionary to contain all com-
pounds. To guarantee correct parsing and transla-

<abstract confidence="0.992567666666667">An automatic compound retrieval method is proposed to extract compounds within a text message. It uses n-gram mutual information, relative frequency count and parts of speech as the features for compound extraction. The problem is modeled as a two-class classification problem based on the distributional characteristics of n-gram tokens in the compound and the non-compound clusters. The recall and precision using the proposed approach are 96.2% and 48.2% for bigram compounds and 96.6% and 39.6% for trigram compounds for a testing corpus of 49,314 words. A significant cutdown in processing time has been observed.</abstract>
