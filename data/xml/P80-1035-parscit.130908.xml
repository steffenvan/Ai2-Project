People communicate primarily by two modes: acoustic
-- the spoken word; and visual -- the written word.
It is therefore natural that people would expect
their communications with machines to likewise use
these two modes.
To a considerable extent, speech is probably the most
natural of the natural-language modes. Hence, a
fascination exists with machines that respond to
spoken commands with synthetic speech responses to
create a natural-language interactive discourse.
However, although vast amounts of research and
development effort have been expended in the search
for systems that understand human speech and respond
with synthetic speech, the goal of the perfect system
remains aq elusive as ever. Systems for producing
natural-sounding speech for large vocabularies with
unrestricted grammatical structures and for recog-
nizing spoken speech for large vocabularies with
unlimited grammatical structures and any humber of
talkers are still beyond the state of linguistics and
computer science and technology.
Given the problems in the speech domain, it is not
surprising that most interactions between people and
machines are in the visual mode frequently using
alphanumeric keyboards as input and textual display
as output. Such visual terminals are already in
fairly widespread use in industry and are used for a
variety of applications including computer
programming, text editing, and data-base access.
The telephone allows speech telecommunications over
distance between people. Future visual terminals for
the home and businesses will allow textual
telecommunications between people. These visual
terminals could also be used to telecommunicate with
machines in a way that is presently difficult using
the telephone and speech.
Viewdata, or videotex, systems are promised soon for
the home and will allow data-base access and
transactions with machines and textual messages
between people. Some viewdata systems use elaborate
tree searches to reach the desired frame of
information. Some people believe that tree searches
will be &amp;quot;unnatural&amp;quot; for many users and some other
more-natural language will be needed to search and
access these data-base systems.
One conclusion is that the future will see more
choices in mode for telecommunications between people
and with machines. The choice of which alternate
mode will probably be dependent upon the specific
application. For example, textual messages might be
both easier to enter by keyboard and to read on a CRT
screen than speaking to a recording machine and
listening to a recorded message. However, social
chatting might be best over the telephone. However,
arranging a date with a stranger might be less
revealing if done in the textual mode. Considerable
opportunities exist for basic research to explore the
suitability of these alternate modes for different
communications applications.
The fascination of technologists with speech-synthesis
chips is about to result in a variety of stand-alone
appliances that speak. Ovens that state when the
roast is done, washing machines that call for the
addition of fabric softeners, automobiles that inform
the driver that the door is open, and many other
applications will soon abound in the marketplace. In
most of these applications, synthetic speech will
substitute for a lamp or other form of visual
display. The environment will be polluted with the
noise of buzzy synthetic speech. Many of these
applications will undoubtedly be little more than
passing fads.
But in some circumstances synthetic speech will
become the way of the future. One example would be
synthetic-speech announcements of floors in an
elevator thereby eliminating crooked necks!
Most of the preceding examples are very restricted in
terms of the language used for the interaction with
machines. The problem with unrestricted natural
language for communication with machines is that no
automatic way has yet been discovered to extract
meaning in either the speech or textual mode. The
textual mode does eliminate the need for acoustic
analysis and hence has been more extensively used in
most systems for restricted, specialized applica-
tions. However, even if either mode were equally
near perfect, questions would still arise about user
preference for one mode over the other.
Thus, in the end the future will be decided by the
votes of consumers in the marketplace as they choose
from the many options presented by technology. The
shrewd enterpreneur will use consumer preference and
needs to help illuminate in advance the desires and
needs of the marketplace. Basic research in
linguistics, human behaviour, natural language, and
other ancillary fields will have an important role in
developing solutions and in understanding people&apos;s
needs and behaviour.
