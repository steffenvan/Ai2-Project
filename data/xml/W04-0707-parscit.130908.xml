<bodyText confidence="0.9998415">
Vieira and Poesio (2000) proposed an algorithm for
definite description (DD) resolution that incorpo-
rates a number of heuristics for detecting discourse-
new descriptions. The inclusion of such detec-
tors was motivated by the observation that more
than 50% of definite descriptions (DDs) in an av-
erage corpus are discourse new (Poesio and Vieira,
1998), but whereas the inclusion of detectors for
non-anaphoric pronouns in algorithms such as Lap-
pin and Leass’ (1994) leads to clear improvements
in precision, the improvements in anaphoric DD res-
olution (as opposed to classification) brought about
by the detectors were rather small. In fact, Ng and
Cardie (2002a) challenged the motivation for the
inclusion of such detectors, reporting no improve-
ments, or even worse performance. We re-examine
the literature on the topic in detail, and propose a re-
vised algorithm, taking advantage of the improved
discourse-new detection techniques developed by
Uryupina (2003).

Although many theories of definiteness and many
anaphora resolution algorithms are based on the as-
sumption that definite descriptions are anaphoric,
in fact in most corpora at least half of definite de-
scriptions are DISCOURSE-NEW (Prince, 1992), as
shown by the following examples, both of which are
the first sentences of texts from the Penn Treebank.

Vieira and Poesio (2000) proposed an algorithm for
definite description resolution that incorporates a
number of heuristics for detecting discourse-new
(henceforth: DN) descriptions. But whereas the
inclusion of detectors for non-anaphoric pronouns
(e.g., It in It’s raining) in algorithms such as Lappin
and Leass’ (1994) leads to clear improvements in
precision, the improvements in anaphoric DD reso-
lution (as opposed to classification) brought about
by the detectors were rather small. In fact, Ng

Poesio and Vieira (1998) carried out corpus stud-
ies indicating that in corpora like the Wall Street
Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et
al., 1993), around 52% of DDs are discourse-new
(Prince, 1992), and another 15% or so are bridg-
ing references, for a total of about 66-67% first-
mention. These results led Vieira and Poesio to
propose a definite description resolution algorithm
incorporating independent heuristic strategies for
recognizing DN definite descriptions (Vieira, 1998;
Vieira and Poesio, 2000).
The heuristics proposed by Vieira and Poesio
assumed a parsed input (the Penn Treebank) and
aimed at identifying five categories of DDs licensed
to occur as first mention on semantic or pragmatic
grounds on the basis of work on definiteness includ-
ing Loebner’s account (1987):

scriptions (Loebner, 1987). This class included
descriptions with modifiers like first or best
that turned a possibly sortal predicate into a
function (as in the first person to cross the Pa-
cific on a row boat); as well as descriptions
with predicates like fact or belief followed by a
that-clause with the function of specifying the
fact or belief under question. Both types of
definites descriptions were recognized by con-
sulting a hand-coded list of SPECIAL PREDI-
CATES.
2. Descriptions serving as disguised PROPER
NAMES, such as The Federal Communications
Commission or the Iran-Iraq war. The heuris-
tics for recognizing these definite descriptions
were primarily based on capitalization (of the
head or the modifiers).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987953125">
3. PREDICATIVE descriptions, i.e., descriptions
semantically functioning as predicates rather
than as referring. These include descriptions
occurring in appositive position (as in Glenn
Cox, the president of Phillips Petroleum) and
in certain copular constructions (as in the man
most likely to gain custody ofall this is a career
politician named Dinkins). The heuristics used
to recognize these cases examined the syntac-
tic structure of the NP and the clause in which
it appeared.
4. Descriptions ESTABLISHED (i.e., turned
into functions in context) by restric-
tive modification, particularly by es-
tablishing relative clauses (Loebner,
1987) and prepositional phrases, as in

the sun, the pope or the long distance mar-
ket which denote uniquely on the grounds of
shared knowledge about the situation (these are
Loebner’s ‘situational functions’). Vieira and
Poesio’s system had a small list of such defi-
nites.
These heuristics were included as tests both of a de-
cision tree concerned only with the task of DN de-
tection, and of decision trees determining the classi-
fication of DDs as anaphoric, bridging or discourse
new. In both cases, the DN detection tests were in-
tertwined with attempts to identify an antecedent for
such DDs. Both hand-coded decision trees and auto-
matically acquired ones (trained using ID3, (Quin-
lan, 1986)) were used for the task of two-way clas-
sification into discourse-new and anaphoric. Vieira
and Poesio found only small differences in the order
of tests in the two decision trees, and small differ-
ences in performance. The hand-coded decision tree
executes in the following order:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.934455916666667">
1. Try the DN heuristics with the highest accu-
racy (recognition of some types of semanti-
cally functional DDs using special predicates,
and of potentially predicative DDs occurring in
appositions);
2. Otherwise, attempt to resolve the DD as direct
anaphora;
3. Otherwise, attempt the remaining DN heuris-
tics in the order: proper names, descrip-
tions established by relatives and PPs, proper
name modification, predicative DDs occurring
in copular constructions.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820461538462">
If none of these tests succeeds, the algorithm can ei-
ther leave the DD unclassified, or classify it as DN.
The automatically learned decision tree attempts di-
rect anaphora resolution first. The overall results on
the 195 DDs on which the automatically trained de-
cision tree was tested are shown in Table 1. The
baseline is the result achieved by classifying every
DD as discourse-new–with 99 discourse-new DDs
out of 195, this means a precision of 50.8%. Two
results are shown for the hand-coded decision tree:
in one version, the system doesn’t attempt to clas-
sify all DDs; in the other, all unclassified DDs are
classified as discourse-new.

Bean and Riloff(1999) developed a system for iden-
tifying discourse-new DDs1 that incorporates, in ad-
dition to syntax-based heuristics aimed at recogniz-
ing predicative and established DDs using postmod-
ification heuristics similar to those used by Vieira
and Poesio, additional techniques for mining from
corpora unfamiliar DDs including proper names,

of the techniques proposed by Bean and Riloff are
particularly worth noticing. The SENTENCE-ONE
(S1) EXTRACTION heuristic identifies as discourse-
new every DD found in the first sentence of a text.
More general patterns can then be extracted from
the DDs initially found by S1-extraction, using the
EXISTENTIAL HEAD PATTERN method which, e.g.,
would extract the N+ Government from the
Salvadoran Government and the Guatemalan Gov-
ernment. The DEFINITE ONLY (DO) list contained
NPs like the National Guard or the FBI with a high
DEFINITE PROBABILITY, i.e., whose nominal com-
plex has been encountered at least 5 times with the
definite article, but never with the indefinite. VAC-
CINES were also developed that prevented the use
of patterns identified by S1-extraction or DO-list el-
ements when the definite probability of the definite
was too low. Overall, the algorithm proposed by
Bean and Riloff is as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.956395416666667">
1. If the head noun of the DD appeared earlier in
the text, classify as anaphoric.
2. Otherwise, if the DD occurs in the S1 list, clas-
sify as discourse-new unless stopped by vac-
cine.
3. Otherwise, classify the DD as DN if one of the
following tests applies:
(a) it occurs in the DO list;
(b) it matches one of the EHP patterns, and is
not stopped by vaccine;
(c) it matches one of the syntactic heuristics
4. Otherwise, classify the DD as anaphoric.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998744">
(Note that as in the machine-learned version of the
Vieira and Poesio decision tree, a (simplified) direct
anaphora test is tried first, followed by DN detectors
in decreasing order of accuracy.)
Bean and Riloff trained their system on 1600 ar-
ticles from MUC-4, and tested it on 50 texts. The
S1 extraction methods produced 849 DDs; the DO
list contained 65 head nouns and 321 full NPs. The
overall results are shown in Table 2; the baseline
are the results obtained when classifying all DDs as
discourse-new.
Although the overall precision is not better than
what obtained with the partial hand-coded decision
tree used by Vieira and Poesio, recall is substantially
improved.

coreference resolution system (specifically, the sys-
tem discussed in (Ng and Cardie, 2002b)). Ng and
Cardie’s work differs from the work discussed so far
in that their system attempts to deal with all types of
NPs, not just definite descriptions.
The discourse-new detectors proposed by Ng and
Cardie are statistical classifiers taking as input 37
features and trained using either C4.5 (Quinlan,
1993) or RIPPER (Cohen, 1995). The 37 features
of a candidate anaphoric expression specify, in ad-
dition to much of the information proposed in pre-
vious work, a few new types of information about
NPs.
• The four boolean so-called LEXICAL features
are actually string-level features: for exam-
ple, str_match is Y if a preceding NP
string-matches the anaphoric expression (ex-
cept for the determiner), and head_match =
Y if a preceding NP’s head string-matches the
anaphoric expression’s. embedded=Y if the
anaphoric expression is a prenominal modifier.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.884672526315789">
• The second group of 11 (mostly boolean) fea-
tures specifies the type of NP: e.g., pronoun
is Y if the anaphoric expression is a pronoun,
else N.
• The third group of 7 features specifies syn-
tactic properties of the anaphoric expression,
including number, whether NPS is the first of
two NPs in an appositive or predicative con-
struction, whether NPS is pre- or post-modified,
whether it contains a proper noun, and whether
it is modified by a superlative.
• The next group of 8 features are mostly novel,
and capture information not used by previ-
ous DN detectors about the exact composition
of definite descriptions: e.g., the_2n=Y if
the anaphoric expression starts with deter-
miner the followed by exactly two common
nouns, the_num_n=Y if the anaphoric ex-
pression starts with determiner the followed

starts with determiner the followed by a singu-
lar NP not containing a proper noun.

<listItem confidence="0.967392444444445">
• The next group of features consists of 4 fea-
tures capturing a variety of ‘semantic’ infor-
mation, including whether a previous NP is an
‘alias’ of NPS, or whether NPS is the title of a
person (the president).
• Finally, the last three features capture informa-
tion about the position in the text in which NPS
occurs: the header, the first sentence, or the
first paragraph.

Ng and Cardie’s discourse-new predictor was
trained and tested over the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coref-
erence data sets, achieving accuracies of 86.1% and
84%, respectively, against a baseline of 63.8% and
73.2%, respectively. Inspection of the top parts
of the decision tree produced with the MUC-6 sug-
gests that head_match is the most important fea-
ture, followed by the features specifying NP type,
the alias feature, and the features specifying the
structure of definite descriptions.
Ng and Cardie discuss two architectures for the
integration of a DN detector in a coreference sys-
tem. In the first architecture, the DN detector is
run first, and the coreference resolution algorithm
is run only if the DN detector classifies that NP as
anaphoric. In the second architecture, the system
first computes str_match and alias, and runs
the anaphoric resolver if any of them is Y; other-
wise, it proceeds as in the first architecture. The
results obtained on the MUC-6 data with the base-
line anaphoric resolver, the anaphoric resolver aug-
mented by a DN detector as in the first architecture,
and as in the second architecture (using C4.5), are
shown in Table 3. The results for all NPs, pronouns
only, proper names only, and common nouns only
are shown.2
As indicated in the Table, running the DN detector
first leads to worse results–this is because the detec-
tor misclassifies a number of anaphoric NPs as non-
anaphoric. However, looking first for a same-head
antecedent leads to a statistically significant im-
provement over the results of the baseline anaphoric
resolver. This confirms the finding both of Vieira
and Poesio and of Bean and Riloff that the direct
anaphora should be called very early.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.51925625">
2It’s not clear to us why the overall performance of the algo-
rithm is much better than the performance on the three individ-
ual types of anaphoric expressions considered–i.e., which other
anaphoric expressions are handled by the coreference resolver.

<bodyText confidence="0.999954833333334">
Uryupina (2003) trained two separate classifiers (us-
ing RIPPER, (Cohen, 1995)): a DN detector and a
UNIQUENESS DETECTOR, i.e., a classifier that de-
termines whether an NP refers to a unique object.
This is useful to identify proper names (like 1998,
or the United States ofAmerica), semantic definites
(like the chairman ofMicrosoft) and larger situation
definite descriptions (like the pope). Both classi-
fiers use the same set of 32 features. The features of
an NP encode, first, of all, string-level information:
e.g., whether the NP contains capitalized words, dig-
its, or special symbols. A second group of features
specifies syntactic information: whether the NP is
postmodified, and whether it contains an apposition.
Two types of appositions are distinguished, with and
without commas. CONTEXT features specify the
distance between the NP and the previous NP with
the same head, if any. Finally, Uryupina’s system
computes four features specifying the NP’s definite
probability. Unlike the definite probability used by
Bean and Riloff, these features are computed from
the Web, using Altavista. From each NP, its head H
and entire NP without determiner Y are determined,
and four ratios are then computed:

7 (a subset of the second data set used by Ng and

used for training and for tuning RIPPER’s parame-
ters, one for testing. The results for the discourse
new detection task are shown in Table 4, separat-
ing the results for all NPs and definite NPs only,

2.5 Summary

<bodyText confidence="0.999740666666666">
Quite a lot of consensus on many of the factors play-
ing a role in DN detection for DDs. Most of the al-
gorithms discussed above incorporate methods for:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994592333333333">
• recognizing predicative DDs;
• recognizing discourse-new proper names;
• identifying functional DDs;
• recognizing DDs modified by establishing rel-
atives (which may or may not be discourse-
new).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999608695652174">
There is also consensus on the fact that DN detection
cannot be isolated from anaphoric resolution (wit-
ness the Ng and Cardie results).
One problem with some of the machine learning
approaches to coreference is that these systems do
not achieve very good results on pronoun and defi-
nite description resolution in comparison with spe-
cialized algorithms: e.g., although Ng and Cardie’s
best version achieves F=65.8 on all anaphoric ex-
pressions, it only achieves F=29.6 for definite de-
scriptions (cfr. Vieira and Poesio’s best result of
F=77), and F=28.2 for pronouns (as opposed to re-
sults as high as F=80 obtained by the pronoun res-
olution algorithms evaluated in (Tetreault, 2001)).
Clearly these systems can only be properly com-
pared by evaluating them all on the same corpora
and the same data, and discussion such as (Mitkov,
2000) suggest caution in interpreting some of the
results discussed in the literature as pre- and post-
processing often plays a crucial role, but we feel that
evaluating DN detectors in conjunction with high-
performing systems would give a better idea of the
improvements that one may hope to achieve.

3 Do Discourse-New Detectors Help?
Preliminary Evaluations

<bodyText confidence="0.999937789473685">
Vieira and Poesio did not test their system with-
out DN-detection, but Ng and Cardie’s results indi-
cate that DN detection does improve results, if not
dramatically, provided that the same_head test is
run first–although their DN detector does not appear
to improve results for pronouns, the one category
for which detection of non-anaphoricity has been
shown to be essential (Lappin and Leass, 1994). In
order to evaluate how much improvement can we
expect by just improving the DN detector, we did
a few preliminary evaluations both with a reimple-
mentation of Vieira and Poesio’s algorithm which
does not include a discourse-new detector, running
over treebank text as the original algorithm, and
with a simple statistical coreference resolver at-
tempting to resolve all anaphoric expressions and
running over unparsed text, using Uryupina’s fea-
tures for discourse-new detection, and over the same
corpus used by Ng and Cardie (MUC-7).

GUITAR (Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004)
is a general-purpose anaphoric resolver that in-
cludes an implementation of the Vieira / Poesio al-
gorithm for definite descriptions and of Mitkov’s al-
gorithm for pronoun resolution (Mitkov, 1998). It is
implemented in Java, takes its input in XML format
and returns as output its input augmented with the
anaphoric relations it has discovered. GUITAR has
been implemented in such a way as to be fully mod-
ular, making it possible, for example, to replace the
DD resolution method with alternative implementa-
tions. It includes a pre-processor incorporating a
chunker so that it can run over both hand-parsed and
raw text.
A version of GUITAR without the DN detection
aspects of the Vieira / Poesio algorithm was evalu-
ated on the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000; Poesio et
al., 2004), which contains 554 definite descriptions,
of which 180 anaphoric, and 305 third-person pro-
nouns, of which 217 anaphoric. The results for defi-
nite descriptions over hand-parsed text are shown in

GUITAR without a DN recognizer takes 182 DDs
(Res) as anaphoric, resolving 121 of them cor-
rectly (Corr); of the 182 DDs it attempts to resolve,
only 16 are incorrectly resolved (WM); almost three
times that number (45) are Spurious Matches (SM),
i.e., discourse-new DDs incorrectly interpreted as
anaphoric. (Res=Corr+WM+SM.) The system can’t
find an antecedent for 43 of the 180 anaphoric DDs.
When endowed with a perfect DN detector, GUI-
TAR could achieve a precision P=88.3 which, as-
suming recall stays the same (R=67.2) would mean
a F=76.3.
Of course, these results are obtained assuming
perfect parsing. For a fairer comparison with the
results of Ng and Cardie, we report in Table 7 the
results for both pronouns and definite descriptions
obtained by running GUITAR off raw text.

simple statistical coreference resolver?
In order to have an even closer comparison with
the results of Ng and Cardie, we implemented a
simple statistical coreference system, that, like Ng
and Cardie’s system, would resolve all types of
anaphoric expressions, and would run over unparsed
text, but without DN detection. We ran the system
over the MUC-7 data used by Ng and Cardie, and
compared the results with those obtained by using
perfect knowledge about discourse novelty. The re-
sults are shown in Table 8.

These results suggest that a DN detector could
lead to substantial improvements for coreference
resolution in general: DN detection might improve
precision by more than 30%, which more than
makes up for the slight deterioration in recall. Of
course, this test alone doesn’t tell us how much im-
provement DN detection would bring to a higher-
performance anaphoric resolver.

4 A New Set of Features for
Discourse-New Detection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956879517241379">
Next, we developed a new set of features for dis-
course new detection that takes into account the
findings of the work on DN detection discussed in
the previous sections. This set of features will be
input to an anaphoric resolver for DDs working in
two steps. For each DD,
1. The direct anaphora resolution algorithm from
(Vieira and Poesio, 2000) is run, which at-
tempts to find an head-matching antecedent
within a given window and taking premodifica-
tion into account. The results of the algorithm
(i.e., whether an antecedent was found) is used
as one of the input features of the classifier in
the next step. In addition, a number of features
of the DD that may help recognizing the classes
of DDs discussed above are extracted from the
input. Some of these features are computed ac-
cessing the Web via the Google API.
2. A decision tree classifier is used to classify the
DD as anaphoric (in which case the antecedents
identified at the first step are also returned) or
discourse-new.
The features input to the classifier can be catego-
rized as follows:
Anaphora A single feature,
direct-anaphora, specifying the distance
of the (same-head) antecedent from the DD, if
any (values: none, zero, one, more)
Predicative NPs Two boolean features:

Data We are using three corpora for the evalua-
tion, including texts from different genres, in which
all anaphoric relations between (all types of) NPs are
marked. The GNOME corpus includes pharmaceuti-
cal leaflets and museum ’labels’ (i.e., descriptions
of museum objects and of the artists that realized
them). As said above, the corpus contains 554 def-
inite descriptions. In addition, we are using the 14
texts from the Penn Treebank included in the cor-
pus used by Vieira and Poesio. We transferred these
texts to XML format, and added anaphoric informa-
tion for all types of NPs according to the GNOME
scheme. Finally, we are testing the system on the
MUC-7 data used by Ng and Cardie

Ng and Cardie’s work differs from the work discussed so far in that their system attempts to deal with all types of NPs, not just definite descriptions. The discourse-new detectors proposed by Ng and Cardie are statistical classifiers taking as input 37 features and trained using either C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) or RIPPER (Cohen, 1995). The 37 features of a candidate anaphoric expression specify, in addition to much of the information proposed in previous work, a few new types of information about NPs. • The four boolean so-called LEXICAL features are actually string-level features: for example, str_match is Y if a preceding NP string-matches the anaphoric expression (except for the determiner), and head_match = Y if a preceding NP’s head string-matches the anaphoric expression’s. embedded=Y if the anaphoric expression is a prenominal modifier. • The second group of 11 (mostly boolean) features specifies the type of NP: e.g</context>

This is useful to identify proper names (like 1998, or the United States ofAmerica), semantic definites (like the chairman ofMicrosoft) and larger situation definite descriptions (like the pope). Both classifiers use the same set of 32 features. The features of an NP encode, first, of all, string-level information: e.g., whether the NP contains capitalized words, digits, or special symbols.

Preliminary Evaluations Vieira and Poesio did not test their system without DN-detection, but Ng and Cardie’s results indicate that DN detection does improve results, if not dramatically, provided that the same_head test is run first–although their DN detector does not appear to improve results for pronouns, the one category for which detection of non-anaphoricity has been shown to be essential (Lappin and Leass, 1994). In order to evaluate how much improvement can we expect by just improving the DN detector, we did a few preliminary evaluations both with a reimplementation of Vieira and Poesio’s algorithm which does not include a discourse-new detector, running over treebank text as the original algorithm, and with a simple statistical coreference resolver attempting to resolve all anaphoric expressions and running over unparsed text, using Uryupina’s features for discourse-new detection, and over the same corpus used by Ng and Cardie (MUC-7). 3.1 How much does DN-detection help the Vieira / Poesio algorit</context>

So-called SEMANTICALLY FUNCTIONAL descriptions (Loebner, 1987). This class included descriptions with modifiers like first or best that turned a possibly sortal predicate into a function (as in the first person to cross the Pacific on a row boat); as well as descriptions with predicates like fact or belief followed by a that-clause with the function of specifying the fact or belief under question. Both types of definites descriptions were recognized by consulting a hand-coded list of SPECIAL PREDICATES. 2.

GUITAR (Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004) is a general-purpose anaphoric resolver that includes an implementation of the Vieira / Poesio algorithm for definite descriptions and of Mitkov’s algorithm for pronoun resolution (Mitkov, 1998). It is implemented in Java, takes its input in XML format and returns as output its input augmented with the anaphoric relations it has discovered. GUITAR has been implemented in such a way as to be fully modular, making it possible, for example, to replace the DD resolution method with alternative implementations. It includes a pre-processor incorporating a chunker so that it can run over both hand-parsed and raw text. A version of GUITAR without the DN detection aspects of the Vieira / Poesio algorithm was evaluated on the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000; Poesio et al., 2004), which contains 554</context>

Vieira and Poesio’s best result of F=77), and F=28.2 for pronouns (as opposed to results as high as F=80 obtained by the pronoun resolution algorithms evaluated in (Tetreault, 2001)). Clearly these systems can only be properly compared by evaluating them all on the same corpora and the same data, and discussion such as (Mitkov, 2000) suggest caution in interpreting some of the results discussed in the literature as pre- and postprocessing often plays a crucial role, but we feel that evaluating DN detectors in conjunction with highperforming systems would give a better idea of the improvements that one may hope to achieve. 3 Do Discourse-New Detectors Help?

This set of features will be input to an anaphoric resolver for DDs working in two steps. For each DD, 1. The direct anaphora resolution algorithm from (Vieira and Poesio, 2000) is run, which attempts to find an head-matching antecedent within a given window and taking premodification into account. The results of the algorithm (i.e., whether an antecedent was found) is used as one of the input features of the classifier in the next step.

In both cases, the DN detection tests were intertwined with attempts to identify an antecedent for such DDs. Both hand-coded decision trees and automatically acquired ones (trained using ID3, (Quinlan, 1986)) were used for the task of two-way classification into discourse-new and anaphoric. Vieira and Poesio found only small differences in the order of tests in the two decision trees, and small differences in performance. The hand-coded decision tree executes in the following order: 1. Try the DN heuristics with the highest accuracy (recognition of some types of semantically functional DDs using special predicates, and of potentially predicative DDs occurring in appositions); 2.

The discourse-new detectors proposed by Ng and Cardie are statistical classifiers taking as input 37 features and trained using either C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) or RIPPER (Cohen, 1995). The 37 features of a candidate anaphoric expression specify, in addition to much of the information proposed in previous work, a few new types of information about NPs. • The four boolean so-called LEXICAL features are actually string-level features: for example, str_match is Y if a preceding NP string-matches the anaphoric expression (except for the determiner), and head_match = Y if a preceding NP’s head string-matches the anaphoric expression’s. embedded=Y if the anaphoric expression is a prenominal modifier. • The second group of 11 (mostly boolean) features speci</context>

One problem with some of the machine learning approaches to coreference is that these systems do not achieve very good results on pronoun and definite description resolution in comparison with specialized algorithms: e.g., although Ng and Cardie’s best version achieves F=65.8 on all anaphoric expressions, it only achieves F=29.6 for definite descriptions (cfr. Vieira and Poesio’s best result of F=77), and F=28.2 for pronouns (as opposed to results as high as F=80 obtained by the pronoun resolution algorithms evaluated in (Tetreault, 2001)). Clearly these systems can only be properly compared by evaluating them all on the same corpora and the same data, and discussion such as (Mitkov, 2000) suggest caution in interpreting some of the results discussed in the literature as pre- and postprocessing often plays a crucial role, but we feel that evaluating DN detectors in conjunction with highperforming systems would give a better idea of the improvements that one may hope to achieve. 3 Do Discourse-New Detectors Help?

This is useful to identify proper names (like 1998, or the United States ofAmerica), semantic definites (like the chairman ofMicrosoft) and larger situation definite descriptions (like the pope).

The heuristics proposed by Vieira and Poesio assumed a parsed input (the Penn Treebank) and aimed at identifying five categories of DDs licensed to occur as first mention on semantic or pragmatic grounds on the basis of work on definiteness including Loebner’s account (1987): 1. So-called SEMANTICALLY FUNCTIONAL descriptions (Loebner, 1987). This class included descriptions with modifiers like first or best that turned a possibly sortal predicate into a function (as in the first person to cross the Pacific on a row boat); as well as descriptions with predicates like fact or belief followed b</context>

Of course, this test alone doesn’t tell us how much improvement DN detection would bring to a higherperformance anaphoric resolver. 4 A New Set of Features for Discourse-New Detection Next, we developed a new set of features for discourse new detection that takes into account the findings of the work on DN detection discussed in the previous sections. This set of features will be input to an anaphoric resolver for DDs working in two steps. For each DD, 1. The direct anaphora resolution algorithm from (Vieira and Poesio, 2000) is run, which attempts to find an head-matching antecedent within a given window and taking premodification into account. The results of the algorithm (i.e., whether an antecedent was found) is used as one of the input features of the classifier in the next step. In addition, a number of features of the DD that may help recognizing the classes of DDs discussed above are extracted from the input. Some of these features are computed accessing the Web via the Google API. 2. A decision tree classifier is used to classify the DD as anaphoric (in which case the antecedents identified at the first s</context>
