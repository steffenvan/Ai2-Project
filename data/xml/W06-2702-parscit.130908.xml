<bodyText confidence="0.9998415">
Publishers of biomedical journals in-
creasingly use XML as the underlying
document format. We present a modular
text-processing pipeline that inserts XML
markup into such documents in every
processing step, leading to multi-dimen-
sional markup. The markup introduced
is used to identify and disambiguate
named entities of several semantic types
(protein/gene, Gene Ontology terms,
drugs and species) and to communicate
data from one module to the next. Each
module independently adds, changes or
removes markup, which allows for mod-
ularization and a flexible setup of the
processing pipeline. We also describe
how the cascaded approach is embedded
in a large-scale XML-based application
(EBIMed) used for on-line access to bio-
medical literature. We discuss the les-
sons learnt so far, as well as the open
problems that need to be resolved. In
particular, we argue that the pragmatic
and tailored solutions allow for reduction
in the need for overlapping annotations
— although not completely without cost.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9992284">
Publishers of biomedical journals have widely
adopted XML as the underlying format from
which other formats, such as PDF and HTML,
are generated. For example, documents in XML
format are available from the National Library of
Medicine1 (Medline abstracts and Pubmed2 Cent-
ral documents), and from BioMed Central3 (full
text journal articles). Other publishers are head-
ing into the same direction. Such documents
contain logical markup to organize meta-inform-

ation such as title, author(s), sections, headings,
citations, references, etc. Inside the text of a
document, XML is used for physical markup,
e.g. text in italic or boldface, subscript and super-
script insertions, etc. Manually generated se-
mantic markup is available only on the document
level (e.g. MeSH terms).
One of the most distinguished feature of sci-
entific biomedical literature is that it contains a
large amount of terms and entities, the majority
of which are explained in public electronic data-
bases. Terms (such as names of genes, proteins,
gene products, organisms, drugs, chemical com-
pounds, etc.) are a key factor for accessing and
integrating the information stored in literature
(Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004). Identifica-
tion and markup of names and terms in text
serves several purposes:
(1) The users profit from highlighted semantic
types, e.g. protein/gene, drug, species, and from
links to the defining database for immediate ac-
cess and exploration.
(2) Identified terms facilitate and improve stat-
istical and NLP based text analysis (Hirschman
et al., 2005; Kirsch et al., 2005).
In this paper we describe a cascaded approach
to named-entity recognition (NER) and markup
in biomedicine that is embedded into EBIMed4,
an on-line service to access the literature (Reb-
holz-Schuhmann et al., forthcoming). EBIMed
facilitates both purposes mentioned above. It
keeps the annotations provided by publishers and
inserts XML annotations while processing the
text. Named entities from different resources are
identified in the text. The individual modules
provide annotation of protein names with unique
identifiers, disambiguation of protein names that
are ambiguous acronyms, annotation of drugs,
Gene Ontology5 terms and species. The identi-
fication of protein named entities can be further
used in an alternative pipeline to identify events

such as protein-protein interactions and associ-

al., 1999; Rzhetsky et al., 2004; Rebholz-Schuh-
mann et al., 2004; Nenadic and Ananiadou,
2006).
The rest of the paper is organised as follows.
In Section 2 we briefly discuss problems with
biomedical NER. The cascaded approach and an
online text mining system are described in sec-
tions 3 and 4 respectively. We discuss the les-
sons learnt from the on-line application and re-
mainig open problems in Section 5, while con-

2 Biomedical Named Entity Recognition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999061891891892">
Terms and named-entities (NEs) are the means
of scientific communication as they are used to
identify the main concepts in a domain. The
identification of terminology in the biomedical
literature is one of the most challenging research
topics both in the NLP and biomedical com-
munities (Hirschman et al., 2005; Kirsch et al.,
2005).
Identification of named entities (NEs) in a
document can be viewed as a three-step proced-
ure (Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004). In the
first step, single or multiple adjacent words that
indicate the presence of domain concepts are re-
cognised (term recognition). In the second step,
called term categorisation, the recognised terms
are classified into broader domain classes (e.g. as
genes, proteins, species). The final step is map-
ping of terms into referential databases. The first
two steps are commonly referred to as named en-
tity recognition (NER).
One of the main challenges in NER is a huge
number of new terms and entities that appear in
the biomedical domain. Further, terminological
variation, recognition of boundaries of multiword
terms, identification of nested terms and ambigu-
ity of terms are the difficult issues when mapping
terms from the literature to biomedical database
entries (Hirschman et al., 2005; Krauthammer
and Nenadic, 2004).
On one hand, NER in the biomedical domain
(in particular the recognition part) profits from
large, freely available terminological resources,
which are either provided as ontologies (e.g.
Gene Ontology, ChEBI6, UMLS7) or result from
biomedical databases containing named entities
(e.g. UniProt/Swiss-Prot8). On the other hand,
combining sets of terms from different termino-

2003).
logical resources leads to naming conflicts such
as homonymous use of names and terminological
ambiguities. The most obvious problem is when
the same span of text is assigned to different se-
mantic types (e.g. ‘rat’ denotes a species and a
protein). In this case, there are three types of am-
biguities:
(Amb1) A name is used for different entries in
the same database, e.g. the same protein name
serves for a given protein in different species
(Chen et al., 2005).
(Amb2) A name is used for entries in multiple
databases and thus represents different types, e.g.
‘rat’ is a protein and a species.
(Amb3) A name is not only used as a biomed-
ical term but also as part of common English (in
contrast to the biomedical terminology), e.g.
‘who’ and ‘how’, which are used as protein
names.
In some cases (i.e. Amb2), broader classifica-
tion can help to disambiguate between different
entries (e.g. differentiate between ‘CAT’ as a
protein, animal or medical device). However, it
is ineffective in situations where names can be
mapped to several different entries in the same
data source. In such situations, disambiguation
on the resource level is needed (see, for example,
(Liu et al., 2002) for disambiguation of terms as-
sociated with several entries in the UMLS Meta-
thesaurus).
In many solutions, the three steps in biomedic-
al NER (namely, recognition, categorisation and
mapping to databases) are merged within one
module. For example, using an existing termino-
logical database for recognition of NEs, effect-
ively leads to complete term identification (in
cases where there are no ambiguities). Some re-
searchers, however, have stressed the advantages
of tackling each step as a separate task, pointing
at different sources and methods needed to ac-
complish each of the subtasks (Torii et al., 2003;
Lee et al., 2003). Also, in the case of modularisa-
tion, it is easier to integrate different solutions
for each specific problem. However, it has been
suggested that whether a clear separation into
single steps would improve term identification is
an open issue (Krauthammer and Nenadic,
2004). In this paper we discuss a cascaded, mod-
ular approach to biomedical NER.

several biomedical semantic types in the text.
Full identification of NEs and resolving ambigu-
ities in particular, may require a full parse tree of
a sentence in addition to the analysis of local
context information. On the other hand, full
parse trees may be only derivable after NEs are
resolved. Methods to efficiently overcome these
problems are not yet available today and in order
to come up with an applicable solution, it was
necessary to choose a more pragmatic approach.
We first discuss the basic principles and
design of the processing pipeline, which is based
on a pragmatic cascade of modules, and then
present each of the modules separately.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.537391">
3.1 Modular design of a text processing
pipeline
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992868">
Our methodology is based on the idea of separat-
ing the process into clearly defined functions ap-
plied one after another to text, in a processing
pipeline characterized by the following state-
ments:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.806926157894737">
(P1) The complete text processing task con-
sists of separate and independent modules.
(P2) The task is performed by running all
modules exactly once in a fixed sequence.
(P3) Each module operates continuously on an
input stream and performs its function on
stretches or “windows” of text that are usually
much smaller than the whole input. As soon as a
window is processed, the module produces the
resulting output.
(P4) After the startup phase, all modules run
in parallel. Incoming requests for annotation are
accepted by a master process that ensures that all
required modules are approached in the right or-
der.
(P5) Communication of information between
the modules is strictly downstream and all meta-
information is contained in the data stream itself
in the form of XML markup.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996512">
An instance of a processing pipeline (which is
actually embedded in EBIMed) is presented in
Figure 1. The modules M-1 to M-8 are run in this
order, and no communication between them is
needed apart from streaming the text from the
output of one module to the input of another.
The text contains the meta-data as XML markup.
The modules are described below.

EBIMed
Although this is the standard pipeline for
EBIMed, it is possible to re-arrange the modules
to favour identification of specific semantic
types. More precisely, in our modular approach,
after identification of a term in the text, disam-
biguation only decides whether the term is of that
type or not. If it is not, the specific annotation is
removed and left to the downstream modules to
tag the term differently. While this requires n
identification steps, adding identification of new
types is independent of modules already present.
However, the prioritization of semantic types is
enforced by the order of the associated term
identification modules.

3.2 Input documents and pre-processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989428571429">
Input documents are XML-formatted Medline
abstracts as provided from the National Library
of Medicine (NLM). The XML structure of
Medline abstracts includes meta information at-
tached to the original document, such as the
journal, author list, affiliations, publication dates
as well as annotations inserted by the NLM such
as creation date of the Medline entry, list of
chemicals associated with the document, as well
as related MeSH headings.
The text processing modules are only con-
cerned with the document parts that consist of
natural language text. In Medline abstracts,
these stretches of text are marked up as Article-
Title and AbstractText. Inside these elements we
add another XML element, called text, to flag
natural language text independent of the original
input document format (module M-1 in Figure
1). Thereby the subsequent text processing mod-
ules become independent of the document struc-
ture: other document types, e.g. BioMed Central

As a final pre-processing step (M-2), sen-
tences are identified and marked using the

3.3 Finding protein names in text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990086956522">
For identification of protein names (M-3 in Fig-
ure 1), we use an existing protein repository.
UniProt/Swiss-Prot contains roughly 190,000
protein/gene names (PGNs) in database entries
that also annotate proteins with protein function,
species and tissue type. PGNs from
UniProt/Swiss-Prot are matched with regular ex-
pressions which account for morphological vari-
ability. These terms are tagged using the &lt;z:uni-
prot&gt; tag (see Figure 2). The list of identifiers
(ids attribute) contains the accession numbers of
the mentioned protein in the UniProt/Swiss-Prot
database. All synonyms from a database entry
are kept, and in the case of homonymy, where
one name refers to several database entries, all
accession numbers are stored. The pair consist-
ing of the database name and the accession num-
ber(s) forms a unique identifier (UID) that rep-
resents the semantics of the term and can be
trivially rewritten into a URL pointing to the
database entry. Each entity also contains the at-
tribute fb which provides the frequency of the
term in the British National Corpus (BNC).

3.4 Resolving (some) protein name ambigu-
ities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999788842105263">
The approach to finding names that we presented
can create three types of ambiguities mentioned
above in Section 2.
In the current implementation, Amb1 (ambi-
guity within a given resource) is not resolved.
Rather, the links to all entries in the same data-
base are maintained. Amb2 and Amb3 are par-
tially resolved for protein/gene names as ex-
plained below (steps M-4 and M-5). Note that
Amb2 is resolved on “first-come first-serve”
basis, meaning that an annotation introduced by
one module is not overwritten by a subsequent
module.
Many protein names are indeed or at least look
like abbreviations. It has been proved that ambi-
guities of abbreviations and acronyms found in
Medline abstracts can be automatically resolved
with high accuracy (Yu et al., 2002; Schwartz
and Hearst, 2003; Gaudan et al., 2005).

In our approach (Gaudan et al., 2005) all ac-
ronyms from Medline have been gathered togeth-
er
with their expanded forms, called senses. In ad-
dition all morphological and syntactical variants
of a known expanded form have been extracted
from Medline. Expanded forms were categor-
ised into classes of semantically equivalent
forms. Feature representations of Medline ab-
stracts containing the acronym and the expanded
form were used to train support vector machines
(SVMs). Disambiguation of acronyms to their
senses in Medline abstracts based on the SVMs
was achieved at an accuracy of above 98%. This
was independent from the presence of the expan-
ded form in the Medline abstract. This disam-
biguation solution lead to the solution integrated
into the processing pipeline.
A potential protein has to be evaluated against
three possible outcomes: either a name is an ac-
ronym and can be resolved as (a) a protein or (b)
not a protein, or (c) a name cannot be resolved.
To distinguish cases (a) and (b) the document
content is processed to identify the expanded
form of the acronym and to check whether the
expanded form refers to a protein name. In case
of (c), the frequency of the name in the British
National Corpus (BNC) is compared with a
threshold. If the frequency is higher than the
threshold, the name is assumed not to be a pro-
tein name. The threshold was chosen not to ex-
clude important protein names that have already
entered common English (such as insulin).
The disambiguation module (M-4) runs on the
results of the previous module that performs pro-
tein-name matching and indiscriminately as-
sumes each match to be a protein name. The
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999947888888889">
module M-4 marks up all known acronym ex-
pansions in the text and combines the two pieces
of information: a marked up protein name is
looked up in the list of abbreviations. If the ab-
breviation has an expansion that is marked up in
the vicinity and denotes a protein name, the ab-
breviation is verified as a protein name (case (a)
above) by adding an attribute with a suitable
value to the protein tag. The annotation also in-
cludes the normalised form of the acronym,
which serves as an identifier for further database
lookups. Similarly, if the expansion is clearly not
a protein name, the same attribute is used with
the according value.
Finally, the module M-5 removes the protein
name markup if the name is either (b) clearly not
a protein, or in case (c) has a BNC frequency
beyond the threshold.

<bodyText confidence="0.999952409090909">
Further modules (M-6, M-7 and M-8 in Fig. 1)
perform matching and markup for drugs from
MedlinePlus9, species from Entrez Taxonomy10
and terms from the Gene Ontology (GO). As for
proteins, the semantic type is signified by the
element name and a unique ID referencing the
source database is added as an attribute. Disam-
biguation for these names and terms is, however,
not yet available.
Finding GO ontology terms in text can be dif-
ficult, as these names are typically “descriptions”
rather than real terms (e.g. GO:0016886, ligase
activity, forming phosporic ester bonds), and
therefore are not likely to appear in text fre-
quently (McCray et al., 2002; Verspoor et al.,
2003; Nenadic et al., 2004).

notated for semantic types and POS information

POS tags are inside the type tags although type
annotation has been performed prior to the POS

The modular text processing pipeline of EBIMed
is currently being extended to include other mod-

separate module and combines tokenization and
POS annotation. It leaves previously annotated
entities as single tokens, even for multi-word
terms, and assigns a noun POS tag to every
named entity.

Shallow parsing is introduced as another layer
in the multidimensional annotation of biomedical
documents. After the NER modules, the shallow
parsing modules extract events of protein-protein
interactions. Shallow parsing basically annotates
noun phrases (NP) and verb groups. Noun
phrases that contain a protein name receive a
modified NP tag (Protein-NP) to simplify finding
of protein-protein interaction phrases. Patterns
of Protein-NPs in conjunction with selected verb
groups are annotated as final result.

This cascaded approach to NER has been incor-
porated into EBIMed, a system for mining bio-
medical literature.
EBIMed is a service that combines document
retrieval with co-occurrence-based summariza-
tion of Medline abstracts. Upon a keyword
query, EBIMed retrieves abstracts from EMBL-
EBI’s installation of Medline and filters for bio-
medical terminology. The final result is organ-
ised in a view displaying pairs of concepts. Each
pair co-occurs in at least one sentence in the re-
trieved abstracts. The findings (e.g.
UniProt/Swiss-Prot proteins, GO annotations,
drugs and species) are listed in conjunction with
the UniProt/Swiss-Prot protein that appears in
the same biological context. All terms, retrieved
abstracts and extracted sentences are automatic-
ally linked to contextual information, e.g. entries
in biomedical databases.
The annotation modules are also available via
HTTP request that allows for specification of
which modules to run (cf. Whatizit11). Note that
with suitable pre-processing to insert the
&lt;text&gt; tags, even well formed HTML can be
processed.

5 Lessons Learnt so far
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954769230769">
Our text mining solution EBIMed successfully
applies multi-dimensional markup in a pipeline
of text processing modules to facilitate online re-
trieval and mining of the biomedical literature.
The final goal is semantic annotation of biomed-
ical terms with UID, and – in the next step –
shallow parsing based text processing for rela-
tionship identification. The following lessons
have been learnt during design, implementation
and use of our system.
The end-users expect to see the original docu-
ment at all times and therefore we have to rely on
proper formatting of the original and the pro-
cessed text. Consequently, when adding semant-
ic information, all other meta-information must
be preserved to allow for proper rendering as
similar as possible to the original document.
Therefore, our approach does not remove any
pre-existing annotations supplied by the publish-
er, i.e. the original document could be recovered
by removing all introduced markup.
All modules only process sections of the docu-
ment containing the natural language text, which
improves modularisation. The document struc-
ture is irrelevant to single modules and facilitates
reading and writing to the input and output

stream, respectively, without taking notice of the
beginning and/or the end of a single document.
All information exchanged between modules is
contained in the data stream. This facilitates run-
ning all the modules in a given pipeline in paral-
lel, after an initial start-up. Even more, the mod-
ules can be distributed on separate machines with
no implementation overheads for the communic-
ation over the network. Adding more modules
with their own processors does not significantly
impair overall runtime behaviour for large data-
sets and leads to fast text processing throughput
combined with a reasonable — albeit not yet per-
fect — quality, which allows for new and prac-
tically useful text mining solutions such as
EBIMed.
Modularisation of the text processing tasks
leads to improved scalability and maintainability
inherent to all modular software solutions. In the
case of the presented solution, the modular ap-
proach allows for a selection of the setup and or-
dering of the modules, leading to a flexible soft-
ware design, which can be adapted to different
types of documents and which allows for an (in-
cremental) replacement of methods to improve
the quality of the output. This can also facilitate
improved interoperability of XML-based NLP
tools.
Semantic annotation of named entities and
terms blends effectively with logical markup,
simply because there is no overlap between doc-
ument structure and named entities and terms.
On the other hand, some physical markup (such
as &lt;i&gt; in the BMC corpus) is in some documents
used to highlight names or terms of a semantic
type, e.g. gene names. With consistent semantic
markup, this kind of physical tags could be aban-
doned to be replaced by external style informa-
tion. However, some semantic annotations still
must be combined with physical markup as in the
term B-sup that initially was annotated by a pub-
lisher as &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;-sup and that now (after
NER) would be marked as
&lt;z:uniprot&gt;&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;-sup&lt;/z:uniprot&gt;.
Matching of names of a semantic type, e.g.
protein/gene, is done on a “longest of the left-
most” basis and prioritization of semantic types
is enforced by the order of the term identification
modules. Both choices lead to the result that
overlapping annotations are preempted and that
annotations automatically endorse a link to a
unique identifier, unless there are ambiguity on
the level of biomedical resource.. This type of
ambiguity is not resolved in our text processing
solution. Instead, for a given biomedical term,
links to all entries referring to this term in the
same database are kept.

<bodyText confidence="0.99948545">
One approach to the disambiguation of Amb2
(multiple resources) and Amb3 (common Eng-
lish words) ambiguities would be to integrate all
terms into one massive dictionary, identify the
strings in the text and then disambiguate between
n semantic types. This would require the disam-
biguation module be trained to distinguish all se-
mantic types. If a new type is added, the disam-
biguation module would need to be retrained,
which limits the possibilities for expansion and
tailoring of text mining solutions.
Open Problems: We consider two categories of
open problems: NLP-based and XML-based
problems.
Bio NLP-based problems include challenges
in recognition and disambiguation of biomedical
names in text. One of the main issues in our ap-
proach is annotation of compound and nested
terms. The presented methodology can lead to
the following annotations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980450181818182">
1. the head noun belongs to the same semantic
type, but is not part of the protein name (as
represented in the terminological resource):
&lt;z:uniprot&gt;Wnt-2&lt;/z:uniprot&gt; protein
2. the head noun belongs to a different semantic
type not covered by any of the available ter-
minological resources:
&lt;z:uniprot&gt;WNT8B&lt;/z:uniprot&gt; mRNA
3. a compound term consists of terms from dif-
ferent semantic types, but its semantic type is
not known:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97371048">
&lt;z:uniprot fb=”0” ids=”...”&gt;beta-
catenin&lt;/z:uniprot&gt; &lt;z:go ids=”...”
onto= ”...”&gt;binding &lt;/z:go&gt; domain
Therefore, an important open problem is the
annotation of nested terms where an entity name
is part of a larger term that may or may not be in
one of the dictionaries. Once the inner term is
marked up with inline annotation, simple string
pattern matching (utilised in our approach) can-
not be used easily to find the outer, because the
XML structure is in the way. A more effective
solution could be a combination of inline with
stand-off annotation.
Further, in a more complex case such as in
htr-wnt-&lt;uniprot&gt;A protein&lt;/uniprot&gt;
neither wnt nor htr refer to a single protein but
to a protein family, and whereas A protein is
a known protein, this is not the case for wnt-A.
The most obvious annotation &lt;uniprot&gt;htr-
wnt-A protein&lt;/uniprot&gt; cannot be re-
solved by the terminology from the
UniProt/Swiss-Prot database, as it simply does
not exist in the database.
More work is also needed on disambiguation
of terms that correspond to common English
words.
Annotation (i.e. XML)-based problems mainly
relate to an open question whether different tag
names should be used for various semantic types,
or semantic types should be represented via at-
tributes of a generalised named entity or term
tag. In EBIMed, specific tags are used to denote
specific semantic types. A similar challenge is
how to treat and make use of entities such as in-
line references, citations and formulas (typically
annotated in journals), which are commonly ig-
nored by NLP modules.
The most important issue, however, is how to
represent still unresolved ambiguities, so that an-
notations might be modified at a later stage, e.g.
when POS information or even the full parse tree
is available. This also includes the issues on kind
of information that should be made available for
later processing. For example, as (compound)
term identification is done before POS tagging,
an open question is whether POS information
should be assigned to individual components of a
compound term (in addition to the term itself),
since this information could be used to complete
NER or adjust the results in a later stage.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977111111111">
In this paper, we have described a pipeline of
XML-based modules for identification and dis-
ambiguation of several semantic types of bio-
medical named entities. The pipeline processes
and semantically enriches documents by adding,
changing or removing annotations. More pre-
cisely, the documents are augmented with UIDs
referring to referential databases. In the course
of the processing, the number of annotated NEs
increases and the quality of the annotation im-
proves. Thus, one of the main issues is to repres-
ent still unresolved ambiguities consistently, so
that the following modules can perform both
identification and disambiguation of new se-
mantic types. As subsequent modules try to add
new semantic annotations, prioritization of se-
mantic types is enforced by the order of the term
identification modules.
We have shown that such approach can be em-
ployed in a real-world, online information min-
ing system EBIMed. The end-users expect to
view the original layout of the documents at all
times, and thus the solution needs to provide an
efficient multidimensional markup that preserves
and combines existing markup (from publishers)
with semantic NLP-derived tags. Since, in the
biomedical domain, it is essential to provide

links from term and named-entity occurrences to
referential databases, EBIMed provides identific-
ation and disambiguation of such entities and in-
tegrates text with other knowledge sources.
The existing solution to annotate only longest
non-overlapped entities is useful for real world
use scenarios, but we also need ways to improve
annotations by representing nested and over-
lapped terms.

<abstract confidence="0.997641111111111">Publishers of biomedical journals increasingly use XML as the underlying document format. We present a modular text-processing pipeline that inserts XML markup into such documents in every processing step, leading to multi-dimensional markup. The markup introduced is used to identify and disambiguate named entities of several semantic types (protein/gene, Gene Ontology terms, drugs and species) and to communicate data from one module to the next. Each module independently adds, changes or removes markup, which allows for modularization and a flexible setup of the processing pipeline. We also describe how the cascaded approach is embedded in a large-scale XML-based application (EBIMed) used for on-line access to biomedical literature. We discuss the lessons learnt so far, as well as the open problems that need to be resolved. In particular, we argue that the pragmatic and tailored solutions allow for reduction in the need for overlapping annotations — although not completely without cost.</abstract>

(Amb3) A name is not only used as a biomedical term but also as part of common English (in contrast to the biomedical terminology), e.g. ‘who’ and ‘how’, which are used as protein names. In some cases (i.e. Amb2), broader classification can help to disambiguate between different entries (e.g. differentiate between ‘CAT’ as a protein, animal or medical device). However, it is ineffective in situations where names can be mapped to several different entries in the same data source. In such situations, disambiguation on the resource level is needed (see, for example, (Liu et al., 2002) for disambiguation of terms associated with several entries in the UMLS Metathesaurus).

As for proteins, the semantic type is signified by the element name and a unique ID referencing the source database is added as an attribute. Disambiguation for these names and terms is, however, not yet available. Finding GO ontology terms in text can be difficult, as these names are typically “descriptions” rather than real terms (e.g. GO:0016886, ligase activity, forming phosporic ester bonds), and therefore are not likely to appear in text frequently (McCray et al., 2002; Verspoor et al., 2003; Nenadic et al., 2004). Figure 3 shows an example of a sentence annotated for semantic types and POS information using the pipeline from the Figure 1.

In many solutions, the three steps in biomedical NER (namely, recognition, categorisation and mapping to databases) are merged within one module. For example, using an existing terminological database for recognition of NEs, effectively leads to complete term identification (in cases where there are no ambiguities). Some researchers, however, have stressed the advantages of tackling each step as a separate task, pointing at different sources and methods needed to accomplish each of the subtasks (Torii et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003). Also, in the case of modularisation, it is easier to integrate different solutions for each specific problem. However, it has been suggested that whether a clear separation into single steps would improve term identification is an open issue (Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004). In this paper we discuss a cascaded, modular approach to biomedical NER. 3 Biomedical NER based on XML annotation: Modules in a pipeline In this Section we present a modular approach to identification, disambiguation and annotation of 8 UniProt, http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/, (Bairoch et al., 2005); Swiss</context>

As for proteins, the semantic type is signified by the element name and a unique ID referencing the source database is added as an attribute. Disambiguation for these names and terms is, however, not yet available. Finding GO ontology terms in text can be difficult, as these names are typically “descriptions” rather than real terms (e.g. GO:0016886, ligase activity, forming phosporic ester bonds), and therefore are not likely to appear in text frequently (McCray et al., 2002; Verspoor et al., 2003; Nenadic et al., 2004). Figure 3 shows an example of a sentence annotated for semantic types and POS information using the pipeline from the Figure 1. Note that POS tags are inside the type tags although type annotation has been performed prior to the POS tagging. 3.6 Other modules in the pipeline The modular text processing pipeline of EBIMed is currently being extended to include other modules. The part-of-speech tagger (POS-tagger) is a separate module and combines tokenization and POS annotation. It leaves previously annotated entities as single tokens, even for multi-word terms, and assi</context>

Rather, the links to all entries in the same database are maintained. Amb2 and Amb3 are partially resolved for protein/gene names as explained below (steps M-4 and M-5). Note that Amb2 is resolved on “first-come first-serve” basis, meaning that an annotation introduced by one module is not overwritten by a subsequent module. Many protein names are indeed or at least look like abbreviations. It has been proved that ambiguities of abbreviations and acronyms found in Medline abstracts can be automatically resolved with high accuracy (Yu et al., 2002; Schwartz and Hearst, 2003; Gaudan et al., 2005). &lt;SENT sid=”2” pm=”.”&gt; Aberrant Wnt signaling, which results from mutations of either &lt;z:uniprot fb=”0” ids=”P26233,P35222,P35223, P35224,Q02248, Q9WU82”&gt;betacatenin&lt;/z:uniprot&gt; or adenomatous polyposis coli (&lt;z:uniprot fb=”28” ids=”P25054”&gt;APC &lt;/z:uniprot&gt;), renders &lt;z:uniprot fb=”0” ids= ”P26233,P35222, P35223, P35224,Q02248, Q9WU82”&gt; betacatenin&lt;/z:uniprot&gt; resistant to degradation, and has been associated with multiple types of human cancers &lt;/SENT&gt; Figure 2.
