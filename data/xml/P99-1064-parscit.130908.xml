The distinction between achievements and
accomplishments is known to be an
empirically important but subtle one. It is
argued here to depend on the atomicity
(rather than punctuality) of events, and to be
strongly related to incrementality (i.e., to
event-object mapping functions). A
computational treatment of incrementality
and atomicity is discussed in the paper, and
a number of related empirical problems
considered, notably lexical polysemy in verb
â€” argument relationships.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860133333333">
Ever since Vendler (1957) introduced it, the so-
called punctuality of achievements has been the
object of many theoretical contests. After having
demonstrated that punctuality actually breaks up
into two, distinct notions, namely non-durativity
and atomicity, I will argue here for a
compositional semantic account of the latter. I
will show that (non-)atomicity interacts closely
with the notion of incrementality, as formulated
in Dowty (1991), and that this property of verbs
should be lexically encoded, although it is
subject both to semantics and pragmatics-driven
variations. I will finally discuss the formal
specifications an NLP system could use to make
predictions about atomicity and incrementality.

1. On Vendler&apos;s so-called achievements
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999248714285714">
Vendler (1957) defined achievements and
accomplishments as respectively punctual and
durative. He based his claims on two main tests,
noting that at &lt;time expression&gt; adverbials
combine with achievements but not
accomplishments, whereas finish combines with
accomplishments but not achievements:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996386166666667">
(la) At what time did you reach the top? At
noon sharp.
(lb) At what moment did you spot the plane?
At 10:53 A.M.
(2a) *John finished leaving.
(2b) John finished drawing the circle.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996762">
Dowty (1986) and Moens and Steedman (1988)
decisively questioned the coherence of the class
of achievement verbs, arguing that not all of
them are non-durative. As noted above, Vendler
identifies punctual events through the
conjunction of the (positive) at and (negative)
finish tests. However, they do not always yield
comparable results:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.94131275">
(3a) Karpov beat Kasparov at 10.00 P.M.
(3b) *The Allies beat Germany at 10.00 P.M.
(4a) *Karpov finished beating Kasparov
(4b) The Allies finished beating Germany.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998725666666667">
The at test fails to characterize (3b) as an
achievement because it is durative, whereas (3a)
passes this very test because it is non-durative.
On the contrary, the finish test in (4) yields an
identical result for the beating of a chess player
and that of a whole nation. It appears thus that
the finish test does not indicate non-durativity,
contrary to the at test, which refuses durative
events, and that telic events such as (3b) fall
outside Vendler&apos;s classification, since they fail
both the finish test (unlike accomplishments)
AND the at test (unlike achievements). Since it
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997144">
497
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932">
is desirable that achievements should include
events such as (3b), durativity should not be
considered as a necessary property of
achievements. The salient common point
between (3a) and (3b) is that both events lack
proper subparts, i.e., are atomic. Atomicity
should thus be regarded as the defining property
of achievements ; it can be tested with finish.

2. Atomicity as a semantic issue
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999346">
Many authors, including Verkuyl (1993) and
Jackendoff (1996), have denied atomicity any
semantic content, and have argued that it is a
pragmatic category. I do not intend to claim here
that atomicity is not subject to pragmatic
constraints. The following examples identify one
such constraint, i.e., the relative size of
arguments of verbs of consumption:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.675570571428571">
(5a) ??John finished eating the raspberry.
(5b) The bird finished eating the raspberry.
(5a) suggests that raspberries are so small with
respect to a human &apos;eater&apos; that eat denotes an
atomic event. But the same does not hold true of
birds (cf. (5b)). No attention will be paid to this
kind of pragmatic constraint in this paper.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.962093">
Yet I will demonstrate here that atomicity does
possess a semantic content, and that therefore it
can be regarded as an aspectual category.
Consider the following examples&apos;:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98726775">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935777777778">
The plural NPs the soldiers and the doors
possess proper subparts, along which the
crossing and slamming events in (6b) and (7b)
are measured, making those events non-atomic
(there are several distinct subevents of one door
being slammed, and of one soldier crossing the
border) ; compare with the atomic (6a) and (7a),
where those very NPs are singular. The variation
in noun quantification being a semantic one,

(1979), but were discussed in terms of durativity, and

<bodyText confidence="0.767326">
atomicity should clearly receive some form of
semantic content. Moreover, it should be noted
that atomic events are not compatible with the
progressive perfect, whereas non-atomic ones
freely combine with it2 :

3. Towards a semantic account: (non-)
atomicity and incrementality
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998475">
The above data suggests an interesting solution
to this puzzle: atomicity seems to be related to
the notion of incrementality, as formulated in
Dowty (1991) (see also graduality in Krifka
1992). To my knowledge, the concept of
incrementality (originally proposed to account
for the telicity of events) has never been
discussed in the light of that of atomicity,
although this is an obvious thing to do, both
concepts being about the present or absence of
subevents in the internal structure of events. I
will undertake to bridge this gap here.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9325675">
3.1 Incrementality and delimiting
arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991775">
Dowty defines incrementality as a property of
verbs whose development can be measured
along the inner structure of one of their
arguments (which he calls incremental theme) :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.606068">

3 Caudal (1998) discusses at length related examples
involving collection-referring nouns (e.g., orchestra
or regiment), and shows that they behave similarly,
cf. The regiment finished crossing the border.

corresponding event (a fact which Dowty (1991)
and ICrifka (1992) refers to as event-object
homomorphism). Dowty (1991) rejects
ostensibly the possibility to treat as incremental
themes the patient arguments of so-called
punctual (i.e., achievement) verbs, such as slam
open. According to him, incremental themes
should be able to undergo a gradual change of
state&apos;. Unfortunately, Dowty does not consider
examples such as (7b), which exhibit an
incremental behaviour although they include this
very kind of patient argument. I will therefore
reject Dowty&apos;s objection, and regard (7b) as
incremental.
It follows naturally from the above definition
that incrementality entails non-atomicity : it
implies that a situation&apos;s development possesses
proper subparts, and therefore that it is non-
atomic. But does non-atomicity entail
incrementality, conversely? I.e., are those two
notions equivalent? If not, how should they be
connected? In order to answer those questions
in the following sections, I will make use of a
rough feature-based notation: [+/-ATM] will
express atomicity/non-atomicity, and [-1-/-INC]
incrementality/non-incrementality.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999922">
3.2 Non-atomicity with incrementality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999395363636364">
I will call delimiting arguments the arguments of
a verb serving as `measures&apos; (or `odometers&apos;) for
the corresponding event (e.g. the internal
arguments of drink or slam open). It should be
noted that this term is broader than that of
incremental theme, since it includes e.g., patient
arguments of so-called punctual verbs, which
Dowty refused to regard as incremental themes.
For the sake of simplicity, I will focus in this
paper exclusively on internal delimiting
arguments :

(10) shows that eat can be [-ATM],[+INC] both
with a definite singular and plural delimiting
argument, whereas (11) shows that throw can be
[-ATM],[+INC] only with a definite plural
delimiting argument. The development of eating
his apple is measured in (10a) along the quantity
of apple remaining to eat, whereas that of
throwing his stones in (11b) is measured along
the successive individual stones being thrown
away. I will extend the notion of incrementality
to this latter kind of event-object mapping.
Under this view, incrementality arises from
delimiting arguments, and not only fom
incremental themes. However, I will distinguish
two types of incrementality, thereby preserving a
distinction between Dowty&apos;s incrementality and
the extension I proposed. I will call
m-incrementality (for quantity of matter-
incrementality) the type of incrementality
exhibited by (10a) and i-incrementality (for
individual-incrementality) that exhibited by
(11b). At least two classes of verbs can be
distinguished in this respect: verbs like eat are
capable of m-incrementality, i.e., incrementality
with individual-referring delimiting arguments
(they have an incremental themes in the sense of
Dowty), whereas verbs like throw are only
capable of i-incrementality, i.e., incrementality
with collection-referring delimiting arguments
(they lack an incremental theme in the sense of
Dowty). Of course, non-atomicity can follow
from either i or m-incrementality.
Another type of incremental non-atomic events
can be found in path-movement verbs:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999388">
The development of the walking event can be
measured along the explicit path argument the
Appalachian trail in (12). It is therefore
[-ATM],[+INC]. White (1994) proposed a
generalized path-based incremental theme role
to account for the semantic behaviour of both
patient and path delimiting arguments, fairly
akin to the present one, since it crucially relies
on a similar individual / quantity of matter
distinction. One could conclude at this point that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995986">
499
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991166666667">
the present account of incrementality is
sufficient to predict (non-)atomicity, and that
non-atomicity and incrementality are equivalent
notions. If that is right, then non-incremental
events should be non-atomic. However, I will
show in 3.3 that it is not the case.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999076">
3.3 Non-atomicity without incrementality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998632">
Some non-atomic events lack a delimiting
argument, so that the type of non-atomicity
involved seems unrelated to incrementality :

<bodyText confidence="0.999145766666667">
Contrary to (10) and (11b) , neither (13), (14)
nor (15) are (necessarily) measured along the
subparts of their patient arguments. (13) and
(14) are rather measured along the state of the
latter, which vary as time passes. In this sense,
his pudding and the chicken do not behave like
delimiting arguments, and those non-atomic
situations are non-incremental ([-ATM],{-INC]).
Some sort of non-argumental odometer seems to
be required. In the case of (13) and (14), digest
and cook receive a scalar result state, i.e., one
that varies as time passes: John&apos;s chicken
becomes (as a whole) closer to being (finally)
cooked as time passes in (14), and John&apos;s
pudding gradually turns (as a whole, and not bit
by bit) into nutriments inside his stomach in (13)
(see Caudal (1999a/b) for a treatment of such
data). I will refer to this kind of incremental-like
reading as scalarity. If one considers (15), things
are somewhat different, as there exists some sort
of predetermined series of stages through which
one should pass in order to register at the
university: John&apos;s son is closer and closer to
being registered at the university as his father
goes through them. I will refer to this kind of
data as gradual scenarios.
I will turn now to the computational treatment of
incremental non-atomic events (section 4),
before suggesting some ways of accounting for
non-incremental non-atomic ones (section 5).

<bodyText confidence="0.999940416666667">
A formal and computational treatment of
incremental non-atomic events will be
formulated here, relying on model-theoretic
logics and on the Generative Lexicon framework
(GL henceforth; see Pustejovsky (1995) for an
introduction). I will first discuss a few
theoretical notions related to the internal
structure of objects and events, in order to
formalize m and i-incrementality. I will leave
aside the treatment of incremental path-
arguments, referring the interested reader to
White (1994).

4.1 Internal structure of objects and
events : Link&apos;s part-of operators
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827">
Following Link (1983), I will oppose individuals
(i.e., the denotata of nouns referring to
individual entities) and collections (i.e., the
denotata of definite plural NPs, collectives, etc. ;
see Caudal (1998a)). Let A be the domain of
entities (events or objects), structured as a semi-
lattice. Let individual_part_of be a partial order
relation on individual entities (henceforth i-part
or 5.4), connecting an individual to the collection
it belongs to. Let U1 be the join operation on
individuals and collections, y a collection and x
an individual, such that x is an i-part of y. The
definition of the meronymic operator 5.; was
formulated by Link as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.939098">
(16) Vx,y [x y --&gt; x LI; y = y]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999658066666667">
Following again G. Link, I will define similarly
a partial order relation on non-individual parts,
m-part (or which connects an individual
and its non-individual parts (e.g. a slab of stone
to a rock). All those operators will apply both to
events and objects in the model (events being
reified). As a consequence, collection-referring
NPs as well as i-incremental events are endowed
with i-parts, whereas individual-referring NPs
and m-incremental events possess m-parts.
I will argue that incrementality depends both on
lexical information and structural composition.
Whether events will receive (or not) an
incremental reading is determined at the
structural level, depending on the interaction of

a verb with its delimiting arguments (modulo

lexical component of this compositional
procedure.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9848095">
4.2 Encoding incrementality within the
Generative Lexicon framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998414434782609">
I will propose here to encode lexically whether
verbs are capable of m-incrementality or
i-incrementality. It should be noted that although
the ability to exhibit m-incrementality seems to
be a constant lexical property, any potentially
incremental verb can receive an i-incremental
reading (but recall that not all verbs can be read
incrementally). In the spirit of Krifka&apos; s object-
event mapping functions (see Krifka 1992), I
will assume an i-inc aspectual semantic role
function that relates the i-parts of an argument
to the development of an event (causing it to
become i-incremental with an appropriate
delimiting argument), and a m-inc function that
relates the m-parts of an argument to the
development of an event (causing it to become
m-incremental with an appropriate delimiting
argument). The following event/object mapping
predicate MAP-I (applying only to i-inc
aspectual roles) can be derived from Krifka&apos;s
MAP-0/E (mapping to objects/events)
predicates (see Krifka 1992:39) by replacing his
standard partial order operator with 5; :
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989764333333333">
(17) MAP-I:
VR[MAP-I(R) MAP-E, (R) A MAP-01 (R)]

3e&apos; [e&apos; e A R(e&apos;,x&apos;)] 1]
VR[MAP-01 (R) &lt;4 Ve,e&apos;,x [R(e,x) A e&apos;51 e
3x&apos; [ A R(e&apos;,x&apos;)] ]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996750866666667">
A similar formulation can be given for
m-incrementality ; replace with 5m in (17).
Thus, by combining Link&apos;s part-of operators
with ICrifka&apos;s event-object mapping functions,
atomicity construal functions can be formulated.
Finally, GL will provide us with the proper
computational lexical machinery in which to
insert those functions: I will propose to encode
those aspectual roles within the argument
structure (ARGSTR) feature in GL, by making
them bear directly on the relevant argument
position. The following entries for eat and throw
illustrate such an encoding for internal
arguments (again, external arguments are left
aside for the sake of simplicity) :
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998658545454545">

m/i-inc(x,e) indicates that the internal
structures of subevent e and argument x are
related by an homorphic mapping. If x possesses
proper subparts, then e will be incremental ; the
whole point remains that incrementality is
lexically licensed but structurally construed. The
Binary_ItStage subevent refers to the complex
result state (Result Stage ; cf. Caudal 1999b)
attached to a transition such as eat. Its binary
structure expresses a change-of-state. I will now
consider some difficulties related to lexical

The French verb produire yields an
i-incremental reading in (18a), vs. a
m-incremental reading in (18b). Arguably,
produire means &apos;to cause to come into
existence&apos;, and therefore makes use of the
content of the AGENTIVE qualia role (i.e., the
qualia role indicating how a type is brought into
existence) of its internal argument to determine
the corresponding &apos;creation&apos; event. The
AGENTIVE roles of bruit and article can be
represented as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.998868375">
involving events specified in the AGENTIVE of
bruit and article, produire interacts differently
with its internal argument, and receives different
event structures. The emit_sound(e,y,x) event
in (19) comes along an i-inc function mapping
the internal argument x onto e, while the
write(e,y,x) event in (20) comes along an
m-inc function mapping x onto e. In fact, the
whole event structure of those AGENTIVE roles
together with their incrementality functions
override those lexically specified by default for
produire.
Another limit of GL until recent work (cf. Asher
and Pustejovsky 1999) was its inability to
construe more versatile qualia role information.

chambre in (22a), and no incremental reading in
(22b), so that it seems to be properly neither
i-incremental nor m-incremental. The way out of
this puzzle is the following: ranger is lexically
encoded as capable of i-incrementality but not of
m-incrementality, and the aspectual polysemy of
ranger sa chambre originates in the polysemy of
chambre. Although there is no question that
chambre normally refers to an individual, its
meaning is coerced into a collective one in
(22a). More precisely, chambre is coerced from
an individual real estate sense
(immovable_phys_obj) to a collection sense
involving the individual objects possibly
enclosed within a room (movable_phys_obj),
since only the latter is compatible with ranger.
One way of accounting for such coercions
within GL would be to associate with the
CONST qualia role of chambre such a collection
of instances of the movable_phys_obj type, the
CONST role describing the meronymic
constitution of a type.

In fact, the ability to trigger this very kind of
coercion seems to be a general property of verbs
addressing their arguments through their
FORMAL role (i.e., requiring natural types â€”
centrally defined through their CONST and
FORMAL â€” and not functional types â€” centrally
defined through their AGENTIVE and TELIC ;
see Pustejovsky 1999). Such verbs are usually
able to access their arguments&apos; semantics as
individuals through their FORMAL role, and as
collections of individuals through their CONST
role, if the FORMAL individual does not meet
the selectional restrictions imposed by the verb,
or other semantic constraints. See Caudal (1998)
for detailed evidence of this, and for a tentative
solution within GL to the problems raised by the
polysemy of collective nouns (e.g., regiment,
police and forest), which exhibit a similar
behaviour, i.e., can either refer to individuals or
to collections. Finally, it should be noted that
homeomeronymic nouns (i.e., whose parts and
whole refer to the same lexical type, e.g. estate
or property seen as land surfaces, or quantity of
matter nouns, such as gold or milk; see Winston
et al. (1987)) offer other interesting properties
w.r.t. to incrementality/atomicity. I will not
discuss them here for want of space.
To put it in a nutshell, even prima facie
individual-referring nouns such as chambre can
behave like collection-referring ones under
certain circumstances, making i-incremental
readings of normally atomic events possible. Let
us move now to some concluding remarks about
non-incremental non-atomic events.

5. On the formal treatment of non-
incremental non-atomic events
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959714285715">
I have shown above that the notion of
incrementality fell short of explaining the non-
atomicity of (13), (14), and (15). I will suggest
here a solution based on an extended conception
of result states.
The non-incremental, non-atomic events
discussed in 3.3 seem to fall into at least two
distinct subclasses : scalar events (cf. (13)/(14))
vs. &amp;quot;gradual scenario&amp;quot; events (cf. (15)). I will
focus on the former class, the latter class
originating clearly in a pragmatic phenomenon6.
It should be noted that many resultative
constructions (e.g., pound the metal flat; see
Levin and Rappaport 1995) also receive scalar
readings, making the phenomenon a fairly
widespread one.
It is a fact that the notions of affectedness and
incrementality / event-object mapping do not
apply to scalar events. Affectedness indicates
that an argument undergoes an incremental (cf.
eat) or a definite change of state (cf. throw), and
not a gradual but total one, as in the case of
scalar verbs (their delimiting arguments are
gradually changing as a whole, and not bit by
bit). (14) is telic and non-atomic because the
chicken goes through successive states of
`cookedness&apos; (i.e., result states) before reaching
a final state, and not because of some event-
object mapping function in the spirit of Krifka
(1992). Therefore, the telicity of scalar events
can only be explained by reference to this scalar
change of state, which entails itself a scalar
result state. Encoding a richer information about
result states in the lexical entries of such verbs,
as proposed in Caudal (1999a/b), would allow us
to account elegantly for this kind of non-atomic,
non-incremental, telic readings of events.
This new conception of result states provide us
with a unified account7 of (non)-atomicity,
incrementality and telicity â€” a result which
generalized paths cannot achieve for reasons
exposed above, and others not discussed here.
Indeed, even the non-incremental, non-atomic
events studied in 3.3 (except (15), but then again
this is a pragmatic issue) can also be accounted
for in this manner, and path-argument verbs can
also be analysed in terms of result states if
changes of location undergone by arguments are
treated as changes-of-state.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.79690925">
6 Note that contrary to scalar events and incremental
events, &amp;quot;gradual scenarios&amp;quot; do not combine with the
progressive perfect, cf. *John has been registering his
son at the university. This fact suggests that they
should be set apart from other non-atomic events, and
possibly receive subevents of a different kind.

RStages are introduced.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999883125">
It has been demonstrated in this paper that the
so-called punctuality of achievements should be
reduced to the notion of atomicity. Formal
means to calculate it within an NLP system have
been discussed; see White (1994) for a
computational implementation of related
interest, in a similar spirit. The machinery
exposed above can be used to predict whether an
event should be considered as an
accomplishment (non-atomic event; possesses
subevents) or an achievement (atomic event;
lacks any subevent).
The above developments revealed that
(non-)atomicity is at least partly amenable to a
compositional semantic procedure, and does not
fall altogether under the scope of pragmatics. It
has been shown to be directly related to
incrementality in many cases, though not in all
cases. In order to construe incremental non-
atomic events, I proposed to encode
m-incrementality vs. i-incrementality in the
lexicon, before discussing the accessibility of the
internal structure of delimiting argument NPs ; I
suggested a solution to the problems raised by
the polysemous internal structure of certain
nouns. Finally, a tentative result-state based
account of non-incremental non-atomic events
has been proposed. I even claimed that it can
explain all types of non-atomicity and even
incrementality in a unified way, and therefore
might surpass all the existing accounts of event
structure.

I will undertake to bridge this gap here. 3.1 Incrementality and delimiting arguments Dowty defines incrementality as a property of verbs whose development can be measured along the inner structure of one of their arguments (which he calls incremental theme) : (9) John drank a glass of beer. In (9), the development of the drinking event can be measured along the subparts of the glass of beer.

Let A be the domain of entities (events or objects), structured as a semilattice. Let individual_part_of be a partial order relation on individual entities (henceforth i-part or 5.4), connecting an individual to the collection it belongs to. Let U1 be the join operation on individuals and collections, y a collection and x an individual, such that x is an i-part of y. The definition of the meronymic operator 5.; was formulated by Link as follows: (16) Vx,y [x y --&gt; x LI; y = y] Following again G.

Introduction Ever since Vendler (1957) introduced it, the socalled punctuality of achievements has been the object of many theoretical contests. After having demonstrated that punctuality actually breaks up into two, distinct notions, namely non-durativity and atomicity, I will argue here for a compositional semantic account of the latter. I will show that (non-)atomicity interacts closely with the notion of incrementality, as formulated in Dowty (1991), and that this property of verbs should be lexically encoded, although it is subject both to semantics and pragmatics-driven variations. I will finally discuss the formal specifications an NLP system could use to make predictions about atomicity and incrementality. 1.

Towards a semantic account: (non-) atomicity and incrementality The above data suggests an interesting solution to this puzzle: atomicity seems to be related to the notion of incrementality, as formulated in Dowty (1991) (see also graduality in Krifka 1992). To my knowledge, the concept of incrementality (originally proposed to account for the telicity of events) has never been discussed in the light of that of atomicity, although this is an obvious thing to do, both concepts being about the present or absence of subevents in the internal structure of events.

Dowty (1991) rejects ostensibly the possibility to treat as incremental themes the patient arguments of so-called punctual (i.e., achievement) verbs, such as slam open. According to him, incremental themes should be able to undergo a gradual change of state&apos;. Unfortunately, Dowty does not consider examples such as (7b), which exhibit an incremental behaviour although they include this very kind of patient argument. I will therefore reject Dowty&apos;s objection, and regard (7b) as incremental.

It should be noted that this term is broader than that of incremental theme, since it includes e.g., patient arguments of so-called punctual verbs, which Dowty refused to regard as incremental themes. For the sake of simplicity, I will focus in this paper exclusively on internal delimiting arguments : (10a) John finished eating his apple. (10b) John finished eating his apples. (11 a) *John finished throwing his stone. (1 lb) John finished throwing his stones. 4 Cf. Dowty (1991:568) : Many traditional Themes.. .are not Incremental Themes.

I will now describe the lexical component of this compositional procedure. 4.2 Encoding incrementality within the Generative Lexicon framework I will propose here to encode lexically whether verbs are capable of m-incrementality or i-incrementality. It should be noted that although the ability to exhibit m-incrementality seems to be a constant lexical property, any potentially incremental verb can receive an i-incremental reading (but recall that not all verbs can be read incrementally). In the spirit of Krifka&apos; s objectevent mapping functions (see Krifka 1992), I will assume an i-inc aspectual semantic role function that relates the i-parts of an argument to the development of an event (causing it to become i-incremental with an appropriate delimiting argument), and a m-inc function that relates the m-parts of an argument to the development of an event (causing it to become m-incremental with an appropriate delimiting argument). The following event/object mapping predicate MAP-I (applying only to i-inc aspectual roles) can be derived from Krifka&apos;s MAP-0/E (mapping to objects/events) predicates (see Krifka 1992:39) by replacing his standard partial </context>

Affectedness indicates that an argument undergoes an incremental (cf. eat) or a definite change of state (cf. throw), and not a gradual but total one, as in the case of scalar verbs (their delimiting arguments are gradually changing as a whole, and not bit by bit). (14) is telic and non-atomic because the chicken goes through successive states of `cookedness&apos; (i.e., result states) before reaching a final state, and not because of some eventobject mapping function in the spirit of Krifka (1992). Therefore, the telicity of scalar events can only be explained by reference to this scalar change of state, which entails itself a scalar result state. Encoding a richer information about result states in the lexical entries of such verbs, as proposed in Caudal (1999a/b), would allow us to account elegantly for this kind of non-atomic, non-incremental, telic readings of events. This new conception of result states provide us with a unified account7 of (non)-atomicity, incrementality and telicity â€” a result which generalized paths cannot achieve for reasons exposed above, and others not discu</context>

See Caudal (1998) for detailed evidence of this, and for a tentative solution within GL to the problems raised by the polysemy of collective nouns (e.g., regiment, police and forest), which exhibit a similar behaviour, i.e., can either refer to individuals or to collections. Finally, it should be noted that homeomeronymic nouns (i.e., whose parts and whole refer to the same lexical type, e.g. estate or property seen as land surfaces, or quantity of matter nouns, such as gold or milk; see Winston et al. (1987)) offer other interesting properties w.r.t. to incrementality/atomicity. I will not discuss them here for want of space. To put it in a nutshell, even prima facie individual-referring nouns such as chambre can behave like collection-referring ones under certain circumstances, making i-incremental readings of normally atomic events possible. Let us move now to some concluding remarks about non-incremental non-atomic events. 5. On the formal treatment of nonincremental non-atomic events I have shown above that the notion of incrementality fell short of explaining the nonatomicity of (13), (14), </context>

Of course, non-atomicity can follow from either i or m-incrementality. Another type of incremental non-atomic events can be found in path-movement verbs: (12) Mary walked the Appalachian trail. (Tenny 1994) The development of the walking event can be measured along the explicit path argument the Appalachian trail in (12). It is therefore [-ATM],[+INC]. White (1994) proposed a generalized path-based incremental theme role to account for the semantic behaviour of both patient and path delimiting arguments, fairly akin to the present one, since it crucially relies on a similar individual / quantity of matter distinction. One could conclude at this point that 499 the present account of incrementality is sufficient to predict (non-)atomicity, and that non-atomicity and incrementality are equivalent notions. If that is right, then non-incremental events should be non-atomic. However, I will show in 3.3 that it is not the case. 3.3 Non-atomicity without increm</context>

A formal, computational treatment of incremental non-atomic events A formal and computational treatment of incremental non-atomic events will be formulated here, relying on model-theoretic logics and on the Generative Lexicon framework (GL henceforth; see Pustejovsky (1995) for an introduction). I will first discuss a few theoretical notions related to the internal structure of objects and events, in order to formalize m and i-incrementality. I will leave aside the treatment of incremental patharguments, referring the interested reader to White (1994). 4.1 Internal structure of objects and events : Link&apos;s part-of operators Following Link (1983), I will oppose individuals (i.e., the denotata of nouns referring to individual entities) and collections (i.e., the denotata of definite plural NPs, collectives, etc. ; see Caudal (1998a)). Let A be the domain of entities (events or objects), structured as a semilattice. Let individual_part_of be a partial order relation on individual entities (henceforth i-part or 5.4), connecting an individual to the collection it belongs to. Let U1 be the join operation on individuals and collections, y a collec</context>

This fact suggests that they should be set apart from other non-atomic events, and possibly receive subevents of a different kind. 7 See Caudal (1999b), where incremental vs. scalar RStages are introduced. 503 Conclusion It has been demonstrated in this paper that the so-called punctuality of achievements should be reduced to the notion of atomicity. Formal means to calculate it within an NLP system have been discussed; see White (1994) for a computational implementation of related interest, in a similar spirit. The machinery exposed above can be used to predict whether an event should be considered as an accomplishment (non-atomic event; possesses subevents) or an achievement (atomic event; lacks any subevent). The above developments revealed that (non-)atomicity is at least partly amenable to a compositional semantic procedure, and does not fall altogether under the scope of pragmatics. It has been shown to be directly related to incrementality in many cases, though not in all cases. In order to construe incremental nonato</context>
