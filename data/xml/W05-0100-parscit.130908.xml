This is the second workshop on effective tools and methodologies for teaching NLP and Computational
Linguistics. Recurring themes are the interdisciplinarity of the subject and the unexpected mismatches
between student background and what the instructor initially assumed. Some papers talk about
particular tools and assignments: are spelling checkers really as cool as we think? how much can
students be persuaded to like error analysis? is it fair to ask students to use research software when
they could be learning about more generally applicable tools? Others describe teaching approaches
conditioned by particular institutional and educational needs: what is it like teaching in a situation
where students typically can’t afford to buy even one textbook? can multiple universities co-ordinate a
continent-wide curriculum? There is a consistent and welcome effort to discuss not only successes but
also decisions that seem, at least in retrospect, to have been mistakes. We hope that all aspects of the
sharing of experience begun in the papers will continue during the workshop itself.
We are grateful to all the authors who submitted papers, and the following people, who served on the
program committee.
