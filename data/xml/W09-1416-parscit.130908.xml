We introduce a supervised approach for ex-
tracting bio-molecular events by using linguis-
tic features that represent the contexts of the
candidate event triggers and participants. We
use Support Vector Machines as our learning
algorithm and train separate models for event
types that are described with a single theme
participant, multiple theme participants, or a
theme and a cause participant. We perform ex-
periments with linear kernel and edit-distance
based kernel and report our results on the
BioNLP’09 Shared Task test data set.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999615">
Most previous work on biomedical information ex-
traction focuses on identifying relationships among
biomedical entities (e.g. protein-protein interac-
tions). Unlike relationships, which are in general
characterized with a pair of entities, events can be
characterized with event types and multiple entities
in varying roles. The BioNLP’09 Shared Task ad-
dresses the extraction of bio-molecular events from
the biomedical literature (Kim et al., 2009). We par-
ticipated in the “Event Detection and Characteriza-
tion” task (Task 1). The goal was to recognize the
events concerning the given proteins by detecting
the event triggers, determining the event types, and
identifying the event participants.
In this study, we approach the problem as a su-
pervised classification task. We group the event
types into three general classes based on the num-
ber and types of participants that they involve. The
first class includes the event types that are described
with a single theme participant. The second class in-
cludes the event types that are described with one or
more theme participants. The third class includes
the events that are described with a theme and/or
a cause participant. We learn support vector ma-
chine (SVM) models for each class of events to clas-
sify each candidate event trigger/participant pair as
a real trigger/participant pair or not. We use vari-
ous types of linguistic features such as lexical, posi-
tional, and dependency relation features that repre-
sent the contexts of the candidate trigger/participant
pairs. The results that we submitted to the shared
task were based on using a linear kernel function. In
this paper, we also report our results based on using
an edit-distance based kernel defined on the shortest
dependency relation type paths between a candidate
trigger/participant pair.

and Class 2 events, where the participants are proteins, the
participants of Class 3 events can be proteins or events.
Since the event types in each class are similar to
each other based on the number and roles of par-
ticipants that they involve and different from the
event types in the other classes, we learned sepa-
rate classification models for each class. We for-
mulated the classification task as the classification
of trigger/participant pairs. We extracted positive
and negative training instances (trigger/participant
pairs) from the training data for each class of events.
We considered only the pairs that appear in the
same sentence. We used the tokenized and sentence
split abstracts provided by the shared task organiz-
ers1. Consider the sentence “The phosphorylation of
TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 cytoplasmic do-
main”. This sentence describes the following three
events:

<bodyText confidence="0.999302210526316">
Event1 belongs to Class 1. The trigger/participant
pair (phosphorylation, TRAF2) is a positive instance
for Class 1. Event2 belongs to Class 2. It has
two theme participants. The instances for Class 2
events are created by decomposing the events into
trigger/theme pairs. The two positive instances ex-
tracted from the decomposition of Event2 are (bind-
ing, TRAF2) and (binding, CD40). Event3 belongs
to Class 3. It consists of two semantically differ-
ent participants, namely a theme and a cause. We
trained two separate models for Class 3 events, i.e.,
one model to classify the themes and another model
to classify the causes. Another distinguishing char-
acteristic of Class 3 events is that a participant of
an event can be a protein or an event. We repre-
sent the participants that are events with their cor-
responding event triggers. We decompose Event3
into its theme and cause and represent its cause
Event1 with its trigger word “phosphorylation” and

a result, (inhibits, binding) and (inhibits, phosphory-
lation) are included as positive instances to the Class
3 theme and Class 3 cause training sets, respectively.
Negative instances for Class 1 and Class 2 are cre-
ated by including all the trigger/protein pairs which
are not among the positive instances of that class.
Negative instances for Class 3 theme and Class 3
cause are created by including all the trigger/protein
and trigger1/trigger2 pairs which are not among the
positive instances of that class. For example, (phos-
phorylation, CD40) is a negative instance for Class
1 and (inhibits, TRAF2) is a negative instance for
Class 3 theme and Class 3 cause.

2.2 Feature Extraction
2.2.1 Lexical and Part-of-Speech Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996090909091">
We used the candidate trigger and its part-of-
speech, which was obtained by using the Stanford
Parser, as features, based on our observation that dif-
ferent candidate triggers might have different likeli-
hoods of being a real trigger for a certain event. For
example, “transcription” is a trigger for the Tran-
scription event 277 times in the training set and has
not been used as a trigger for other types of events.
On the other hand, “concentration” is used only
once as a trigger for a Transcription event and three
times as a trigger for Regulation events.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.589686">
2.2.2 Positional Features
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999667916666667">
We used two features to represent the relative po-
sition of the participant with regard to the trigger
in the sentence. The first feature has two values,
namely “before” (the participant appears before the
trigger) or “after” (the participant appears after the
trigger). The second feature encodes the distance
between the trigger and the participant. Distance is
measured as the number of tokens between the trig-
ger and the participant. Our intuition is that, if a
candidate trigger and participant are far away from
each other, it is less likely that they characterize an
event.

protein interactions (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007;
Erkan et al., 2007). In this paper, we use the
dependency paths to extract events. For a given
trigger/participant pair, we extract the shortest path
from the trigger to the participant, from the depen-
dency parse of the sentence. We use the McClosky-
Charniak parses which are converted to the Stan-
ford Typed Dependencies format and provided to the
participants by the shared task organizers. Previous
approaches use both the words and the dependency
relation types to represent the paths (Bunescu and
Mooney, 2007; Erkan et al., 2007). Consider the de-
pendency tree in Figure 1. The path from “phospho-
rylation” to “CD40” is “nsubj inhibits acomp bind-
ing prep to domain num”. Due to the large num-
ber of possible words, using the words on the paths
might lead to data sparsity problems and to poor
generalization. Suppose we have a sentence with
similar semantics, where the synonym word “pre-
vents” is used instead of “inhibits”. If we use the
words on the path to represent the path feature, we
end up with two different paths for the two sen-
tences that have similar semantics. Therefore, in
this study we use only the dependency relation types
among the words to represent the paths. For ex-
ample, the path feature extracted for the (phospho-
rylation, CD40) negative trigger/participant pair is
“nsubj acomp prep to num” and the path feature ex-
tracted for the (phosphorylation, TRAF2) positive
trigger/participant pair is “prep of”.

2.3 Classification

<bodyText confidence="0.999996277777778">
We used the SV Mlight library (Joachims, 1999)
with two different kernel functions and feature sets
for learning the classification models. Our first ap-
proach is based on using linear SVM with the fea-
tures described in Section 2.2. In this approach
the path feature is used as a nominal feature. Our
second approach is based on integrating to SVM a
kernel function based on the word-based edit dis-
tance between the dependency relation paths, where
each dependency relation type on the path is treated
as a word. For example, the word-based edit dis-
tance between the paths “prep of” and “prep of
prep with” is 1, since 1 insertion operation (i.e., in-
serting “prep with” to the first path) is sufficient to
transform the first path to the second one. The edit-
distance based similarity between two paths pi and
pj and the corresponding kernel function are defined
as follows (Erkan et al., 2007).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984904">
The data provided for the shared task is prepared
from the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2008). We used
the training and the development sets for training.
The candidate triggers are detected by using a dic-
tionary based approach, where the dictionary is ex-
tracted from the training set. We filtered out the
noisy trigger candidates such as “with”, “+”, “:”, and
“-”, which are rarely used as real triggers and com-
monly used in other contexts. The candidate trig-
ger/participant pairs are classified by using the clas-
sifiers learned for Class 1, Class 2, and/or Class 3
depending on whether the candidate trigger matched
one of the triggers in these classes. The SVM score
is used to disambiguate the event types, if a candi-
date trigger matches a trigger in more than one of the
event classes. A trigger which is ambiguous among
the event types in the same class is assigned to the
event type for which it is most frequently used as a
trigger.
The results that we submitted to the shared task
were obtained by using the linear SVM approach
with the set of features described in Section 2.2.
After submitting the results, we noticed that we
made an error in pre-processing the data set. While
aligning the provided dependency parses with the

sentence, we incorrectly assumed that all the sen-
tences had dependency parses and ended up using
the wrong dependency parses for most of the sen-
tences. The overall performance scores for our of-
ficial submission are 30.42% recall, 14.11% preci-
sion, and 19.28% F-measure. The results obtained
after correcting the error are reported in Table 1.
Correcting the error significantly improved the per-
formance of the system. Table 2 shows the re-
sults obtained by using SVM with dependency path
edit kernel. The two SVM models achieve similar
performances. The performance for the regulation
events is considerably lower, since errors in identi-
fying the events are carried to identifying the event
participants of a regulation event. The performances
for the events which have multiple participants, i.e.,
binding and regulation events, are lower compared
to the events with a single participant. The perfor-
mance is higher when computed by decomposing
the events (49.00 and 31.82 F-measure for binding
and regulation events, respectively). This suggests
that even when participants of events are identified
correctly, there is significant amount of error in com-
posing the events.

We perform experiments with linear kernel and edit-distance based kernel and report our results on the BioNLP’09 Shared Task test data set. 1 Introduction Most previous work on biomedical information extraction focuses on identifying relationships among biomedical entities (e.g. protein-protein interactions). Unlike relationships, which are in general characterized with a pair of entities, events can be characterized with event types and multiple entities in varying roles. The BioNLP’09 Shared Task addresses the extraction of bio-molecular events from the biomedical literature (Kim et al., 2009). We participated in the “Event Detection and Characterization” task (Task 1). The goal was to recognize the events concerning the given proteins by detecting the event triggers, determining the event types, and identifying the event participants. In this study, we approach the problem as a supervised classification task. We group the event types into three general classes based on the number and types of participants that they involve. The first class includes the event types that are described with a single theme participant. The second class includes the event types that are described with </context>
